Arjay J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1146,14,4,1.0,6/16/2013,"The experience was so unsatisfying, I didn't even stay due to poor customer service and racism. I came here on Father's Day expecting seating to be difficult, which it was, but understandable. I was told it would be about a 45 minute wait and accepted what I was told and left with the device that would buzz when a table should be ready I went outside to meet up with my family and let them know how long the wait would be, at which point, plans were to change as waiting wasn't a feasible option. And so, I went back to return the device I was handed, but was cut off by a lady. I didn't mind at the time because I had assumed she would have to wait anyway and I was just trying to return the buzzer. As I stood there, this lady was asking for seating for the same size party as mine and instead of giving her a buzzer to wait, they were immediately able to seat her! I was outraged and furious. Instead going to down the list to buzz someone who's been waiting of the same party size, the chose her instead, a white lady who just walked in. It's very offensive and very RACIST that they'd be given such exclusive service, especially since the waiting system is electronically systematic, leaving very little problem to find someone else who's been waiting to fill in the gap. The food here isn't bad, and for the most part, service is good, but the fact that something like that happened where most of what happens is already automated is unbelievable and could only happen with poor people skills and a lack of basic computing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=560
Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508,4.0,6/10/2012,"It's probably best to come here earlier than noon. We arrived at 11:45 am for lunch and were sat right away in the patio as requested. There were also plenty of seats inside as well. (As we were leaving, the place was so packed, there was a line outside the door waiting to put your name in). I think it's interesting that they have the check in downstairs and seating all upstairs. Escalators take you up and stairs lead the way down.  Service was good and attentive, he was very patient despite the fact that we were three ladies all together that just wanted to talk, he was always able to politely interrupt our talking to ask us questions and to ask if we wanted to order or if we wanted any refills.  Foodwise, I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich. It wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite thing. Could have had some more marinara sauce on the side with it, that part was delicious. They have a skinnylicious menu also for the weight conscious out there. My aunt got a salad that she loved, although it appeared to be side salad sized at a full price.  Chocolate cheese cake was amazing as always. My mom got the regular cheesecake and that was also up to their standard. I love the cheesecake here.  Would definitely dine here again and would try something different. The best part about this place is the location, right in the heart of The Grove.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=560
Bryden P.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,43,1,3.0,7/8/2015,"I had never been to the cheesecake factory. The waiter was awesome. I am vegan, he informed me of what had dairy in it and what didn't.

Kristin C.,"Lancaster, CA",21,16,,4.0,3/18/2016,"I came here for dinner with a group of friends on St. Patty's Day. They seemed really busy but we were seated right away. I was really impressed with how well staffed they were.  It seemed like all the workers helped each other out. Our server was great, even with all the chaos she was so professional and took her time to make sure she got everyone's order right. We had some tough orders, as one of my friends had to make sure everything she got was gluten free and most of us wanted substitutions!  Nice thing is that they have several gluten free options for those with restrictions.  The interior design of the restaurant is impressive. They have a tall escalator to take you to the seating area, and they have booths by glass windows that give you a great view of the Grove. I saw them, but unfortunately we didn't get seated there. The food was tasty, I got the Crispy Shrimp Sandwich which was good. The portions are large as well. The only bad thing was that the lighting was so dark we couldn't really read the menu without using our phone flashlights. Other than that this is a great place for dinner. I guess the low lighting might set the mood for a romantic date.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=560

Charlie B.,"West Hollywood, CA",87,65,18,4.0,2/25/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has amazing food and menu, no matter the locations I've be too. We do go to the Grove location often because it is close but we are always weary of how busy it is. Unless it's off peak hours don't ever expect a short wait. Lately we always just head straight to the bar area to try our luck. So far we've had decent luck and find a high table within 15 mins or so.  The last time I have to admit our server, was nice but he did an awful time of managing his time but most of the time our service is usually pretty good. So int his case I gave it four stars due to consistency and great food. They recently just added a chicken Katsura plate to their menu and it is fantastic, I've ordered twice in a row. If you don't like spicy food, just have them take out the siracha sauce. Can't ever go wrong with avocado egg rolls, my favorite. I also love the chicken Romano.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=560
Yana D.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,4,,1.0,7/24/2015,"The worst location ever! I usually very satisfied with food, drinks and services at Cheesecake factory ( their herb crusted salmon is the best ). But at the Grove it was a disaster!!! 1st of all they forgot about us (system glitch as we were told) and we've been waiting around 1 hour to be seated. Then we've ordered apple martinis with cattle one vodka and I believe the bartender forgot to add any vodka not just the one we've requested. Tataki tuna salad that I usually order at other locations was much smaller and tasted not that good!! Won't go there again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=560

Michael M.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,17,3,1.0,6/25/2015,The wait is ridiculous! You wait downstairs for the amount they tell you give or take and when you do finally get the text saying your ready to be seated you are sent upstairs to wait some more time. What kind of idiot thought that through. I wasn't the only one getting frustrated over this either.and on top of that there were people that got here after us being seated first. When we finally got showed to our seats the table wasn't even cleared or reset yet.

Veronica H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,10,,1.0,10/14/2015,"I've frequented several Cheesecake Factory restaurants from various locations in and out of the state.  Typically, the food and service is good.  However, my family was in town and we were meeting family at the CF at the Grove, where we had never been, since I am fairly new in town.  Beautiful facility.  However, the service was less than average. They took forever to seat us and refused to sit us outside as we requested because as they told us we had a party of seven and it was a fire hazard to connect the tables.  We looked out and saw several tables that were close enough together in the same vicinity that still would have worked, but yet they continued to fight this.  Fortunately, a server came out, after close to 30 minutes of sending us back and forth, and told us it would be okay to sit there. She then actually pulled our tables together.  Another server came out to take our order.  He was nice.  It appeared that everyone ordered their food successfully..except me.  I was feeling under the weather and had a migraine, so I simply ordered a Chicken Caesar salad.  The salad came out soggy like it had been sitting for a while somewhere.  The dressing on it did not taste like a typical Caesar salad dressing.  It was also very bland and quite off putting and there wasn't much on the salad,  The chicken was definitely flavorless.  I eventually told another server who replaced the original guy I placed the order with.  He took it back and brought out another supposedly fresh salad.  At this point, everyone else had finished their food, so I asked for a to-go-box.  Initially, the lettuce appeared to be fresher and crisper than before.  Therefore, I took everything to go before eating again.  However, the chicken was rubbery, hard, and flavorless.  The dressing was lifeless and he only gave me one small container full, so it basically was only enough to cover a few top pieces of lettuce.  Also, the croutons were stale. Wow!!!  $17.99 for this salad?  Very disappointing!!!!  And really....How in the world can any restaurant mess up a simple Caesar salad?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=560

Chris L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/7/2015,"Attn: HQ Team Calabasas Where do I start with this beyond unsatisfactory performance and review?  First, a bit of history.  I have been a cheesecake factory customer for just about the beginning of time. I have spent countless birthdays, anniversaries, and special occasionss with family and friends. This includes multiple locations in Las Vegas (Caesar Shoppes) and Calfornia (The Grove, Americana, Sherman Oaks etc.). Although customer service has rarely been up to par, I have remained a loyal and devoted guest. Up until a recent visit @ their Grove location, I have decided to part ways and take my business to oher eating establishmens that will serve me or any other party as they should ""A guest."" I am not VIP or claim to be more special, but I was not aware I needed to be to receive the fundamental purpose of eating out which is to have an ""Experience"" and a great social gathering with great food amongst love one's and friends. The reviews before me are consistent, and definitely show insight as to how broken processes, operations, and talent management are.  It took 1 hour and 15 minutes to be checked in, 30 minutes after check in to be seated, 20 minutes to get a waiter (rude, bad demeanor), 20 mins to get our drinks, an interval of 45 mins to order,  and I can go on. Beyond that, management requested my wife to move so ""Other guest could be more comfortable!"" Wait... I'm not a guest?  This was by far the worst experience to the point that we didn't finish our meals amd requested the check early. In closing, I feel trends and history are great tools to understand behaviors, and can be utilized to strategically implement efficiency measures. Please take it from a long time customer, there are far more better choices out there that will deliver a consistent experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=600

Shirley D.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",326,259,20,3.0,11/30/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a pretty consistent restaurant. I wish they would narrow down their menu and really work on the flavor and quality of their dishes. Two entrees,  two drinks,  and two appetizers came out to about 90 bucks..pretty hefty for the quality of food you get even though the portions are big. I ordered the cajun pasta but it was just a brickload of pasta w.nothing but olive oil and overseasoned chicken and shrimp thrown on top..supposedly one of their best dishes.I highly disagree. It was a great dissapointment.  The wait here was about an hour and from being here before,  I know the wait is usually that long.  Its an okay place to come when your w.a group and looking to find a chill place where you can be loud.

Arturo C.,"Rowland Heights, CA",2,2,1,1.0,8/12/2014,"Went in for a birthday dinner tonight and I wanted a table for 12, I was asked if two tables NEXT to each other was fine, and I agreed. When I got my tables they give me two booths back to back.. I was quick to say that that's not what I was told, I did not request 2 booths, you can't have my party divided. We were told two tables. Their response was ""they are next to each other"". Clearly someone does not know the difference ""behind and next to"", the girl was rude and did not tend to our needs. Also, when people from my party were not at the restaurant, but on their way up, our second booth was empty. Minutes later, after the host gave us a 5 minute ultimatum, they gave away our table to another party without notifying us. We asked several times to speak with a manager but no manage came when requested. It wasn't until a while later, after we noticed someone who looked like a manager walk past our table multiple times, that that person stopped by and tried to explain their rationale behind their actions.

Roughly 25 minutes later, I receive a text indicating that our table was ready and to head over to the hostess booth. We did that and found ourselves standing in a crowded area around the booth with several other different parties waiting. I tell the hostess that I received a text and she tells me to wait a moment. So they began seating some of the other parties but 10 minutes later, I ask again and they tell me to wait (I didn't even mention my name). I'm normally not the one to complain but at least acknowledge me (with eye contact) and make the impression that my inquiries matter. Probably 25 minutes after I received the text, we finally got our table. Our server was great but there was a period where we had to wonder when our order was coming.

Christina V.,"Downey, CA",92,25,62,1.0,12/22/2014,"I was very upset yesterday when my family visited the grove cheesecake for the very first time and had the most unwelcoming experience not only by the host but by the same manager. I think her man was anora. You can tell she does not work good under pressure and I used to be manager at a restaurant and it was unacceptable.  The host said the wait would be 45 min to an hour which we thought was reasonable. We had a party of 12. After almost 2hours of waiting we asked the host if our table was ready. They said we still needed a while. We said how long and they told us 3 more hours. We felt like they just wanted us to leave. After speaking to the manager saying we already had been waiting there 2 hours she said their was nothing she could do for us. It was first of all not out fault that the 2 host in the front said it was a 45 to an hour wait. Or else we would have never waited to begin with. The host said she mistakingly meant 4-5 hour wait. Which no one in their right mind would stay. The manager didn't offer us anything or offered us splitting tables. She could care less. We even over heard her saying to the host that she backed them up. In my opinion the customer was right because they were the ones with the mistake. My family was so disappointed at their first time at the grove and first time at Cheesecake Factory that to be honest we felt the manager was a bit racist and unprofessional. I bet 100$ if we were white business men she would have made it possible. It doesn't matter if the restaurant is busy, they need a bit more organization and professionalism.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=800

Orla H.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",59,103,,2.0,3/7/2011,"The two stars above are for the cheesecake and that alone! I guess when you go to a restaurant named for its desserts the rest of the menu is kind of superfluous but inedible?? But I'm getting ahead of myself here... I've only been to the States a handful of times and never experienced this place so I was super excited when some friends brought us. It was extremely busy and the staff were disorganized to say the least. After waiting downstairs we were then called and sent for some more waiting upstairs where the staff gave our table to some one else. After some half hearted apologies we were led to our table and given a menu the size of a book, is there really a need for it to be that long? Not to mention the fact that the lighting is so low I had to squint to read any of it.  Our waitress returned and took our orders, lemon herb roasted chicken for me. All the dishes came out at different times, around 10 mins between first & last. My chicken was dreadful, overcooked and dryer than the desert. The potatoes were delicious at least. I wished I had ordered the chicken marsala which my companion had and I tasted. It was delicious, moist and tender. The difference astounded me, it's the same bird!!  Moving on, our waitress returned and removed the dishes and presented the dessert menu to us with so much enthusiasm I thought her head might explode. Three of us ordered cheesecake, lemon raspberry for me. It was the best dessert I've eaten in a long time, so creamy and packed full of flavour. I also tasted the red velvet, heavenly, and the mango key lime, a little sweet for me.  Our super smiley waitress came back and delivered the bill while we were still eating, a little rude I thought. Ruder still was when she attempted to take it before we'd had a chance to look at it. Very subtle love, next time just say you need the table.

First issue was that it was 11pm and the wait was about 30 minutes, second the seating sucks I literally was right next to two other tables and felt like it was just one big table, and third the restrooms were disgusting; I am not even over exaggerating! I ordered the bang bang chicken which I thought was good. Friend ordered the mac n cheese burger and it tasted like a giant big mac with extra salt!! His dish was disgusting. It was a big salty disaster! The strawberry lemonade was the best that I've had. The latte was yummy after the meal. Mmm... Waiter was very tentative. Although our table sucked, the restaurant appeared to have pretty nice seating for booths. Loud music however, even with that it still didn't drown out the other tables conversations.  I think I'll give this place one more shot. Just because the restaurant was nice and food was good.

The waitress offered to box it, and she picked up my plate and then proceed to stack the other diners plates on top of my plate squashing my burger!  She apologized and offered to bring me a new bun.  I took the plate from her and told her to bring the box to me instead. I should have immediately went to look for the manager, so she could be reprimanded in front of the whole table who witnessed this. She clearly despised her job, my friend remarked that she was a phony, just what I was thinking.  She brought over a box and a new bun, apologizing again.  I enjoyed the food here more than I expected, though 3 stars is good enough for this place.

When we refused to sit there the waitress got a nasty attitude and got the hostess, she got us a table together which was easy to do the first time so I have no idea what the fuss was about since they automatically charge an 18% tip no matter what crummy service they provide.

Cae C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,3.0,4/13/2014,"Food outstanding!  Service, way below average.   It's been awhile since I've dined here.  I remember the food always being great, and it was great again.  However, on this visit, I took note of how the restaurant took special care to label items on the menu like ""Gluten-Free"", ""Contains Dairy"" or ""Nuts"".  There's even a special, separate, low-cal menu.  For a restaurant like CHEESECAKE FACTORY, which has such an extensive menu anyway, to include extra touches such as these is, well, impressive.  I'm a diner with more than one serious allergy and it's nice to have a well-known choice in my wheelhouse, so thank you Cheesecake Factory!  You even had a piece of cheesecake I could eat.  I'm still smiling. Unfortunately, our server, was aloof when he was taking care of us but mostly not there at all.  He greeted us with, ""I'm going on my break.""  I've worked in the service industry for over twenty years and I understand breaks need to happen and there's never a good time for them; however, his opening line was terrible and the service was worse.  About ten minutes later, we received our water and bread (we were ready to order and he still hadn't gone on his break) but he didn't ask, he just dropped the water and bread and left, not making eye contact.  Finally, another server took our order.  Our food came (and it was amazing thank goodness).  I had to ask for more ketchup from three different people.  Finally, our server brought it to me after he came and went to the table right next to us about four times.  We had to ask for iced tea refills and struggled to actually find someone to ask.  When we finally received more iced tea, we were finished with our meal.  We had to ask for dessert menus and then only my friend received one, I had to ask for one too, again.  When the cheesecake arrived, we had no silverware.  Our server dropped the cheesecake and disappeared for about five minutes saying he would be back with silverware & napkins.  I'm not sure why we needed a new napkin for dessert.  When he returned he presented a mis en place filled with silverware, indicating for us to grab our own silverware, but never actually speaking to us.  Really?  Is that sanitary?!  What if I had the flu?  And I'm digging into the mis en place where ALL the other guests are also grabbing their silverware?  It seemed rather odd to me. One thing I was grateful for regarding our server, he asked if I had a parking ticket to validate.  I did.  And if it weren't for his reminder, I would have forgot.  This one little gesture is how I know our server didn't mean to give bad service.  Maybe he was new, still working out his procedure, his style, I'm not sure.  I don't write reviews often unless I feel someone can learn something.  In this case, I think it might be important to review the basics with some of the younger wait staff.  MAKE EYE CONTACT.  No silverware, no food!  Communicate but don't share information your guest doesn't need to know (find a mature delivery).  Go out!  Be a diner at least once a week, it creates empathy for your guest.  But the most important thing, ASK FOR HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT. I love The Cheesecake Factory.  It's my parent's favorite restaurant.  I send them gift certificates all the time!  I'm not trying to be harsh, just trying to help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=800

One of them finally gave me one of those ""beepers"" that flashes and vibrates when your table is ready. We asked him if it would be okay to go to the Barnes and Noble nearby and he said yes. Our wait was 35 minutes. So about 45 long minutes later we made it back to the restaurant. I was STARVING and I asked the host if our table was finally ready. He said that he had called but we didn't show up. Now, either the beeper thing had to be broken or he didn't call because I was so hungry that I didn't let that thing out of my sight and I know that as soon as the thing flashed I would have run over there to get some food.  So after waiting 5 more minutes, we get sent up and again the hosts are not helpful. I tell another male host I got called for my table and he said in a condescending tone ""oh your table CALLED? you WANT a table or you're here for a reservation?"" WHAT?!?! That jerk. It's not my fault I've never been to the place and I'm a little lost. Our waitress was very nice and helpful, the food was REALLY good. I had the fettucine alfredo with chicken. I'm a fatty so a couple more chunks of chicken would have been good, and the servings were huge, big enough for two.

I was with just one friend and she LITERALLY IGNORED US; I was trying to get her attention for a refill and she tended to the table of four the most, maybe because they generate more money or tip...idk. She kept asking the other tables if they were doing ok and failed to even make eye contact with us!!  When we were ready for our check, she gave us the wrong one and TOOK OFF FOR 10-15min!!!

Xuan T.,"Los Angeles, CA",220,250,229,4.0,7/15/2009,"When you head to the Cheesecake Factory, let's assume their specialty involves cheesecake. So, needless to say that I had no interest in 80% of their menu.  I looked around  at the surrounding tables and saw people feasting on large portions of pastas and salads and sandwiches.  I sat there flabbergasted.  Shouldn't the focus be dessert? I can safely give this place 4 stars because I only sampled their desserts.  I chose the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake with coffee and my boyfriend decided on having the warm apple crisp.  Both desserts were presented to us in ginormous portions and 2 extra plates for sharing. We engorged ourselves in delicious refined sugar.  The cheesecake was fantastic.  The balance between chocolate and coconut was juuuuuust right.  Not too sweet, and yummy enough to make you crave an extra bite even though you already busted a button.   The warm apple crisp was also good, especially since it was served toasty and a la mode.  But for some reason, I wasn't exactly dazzled by it.  I guess it's because the flavors are so traditional and expected.  It's hard to be pleasantly surprised by something that was essentially an apple pie. This is a great place to go for a sweet treat.  Some may think it strange to go to lunch/dinner in one restaurant and then dessert someplace else.  But, I think it's always better to go to an establishment based on their strengths.  If you go to a steakhouse, don't order the chicken.  If you go to the cheesecake factory, don't order the sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=740

Greg A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,19,,3.0,8/23/2015,"*ELEVATOR ISSUE*  This morning my wife and I took our 5-month old child to the Grove for brunch.  We used the elevator from the lobby because we had the baby in a stroller.  When the elevator reached the second floor it abruptly jolted, made a huge bang and dropped about 5-10 inches.  The elevator repeated this sequentially about 7 times.  It then got quiet for a second - I told my wife i thought we were stuck - and then the doors opened.  We were not injured, the baby was not hurt but it was scary (SERIOUSLY).  It frightened me enough that when I got off I couldn't control my laughter mostly because it really scared the crap out of me.  My wife was not amused.  For context: I've had the misfortune of being stuck in an immobilized elevator for about three hours in college and it didn't bother me one bit.  I am not claustrophobic and am generally a calm person.  Whatever this elevator was doing was no-joke scary.  My issue however; is not with the elevator - it is with the nature of which our reporting it was summarily dismissed as if it were not to be taken seriously.  I am no elevator expert but it could be a serious safety concern and it needs to be checked by a licensed elevator service repairman.  My wife reported it to the hostess who seated us.  To be fair, I was laughing becuase I was relieved that I didn't do a Final Destination into the ground floor but I, too, reiterated to the hostess that something was really wrong with the elevator and nobody should be using it until it gets checked.  The hostess was young and may have not fully grasped what we were relaying so we, again, reiterated to her that this was not funny and needed to be addressed.  She immediately acknowledged this and took it more seriously when we insisted we weren't joking and she began to report it to her manager (I think it was the manager) who just dismised her entirely and said something to the effect of, ""yeah I will check it just get these people seated.""  The manager's dismissal was wholly unprofessional for the following reasons:  1.  We were complaining to a hostess of probably 18 years old who was clearly not the person to handle this complaint and when she escalated it to her manager - the woman (a blonde in her mid to late 40's) did not say one word to us.  She was more worried about getting the brunch crowd seated than a potentially serious safety complaint.  At the time there was nobody else waiting.  She had time to address us and chose not to.  2. We had a baby in a stroller on the elevator.   Nobody said, ""hey we are sorry, let us check that out"".  It would have at least been small comfort that the next person wasn't going to get demolished by a broken elevator.  3. The manager could not have cared less and never asked us to specifically describe what happened.  Just usher us on to the table and back to work.  I did see the manager go get on the elevator, I think ride it down and back up.  She got off and that was that.  Never a question about specifically what went wrong, what was she looking for, etc... We sat for the next few minutes discussing how sad it would be if someone got seriously injured on the elevator because nobody was listening.  We relayed the information to the couple who joined us a few minutes later and eventually got on with our meal.  I'd like to make sure whoever reads this understands that my complaint is not with the hostess or the elevator problem itself - but with the casual dismissal that the manager gave in not caring the least about a potential safety issue.  Unless she is some kind of qualified elevator technician - her riding it up and down once hardly counts as checking it for a safety issue.  Please have someone that checks this kind of thing (probably have one that works for the Grove, it's a huge place) look into this ASAP. As an aside - about my dining experience: 1. My coffee was luke-warm when I got the first cup.  Whatever, it tasted fine, I drank it and usually finish a cup of coffee by the time it's reached room temperature anyway.  I do have my doubts as to whether or not it was made this morning.  It's been in a mug or pot overnight and was slightly warmer than tap water.  When it was refilled it was the proper temperature of a fresh cup of coffee.  This it NOT a complaint as I really don't mind, just an observation for Quality Control. 2. When seated my table was greasy with butter streaks.  It's not likely someone already had a meal since this location only opens 25 minutes before we were seated so whoever wiped the table down did not go a good job.  I had to use my napkin to wipe off the butter streaks.  It was clear someone with a seriously dirty table cloth had wiped it off but was still super gross to set my arms in butter streaks.  This was the only uncool part of my actual dining experience. I did not complain to anyone about this and wiped it up myself - also not a huge deal as I am not a little baby. 3.  Our waiter was great.  A young guy, super cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=740

I then went to the reception desk and asked to see a manager, waited for 10 minutes and no one came.  I was getting impatient and explained what happened to the receptionist, gave her a description of the three people and what they were wearing.  She was trying to get new guests seated and talk to me at the same time and at one point, she asked me to wait longer.  Another 5-10 minutes went by and as I was waiting, one of the young men came up the escalator, ducked as he was going thru the reception area and I immediately alerted her that one of the young men was still here and that he had just passed by.  I was sure that was him, as he was wearing the same clothes and hair style.  Unfortunately she said that she had to get one of her male co-workers to further look into this. I understand the reason the reception desk worker hesitated, but having me wait for a total of 20 minutes and not being able to alert the manager and report this incident immediately was frustrating to me.  I know this happened to us because we were not cautious enough, and at the same time I don't want this happening to anyone else.  So please be aware that there are three people going around targeting naive guests at this restaurant to try to gain access to their phones and all the information it carries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=980

solange s.,"Beverly Hills, CA",8,131,23,3.0,1/15/2014,"This was my first visit to this particular Cheesecake Factory in The Grove.  While the food was very good, the service could have used some improvement.  I was with two friends.  We asked our waitress what kind of table water they served.  She told us that it was tap water, not even filtered water, but tap water.  So we decided to get bottled water instead.  Perhaps they do that on purpose, so we'll have to buy our water.  My friend's menu was dirty and covered with food bits, so much so that she had to request a new one and make a trip to the bathroom to wash her hands.  Then, she noticed that her silverware was also not very clean, so that went back, too.  We all ordered from the light eating menu, two of us ordering hamburgers that required ketchup.  There was none on the table.  In fact, there were no condiments at all.  I'm not even sure there was salt and pepper.  We asked the waitress for it, and ten minutes later, she still had not come back with it.  So, we were obliged to ask a waiter for it.  At least,  he got back pretty quickly.  Like I said, the food was good, so no complaints there, I just think that I'd like to eat somewhere clean that knows how to place condiments on the table and that cares enough about their customers to not serve the recycled sewer water that comes from the city taps.  The one in Beverly Hills is much, much better, and the unique restaurants at the Farmers' Market a lot more interesting.  The best part of eating here was spending time with my friends.   I give those ladies five stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=980

Sadie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,5.0,1/7/2015,"I eat at this location quite a bit but am writing this regarding my 12/27/14 visit with my mom. We were told it would take an hour and a half to two hours to be seated but received a text message about an hour and fifteen minutes later that our table was ready. Took us maybe seven minutes to get there and we were told to wait to be seated. After twenty minutes I complained asking why we were contacted that our table was ready and after hearing from the hostess we took too long to get back, etc. we were seated on the outside patio which was not very good for me and my cold especially given that night was so cold. We ordered the artichokes to start and when we received them they were dry and had no meat. I let the waiter (Jesse) know and he said he would get another one. This is when Patrick, the manager, came to our table and apologized for the artichoke and asked if everything else was okay since it appeared it had been visible to Jesse I wasn't happy from the beginning. Patrick sat down with us, I explained the wait for the table, he apologized, offered to move us inside and was so beyond pleasant that I got over the wait, cold, and artichoke. The artichoke was replaced, it was perfect and both Jessie and Patrick gave us the best attention and service the rest of the night. Patrick stopped by our table again and even offered me a scarf! We enjoyed a delicious dinner and dessert which is what I think is always a guarantee at the Cheesecake Factory and had a very good rest of the evening. When the check came, the artichoke was completely comped even though the replacement was perfect. My mom and I were so impressed by Patrick and his attitude, he's a true reflection of what a manager should be. And Jesse was an amazing waiter!

Justin K.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,68,71,3.0,6/17/2011,"This was actually my first time at The Cheesecake Factory. Yeah, I suppose this review might be slightly biased, but sorry. When I went in, the place was bustling with activity. My group and I (approximately 10 people) waited about a little over 5 minutes in line just to get to the front desk. Once at the front desk, they told us we had a 30 minute wait or so to be seated together. It was 20 minutes. So that wasn't too bad.  The inside of the restaurant is actually very dark. Too dark for my liking. You pretty much can't see your food that well...And the place is pretty loud so if you're looking for a quiet dinner, forget it.  Our waiter wasn't too bad. He was a bit late at times and did forget my friend's order (he did make up for it with complimentary cheesecake or soup of the day) but he was okay. One thing I did NOT like about him was his continuous 'probing' if we wanted anything more. I mean it's his job to make sure to check up on us, but I believe it was a tad bit too much. :x Onto the good stuff. Their bread is really good. They have two types: sourdough and wheat. They continuously give you bread/butter in case your mouth gets lonely. :D Yay! We ordered fried calamari and quesadillas for appetizers. I have to say that their appetizers were WAY better than my actual entree. Their batter was really crispy and nice but the calamari inside was so soft (in a good way)! Dipping in the tartar sauce made it like 10x better. Their quesadillas were also super good. Very big and cheesy accompanied with guacamole (chunky just the way I like it ;D ), sour cream, and salsa. The food was just okay. Well, my dish was. I ordered the spicy chipotle chicken pasta, which was bland and I wasn't too fond of it. I took about half of it in a to-go box. The pasta was okay and the sauce tasted funny. My other friends ordered steaks, which were good from what they said. The fries that came with them (sweet potato and regular) were no-nos. Another friend of mine got something ""Thai chicken wrap"" or something like that. It was pretty good considering that over half of the dish lacked carbohydrates/protein. Other than that, I'd rate the food a 3.5 (only my dish though). Onto desserts. Most of my group did not get desserts because we were stuffed. I forgot to mention. The portions are HUGE. No joke. I guess that's one other thing that's good about this place. They also have a cr** load of cheesecake options. You can pretty much imagine a chocolate company/type and add cheesecake to it and they'll have it on their menu. Pretty cool. But then again, it's called ""The Cheesecake Factory"". :D Although my initial experience was not what I expected mostly because of my dish, I believe that going here a 2nd time would be most helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=980

Michelle B.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,28,13,4.0,1/3/2009,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factorys all across the country. Some things are the same, some different. Here's my review of this one (at the Grove). One thing, which astonishingly is the same at every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to: Don't go here if you're in a hurry. In fact, if you have any time issues that day at all, don't go here. Go only if you have a good half day to kill and can laze around eating good food. And I'm so serious about that. I can't tell you how many times I raised my own blood pressure when I forgot that about the Cheesecake Factory. If you've waited less than a half hour at any Cheesecake Factory, you are doing amazingly well. Plan on an hour before you even get seated. I'm so serious. At the Grove, they also have the added hassle of not enough seating while you're waiting. So, even before you get to the main seating guy, there's a pre-seating guy outside. You leave your name with him/her, and wait. Then, you go inside, and wait some more. If you're lucky, after about half an hour, maybe you can grab a seat on the one bench they have there. Just about the time your skin is crawling and you are thinking: ""GOD, screw this! The food isn't THAT good..."" they'll call your name, or your buzzer will blink and vibrate, and up the long escalator you'll go. Where you'll be greeted by another seating person. (sigh) And wait. Sigh. Finally, finally, you get to your table. Do yourself a favor, immediately. Order an appetizer with your drink, as soon as the wait person gets there. I recommend the firecracker rolls. You will thank me for this later. You do this  because you have a long wait ahead of you until you see food, or possibly a server again. Plus, the menu is GIGANTIC. It's seriously like twelve pages long. The first two pages are drinks. A couple pages of appetizers. Then six pages of entrees. All of them are amazing. Trust me, I've had a lot of stuff on their menu. This is why you deal with the excruciating, wanna slit your wrists wait. THE FOOD. The food is mind-blowingly astonishingly incredibly awesome. In fact, whenever anyone has said, ""Hey, let's go to the Cheesecake Factory!"" there has never been a time I said No. One of my most frequent choices is the popcorn chicken, served with yummy mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. But there is everything from Thai choices to pizza to pasta to great salads. Incredible food. And I always always always end up taking it home because there is so much of it. Well, that and the fact that you most often want to save room for dessert. Because after all, it is the CHEESECAKE Factory. And when I say they have cheesecake, sweet Lordy, do they have cheesecakes. Pumpkin and chocolate and strawberry and hazelnut and peanut butter whatever flavor you crave. Cheesecakes for the holidays. Cheesecakes that you only dream of. Every cheesecake you can imagine. They are all fantastic. I have actually gone in there a couple times and NOT ordered any cheesecake, and endured the withering glances from the waiters. Because really, you HAVE to have the cheesecake here. There is really no other restaurant that I would endure such a nail-bitingly long wait for, but the Cheesecake Factory redeems itself every single time with their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=980

I know it is a popular and a good restuarant, but they really need to solve this issue, find more space and expand !! second problem, most receptionist downstairs who arrange the seatings are always gloomy and in a bad mood, they seem bored and unhappy with their work, at times rude like when you ask for a seat it is like asking them a mountain to climb, there is not the smiles and greetings that i would expect from a place like this. finally the food, I have to be honest, most of the times, they make really good food here, but recently, it seems there is a drop in quality, probably because of the crowded seats and high demand. the problem i usually have is with the Fillet Mingion, I always ask for it to be well done. last time i went i asked for it to be coocked well done, but i got it medium, which happens a lot , right ? so i asked to recoock it, so it was taken and brought back few minutes later, but it was still medium !! i was like WHAT !? i asked again to make it more coocked, third time and again brought back medium rare, seriously they have a problem. I finally returned it, and they were good enough not to charge me. but what is the point getting there if im not gonna get my meals coocked right.

The real reason to come here is for the cheesecake, but half of the time, I get so full on the bread, appetizer and/or entree that there is no room for dessert.  That's what happened to me this time.  Bummer!  I should wise up and just come in to order cheesecake to go.

Normally, we would never even go to a place like this. But, after a tiring afternoon of shopping at the Grove, I wanted to pick something up to take home for dinner.  You have to fight the massive crowd of idjits downstairs to get upstairs to the dining room. I made my way to the take out area and placed my order. That part was fine. The bad part? The order took FOREVER and there was nowhere to sit. Nothing. Nada. Not even a counter to lean on. I've got a really bad back. So by the time my order was ready, all I wanted was a good pair of orthopedic shoes, a chenille robe and a goddamned nap! The only good part? The food. My boyfriend had the Pasta Bolognese and I had the Shrimp with Angel Hair.  Both were pretty tasty.  But the cheesecake? MAJOR disappointment. The guy who took my order recommended the Key Lime Cheesecake. Not. Good. Kind of bland. Nothing special. Which was shocking, since the only thing you really expect to be awesome at the friggin' 'Cheesecake Factory'? Is the friggin' cheesecake. I'd probably try this place again.

To be honest, when he told me that his dad went with Cheesecake Factory, I was pretty disappointed, but free is free and I wasn't gonna complain. The Grove on a beautiful Saturday night right before the Holidays is a scene. There's no way around it. We managed to find parking and fought our way thru the crowds (there was some sort of holiday show going on which made it even MORE crowded) but once we found our way into the Factory they made sure it was smooooooooth sailing. Once we gave the clerk our name and told them we had a catering order it was Mr. K this and Mr. K that. They were practically falling all over themselves to make us happy. They went thru the contents of each box with us, provided us with help out to the car and the manager made an appearance as well, making sure we had his business card to call him if we ran into any issues. I mean, it was all just a little over the top - in a good way. When we got the food home, I was surprised! It totally didn't suck and to be honest I actually liked the Chicken Madeira alot. It was pretty damn tasty. And the Avocado Eggrolls were pretty good too! Oh and the Pumpkin Cheesecake.... um. yeah.  I don't see myself saying, I really want Cheesecake Factory tonight!

Which brings me to my order tonight. I settled for the Shephard's Pie.  I TOTALLY LOVE the Irish version of the Shephard's Pie but decided to try this one due to the veggie content. Flavor - excellent (1 star) Food Quality - excellent (1 star) Ingredients - partially acceptable but questionable. (-1 star)  Cheesecake (Didn't order this time, but the Keylime Cheesecake is ALWAYS a star. (1 star) No need to dwell on Flavor and Food Quality as each held it's own.  Now the ingredients, well let's just say I renamed it the Mushroom Pie instead of Shepherd's pie. Who made the cook mad tonight and caused him to pour approximately 2 cups of mushrooms in a to go order size of the Shepherd's Pie.  Clearly, it was not made to order and given that, I can only imagine how many mushrooms were used for this pie.  Visual:  standard saucer sized portion with 1/4 cups of medium to large sized cooked mushrooms.  This is the amount I removed from the saucer-sized portion.  But where was the beef?  Yes, beef was in the pie, but more mushrooms than beef were alarming.  The beef is the base of a Shephard's Pie, not vegetables primarily the mushrooms.   So, if you LOVE mushrooms. order the mushroom pie, aka Shephard's Pie on the menu,  the next time you order and you will be delighted.   **Please omit typos as I still have a migraine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=20

I ordered the two mojitos, buffalo blasts and garlic noodles with shrimp. Hubby ordered a strawberry milkshake, fried Mac n cheese and fettuccine Alfredo. The bill was $155 and it kind of shocked me. I was thinking maybe $100 but $155 for the quality and portions we received def was not worth it.  Our waitress was clearly over booked. Anytime you have to flag down a busboy cleaning another table to ask for a refill on your water that's a problem! The only real Pros were the two mojitos. They were delicious and since I hit the skinny version they were under 150 cals!  Doubt we'll be visiting anytime soon. TBH I'd only come back with a gift card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=20

Brooke Z.,"Beverly Hills, CA",392,44,120,5.0,6/20/2017,"Is it just me or is The Cheesecake Factory wildly underrated?! Their menu is more expansive than almost any other restaurant I can think of, and the food is GOOD. Honestly I would just go for how great the appetizer bread is!  Real talk, the portions are very generous for a price that will not break your budget! Have you tried their Chinese Chicken Salad?! Only $15 and that thing is the size of 3 meals!  Another one of my favorite things this restaurant provides is the Skinnylicious menu! I adore the Asian Chicken Lettuce Wraps - light and delicious! Another one of my favorites that you have to try if you haven't yet-- (not on the Skinnylicious menu) Mac n cheese balls! So great for a shareable appetizer!  This location at the Grove - just like every other Cheesecake location I've visited - has a beautiful ambiance full of classy decor and a helpful/friendly/professional staff.

Cheesecake Factory is a brand and unfortunately not quality for more than a decade.  I went to the grove to eat at the steak house, but  they closed. Seems like every restaurant here only lasts a few years at tops. So I was forced to go there. Unfortunately I was let down yet again. I ordered Hibachi Steak Med-rare and got med- well.  Also the mashed potatoes were cold. Lack of Presentation. Typical and upsetting. For paying over $20+ I personally think I would of enjoyed a double whopper from burger king more than I did here. Never Again will I make the same mistake. Another thing is sanitation.

Adrineh A.,"Pasadena, CA",0,9,4,1.0,12/21/2017,"Extremely bad service!  It was my mom's memorial and 5 sisters decided to have lunch at one of our's and her favorite restaurant yesterday at the Grove around 3 PM.   We ordered a big mixed salad to share, but they brought the salad with no plates and no serving utensils.  We had to use our bread plates to eat our salad and our own forks to serve. Then we ordered 3 herb crusted Salmon and 2 steak Diane's with no onions; one well done and one medium well.  First they brought the 3 herb crusted salmon, one of which was not fully cooked (I found out later after we left - if not I would have returned it), which my sister did not eat.   Then there was about 7 minutes gap and they brought the well done steak, and it had the ONIONS ... another 5 minutes goes by, and finally my medium well steak shows up, totally well done!  Eeks ...  The meat was not the prime meat that I had the pleasure of experincing in their other locations.  It was fatty, chewy and poorly cut (more like a stew meat than steak meat) and very poor presentation (stew of something) - NOT their usual appetizing and mouth watering display of food.   When I called to express my dissatisfaction, the answer was I am so sorry ... really?   The bigger they become the less quality they offer and they treat the patrons that they don't know the art of dining and the fact that a family eats together, not one person at a time. Almost similar thing happened last year at the Americana location during dinner hours around X-Mas and I let it go then, but it seems this is becoming a norm for them.

Kira L.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,442,164,2.0,4/11/2017,"I ordered from Cheesecake Factory via Door Dash and was severely disappointed with a wrong delivery order. Who is to blame? I'm not 100% sure, but since the salad was prepared incorrectly, and I was missing key items like the darn DRESSING and salad toppings, I'm leaning towards Cheesecake Factory being in the wrong. I can't imagine Door Dash was in the kitchen making my food... so I hold the restaurant responsible for not including dressing for my Santa Fe salad, and also leaving out the crispy onions and ALSO for not including bread when I specifically requested it.  I called the restaurant for any reparations, and they told me that I needed to contact Door Dash for refunds. Fine, I'll accept my financial reparations from Door Dash, but I still hold the restaurant responsible because making the food properly is YOUR responsibility.  I'm sure people who have ordered delivery can understand the amplified frustration when food doesn't arrive correctly. We wait almost an hour for the food, and when it finally comes... it's not what we ordered. Plus, there's rarely anything we can do to correct the mistake immediately. We just have to be extremely disappointed with our meal for the day.

That being said I have loved this place most of my life. The food is consistent. Nothing spectacular nothing too tragic but today I was here for brunch and my breakfast potatoes were crunchy hard and so greasy I squeezed one and it dropped on the plate. The sad part is that I could tell by looking at it that this was going to happen. That is a simple quality control issue that could have been addressed in the kitchen before it came to the table. I exchanged it for a side salad instead. The disappointing part is that no member of management came to speak with me about it and the potatoes were left sitting on the table for the duration of our meal. It's been years since I've been here, it will probably be years before I come back.

My friend and I had dinner here last night (Tuesday) at 6pm. We got seated right away and our waitress was fast to offer water, bread and take our order. I ordered the almond crusted kale salad from the superfood section. At first I asked for dressing on the side then changed my mind and said just give me the salad as is. My friend ordered the same salad but instead of kale asked for mixed greens. Both of our salads arrive but look completely different aside from the greens. My salad was missing pretty much everything- dressing, avocado, quinoa and cranberries. I asked the waitress if this was how my salad was supposed to be because they looked very different. She told me she would take it back to the kitchen, 10 minutes late I get the corrected salad.  I understand mistakes happen but HOW they get handled says a lot about the restaurant and customer service. I am not going to ask for a discount but I do think a discount or complimentary dessert should have been offered. I just expected a bit more service.

Tarnya M.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",10,1,,1.0,11/21/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to America a number of times now and I always make sure that the Cheesecake Factory is on my list of places to go.  We went to the Cheesecake Factory in a large family group. It was the last night of our holidays and probably the worst night of our holidays. We waited around an hour (which we expected) to be seated. When our server, April, arrived we were lucky to get a smile out of her. We placed our drink orders and I ordered an alcoholic drink - you know being 30 and all. I got asked for ID, which is fine. I provided the server with my Australian drivers licence. She glanced at my licence asked if I had my passport on me, which I told her no. (As a traveller I never carry my passport on my person in case I lose it or something happens). She then told me she can't serve me any alcohol (I don't even think she looked at the ID properly). We tried to explain that our group had been served at the bar before being seated with the same ID's but she still wouldn't serve us. That was that.  We had also tried to order drinks at the bar after she had declined us service (as we had ordered there prior to being seated) but the server had told the bar staff to refuse us service.  The server came back shortly after and said she feels like she didn't explain herself properly before. She then gave a spiel about how it's company policy and she could lose her job (understandable) and that how every so often the staff of Cheesecake Factory come in and do training on international ID's/licenses (which I call bulls**t as she wouldn't serve us on a valid Australian Drivers Licence). Also, we have been to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants and we were served on the exact same ID's.  Now I understand that there is company policy and procedures and there are laws that need to be followed (being in law enforcement myself) but I feel that the way this was handled was very poor. Our group was extremely dissatisfied with the service provided at this particular store. Furthermore, some of the meals were poor quality.  Our group was not happy with the experience at the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove. The server (April) provided poor service from the moment she said hello to the end of our dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=40

My husband was very annoyed & was shocked we didn't have decent service like we always have.  There are a few servers that I usually prefer to be serviced by, but I never know if they are working or not.  We had this waitress before from last night, and the last time we had her she got my order wrong, I had requested no chicken in my pasta, I don't eat red meats, pork, or chicken. So I was bothered by it because the chicken was hidden underneath the pasta, and I had taken few bites of the pasta. I was starving so the second one I devoured.

They have so many options to choose from, that no matter how big your party is, there is definitely something for everyone. From my experience, I try a different dish during each visit and they've never disappointed. Not to mention, their cheesecake is incredible (10/10 would recommend the Red Velvet).  One thing about this location is it is always packed so you'll usually always end up waiting at least 15 minutes for a seat, and on top of that service tends to be a little slow (but they try their best). If you have a lot of time on your hands, and you're looking for a place to hang out with friends, this is the place to be, but if you're in a rush, I would definitely go with somewhere a little quicker.  Side note, if you're a sucker for table bread, you'll LOVE theirs. I could honestly get full off of just the bread itself.  If you want a really good appetizer, go with the avocado egg rolls.

At the top of an escalator I notice another stand identical to the one downstairs but this one had some people crowded around so I waited in line to put down my name for a table. When I got to the host, I told him ""table for two please!"" He stared at me blankly and asked if I had already given my name downstairs. I told him I did not then he frowned and said the wait would have to be about 5-10 minutes. I told him this was fine and moved to the side. My 2 year old daughter and I hung around looking at cheesecakes and about 15 min later they called our number. We returned to the host stand and returned the buzzer. The host told us that they were just cleaning off the table and would seat us shortly. I stepped to the side of the stand to wait to be seated. About another 10 minutes pass and I see several other parties called and also asked to stand to the side. I was pretty close to the stand that the host could have just turned around and told me there was some issue but he didnt. I waited another 5 minutes and went up to ask him if there was a problem. He told me that there was some confusion and that they were getting reorganized. The other two parties that were called and asked to wait were ignored. He could have told them both the same but he did not. Another few minutes pass and another hostess arrives to take us to our seats. As we are walking, she looks at my daughter and myself and asks if I would like a kids menu instead. I notice at this point that the male host who took our name down had handed her two standard menus. Since my daughter is only 2 I found this very strange. She went back and got the correct menu and we were finally seated. I ordered the kids spaghetti with meatballs for my kid and the grilled chicken avocado club for myself. The spaghetti was a large portion, more than she could ever eat, but tasted good. My sandwhich was a monster and impossible to eat without making a mess, but was also very tasty. Our server was a little difficult to find because the one who took our order and the one who checked up on us were not the same. I can only assume that the first one went on break and failed to inform us that the server would be changing. Once I figured out who our server was supposed to be it was a more pleasant experience going forward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=60
Thalie L.,"Chicago, IL",88,294,310,5.0,1/6/2017,I love the cheesecake factory food and I hate that they are called the cheesecake factory because I thing that the meals are better than the desert. I highly recommend the avocado rolls for the sauce! And also their salmon dish is amazing. I also recommend people to share their cheesecake as it is pretty heavy and very rich! What I enjoyed the most was the balcony with view on the grove.

In fact she gave us so much attitude. I have no idea why only Demetrie was kind and considerate. We will not be returning even though Demetrie was outstanding and the food was good.

It was around 8pm and I asked two times how long is my wait time and she ignored me with no eye contact or anything and just spoke to the person next to me who was already getting helped by someone else and she went back to ignoring me. I had to yell out to her in order for her to help me. I felt as though she was Doing racist act towards me and ignoring me because of my color.

Lilia G.,"Goleta, CA",102,7,,1.0,12/3/2017,I chose this place to celebrate my birthday. I knew I was going to have a large party (11 people total). I called them days in advance AND the day off at 10am to let them know that a large party was coming for dinner that day. They didn't take reservations and they said to call back closer to the time to get a more accurate wait time. I called an hour and half before 6:30 pm (on my way to the grove) and I told them my party size and they said they couldn't give me an estimated wait time unless I was there in person. Still holding on to hope because I had never been here but love the grove for it's magical ambiance. I arrive to put my name down and they tell me it's a 3 HOUR WAIT! I was expecting at the most an hour and half (like everyone  else was being told). I KNEW this would happen which is why I called SO MANY times in advance to warn them a large party was coming but they didn't do anything to accommodate and make us wait even longer than everyone else... it absolutely spoiled my birthday filling me with both outrage and sadness because my entire party had travelled to get here only to be expected to wait to eat until 9:30pm. It would have been nice to know on any of the previous phone calls that the wait time could be up to 3 HOURS instead of telling me to be there in person AND then turn away my entire party once they arrived. How does that even make sense?!?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=100
Nancy S.,"Sun City, CA",18,101,176,4.0,10/28/2016,"The restaurant receives a lot of attention from tourists, because it is located in The Grove. The Grove is ""Tourist Trap Central"". I walked the streets and possibly heard English spoken every 20th person. The other 19 spoke a rainbow of languages. I LOVED IT! I have been to this restaurant more times than I can count. However, this go round, I decided to order items I have never ordered before. And, I am VERY glad I did. Do yourself a big favor and check out the Buffalo Blast and Kale Salas appetizers. My husband is a Buffalo Wing aficionado. I took some back home to San Diego, because there were way too many for me to eat. They are the best he has ever had. It eliminates the bones. There is lots of crunch and the flavor is seriously amazing. I am giving it a lesser star, because the hosts clearly put their emphasis on the tourists and ""name brand"" folks. I literally had to say hello to them before they acknowledged my presence (after 2 minutes), which I found humorous. I was dressed extremely casual. I looked very unassuming - possible frugal. However, I am a ""More Than 20% Tipper"" for quality service. Positive Note: Tarin was my server. She was extremely patient and focused on making me happy - from the moment she said hello. She did not concern herself with my appearance, which was due to me spending 5 days in Cedar Sinai Hospital, nursing my son, who is in need of his second heart transplant. So, because of her, the generous cocktail, and the fabulous food, I will definitely go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=100

I ordered the bang shrimp and Cuban egg roll appetizers. The family said it was greasy, the egg rolls but it was ok and the shrimp was good but not a speck of spicy heat but it was good. We also ordered Madera chicken, everything pizza lunch, and Louisiana chicken pasta. The pizza was good. Crispy crust good toppings but it's pizza, even bad pizza is good pizza. The chicken Madera was slightly dry and needed some seasonings but the potatoes and sauce were delicious. Lots of mushrooms. The Louisiana pasta was a bit disappointing. The sauce was thin so it didn't really coat the pasta and the veggies were more like a garnish then part of the dish. It was like crispy chicken and bow tie pasta noodles with veggie garnish. Sad. But, what you really come here for, cheesecake, we ordered strawberry and Apple cheesecake. Both were excellent. Totally worth ordering. We actually enjoyed the strawberry a bit more than the applewhich is surprising for us. The apple had less cheesecake and more filler. The strawberry more cheesecake with just a bit of strawberry on top.  We had a really good waiter, Amanda, who was so awesome and took really good care of us.

The food was on point as always. We got the Chicken Madeira, Thai Lettuce Wrap, Corn Tamales, and Avocado Eggrolls. The Chicken Madeira was tender, juicy, and flavorful without being salty. The lettuce wrap was super fresh and refreshing. The corn tamales were a bit over sauced and drenched in sour cream but they were still good. Avocado eggrolls were like guacamole with wrapping on them.

Entered, and there were quite a few people waiting in the lobby. Put down our name and was told to return in 40 minutes to get a buzzer. This was fine since we wanted to explore The Grove in all its Christmas-ey glory! Returned after 40 minutes, received our buzzer, and was told it was going to be another 20 minutes or so. We decided to wait outside since it was crowded in the lobby. After about a minute, the remote started going off and I assumed they were just starting it up. We go inside anyways and are told to go upstairs!! Score :) We wait just a few more minutes upstairs and then get seated! Our waiter, Jimmy, was great and took good care of us. He had excellent customer service skills and checked on us just enough times.  I ordered the garlic noodles with no meat. It was nice and simple.. just the way I like it. Don't forget to soak the noodles in the sauce every now and then for some more flavor. Had a few bites of the Hibachi steak, which was cooked just right. I also ordered the white sangria.

Normally I don't send my food back, but it was so bad that I had no choice. Second time it came out it was less watery(but still soupy) and still tasteless. (FYI; Had the same dish in Beverly Hills earlier this week, and it was delicious). Sent it back again but this time I didn't wanna take a chance on the same dish, so I got an alternative dish which came out decent. Service wise it sucked. The manager did replace the dish, but it was in a very mechanical way. No apologies, just didn't seem to give a damn. I mean; It's not that I think he should be on his knees,  but at least gave the courtesy to pretend like you care- Specially since you're the manager. The bartender was lagging like crazy when it came to pouring wine, and we had empty glasses for a loooong time. Finally ended up moving to the place next door, where we were taken care of. This review is based on the last visit. With exception of earlier this week, I've in general been very satisfied with both the food and the service at this location.

All I remember is the large and in charge portion sizes that even filled ME UP... So when it was suggested we hit up Cheesecake Factory for lunch, I agreed, with subtle excitement because I wanted to see what the latest was at the chain restaurant.  Well, bring your reading glasses because when you're seated, an ANTHOLOGY is given to you.... Full of delicious sounding fare and photos. Luckily for me, I was very much drawn to the ""Skinnylicious"" menu, thus I only had to read two pages of menu items... That being said, I still struggled to pick what I wanted... The chicken lettuce tacos or the large salad with salmon... I went with the latter because when do I ever crave chicken over salmon?  My dining companion got some chicken dish, the first menu item on page 11, without the mushroom sauce... But for starters, he got a slice of STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE. Clearly he's living the YOLO LIFE. Ha! Everything was up to par however, of course, some of the toppings I wanted included on my salad were taken off (Womp) and the piece of salmon wasn't as big as I was hoping... But oh well, maybe I should start training my stomach to eat smaller portions...? Ahhhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!! When all was said and eaten, we left the Cheesecake Factory bellies full (and a doggy bag for HIM...

I came here because my sister wanted to come here for her birthday, and the birthday girl gets what the birthday girl wants.  First, Wait time is ridiculous, we waited roughly an hour for a table of 4. Then when we were helped we still waited another 15 minutes for them to clean the table and walk us over.  The food here is good, not my personal choice because it is on the heavy side for sure. I guess the cheesecakes are to ""die"" for apparently but I don't have a sweet tooth myself. Everything came out fairly quick I will say which is good.  The staff were helpful and very nice for sure. We asked questions and they were able to answer them confidently.  I would recommend this place to anyone but only if they are not hungry yet and are willing to wait for a long time for a table. This particular location happens to get extra busy so come with plenty of time. The great thing is that there are shops you can go and spend some time while you wait.

Brandon N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/20/2017,"3 Words: Biggest Disappointment Ever. My friends and I went to cheesecake factory thinking we could get some of the ""world's best cheesecake"" as a part of a suprise birthday celebration for one friend in our group who visited from another country. As we finally found a seat to settle for a party of six, we asked the waiter for a 6 inch whole cheesecake and found out that it would take over an hour after request. (Which is a huge delay!) He then gave us time to decide if we would want to make that purchase and decided we would wait, however once he came back, he told us that we may or may not be guaranteed the cheesecake after the 1 hour wait. Because of that, we decided to leave due to the extreme disappointment that this restaurant brought us. First of all, the Cheesecake factory should always have a whole cheesecake ready to go, having every single one frozen is completely ridiculous and only shows how unprepared the restaurant is to take on the demands of its customers. It's called the cheesecake factory for a reason is it not? So how about you stop freezing the cheesecakes during open hours where some customers might want to eat it then and there. Even Marie Callanders has their pies ready to eat upon request for God sakes. Even Vons has whole cheesecakes ready to eat!! The fact that Cheesecake Factory of all places would have all their world famous whole cheesecakes frozen 24/7 is insane! Ready to eat whole cheesecakes should be available upon request!! It's not even debatable for a restaurant looking to satisfy all customers. And for this, they will forever lose a customer. Also, the fact that our cheesecake was ""not guaranteed"" according to the waiter was also completely absurd. The customer should always be placed as a priority and tonight, our group did not recieve the treatment of customer priority.    If I could rate 0/5 stars I would. Cheesecake factory really let us down, and it was embarrassing for us not to have had a whole cheesecake ready for a suprise birthday celebration.

He got us our drinks and we asked him for some bread as we ordered our meals. This is the reason for the 2 star.

We flagged down another server that was walking by and mentioned to her that we requested bread from our server but he never got it. She was nice enough and brought us the bread herself. At this point its been 7 more minutes when she finally got us the bread. We did see our server walk up and down to the table across from us and next to us with bread and drink refills. Finally, another 15 minutes after we got the bread we get our meals. We requested refills on the drinks and more bread (its 3 of us and we're starving) .

I order the lunch size and my husband ordered the full size, the menu clearly says ""marinated chicken"" so I was expecting some kind of marinated chicken. We have ordered this salad at other locations and have notices they add very little chicken, not to say none. By the time the server came back to check on us again, we were almost done with our meals, but when he did we mentioned to him the chicken issue and he did in fact apologize (that is why I did 2 stars even though the chicken is not his fault but he did apologize) he  offer to bring us some chicken on the side or change our meals. We opted for chicken on the side for the salads. Will probably keep coming to Cheesecake since we do like their food but they need to work a little more on customer service and quality control.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=220

That aside the staff always has a smile and give you a buzzer so when your table is ready you can come. its has a good distance so that you can at least can shop some. Its hard to explain what to get here, if you never been then you need to come. The menu is a size of a large book. lots of things and they do brunch too with a different menu. Great drink menu lots of fruity drinks  Free bread and butter two kinds :) I love the skinny menu and come here for lunch all the time. I get the grilled chicken with pasta  I always get the food the way i requested.  Now for dessert. The cheesecake is good. Lots of different flavors and they always have a seasonal flavor.

Emily A.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/13/2017,"Worst service of my life. When we first arrived, we waited easily forty five minutes for our buzzer to go off (we were told it would be less than twenty minutes). When we stood to be seated, we were told the table wasn't ready yet and they'd call us by name. When we FINALLY got seated after being there over an hour, we didn't see a waiter for almost thirty minutes. By the time he got there, we already knew what we wanted and asked for water please and then ordered the rest of our meal and dessert. The waiter was once again nowhere to be seen for yet another twenty minutes (so, to recap, we had been in the building almost two hours, seated for nearly an hour, and hadn't even seen a glass of water). He finally arrives with water and what we had ordered for dessert, without bringing out bread or our appetizers or our entree. We asked for the check early. We didn't touch dessert as we wanted our other food first, we finished both our waters with no refill for over forty minutes, and after yet another twenty minutes he brings out a basket of bread and a check. (My partner and I had started timing these rare visits as a betting game, it had gotten so bad.) It would be a while longer on our appetizer, he said. Could we wait another thirty minutes? At this point I could've laughed. We canceled the remainder of our order, paid for our cheesecake and left.  So, we had been seated nearly two hours before we got our bread basket. Nearly an hour before we got a glass of water and forty minutes for a refill. We had been in the building nearly three hours before being told we'd have to wait longer for even our appetizer. As we didn't want to be eating mediocre pasta when the sun came up, we had to leave early. I've worked in food service before. I've worked busy nights and have dealt with being understaffed, fussy customers, the lot. They were not understaffed, it wasn't particularly busy, and from what we could observe many tables in our section were barely ever checked on, many had finished drinks and long finished their bread or food and were simply waiting for someone to swing by.  We will absolutely not be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=220

Rylle R.,"Temecula, CA",88,2,,3.0,1/6/2018,"Like most Cheesecake Factories I've been to, the food has always been good. However, I would suggest to never go on a busy night.  A 2 hour wait is not great, but you have the rest of the mall to explore in that time. We were seated on the balcony with the theater lobby in view. It was a nice atmosphere but then I sat down and my feet were greeted with a wet syrupy floor. I look down and find that the entire floor has been neglected, cluttered with spills and stray food. Not something I want in any restaurant or my own home. A dirty restaurant is something I can't stand. The service is decent. The servers were very nice and food was served in about 10-20m of ordering. However, you can tell its a busy night when you notice that the pasta you ordered was slightly undercooked. It was also a little bit colder in temperature than you would want to eat it at. Then you would see under a light, the large smear that was meant to clean the edges of the plate. It should have been clean, but it was a clearly visible tomato smear.  As the table beside us finished eating and the clean up crew came around, I really hoped they would clean the floor. Unfortunately they didn't and it bothered me quite a bit. I wouldn't want to tell someone else to do their job when I'm a customer, so no words left my mouth.  TL;DR The cheesecake and food was good at least. Never go on a busy day, or you will face the quality of food and cleanliness of the restaurant lacking.

Boyfriend and I came here for a dinner date. The wait to be seated for dinner around 7:45 pm was 45 minutes, so we decided to go to the bar and find self seating. Once seated, it took a good 10 minutes for a server to notice us and to clean the table from the previous people. We got our menu's and ordered fairly quickly but, we did not receive utensils, appetizer plates, or the complimentary bread that they typically hand out once you've been greeted. We had to ask for them ourselves after aimlessly waiting for a good 7 minutes. We also ordered drinks but, those did not come out for over 25 minutes. I understood they were busy, but that does not give them an excuse when I've been to much busier restaurants and have received better service. The food came out shortly after which was great, but our server NEVER came up to ask if we needed anything else or how the food was. We ate for a good 30 minutes without any contact. We even had to wave our server down to look at a desert menu and order. Those occurred on two separate occasions too. We almost just gave up on ordering dessert but, my boyfriend never had a cheesecake from here so I wanted him to try one obviously cos they are good. But, OMG, you do NOT even want me to get started on how terrible it was to get our check. It took forever to find our sever to ask for our check.

The staff here is a little rude and some of them are impatient and seem like they just hate their jobs. We were seated on the balcony and it was a pretty hot day so it was uncomfortable and crowded. Our waitress seemed a little off and was not very attentive. And for some reason I always feel like these restaurants are a little dirty! We ordered peach bellinis which were too sweet and tasted like they had zero alcohol. They also took forever to come out. The food was just very bland and not good. I decided to order the fish tacos and they were a little cold when they arrived to the table. The fish was not crispy and a little soggy. They just seemed flavorless. The only reason I gave this place another chance was because I was given a gift card. Do yourself a favor and try one of the other thousand restaurants in the area.

Also, there is an elevator off to the left hand side if you would like to go that route.  We just came here for a few drinks and dessert so we sat at the bar. Nice low lighting ambiance and the service was great! Francisco was our server for the night.  He was attentive and made sure to get our drinks and desserts to us in a timely manner. I ordered the strawberry daiquiri and the White chocolate raspberry cheesecake to go along with it. Loved the drink! Tasted great and was made super quick.  The cheesecake was perfect. It wasn't too rich, the white chocolate didn't overpower the entire cheesecake so it was the perfect amount of sweet. Paired with my drink it was delicious!

Ambiance here is always on point, with decent service.  I have been coming here since the golden days, and it has not been long since I discovered their chicken and shrimp gumbo. Perhaps it's my favorite dish of all time here which I highly recommend. Their sauce is absolutely delicious, words cannot describe how awesome it tastes. Their chicken is tender, shrimp is gorgeous, and it all goes great with perfectly steamed white or brown rice. Their steak Diane, and BBQ ribs are also great alternatives depending on your mood. Their nachos are awesome too for sharing. Ask for ranch sauce so you can dip their wheat bread in it. Try not to finish it or you will be too full by the time the main dish arrives.

Once our buzzer was rang, we were instructed to go to the restaurant upstairs and check in at the left. We were seated in a booth but please note that this location is LOUD with echoes so it's very hard to hear and worse if your server can't hear you - because she didn't hear me ask for the additional $3.50 chicken in my super antioxidant salad. I wasn't mad, just not full!  The $10.95 antioxidant salad itself is mostly leaves and and broccoli. I think I counted three pieces of avocado and very little of anything else that was advertised on the menu (pears, grapes, blueberries, etc). I left disappointed with this choice, unfortunately.  The rest of my party seemed satisfied: the club (first we were under the impression it came with fries but does not), classic burger, BBQ Ranch chicken salad and chicken Thai coconut lime chicken seemed to be great.

Anna N.,"Pasadena, CA",48,202,128,2.0,10/9/2017,"It must have been over a decade since I've eaten at a Cheesecake Factory. I wanted to visit a pop up shop at The Grove (first time at The Grove, shopping plazas and places where everyone wants to go all at once in general are not really my thing although I could be describing all of LA save for a few precious square feet) and my friend wanted to eat here. It was a 25 minute wait for a table of two and we considered and later regretted just not walking one block to the Farmer's Market at The Grove.  My first impression of this place is that it's ""like a theme park restaurant"" - and my friend pointed out how a line on the escalator to the second floor looked like people were in fact on a ride. Macaroni Grill is comparable food wise but just does such a much better job with food and ambience. After 25 minutes of waiting people ride the escalator to wait 10-15 more minutes.  The low ratings is primarily due to the drink menu coupled with the greasiness of the tables and floors. I felt like I was eating somewhere in Chinatown where at least it's remotely acceptable and part of the atmosphere. But the light brown tables really brought out the greasy look. Walking to the restroom was greasy. I was wearing mule flats with a reliable bottom tread and the floor was greasy enough to make the trip to the restroom a bit precarious in terms of slippage potential and felt my step slide at least twice. I hate greasy places. The ""blood orange margarita"" was a joke that went unfinished. Wrong taste, wrong glass. Avoid their cocktails at all costs and just go for draft beer or wine.  Their food was the only good thing - their infamous brown bread and butter. I had the jambalaya pasta and it was scientifically perfect. Their food undeniably has the taste of several food scientists sweating over recipes and testing them before putting it onto their ever changing menu. That's really the only interesting thing about this place. I compare it to McDonald's and use the same term: ""eatability."" The food has high eatability - you can eat a lot of their huge portions before being sated and even when sated want to eat just a bit more. It isn't necessarily the best food by all standards but boy is it so...eatable. And I don't mean edible...eatable foods are foods that create their own standard rather than adhere to traditional standards and emphasize the most base human cravings and turn those up a notch. The balance of color, of ingredients, of texture, of ease of transporting food from plate to mouth and the art of shape/portioning - it is all down to a measured science and I gotta say that in itself is pretty respectable and fascinating. Eatability is all about being too good to be authentic. That said, I probably will never come back even if there is a time and place for eatable foods.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3

I even came here for dinner at 8PM on a Tuesday night one time and it was still busy; we had to take a buzzer and wait 30 minutes before we could get a table. I recently came here for lunch with a colleague and made a reservation to avoid the 30 minute wait but we still had to wait 10 minutes upstairs to be seated. I debated about giving my review 4 stars, but the consistently long wait times here annoy me so much that I couldn't do it. I've had pretty good, attentive servers here though. No complains about the service. Expect at least a 20 minute wait for food... The last time I was here, we had to wait way longer than that for our food though which was annoying. I love the food and drinks here; it's generally on par. The only time I didn't enjoy the food was the time I ordered a Classic Burger; it tasted so bland that I could only eat a quarter of it.

We tried the Thai lettuce wraps and highly recommend them as an appetizer. My only issue with this location, or in general The Grove as a whole, is that people are so adamant about bringing their pets into restaurant and retail stores. Why does your dog need to be present in these locations? Some lady had her dog who kept barking at customers and servers walking by.

It was already getting late, so we made our decisions quickly and we're ready to order promptly. She brought us our drinks before we even got to tell her what we wanted as an appetizer. She was in a hurry to leave us. We shouted after her as she tried to ignore us. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms to start and again she proceeded to walk away even though we weren't finished. We waited another 30 min for the stuffed mushrooms to come out, which came out so cold they might as well have had icicles hanging from them! We were disgusted and outraged. We tried looking for our server. We even asked the manager to look for her. Our request was ignored... Finally we got her attention. We told her the stuffed mushrooms were cold. All she said was ""do you want a new order?"" We refused! No apology what so ever. At this point our jaws were basically on the floor. We were beyond outraged. Our experience only continued to get worse. The take out order we requested had no sauce what so ever. There was not a drop of sauce in sight. It was was supposed to be a bow tie pasta with white wine sauce. It was so dry I felt like I needed to go to the hospital for dehydration but I'm Canadian and don't have insurance.

The Grubbin' M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",205,32,10,5.0,8/10/2016,"Sorry for not writing this review sooner. It has been two weeks since my visit to this location for the first time. I didn't like the hostesses downstairs. I patiently waited in line to put my name down on the list. People behind me in line stepped to the left and right of me, to be taken by the next hostess and have their name put down. At least 3 groups cut in front of me. Until I finally interrupted all the stimulation that seemed to be distracting the hostesses (the natural atmosphere of Cheesecake Factory) and said ""HEY! Aren't I next in line?"" She said, ""...yes."" And could not understand my firm statement. I said, if you see someone next in line, call them over. Don't just take the next person who walks up. Obvious a line had formed. Be fair to those waiting. I can be pushy too and cut the line, but don't think you hostesses would want people crowded around the counter in a disorganized fashion.  One hostess (young black girl with braids) was one I had contact with. She was unaware of what was happening. She apologized and put my name down, and apologized one other time later. I appreciate this, but please, take more notice of those who are patiently waiting to receive a pager. Just because I came in alone, does not mean I am not important, because that's how I felt... On a side note, I found a place at the bar, and my server was Kennedy. Gosh is she awesome. She was attentive and sincere in the way she engaged with you in conversation. She patiently answered ALLLL my menu questions and was knowledgeable about everything. I would go back to Cheesecake just because of her. Servers should emulate the style that Kennedy puts out there. She is kind, caters to your needs and is helpful. She offered to box my food for me, which many Cheesecake servers don't do. She checked on me enough. I didn't have to grab her attention much, if at all.  Thank you Kennedy, for making my solo dinner just days before my bday, a memorable one. Honestly.  I hope you get some recognition at work for your exemplary work ethic.  Keep doing you! Lastly, I can't forget Cindy. I hope I spelt her name right (or maybe it's Cindi)?  You were an absolute gem. U offered me a pleasant memory with your friendly and genuine chat. Thank you for your confirmation on my cheesecake selection.  You were very generous with your final gesture.

I could get a steak just as bad at Denny's), I am not happy with my service I received today. We sat on the patio which is nice because it's not as loud as inside the restaurant which is always insanely loud. We waited for over an hour to be seated and it was NOT worth the wait. The server when taking our order didn't even let us finish ordering before he proceeded to walk off waving at us in dismissal. No exaggeration. He actually waved us off and began to walk away WHILE we where trying to order! Flipping Rude! I asked for bread and it wasn't even brought to the table until our meal was finished. I was taking my last bite when it arrived. I think we wouldn't have even received it had our servers not been switched. I found his treatment to be extremely rude and inattentive. I ordered a soda but it was empty throughout my meal. The shrimp was bland and tasted old. It was mushy and Luke warm. To make matters worse, when we got home I looked at my Godiva brownie I ordered to go, there was no fudge, no whipped cream, no chocolate candy garnish. Just 3 dry brownie wedges. This is what upsets me the most. Why the hell did I pay almost $100.00 to be disrespected, ignored and treated like an inconvenience and then get a F.U.B.A.R. Dessert? I'm going to Marina Delray from now on. The food has always been good at that location and I've never been treated poorly there. I'm going to have to say goodbye to the Grove location from now on.

Guy G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,88,7,3.0,4/7/2016,This is for the Grove location only. The good: Pizza and salad were excellent. It was open late. The view from the patio was pretty nice. The price was ok. The bad: The staff. The host tries to be cheerful but makes odd jokes about peoples names. The server was cranky and nit picky taking orders. The food runner ignores several calls pretending not to hear them. The bread basket has gotten a lot smaller. I think the staff at the new Santa Monica location is a lot nicer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=260
Annie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,3,,5.0,12/9/2016,"I remember last year in September 20 my family and a few of my cousins we all went to eat in Cheesecake Factory. When we went inside the restaurant I was like oh my god!!! It was a big restaurant and super fancy at that with a lot of customers  The service was really good. The workers were friendly people and not rude at all to every customers. In the restaurant the customers were also really friendly and everyone was enjoying their food.  There was many good food in the restaurant. All the selection of food that they had looked delicious. The price looked expensive but in the plate they gave you a lot of food and the plate wasn't a small one it was a big plate. I remember that i ordered a chicken shrimp soup and it was the best soup I ever had in my life. I just wish that i would have gotten more shrimp than chicken. My brother ordered some nachos and it came with A LOT of cheese and meat. It was a huge plate in my opinion. After we finished eating we all ordered cheesecakes. I order a new York style cheesecake. It was super delicious. My cousin ordered a double cheese burger or some type of burger but damn it was really big and with the mouth of cheese it had i think it look like a juicy burger. I would recommend this to all my friends especially one of my close friend Maricruz because I am pretty positive that she will love it, she loves cheesecake and i would say hey i found the best cheesecake ever and you should try it in Cheesecake Factory it is worth it!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=260

I know of no one who can stomach 1 spoon of raw minced garlic and still taste their meal enough to enjoy it....I'm included, since I was unable to stop tasting garlic after downing my previous drink, and trying to nibble on anything else.....

The menu is insane, way too much really, but usually everything that comes out is pretty good. One of the better chains when it comes to quality, prices are a bit higher, but portions are large and you can easily have left overs for later making the price justified.

Ryan C.,"San Francisco, CA",385,70,62,5.0,11/17/2015,"First time I've been to this location, and it was an amazing experience. First of all, there was a ridiculously long wait (more than a 2 hour wait) for a table, so I decided to just ask them if me and my friend can order takeout instead. Even thought they were jam packed, they were kind enough to let us in and order upstairs. When we got there, the display of cheesecakes was unimaginable. It was like walking into a bakery filled with your favorite cakes (mine being cheesecake). We were going to order, but we decided to try to ask if there were any bar seatings open. To our surprise, they told us that it was open seating and we were free to grab any open seat. We were shocked when we walked over and found two open seats!!! It was too great, bypassing maybe about 30 parties and getting to sit down at the bar and order. The ambiance is absolutely terrific. Though slightly dark, it highlights the collection of liquor at the bar, along with the Christmas lighting outside on the main street (if you come during the holiday season). If you want to save room for dessert, I would recommend just ordering appetizers, which in my opinion, are better than their main courses. I got the loaded baked tater tots and buffalo chicken wings. The chicken wings were average, wasn't bad, but didn't stand out. However, their loaded baked tater tots were out of this world. Perfectly fried tater tots with cheese, bacon, and green onions, with sour cream to dip on the side. Oh man it couldn't have been anymore perfect. Once you bite past the perfectly fried outer layer, the inside just melts in your mouth and you taste a creamy combination of cheese, potato, bacon, and green onions. And this appetizer is only $6 for about 10 of them. Definitely worth getting it.  As for the desert, I tried the tuxedo cheesecake, recommended to me by my friend. And boy it did not disappoint. If you love chocolate, or anything sweet, get ready to taste chocolate on top of cheesecake on top of chocolate on top of more chocolate. Comprised of their fudge cake, chocolate cheesecake, mousse, and more chocolate, this cheesecake makes you feel like your mouth is swimming in chocolate (along with the two giant creamy, delicious mounds of whipped cream they top it with).  This experience here couldn't have been any better. To those with a party of 2 or 3, try the bar if the restaurant is too crowded. If not, it's still definitely worth the experience, especially if you can get a seat outside on their beautiful balcony overlooking the Grove's heavily decorated and beautiful main street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=300

Tim L.,"Los Angeles, CA",322,164,242,3.0,9/29/2016,Simple and Sweet Cheesecake factory is definitely a great place to go celebrate in big parties or when you have a lot of friends with different needs. Cheesecake factory can deliver as they have a massive menu that WILL cater to everyone. The food is alright but its the portions and the free bread that makes up for everything. You will definitely end up with leftovers because of how giant each dish is. I always get the Jambalaya pasta because that's my go to item. Of course they are known for their cheesecakes and their cheesecakes are super decadent but oh so delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them as all the ones i've tried are really good.  I think for this location service can be average as other yelpers have mentioned but its not bad. The decor is solid at every location and this one is no exception. Heck this one is 2 stories and you take a escalator up to the dining room! How awesome is that?!  Definitely a great place to celebrate in big parties and get together. Prices are also extremely fair so thumbs up!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=120

The salad was ordered without cheese and it came with cheese. The veggie burger was completely cold and the Fries felt like it was cooked back in 2016. Overall the services was terrible because the manager made us wait more for them to bring out the new order and didn't even take of a cheesecake bill.

So I am not slamming them as I am a realist. But this visit was the most subpar ever for their standards. If you read my reviews I like them and review them as such.  On 12/30/16 I went and there was a 15 minute wait but the ladies at the front desk were very nice and accurate about wait time. Once our buzzer went off we went upstairs and we're seated. Now here is where the fun began. We entered CKF at 12:57p, were seated at 1:12pm, but was not asked about drinks or anything until 1:35p. They were busy, and our waitress had multiple tables and I could tell she was doing her best, but we did not leave until 3:04p because everything took forever.  We just wanted to pay because our Gumbo was just plain nasty (this time, normally it is to die for), but that still took 30 minutes. The people serving us tried their best but they were clearly short staffed, and we always thank the great state of California for giving 18-22 year old millennials the option to go to work or simply call in and be paid (pretty sure if they had it when I was growing up I would us every hour I had lol).

Once we where called in to be seated the hostess gave our table to another party so we where ask to wait additional time. We waited 15 additional minutes and where told that our table was ready. As we went in to be seated they tried to seat us inside, we said ""no, we want a table in the patio"". We where told we would have to wait some time for a table in he patio.

Julie B.,"Cerritos, CA",402,384,1877,2.0,2/26/2015,"I normally have good experiences at The Cheesecake Factory, but sadly our visit to TCF last Friday left a lot to be desired. We arrived right at 6pm with a party of 4 and were told the wait would be 15 mins. After 25 mins had passed we started getting a little antsy. Waited until the 30 min mark and went up to the hostess to find out how much longer we'd have to wait. When I handed them my number, the hostess looked on her computer, made an obvious ""oops"" face and said we should go upstairs to be seated. It was completely obvious that they had forgotten to text us although our table had been ready for a while. When I pressed them asking why we hadn't received a text, they rudely said ""we tried texting you but no one came up"".  Such a blatant lie as there were zero texts received. And how shady is it to try and blame the customer? I would have pushed it further, but we were with out of town guests and I didn't want to make them uncomfortable. Their unwillingness to admit the mistake and own up to it left me more than a little irritated. The meal itself was ok. Our main waitress was very nice and came by frequently to check on us. One of the random servers who delivered part of our meal was rude and barked ""who had the pasta"" when she had to repeat herself (uh, our guests didn't speak English, lady. Sheesh). Overall, our party enjoyed the food/wine/cheesecake. The low 2 star rating is solely for the irresponsible and rude service we received. I will avoid coming to this particular TCF location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=320

Destiny A.,"South Gate, CA",0,9,3,1.0,1/10/2017,"Went out a couple nights ago with my boyfriend to the grove and we originally were going to go to a different restaurant but decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory since our first visit was so good. We got there and the wait was thirty minutes but it felt like we were seated a bit sooner (which was nice) they say us outside near the edge squashed up next to a bigger party. They do have heaters but where they sat us the heaters did not reach...mind you this was at night so it was freezing! Most places would let you know ahead of time or ask if it's fine that you'd be outside. Nope! They assumed since we were young that we weren't going to spend much so we essentially didn't matter(we felt pretty judged) but they sat us inside and our server finally came. He spoke very low so it was hard to hear and we continuously asked him to repeat what he said. We knew what we wanted when he asked for our drinks so our orders were placed quickly. A couple next to us we're seated at the same time. This was an older and more rich looking couple...not only did they get their drinks, bread and butter before us but they also got their meal before us even though it was put in after us. We asked a few times what was taking so long and he just stared confused. Once the couple finished their food, paid, and another couple came, got their orders taken and served!!! We were served. I was so mad and so hungry. Ps my boyfriend got a burger and fries while I was served cold mashed potatoes and chicken. WORST SERVICE EVER!

We had to tip  the waiter was so patient and I'm sure could tell I was embarrassed. Needless to say we don't go out with his family anymore.

I work at the Grove so I order fairly regularly from this location.  I love this restaurant chain and they have delicious food, but this particular location seems to have issues when you place an order to go. More times than not, my to go order is missing something that wouldn't be missing from a dine in customer. My particular issue is when I order the Factory Nachos. On past occasions, I've added chicken and not received it or it's been something simple like they forgot the guacamole and sour cream; which is a special order for the nachos! They come standard! I haven't order the nachos in a while because of my poor luck with that particular item,  but I gave it another shot tonight. And, not surprising, they forgot the sour cream and guacamole.  I have always been taken care of when I have brought my complaint about missing items from my orders, but the frequency in which I have to do this is too often.  My advice would be to check your orders BEFORE leaving the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=320

I would've been fine with a slight pink center but this was medium at best. Basically I got half of a burger, a few fries and a soda for $23.

We ordered two items from their lunch menu which were the pizza and salad combo, and the pasta. They were considered ""smaller/lunch"" portions but I honestly felt they were pretty big already. The pizza was great! Salad was good, we ordered the Cesar salad with cheese and dressing on the side. I also ordered a fettuccine Alfredo in which you can add chicken to, but I passed and tried it by itself. It was sooo filling but it was good, thick, creamy!

Aryo S.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",420,233,778,4.0,11/29/2016,"---Atmosphere, Service, Parking---- Located at The Grove you can expect this to be a busy place. With the same look and feel of other locations elsewhere, it's a great setting with a couple differences. They do have a patio with what I suspect to be a nice view. When you enter there's a host stand with several hosts, and they'll take your name down and present you with a pager (if you have to wait). The cool thing is that the pager allows you to walk to a certain distance, so ask about how far it reaches the surrounding area. Once entering you'll head up a set of stairs or escalators and then you need to talk to another set of hosts who then ultimately seat you. Nearby is a display with desserts and dressings for sale.  Service was pretty great by newcomer(at the time) Asia when I visited last and besides one bump in the road with hosts prior to sitting down, everything else went well.  The Grove has parking and it's in a large parking structure. Make to sure to ask about validation as they validate an hour here (first at The Grove is free).  --Food, Drinks & Prices--- I'm sure you know what they provide here and at the many other locations; the menu is vast with all sorts of things. Many appetizers, small plates, pasta dishes, pizzas, burgers and sandwiches, soups and salads, tacos, chicken and steak dishes, seafood, and all other sorts of entrees, ranging and hitting many flavors of different cuisines. Portions are large and same with the calories in everything (don't look!). Love the fresh bread and butter they serve first. I've pretty much loved everything I've had at the Factory over the years, can't go wrong with anything really. Here's a few things I've tried: -Avocado Eggrolls - Avocado lovers unite! Tons of it obviously with a couple other ingredients mixed in served with a tamarind dipping sauce. -Tex-Mex Eggrolls - Crispy rolls filled w/spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and melted cheese. Served with avocado cream and a pica de gallo. -Buffalo Bites - Lots of breading on this thing but for those who love buffalo sauce these are filled with chicken, cheese and wing sauce. -Crab Cakes - Three of them I believe and pretty tasty. -Meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread - Great meatballs and sauce, served with great bread for dipping -Chicken Scampi Pasta - All the great flavors of a scampi, delicious. -Steak Diane - Medallions of certified angus beef steak covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and grilled onions. Great! -Pumpkin Cheesecake - If you like pumpkin pie you'll adore this just the same. All sorts of drinks and a full bar is available. Something to note is that The Factory has it's own line of wine, I believe beer as well (I may be wrong on that). Prices are in the $5-20ish range.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=140

That being said, I decided to order from them again today, though I was uncertain about it.  Two more salads came out without meat on them, and because the person who filled my bags assured me they were made correctly, I didn't notice until I had walked back over with our food.  I could understand checking food to make sure it has no cheese on it, etc. as part of a specification, and I'm also not the type to leave bad reviews, but this is really unacceptable and reflects badly on me as an employee when my execs notice something's wrong.

I went to cheesecake with my bf and his mom. All three of us got pasta. My bf and I ordered the jambalaya and for one of them we asked for EXTRA sauce on the side. I repeated this to our server and he even confirmed it. HOWEVER, when it came out they did not put any sauce on it!!! AND no sauce on the side either...ummm...so you expect me to eat a tasteless jambalaya? I would understand if they at least gave me sauce on the side so I know where the miscommunication was but they put no sauce on the jambalaya AND no sauce on the side, just plain noodles. The jambalaya sauce took a very long time to come out, maybe around 20 minutes. By the time the sauce came out my bf and his mom were done eating. To top that off, my noodles had become cold! Ohmygosh...I'm a pretty understanding and patient person but this is unacceptable! As I was eating my cold jambalaya, my bf and his mom were watching me eating because they were already done...awkward. Even after this HUGE mistake, they did not offer any discounts. I'm not one to ask for discounts but the gesture tells you that they really are apologetic. All we got is a 'sorry' and nothing else. I used to work at a restaurant too and if something like this happened, I would go to the manager and explain what happened and see if I can do anything to make it up. Super disappointed! Especially since Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain restaurant.  I have more bad experiences at cheesecake but this review is already super long.

It made me never want to come back to this location.   First the waiting was kinda long but I didn't mind the lady at the front desk was kinda rude when I had asked where the Nike store was. She had a little bit of an attitude as if I knew where it was  They sat us next to where the they enter everybody's orders and they all talk to each other we heard about the drama and there personal life's (problems)   . It took them about 20 minutes to get our drinks ,  and they didn't bring all our drinks at once , it took an additional 5 minutes for my lemonade to come out , then they placed our order, by that time we have watched a few people come in and out by the time we even got our food .. We both ordered a pasta dishes with no special request or anything like that .. we waited an additional 30-45 minutes just for our food. The food seemed like it was rushed and there was really no flavor .. so finally we asked for the bill which took about 15 minutes to get. We know it wasn't all the waiters fault because we watched some other waiters keep giving him request to help them out so we tried be as chill as possible and understanding .

The restaurant is extremely impressive, two storeys high with gorgeous cathedral ceilings in the marbled lobby and the option of stairs, elevator or escalator to get from the waiting/hostess area to the restaurant level.  The Grove is a busy place, especially on a weekend so if you are looking to come here for lunch you'll need to be prepared to wait for a table, anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour depending on the time of day you turn up- they do not take reservations. I've never had a problem with the wait time although on one occasion I visited they managed to lose our reservation during the minute it took for myself and friend to ascend the stairs, it wasn't a busy evening though so it wasn't a problem. The service can vary, depending on time of day although the wait staff are generally very friendly and helpful. Because this place is so busy their attentiveness can be hit and miss which can be irritating if you're extremely hungry. If you aren't sure what to order you can always rely on your server to give you a great recommendation!  Speaking of food... HOLY MENU! It is crazy how many items are on offer. Everything is delicious but I highly recommend the following: Ahi Tuna Carpaccio (very healthy for all you gym nuts like myself) Asian Lettuce Cups (Though the lettuce is kind of hard to wrap the contents in because of the leaf shape of the type they use) Hangar Steak (Medium Rare for best outcome) I also love their Glam Burgers and Sweet Potato Fries. You definitely need to hook yourself up with a Cheesecake before you leave, the Oreo Dream and Godiva are to die for but also very, very rich.

Jackie K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",234,21,6,1.0,1/27/2016,"We had a terrible experience. We came there on a Tuesday night for my daughters 9th birthday.  The waiter held a tray full of drinks, including coffee, virgin daquiries, lemonade, and water, over my daughters head.  When she moved in her chair, he spilled the contents of the tray all over my child and into my purse and coat and me.  We were soaked.  My daughter was crying and sticky.  The waiter did not get a manager (the restaurant was so busy that it was hard to get any help). Instead he refused to even assist me with drying my coat and purse, and told me that there was nothing he could do about it.  He brought towels and wiped up the floor.  My daughter was a wet wreck.  She was sticky and her spirits were soured.  Despite the fact that my purse was swimming with water with the contents ruined, I attempted to bring up the mood so as to help my daughter forget the unpleasantness.  At the end of the meal... no one was around to help.  I tried to wave down assistance for 20 minutes... the evening was getting late.  I got up to leave with my family when finally a check was brought to me.  They not only charged me for everything, there were even additional drinks added to the list that were not ordered. I was in a hurry to leave, and I didn't want to get my daughter upset by arguing, so I quickly paid the check and even added the standard gratuity. When I called the next day regarding what happened so that my dry cleaning would be covered, they kept me on hold for 15 minutes before some manager named Cindy said ""that's not what my waiter told me""  and that ""no one heard a child cry"" and that ""you could have called a manager"" Avoid this place. The staff are only superficially nice, but deep down they hate their customers Who would pour a tray of drinks on people and then not pick up their dry cleaning bills.

I have a major allergy issue, and we visited back in March. I ordered and specifically told the server 3 times to make the proper changes. I always get the same thing at other locations and they can accommodate. This server tried to have me to try something else instead, then went and checked with the back and came back to confirm they can do it. The food server (different person) even repeated the food order and the customization to me. After eating it, I started feeling ill. I asked the server again about the custom food and he said that's what you ordered. After a couple of more bites, I realized they were wrong and it was not customized. So the manager finally came over and confirmed it wasn't. He offered to pay for the meal of $40 which had no meaning for me and what I went thru that night. Thankfully it wasn't a hospital visit but still a painful night with no sleep. The manager even asked me for my name and number so he can check on me the next day. Guess what, no call. Probably thought I was a dine and dasher. I have been going to cheesecake since I was in my teens. Now it's just not something I will refer people to or go myself.

The burger was great, but if you're looking for something somewhat healthy go for something else. I felt like I gained 10 lbs after eating the BBQ burger. Probably didn't help that I had a side of ranch to dip my fries in.  The service was great. Our ice teas and water were filled without having to ask our waiter. We sat outside and it was a beautiful day.  I've also been here several other times. The fried calamari is a must try, as well as the eggplant Parmesan. During dinner time it gets very busy. I've waited as long as an hour before. The good thing is they will send you a text when the table is ready so you don't have to wait around. Go shop and come back when you get the text. The grove has an hour of free parking, which means you'll end up paying if there's a slight wait or you plan on taking your time. I really enjoy this location.

By the time we were seated, it was almost 10:00 PM.  Everyone was fading, and just seeking a slice of dessert and a beverage in a reasonable time frame. Instead, it was noisy, crowded, and though the servers were rocking and rolling, it was hard to get decent service. Everything at this location appears larger than life - the interior design is on a grand scale, the  second floor feels like being 3 or 4 stories high in the air.  The portions are big and expensive, to boot. By the time we were able to order and be served, it was late, late, late.  It just felt over the top on so many levels.  Was very happy to get out of there and back down to street level, which was blissfully quiet at the hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=180
Derek L.,"San Jose, CA",140,216,708,2.0,8/5/2016,"This is more of a review regarding the layout they have here, which is just completely nonsensical. Why the heck do they have two check in stations that seem to operate separately?! When you walk in the door downstairs, you check in at the host stand. They tell you when you can go upstairs, presumably because your table is ready and someone will seat you upstairs. Well, tough luck. We went upstairs as instructed, no one helped us or greeted us upstairs so we walked around til we found a waiter and asked if we could just grab a table, since there were plenty at this hour. He told us to go back to the host stand, where the hostess was more interested in gossiping with her friend than she was in providing customer service. She made sure she finished her conversation before she attended to my party and the other parties waiting, with lots of attitude, mind you. Outrageous. I just don't understand what the point of checking in downstairs is if you have to check in again upstairs. Like logically, for crowd control purposes, you should check in downstairs, and then have the party go upstairs when someone upstairs is ready to seat you. Seamless process right? THe way they have it set up, upstairs is a total fire hazard. You have people waiting to be seated, and probably confused why no one is helping them. You have people oogling at the cheesecake displays. And you have people trying to exit the restaurant too. Three way traffic in a tiny hundred square foot radius.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=180

They have a special menu with drinks and full sized appetizers for $5.50. It's only in the bar area so it can get crowded, we were able to get two tall boy tables in the bar area and we had 9 people in our group. Our waiter (sorry can't remember his name) was wonderful! Very accommodating and helpful. We probably ordered 1-2 of everything on the happy hour menu, I had a few Long Island iced teas, which were not in the least bit strong, but that's expected for $5.50. We had unlimited bread and butter and the place can get a little loud, but overall, I would go back because it was a fun get together for us.

Christina C.,"New York, NY",431,203,421,1.0,7/27/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. I've always loved eating at this chain restaurant ever since in junior high. My go-to dish is the Pasta Da Vinci, and after 10+ years, I always still crave it every time I walk past a Cheesecake Factory. There is a location near my office, so I decided to grab the pasta dish as take out. HUGE mistake ordering from here as this place is in the Grove.. which basically equals super packed and full of tourists. When I got back to my apartment, I noticed my food was barely lukewarm and watery. The dish barely had a taste (and the little taste it did have.. was pretty funky) and did not taste ANYTHING like the other times I've gotten the Pasta Da Vinci. There was also pieces of pasta that did not belong. The dish comes with penne, but there were random pieces of farfalle and other types of pasta. I also found a couple pieces of sausage that obviously should not be there.... since this dish does not come with sausages... makes me wonder how they cook the food... Thanks to this location, I don't think I'll ever want to go to another Cheesecake Factory again. So thanks for ruining that for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=180

She is only one and loved it. My friend and I shared the vegan Cobb salad and a pasta. I enjoyed the Vegan Cobb. It had fruit on it but I thought that was slightly strange but the quinoa addition was very nice. We ordered Santa Fe Egg Rolls also, if you have these make sure you use the dipping sauce and eat some rice noodles which are really a garnish but we enjoyed.

It turned out to be a perfect Sunday night dinner with friends. Even though service is on the slow side, the very cordial server and the delicious mouth watering menu made it worth while. As the name implies, The Cheesecake Factory specializes on ""cheesecake"", however with the wonderful selections on their menu, the Salad, Pasta's & Farfalle are just too  hard to resist!  The Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic I ordered was terrific! Blanketed with a rich and creamy Parmesan cream sauce, this dish just screams ""eat me!"" I also tried the Chinese Chicken Salad that my sister ordered...what an amazing way to start a meal! Sliced grilled chicken breast, rice noodles, mandarin orange and other delightful goodies consist this refreshing starter! Our table have become a smorgasbord of generous servings of aromatic and mouth watering pasta dishes! With marinara or white sauce, they all looked amazing and tasted fantastic! I have to say, The Cheesecake Factory impressed me, Often I just zoomed and scrolled past TCF when looking for dinner place suggestions, with the fantastic service and generous delicious food serving that we got, I highly recommend giving The Cheesecake Factory a try - it would probably change the way you look at a Cheesecake House.

The hit of the evening was our appetizer, the fried mac n cheese balls they were golden cheesy perfection.

We also got the avocado, zucchini, and portobello mushroom fries as an appetizer the last time we went, and it's an awesome starter! I love portobello fries, and the batter they use here is great! I've never had avocado fries until then and I think it may top portobello fries for me! So creamy on the inside and crunchy on the outside! Love! The staff here are really nice and the service is pretty quick. Great food choice when you have a large party and when you want to maximize your shopping time at the Grove!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=400
Seth B.,"San Dimas, CA",1,172,4,5.0,4/10/2015,"I really do love the Cheesecake factory.  The service and food are both outstanding. The menu is hilariously large, but manages to be creative.  The salads here are surprisingly good and their sandwiches are fresh and flavorful. Ironically, the one thing that isn't very good here is the cheesecake....go figure.  Other deserts are great, however.  The strawberry shortcake is isn't short on anything. Will it change the way you look at food?  No.  But if you're looking for a semi-casual dining experience managed impeccably, then look no further.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=420
Diana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,13,10,4.0,9/1/2014,"I love this place!. The pineapple upside down cheesecake is to die for!. It is the main reason why  come here. However, the rest of the menu is very extensive and tasty. They have a separate menu at 600 caloroes or less!(if you meed that). The lettuce wrapped chicken tavos are great!   Best place to share if you want to have desert and a full meal. Try the chicken madera and steak Diane. Try it!. You can just add a small caesar salad (its big!), share that plate with someone and you will have plenty of space to share fesert. Totally worth it!.  Location thou is always super busy. It is hard to decide to eat here because the wait is always at least 20 min. But today, on labor day, it wasnt. We came here and we were told to wait about 30 min.

Madeline N.,"Torrance, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/6/2016,I made the mistake of going here on a Saturday night at the grove which also happened to be the first week of the Christmas light set up etc. Cheesecake was packed- 1.5 hour wait for 2 people so we sat in the bar. But we fortunately had an awesome server - ALLISON. She was working her ass off to accommodate all her tables and all the special requests. She was so polite and professional even when there were cranky guests testing her patience. We might not be back on Saturday night but will still come for the awesome staff here!

Lidiya M.,"Los Angeles, CA",300,346,735,4.0,5/16/2012,"The first thing you should know is that they DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS. This is a well-known restaurant located in a busy shopping mall in the heart of Los Angeles! What the hell do you think is going to happen if you show up at 7 PM on a Saturday night?! You're going to effing wait. So don't be a dick to the host or bitch to your friends about it--you CHOSE to come here, you CHOSE a busy restaurant, and you CHOSE to come on a noted DATE NIGHT. So stop being such a moron. If you don't want to wait for good food and ambiance, hit up a drive-through. *end rant* I have never once had bad service here. That already says a lot about this place. I've come for lunch, dinner, late night, in between meals, whatever time of day--never gotten a shitty server. In fact, I've always left a good tip here. I feel like, for once, my age is not an issue at this place and the server doesn't treat me like a sub-par customer because I'm not holding a black Amex.  Food I've had here that's rocked my socks: Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pastai CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA!! (my personal favorite) HIBACHI STEAK (server recommended it and it's amazing!) MISO SALMON  Cajun Chicken Littles (my boyfriend gets this EVERY time) Avocado Eggrolls Thai Lettuce Wraps Cheesecake (avoid the low carb one and you'll find a plethora of tasties) Food that's been good, but not stellar: Chicken Madeira (surprising since it's their ""most popular dish"") Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp Chicken Bellagio I can't really speak to their breakfast menu since I've never had it here, and judging by their menu, probably never will. I've had drinks here before and to be honest, it's just not worth it. There's plenty of other places to get drinks and kick back at that have a better drinking vibe. Also, never had any fish dishes here, but I'm curious about them. Maybe next time? Go for the food. And sit on the patio!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=420

It's called ""steak Daine"" meaning a while Steak cut in without altering the look of the actual steak not stew pieces. The meat was so brittle and chewy it was disgusting.  Also, my friend ordered salmon with shrimp scampi and they gave her the salmon and three pieces of grilled shrimp that was clearly not even in the scampi sauce like other cheesecake factories. They seem to do their own thing in the location.  Let's not forget the rude hosts at the door, they all need to be fired and hire new polite employees.

The food is always a 5-star because you can't go wrong with Cheesecake! The service was great. With three large parties located immediately next to our tables, the servers didn't miss a beat. it's the kind of service that corporate offices would dream of. I was very impressed. Cost was very good for the quality and service. For 9 people to have lunch and drinks, it came out to $175 including the added gratuity for the large group. I was very satisfied.

Pau N.,"Hollywood, CA",0,3,4,1.0,10/17/2015,"Just came back from The Cheesecake Factory after having celebrated two birthdays in our party of 6.  The following incidents occurred on a Friday night and I'd understand if the waiters were just having a bad day to begin with. However, it does not constitute their rude behavior and unwarranted comments. The other Yelp reviewers were right when they said that the service was bad. I've withheld the waiters' names to protect their rights. Waiter 1 - Everything was going okay in the beginning and he even took our group photos (not well, unfortunately). Then he wrote down our orders: 1 Da Vinci Pasta, 1 Chicken Scampi, 3 Chicken Madeira, and 1 Bang Bang Chicken. He repeated the order and we thought we were good. Twenty to 30 minutes later, our order arrives, but instead of 3 Madeiras, 2 other waiters bring in 3 Chicken Scampis. We tell them that we only ordered 1 Chicken Scampi.  The waiters go back and probably caused a commotion because Waiter 1 comes over shortly and says aloud, ""Next time, be careful with what you order"", trying to take the blame away from himself and putting it on us. Remember, the guy repeated the order before he left, but he tells us that we got it wrong?  He quickly leaves before we could say anything--we were shocked.  The manager must have gotten word and came over to apologize about the mistake on our order. We told her what rude Waiter 1 said and we confirmed it was only him, and not the other waitress who also attended to us (but more on her later). The manager offered two soups on the house. This lady, unlike her waiters, has good PR and customer service. She alone deserves a star. Waiter 2 - She was the waiter who tended to us for the remainder of the evening. We thought everything was going smoothly, but we were mistaken. One of us in our party had spoken with this waitress early on to let them know that we had 2 birthday celebrants. When it was time for dessert, our friend asked Waiter 2 if she remembered what they spoke about and if they had some kind of birthday treat (which they've done in the past, along with singing 'Happy Birthday'; they even did it that same night for a different table). Waiter 2 says with an attitude that came out of no where: ""We don't offer free cheesecakes; if we did, everyone would be coming here"".  First of all, our friend didn't ask for a free cheesecake. She was trying to help you recall your earlier conversation. Secondly, you are in the customer service industry--what is up with the attitude and why? It seems that Waiter 2, for reasons known only to her, mistook what our friend said. Waiter 2 continues to ask if whether we'd like to order dessert, gives us some time, and leaves to pack up our leftovers. When she came back, we declined in ordering desserts and instead asked for the bill. Did we leave a tip? No way. Would anyone in their right mind leave a tip after being insulted? Twice? No, and no thanks.  We won't be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory located at The Grove. There's a long wait (they don't take reservations), they have rude and untrained waiters, and bad lighting. The only good thing was the manager. Someone give her a raise! With that said, we don't want any of the waiters to be fired from their jobs; we simply want to let it be known that their attitude and behavior was insulting and uncalled for.  After this bad experience, we brought our party to Marmalade Cafe at the Farmer's Market side for dessert. We were met with kindness and great, quality service. Cheesecake Factory, head over to the Marmalade Cafe and you guys might learn a thing or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=420

Really can't go wrong with kids food, ya know.  I had tried the grilled salmon last time and it was dry and too cooked. Asked for not too well this time and it was raw inside. Asked for the Tataki salad to go. Will rule on it once I get to eat it. Ok a little ticked at the Tataki salad. Nothing anywhere says it has ginger. I hate it when people eliminate stuff like that from the menu. If you are going to add a garnish, especially if something so pungent, put it on the G- D menu!! I could've opted out of it!

Zoie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2280,807,1539,3.0,8/8/2012,"Bordering on 3.5 - 4 stars. I feel like I can't exclaim ""I'm a fan!"" because the food wasn't knock my socks off to die for. It was yummy - but I wouldn't scale any cliffs to get at it. I came with my boyfriend and we had the lunch special (turkey sandwich, green salad, and soup of the day) ($11ish), the Shrimp dinner (6 pieces of large shrimp, fries, and cole slaw) ($16ish), a strawberry lemonade ($4.50), and a Guinness ($5.50). We also chowed down on some of that delicious complementary bread they have. Even though the lunch special is supposed to be 'smaller' (a half sandwich) it does come with a full bowl of soup and a nice portion of salad. This alone was tooooooo muchhhhhh foooooood. Honestly, the sandwich and the soup would have been plenty. The soup of the day was a lentil based soup and it was super yummy! The green salad had a nice vinaigrette dressing, however the sandwich was just turkey and a slice of tomato and was easily forgettable.  The shrimp was nice and juicy. The sauce that came with it added a nice kick that was cooled with the tartar sauce. This meal was huge and I think that the boyfriend and I could have been very content just sharing that.  Service was okay. He was friendly and there when needed. Nothing to really write home about.  I should have tried the cheesecake but I always order too much damn food here to ever get around to desert. Next time I'm just going to order the soup and a big fat slab o' cake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=500

We were told if we wanted a table like that we would have to sit at 2 different tables. At that point I decided to go have a look around. As I stroll through the restaurant checking out the scene I see a whole section of tables wide open. So I say to the host hey  can we sit here. Long story short after being told no we can't. They ended up seating us there. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. Our whole party of 8 works in the industry and were up visiting from San Diego.

I guess we just hit them on a bad day because we went back and it was a great experience.  I really appreciate them making the effort to make everything right. Revising my review because of the excellent follow up from them.  Really disappointing visit. I usually love the Cheesecake Factory and this visit was awful. When the bread came out we noticed the napkin on the bottom of the bread was wet and turns out was soaked in coffee. Also the bread had coffee on it too. The waiter brought out new bread.  The waiter didn't refill the drinks and we had to ask multiple times to get ketchup and mayonnaise. The shrimp was not peeled and the food was pretty bad overall.  Since it was our 8 year anniversary it was an incredibly disappointing experience. This is probably the first time I have been disappointed with the food and service for Cheesecake Factory.

I asked, when I picked it up, if there were any special instructions but they said no.  It wasn't like an ice cream cake. A frozen cheesecake is like a rock. Very disappointing as my guests could not eat it (though they made an attempt to lick it like a Popsicle.)  Also disappointing as silly me actually thought they made their cheesecakes fresh there.  Wrote a letter to the manager who sent me a generic letter. My name or date wasn't on the letter. There was no explanation. Just a generic letter they print out and mail. No sincerity. And a gift certificate, which was nice. Never doing that again. Whole cheesecakes are expensive! Not only that, I had to take time off of work to pick it up.

Susan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,236,988,4.0,1/3/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory --- you know what I mean if you've eaten at one or another location once or twice.  I almost never try to go to the Grove's location because it is always packed! People are always waiting and spilling out of the doors. Unless I'm grabbing a slice of cheesecake to go or slipping in to use the ladies' room, you won't find me there during dinner. My group decided they wanted to dine here at 6pm on a super busy evening. I was delighted to learn they can take your cell phone number and text you when your table is ready! I was excited about this and overcame my grumpiness about possibly having to endure waiting because we were able to walk around the stores while we waited for our table. They gave us an estimate of 30 minutes (and I thought... with all these people waiting here? Yeah right!)... and it was actually about 40 minutes when I got the text. Acceptable! We sat on the outdoor patio which was nice except for when The Grove started pumping the fake snow (aka soap bubbles) and it started drifting onto our food. Foodwise, having previously worked across the street from a Cheesecake Factory, I have the usuals I always order. This particular night, I had the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. That thing is like something you can bring to a party to serve 10 people. I'm used to the lunch portion so the dinner portion was just a mountain of deliciousness. I only finished 1/3 of it before being stuffed. Other usual favorites: Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club (without bacon now since I don't eat pork anymore); Cajun Jambalaya with Brown Rice (instead of pasta); Chicken Masala; Mahi Mahi and Shrimp Veracruz; Vietnamese Summer Rolls; Avocado Egg Rolls... Favorite cheesecake: I'm a cheesecake purist so I love the original! On a wild day, I might order the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake.

Natalie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,15,40,2.0,11/13/2013,"GUESS WHAT?  THEY DON'T SELL CAKE @ THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! Why would anyone review The Cheesecake Factory? I mean, do people review McDonalds? Ok... ok, maybe it's not as mainstream as I think it is but let's take a quick look at the bell curve before I make my point: A) Outliers to the left are blurbing one liners because they have been paid/incentivized to opinion-ate in bulk.   B) Masses in the center are either truly pleasantly surprised or remorsefully aggravated. C) Outliers to the right are convinced their opinion matters and suffer from diarrhea-of-the-mouth, and therefore check-in to Yelp even when they visit aunt Sally's restroom.  Don't be offended.  I'm secretly trying to catch up to you.    Currently I'm a B.  With that said I am remorsefully aggravated.  My family and I decided to celebrate my stepfather's birthday at The Cheesecake Factory.  We are busy people.  Picking up a cake for any reason on a Thursday in the midst of our demanding lives isn't something we do.  So The Cheesecake Factory seemed like a no-brainer, right? One would imagine.   I thought my waitress would be impressed when I flashed my baller smile and said, ""We'd like to order an entire cake.  It's his birthday :).""  Turns out, ""Whole cakes are frozen but I'll check with my manager.""  Proceeded by, ""Yeah, we don't do that.""  Hmmmmmm.   So basically what I was subliminally told was:  1.) I can't offer you what you want, but I'm going to double-check and make sure what I've been trained to say is really true because it doesn't even make sense to me.  2.) Yes, we may have an entire display case of all sorts of cakes ready to go but we'd rather let them mesmerize the window gawking dieters than profit off of you.  Only Jesus knows why.  How does this story end?  Drinks thrown at the manger's face?  A vengeful dine and dash? No.  We gracefully ordered 6 variations of cheesecakes and asked the waitress to at least attempt a nice presentation.  Hopefully they'd figure out how to form a pie from six slices. Needless to say--they didn't.  Also needless to say, I'm smart enough to realize that kind of money can buy better service with or without an entire cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=520

I usually order the grilled chicken avocado club sandwich with sweet potato fries and it is always made to perfection. My wife orders either the miso salmon or their luao salad and swears by them both. Our favorite appetizer is the avocado egg rolls that come with some delicious dipping sauce. As for the service at The Grove location. Terrible.There was a party of 8 of us and we were told 105 minute wait for lunch. After 120 minutes we started to get fussy and irritable. Still no table. After 130 minutes, we decided to find out what is going on. Turns out, they were readying tables to sit our party, but someone sat down a couple at a table and to their right was our tables and to their left, our tables. So basically, they sat down this couple that divided the tables that were being held for us. They didn't want to move the couple and instead were waiting for them to eat their orders, deserts etc. Well, that wasn't happening for us. We walked over to the couple and asked if we could move them over so we can get the tables together and they agreed. We explained to the Manager and the people doing the seating that making us wait was a terrible idea, silly at best and could of been resolved 30 minutes ago by asking the couple to just allow us to scoot their table over and let us bring the other tables around them so they can be consolidated. To make us wait a total of 143 minutes what plain crap. No one apologized, comped us anything or tried to make us feel better for such a long wait. Too bad it was my wife's birthday celebration and we wasted almost 2 1/2 hours just waiting for Cheesecake to get our tables ready. When we asked for a cake for my wife's birthday, they couldn't even have the common sense to bring a piece of cake with a candle on it! Common guys. I've never had any problems with any other location, but I think the volume of customers at The Grove along with the small Cheesecake Factory location was a bad combination.

However, weekend nights (Friday-Sunday), they get really busy and waits can take up to an hour for a party of 2.  Also, during those times, waiter service gets really slow as they have to deal with many other tables.  One time, our party of 8 had to wait over an hour to get our food served, which was really ridiculous.  My dad ended up talking to the manger, and he apologized, which I really appreciated. My go-to dishes are--  Appetizers: Spinach and Cheese dip, Avocado Egg Rolls, Sweet Tamale Corn Cakes, Buffalo Blasts (ask for honey mustard dipping sauce), Stuffed Mushrooms Entrees: Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Chicken Marsala, Crusted Chicken Romano, Thai Chicken Pasta, Miso Salmon Desserts: Tiramisu You can ask for extra sauce for the pasta entrees, which is really great.   I find that this cheesecake factory makes their dishes more flavorful than the Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto (which is weird, considering it's a chain restaurant and you would expect them to have the same recipe at each chain). There is happy hour from 4-6pm on weeknights, ONLY if you are seated at the bar.  Happy hour features $5 appetizers and select drinks, which is a bargain!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=580

Suddenly, a woman and her young child are rushing towards our table - the woman has a napkin over the girls mouth, and the girl is vomiting into the napkin and on the floor.  A waitress points the woman in the direction of the bathroom and proceeds to cover the vomit on the floor with a few napkins.  Other wait staff did the same thing with the vomit path leading to the bathroom.   My friend and I watched as the wait staff walked over and slipped on these napkins, for almost 10 minutes. Finally, my friend tells one of them that they should probably clean it up properly before someone slips and falls.  Someone brought out a swiffer type dry mop and cleaned it up without soap and water. Not very sanitary for a place that serves food.  We received our food - teriyaki chicken and a turkey burger.  The chicken was ok, but the rice was under cooked and hard.  The turkey burger was bland and dry.  We didn't want to send any food back because at this point, we just wanted to get out of there.  Safe to say, I will not be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=580
Airn T.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,74,52,4.0,9/1/2013,"If there's ever a time where you want total assurance that you're going to get great food, decent prices, and a superb waitstaff, save yourself the trouble and go to the Cheesecake Factory. The location at the Grove get busy, so plan ahead. Go in and pick up a buzzer before you're starving and by the time you get called, you'll be ready to eat. The buzzer has a fairly long range (from water fountain to the Farmer's Market entrance near Marmalade Cafe), so you can shop/window shop while you wait. Last night I showed up at 9:30 and waited 55 minutes for a table for 2! They don't take reservations so BE PREPARED! The seating can get crowded indoors, so opt to sit outdoors and take in the sights from the balcony.  The waiters are always great. Well versed in the menu, helpful when you're indecisive, never pushy, etc.  TIPS: + Don't order an appetizer unless you aren't getting an entree. They bring out fresh rye and sourdough bread for every table.  + There are lunch portions available for many of the entree's - always ask! + Dessert portions are ALWAYS big enough for two or three. The Lemoncello Cake is my fave but the Strawberry Shortcake is always a winner as well. + There are a couple of televisions above the bar. Last night they showed football and a Jeopardy rerun. :) One thing about this location that gets under my skin: there are only 4 stalls in the ladies room. Yep. That means that while there may be an excess of 70+ women here at any time, there's only room for 4 bums at a time.

Andrew G.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,145,12,2.0,6/28/2015,"The entire weekend staff members are basically out of their minds.  I hope the manager reads this to them.   Showed up on a Saturday, right when they open.  We were probably only the 2nd party to walk into the door... Basically it was empty.    Girl at front desk asks me the usual, ""how many?"", ""inside or outside?"", ""can I get your name?""... Then sends us up the escalator to the 2nd check in desk.  Again keep in mind no one is in the restaurant.  Also note: I asked to be seated outside balcony... More to come on this. Arrive at 2nd check in desk upstairs.  They ask me for my name.  I give it to them.  They check their computer to make sure I'm in the system.  I say ""they"" because it required multiple staff members to figure this out.  They look at the computer, then look back at me... ""andrew?"" (Well duh... Who else would I be? I just said my name... No one else is around... ) Someone new comes to take us to the table... And we follow... Only to arrive at a table inside... Not outside.  We told the staff that we specifically asked to sit outside.  The host looked confused and said they needed to go check at the counter to confirm the table.  (No clue why they can't just sit me at the table I want to sit at because the restaurant is literally empty except for one other party) Finally the host comes back to tell us they don't know what happened and we need to go back to the front counter to resolve the issue.  So, we walk back to the counter and the same staff members were still there.  Shit you not... They asked me for my name again.  I told them again that I specifically asked for a table outside on the balcony.  They confirm with the computer, all smiles, and tell me ""Right this way"".   Shit you not, they literally took me to the same table inside... Again.  So, I laughed, tell the host once again that this is not the table I requested and that I requested a table outside on the balcony.  Again.. Let me remind you that THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT.   So we are instructed to go back to the front desk to clear this up, again.  I know this sounds insane but it is all true, bear with me.   We arrive at the front desk and once again they ask me for my name.  Dear staff, my name is Andrew dammit.  3 people standing at the front desk this whole time and none of them could remember my name.  Anyways, they check the computer to confirm, again.  They still look confused.  So I tell them again, who I am, and that we are a party of 2, and we specifically asked for a table outside.  They seemed to have figured it out now and off we go. Just wait there is actually more.   We finally get outside and they showed me to our table.  This table was near the door, and since the restaurant was empty I saw no harm is asking to take a different table that was right against the middle section of the balcony.  Shit you not... The host literally said ""hold on I need to check to make sure that table is available"" and proceeds to call the front desk.  First of all... As all you Yelpers fully understand by now... The restaurant was f*cking empty lol.  2nd, I've tried making reservations at this location and they have explained to me they do not take reservations and therefore there is no possible way that the table we want is taken.

The place was beyond packed. We were told the wait would be an hour and a half. Fine. We went to the Farmer's Market and grabbed a drink to kill some time.

After about an hour and 40 minutes, we still hadn't heard from them so we walked back and they told me that there was a mix-up and they couldn't reach us. I was annoyed because we had been waiting for them and they had just given our table to someone else. But they realized it was their mistake so they did the right thing and gave us the next available table right away. We sat outside on the upstairs patio. You can't really complain about The Cheesecake Factory menu - it has literally anything and everything you could possibly be in the mood for. I love their bread, too. I tried the fish tacos because in all my years of coming here I never had those before. They were pretty good, but just like everything else on the menu - the portions were huge.

To start, my friend and I had the pomegranate drinks--the mojito and and margarita, which was pretty good.  I liked the mojito better.  We started with the crabcake appetizer.  There's about three of them and it's served with mustard and tarter sauce laid on a garnished plate.  My friend likes ordering crabcakes and she said this was pretty good and it's a lot better than the ones we normally have.   I forget what my friend ordered, but I know it's a shrimp pasta.  I haven't had enough of it to tell you what I think, but one bite was good.   I ordered the Char-grilled cutlet steak made with USDA prime sirloin steak, crispy onion rings, steak butter, and fries for $17.95.  It's one of their affordable steaks and I didn't feel like going all out because we ordered a bunch of food anyhow.  I like my beef cooked medium rare and that's what I got and it was good.   For dessert, we could decide on the cheesecake, but the server brought out the BIG menu they have up front so we could see it.  Actually, my friend wanted to get a cheesecake for her family--she decided on a 7 inch original.  We tried a slice of the Red Velvet Cheesecake, which was pretty big  At that point, we were already full and only had a couple of bites.  I was not going to eat the whole thing because that's about 1500 calories!  I took the cheesecake home and ate bites throughout the whole weekend!  It was delicious...the cake was moist, cheesecake was good.  Yum.   In general, The Cheesecake Factory has good food and great presentation and the food is good and it is consistent throughout the other chains I've been to.  I like the ambiance and the decor and the dim lighting is a nice touch.  I like how it's busy and the servers still pay attention to us and make sure we have everything we need.  I like this location because it's at The Grove.  In general, food is overpriced and it doesn't really stand out for me.  I like how they have a small plates and snacks menu if you're not up for spending too much.  I still like it.  I like the cheesecakes at least!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=660
Woof W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,32,,5.0,1/9/2015,"Busy. Busy. Busy. That can be good or bad news depending how you view it. Make yourself more than enough time as you will probably be waiting for a table, like everyone else.  There is a solution: inform the host that sitting at the Bar is a acceptable option.  My friend and I do it. Great advantages: Fantastic service from the Bartender.  View the vast shelves of liquors. The designs on some of the bottles is artwork.  No need to feel frustrated with that familiar experience patrons dislike: "" where is the waiter/ waitress?""  Bartenders are customer service friendly.  We had no complaints.  Sometimes it is possible to walk in and make for the stairs straight to the bar yourself.  Sometimes the host will say the bar seats are filled.  That restaurant and bakery are busy due to good food and desserts. Repeat business is a good sign it is worth the visit.  Bad side? Waiting during busy hours. At those times it can sound loud with all the surrounding talk.  It is to be expected. Worth repeated visits. Their bakery has take outs. They have a busy line there. Some good choices sell out fast.  Try to call in advance to inquire if it is possible to make reservations.  Additionally, ask when they have off peak hours to make a trip there to eat.

Yawen C.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",35,97,72,3.0,4/1/2011,"I came here for date night with my bf. Dinner, cheesecake, and a movie! The portions are huge, even the starter salads, that we both barely ate half of our meal. Leftovers for lunch tomorrow! The house salad with balsamic vinaigrette is extremely light on the dressing. A health-conscious individual would like this, but my bf definitely didn't. The caesar salad is slightly better. We also really like their breads, which are nice and soft and warm =) I ordered the CHICKEN BELLAGIO and he ordered the SOUTHEAST ASIAN CARAMEL CHICKEN. The bellagio was definitely better. Nice balance between the pasta, chicken, arugula, and prosciutto. However, the dish as a whole felt really dry; would've been nice if there was some kind of sauce. The caramel chicken felt like high-end Panda stir-fry like orange chicken. The carrots, string beans, onions, and mushrooms tasted alright, but the rice was like Uncle Ben's microwavable rice. And cheesecake? DEFINITELY THE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE. OMG SO GOOD IT MAKES ME WANT TO CRY.

I used to eat the carrot cake on Beverly dr, and it's the best carrot cake and frosting I've ever tried. Yums! Oh I used to like their white chocolate raspberry latte but it's not on the menu anymore... I like their food even though it's like chain restaurant. Oh, last time, they forgot our crab cake appetizers and the manager gave it to us for free. So nice right? But then another time, their service was super slow and like practically non existent. Oh and another time I forgot to print out the coupon for free cheesecake for every $30 spent, and the manager came and said it's ok cos I showed him the email on my new iPad haha. So basically, the service is up and down, but the food is good. I wish they would open this franchise in hong kong, cos i'll be moving there soon. And. I mean, they have cpk there, which I would say is this restaurant's competitor, but I understand that rent is super high there. Anyway, yes, love cheesecake factory.

Chris R.,"Las Vegas, NV",277,248,664,4.0,5/5/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is centrally located inside of The Grove outside shopping experience. The restaurant has a terrace area which they seem to turn tables more quickly than inside, which is a tip if you are in a bit more of a hurry. That's a relative term as there are always a lot of people waiting to eat here. The chairs outside are slightly smaller and not that great for those of us who have skipped a few visits to the gym. They do offer a buzzer, but it only works slightly outside of the door and definitely not at the book store next door. The wait time is fairly accurate, so when they tell you an hour and a half, go for a walk. The biggest difference about this location over others, is that you are escorted up escalators to get to your table. There are no tables on the first floor. There is an elevator in case you need it. The bar is on one end of the restaurant but unfortunately drinks do take extra time to get refilled and delivered. I've been coming to this location over the past eight years plus and each time I have had a different experience. Sometimes, I go for a quick snack down the way at Farmer's Market to deal with the long wait times.

As for the food....the only two things I order when I come here is the thai lettuce wraps and pasta da vinci! The thai lettuce wraps are appetizers, but they give you a lot so I eat it as a meal! The vegetables are fresh and I love the sauces that they have! Not exactly sure what the sauces are, but it tastes good :) Pasta da vinci....YUMMY. love mushrooms in my pasta. It's not creamy like some pastas, so you can eat a lot of it! The last time I was there, the pasta was cooked al dente. SO SO GOOD :) I'm craving some right now!

Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4475,2216,19024,4.0,1/2/2011,"Not all Cheesecake Factory restaurants are the same.  Thanks to the fake snow, fake tree, and ""real"" Santa on Christmas Eve ... the Grove was packed ... as were the restaurants.  The Cheesecake Factory was the perhaps the busiest. * The Good: Miso Salmon is among the better entree choices because the Salmon is marinated in fresh Miso and then served with thick Miso Sauce, Snow Peas, and White Rice.  This is remarkably consistent and tasty at all the locations where I've tried it. Honorable Mention: A slice of Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake to go.  Packed in a slice-shaped container (including spot for Whipped Cream), I'm a sucker for the layered Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse and Chocolate.    * The Bad: Eager to branch out for something new, I opted for the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta.  This could be among the oddest favor combinations I've tasted.  First the pasta was way too al dente.  Then the Honey Glazed Chicken didn't match at all with the Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce. Mixed with Asparagus, Peppers, Peas, and Onion this dish is worth skipping.  Luckily the menu is huge. Honorable mention:  The place was busy and the place was committed to serving as many tables as possible.  To achieve this tables for two were placed practically side-by-side.  We were happy to get a table, but hated having to listen to the lonely guy/mom pair on our right and the awkward couple on our left. * The Ugly The Wait.  Is any place worth a 75 minute wait?  We had to wait 25 minutes just to get the ""pager"" so we could know when our 75 min wait was over.  We tried hovering over some tables in the bar area for a while (as were lots of other couples), but finally resigned ourselves to accept our wait fate downstairs amongst the hordes.  No matter how good a place is, enduring such a long wait deflates the experience. Honorable mention:  The disorganized crush of people trying to get to the hostess counter was a mad free-for all.  I feel sorry for the staff having to try and make the best of it each night.  Wouldn't reservations help?

The one thing I don't like is the seating situation. If you don't get a booth, you're pretty close to the people next to you. So if you don't like others in your personal bubble and don't mind waiting a few extra minutes, request a booth   When the host/hostess welcomes you into the restaurant! I forgot my server's name(I'm sure it is on my receipt) but he was phenomenal. Just a genuinely nice guy. Not too cheesy and not a rude server who is over it. He was perfect.

Food - The boneless buffalo wings were delicious and severed crispy. For the main course, ordered my favorite....meatloaf. However the taste was off. It was saltier than usual. The mashed potatoes and succotash were very good.  Service - I know it was a busy night but the waiter wasn't as attentive as I needed him to. Had to flag him down several times for drink refills. After asking for a to go box, I decided to have another slice of bread. As I was eating, the waiter removes my plate under me which I thought was a bit rude, since he saw that I was still eating. No, this wasn't my meatloaf plate, but the little platter for the bread. The waiter himself, I didn't catch his name was a bit arrogant, not as friendly as other staff in other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=440

The manager, when called, was not attentive or considerate. Made a big deal about crediting the meals that were not served. The bread was tasty and one specialty meal was brought correctly.

Sxholastica Z.,"West Covina, CA",12,19,181,5.0,2/9/2014,I always come to this branch I've been to the one in the grove and it always disappoints me unlike this branch. They dont have RSVP but You gotta make  come to the front desk 45 earlier to RSVP in person so u can get in faster. it's sometimes Bz. They start you off with complimentary bread and butter  Brown Sweet wheat bread and sourdough bread cut diagonally.  They tell you they're name. I remember one was Sean a nice cute guy with glasses and I think the nice asian girl name Clarissa. The servers are always nice and considerate. I've been here 5 times or more and its nice eat indoors if you don't like the wind. Gets windy and cold outdoors so I stay indoors. I always! Always get the firecracker salmon. It's literally fireworks in your mouth. $12 but worth the experience. It's like a egg roll salmons and the sauce it very unique it's not spicy but it has a kick to it that's delectable to your pallet. It comes with cabbages so mix it and turn it into a salad. Excellent sauce.  I always get the Fettuccine Sundried tomatoes pasta. They make their fettuccine pasta thick and the sauce is so hearty creamy. Very satisfying. The plate can feed 2 people If u wanted. All they're plates are huge!  I always get a nice drink like the Strawberry Fruit Smoothie it has a ripe strawberry on top very soothing to your throat. I like it But I always get the strawberry lemonade cuz I love lemonade. I prefer you to try their drinks.  Over all experience I love their food and atmosphere and customer service.

Jackie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,164,352,1.0,7/17/2014,"Don't get me wrong-- I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan. They have a menu BOOK so whether you want pasta, fish, steak, chicken, sandwich, salad-- they have it. I wouldn't say their dishes are excellent but it's a good choice when quantity & medium quality is the name of the game. My personal favorite is the avocado egg roll cuz it's served with a side of crack sauce. Entree wise I like the chicken pasta plate (I think it's the Louisiana chicken with mushrooms & bell peppers). Cheesecake wise the raspberry truffle cheesecake is amazing.  That being said, why does this location suck so much? It seems so fancy when you walk in because you enter to see the hostess section & then you have to take a long escalator (or the stairs) to the dining area. But the service is SUCH A FAIL. The servers travel in packs of 2 cuz they're so busy chatting with each other. They forget to bring your much needed cocktails & bread until you remind them 15 minutes after ordering. They tell you they told the kitchen not to add certain ingredients (ahem: cilantro) but your dish will have cilantro. They try to charge you for things you did not order. They take SOO long to process your bill that you start to wonder if you need to ask about it.  Food was whatever but service was so bad this place gets 1 star. Not a fan-- would not revisit.

Thankfully, the Cheesecake Factory HQ was kind enough to apologize for the situation in which we were grateful.  So, when we arrived at the restaurant we already knew that we were going to get some hate from this. Anyway we tried to brush of the glaring, shooting-daggers-at-you looks from the hostesses and just went about our business. Our waitress was friendly at first but I feel like someone told her our meal was comped, and then she was not-so-friendly and was only to be found when it was bill time.  I had a menu in my hand to order a cheesecake later. So, my sister ordered first and then I was in the process of telling her my order when she just grabbed the menu from my hand and walked away. Yeah, we were appalled but we still tipped her well.  I want to point out that, maybe once a month, my family chooses this establishment to dine in and we ALWAYS order a lot. However, we decided to decrease the amount of dishes we usually order since we felt bad. I loved eating at the Cheesecake Factory before but now, I'm not so sure.

Bonnie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,45,22,4.0,4/27/2015,"We have been here about 6 or 7 times and I wouldn't slate the place, the place is lovely, well decorated, the staff are lovely, attentive and so forth. You expect a wait, and a longer wait for outdoors. Just accept that as it goes with the popularity of the place. We still like it here and will continue to return but there are some niggles and it's not always 100%....for one, they have an awful noise problem inside, one that I'm not even sure they are aware of. We sat inside on Sunday night and it was awful, we were almost shouting our conversation to each other, the racket caused by staff clattering knives and forks was deafening as was overall staff noise. It reminded me of a school canteen. The music was much lower on the decibel list than the staff and kitchen noises flooding out and even drowned out customer chatter. Not a pleasant noise. Especially not a nice noise To try and sip a nice Malbec in! There is a time issue too as we have twice still been eating starters when hot mains come out? Who wants to sit watching $30 of main courses go cold?....Also, I don't know why they feel that it's a nice idea to leave a gap of 4cm between tables for 2, it was ridiculous, we were a 2 but almost a forced table of 4, which was uncomfortable, but this shouldn't have to be pointed out, lastly the whole bill nonsense coming far earlier than you want it is just rude, annoying, interrupts conversations, puts pressure on the customers to leave and if they have a $40 near full bottle of red sat in front of them it's not nice. I feel sometimes that the real acid test is that the manager goes in the restaurant and sits like a customer and sees and hears and feels what they do, it's a test which I'm sure would always see changes. We received the bill without asking for it with a lot of wine left in our bottle and she brought the bill and said ,no rush sir, but there is, always is, as we continued to talk she came back and picked up the empty wallet, interrupting us again,we apologised saying we hadn't done it yet..... We stopped our conversation yet again at a point we hadn't planned, he ruffled through the wallet.... Just a rude interruption, there is clearly a rush, they hover around, watching for cards going in wallets, you feel uncomfortable, rushed and after paying we put some cash tip under a glass after getting our card back and we were interrupted again with a snatch of the cash and her saying 'I'll get that out of your way sir, .........it wasn't in our way? I can understand it when they need tables, both times there were many spare tables so it's just their practice I suppose. Saying all that, All the food seems to come out well, we especially love the Thai chicken wrap starter using lettuce leaves and triple Chinese style sauces. Most of the startrpers we have tried and we love, the small Greek salad is especially tasty. We really hated a dish of strawberry shortcake last week where a soggy super large biscuit was placed floating in red sugar syrup, served with equally marinated in sugar syrup strawberries with ok ice cream and a huge amount of cream to give it the ridiculous effect of a tower......not nice in so many ways,sickly, ridiculously too large and soggy and sugary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=480

Karan S.,"West Hills, CA",2,7,,1.0,2/5/2015,"Extremely rude people! We were a party of 12 people and had called a couple of days in advance to reserve a table for dinner. They did not take any reservations and were not helpful at all with any suggestions.  We were asked to reach and hour and a half before we wanted to reach, so as to get a table. We reached an hour earlier than scheduled and were asked to wait for an hour more. Lady at the front desk was rude! We went upstairs to use the restroom and we see 3 tables totally empty! We asked to be seated there or at least be shown our prospective table, but we were out rightly refused. We simple wanted to smack that lady across the face as she was treating us like some unwanted POS.  We left immediately and walked across the Street to another restaurant. The loss is purely of this place and we will strongly dissuade our friends and family members from visiting this place, where the staff is snobby and arrogant, and treats large groups (the onez who fuel the revenue growth) with disdain!

Liz C.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,173,52,3.0,3/8/2011,"I think the only reason I come here is to get a reminiscent feeling of the days when I thought Cheesecake was the finest dining experience in all of Los Angeles (HA! Boy, was I wrong!) and I loved eating unhealthy 'cause I just didn't care -_-  Cheesecake is known for their huge portions and you're really paying the price for the ginormous portions here. I'm talking enough to dine-in and eat for lunch the day after, and in some plates, a mid-day snack. Huge.. Nearly everything I've had was delicious and filling. Pizzas are cooked to the perfect crisp and steaks are grilled to desired perfection. But they seem to all have one thing in common and it's how heavy these foods are. The salads give off this feeling too. Seriously, after I walk out of here, I don't feel like going back for another month or two. Service is on some days and then back off most days. One time, the kitchen ran out of fuel (Yeah, I know..) after we'd ordered our dinners and received our drinks. As if that wasn't bad enough, our server made us pay for our drinks, although we explained how ridiculous it was. So ridic. As you can tell, I have major mixed feelings about this here, Cheesecake Factory, at the Grove or anywhere else. It's just somewhere I'd be seen eating once in a long while. Oh, my latest experience was the bistro shrimp pasta. It's delicious, but you know just how bad it is for you when you discover the huge amounts of oil in the pasta sauce at the bottom of the plate.

I wanted to have something light and somehow ended up with chicken piccata over angel hair pasta. Tasty and honestly, this was light without the rich and super creamy sauce.  This meal was enough to have as 2 meals.  This is the only time that I get excited about the next day's lunch leftovers.  The hubs had his usual burger - plain and nothing fancy.  He doesn't complain about the burger but doesn't rave about it either.  I forgot to mention that the sangria is strong, but quite tasty.  As for cheesecake,  had to pass on that tonight, since we were headed to Sprinkles.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=860

This place has runied the Cheesecake Factory name.. and yes the food is delcious but the service is HORRIBLE and apparently so is management. I went here on a Saturday afteroon with my guy friend and his boyfriend (who I never met before), that were from out of town.... When our waitress came over, I (singular) asked her what the soup of the day was.. she told me, so I (singluar) asked her for a sample.. she came back with the sample of soup and THREE spoons... to share. I was the only one who asked to sample.. so then the two guys picked up the spoons, (mind you... one was coughing and sneezing all day  and im a germ a phob) well, I took a spoon and I picked up the bowl (bcuz the waitress put it in the center of the table). The waitress stood there shocked and seriously looked at me like I was rude.. then she was like.. ""well I guess Ill go get another one""...Long story short... my friends felt offended becuase I wouldnt share, i felt grossed out that she wanted me to share and I felt like I was put in a very ackward situation becuase really.. either way you wanna put it.. friends.. strangers.. etc.. soup is soup and sharing of soup is gross, its like sharing cereal.  So.... having been to MANY cheesecake factories... chicago... boulder, CO... palo alto.. ft. lauderdale.. etc.. I decided to write a letter to management at This particular restaurant.  I wrote a VERY detailed letter and NEVER HEARD BACK. I provided my phone number and my address and I never got a follow up call. And really.. to be honest, I was expecting a call AND a giftcard to come back. What happened to client satisfaction? I had a horrible embarassing experience and it should be made up for.  With that said, and the lack of management involvement, I wont be going back.. and thats too bad becuase I have A LOT of friends who visit me and A LOT of clients to bring out, and usually Cheesecake Factory is the #1 go to spot.. but not anymore, and Ill be telling all my coworkers as well.

Tim H.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,196,116,2.0,5/25/2010,"Wow, I was so surprised, the food here is actually OK. I was expecting tourist fast food, but it was tasty. Now, the food did take a tad more than an hour to get to my table and was missing ingredients, but it was still very good food.  The waiters, apparently you get to have three or four waiters, are OK.  I got my drink after about 25 minutes, but the bread did come after only a 15 minute wait. The first waiter took the drink order, and soon after, the second waiter took the drink order again.  BUT, he also took the food order. Waiter three brought the drink order, after I asked about it three times. Waiter three took the desert order, and waiter four dropped it off. The bill was not horrible, a bit more than it should be - but this is a tourist place, so it is what it is.   The serving size is way WAY more than you need.  I recommend splitting an entree.   I don't think I will be back again, as this dinner took more than 90 minutes, and was a simple two course meal consisting of a tostada salad and a piece of cheesecake. With so many employees, I think that the higher bill pays for the extra staff.  It is nice in this economy to know that some employers hire more than they need.  I only wish I could have received the right food order within 30 minutes of giving it to the waiter. I would pass on this place, unless you have out-of-town visitors coming that just must visit.  If you really need to go, plan to spend a little extra cash, a lot of time, and for the food to be OK. I liked my tostada salad, it was really quiet tasty!  The cheesecake?  Well, I appreciated knowing that one slice was just over 1400 calories, and was lower than many!  OMG! Oh, I forgot to mention.  You get a pager, so you can shop and wait for your turn to be seated.  Then, after that 30 minute wait, you get sent upstairs, where you wait another 15 minutes to be seated.  Time from checking in to getting food, almost two hours.  Uh.....  I just don't understand the appeal? Maybe you could order, go see a movie, and when you get out and have a table ready, with food all set?  That would be the way to go, since the theater is right next door!

The wait might be a little long sometimes during the day, but you can make reservations before 6 p.m. It's worth it though...you can always kill some time in the mall until the beeper goes off. The waiters are very friendly, however the service might be a little slow if it is busy.   Try the Hershey's cheesecake, and then they have 45 other kinds of cheesecake!

So they do not have a gluten free menu or list allergens on their website. But they are helpful accommodating special diets. I usually get the salmon. I have gotten burgers before protein style. You can usually replace any of the sides. I switched fries for broccoli. (I know, it broke my heart too!)  I love The Grove but I like the Marina Del Rey Cheesecake Factory better.  Sadly if you are gluten free I don't think any of the cheesecakes are.

Antonio R.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,113,5,2.0,9/30/2011,"This is about my fifth time coming to the Cheesecake Factory. The service/food here has always been, ""meh"" on average if service and the quality of food are taken into account and taken as equally important [which is what I believe].  Food: The food itself is hit and miss. Sometimes you'll get great food and other times, you'll get flavorless food. Cashew Chicken usually tends to be flavorful and it is a good dish overall. However, I always ask for Asparagus to be placed in there. That didn't happen this time. The server, pretentiously, stated that anything extra wouldn't work with the dish. Please, I've tried it and it's better with asparagus. Anyway, it was a decent dish in the end. We also ordered Louisiana noodles which had such a subtle taste, that they might as well have been tasteless. Service: Terrible service. I'm in my late teens and I feel that because of this, the server looked down on us. My girlfriend wanted something like fried chicken, so I asked if they had any.   Know what the server responds? ""Well if you're looking for KFC style chicken...."" Really? He said it as if we should not be allowed into the restaurant for being young. That was pretty offensive but I took it. When I first had the guy, I believe his name was William but I am not quite sure....[big guy, about 6'1 and with a heavier rame]... I politely said, ""Excuse me"" to get his attention, considering he was 5 feet away and doing nothing. He does nothing.  ""Excuse me?"" I said again.  He turns around and said, ""Wait!"" and that was that. Overall, bad server. The funny thing is that toward the end, he started being extremely nice to us - gee, I wonder why. Once we gave him the tip (which was 10% for his lackluster service) he didn't even say thank you or have a nice day. In fact, he said nothing and looked down as if we were the ones who short-sided him. Service was quick. Ambiance: It's nice in there, too bad the lights are too dim to be able to see anything.

Kai L.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",1130,411,803,2.0,7/14/2009,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, so if you've been to one before, you already know about the food choices and the cold-case of whole cheesecakes available near the front of the restaurant. This one is no different so far as the food selection goes -- you get moderately sized dishes at moderate prices  -- with nothing on the menu being particularly outstanding and worthy of making a specific trip out there. Even the vaunted cheesecakes, supposedly so delicious that the restaurant itself is named for their sake -- aren't anything to write home about. Basically, if you're already at The Grove, tired from shopping (or holding someone else's purse while they try on stuff) and aren't in the mood for something quick and cheap (such as a Wetzel's Pretzel or just eating in the food court in the Farmer's Market), The Cheesecake Factory is an okay choice if you aren't planning a romantic date or don't mind the sound of screaming children and metal and ceramic dinnerware being plonked down onto kitchen counter tops by the staff. Once you get into the restaurant and ride the escalator (yes, an escalator) to the second-floor dining area, you will sort of feel a ""cafeteria"" or ""Hometown Buffet"" type vibe to the place, which, depending on your particular mindset, could be a good or bad thing. Even though you're on the second floor, don't expect any sweeping views of the scenery outside. Yep, blocked! Compared to other Cheesecake Factory locations (such as Sherman Oaks or Beverly Hills), The Grove location has rather middling service that is hit or miss, not that ANY Cheesecake Factory is all that great anyway, though: at The Grove, sometimes your server will be great, sometimes he or she doesn't want to be at work, and their expression and service shows it. Did you finish off your Coke? Yeah, well, expect to wait ten or fifteen minutes for it to get filled up again. If you're planning a more grown-up style outing such as a date or dinner with other grown up friends and would like a more mature atmosphere, Morel's French Steakhouse or Wood Ranch BBQ and Grill (both within the same outdoor mall as Cheesecake Factory) are much better choices.  Ironically, Anne Morton's and Wood Ranch BBQ aren't much more pricey than Cheesecake Factory, and will usually serve you more quickly and more pleasantly -- in a pleasanter (is that a word? No? Well, it stays) atmosphere to boot. Overall, this Cheesecake Factory feels like a factory, where you, the customer, are on an assembly line waiting your turn to get pushed around and annoyed for a while, before finally leaving a bunch of money behind to thank them for the favor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=900

Tori A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/19/2013,"I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory before several times and something must be wrong with their washing machine or management is not supervising adaquately or they just don't care but the plate used to eat the courtesy bread was DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY, GREASY AND SMELLY. It looked as if it was wiped down with a dirty towel or with the hand and it smelled like rotten eggs. Do they just use water to rinse these plates??? I can only imagine what the plates with the meals look like. The cup given to me for my tea looked dirty and was scratchy everywhere I didn't finish my tea because I felt disgusted. To top that off, I asked two different people to give me a cleaner plate and sadly enough, I was practically given the same dirty, smelly dish. Scientifically, if a swab was rubbed across these plates, I know for a fact it would show several bacterias present and that's what your eating. I had to put a napkin over my plate to eat my bread. It was disappointing because this could potentially be a health hazard!! This may be a small issue for some but  cleaneliness needs to be a TOP PRIORITY for every restauran regardless of  status. Some people don't have a habit of washing their hands before eating and when they touch these plates, their germs from picking their nose and heaven knows what else they pick and touch, ends up in those half-washed plates!! Gross but TRUE!!!  So Cheesecake from The Grove, PLEASE get it together and find out what's going on with your washing and disinfecting system. You served many people and I know you are super busy. If what's working right now is not working, then figure out how you can change it, get a bigger machine or hire more people to wash dishes PROPERLY. It's going to be a while before I return to eat at your restaurant (not that it will matter or make a difference to you), but others will definitely read this.

Prior to starting to write this review, I went back to read if I had ever reviewed a Cheesecake Factory before.  I have, and not surprisingly, my thoughts have not changed much.  Almost all of my experiences at various Cheesecake Factories have been virtually identical.  Therefore, most of this review is recycled material, but still relevant: I try to to avoid the Cheesecake factory because I always seem to find them having an extraordinarily long wait for food that I would consider slightly above average.  We waited at this specific Cheesecake factory for about 45 minutes, which was terrible with our active 4 year old and not many available places to sit. The service was OK.  The employees ODed on the schmoozing, and were not all that great at the details. The food was just like every other Cheesecake factory to me; overrated with unfathomably high calorie counts (if something has that many calories it better taste damn good!).  A couple of weeks back when we went here, I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  It was pretty good, and came with some tasty mash potatoes and asparagus.  However, they have a pretty similar dish at BJ's that I think tastes much better and is much cheaper as well.   To finish off my meal, I got a slice of the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.  It was one of the better cheesecakes I have had here, but it was nothing special.  I honestly believe that the frozen Cheesecake Factory cakes that you can buy at your local supermarket taste better than the ones at the actual restaurant.  Strange, I know.  I just think their desserts are overrated. After another visit to the Cheesecake factory I can say that not much has changed.

Yes, I am a regular at this restaurant because of their great service, legit food and their toothsome DESSERTS such as the CHEESECAKE! This restaurant gets super crowded every night. WHY? Because there are plenty of tourist people here at The Grove and Farmer's Market is just across the street. Whenever I go to this restaurant, I usually just go straight to the high stool tables near the bar. Yes, I  do sit in front of the bar with two sport tv screens and the desire to buy a drink looking over those YUMMEH alcoholic beverages. Well, I like these tables more because luckily we never wait for the table.  Once you've settled in, a server will immediately give you the menu, talk about their specials for today and ask for your drinks. Then they leave and come back to serve you some warm nicely toasted bread with a side of BUTTER(Ohlala!). After you've eaten your bread, you will definitely feel full from all those bread they have served you. So, I say slow down on the bread and wait for your entree. Plus the entree portion is generously big, that could be shared for two. As for myself, I can never finish a full entree from their menu which is why I only order their snacks or appetizers instead. And through out your experience, the servers and even the managers will check up on you and ask you about your meal. But make sure you have enough room for the DESSERTS, I mean why go to a Cheesecake Factory if you are not going to get CHEESECAKE(*DROOL!)!  My boyfriend and I can honestly say that we have explored almost all of the cheesecake selections. But my all-time favorite and what I'm super addicted to are their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake with a side of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream(MUST TRY) and their 30th Anniversary Cheesecake(SWEETGASM). The Red Velvet Cheesecake is great too but I'm a CHOCOHOLIC, so I gotta have CHOCOLATE on them. hehe. Dang, just thinking about those Cheesecake fus making me crave for a box full of cheesecake.

That's fair but what isn't fair is to quote a party 30 mins and have that wait time almost double! Upon arriving we were greeted and had our cell phone numbers taken so they can inform us (party of 2) when our table was ready. Decided to walk around the shops to kill time after 30 mins we checked in to see how much longer was told 10 mins then that turned to 20.. Just a mess. The service was terrible my friend ordered the nachos with beef instead of chicken requesting only meat and the cheese and the rest of the toppings on the SIDE! I ordered the macaroni burger both simple items came out 30 mins later just SLOW! My friends nachos were all wrong the movies probably could've provided better presentation for these nachos and on top of it all the added some sauce when we specifically asked for only meat and cheese!

Nova T.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,30,,3.0,10/12/2012,"You know when you see the word ""factory"" in the title of a restaurant, your`e in for an Orwellian nightmare, and this place does not disappoint in that respect. The wait staff ( mostly males) look like they were spawned specifically for the job. They all have the same scripted approach, same arched eyebrows, coiffed hairstyle and swagger to the point you can not tell them apart. That being said, they do try to offer courteous service, and the menu at this factory is pretty extensive, so there is bound to be something there for everyones palate ( with the exception of a couple of surprisingly tasty appetizers don`t expect it to be that much better than a few notches above fast food quality). I have never found their cheesecakes to be anything other than ordinary, some are downright awful- and most are doused in cheap processed whip cream which is a very amateurish ingredient to add to any dessert.(Fortunately for the factory, most people have never tasted real whipped cream) At any rate, Any grievances are quickly rectified by a very fast acting general manager who really does seem to want every patron to leave the place happy and satisfied. I`d give this place 5 stars for that category alone. The prices are fairly reasonable for what you get, too. Although, i`d never dine there for a real meal  because of the zombie carnival like atmosphere and mediocre food, i`ve found It`s worth slipping into this factorys bar area around 5 pm for their 5 dollar Happy Hour menu to grab a quick bite to eat after a matinee at the theaters next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=620

D S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,95,,2.0,9/26/2014,"Hard to be positive about Cheesecake.  The things that I used to enjoy or at least accept just aren't that acceptable anymore: 1) The bathroom's are very small.  This is ordinarily a small part of a restaurant experience, but consider the following: a large portion of the people at the Grove are families with small children.  Just go ahead and try washing your child's hands at the single sink in the men's room which they can't reach from the ground, so you have to hoist them up onto the counter.   But wait!   The counter is sopping wet.  So you have to spend a few seconds grabbing handfuls of paper towels to dry it off, or your child will have a wet bottom and things will really go downhill.  So you dry it off, only now the line of men waiting for the sink is growing by the minute.   So I madly try to wash my child's hands, but the only way to do this is one hand at a time, which basically doubles the time it takes.  The line grows longer, with silent looks of annoyance.  So you do the best job you can, a little hurried, but whatever, its ok, kids have dirty hands all the time, right? 2) The restaurant aisles are pretty narrow.  You live in constant fear that a waiter carrying 4 plates of steaming pasta is going to spill it all over your child in the high chair. 3) The food isn't that great.  The menu has about 400 items on it - common sense would dictate that no one can cook 400 items well.  So what you end up with are a bunch of pastas, salads, or deep fried items that are all pretty mediocre.  The only positive here is that the portions are large enough to give an elephant a heart attack.  So you'll have leftovers to feed your child the next day while you try and recover from eating at Cheesecake.  When I was younger I used to like this - but now, I really don't need all the extra mediocre calories. The bottom line - there is no reason to dine here, when the Farmer's Market is right around the corner, is cheaper, and just as noisy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=680

Our server could have gave us a quick check-in but he didn't. But I think they are extremely short staffed. And the server stopped by each neighboring table to serve drinks and take over and didn't once look up to see if we might need something. I understand he has his hands tied but management needs to have additional people walking by to check on tables for him or better train their servers. My sister's water cup is empty and no one offered to refill it yet. And my chicken strips are cold for waiting to get someone's attention to get my another dipping sauce. I'M SO ANGRY about it that I'm sitting her writing this review instead of eating the rest of my meal. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! No one has checked in on us even once!!

Service was good despite having been seated in a far off corner/nook. I always enjoy their pasta dishes. Had the one with farfalle, garlic cream sauce and chicken. It was delicious. Could only eat half and saved the rest for hubby's lunch for next day. Ordered the hot artichoke and spinach cheese dip as an appetizer per usual for us.

Juvi G.,"Pomona, CA",432,597,4354,5.0,11/13/2011,"I love coming to eat here with my family. The food is extremely delicious. They have such a diverse menu that I always have trouble choosing. Obviously they specialize in cheesecake, but they also have a large selection of soups, salads, sandwiches, and a little bit of everything in between. And their portions are nothing to scoff at, either. Although they do have healthy menu options, I would be hard pressed to show self-control if I came here and  was on a diet. Other than that, though, I can find nothing wrong with place. And the staff and waiters are also very friendly and attentive. If you've never been here before, (and aren't counting calories), I suggest trying the Kahlua Chocolate Cheesecake. It is decadence on a plate. Or if you're coming here for breakfast or brunch, you cannot go wrong with a Monte Cristo Sandwich.

My friend called in earlier they said they do not take reservations and the wait shouldn't be too long around 7pm. Oh boy, were they wrong! Once we got there they said 45-60 minutes. An hour and a half later and a glare from the front because- I'll admit-  I was pretty persistent in knowing how much longer it would take to get seated because I saw people who got their pagers after me get seated first, my party finally got a table! A bit cranky from the wait and unorganized chaos from the front of the house, our waitress was extremely welcoming and sweet. She took our order right away and brought them out very quickly! I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken. It was delicious! I ordered it with Penne pasta but it actually tastes better with the pasta it originally comes with. It had a creamy cheese sauce with peas, bacon and chicken (with extra cost). One of my friends ordered the Louisiana Chicken and the sauce was flavorful and light with fried chicken on top. Another friend ordered the Everything Pizza which had a variety of toppings. It was a bit salty and sweet. Overall, the food, service, and ambiance was nice. Food is overpriced and what you are really paying for is the experience. Only complaint is to get the front of the house more organized and set up a better system for helping customers because standing in a crowded messy line was pure chaos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=1020

When we left, she said bye and thank you, still with her face lit up. The food is kind of hit or miss. It's either really good, or just eh. Their pot pie and omelet were weird. Nachos are okay. Their sweet tamale appetizer is DELICIOUS, probably one of my favorite things there. Salads are good, pastas are good, and of course their CHEESECAKE is heavenly.

Of all the times that I've been (which, sadly, has been quite a few), I've been against my will. There is always SOMEONE in the party who for SOME reason, wants to go to the Cheesecake factory when we are at the Grove. There's a perfectly fine Cheesecake factory which serves the SAME food in Brentwood (sooo much closer to where most of us live) but does anyone ever want to go to that one? No. And why not? Because they don't make you wait a lifetime just so you can get a seat.  I mean, the food is good and I LOVE their cheesecakes (mmmm...the white chocolate macadamia or whatever-the-ever-seven-words-in-the-name cheesecake.....) but is the food WORTH the wait? I mean, it's a CHAIN restaurant after all. Like I said, I can get it in Brentwood...YOU can probably get it somewhere else too. I like the Cheesecake factory...just not the one at the Grove!

We stuck it out in hopes of having a great meal. It was far from that. Seating was poor, with a friend of our sitting in the aisle in a chair since the booth was too small for all of us and when we complained they said it would another 3O mins, so we dealt with it. My food was mediocre. I ordered the pasta brocolini, which was pasta with italian sausage, brocolli, asparagus and tomatoe. It was so greasy, the bottom of my plate was filled with grease from the sausage. The sausage was not even cut evenly it looked like something you would feed your dog. Big and small uneven chunks. I didn't complain because there were people at the table I had just met and I did not want to make a bitchy impression. Now, my stomache hurts mainly becuase of all the grease.

Karen W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,30,,2.0,4/26/2012,"This gets a two star rating because the grilled cheese was amazing or this would be a one star rating.

So it comes out plain without cheese, he asks the waiter to put cheese on it, he does, and it's a slice of ice cold cheese. It also took so long that the meat got half cold and the sourdough roll, though flavorful, had more in common with a rock than it did actual bread. The waiter wasn't very good, but the staff who wasn't serving us--the girl who brought us our bill, the girl who sat us, and the man at the front desk--were all quite nice.

Audrey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,69,77,3.0,7/29/2013,"This was only about my third or fourth time eating at the Cheesecake Factory, despite having lived ten minutes away for my whole life. As a large national chain restaurant, I feel it's quite overhyped, but it does have its advantages. I tried to organize the pros and cons from my limited Cheesecake experiences: PROS 1. professional and friendly service. excellent, especially for a large corporation chain. they cater to your preferences as best they can; I once asked for a different type of pasta in my dish and they were very open to substitutions/requests.  2. the free unlimited bread. I personally like the white french bread with olive oil and butter (the waiter will give you the olive oil if you ask), but many of my friends prefer the slightly sweeter brown bread.  3. the wide variety of food for a relatively decent price. steaks, pastas, salads, soups, desserts -- there are almost too many options.  CONS 1. can be a long wait. avoid mealtimes and you'll be able to get in within half an hour or so.  2. very dark inside. my eyes always hurt from straining to see my food and the faces of the people I'm speaking with. may make for an intimate setting with a date, but not really apt for large parties or families. 3. the extensive menu does include some faulty dishes; it's a hit or miss type of thing. here are the ones i've tried and still remember: Steak Diane - good beef with a good mushroom sauce, tastes superb cooked medium rare.  Shrimp Scampi - large shrimp with a slight crunch in a citrus, garlic sauce  Chicken lettuce wraps - nothing special, just some chicken and vegetables wrapped in lettuce with a sauce commonly found in Mexican places. my mom really likes them; they're meant to be appetizers, but can serve as a light meal. the lettuce adds a nice refreshing crunch when you're not ordering salad. Spicy chicken chipotle pasta - not spicy at all, actually sort of sweet. the sauce gets cold pretty quickly, and you're left with a clumpy mess of a dish.  Jambalaya pasta - the spices' balance is pretty good, but gets cold and nasty quickly as well. I don't recommend the pasta dishes here.  Original cheesecake - very good; after all, they get their name from this signature dish.  Tiramisu cheesecake - DIDN'T HAVE A GRAHAM CRUST!! i felt cheated. the tiramisu cake part was merely eh, and the cheesecake part wasn't as superb as the original cheesecake. the chocolate mousse/whipped cream on top made the dessert extremely decadent and sweet. I would stick to the basic cheesecake.  Sundae - got a free sundae on my birthday; there was only a spoonful of extremely sweet vanilla ice cream buried under a LOT of whipped cream and sitting on top of black chocolate fudge. it was free, but didn't feel like a big deal.                                               Sides - tried the fries, salad, and mashed potatoes; all are decent. just some of my thoughts on a much reviewed restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=760

Rebecca P.,"Seattle, WA",241,761,95,1.0,9/30/2011,"Okay, unless you're getting the cheesecake or have friends who lack taste buds and wish to have dinner, go elsewhere. By all means, you won't get sick or anything, but I would venture elsewhere given the price and quality of the food.  I arrived with a rather large group of semi-family visiting from the areas around Los Angeles, presenting the Grove as a midway meet-up. We all ordered what sounded like wonderful dishes, taking the advice of our server when needed. After a reasonable wait, our dishes came out, a seeming panoply of American gluttony (and steaming goodness). Now, as a large group, one might decrease their expectations of the quality of the food, given that it's difficult to serve big masses. But, given that we were paying for entrees in the upper teens, I expected a bit more than monotony. Specifically, everything somewhat tasted the same. My dish of the chicken madeira ($17.50, recommended by the server as ""the most popular chicken dish"") failed to please. It was extremely salty, and after about three bites, nearly everything tasted the same--my chicken, the potatoes, the asparagus, etc. So, I nibbled off my neighbors' plates to try to cut the monotony and found that their food (lemon herb roasted chicken, $16.95, and four cheese pasta, $13.95) was quite mediocre and homogeneous in flavor as well.  The ambiance, however, was fine. A bit loud, but bustling with energy and surrounded by a fun outdoor area (the Grove). And, as mentioned, the cheesecake is good. Not as amazing as the cheesecake I got growing up from this little hole-in-the-wall in upstate New York, but better than most places on this coast. So, at least they put their money where their mouth, living up to their name--and almost making me bump my rating up to a 2... almost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=760

Charlene W.,"West Hollywood, CA",88,82,,2.0,6/8/2012,"My friend took me and a friend  here for our birthdays. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a few years. My joke is I never actually get cheesecake because the portions are so huge that there is no room for dessert and today was no exception.   Fried Zucchini was yummy but the zucchini seemed a little undercooked. One friend had ice water but it was way more ice than water so we had to remove the ice and put it on the bread plate and remind whoever was refilling to chill (ha! get it!?! I made a pun) on the ice. I had the chicken enchiladas...they were just ""meh"".  I was drinking soda water with lime and one of the staff just assumed I was drinking Sprite so that was gross when I tasted my watered down Sprite expecting plain soda water. My friend seemed to like her salad (can't remember which one she got) and my other friend liked the samosas. They sang happy birthday to us (which is horrifying to me but my other friend loved it) and gave us a wee little dessert which was unexpected and nice.

However not when I came to this location for the first time late on a Monday evening.  We walked in and requested a booth, and one magically opened up for us immediately!  Nice! We both knew that we wanted a ribeye, and STAT because we were starving.  So instead of searching through the book that is their menu, we asked our server for a recommendation when took our drink orders.  She pointed out the ribeye on the menu, and we were SOLD - that was easy! Or so we thought..... A few minutes after we placed our orders, she came back to tell us that they had just sold out of their last ribeye.  Seriously??  On a Monday night?? What we ended up getting was fine, but after anticipating a ribeye, this was somewhat of a booby prize: Filet Mignon - served with steamed broccoli and a couple of onion rings (not strings, as it originally says) it was fine.  But to me, this cut is just not as flavorful due to the lack of marbling.  It did satisfy my need for meat though! Carne Asada Skirt Steak - served with rice, beans, choice of corn or flour tortillas, and sour cream/salsa/guac.  The steak was tender and flavored with a slightly sweet marinade, and my friend liked it a lot.  I ate the sour cream and guac : P. We couldn't resist dessert, so we got: Key Lime Cheesecake - really good, limey tart-sweet cheesecake! Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake - OMG YUM!  A pineapple-y cheesecake layer between layers of Pineapple Upside Down cake - texturally SUPER moist and creamy all together, and separately delicious.  This was a dessert that I could have eaten a barrel full of had my thighs not screamed for mercy!   We had also ordered decafs with dessert, but when they never arrived we asked our server if we were getting any.  She looked at us without so much as a hint of recognition and said, sure - she'd bring some.  By that point, we were done with dessert so we changed our minds an declined as soon as we asked for it.  It still would have been nice to see a flicker of a memory of our order however : /. Cheesecake Factory in general is very good - so yes, I'd come back if seating happened this quickly again.  I just hope they have more ribeyes next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=760

Jeffrey K.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,290,20,2.0,3/14/2012,"I came to Cheesecake Factory for my mom's birthday with my family. After a ridiculous 45 minute wait on a freakin Thursday, we were finally seated.  It took an extremely long time for the waiter to take our order, but it seemed like he tried his best to give us some attention. This place looked very busy. So after a 45 minute wait, we waited 20 minutes for our order to be taken, and then another 25 minutes for our food to come out. So an hour and a half wait to eat. Most of my family and I ordered pasta. I ordered the special jambalaya, which was decent. My fatty side loves all of the meat in it and it was huge. The downside of the pasta was it's lack of spice and flavor. There wasn't as much flavor I'd hoped for in the pasta. Some of the other pastas I tried had the same exact problem. A lot of meat, a lot of pasta, but not much sauce. The appetizers were okay as well. All in all, it was a decent dinner, with a ridiculously long wait. Without the wait, I'd probably give it 3 stars, but the wait was so atrocious especially on a Thursday, that I can not see how people think Cheesecake Factory is worth it for the price and wait.

This time I got the cobb salad.  It was underwhelming, but big.  I substituted sharp white cheddar for blue cheese, and I wish I had gotten mozzarella instead.   The spinach artichoke starter was only mediocre.  It wasn't salty enough.  It was cheesy and oozing, but a little oily and lacking flavor. The boyfriend got some fried and breaded chicken cutlets with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  That was delicious.  I think I'll try getting that next time.

The wait time was ridiculous for 2 so we went upstairs to see if we could get bar seating. As we're waiting for something to open up, a manager looking lady asked us if we were waiting for a bar table and was super nice about it. She then literally asked this couple to leave who apparently had been sitting there for hours. Our waitress kinda made that whole encounter happen but I was super impressed and grateful that a chain like this would do such a nice thing.  I ordered the Cheesecake Factory chardonnay by Mondavi, avacado eggrolls, and the skinnylicious flatbread. The wine was great and nicely priced. The eggrolls are always amazing and I felt like the portions were bigger than what I remembered (a plus fo sho). Surprisingly, I got stuffed from all the food. I couldn't even finish the flatbread which was pretty small.  Our waitress was super chill and accommodating.

Let me get this out of the way and mention the cheesecake. It's good, so, so good. But I would say that about most cheesecakes regardless of the vendor. Still, cheesecake. I typically order the crispy beef which hasn't disappointed me yet. Some of their other stuff can be very hit and miss, such as the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which used to be my go-to dish. I've seen lots of reviews for the miso salmon so I'm definitely going to try that next, which will probably be this weekend.  Unfortunately, the wait here seems more ridiculous than other places so plan accordingly. You can only spend so much time at the equally ridiculously crowded Apple store across the way or you probably get through quite a few books at the Barnes and Noble next door.  The decor, food and service is pretty consistent across all of their stores although we had a less than enjoyable experience at this particular spot when we went for lunch.

Our server suggested I get the half order and she was right on. It was huge, it was delish and still at a half order, I ended up taking half of it home. My two friends both ordered the Chinese Chicken Salads. Both were unhappy and agreed that the salads were dry and bland; the dressing had no flavor to it, and would NOT recommend. I took a bite and actually agree, the salad was pretty gross.  As for cocktails, order doubles if you wanna get your buzz on, otherwise you might as well save the $12 per drink. Our drinks were completely watered down and it took our server over 20 minutes each time to get our drinks out. I could semi-understand if we ordered a Mojito or something blended, but we ordered your basic 2 ingredient cocktails. STAY AWAY from their Long Island Iced Tea.

I always get the  alfredo fettuccini without chicken and sun-dried tomatoes...it's so creamy. Freshly grated Parmesan cheese takes it to the next level. The four cheese pasta is also good but not what i expected. Just picture spaghetti with loads of cheese. Another delicious pasta dish is the spicy chicken chipotle pasta without the chicken of course. It has a tang to it, a crunch(tortilla strips) and a spicy edge. As for appetizers, fried macaroni and cheese, so   it off with a strawberry or raspberry lemonade!Can't believe i've been here dozens of times and never had cheesecake..ha ha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=1060

They give you a lot, but it's not the best quality. I definitely taste a lot of artificial ingredients and non-fresh elements, or just factory made food like their fried foods, not fresh tortilla.  I like the jambalaya, it's quite good. The Godiva sundae is good too. I had this at another location and everyone was staring because it's a very pretty presentation. The eggplant burger is a miss. Didn't like the texture of the eggplant, too mushy.  Their saving grace is their service. I have to admit, they have pretty good waiters. The wait sucks, but it's not like you can't do anything while waiting, there are plenty of stores around.  I say their cheesecakes are overrated and that you would be better of going to a specialty store for real cheesecake. I will probably get bashed for saying it, but I don't really dig their cheesecakes. Too sweet and way too much topping/cream. Just american style I suppose.

Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks, Beverly Hills, Glendale .. etc. And honestly I've never had bad service like this one.  First when we entered we were not greeted nicely, the 2 people up front were not friendly at all and not presentable either. We were ""greeted"" by a girl named Michelle, tattoos all over her, I mean nothing against that if you have a nice friendly attitude to balance it out but when you're mean looking and you're actually mean .. that art work does not help you at all. She asked how many people, i immediately felt a little rushed and just intimidated by her tone so I quickly responded with 2 she answered back with ""its going to be 15 min"" .. then I quickly said I'm sorry I meant to say 2 adults and a baby, she rolled her eyes and said ""THATS 3 people it's going to be 20 minutes"" I said ok that's fine, is it faster if we seat out door, she responds with ""thats an additional 15"" all with an attitude and a rude tone. Whatever .. we decided to stay and wait Bc it wasn't busy and wait wasn't long, any other day I would've probably not tolerated that kind of attitude specially as a good customer who goes to cheesecake on a weekly basis literally. So we get called to get seated, we get an outside table????? But did she not say it was going to be an additional 15? Okay well, we get seated around 5pm, ordered our drinks and food, didn't get our appetizer til almost 45 min later, our main entree we did not get until an hour later ??? Looking around and ppl who were seated after us received their food before us ? To top it off My food wasn't great at all, I get the same thing every time, the chicken pieces were super small, the sauce was watery with no flavor and my food was warm almost cold. Then right after the waitress serves our food, not even taking the first bite, she brings out the check???? Really guys? Idk but I'm so disappointed. Not happy. Not satisfied. And it's too bad Bc i was starving, hadn't had lunch and I was really looking forward to a great meal at my fav place.

The Godiva chocolate and fruit flavors are my favorite!

Kasey Kimberly S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,1.0,2/8/2015,"Stay away on the weekends! It was my choice to wait an hour for a table then another 15-20 minutes for a booth. My friend and I both knew what we were ordering. From the time our order was taken it took 1 hour 20 for our food to hit the table! We were offered comp salad or soup at 58 minutes which we turned down. Her food was fine , my  pork chop was over cooked and dry but I wasn't sending it back!they need to hire more cooks to get the food out if they are going to seat that many people. When I lleft I discovered I had to pay $8 for parking because even with validation I wasn't covered. The server was embarrassed and when he came and told us he was taking his dinner break I recommended he eat elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=640
Bryan B.,"San Francisco, CA",79,357,149,5.0,9/22/2010,"This place gets five stars for the awesome location, generous parking, and the fact they didn't ruin my birthday and actually ... made it kinda awesome. Came in with a party of 10 (was kinda iffy because I know Cheescake Factory doesn't take reservations) and was quoted 45 minutes. We were okay with that because there's lots to see and do at The Grove. Left two phone numbers (I knew I'd miss the call so my friend luckily got it), and 15 minutes later, we were seated because of some cancellations. I don't know if I should credit this to the service or to birthday luck but I was happy as hell anyway. Got a nice table, the food was delicious as usual (got the Cajun Jambalaya) but also tried the Chipotle Pasta something, artichoke dip, and some meatloaf/pot roast dish with BOMB MASHED POTATOES. You know the birthday boy had to sample a little bit of everything. Ate two bites of my food to save room for CHEESECAKE. I mean, the place is called CHEESECAKE factory, how can you not get cheesecake? It's like going to KFC and not getting chicken. The Red Velvet Cheesecake is a CONSISTENT WINNER but I also tried the white chocolate raspberry and vanilla cheesecake and they were just as good. You really can't go wrong with their cheesecake selection. Aside from the piece of shrimp I stupidly flung into my eye that made it swell up like Rihanna's (I'm allergic), it was a great night. Don't forget to validate your parking ticket on the way out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=640

The menu is huge ranging from pretty much everything.  I usually get the portebello burger which is Delicious but my sister says it's too greasy.   Of course if you come to the cheesecake factory you have to get cheesecake.  I love fresh strawberry and the white chocolate raspberry truffle but really all the cheesecakes are good.

Julia L.,"San Francisco, CA",793,318,508,5.0,8/2/2010,"5 star because of one awesome server named Rene R.  He was absolutely fabulous!  He was so good, I went home & wrote Corporate to tell them the following: ""I am contacting you to let you know of exceptional service we received tonight at The Cheesecake Factory located at The Grove in Los Angeles, CA.  It's my birthday tomorrow and my cousin, her boyfriend and my mom decided to have dinner with me a day early.  We decided on this location as it was the closest & we love the menu. Rene R was our waiter tonight (Check #0583 - Table #51 - SvrCk #6 @ 19:04 on 8/2/10).  He is one superb employee!  He greeted us with a smile.  Friendly & knowledgeable.  Helpful and attentive.  My mom ordered hot water w/ lemon.  On his own, half way through the meal, he brought another mug of hot water w/ lemon wedges on the side.  We didn't even ask for a refill.  Same for the waters.  Same for the bread.  He was busy but never too busy to keep checking in on us. He recommended the lemon herb roasted chicken for me & it was delicious! Just the way he served us as well as the other tables around us, I turned to my mom & said, he could be a waiter at a 5-star high end restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, we love The Cheesecake Factory.  But the last time I got that kind of service @ any of your locations was...never.  And I've been going to this chain for over 15 years now. If anything, he reminded me of Stu @ Bix in San Francisco.  Or Mrs. Dwyer @ Lawry's Beverly Hills.  I remember servers' names if they impress me with their great service.  If possible, I'll definitely be asking to be seated in his area again. I hope you guys keep Rene for a long time and move him onto the Managerial track.  A lot of your other waiters/waitresses could do with a bit of training of Rene style service! Thank you for hiring him and making my b'day dinner a very pleasant surprise!"" Yeah yeah - so I gushed - but hey!  If management ever needs to check his personnel files, here's one nice customer compliment in his favor, right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=820
Kali K.,"Los Angeles, CA",211,160,156,4.0,5/19/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory=Happy times. :-) Does it ever differ? Not really.  This is a plus for the chain. As far as I've seen, there isn't one 'shady' CF & another dripping w/ glitz. They are--to the chain's credit--uniform; service is friendly across the board.  Petit Filet Mignon is well-prepped, & the accompanying french fries are duly soaked in culinary juices. Mmmm. ((stomach growling)) Dessert? Who has room? But it's a MUST.  You just don't go to a place like the CF & not get the obligatory hunk o' cake. It defeats the purpose; you could've gone to a steakhouse if you merely wanted tasty chops.  You came here for the extensive cake menu!  You know... the Reeses Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake, Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake. (I can't breathe!) Just get your lard-laden buns to the CF, & worry about booking a double appointment w/ your trainer tomorrow. Your midsection won't kill you!

I just had a baby three months ago and was looking forward to a much needed outing with a few other mom friends. I understand that during busy hours they could pose a fire hazard but at the time we arrived the place was half empty. It was really more the ATTITUDE we got from the hostess regarding their policy. I have spent thousands of dollars dining at CCF over the years. This one experience has seriously left a bad taste in my mouth and I honestly doubt if I will ever go back.

Angela W.,"Los Angeles, CA",106,57,272,4.0,5/25/2014,"I wasn't a fan of Cheesecake Factory until I dined at this particular location at The Grove. I love their menu because it offers homey favorites and finer dishes for a fair price.  Alongside that, I could order the White Chicken Chili one hundred times, and each time, I can almost guarantee that the chef will prepare and cook the dish precisely the same way. As a chain, Cheesecake Factory relies on this sense of menu familiarity with their patrons. For me, this kind of consistency is key when deciding on regular dining spots, as in, I am confident that everything on the menu tastes just as I expect it to no matter what day of the week. Not only that, the outdoor balcony seating is terrific and the staff is always very accommodating and friendly.  I do sometimes get annoyed by the cover artist music selection and the indoor lighting is sometimes TOO dark to see the plate in front of you. This place is always popular, so if they could develop a reservation system in the future, that may be helpful. Regardless, the food is the main component for me, and for that, I enjoy dining here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=820

But last night I came here for a birthday and decided to try something other than a ho-hum salad or burger.  First, I ordered the Well Mannered Martini, which was a dirty Ketel One martini that was made perfectly. Our party of 15 was already talking about the avocado rolls before we got there so we ended up ordering 3 plates of it.  They turned out to be pretty fucking amazing if you like big tasty chunks of avo. For my main course, I split a bowl of the Thai Chicken Pasta.  It could have used some kick, but I enjoyed it so much that I finally now have a reason to return.

When you grow accustomed to unique, home-cooked style food, a place like Cheesecake Factory doesn't cut it anymore. But in comparison to my other Cheesecake Factory experiences... It seems to be a place that's all about how much you get rather than what you get. I got a Chicken Caesar salad that seemed quite bland.  The decor of this place and placement of tables in this place appears to be lacking. It feels more about stuffing people in than letting people relax as we were seated right next to the escalator where people go up. Anytime there's a spot for people who aren't eating to watch you eat... that's a big turn off for any restaurant.  It's not bad enough to qualify as two stars, but it's not great either.

The service is great. The decor and ambience standard of any Cheesecake Factory. The food was good too. We started off with the chicken samosas appetizer and bf ordered a Blue Moon while I got the iced green tea. The chicken samosas are good (especially the first bite), but they get too salty after a while. They come with a dipping sauce that was pretty good. I was expecting samosa wrap, but it was more like a wrap on an egg roll. It was still good. The iced green tea is amazing! It's so refreshing with a sprig of mint. It feels so fresh and clean! The bf ordered a chargrilled steak medium rare plus while I got the cajun jambalaya pasta. The steak was delicious. It melted in your mouth. The pasta was good as usual. The pasta was cooked a little more than al dente, but it was good. I liked how it wasn't all dry-- some cheesecakes make this dish a little dry. Instead, the chicken was so moist and the whole dish was not dry at all! So good! Coming back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-3?start=820

Oh I used to like their white chocolate raspberry latte but it's not on the menu anymore... I like their food even though it's like chain restaurant. Oh, last time, they forgot our crab cake appetizers and the manager gave it to us for free. So nice right? But then another time, their service was super slow and like practically non existent. Oh and another time I forgot to print out the coupon for free cheesecake for every $30 spent, and the manager came and said it's ok cos I showed him the email on my new iPad haha. So basically, the service is up and down, but the food is good. I wish they would open this franchise in hong kong, cos i'll be moving there soon. And.

I have come many times to this Cheesecake Factory as well as many others and this by far was the worst experience! First it started fine with drinks and bread but then quickly went downhill. The waiter brought out the child's meal first which would've been fine if she was 3 but she's 10. Then we waited at least another 10 minutes before our meal came and no appetizer insight! We asked about the appetizer and our waiter Jesus responded "" I only have 2 hands"" and someone's following me. Which of course there was no one. We asked why they brought the kids meal so far in advance from ours and he said "" I thought that's what you would want"". Hmmm., how about asking?  Then eventually we got our appetizer which was missing  a main ingredient and no spoon which we had to wait for and ask for. It was just all around bad. When we decided to say something to the waiter he was very nonchalant and not all concerned.  We even complained to the manager and all he did was comp the appetizer. Not enough!! Also I so how the waiter catered to the people ordering more like cocktails, dessert and coffee, etc. Still even after we paid the waiter never asked how everything was. That really says at all!!
