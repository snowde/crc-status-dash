Jason C.,"Floyds Knobs, IN",0,158,62,4.0,10/20/2017,Very good chain restaurant.  Menu variety. Good service. Very good food. I had the jambalaya Cajun pasta with chicken. Wife had 3 taco with seared tuna. I'll add the pics. Prices seem a little high but probably comparable to other restaurants of this kind. But the portions are huge. I will have lunch leftover today. Also the Oreo cheesecake is 5 star. We come here about every three months.  Satisfied every time.  Updating review. Ate here last night. One of our favorite chain restaurants. Food and service were very good. See pics. Only thing about chain restaurants is you get some loud people in sometime who think they are at home    Also wine per glass is as much as some of the fancy restaurants. Otherwise this place is always an option for us!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville
Robert S.,"Palm Beach, FL",13,78,13,3.0,1/13/2018,"I wish I had perfect words for this legacy restaurant. However the foods I've ordered and requested low sodium have been off the last few times.  Maybe they just can't alter the recipes to make them taste good without loading then up with salt, salt and then more salt...   The service was spot on with an adorable young server that my wife and I remarked to her that she is a super star and is headed places in her life (an accounting major working her way through college) She won our heart but the food didn't.  Bottom line... don't even think about going here if you're trying to eat healthy for the new year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville
Morgan E.,"Louisville, KY",86,149,61,3.0,11/21/2017,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory on many different occasions and each time I'm reminded why I rarely go there.  What fun is it to wait nearly an hour to eat over-priced, mediocre food with inconsistent service?  I don't blame the cooks at the Cheesecake Factory.  I think when you have a menu with over a hundred items on it - it's hard to make dishes stand out.  So everything I've ever had on the menu has just been...okay.  I've never ordered anything a second time if that says anything.   At my most recent trip I had the Jamaican chicken and shrimp.  It was fine - but it was barely warm when it came to the table and the rice was hard.  However, I liked the spice on the dish and the marinated pineapple was a nice touch.  Our server - well, she just couldn't be bothered.  It took several minutes for her to approach the table and another ten minutes to get our waters.  She wasn't friendly or engaging.  She didn't smile.  She wasn't necessarily rude, but not exactly a good representative of the company.   Alright, let's talk what is good and the only reason this place gets three stars - and it's the cheesecake.  They have a huge variety of cheesecake ranging from plain Jane, strawberry, vanilla, Oreo, red velvet cake, snickers, Godiva chocolate, and the list goes on and on.  I used to be a huge fan of the holiday cheesecake - pumpkin pecan cheesecake.  However, the last two times I've ordered it - it tasted of bitter, old pecans.  The pecans that you let go rancid and then they had a nasty aftertaste.  Yeah, those.  But I've had red velvet, carrot cake, vanilla bean, Godiva, and raspberry lemon with all good results.   Bottom line - with so many wonderfully amazing restaurants in Louisville, the Cheesecake Factory just can't hang.  I suggest skipping the food because it's simply not worth it.  They have a counter where you can order cheesecake slices to go.  That's your best bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville

Michelle W.,"Louisville, KY",31,72,136,3.0,9/1/2017,"I've been to this cheesecake factory twice, the first time the food was not impressive at all but the cheesecake was delicious, and the second time the food was amazing and I didn't end up getting dessert. It is the only location I've ever been, but I'm really not crazy about going to such a lovely restaurant in the mall... just my personal preference. I sort of figure if I'm paying those types of prices I would rather have the experience that goes with it, which is hard to do in a mall parking lot. The inside really is quite pretty and since they have such an interesting variety of foods on their menu of definitely be willing to try it again, especially when I'm in the mood for tasty cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville
Kaitlyn C.,"Lyndon, Louisville, KY",20,50,33,2.0,8/15/2017,This location is okay... it's almost funny how they are always out of what we want to order. EVEN ON A TUESDAY NIGHT. The service is great but the food is just meh. We ordered chunky avocado with a 1/4 teaspoon of tuna (TUNA tar tar) for $8 and mushy crab balls for $8 (CRISPY crab bites). The portions and names of the food are hilariously inaccurate. The drinks are great and so is the cheesecake!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville
Vien L.,"Saint Matthews, KY",44,143,328,1.0,4/30/2017,"I'm not too much of a fan of big chain restaurants. I feel they've let me down far too many times at this point. The first was Wolfgang Puck, then TGI Friday's, and now ol' Cheesecake Factory. I hate writing bad reviews. I like having good food.  We started with appetizers and were considering how expensive everything is. Should be good right? For what I'm paying for? Quality and tasty food? It let me down. I had a great time here because I came with fantastic company. But the grub was not up to standard. I can make a much better meal from pantry items on the fly. We started with stuffed mushrooms, and the firecracker salmon. The stuffed mushrooms were decent. No real complaint there I suppose. A bit greasy but tasty nonetheless. Now the firecracker salmon was another story. I have to show you and let you decide. Considering what we expected versus what we received... it was a strong fail. Just by the looks of it. Greasy, disproportional portions and oh so sloppy. I thought our waitress just didn't carry it over straight, so the dish just slid to one side. Then there was the chicken pasta da Vinci. It was just plain pasta noodles with some mushrooms and some chicken. Now this is where I swear I can do better with pantry items. One box of pasta cooked al dente. One can of campbells cream of mushroom and a half can of water. Some fresh whole mushrooms sliced up and sautéed in butter and a bit of salt... And some chicken. Any chicken. Even canned chunk chicken drained and rinsed. Cook it up and serve it. It would be more flavorful than this pasta dish at Cheesecake Factory, and less greasy. It just wasn't very flavorful. And the amount of chicken and mushrooms in my dish was pitiful. For the price, it could've had a garden salad or something thrown in. I feel like I ate unhealthy food, and yet it wasn't rewarding... like a dirty food truck taco would've been a better way to go than this faux fancy place.  There are so many restaurateurs in Louisville at a similar price point. I just don't see the point in spending so much and getting so little in return. Plus, I didn't feel a whole lot of love from our waitress. The cheesecake was good though. One star for that! I won't be back though. I want a good pasta place in Louisville... one that makes the pasta in house. If I was by myself, I might've sent a dish back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville
Jason H.,"New Albany, IN",65,61,33,3.0,3/14/2017,"Prepare to spend a long time here - not necessarily because service is slow, but their expansive menu takes time to read and digest. My main issue is with so many options how do you choose? In addition, they tend to be hit or miss. The American options are really good, but the Chinese and Mexican options are sub par. My most recent visit was with a large group of about 15. I ordered the Steak Diane and it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly, the sauce added a ton of flavor and the mashed potatoes were really good. In addition, I was able to sample a number of appetizers. The crab dip was not very good. It had a very fishy taste and was pretty bland tasting. No one liked it. The spinach dip had an overwhelmingly taste of spinach, which some people like. I was not a fan. The chicken blast were awesome. Probably the highlight of our lunch. Basically, they take buffalo chicken dip and then they fry it. Served with a delicious buffalo sauce and ranch. Lastly, we had the loaded/stuffed tots. Tater tots stuffed with a loaded baked potato. Also very good (especially with the spicy mayo). Everyone's entree looked good. I can't wait to go back and try the mac and cheese burger. The fish and shrimp tacos both received praise and I would like to try these as well. As noted above, stay away from the burritos and the orange chicken dishes. The main draw is of course dessert. I was able to sample a variety of cheesecake and they were all phenomenal. I don't remember the names, but the salted caramel was good as was the lemon raspberry. Our group also had a Reese's, some kind of chocolate turtle, and a chocolate blonde. One server cared for our group of 15 and she did a great job balancing the group with her other tables. Our drinks were refreshed at the halfway point nearly every time. Empty dishes were promptly removed to make space for the next items All in all, this place is great for dessert, but just OK for lunch and dinner. Prices are a little high for what you get. I would recommend for a date night or some kind of occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville
Mark V.,"Grand Rapids, MI",20,204,8,2.0,9/5/2017,Not a good experience. Harassed by flies at my table and a dirty water glass. The Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai was not good at all. The saving grace was my Celebration Cheesecake and the waiter. I was not really happy with third place and was pretty shocked at the lack of cleanliness of my table and the before mention items.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville
Matt T.,"Mt Washington, KY",0,5,,3.0,12/9/2017,Very slow service. There was 4 of us for a simple birthday dinner and we we there over 2 hours. In addition the food did not come out together.  My son's food had to be remade because another server took his to another table. Plus I find it strange that I have to explain how to make an Irish coffee. Really?? Probably won't return unless I'm forced to. That much money I can find better choices. Oh yeah! They were out of her bed chicken so we had to find a substitute which was sub-par.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville
Elizabeth C.,"Waddy, KY",20,260,585,4.0,8/26/2016,"Any fan of The Big Bang Theory knows The Cheesecake Factory features prominently in the series... And, things like the enormous size of the establishment's menu are sometimes discussed.  Having never been to one before, when we found one on our recent trip to Kentucky, we just HAD TO go! It was after noon on a Saturday and the place was HOPPING.  We had a rather large party, so it was a bit of a wait for a table, but, to be honest, they told us 15 minutes, and it didn't take more than 5.  This allowed us ample time to drool over their Cheesecake display... which is dangerously extensive!  In addition, and I'm not sure if all Cheesecake Factories look alike, but, the decor in this one was an entertainment in itself.  It seriously looked like it belonged in Vegas! Once seated, they were quick to bring us our drink orders and VERY understanding after we sent them away twice so we could read through the book, and I do mean BOOK, that is their menu.  The jokes are true folks... their menu is crazy.  You can pretty much find anything you might be craving... This too, was my first experience with ordering beverages in Kentucky, which was a 2 fold learning experience...   #1 - They do eveything big here and drinks are no exception.  I'm used to having to practically beg for a tiny glass of water everywhere I go in California, but here... they mean business.  You want water?  You get a GIANT glass!   #2 - Sweet Tea versus Unsweet Tea.  If you order Iced Tea, there's a slight assumption you mean Sweet Tea... If you want what I call Iced Tea... you have to order Unsweet Tea.  Not a big deal, just took my brain a little bit of getting used to.  Also, I had a sip of some sweet tea and damn, do they mean it!  So, if you don't want to drink tea flavored sugar water, you might want to pass!  And, since they make Tea sweet, I don't think they get that people might want to sweeten it themselves because there never seemed to be packets of sugar or sweetener anywhere we went... I never ordered coffee, but maybe they bring you some then? Ok, I digress.  We all ordered something different and I will say, despite service being friendly, and them refilling our ginormous drinks promptly whenever we drank 1/2 the glass, no matter what we ordered, the food took FOREVER.  We were later told that Well Done burgers take a minimum of 20 minutes to cook.  Odd.. but... ok...  Since a number of us ordered burgers, we were the hold up?  Also, true to form, everyone at the table was served, except for my husband, despite him ordering what was arguably the simplest thing at the table... We're not sure why, but this happens to him... a lot!  And, once his food DID arrive they brought it out in stages... which consequently meant he got an extra side dish...  I guess that made up for him having to watch us all eat for 5 minutes? I ordered a Mac & Cheese Burger because I'd had one at a posh joint in Denver and was pretty disappointed.  I was curious if a chain like The Cheesecake Factory could improve on it, and do it cheaper... and boy, did they!  It was arguably the cheesiest burger I've ever had.  I had subbed in a side of Sweet Potato Fries and those were excellent as well.  A friend of ours at the table had never had Sweet Potato fries and I guess the ones at Cheesecake Factory made him a believer, because he's ordering them everywhere now! Everyone seemed to enjoy their choices and we were all stuffed... which was kind of a bummer... I wanted Cheesecake!  Then again... how could you ever choose what kind to try?!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville
Breonna L.,"Tampa, FL",280,228,155,3.0,1/3/2017,"Ehhhh, I've been to a lot of Cheesecake factories and while this one isn't terrible, its not amazing either. It's literally okay... average... basic. Since I'm swearing off junk food for an entire month, I decided my last fatty meal should be cheesecake factory. So we arrive, parking is ridiculous as St Matthews tends to be during the holidays (no stars knocked off for this). There was a 40 minute wait at cheesecake factory which is normal (again, no stars knocked off for this). They handed us one of those devices that vibrate when your table is ready (I don't know the name!) and we sat down. About 35 minutes later, we hear ""table of Lewis, party of 4"" so we go up there.  We get up there and they say ""ohh.... it must of been 2 parties of Lewis for 4 because someone already came up here. We gave your table to the wrong party""   First of all, whats the point of those vibrating devices if they aren't being used and secondly, the devices have numbers on them. Couldn't of you just checked their number?! Anyway, my mom makes a big fuss so they sit up promptly.  So once we are seated, I ordered the mac n cheese burger and carrot cake. My burger was okay. Honestly, for it to be my last junk food meal of the year... it kinda sucked lol. The burger was so flavorless. I order burgers from cheesecake factory all the time (in other locations) and they always taste great. This burger was missing some seasoning. I feel like anything I eat at this specific cheesecake factory, its never consistent.  Would I come back? Probably... its not horrible. Would I be the one to pick this place out when there are so many better places nearby? Probably No.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville

Christopher S.,"Louisville, KY",202,565,1397,3.0,8/21/2016,"I really enjoy this place but sometimes I'm frightened of it, to be honest. Basically, this place is 'okay' and in Louisville you need to put a good foot forward with so many independent places.   First, it's super large and loud.  It's usually hard to hear the person you're eating with.  I don't get to eat with other human beings often so I want to also have a conversation with them.  The interior design is garish and distracting.   Their food is okay - it's good but not, ""OMG"" or any conjugation of amazing.  It's what you expect and since it's uniform from sea to shining see I'm pretty sure it comes out of a freezer.   Also, their cheesecake selection is why we come here.  It's a lot of fun.  There are too many choices which is never a bad thing at dessert.  I like the cheesecakes pared with fruit but I've never had a bad one.

I walked in around 4:25pm and sat at the bar.  The bar was unattended but I decided to sit because maybe the bartender was just away for a second.  I sat there for around 5 mins.  At least two restaurant workers walked behind the bar, made their drinks and never acknowledged me.  I sat for another 2-3 mins and no one came out or acknowledged me.  I decided to leave and go to another restaurant.  In the future, there should be someone working at the bar especially during the happy hour time frame that has been marketed to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville

The place is very posh for a Mall restaurant, the menu is GIGANTIC took us almost 20 plus minutes to read through it to decide what we like to eat. The server was nice but seemed annoyed we were taking long time to look over the menu.  Once we did ordered it took over 40 minutes for our meal to come out, it was really good. My daughter enjoyed the catfish, son had teriyaki chicken but thought had bit to much sauce, I had a Pit Beef Sandwich which was good but some the meat was kinda tough to chew but took home to the dog (he enjoyed it) We all got a slice of cheesecake to take home which all enjoyed later that night.

Kasen M.,"Brownsboro Zorn, Louisville, KY",173,105,2995,5.0,7/30/2016,"I took a group of kids for National Cheesecake Day on July 30. On cheesecake day, the Cheesecake Factory always offers half-price pieces of cheesecake. In order to get the half-price discount, you have to dine in. I always look at this as an opportunityto take a group of kids for a real life ""sit down"" restaurant experience.  The Cheesecake Factory is known to be pricey and I work for a non-profit agency. Each year when I take the kids, I make sure to go during a non-peak time. I know the waiters and waitresses work hard for those really big tips off the typical really big bills. Probably lots of folks take advantage of the more affordable cheesecake deal and do what we did. Every year the servers have always been so nice and accommodating. They told us the wait would be 15 to 20 minutes, but we got our table for 7 in about 10 minutes. Long enough for the kids to catch some Pokemon in the lobby.  We had an amazing waitress. She wasn't upset that we only ordered waters to drink. When we sat down I told her we were going to get a few appetizers and then enjoy some of the cheesecake. She seemed happy to serve us. We ordered two pizzas to share. Each pizza had 8 reasonably size slices. She also was quick to refill our drinks and the bread on the table.  She checked on us several times, never making us feel rushed, just being attended to. When the cheesecake came out the kids eyes grew large and their mouths nearly dropped to the table. They'd never seen pieces of cheesecake so big. Having some older kiddos with me, I asked if we could get five coffees. She was quick to bring them along with creamer. The kids, many of them having never been to a ""fancy restaurant"" before were thoroughly impressed with the real creamer. When the check came it was just under $60 for 2 pizzas and 7 slices of cheesecake. As most people do, I slid my credit card into the book and waited for her to take it away. It wasn't until after I had paid and was calculating the tip that I noticed she didn't charge us for coffee.  I'm not sure if she recognized that we were not the typical group of cheesecake factory consumers, but I thought that was really cool of her to not include that on the bill.  I super want to include her name in the review, but don't want to get her in trouble with her boss. So, I'll just say to the Cheesecake Factory: you have some really great people working for you. She was extremely patient, very kind, and truly made this group of kids first sit down fancy restaurant experience something they will remember for years to come. Plus -- the $20 you saved us on coffee can now be spent on other great experiences for my kids -- so thank you and Happy Cheesecake Day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=20

Samantha T.,"Chicago, IL",30,14,18,3.0,1/14/2017,"Have been to this location a handful of times. The food is pretty reliably good, but the cheesecake is the definite draw. The Buffalo blasts and fried Mac n cheese apps are solid, albeit pricey for portions. Good entrees have included: Americana burger, four cheese pasta, chicken carbonara, Cajun chicken littles. The Renee's special was just ok. Good sandwich and soup, but salad is meh. Sandwich portion was tiny for a $13 meal.  The biggest con of TCF for me are the prices. A lot of their entrees and appetizers are really overpriced. Their Cheesecake sizes (depending on flavor) can be vastly different but they all cost $8 per slice.  Most recent visit, got the chicken littles dinner which was $15.50. Got a great portion of chicken, but didn't know until my check that subbing Mac n cheese as a side brought the entree to 18.75! Seriously? Splitting the app, getting this entree and a slice of cheesecake set me back $40 for just my check.

I usually come at 10pm so my experience isn't the dinner rush! We chill at the bar with Sergio or Jill. They take great care of us as we are here once or twice a week after work. It's Cheesecake Factory so expect a huge menu with everything you could ever want. I actually eat off the 'low calorie' menu. Lots of great options including GF and other health conscious choices. They even have a gluten free cheesecake option! I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory.

Kristin S.,"Louisville, KY",131,5,35,5.0,7/31/2017,"I had an amazing dining experience tonight at The Cheesecake Factory. Remarkably it was on the 2nd of 2 days celebrating National Cheesecake Day. Our wait during dinner time was relatively short. Our server, Andrea, was fabulous! She came to the table quickly after we were seated, greeted us, and took our drink orders. Within a few minutes, she brought our drinks and a fresh basket of bread. She asked if we wanted to begin with an appetizer, and when declined, she told us about the nightly specials. She took our orders, after I asked a couple questions and asked for her recommendation between two entrees. She kept our drinks filled during our entire meal, and she interacted with us frequently. I ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad and my friend ordered Spicy Cashew Chicken with extra sauce. (This is the dish that I normally order, but I decided to order off of the SkinnyLicious menu to save room for cheesecake.) Both of our entrees were delicious! My friend only ate half of her meal, and Andrea boxed it up. I ate my entire salad. The tuna was fresh, tender, and spicy, and the shallot dressing made for a great finish. After dinner, I debated on which cheesecake to order. I decided to go with the new Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake, and my friend ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. My cheesecake had Nutella on top. Mmm. The best part--all cheesecakes were half-price! We both asked for our cheesecakes to be boxed to-go, because we were only planning to eat a few bites before taking the rest home. Both of us were very pleased with our choices. Both of us would recommend our entrees and cheesecakes. Andrea's attentiveness, humor, kindness, and work ethic made our dining experience quite pleasant.

I typically can take or leave the Cheesecake Factory so I don't think this review would be any different if I were in my own home town or a different location.  The service was decent. Our server was very nice and checked in is regular. The restaurant was clean and well lit, which I always have a problem with at the Cheesecake Factory because it always seems so dark in there.  I ordered the buffalo wings and the grilled salmon and they were both ok. However the mashed potatoes with my salmon was like warm and had a huge under cooked potatoes in it. The salmon lacked flavor. I had to put salt and pepper on it and the broccoli which was very hard. Obtaining he food was fresh but really not to my liking.

She did not let us know any specials, our food took longer than 20 minutes to get to the table. When we asked if she knew the status of our order, she may as well have rolled her eyes. When she told us to have a good evening, it was mumbled and she said it after she turned to her other table.

Mikel M.,"Louisville, KY",72,1,,2.0,8/3/2017,I visited the Cheesecake Factory this evening with 4 friends- -- working in the service industry myself- I understand how it can be when it's super busy- however- our service tonight I can not say was the best- we had 1 friend already there waiting for us- when we got to the table she had no drink in front of her- said she had not even been offered one - no water- nothing - the server finally approached our table after the other 4 of us got there.  We all had water- I personally ordered a side salad and chicken taquitos- I had to save room for your amazing cheesecake.  The salad I received was less than appealing- leaves- 2 tomato slices- and 2 cucumber slices--- I was hungry so I ate it anyway- but where's the cheese - the croutons- the onion ? The basics for a house salad? And an establishment as yourself I would expect better.  The taquitos I had- after eating what I could- because the chicken on the ends was absolutely BURNT- not just toasted but burnt!!!! I told our server I couldn't eat it- and he obliged and had it taken off our bill.  1 of my friends were offered a box to take her food- when 2 other of my friends needed a box as well but when he didn't even offer and walked away from the table- they decided they were no longer taking it home.  We ordered cheesecake- and when we asked for a box for one of my other friends- he brought out a box that wouldn't even fit hers-- so I had to ask the manager for the proper box so she could take hers and enjoy it at home...  the other girls also decided they wanted a box for theirs as well- when we asked he said he couldn't keep going behind the counter because of how busy it was.  Well as I said I'm in this industry as well- and when it comes to guests needs- the guest should ALWAYS come 1st.... we were ALL pretty disappointed with our service this evening- if ever we decide to return I just hope that the service won't be compromised due to the amount of business at the time ...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=40

Darrell M.,"Louisville, KY",152,10,232,4.0,4/4/2016,"Warning: Not an actual factory.  (I know, I know... too cheesy.  (See what I did there? :-D )) In a nutshell: The broadly eclectic menu means there is something for everyone, no matter how divergent your cuisine craving. Reconciling two different cuisine appetites can be a challenge sometimes and such was the case on Sunday night.  Rejecting his recurring Thai food suggestions and suffering a creative block myself, my dining partner threw out The Cheesecake Factory and it magically seemed to be the perfect choice.  (The gift card I received for my birthday last summer may have been the deciding factor.)   Sunday evening was not a particularly busy time and the 10 minute wait passed by in four.  After being seated in the bar area and taking in the somewhat ostentatious décor anew I noticed something which had escaped me before: the vaguely Egyptian theme most evident in the faces atop the columns. The menu is broadly eclectic and dramatically laid out across more than a dozen laminated, spiral bound pages (complete with ample advertising space!)  On some level, I think the notoriously bulky menu is itself both a literal and figurative marketing device.  Getting through the tome is more manageable if you identify the sections first and then delve into the cuisine which sounds most appetizing.  Unfortunately, there is neither a table of contents nor an index. The service was excellent with the perfect balance of attentiveness and graceful interludes of space.  The food was excellent with a portion size that insured leftovers.  The bar menu included trendy cocktails with cheeky names (The Modern Old Fashioned) alongside a deep wine menu and a surprisingly (refreshingly?) small number of well-chosen beers.  A craving for sweet potato fries prompted me to select the Chicken Parmesan sandwich which I paired with a Bells Two Hearted.  Perhaps not the most elegant of choices, but it was a satisfying combination.  Stuffed after eating just half my sandwich, but not yet so full that I hated myself ... I decided to do the only reasonable thing: order the cheesecake to go.  :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=40

She said they would be seating us soon, so I waited 15 more minutes.  Then we were ready to give up.  I walked up this time ready to just return the pager and before I could finish my sentence the three hostess just kinda said put them at table number whatever.  So they walked us past not one but 5 empty tables and sat us at the last one.  Maybe 5 people got up at once I don't know but I do know those tables were clean and ready to be sat and we were leaving but they just quickly put us in one when we were ready to give up.     Then the server did an ok job up until the end.  My son is 18 months so he makes a mess.  Because of this I always leave at least a 25% tip, regardless of the service because at the end of the day he causes more work for them.  I asked for the check as soon as we got our food because at this point the mall closed in a little over an hour and we still needed to shop.  I never saw the server again, no how was everything, no did you need anything else, nothing.       I would give this place one star because of how poor the service was, but I would be cheating the Cheesecake Factory because the food was very good and I forgot to mention the bar tenders were really good.  But the hostesses and at least my server was below average at best.  I get they were busy but give people realistic time frames and don't get your money and run!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=60
Andy S.,"Memphis, TN",247,554,23,5.0,5/20/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain.  This visit was in Louisville, KY.  I find the restaurants pretty consistent no matter where you are.   Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants.  The cheesecake is really good.  I think their food is really good, too.  The portions are HUGE.  They're often on lists for having the most calories.  It would probably be best to share a meal, but I never have.  I always get my own.  I also always get my own cheesecake.  That's the fat person inside of me trying to get out.   I was lucky enough to have a gift card from my parents.   They had a sign that said ""everyone loves cheesecake.""  The decor is always nice.   I think they have the best brown bread ever.  I don't even like the white bread they serve when I compare it.   I had the house red wine, which was good.  .   My date had the shepherd's pie ,which he seemed to enjoy.     I had the burger with blue cheese and bacon.  I also had a side salad instead of fries but with blue cheese dressing.  Normally, I use minimal dressing, but this one was so good, I tore it up.   The burger was loaded with the bacon and blue cheese.  Super yum.   Garrett had the key lime pie cheesecake.   I had the most ratchetly delicious cheesecake.  Oreo!  The oreos were baked inside.  Super good and super fat.   I wish we had one in Memphis.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=60

Taylor E.,"Evansville, IN",36,2,,2.0,9/24/2016,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory before and have had great service, but I need to rant about what happened there tonight with my boyfriend... we got there and were waiting for our table and decided to look at the cheesecake selection. While standing there, a drunken customer stumbles over and starts leaning directly in front of me looking at the cakes. I moved out of the way and he proceeded to lean in front of me even further, with the back of his head inches from my face. After a few minutes of him continuing to do this, my boyfriend who is standing behind me finally says to him, ""Excuse you..."" and the man looks over at us and literally yells at the top of his lungs, ""GET OUT OF MY FACE!!!!"" My boyfriend said he was just telling him to watch out because he was about to step on me and the man keeps yelling. We ended up walking away and a worker came over to tell us she saw what happened and she was sorry and she let her manager know. The man was seated before us and nothing was said to him. We were seated and we ordered a calamari appetizer. Our entrees came out but we never got our calamari. I let our server know and she apologized but didn't seem to care. I worked at a sit down restaurant in college and if something like that happened to a customer, they would have been well taken care of and definitely not forgotten about like we were tonight,  and we probably would have given them a discount off their bill since the expected appetizer never arrived.

I got my usual, a hamburger on a gluten free bun with lettuce, but I got tomato, onion, pickles, and mayonnaise on it. I'm pretty sure I said none of that stuff. I got it anyway. I picked off the vegetables except the lettuce and mayonnaise. Here's the thing, I don't like mayonnaise. I didn't want to be the one scraping it off of the bun with my cloth napkin, so I ate what I had. Later on, we had to wait forever to get cheesecake to go and our checks.

Tj P.,"Louisville, KY",181,275,604,3.0,5/24/2012,"I have pondered on what to write for this momentous anniversary, my 100th review. And I've gone back and forth in regard to which spot I would choose to review, if I would dig from the 2-year vault or simply go with something more recent. So, I decided to basically straddle the fence and review a place I've been twice, recently and some time ago. However, this review will be mostly based on my latest visit. It's rare that I get a relative in town, even rarer that I have the opportunity to join them for a moment or two when they are here. Thankfully, with my new work schedule, I was available to do both. Meeting my aunt while she was in town for a conference was a nice way to spend a part of my evening, no matter the venue, but the Cheesecake Factory made for a pleasant backdrop. Spacious and beautifully appointed, the Cheesecake Factory is perfect for large casual groups or intimate couples. On this occasion, my aunt and I were joined by several of her co-workers. Most were from much smaller areas of Kentucky and the chance to see a little bit of the ""big city"", and enjoy some ""fine dining"" was likely part of the draw to eat here. Personally, I prefer smaller, local restaurants but the Factory was probably better suited to accommodate the group.  Because the group was moderately large and each of us were on separate bills, it did take some time for dinner to arrive. Dinner portions are huge. You pay for the size though and I wouldn't call it gourmet. Like much of the Cheesecake Factory, the food suffers from a bit of puffery, making things appear more than average. Sadly, average is what it is. The fish tacos I had were dry and bland, the chicken pasta my aunt had was swimming in olive oil. The thing about it is you don't come here for dinner, you truly come for dessert. Unfortunately, you may come away disappointed in that regard too. While the cheesecake is fantastically delicious, this is the one area where the portions are small for what you pay. All in all, while the restaurant experience was somewhat lacking, I came away enjoying the moment and the time spent with my aunt. In my book, that's a win.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=60
Matt B.,"Snohomish, WA",36,396,16,4.0,3/24/2012,"I don't like cheesecake. When the GF found this out about me, she gave me this look like I had just drowned a puppy while giggling like a school girl. But we got past that. We came here because she wanted breakfast, I wanted decidedly NOT breakfast, and we needed to eat near Trader Joe's. It worked. I ordered a burger, medium rare. And it actually came out medium rare. It was amazing. The fries were some of the best fries I've ever had. The GF's breakfast was also cooked to perfection.  Service was amazing. Glasses were never empty, food came quickly, and our waitress was really nice and funny.  I really had no intention of rating it this highly, but the experience was just so good that I had to. I would still prefer to check out a local restaurant, but I did not regret my time here in the slightest. Good place to come when out at the mall.

Moving on to the cheesecake - just to make this review short and sweet - their portion sizes were reduced by 20% since the last time I came here 6 months prior. The apple streusel cheesecake, although delicious, was mostly just apples with a little bit of actual cheesecake. I'll just call it the Toppings Factory from here on out.

I started my review with the dessert since that was the best thing. And why I have 4 stars.  However, the service and the entree left me feeling a bit empty. I ordered the Cuban sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. Hmm, should have stuck with something I was more familiar with. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Cuban food. But, this sandwich. Not good. The pork was dry! I mean inedibly dry. I picked it off and just ate the ham on the sandwich. I will know better next time. Now, the sweet potato fries. Maybe I have a high standard of anything sweet potato seeing as I grew up in the ""Sweet Potato Capital of the World"" but these were rough. They were super dry and super hard. Some had grease seeping from them and crunch while others were to dry to eat. Meh.  The server. Man oh man. You'd think he was afraid of women. There were four of us. Now, we all like to joke with one another and also with others. I don't know if this guy was just stuck up or he is afraid of women. Either way, he was not good at his job at all. We had to stop other servers to ask for ours as he'd seem to disappear for extended periods of times.

Tonight we decided to order appetizers and were not disappointed. Plates are large so be careful about ordering a lot of food if you are not hungry. Chicken lettuce wraps were tasty and served with carrots, cucumbers, noodles, cilantro and bean spouts. They offer three sauces, a thai cilantro sauce, peanut sauce and tangy tempura sauce. All were tasty additions to the boston bibb lettuce that was used to wrap it all up. Potstickers were okay but not great. The soy sauce was a bit salty for my taste. An arugula salad with raisons, nuts and slivers of parmesan in a lemon olive oil dressing was light and delish. You cannot pass up the cheesecake so we had the tuxedo and peanut cup renditions they offer. There are so many choices it takes a while to figure which one to order. My friends from Junior's Restaurant in Brooklyn were shouting at me for eating such a deviation from good old NY cheesecake but when in Rome...

The Louisville Mall looks like Christmas on a Saturday. Cars are backed up on the X-press way exiting onto Shelbyville Rd. Remember, 90% of the people are working, and few thousand Ford employees just got $8K  bonus. All that might explain the 40 minute wait. No chairs of any kind for old seniors to sit and wait. F.  Finally seated, and a waiter is going to impress me with his ability to remember what I ordered without writing it down. That always scares me. True to form, order was wrong. Another F. Didn't bring the salad until they noticed it was missing after the main meal was served. It included the wrong dressing. Had Blue Cheese, which I detest. My wife tasted it and said it was delicious. Couple 18 inches away in a long line of bench backed seating tables offered us some beans that you sucked out of the shell. Hey, this is KY, I had never heard of them,. They were great. Meals finally arrived, our waiter RENEE (The Mentalist) or something I could not understand, was ""On Break"" and a nice fellow was serving us. They brought the bread that was suppose to be as an appetizer with the meal. Overall food was very good. The grilled onions on my burger were great. French Fries way above average for Louisville; but leave salt off next time. My wife enjoyed here food too and the portions were such that we took  a doggie Bag home. Tried the ""famous Cheese cake.

Troy W.,"Louisville, KY",4,323,700,4.0,1/3/2011,"One of my favorite chain restaurants. I love this place.  An individual can spend $15 (probably a drink an entree only) or easily spend $60. I once heard someone complain that this place is expensive. Yes, it can be... if you let it. A 20 spot will almost always take care of business for me. Sometimes I spend a little more. Bring an extra $10 to cover a slice of cheesecake.  Good:  The Mediterranean-style (I think) interior and decor does a great job of taking me to another place (Though I am, I don't feel like I'm at the mall on a busy commercial street.).  I swear I think the menu is thicker than a King James Bible. It's crazy thick with sooooo many ways to please the taste buddies. Like breakfast? Well, I do, and they have a whole page with nothing but omelets served all day. They also have some of the best fish tacos that I've ever had.  Like booths? Well they have 'em. They are big and over-sized. They even have a few round table booths. (Note: regular tables make up most of the seating in this place.)  Bad:  If you do not have the luxury of eating at a booth and are seated at a regular table... be warned... they are practically on top of each other. It is tight. Once at a table, I found it impossible to not watch a guy eating lettuce wraps who was about three feet from my face. I had to make an extra effort to talk to my friends who seemed further away than the lettuce wrap guy.  It gets crowded easy. What do you expect?... it's a popular place. When there is a crowd, it is standing room only (there are only a couple of small benches. The pages they hand out when reach into the mall enough to find a few more benches... but this is still very limited even when the mall is open.  Overall... I love it.

She claims that they have the best burger that she has ever eaten. They have the largest menu that I've ever seen and I order something different every time that I go. My last experience was ""pecan crusted catfish""...recommended by our phenomenal waiter. Usually I'm not a catfish fan because it often has a wild game taste but decided to venture out and I was glad that I did...it was excellent and not like any fish that I've tasted.  My husband once got the medallion steak and was disappointed, he didn't finish it...probably just so that he could have more cheese cake. Speaking of which...Oreo is my favorite. My only complaints are the usually long waits and scarce parking.

My wife was given a $50 gift certificate as a Christmas present then my fellow yelper Troy W. said they had the best fish tacos in the city.  I said I'd never go back but here I come, Cheesecake factory. We put our name in and waited for our plastic disc to buzz while we sat at the bar.  Two pints of Sam Adams Boston Lager were ordered.  Turns out Cheesecake Factory charges $5.50 for Sam Adams.  Jesus, daddy and the spook that's a high mark up!  Disc buzzes, on to the dining round. The dining floor is lit like a crack house.   My wife ordered the chicken thai noodles and I ordered the fish tacos.  I snapped a pick of the fish tacos but it's too dark to tell what it is.  The fish tacos are good.  Not the best I've had but I'd eat them again... if they weren't $14.99.  They can be ordered grilled or tempura style.  I went with tempura.  My only real complaint is the avocado on the tacos was almost non existent.  Other than that the breading was perfect without any greasy mouth feel or taste.   My wife's chicken thai noodles were amazing... and they should be for what they cost.  C'mon, man, this is a chain!  We're not eating at Les Halles!  The portions are huge and the food ranges from good to great.  I just can't get over the prices.  For two beers, two entrees, and two pieces of cheese cake, we spent over $70.  If prices were more reasonable I would have no problems returning.  I just don't feel like the cost to quality line up... especially for a chain... a chain at a mall. Oh - the cheesecake that this factory cranks out... just ok.  The key lime cheesecake I got from a Publix grocery in Florida was just as good for half the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=100

Eve V.,"Prospect, KY",0,28,,4.0,8/1/2011,"Loooooool cheesecake factory.  Ok kids, first off, you must stop laughing to discuss the cheesecake factory. It's hard to do :( the cheesecake factory is the Godzilla  that ate PF Changs, the best parts ( gag) of The Olive Garden, and a J. Alexanders. The Cheesecake Factory stomped all over these places and regurgitated them out in a spewing barrage of fire next to a Victoria's Secret. Plus, cheesecake.  Before moving to Louisville, I had never been to one of these places. After the moving truck had left and I was sobbing amidst 89546 boxes my husband looked at me and said HEY, YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A CHEESECAKE FACTORY LET'S GO TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. This from a man who is a regular at Viajante on Picadilly Square.  Ummm, parking is never an issue at TCF. It's got mall parking, plus,valet. The restaurant, Awww shit, we can't even call it a restaurant... It's like a COMPOUND. the compound seats roughly the size of a small country. If the people of Monaco ever decided to go out to eat together they could probably fit in TCF. It's a clean place, with a sort of vaguely Mediterranean feel, and has lots of glass art sort of junk all over. They have GIANT booths that seat like twenty people.  The menu weighs roughly the size of a teenager. BUT THEY SERVE BOOZE, and they have about 100 different wines. The cocktails are pretty boozy too, and big, Both the Mojito and Lemon Drop I've had were actually quite good. And onto the food... I hate recommending TCF. There are hundreds of independently owned restaurants where you can get a better meal for cheaper. everything at TCF is the WORST part of Amerikkkkka, gigantic portions, sugar in EVERYTHING,  TCF is why you're fat, but..but...but.. The food is pretty good. It's not exactly innovative or exciting but it's good. After eating there I actually read a few articles about TCF to like, make myself feel better about not hating it. It turns out TCF is hugely popular with pro athletes due to the portion sizes. NPR had a segment about trying to disparage the food served there and despite terrifying calorie counts they just couldn't. It's consistently voted one if the best "" chain restaurants"" and it's pretty easy to see why. Stand outs for me include The Vietnamese tacos with Asian pork and lots of fresh cilantro, The spicy cashew chicken, and the Chicken and biscuits, which is perfect, trashy, buttery food coma goodness. They also carry something called a "" glamburger"" which I have never tried, but I like to imagine it's a hamburger covered in glitter and rhinestones. the worst part of the meals are the actual cheesecakes, they are just gooey globs of very mild cheesecake usually covered in syrups or stuffed with drugstore candy.  You sort of have to at least try TCF. It's like Disneyworld. You go, you see what all the fuss is about, you never have to go again. But if you do go, get a glamburger and tell me if it comes on a rotating, mirrored platform.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-louisville?start=120
John H.,"Louisville, KY",40,13,,1.0,7/21/2012,"I had lunch there today, thanks to a gift card I received for Xmas. There was a ten minute wait for a table for some reason, even though I could see 10-15 empty tables in a section where they just weren't seating anybody. There wasn't anywhere to sit during this wait, because there were so many other people waiting, so we stood the entire time.  When our food finally arrived 30 minutes after we were seated, our orders were wrong. The food runner set everything down as fast as he could and ran away before we could tell him. He delivered two identical sandwiches, but called one a club and one a blackened chicken. I guess he could only tell the difference because of the side items, which were both NOT the sides we ordered. Five minutes later, our server came to check on us and started to correct our order, That whole process took another ten minutes. The blackened chicken came in two minutes while the sweet potato fries came five minutes after that. So, either the chicken was sitting under a heat lamp the entire time, or it was sitting on another table where someone else touched it and took it apart to realize they had the wrong sandwich. I know they didn't remake it because it came too quick. I know mistakes happen, but if the food runner had spent more than five seconds delivering our food, it could have worked out better.  By the time this was all worked out, we were both so frustrated that we barely ate the bland $12 chicken sandwiches and were ready to leave. The only thing that was faster than the food runner was our server when we asked for our check. She was ready to get us out of there, apparently. I spent 50 minutes of life dealing with this place.

However, this cheesecake factory is the least consistent of them all... and their ingredients are below average. I always get the calamari for appetizer, whether I eat in or take it togo. I have noticed that the portions of the calamari here is WAYYY smaller than all the other cheesecake factories. In addition, the last two times I got the calamari togo, it had a bad fishy/seafood taste. I love seafood, so I can take strong seafood taste. The calamari just tasted like they were in the freezer forever. Disgusting. The shepards pie I got last time was so gross. It had a strong meat taste. I dunno how old the ground beef was. NOT RECOMMENDED. I'm too scared to ever get the shepard's pie here again. I always get the louisiana chicken pasta, it's usually pretty good here. That's probably the only thing that's consistent so I will keep getting the louisiana chicken pasta from here. I've gotten the chinese chicken salad from here, it came without chicken. WHAT THE HECK??? Overall, this cheesecake factory is not as good as the other ones. This is the only one in Kentucky so I'm stuck with going to this one.
