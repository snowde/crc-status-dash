Cleda W.,"Madison, WI",550,137,109,4.0,11/25/2017,"Chain that mostly in larger cities. We are lucky to have one in Madison. For this particular location, it's mostly a hit with a few misses. Each time, the food is fantastic. The service is okay. Depends on the day and the server. Food: So many options. Too many options. Great for picky eaters because they will find something. I recommend the chicken samosas and fried zucchini for apps. These are my go-to apps. The calamari was too greasy and over breaded (so much that the breading was not cooked all the way for some of the pieces). I love their pastas. The burgers are massive. Fries are always hot. Portions are large. I always have enough to have two extra meals the next day. Some of my favorites include the Cajun Chicken Littles. Tip: sub out the corn succotash for their Mac & Cheese. Do it. The bread to share for the table is free. Some times it's warm and some times it's not.  Ambiance: it's low lit. There are a lot of tables. Bar looks nice High tops -- look uncomfortable. I recommend a booth because their chairs are not that comfortable. All weekends are crowded. There will always be a wait. Go a bit early so you can grab a pager and get on the list. Service: Ok. This is where it's a miss sometimes. I understand that it gets busy. The last server I had was great in the beginning, but then it went a bit downhill. I asked for a glass of ice and it never came. Refills on drinks were not automatic. We had to ask each time for different people. Plates were never cleared unless they were boxed. This day, it was not busy so I am not sure what happened. Overall --- good place for a group of people, a first date or a place to bring the kids. Lots of friendly smiles. Oh, of course-- the cheesecake is great. Linda's Fudge Cake. Try it. I am not a sweets person, but this cake might convert me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Amy G.,"Oregon, WI",30,46,69,3.0,10/15/2017,"We decided on The Cheesecake Factory for our latest date night.  When we arrived it was obviously busy and was told it would be a 30 minute wait, which was fine as we wanted to do a little shopping anyways.  The wait was closer to 45 minutes so by the time we got seated, we were starving.  We waited another 10 minutes or so for our server to take our order.  We ordered our drinks (JW's Pink Lemonade for me, and a Modern Old Fashioned for my husband) as well as an appetizer (Chicken Taquitos). The Taquitos were good, almost an exact twin to the Firecracker Chicken Wraps at Longhorn.  My drink was super delicious, but if I had known it was going to be $10.50 (their prices aren't on their menu for cocktails), I probably would have ordered something else.  We ordered our meals (Chicken and Biscuits for me, and Thai Coconut Lime Chicken for my husband) and they arrived promptly.  One of my biscuits was very overdone, borderline burnt, but otherwise my meal was good, and my husband enjoyed his as well. We were in and out in about 45 minutes, which is pretty good for a very busy Friday night.  The bill was a shocker though; I had no idea the drinks were that expensive (about $43 of the bill was just drinks), nor was I wanting to spend nearly $100 on dinner that night.  If the service was amazing and the food was spot on, then I could see it warranting that price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Janice J.,"Madison, WI",11,72,18,4.0,8/28/2017,"I wouldn't have chose to eat here as we prefer to stay away from corporate but this is where Grandma wanted to go - and who can deny Grandma? =)  We got here around 4:30p on a Friday and the place was empty.  Our server quickly greeted us and took our drink order.  I was so overwhelmed with the menu, and I noticed there were duplicates between the regular menu and the specialty menus which didn't help.  I'm a big fan of small menus that you do really well versus the large menu that you do mediocre.  All four of us ordered something different, tho, and it was all amazing.  The bread that came before the menu was tasty too - with a few different options. I got the bang bang chicken and shrimp with brown rice and my fiance got the jambalaya.  He somehow managed to finish most of his while I ended up taking 3/4 of mine home.  It was just as good leftover and it fed both of us lunch the next day.  All four of us also took a piece of cheesecake home.  I hope that no one eats the entire piece in one sitting....it took me 4 different times to finish it (which is JUST fine).   I always hear how big their portion sizes are and how terrible (for you) the food is.  I don't feel like this is a place to come if you're watching what you eat, plain and simple.  If you're on a diet, just stay away.  This place is a treat, not a regular eating spot.  Their ""skinnylicious"" menu is a joke - don't let the clever words fool you.  Pot pie should never be on a ""skinny"" menu! Our server was decent - nothing fantastic - but he did his job.  The place was immaculately clean, well decorated and a bit on the noisy side.  We will likely take a piece of cheesecake to go but doubt we'll ever return for a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Suzanne X.,"Madison, WI",323,105,508,4.0,7/30/2017,"Maybe 3.5 to be nice, rounding up since I already rated it 3 for our previous experience. However, given our waitress was accommodating and nice, we'll be a little more generous in our rating.  We came back, this time it was to celebrate a friend's last day in Madison (goodbye, farewell, definitely come back to visit!) and another friend's belated birthday, so we had a large crowd of 15.  Friends arrived around 7:30PM and waited patiently till 8:15 before we were finally seated (it was the double seat tables in the back by the kitchen grouped together into two larger separate tables - we went ahead and just combined the separation, the reasoning was since it was a curved seating, it didn't fully align but having it separate seemed more awkward).  Given our large party, the waitress took down our drink orders and then came back shortly after for our food order. In a little while, all the food arrived in what seemed like a shorter period of time than when we were waiting for food the other day.  The food itself was just okay. Again still overpriced for the quality of food we received, but nonetheless, edible and delicious especially if you're starving. We didn't finish our meals till 9:30PM, given how long it took to seat us and then a few friends orders cheesecakes and other desserts. For our belated friend's birthday, they even provided a free fudge dessert (she ended up not eating it since she already ordered tiramisu cake but another friend happily gobbled it up).  When it came to the bill, the two friends meals that we were out to celebrate were split onto the remaining bills. However, one item was only split onto two bills, waitress was nice enough to have this as a separate bill and allowed us to chip in to pay for it separately. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Tina L.,"Madison, WI",121,54,111,3.0,7/7/2017,"It is undeniable that this is a popular and trendy chain of restaurant. The design is the same every where. Customer service has been great for me so far. The food: Warning! Huge portion!! I always have to take half if not even more ham half packed to go and have food coma later. I would say you will definitely get the money worth with the portion even though it is a little bit more pricey. They offer a wide variety of cuisine and food but everything is average. If only they focused on one cuisine and made it really good.  The cheesecake: Very big as well! And they have the most variety I have ever seen. 90% of the cheesecake that I tried here have been very good. It is, though, very chocolaty, creamy, fatty, cheesy, etc. In short, you get a tons of rich flavor in one bite.  Side note but I really love the brown bread they have before the entree. And good news is it is free so of course I always order more of that :P",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Lauren H.,"Madison, WI",98,193,184,4.0,7/28/2017,"I had not eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in a good 10 years, and I've spent those years thinking the Cheesecake Factory is just a typical chain with mediocre food and a large variety of cheesecake. I was pleasantly surprised with my recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory. Pros/cons of my experience at this Cheesecake Factory: Pros: -Our server named Caleb was friendly, professional and attentive. -My salmon dish was wonderful. The salmon tasted fresh, and the dill cream sauce was excellent. The sauce ratio was perfect since it lasted the whole meal as I was able to eat every bite of my salmon, broccoli and potatoes with the sauce and still had a little extra when I was finished eating. (Well, I'm someone who could simply drink dill cream sauce ...) -The cheesecake (we tried tiramisu and chocolate chip cookie dough) was heavenly. Cons: -The mushrooms with my salmon dish weren't cooked very much, and they were sort of bland. They seemed raw in texture. -While the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake was great, the actual cookie dough chunks in the cake had an off flavor like processed cookie dough. I know the flavor of from-scratch cookie dough, and this was not it. -Why are the calories for each slice of cheesecake typed on the menu?! I'll definitely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
David H.,"Sun Prairie, WI",19,481,270,3.0,10/15/2017,Mixed feelings about the chain. Fancy seating and lighting. I've been here a few times and its been hit and miss. The menu is massive! If you cant find something you want here you should just give up. If I could rate it a 3 1/2 I would. I had the Steak Diane last time and it was just ok. I can make it better at home. The cheesecake each time has been amazing! Each time it was a wait which isn't the most fun thing. Plenty of seating just not enough staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Stephanie W.,"Madison, WI",28,182,41,4.0,5/22/2017,"I absolutely love the cheesecake factory and I love their location. All of their food and especially the bakery are amazing. I wish I could give their store 5 stars but unfortunately I have had not such good experience with calling in for take out food. I've tried it twice, one time I gave up after 20min being on hold and literally being transferred from one staff to another. The other time, finally after 15min I was able to place my other and pick it up. They need to improve their way of calling in their orders. Putting an order in in the store itself, and picking up is not a problem, but something is not working on the telephone end. I like the ability of rapid pick up on the curb side of the restaurant. This place has a great location, and the ability to seat people inside, in the mall and outside. Their decor reminds me a Las Vegas casino - anything can happen. Don't forgot to leave room for dessert as their portions are quite large.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Thomas T.,"Cross Plains, WI",24,278,16,3.0,1/31/2017,"Where to start?  Walking in, it had the feel of a Vegas casino.  I know that sounds strange, but hear me out.  It's large, open, and feels fancy with browns and golds throughout the dining area.  But what really got me was the smell.  It had the aura of a piped-in perfume, much like some Las Vegas casinos and their reception areas.  I'm not complaining - it was nice, but not what I expected. We sat down as a group of 8.  Plenty of room - it wasn't busy at all (11:45am on a Monday).  As we all know by now, the menu is extensive.  Knowing this ahead of time, I was browsing online to narrow down my choices so I was ready at game time.  I went with the pit beef dip sandwich that came with fries.  I had heard about the gigantic portions, so I figured for the $14.50 I would eat half of it for lunch and save the other half for dinner.  When it arrived, I was a little disappointed to see it was ""normal sized"".  It was delicious - no doubt.  I'd eat this again (and again and again).  The portion of fries was also reasonable.  Frankly, it was a great portion for lunch, but the price was steep for what I got. Everyone else seemed pretty happy with their food - ranging from jambalaya to white chili to a chicken parm sandwich.  As we all got our food and started to eat, we noticed one in our party had no food.  After a minute, a manager (SUPER nice and very attentive) came by to apologize for the meal not being ready - it was done, but not done properly, so they were making it again.  Great - I love that they have standards!  The manager also was quick to say there would be no charge for that meal.  When it came out, we all thought it looked great. I'm not a big cheesecake fan.  I love cheese.  I really love cake.  But let's keep them separate, please.  So I miss out on that draw with this place. All in all, I'd eat here again, but I'd rather do it with a BOGO coupon or something that dials in my perceived value.  Or if work was buying or something.  If I was out with people and they said ""hey, let's grab lunch somewhere"", I would suggest something else (financial decision).  The food is really good, but lots of places offer that. If the prices are more reasonable, I bump this to 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Emily D.,"Madison, WI",78,137,19,3.0,10/4/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory, aka 'Ole Trusty. You don't come here for their culinary prowess or ambiance. You come here for the giant portion sizes,1000+ calorie slices of cheesecake and wear stretchy pants and flip flops without judgement. The menu is outrageously huge, so even your adult sister with the palate of a 5 year old will find something that they will not complain (too much) about. So glad to have this, not really a factory, factory, in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Carolyn S.,"Madison, WI",16,60,145,3.0,12/29/2016,"I've been here twice within the past year. Once for dinner and once for lunch. First off, let me say, that the decor is very nice and ""fancy"" for being a restaurant located inside the mall. With that being said, it is a nicely dim lit atmosphere compared to the lively brightly lit shopping you may have done previously, perfect for sitting down to a relaxing meal. The ambiance earned 2 stars from me.  As for the food, I'm ambivalent. The menu is quite extensive, and as good as that may seem, I think if it were shorter, they could focus and perfect the offerings. They offer complimentary bread loaves (a sourdough and a sweeter dark loaf) with pads of butter. Hope you've got strong teeth. The sourdough especially was more than crusty. I think I tore the roof of my mouth on that sucker.  My first meal there was in the evening. I had the Steak Diane. Medallions of tender steak in a mushroom wine sauce, served alongside mashed potatoes. While I did enjoy it for the most part, I was also aware of how calorie dense it tasted.   The 2nd meal I had was at lunch time. I ordered the beet arugula salad with goat cheese. It tasted pretty good. I've had better at other restaurants though. The spines of the arugula were a bit on the tough side. However, I am grateful that a restaurant IN the mall offers fresh greens and vegetables as an option, if you don't want to eat heavy. (you can find it on the ""skinnylicious menu"" or in the ""small plates & snacks"" section of the menu.). We also split an order of the flatbread with sausage, ricotta and kale. I loved it. Probably my favorite thing I've had in this restaurant, and I don't even like sausage!  Okay, now for the main event, the cheesecake! Ummm, for a $7 slice of cheesecake, I'm expecting to be impressed. Wow. (That's an unenthusiastic ""wow"" by the way). Both times I was too full, and took my cheesecake home for later. It's fluffy cheesecake, not the dense, 'resistance against your fork when you cut in for a bite' type of cheesecake that makes you aware that there's actually, ya know....cream cheese in there. If you love the whipped type cheesecake desserts, then you'll probably love it. Plus, there are so many flavor choices to choose from.  So, to sum this up, I would visit again, if I've been shopping this mall and am weary and hungry. I would visit this restaurant if family or friends want to meet up there, but I would not single this place out as a restaurant to visit because I keep thinking about the food.  Prices are elevated for the quality of food you'll be receiving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Erin B.,"Madison, WI",12,92,83,4.0,7/18/2017,"I'm definitely torn between 3 and 4 stars. But since it was better than I thought it was going to be, I'll round up. It was my first visit since usually over the top chain restaurants aren't my thing. But, lo and behold, I found myself there with a friend the other night. I felt like I walked through a narnia door of West Towne Mall into a Vegas casino restaurant. It's a huge place, and was pretty busy on a Friday night. But we got a table right away. The menu was extremely aggravating. It was too large - too many pages and too many sections. And fine, yes it's good to list calories so everyone knows how much they're going to eat, the calories in everything there was appalling. I mean, it didn't stop me, but still appalling. The only way to get a meal under 1000 kcal is to order from the Skinnylicious menu. Yes, that's what's it's called. Is this place especially built for pre-bachelorette party dinners? Grrr. One last complaint, our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, but way too overbearing. She must have stopped by our table 20 times just to check on us. If you're wondering if I gave them four stars by mistake, hang in there. We had cocktails that were amazing and our food was fantastic. I loved my Asian pear martini and the miso salmon was delicious. The Korean cauliflower was ok,but it had too much breading. Wine/beer list was ok. And yes, the cheesecake was good. Not best thing I've ever eaten good, but yummy. Service was overall very good. Everything was served in such large quantities that we had a lot of leftovers. I won't rush back, but I'll be much less dubious when friends tell me how much they like the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Alexandra S.,"Appleton, WI",9,61,86,5.0,2/20/2017,While my friend and I were in Madison doing some shopping we had a craving for cheesecake. What better place to go other then the Cheesecake Factory.

Betty N.,"Hanover Park, IL",0,4,3,2.0,8/13/2017,"Definitely a case of the restaurant franchise and quality problem.  Our waitress seemed overworked, tired and unfriendly.  Not only did my silverware come with dried food on it, so did my boyfriend's. I've attached pictures of the dirtiest ones- be sure to check them before using them. Food was bland, overpriced- you are paying for the ambience and interior decoration than for the food, some of the ahi tuna slices were shredded and simply layered underneath other ones to hide it, was not fresh, very corporate-franchise. I doubt they have a real chef in the kitchen.  They could've at least made the plating attractive. Not the worst restaurant experience, but I'll not bother to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Kristine N.,"Madison, WI",2,16,36,4.0,11/23/2016,"My sister and I come all the time for Sunday brunch and I am a fan. One thing I enjoy about Cheesecake Factory is their complimentary bread basket, including a sweet, wheat bread and a crispy sourdough. The warm bread is a great started before our meal.  Our usual order is the Bruleed French Toast ( $10.50) and the Spinach and Mushroom Omelette ($11.95). The French Toast is huge and so good! The outside is crisp, whereas, the inside is light and fluffy. It comes with one strawberry on top (why not more strawberries?!?!?), with great syrup.  The omelette is fluffy, stuffed with excellent sautéed mushroom and spinach. The omelet also comes with toast and country-style fries. The omelet is served all day, whereas the french toast is only served on the brunch menu (from 10:00am- 2:00pm).  I also love their cheesecake. I have tried the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake, Fresh Strawberry, and Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake ($7.95/slice). You can't go wrong with any flavor!  Cheesecake Factory is usually a go-to for dinner, but I prefer their Sunday Brunch menu. Definitely try the brunch here and don't forget to grab a slice of cheesecake on your way out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison
Elisa D.,"Houston, TX",1,27,5,4.0,7/30/2017,"We came here for the National Cheesecake Day celebration expecting madness, and madness it was.  After a 30 minute wait for a table, we finally were seated and greeted by Jackie, who turned out to be a fabulous server even though she was extremely busy the entire time we were there. Cheesecake was half-price, so my mother and I ordered a slice of the vanilla bean cheesecake and a slice of the cheesecake they were debuting, the celebration cheesecake. Dad, for some reason still unknown to us, ordered a salad.  While we waited for our cheesecake, dad munched away on his cobb salad which he very much enjoyed and would absolutely order again. The kitchen was moving a lot faster than the cheesecake area which is understandable, but coordination could have been better so that my dad wasn't finished with his food by the time ours arrived 20 minutes after his.  The vanilla bean cheesecake okay. I've had some really excellent vanilla bean desserts, but this was just so overpowering that the vanilla bean flavor had me tapping out before the sheer richness of the cheesecake. What was worth the hour long wait was the celebration cheesecake. 1.5 to 2 times the size of their normal cheesecake slices, and just as good. The cake portion was perfectly cooked and not soggy at all, the strawberry layer popped without overpowering the rest of the dessert, and the sprinkles and funfetti were just downright fun. Hopefully they keep this one around!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison

Vilay W.,"Windsor, WI",55,195,339,3.0,3/28/2017,"This place was super busy! Kind of wish it wasn't part of the mall. It has potential to be a nice romantic spot or a more quiet intimate spot for a dinner. The tables are so small, the place seems cramped. There were so many people breaking dishes and dropping things on accident because of the tables, or lack there of, I mean... the tables are pretty small... Sheesh! But this place has potential!!!

Stacey L.,"Madison, WI",1587,968,1680,3.0,1/14/2016,"Ah, so torn. I'm probably closer to a 3.5, but the insane calorie count convinced me to round down instead of up. While I enjoyed my meal, I don't know if I could again knowing how awful it was for me.  While running errands on the westside my gent decided he wanted to try The Cheesecake Factory because he hadn't eaten and wanted, in his words, ""something heavy that will sit in [his] stomach for awhile."" We made our way to the packed mall and were told it'd be a 50 minute wait. That's about what we expected so we took our pager and wandered the mall for a bit.  Somehow we managed to avoid many of the service issues that many reviewers seem to be encountering, but our server is also one of the better ones I've had in awhile at any establishment - shouts to Brianna J. if anyone from CF reads this. Our food all arrived in a reasonable amount of time, we (mostly) got what we ordered, and we were out in about an hour.  For a starter we had the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Meatballs. Not something I probably would have ordered myself, but I gave them a try and they were delicious. The bleu cheese dipping sauce was a bit ridiculous - the chunks of bleu cheese were so large that three of them took up the whole serving cup. I guess that's maybe better than undetectable amounts of cheese?  Shortly before the meatballs arrived we were also given a bread basket - the bread was soft and warm and sadly taken away when a bus boy cleared our other plates. Our server brought us another basket, though, which we stuffed in our to-go boxes later.  For entrees the BF got Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and I had the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club. I was bummed to find out that they don't offer the Navajo Chicken Sandwich but this was fairly close in ingredients minus the bread choice. I ordered it with cheddar instead of Swiss, and when it arrived our server asked me if it had the correct cheese. I poked around and couldn't see where it was in the monster sandwich and then we determined there was no cheese at all. Brianna was kind and apologetic and offered to take it back to the kitchen and I said that it wasn't a big deal - it's more that I don't like Swiss than that I wanted the cheddar.  The sandwich itself was really, really good. Flavorful, perfectly toasted, fresh veggies, crispy bacon. It's a towering beast - it was about four inches in height and required a good deal of smushing to get a solid bite. No complaints, though - I made three meals of the sandwich with the fries that accompanied it and the bread.  The unfortunate thing is that the sandwich comes in at 1400 calories. I don't know what they do to it - grilled chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado on bread shouldn't be that bad for you. There's a similar sandwich at Panera where the only major difference is that it's turkey instead of chicken that is 500 calories. Even if they used two full tablespoons of butter to grill the bread it wouldn't nearly triple the calorie count. If the fries were included that'd make slightly more sense, but they're listed separately on the nutrition chart so I kind of think not. Woof. Both of us were stuffed so we opted out of ordering dessert (also...$8 for cheesecake that I imagine is mass-produced somewhere is a bit steep), but the selections in the case looked good.  The food and service on our visit was good. The price and calorie count, not so much. We'll most likely be back at some point, but if we'd have had poor service I probably wouldn't feel the need to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison

That shows me management is not over looking small details. In a place like this no excuses.  Strike 1!  2 of the last 3 visits we waited a very long time to recieve our food, only to get wrong items or not impressive food.  The one time they felt so bad, because they were out of the appitizer we orderd after waiting for it and then ot never coming. Then I got the wrong meal they ended up buying our entire dinner.  I did not complain or ask for that, but they felt so bad for ruining our dinner.  Strike 2!  So now today we actually had good service, a very interesting Thia Wrap appitizer with 3 great sauces.  Good start!  However our sandwich and salad were horrible.  We orderd the Cuban sandwich and a salad.  The Cuban sandwich was very dry and over cooked.  The bread was way over toasted almost to a point were it was crunchy. It needed a little mustard or a sauce to help out the dry overcooked meat. Then the salad was so bitter tasting I personally could not eat it.  I believe this place has a reputation of being fine dining paired with a large selection of fancy cheesecakes.  I just cant bring myself to like this place. I will not go to a place just for dessert. They are a very nice, classy joint, but always are a letdown on the food.  For the price I feel I should never feel like the food was no good.  We decided today that it will be our last visit.  Consistantly bad in our visits.

JS L.,"Madison, WI",0,1,,1.0,1/15/2016,"This location is terrible: from service and appearance to menu and food, there is honestly nothing that garners a ""star"" on this review. Unfortunately Yelp doesn't give me that option.  Sounds harsh, I know. So let me break this down and hopefully someone would care enough to read the reviews and strive for improvement.  Let's start with the host station; you know, the first impression of any business. Well, in this case we get a snotty girl who just doesn't give a f*ck. As if we have inconvenienced her to ask for a seat. Also she has this habit of setting off the wait list buzzer before anyone is ready to take us to our table. How perplexing...  When we've finally managed to reach a table, we were extremely concerned by the bits of left over food stuck on all the silverwares. I assumed all the tables were set by actual human beings so I was a bit insulted by the level of dirtiness on my table. I mean, would THEY eat off of those greasy plates and forks??  On to the menu now: the menu is a novel. You can basically find every dish imaginable, from japanese to thai to mexican to irish to italian to american and beyond! And what's up with all the ads on ever page?? Note: allow for extra time when dining at CCF because the servers won't come back to take your order for at least 30 min. after you're seated, and trust me you'll need that much time to look through the plethora of choices offered.  As for the food, lol.... First of all don't bother ordering anything for your kids on the kids menu; they're all watered down with milk. The soupiness and blandness of my daughter's mac n cheese made any kraft instant boxes look gourmet. Then came the gigantic entrees that would feed an entire third-world country village. Big portions are nice, but what's the sense in stuffing my face with raw pasta, salt, and grease? Paired with previous left over food bits stuck on my forks? No thank you. Mind you, prices per entree averages at $19. So there. I will take my $100 and put it in any local restaurant that takes pride in their menu and cares about my patronage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=60

You get enough food to make a whole second meal in leftovers! If you give one star because you had to wait, then go across the street to Denny's where you'll be happier and probably better suited for you anyways. All the food is really good. The prices are more than reasonable for the quantity and quality, and the cheesecake is awesome. Just a fun place. Obviously they are working with a new staff.

It was wonderful. The waiter suggested the ahi tuna carpaccio rather than the crab cakes for the starter. It was fresh and came drizzled with Aioli and fresh avocado. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and it was delicious and was a HUGE portion.

Its hard to argue that you can exit the Cheesecake Factory without a full belly and a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, that comes at the cost of some of the most high calorie entrees imaginable. The place does a decent job of managing the huge demand put on it by the throngs of mall-goers hungry for some Wisconsin-sized plates. And to be fair, they do have a full ""skinnylicious"" menu to encourage, or at least offer, more healthy menu options.

Jacob M.,"Madison, WI",7,56,32,5.0,1/23/2016,"I really enjoy this place. My wife has taken me a few times when she lived in CA and we've driven to the one in Milwaukee. She was excited when this location opened and I think she should be. We went here on a Friday night for dinner with two other couples. It was not surprisingly jam packed. We came at 6pm and we were told it was a 2-hour wait, but we were seated in one hour. Pretty impressive. The atmosphere is pretty loud, which is perfectly fine for our group since we love a good laugh and have tons of energy.  Our server was Joe. He was above average and answered any questions and concerns we had, especially with our orders. Big points. He gave us enough attention and refilled water without 'being in the way.' Our food was delicious. My wife ordered their special, which was salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli in a lemon cream sauce with mushrooms. I ordered their BBQ burger which I've previously enjoyed in the past. I asked for it to be cooked medium and it was more medium-rare, but better than well-done like other establishments. No complaints, really. Everyone else enjoyed their meals: jambalaya, miso salmon, some other burger, and another chicken dish.  The cheesecakes were the cherry on top. My wife and I shared a Snickers cheesecake. Our slice seemed smaller than everyone else's, but Joe explained it well enough that certain cheesecakes are made differently, etc. For instance, the Dream Extreme (oreo cheesecake) is pretty massive, but a big part of it is the chocolate cake piece. I had a taste of the Tiramisu cheesecake: my wife loved it, I could care less for it. It was too strong in my opinion. Our friend loved her vanilla bean cheesecake.

Henry Z.,"Madison, WI",336,89,8,4.0,11/27/2015,"Going to the Cheesecake factory was a walk down memory lane. I remember back in high school when I was so excited to go here. I thought I was so fancy bringing girls here after a movie, where the ceilings were so tall, the walls decorated with classy moulding, and stone flooring where the click of heels can be heard as crisp as a bell. High school me thought that this was the Waldorf. Now that I've lived a bit, I know how silly it seems to be so impressed with the Cheesecake Factory, but coming ""back"" here after so many years gave a helpful heap of nostalgia in a time of the year of thinking back. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant with the same corporate structure (I think) of others like the Olive Garden or Applebee's. The food has stayed impressively uniform across time and space, and even the architecture and decor are carefully curated to produce the same ambiance across all of their restaurants. The food is a cross-section of presentable but comfortably familiar American foods, such as shrimp scampi or steak Diane, as well as delightful Asian fusion items like Thai spring rolls that are scattered within the menu to liven up the palate of their extensive menu. And, as the name of the restaurant might suggest, there is cheesecake and plenty of it. First, my order: a crab and artichoke dip for appetizer; chicken marsala (chicken in a mushroom and Marsala wine sauce) and pasta (I asked for angel hair instead of the default farfalle*); and a Godiva three-chocolate cheesecake. A lot of food, that's for sure. The food is not bad. Sure, it's nothing to be blown away by, since it's a chain restaurant and not run by a celebrity chef. The crab in the dip was probably canned or frozen and lacked the oceanic umami typical of fresh crab. The chicken was pretty tender, the pasta not overcooked, and the mushrooms well-seasoned and the main source of savory in this dish. A small part of me suspects that the sauce was premade because it feels thickened artificially, but it could just be the quirk of the chef to prefer their Marsala sauce with a slicker and thicker consistency than what I'm used to.  I guess in hindsight this shouldn't really be a surprise, but the cheesecake ended up being the highlight of the evening. It is composed of three forms of chocolate cake layered on top of each other. On the bottom is a flowerless chocolate cake. In the middle is a traditional cheesecake of chocolate flavor and composition. The top layer is chocolate mousse. All of the chocolate are from Godiva, and you also get a hearty slice with two large clouds of whipped cream (I'm pretty sure canned though) on the side. I was particularly happy with the cheesecake because 1) I haven't had chocolate in a very long time, and this reminded me of how delicious chocolate is; and 2) it's not too sweet, which I was afraid of going in. There were tons and tons of other options, so I can really only vouch for one very specific choice among the cornucopia of cheesecake options available. For me, if this meal were served to me without any hint of what restaurant it was from, I'd be less impressed with the food itself. But for me, and I hope for many others, the Cheesecake Factory is delightfully innocent. In other chain restaurants, there are always promotions and deals that make you aware of how commercial the entire endeavor is, and then when enough food for four people are put in front of one person, your eyes glaze over and you're focused less on tasting and more on eating. I don't want to feel like a deal hunter on Black Friday, out hunting for the highest calorie count with the lowest dollars. The Cheesecake Factory, with their menu of familiar food items culminating in a winning dessert, brings in the mind of this reviewer the comfort of familiarity and pleasure of being disarmingly charming. And it's not expensive! This three-course meal came out to $40. The Cheesecake Factory is meant to be accessible to everybody, and without feeling exploitative. Here I am just reminded of decent food and a fun and cheerful experience. *I strongly dislike farfalle because it's never cooked evenly given its uneven thickness. The edges are mushy while the ""knot"" stays doughy and uncooked. I feel that too few people notice this, so consider this a PSA against farfalle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=60

Tom B.,"Verona, WI",3,37,2,3.0,1/20/2016,"I've been to more than one Cheesecake Factory over the years.  I've always thought of this chain as being heavy on hype, but short on delivering the goods. It has been a few years since my last encounter though, and naturally I was interested when they opened up at West Towne.  So I paid a visit today with the family, quietly hoping for a more memorable experience than I had in the past. The restaurant presents itself well.  I like the curvy aisles and the booth-heavy seating.  Let's face it, everyone wants a booth, and nobody wants to feel like they are being placed on a grid.  The use of low light and warm color tones makes for a comfy environment.  Unfortunately the place is a madhouse right now, but I can see it rounding into form after the opening rush quiets down. Once I started leafing through the menu, my memory of past visits started to return.  The thing is huge.  Pages of small plates, appetizers, pizzas, sandwiches, every kind of specialty you can imagine.  Asian inspired dishes.  South Western inspired.  Italian inspired.  Just a flood of choices.  Where's the cheesecake?  Oh, it's there.  Lost somewhere among all the other stuff. It's meant to be impressive, this overwhelming barrage of choices.  And, sure, it is.  But it's also hard to pick one thing from a list of...everything.  I felt like I might get lost and forget what looked good 3 pages back. Now for the specifics.  I ordered the Cuban sandwich with a bowl of mushroom cream soup instead of fries.  Naturally it came with fries, but no big deal.  Our waitress quickly brought the soup and left the fries too.  The sandwich was long on bread and short on the rest.  Oh, it wasn't terrible.  Just average.  I would have preferred more ""Cuban"" and less ""sandwich"" though.  I didn't care for the soup, and found myself munching on the fries instead. My wife ordered angel hair pasta with shrimp.  It was a little dry so she asked for more sauce.  Again, not bad but definitely not good, either.  Her martini didn't fill the glass, although she reported that it tasted fine. We had crab dip as an appetizer and enjoyed it.  I'd say that was the highlight of our meal. Even more impressive than the huge menu would be if they delivered it all with quality. But the reality is, they fall a little short.  They have 100 choices or more, but nothing really stands out. There's no focus, and that drags everything down.  Even worse, the restaurant is famous for its cheesecake. And it is probably the best thing you can get, but it's buried under the weight of all the other mediocre food. To wrap this up, I'd like to recommend The Cheesecake Factory but I can't quite get there.  It's always looked fantastic from the outside, but once you get inside the reality doesn't match the aesthetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=60

Maya C.,"Madison, WI",0,1,4,3.0,4/29/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a place to indulge high calorie meals in a ""luxury"" Midwestern setting. The Cheesecake Factory in West Towne is slightly on the tacky side--with seating in the mall hallway and hostesses with tons of makeup, the restaurant is more of a casual dining place than a fancy, upscale restaurant. The atmosphere is not inviting: parties waiting to be seated are crowed around the entry space; the place is chaotic.          However, once I was seated after the usual 30-40 minute wait, my waiter was very friendly and the food came right away. All of the dishes are savory and rich, and the portion size is massive. I would recommend splitting an entree and a slice of the legendary cheesecake with a friend; you will have more than enough food. The only downside is the price: in my opinion, twenty dollars for a pasta dish is a bit too expensive. Overall, the Cheesecake Factory is a great place to try if you are starving, as I guarantee you will not be leaving hungry.

I seen people waiting to be seated with plenty of seats open, it looked disorganized and I walked away with a really bad feeling of the place.

Jason R.,"Madison, WI",0,3,2,1.0,2/26/2017,"Having lived in California almost exclusively I was so excited to find there was  a Cheesecake Factory in Madison having enjoyed the locations in Pasadena and Brentwood for years. Our first trip there wasn't bad...Not up to the quality of the Cali locations but pretty good.  Our second experience was a disaster. I ended up with food poisoning(my diagnosis not a doctor's, to be fair but I know that's what it was). I had a bacon cheeseburger and ordered it medium well. After my fourth bite my wife said, ""your burger looks raw!"" I looked and I saw a lot of pink. I will admit it tasted decent and I ate most of it mainly because I was starving and I knew how slow the service was so I'd probably wait 30 minutes or so for or a new one. My HUGE mistake! I ended up in the Sears bathroom feeling like Mike Tyson hit me in the gut about an hour later. I later became faint and ran a fever of 102. My wife tried to get me to go to the ER but I knew they'd only give me an IV of fluids and charcoal pills. So I proceeded to sweat it out, drenching our sheets and bed in sweat and spending every 30 minutes or so in our bathrooms for the next 18 hours. One more thing...And this was really bad...There was a mom and kid sitting at the bar eating Arby's(no joke). The mom ordered a drink and they proceeded to gobble up their fast food at the bar. I told our waiter that I worked in bars and restaurants in LA during college and that I had literally never seen that before and that it looked classless and was a joke that no one seemed to care. He said the manager had been told and had no problem with it. WTF? Almost every review on here from people who have eaten at other Cheesecake locations says this one is terrible in comparison. Things happen...I got sick and it could happen anywhere and I chose to continue eating a raw burger so it's partially my fault but the lack of caring of staff and management in allowing people to eat fast food at their bar is appalling.

Jillian C.,"Oregon, WI",3,7,,3.0,5/13/2016,"See update at end. This is a BAD review.  I don't like doing this but the customer service we just received (or lack thereof) from the Manager, Steve Shirvinski, was abysmal. We just came back from dining at The Cheesecake Factory.  This was only the second time I've eaten there.  The first time we were there was when they first opened.  The food and service were spectacular.  We were so impressed, I ended up buying over $200 in gift cards as Christmas gifts. One of the deals with the gift cards was that they came with a card that was good for a free piece of cheesecake.  I had really been looking forward to that slice and was saving it for a special occasion.  Tonight we were celebrating a big event, so it was finally the right time to use the card.  Unfortunately, I hadn't noticed the card expired 3/31. I knew there probably wasn't much chance that I'd be able to talk them into honoring the card at this late date but I wanted to give it a try.  I asked to speak to the manager so I could plead my case.  I was shocked when the waitress came back to the table to tell me THE MANAGER REFUSED TO EVEN SPEAK TO ME.  I pointed out to the waitress that this was really poor customer service on his part but all she could do was shrug her shoulders and apologize.  The manager shouldn't have put her in that position.  I felt sorry for her.  It  could have affected her tip (it didn't.) I don't know why the manager couldn't be bothered to talk to me.  I wouldn't have been mad if he'd still said the card had been expired too long if he'd at least heard me out.  His refusal to even talk to me is what has enraged me. So, guess what Steve Shirvinski, next Christmas there will be NO gift cards purchased from The Cheesecake Factory.  They will be purchased from your competitors.  Oh, and the next time I have something special to celebrate?  I'll be doing it some place else.  When people ask me for recommendations, I'll make a point of telling them NOT to go to your establishment. You've permanently lost a customer, just because you couldn't be bothered to give that little bit of customer service and hear me out. Update: I got a call at 9:30 this morning (the day after our dinner and my post) from Steve Shirvinski.  He apologized for our experience and said he was never made aware that I asked to speak to him.  He said he had recently honored some free slice coupons for another customer and that he wouldn't have refused to speak to me about the issue.  He plans to send me a written apology and a $25 gift certificate.  I've changed my review from 1 star to 3.  I'll give them another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=40

Friends, there are plenty of empty restaurants around if you want immediate seating!  Everything about Madison's Cheesecake Factory was on point and comparable to long established locations - except for the hostess and hostess stand. There needs to be immediate attention here because the hostess doesn't look up. Telling people to stand to the side for 40 minutes probably hundreds of times per shift seems ridiculous and could be why she is so surly. Post some signs or get some sort of dividers or something. If you can get past the discombobulated mess that is the first piece of the experience, it gets better. Server (Briana, I think) was prompt, thorough, energetic, and friendly. She knew about the menu. That's a pro who can answer as to what's on the plate but not listed in the menu. That helped me. When my Asian dish came out it was better looking than any other Asian dish I've had. Yes, the rice was a little heavy and fresh pineapple a little light but that's not the end of the world. As you know if you've ever been to TCF before, portions are huge. You're getting two servings whatever the dish is! Cakes and pies are huge, pretty, and tasty!  TCF Madison doesn't disappoint in the food. We will be back but hope some changes are made to the hostess/holding area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=40
Louis L.,"Madison, WI",112,1,1,1.0,10/23/2016,"Found a piece of plastic （巨大一块塑料）, a twist tie type item (see picture #130), in my mashed potatoes. I had taken about 5 bites of my food at this point, and I told my waiter. Unfortunately, both the manager and waiter were not very sympathetic or accommodating, and I didn't even get a real apology. My entree was taken off the bill, as it should have been, but the manager said they would only give me either a piece of cheesecake, or a half order of my entree, which was the Chicken Madeira. 就给我半份作补偿也太坑了吧，看得见的是一块塑料，谁知道还有什么看不见的都混在吃的东西里面......I am a big eater, so I left the Cheesecake Factory hungry still. It was already gross that a large twist tie had been melting in my mashed potatoes the entire time they were being cooked (the manager explained it had come from the bag of potatoes), and I wish the Cheesecake Factory had done a better job of making it right.

We wanted to buy a cake with only 8 pieces and they said we had to buy 12 pieces in order to be arranged as whole cake that can be cut. So we ordered six red velvet and six chocolate tower cake. When we finally got it, they were put in two separate boxes. The whole reason we bought 12 pieces in the first place was so it could be arranged as a cake. The guy that handed us the order was extremely rude when we asked him why they were put in two separate boxes.

Christine P.,"Madison, WI",15,26,,1.0,2/19/2016,"Summary: A 90 minute wait for subpar food and service and an injured child.  I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before. I had heard it was good, so we decided to check it out. The wait time on Friday evening was 90 minutes. This is understandable. What is not is watching tables be vacated and then seeing them sit dirty for 15 or more minutes before being flipped. On a busy night, that should be done within minutes.  We were seated in their 'outside the restaurant but inside the mall area' without being given a choice of where we'd like to sit (in or out). We had our 2 1/2 year old son with us and put his order for corndogs and fruit in right away. In the meantime, I had water,my husband ordered a mocha, and our son had chocolate milk. Our drinks took about 15 minutes to get to the table, as did the basket of bread. The waitress dropped off the drinks and the mocha was lukewarm, not hot. It took so long for us to get our drinks, that when the waitress finally dropped them off and took our order, my son's food was done and delivered to the table. This is important if you have children: do NOT get the corndogs, or if you do, remove the sticks before you let them have them. The sticks they use have pointy, sharp ends inside the hot dog. My son bit into his hot dog and ended up cutting the inside of his mouth. We didn't realize the extent of his injuries until we were home and he started crying while brushing his teeth. (My husband waited 15 minutes on the phone for a manager before he hung up and called back and demanded to speak to one).  Another aspect of the kid's meal we didn't like is how they did the fruit for the side. It was chopped up into teeny tiny pieces. Many little kids are picky eaters and won't eat something unless they can see what it is, which is why my son wouldn't eat it even though he loves all the fruits that were in the side. I would prefer larger chunks that are still manageable.  As for the adult food. I had the Skinnylicious Turkey and Avocado sandwich with a side salad and my husband ordered the gumbo. I expected a warm sandwich, and instead I received cold turkey, on a very cold bun, with cold bacon. My husband said his chicken and shrimp was overcooked. I tried a bite and the gumbo itself was pretty bland.  At the end of our meal, we had all our dirty dishes stacked at the end of our table for a good 10 minutes before our waitress came to check on us. This was pretty thematic throughout the meal. Our waitress was pretty scarce. We wanted some cheesecake, but since there was no wait staff around, my husband went to the wait station and grabbed a menu for us to review. When our server returned, it took 15 minutes to get 1 slice of cheesecake to go. Let's be clear, this is a pre-sliced cake that's been sitting on a plate in a display case. It should not take that long to put a slice in a to go container. We had our bill paid and were sitting and just waiting for our cheesecake to go.  The service was abysmal. Our waitress looked like half her section was in our 'outdoor' area and half indoors. This meant that she wasn't around much. Not once did a bus boy or other server stop by while we were waiting to check on us or clear our dirty plates. We did not see a manager during our entire time there.  TL;DR - skip the hype. The food is not worth the wait or the price. Check your kids food order if you do decide to risk it to ensure no dangerous, pointy items hiding in there.  The cheesecake was decent. So maybe call in an order for cheesecake to go, stop in and pick it up, and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home. Trust me, the service will be quicker and friendlier that way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=40
Eric V.,"Sun Prairie, WI",0,3,,5.0,1/11/2017,"Been here twice, first time I had the Mac & Cheese Burger which tasted like a giant salt ball that left me thirsty for hours on end afterwards.  Quite disappointment.  We received a gift card to go again, this time I had the White Chicken Chili which advertised a ""Generous"" amount of chili. Upon getting the dinner it was actually quite the small amount of chili especially with the price of $14.  Pretty disappointment for the amount of food and the cost, went home had some more food.  More of a personal preference, but I don't really enjoy cilantro, which I think was in the salsa they added to the chili.  Can't say I'm a fan of the salsa it in, it ruined the texture of the food.  Can't say that I will ever want to go back.  The wait staff was very friendly and that's the only reason I'm not giving it a 1 star.   Update: Went back and tried it again, had the Southwest Chicken panini (I have a hard time remembering the name) and it was really good.  Really enjoyed myself this time.  Wait staff, again was very friendly.

Christine L.,"Madison, WI",43,159,90,2.0,1/25/2016,"We came here as a large party of 10 at 1pm on a weekday and the wait was 1 hour! And they don't take reservations.  I ordered their appetizer of chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps. I was not impressed. It was bland, one note, and had none of the lightness that I had hoped in ordering a lettuce wrap. Instead, it came on a bed of rice noodle puffs and with lettuce that was hardly conducive to actual wrapping. The lettuce was stalky and would have been better if I was eating it with a dip. Big leafy lettuce for lettuce wraps, please, like the kind that Vietnamese restaurants know to provide with their egg rolls. Moreover, the chicken and mushroom filling for my wrap looked brown and unappetizing. A bit of color would've made it more appealing, like some red bell peppers or green onions.  Plus the chicken was dry.  The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their food though a couple of others also commented that some of their dishes were bland. Many of us ordered cheesecakes to go, but it took FOREVER. We even asked our waitress whether we should put in our to go orders as we put in our dine in order, and she said that we could do it at the end when we're ready for the check. So we did that, but then waited another good 30 minutes after paying the check for our to go orders to come out. It's no wonder the wait is so long to get seated here. Also, because we all ordered different kinds of cheesecakes, they brought it out to us but didn't label them or tell us what they were. It took some deduction on our part to figure which ones went with whom.   The one bright spot was the key lime cheesecake I took home. Perfectly tart yet rich and buttery on the tongue. It was decadent. I savored each bite and wished I had also ordered the salted caramel cheesecake.  It seems that people were very excited about Cheesecake Factory showing up in Madison, so maybe the wait will die down after a few months and they will figure out to make the service more efficient. Personally, I would not come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=40

Food is good, however, both my food and my husband's food were cold.  I had the chicken soft tacos, which have good flavor.  They describe them as spicy, however, I didn't detect any spiciness to them.  Rice was overcooked and hard.  My husband had the Cheesesteak and his was cold as well.  We were in a hurry since we had to get somewhere, so we didn't say anything and ate our food.  We ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and we waited for 15 minutes before we finally just left.  How does it take 15 minutes to get a piece of cheesecake to go?  I tried flagging the other waitstaff down to check on my cheesecake and not one person glanced my way.

Michelle F.,"Madison, WI",59,186,41,1.0,12/22/2015,"Like several reviewers here, I have been to Cheesecake Factory restaurants in other locations, enjoyed my various experiences, and was excited to see one land in Madtown.  But...oh, boy... The place was hopping at noon on the Monday before Christmas--admittedly one of the busiest times we could have possibly chosen. Lucky for me, my party was already seated in the bar when I arrived. The decor seemed swanky and modestly cool, but the first thing that struck me as I sat down was that the bar tables are far too small for a party of four to comfortably sit and eat lunch (amazingly, though, no disasters with water glasses or plates happened during our meal). The noise level was really quite uncomfortable. My party had ordered nachos as an appetizer, which gave me some time to peruse the menu and order. Quite a bit more time, it turned out, than I needed. 35 minutes later, the nachos arrived, followed shortly after (5 minutes) by our entrees. Our waitress, to her credit, was clearly annoyed that the food had arrived as it did.  Back to my order. It was foggy and miserable outside, so I was in the mood for comfort food. I am a sucker for Shepherd's Pie, which I ordered despite the misnomer: SHEPherds herd what? SHEEP. Like, uh, lamb. (C'mon man, ground beef makes it COTTAGE pie! But, whatever.) When the entree arrived, it looked fine, albeit with an entire parsley sprig plopped unceremoniously on top (I tore off some leaves and shredded them over the dish).  But my first bite revealed the insidious truth: hiding out beneath the copious mashed potatoes and gravy was...not ground beef. Not in the traditional sense. You see, my dish appeared to be a subterfuge for hamburger patties that had not made the cut at the grill (it didn't take much for my imagination to slide to the slimy bottom of that slippery slope--GAAAACK!). Many of the huge chunks of torn-up patty were burnt on one side or both, and all of them were quite bland. (Which made me wonder about the quality of the hamburgers--but I'll leave that for some other hapless patron to review!) A few vegetables had been tossed in and the mix was slathered in gravy, then cleverly hidden under fluffy mounds of cheesy mashed potatoes. After a few bites of this vile concoction, I ate enough of the mashed potatoes to fill me up--as in, the part that was not in contact with the slop--and left the rest. There were no questions from the waitress when she took my almost entirely slop-filled plate. It didn't matter, because I would not have ordered anything else: I was too grossed out. The very idea of re-purposed food makes me gag. So...to recap. Long wait. Loud. Slow service. Expensive. Truly sub-par food.  Sounds like a job for Kitchen Nightmares.

My friend and I stopped in for a few cocktails and some appetizers between 7:30-8:00pm while our sons were at a Build-A-Bear birthday party in the mall--John C. was our server. There was a huge snowstorm going on outside, so the place was dead--we had the entire bar to ourselves. There was no friendly smile or hello as we sat down--John greeted us with, ""What can I get you?"" before we'd even taken our coats off or put our packages and purses down. We didn't know what we were thirsty for, so we asked for suggestions. He reluctantly offered a few, which we took. While the drinks were good, the glasses were loaded with ice...and even with that being the case, mine was still a good half inch from being a full glass. I decided not to complain, but I was finished in literally 6-8 sips. When he asked if I wanted another, I said yes, but requested that he didn't put any more ice in the glass. This time, it came back with a good inch of liquid missing. When I questioned him about it, he pointed out there was less ice this time, and when I replied that the last drink even with all the ice wasn't full, he became surly and outright rude, telling me I ""just needed to trust he was making the drink right."" When I tried to explain I wasn't questioning the WAY he made the drink but rather HOW MUCH was in the glass each time, he proceeded to interrupt me and talk over me, not letting me finish a sentence. His poor attitude put a serious damper on our evening. My friend had ordered us some appetizers, and rather than stay, we opted to have them boxed up to go as soon as they were delivered. The bill came, and John did nothing to compensate us for his short-change on my drinks. We left upset and, frankly, feeling unfulfilled--we'd so been looking forward to a relaxing hour without the kids with some terrific food and cocktails, but honestly John C.'s lack of customer service and unfriendly demeanor really ruined it for us. We ADORE the Cheesecake Factory, having been to this and many of its other locations over the years, but this type of treatment left a very sour taste in my mouth--if I do end up returning to this location, I'll never sit at the bar again, and will closely monitor all drinks coming from there to ensure the glasses are full.

Andrew L.,"Middleton, WI",0,4,5,1.0,1/16/2016,"If you have a spare four hours, have lots of patience, and don't mind spending a lot of money for average food, this might be your go to chain restaurant. We wanted to make a reservation for Thursday night (1-14-16), for ten. We were told that company policy didn't allow reservations, even for large groups. My wife asked how long it would likely take if we showed up at 6:00. She estimated 45 minutes. My daughter arrived at 6:00 and put in a reservation for ten and was told it would be around 7:15. (75 minutes rather then 45). No big deal. We go to the bar and 7:30 rolls around. I wander through the restaurant and notice that they are severely limited on large tables and that none of the large tables are close to being done. We talk to the manager and he estimates it will be another 5 minutes. What did the manager see that I didn't? A little bit before 8 we get buzzed, get our group together including an elderly person with a walker, and are informed that the table is not ready but that he wants to give us an update. He puts the blame on customers who are taking too long to leave (we later learn it is really due to really slow service). The manager orders us two complimentary appetizers at the bar where we have already spent over $150. A single crown royal on the rocks runs $10, and the menu includes no prices for drinks. We finally getter seated at 8:15. This is an hour after we were told the table would be ready and two hours and fifteen minutes after we arrived. This better be good. Our waitress was pleasant and expressed an understanding of our long wait but then proceeded to do nothing to make up for the poor service. Honestly, I have never seen a restaurant do a worse job of turning tables. There was almost always 5-6 tables that were not cleared, or were empty. The manager told me he was aware of this issue. Our orders didn't get taken until 8:30,  and our food didn't arrive until 9:00. I ordered the steak tacos. The black beans were stone cold, the rice and tacos were barely warm. At this point I had talked to the manager twice and was simply starving. I should have sent it back but didn't. The cheesecake we ordered was average at best and took for ever to arrive. My son ordered a slice that they were out of. Long story short? We got out of there at nearly 10:00. It's not the customers that are causing tables to be occupied for 90 minutes. I thought maybe something besides the two appetizers would be comped. They were not. No apology from anyone when we left. Our food bill and tip was over $270 plus a bar tab of over $150. So....we spent about $42 a person for a four hour miserable experience. Any restaurant that knew what they were doing, would have given us a small gift card to give them a second chance on a better night.  It amazes me that this place is this busy. I have been to the Chesecake factory in in Chicago and don't recall these problems. I suspect that after the novelty wears off, that people will go to the many other restaurants in Dane County. While waiting for our table, I shared my observations with the manager and asked him if he had read any of the negative reviews on-line. He said that he had and that corporate was also well aware of the problems. You will notice that management doesn't appear to respond to any reviews on-line.

Chy R.,"Madison, WI",957,474,1492,3.0,11/30/2015,"5:00 pm Our party of 4 arrived at the Cheesecake Factory, located across from Sephora at West Town Mall. Was handed a buzzer and told the wait time was around 30 min.  5:15 pm Pleasantly surprised to feel the buzzer going off. We walked back and waited as instructed on the side of the hostess desk to be seated. We were greeted by our hostess and proceeded to follow her to the exterior dining patio area only to see the table bestowed on us was not cleared off and therefore not ready. We marched back to where the hostesses converge and given another buzzer on a cusp promise of a short wait. 5:20 pm We were herded to our real table now, conveniently 10 feet from the hostess beehive and in front of the Cheesecake counter area of the restaurant. 5:25 pm Our server appears along with another gentleman whom I cannot distinguish between a manager or a server-in-training. We were given menus and drink orders (three waters and an ice tea) taken. 5:30 pm Our drinks appear and we are asked if we would like their complimentary bread basket. We are agreeable. Our group ordered the Clam chowder soup of the day as well as the mini corn dogs to start. 5:45 pm Our orders are jotted and bread basket are served. We received two baskets of a crusty sourdough and a soft dark bread, which tasted like a honey wheat brown bread, this was the star in our group.  5:55 pm We asked for refills for both the drinks and bread. Our soup and mini corn dogs arrive. The corn dogs was one-length hot dog at one time, cut into four sections, dipped in cornmeal batter and fried to perfection. Strangely this was served with mustard and it took another couple of minutes to try to flag a waitstaff (not ours) down for ketchup. The chowder was delicious, meaty pieces of clam and potatoes in a thick, creamy base. 6:25 pm As we waited with baited breath, a woman in a black blazer comes to our table to reassure us that she saw our food and it will arrive ""within a couple of minutes"". 6:40 pm Three of the four entrees grace our table. We are given a promise that the fourth entree, Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi would be arriving shortly. Alas! The fourth arrives three minutes later. The Chipotle Chicken Pasta was strangely sweet, it had an aftertaste of chipotle, but was otherwise not spicy as the menu indicated. There were sufficient amount of chicken, that was again strangely soft, almost too tender. Two people ordered the Steak Diane, one as the meal and one as a combination with shrimp scampi. This was a standout in our group. Succulent, flavorful, medallions of Angus beef steak were bathed in black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce. It was perfectly smothered in caramelized onions and baby portobello and shiitake mushrooms. Both arrived with mashed baby lusciously lumpy red potatoes. The shrimp scampi were not what we had in mind, as lightly sauté minimalist. Instead these were almost breaded and pan fried. I am not complaining, but again, just strange as expectations from the menu described as sautéed did not meet reality.  Another solid dish was their Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. It came with Andouille sausage, juicy chunks of tomato, diced peppers, onions, and garlic, topped with a generous portion of white rice. I am having a hard time reconciling with the chicken, it's again a little too rubbery for me. I did appreciate the medium sized peeled and deveined shrimp.  7:15 pm We asked for a to-go box and the cheesecake menu (the variety is over a pages long). Since we were familiar with the pace of service, we asked for the bill as well. 7:20 pm The bill and boxes arrive, but no cheesecake menu. In hindsight, we could have just grabbed one ourselves, being seated so close to the hostess podium. However, in our mode of glutton, we simply could not be motivated to do so. 7:25 pm We flagged another waitress and she handed us a menu. I wonder if she saw the disparity in our eyes, as we metaphorically clung to her. We decided on the Sea Salt Caramel ($7.95).  7:30 pm Again, we are seated in front of the pre-made, cheesecake variety display. We were once again told that our cheesecake is coming while nothing appeared in front of us. 7:35 pm The cheesecake makes its appearance like an overzealous celebrity. It's what you dreamed of seeing, you have great expectations of this individual, you clearly overpaid for the privilege of experiencing this event live, but it disappoints you and even annoy you a bit by arriving late and have the appearance of their bad, ugly, meme. The cheesecake was the frozen version of what you can get at Sam's, but on steroids, if steroids were a layer of condensed cake underneath the cheesecake.  As you can see it took well over 2 hours for the entire dinner.There were no adjustments to our bill for the tardy service nor any acknowledgement of the room temp Steak Diane, all in all, it was $104 for four people before tip.  We came, we conquered, and the hype defeated us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=20

She admitted that she had forgot to put our order in.  Egads!  We had already been waiting 45 minutes during a not so particularly busy time. When are bill came, I expected to see a small discount or similar due to her error that she admitted to. But no. The food was fine for the most part, a little on the pricey side for what it was.

Alan K.,"Madison, WI",90,107,360,4.0,6/24/2016,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory location. I typically try hard to avoid restaurants in shopping malls. But today, I figured life is short so wanted to give it a go to expand my horizons.  We enjoyed it pretty well.  This location is in West Town Mall. It faces the parking lot so there is plenty of parking and big signs to identify and where to enter the restaurant.  I was surprised at how beautiful the restaurant is. It is upscale'ish with white linens but casual. They have outdoor seating, a very nice bar area and a variety of different types of tables. We were greeted and seated promptly by our hostess and our waitress followed close behind. We were there for lunch and the menu given to us was  large and extensive.  Nice! Another nice touch was a basket of warm sourdough and whole wheat bread which came out with our drink order.  Being my first visit, and still being on a quest for the best burger in town, I had to order their standard cheeseburger and fries as a litmus test.  Dining partner had a Cuban sandwich. Frankly, I was not expecting much figuring everything must come out of the back of a Sysco truck. But I was pleasantly surprised. My burger seem to be hand formed, was cooked to my requested medium doneness, and served on a sourdough baguette with grilled onions and tomato.  The beef could have been seasoned more but it did taste fresh. The onions were cooked perfectly and the sourdough bread toasted just right. The fries were very good as well.  All told, it was pretty good.   I am told that the Cuban sandwich was also very good, with the pickle within it being of particular mention.  For the prices, our entrées were smaller than would be expected.  We had to try a piece of cheesecake. As expected, their cheesecake selection is extensive. We went with the banana cream cheesecake which was also very good. (Note - - they have a bakery area where you can purchase baked goods to go).  A nicely sliced banana garnished the cheesecake. I was impressed that the banana was perfectly sliced and perfectly ripe. Neither over nor underripe.  I give them credit for that attention to detail. Good for them! It is appreciated.  Our lunch entrées were about $13 each.  Little high for a burger and sandwich here in Madison. Although the food quality was strong, I'm not convinced it was quite proportionate to the cost per Madison standards. For our entrées, one slice of cheesecake and one soft drink, our bill was about $40, before tax and tip. The space is beautiful, clean, with friendly and helpful staff.  For me, a nice place to bring my mom or grandma for lunch or if I was from out of town and needed a safe and solid bet for good food in a relaxed but upscale'ish setting.  As mentioned, I don't expect much from restaurants in shopping malls. But today I was pleasantly surprised and I'm indeed  better for it.  Now that I'm on a roll, on to The Red Lobster (ahem)!   For what it is, a strong Yelp four stars. See you there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=20

Kris D.,"Madison, WI",48,85,117,4.0,6/12/2016,"For me, The Cheesecake Factory works.  I like the big menu though I tend to stick to a few favorites.  The food is always impressive and delicious.  Yes, it is a little pricey and corporate is probably raking in a tidy sum, but I generally love eating out and the high prices just means I won't be here quite as much, but I will make the pilgrimage a few times a year. People talk about the high calorie entrees, but the ""Skinny-licious"" menu solves all this.  I usually order off of that menu to either save room for dessert or because I'm watching my calories and I have never been disappointed.  Everything I've ordered off that menu is excellent  and I can't believe I'm eating a low-cal meal. Also enjoy the bread basket -- the darker bread (rye/pumpernickel?) rocks.  The standard bread is good, but not as much as the other in my opinion. I'm sure it's no surprise to anyone that the cheesecake selection is impressive.  When we do treat ourselves, one slice for the two of us is all we need.  Yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=20
John G.,"Madison, WI",27,139,75,2.0,4/22/2016,"Hmm, I've heard really good things about this chain from people I trust, but I am not buying what they're selling.  I went to the Bayshore Mall Milwaukee location and now this new one in Madison, and experiences were pretty similar. I'll be straight-forward, this restaurant just seems like an overpriced mess of dishes with little to no direction on the overall experience.  Walking in, they clearly had way too many employees, as most of them were standing around talking to each other or walking right by tables that needed attention but for some reason weren't getting it. Thankfully our personal server was extremely friendly and also quite helpful (I believe his name was Jeremiah).  My Dad and I had no idea what to order as we paged through their Tom Clancy sized novel of a menu, but he had 4-5 recommendations that all sounded up our alley and answered questions as they came.  I settled on the Teriyaki Chicken for a whopping $17.  It was tasty and the portion size was agreeably large.  I think for that amount of money I'd rather be wowed a bit, but I can't complain too much because I did still enjoy the dish.  Complimentary bread was also noice, and overall made up for the bizarro-land atmosphere inside and equally crazy menu. I think this might be the spot to go for large groups where you have potentially picky eaters, as there's no way someone will go hungry, but I'd be hard pressed to find another excuse.  Maybe I'm being too harsh as the food is reasonable (and was so in Milwaukee too) but I'd like to see them do something with the open space and show a bit more attentiveness to the tables as a whole (again, not our server but in general).  It's early in the going for them though, so time will tell. . .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=20

I would come back anytime babeee ;) I have tried many dishes and they all have been tasty, well seasoned and had satisfied my dear tummy.  Portions tend to be large and in case you are not that hungry, you can always get something from their lunch menu (served until 5:00pm) and they have a nice variety of dishes.  My favorite ones, tan taaann: * The old fashioned burger, nicely charred and very tasty! * Shrimp with Angel hair (I switch it for Penne pasta, personal preference) great fresh taste with lots of crushed tomatoes, lemon, garlic and a touch of basil and thyme.  * The grilled Salmon is always flaky and delicious! One of my top favorites :) it comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli but you can have other sides upon request. I like the mashed potatoes, carrots and green beans, I think the broccoli is very bland.  I also discovered a cocktail that I shouldn't have asked for! The reason? I fell in love with it but it's expensive, $10.50 :( it's called Ruby red crush (Vodka, lime, grapefruit juice, St Germain), it was a little bit strong, but so delicate made, I could taste every single ingredient and so perfect for summertime!  Service has always been good and I appreciate that. For me, the Cheesecake Factory is part of the the restaurant list that my boyfriend and I like to visit, yes, you guessed right, the one we always fight for because it's hard to choose from!

Tara Z.,"Madison, WI",6,18,13,3.0,5/8/2016,"We went here with a large group for my brother-in-law's birthday. We arrived around 1:30 & left around 4. I walked in the hostess desk had just cleared of customers and the one hostess did not ask what I needed, I was ignored. Two groups came through the mall entrance and she spoke with them. A woman customer behind me asked if I had been helped and I replied no. A minute later another hostess arrived and offered to help me, then a third hostess arrived and seemed puzzled. It appeared no one but us was waiting, after 50 or more minutes of waiting we were seated. Drink orders were taken promptly, alcohol arrived first, water took 5 minutes, soda, coffee, and tea arrived 20 minutes after sitting. Tables were small 2-4 top tables.  The server did not ask of we were ready to order, she rushed off. There was a lot of waiting. The portions were very large.  The Childrens Mac and cheese should have included a smaller portion of noodles & a large side of veggies. It needed less salt, no parmesan cheese, and no cheese chunks inside the noodles. This child whose favorite order is Mac could not stomach the mac. (Win for mom, got to share some delicious salmon, rice, and broccoli) The kids mini corn dogs arrived with 3 corn dogs and an adult portion of extra salty fries. The corn dogs dos not classify as mini they were shorter and fatter but the same amount of food as one normal corn dog. The dog inside was greasy, and disgusting but 2 of the 3 were eaten by the child who ordered. My sister and I both selected salmon from the lunch menu, priced about $15. My sister chose the herb crusted, accompanied by mashed potatoes and 4 sprigs of asparagus. The salmon which looked like a patty was on a mountain of mashed potatoes. She enjoyed the salmon, the rest was okay. My grilled salmon lunch portion had an accompaniment of mashed potatoes and broccoli. The potatoes could be traded out for brown rice, the veggies could be replaced for an up-charge. The platter it arrived on was full, half or more of rice 4-6 servings of rice. Less than a full serving of broccoli unlike the asparagus I received more than 4 flowerettes. And a good size, well seasoned salmon steak. I enjoyed the cooked broccoli and brown rice. For information purposes  it was not seasoned at all. My brother-in-law orders the Philly cheese steak & fries finishing half.  My father ordered the Cobb salad which should be equal portions of different toppings. It was a shredded lettuce salad with some tomato, some cheese, a few scraps of meat, and a chunk of avocado. They state tossed but they do not state the ingredient portions aren't equal. -not a Cobb salad. My uncle ordered the jambalaya which was in a very large dish as well. The flavors were great, a bit of a bite to it. My one complaint is that I didn't expect it to have oil in it. Everything in the dish was covered with an oily film. The lemon drop Martini was addictive  The regular coffee was good, I wouldn't visit for the coffee though. The decaf coffee was quite bitter, it's flavor was a bit unpleasant. I could only drink the water after eating, it had an aroma of chlorine and tasted odd. Some flavors were spot on, portions were odd, ingredients were odd. Salmon & mashed potatoes for lunch. 4 sprigs of asparagus. Jambalaya in oil. Cobb salad 90% shredded lettuce. Kids mac loaded in cheddar, parmesan, and added salt with no veggie. 3 giant kids ""mini"" corn dogs with an adult sized fry no veggie option. Half a plate of rice.   We requested one Childrens Hot fudge sundae which was, not brought out, then after the bill was given we had a sad kiddo, requested it again as the bill was being paid, when it arrived it was enough for 2-3 children. Loaded with whipped cream. Lots of waiting. Food was placed in front of the wrong people (by people helping our server) The server was well informed of the menu and options and pleasant. More pleasant than the 3 hostesses.  **Three stars because if I were eating anything but my meal I would have been disappointed. But my food was good and the server was pleasant and able to answer my questions. This helped me receive something satisfying for my taste.**",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=20
Tim C.,"Madison, WI",0,30,9,4.0,6/29/2017,"Okay let's get on my tinsy winsy soap box for a moment.  My guess as to some of the low star reviews for the CheeseCake Factory at the WestTowne Mall in Madison, Wis. is related to trained labor or shortages of same.  In 2017 almost all service jobs in this city have help wanted signs out and this for a while.   Also I'd have to say if there is turn over at any restaurant almost anywhere in USA that compensation is directly associated as the main factor. IMO.  If you have seen my other reviews I've mentioned the compensation methods of USA wait staffs everywhere is the target reason for turnover.  Even restaurants get what they pay for.  Okay, off soap box now.   - - - - - - - - - - Begin review - - - - - - - - -  As the Shopping Mall era keeps setting into the sunset in lieu of the big online phenomena, I could make a case that restaurants like the Cheesecake factory are evolving into the new anchor stores, I mean the others all seem to be singing Anchors Aweigh.  So if an old guy like me will go to a mall for the Cheesecake Factory it's got to be a good reason.  Duhhh.  Even though our Factory here in Madison seems more marketed to women, I don't mind a bit, I can coffee and chit chat too, even order off the ' Skinnylicious ' menu, speaking of menus I also don't mind the main menu being a Book!, It's called selection.  (If you think I'm overdoing the dead mall syndrome, check out Dan Bell and his Youtube series ' Dead Mall Series ', yes people, it's a thing.)  - - - - - - - - - - - So, my fav dish was the Thai Salmon with rice (extra butter, Hey! this is Wis. and the place is called ' CheeseCake --- ', so don't go there!) tasty sauce and nicely done veggies of the Asian style flavors, Oh, just--love--that--dish!  Unfortunately our CCFactory has discontinued that particular salmon dish, (almost always ordered that dish) but there are several others with similar fixins and making your own construction is allowed, and, will mention here, if things go wrong, you tell them about it and it should or will be fixed NOW.    So this allowed me to order special salads which I also have enjoyed.  The coffee is okay, not great but not bad either, seems restaurants have trouble keeping great coffee on request, so this is another plus for CCF.  Need I mention the desserts or complete takeout desserts since usually can't stuff any more in the pie hole by end of entré time.  So the CCF being right in a mall can also be handy for any kind of other errands nearby.  Confession: When we travel across country we keep running into Starbucks and Cheesecake factories, just seems to keep happening.  I blame it on the internet.   Others seem unimpressed (millennials?) with this cheesecake factory, I'll blame that on the general lowered expectations of younger generations who don't know what to make of excess when they see it.  Having choices and enjoying same is a real adventure, but considering the future picture of USA, I can see them being depressed and unable to enjoy a restaurant style that is disappearing quickly in this newer age.  To me the Cheesecake Factory is a blast from the past to be enjoyed, and for a mall, a destination.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=20

Jae M.,"Madison, WI",45,164,119,4.0,3/11/2016,"I was really happy finding out that they were opening a Cheesecake Factory in Madison. Being from CA, having this built made me feel super nostalgic. I've been to the Milwaukee location but too far for a casual last minute dinner decision.  Anyway, been at this location a few times, but our most memorable visit was a few nights ago when we celebrated my husband's and father-in-law's birthdays.  Dana was our server. She started off a little MIA (had to ask other servers for water refills and straws) but as the night went on, she was more attentive. My husband ordered the shepherd's pie and to all our surprise, it looked really greasy. He ordered his usual BBQ smokehouse burger cooked to perfection and was much happier with his choice.  Out of nowhere, the manager (Quinn) came by to ask us how we were doing and to make sure my husband was satisfied with his meal. His words were: ""I wanted to make sure you leave happy.""

Gemma B.,"Fitchburg, WI",48,63,23,3.0,7/25/2016,"I'd like to start off by saying this location is far better than the location in Schaumburg.  So that's out of the way. Their menu is huge. Ridiculously so. That has its ups and downs. It takes you a bit to decide on what you actually want to order, but there's probably something for everyone with a wide range of selection. Normally on a huge menu, quality suffers, but I don't really feel like that's an issue here. The issue is getting orders right. That being said, it would be nice if they'd pick a genre and stick with it.  The items on the menu are super caloric and they are a bit overpriced. I exclusively order from the Skinnylicious menu at this point, but it's been hit or miss. I love love love their Ahi Tartare. I've tried other items off of that menu with mixed results. I find some of the dishes, while low in calories, have a super high sodium content. I do recommend that tartare though. It's fresh and awesome.  The problem areas with this restaurant tend to be the staff and the kitchen. The staff is always super friendly, but they're also very busy so service can suffer there. I've also had issues with making special requests, and the server getting it wrong. (I'm not pretentious, I have an allergy). When the servers aren't overwhelmed and making mistakes because of it, the kitchen picks up that mantle. As much as I love that tartare it has come out differently every time I've ordered it. It's got very few things involved on it, so you'd think replicating iy roughly the same each time would be easy.  I'd love to talk about the cheesecake, but it's really hard for me to find any that doesn't have nuts in it. The two times I have ordered any, there was some confusion about it having nuts or not. So I'm not the person to ask about that.  Overall, it's not a bad place, but it's also not great.

The food is not good...you would think that since it is a chain the food should taste exactly the same at each restaurant.  Every time we have visited this location the food has been bland and just ""off"".  Another reason I am only leaving one star is that the customer service (or lack there of) has been awful.  Even when the restaurant is empty the service has been slow.  The worst experience that we had when eating here was when we came in for an early dinner (5pm) and didn't receive our food until almost 6!  The place was empty so there was absolutely no reason that the food should have been that delayed.  On top of that, our waitress forgot to put in one item from our order.  We complained to the manager and he offered NO apology...simply gave a fake smile and nodded.  Perhaps he wasn't paying attention because he was too busy socializing with the gals up front so he couldn't be bothered to hear us out.

No attention to detail at all but our waitress seemed to have loads of time to talk with coworkers at a nearby work station. Food was good as usual but I have now given up on this place.

My favorite part of this place along with mine and my husbands experience is a waiter name Adam Cooley! He is a great catch! I can tell he really enjoys what he does and was so on point with everything. Adam made our experience the best experience ever since it was my husbands first time at any cheesecake factory.

Ben G.,"Middleton, WI",0,4,,1.0,1/31/2016,"An overpriced meal from chef Mike (Microwave). We had a the fried cheese, and stuffed mushroom appetizers. Then a club sandwich and french dip for entrees. And we each snagged a piece of cheesecake togo (Strawberry and dulce de leche). Positives:  - My wife enjoyed her Strawberry cheesecake  - We wound up being two people at a booth meant for six. Was kinda nice having a bit more personal space, considering how crowded and busy the place was. Negatives:  - Bit of a wait to get seated (25-30 min), but it was busy so I can't fault them for that. However I had a follow-up question after talking to the hostess and she decided to talk to a waiter about his day for 15 minutes instead of turn her head and help answer my question. Luckily a waitress came by and helped me out.  - The place was packed and the seating is done in such a way that made me feel like I was one sardine in a can. The big booth we got seated in helped out, but it was unfortunately right next to a server station, so the traffic right outside my booth was fast and plenty. Getting seated and leaving that spot made me feel like a cyclist in L.A. traffic.  - The appetizers were microwave meals. The mushrooms were a rubbery, bland, solid mass. The fried cheese was bland and the marinara dipping sauce was watery soup.  - The club was a bland stack covered in miracle whip.  - The french dip came with a shot glass amount of dip and the beef was about as low grade as you could get. Tearing threw the fat and sinew with my teeth turned my meal into a challenge.  - The fries had no seasoning and came to us about 15 minutes after our entrees got there.  - My dulce de leche cheesecake was a bit of a sad, bland mess as well. If you think about it, when you boast over 250 menu items, how would you expect a chef to be able to keep fresh, quality ingredients for every one of those around, as well as be able to hone and refine every one of those dishes? I believe you can't, which worsens an experience that their layout already makes dismal. I'm looking forward to avoiding this place like the plague in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=120

Deborah C.,"Madison, WI",26,16,10,1.0,12/21/2015,"We rolled up to the Cheesecake Factory at around noon. They were running at about 40 minutes wait for a table, but my family and I were lucky enough to snag bar seating. I sat down and ordered a Bloody Mary and a plate of nachos for an appetizer. When my Bloody Mary arrived, it looked (and tasted) like watered down tomato juice with a solitary celery stalk waving hello. Barely any spices were added and I almost wondered if they forgot a little something something. Strike 1. The nachos were decent. Nothing special, but passable bar food nonetheless. For my meal I ordered the ""shepherd's pie"" (though with ground beef instead of lamb it was more of a cottage pie). Lunch came out almost on top of the appetizers. Strike 2. Oh well, no biggie really. Initially, the meal looked promising with red potato skins in the mashed potatoes, julienned carrots, and parsley. Unfortunately, I was in for a nasty surprise. It turns out when the Cheesecake Factory says ""ground beef"", they really mean ""huge chunks of crumbled up hamburger patty"". I also have  a sneaking suspicion that they save the hamburger patties they really screwed up for the dubious honor of being covered with gravy and hidden in mashed potatoes. The patty used in my meal was blackened and crispy on the bottom. They tell you that activated charcoal is great for detoxification. Well, based on the hunk of carbon I just snacked on, I should be rid of any toxins I've come into contact with for the last ten years. Not delicious. Hey batter batter. He swings, he misses.

Dara D.,"Waunakee, WI",0,4,1,1.0,11/17/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory in Madison Wi.... stay clear. I happen to love the franchise but tonight I had the worst, most racist experience ever. I've always thought Cheesecake Factory was a family restaurant, which is why I didn't hesitate to bring my daughter in this evening with friends and family to celebrate her 10th Birthday. Well, where do I start?! We were seated by a party of 3 that complained from the time we sat down, rolling their eyes saying rude shit about kids, never asking to be moved. Mind you, we're in a family restaurant with a party of 10. I hear the rude ass waitress apologizing to the party while pointing, whispering and making faces at the kids. Next the manager comes over and proceeds to comp their entire meal. So as he's walking away, we say ""excuse me, the is a family restaurant right?"" The music is blaring and the voice level is average... he says of course we are, or waitstaff just should have done a better job at putting them in a more private area. A private area in a public restaurant?! How so? So I ask, will our meals be comped as well for us being seated by a very rude, racist party that constantly gave our children dirty looks and whispered loud enough that they too were uncomfortable? Of course not... so again, why are they being comped for choosing to go to a public restaurant and dining amongst the public? Our waitress dropped our drinks... were we accommodated in any way? So I'm still looking for the answer, is this a family restaurant?!  We're here spending hundreds of dollars and being treated like we marched past the whites only sign. Never will I ever patronize this place again. I will be contacting regional managers, CEO's and whomever else. I also intend on speaking with my attorney tomorrow. I'm disgusted and anyone with a family should take their money elsewhere and I intend on making everyone that I know",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=120

We ordered fish and fries - the fish was a little dry, no ketchup was brought to the table and we had to flag down the waitress. We also ordered the chicken burrito, it was just OK. It needed more spices and the guacamole appeared as though it had been sitting out. The free bread was very good, the Key Lime cheesecake was also very good.

Norma F.,"Waterloo, WI",0,4,,1.0,5/12/2016,"We went there because I wanted some really good fried catfish.  Having lived in southern Missouri before moving to Wisconsin over a year ago, I have been looking for a good catfish dinner.  When I saw ""Southern Fried Catfish, Farm Raised, Lightly Breaded and Fried Crisp"", listed on The Cheesecake Factory's menu, I couldn't wait to go try it.  Well, I can tell you it is nothing at all like real Southern Fried Catfish - I'd give it a 1 compared to real Southern Fried Catfish a 10.  It was in 3 chunk pieces and not lightly breaded, but heavy corn meal fried dark brown, and the fish wasn't done in the middle, because it didn't ""flake"" when you tried to cut it.  I actually took most of it home to finish cooking it properly because I didn't want to eat fish that was not fully cooked (fried), and we never send food back to be fixed, because of what might happen to it back in the kitchen. The mashed potatoes were good, but the green beans were almost raw and the corn was pretty dry. This meal was definitely not worth $17.95.  And, please don't think their ""Southern Fried Catfish"" is anything like the real thing because it isn't.  I guess you have to go south to get the really good, pond raised, catfish, sliced in long pieces, lightly breaded and fried to a light golden brown - it is so good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=120

Our server started out friendly, then everything went downhill. She took our order, brought some bread. We had to ask 3 times to get my daughter's drink. The food came out and an expediter tried to give my daughter salmon, I told her that we ordered grilled chicken for the chilc. So she shoved the plate at me again and said, OH yes, this is the chicken.  I looked at it and said, no, it isn't,  that is salmon. You were right the first time, but it is still not what we ordered. Another person sat my steak in front of me and a dish of mashed potatoes.  They took my daughters food back to try again. My husbands food came with a 3rd person about 5 minutes later. My potatoes were cold, steak was close to the doneness that I had ordered. The server took the potatoes to get fresh. Then they returned with my daughters plate, which now had a 1x2 inch piece of grilled chicken that was about 1/4 inch thick and had clearly been cut from another piece. So we had ordered grilled chicken, broccoli and fries. She got chicken, broccoli and carrots. Veggies were ice cold. Eventually my potatoes came back hot on top and cold inside.  Both hubby and I had ordered the ribs eyes but we're not given knives to cut it with. Hubby's fries were cold as well.  Server said she was sorry and would get a manager. After 10 minutes waiting on manager to come, hubby got up to find one.... Jeremy, a manager, came back to the table with him and we explained the debacle that had been our meal so far. He asked us what we wanted him to do!!! He said he would take off the kids meal and some other things to make it right. When the bill came, he had comped the children's meal and nothing else.

With a whopping $80 bill, I made sure to tip our server (who was not around for most of the serving) $12.00 to ensure she was at least taken care of for her troubles.   Thank you,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-madison?start=100
