Mario P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,3,5.0,8/19/2016,Awesome experience! As we walked inside  cheese cake factory my friend I had the awesome experience to be greeted by Joe the restaurant manager! He is amazing! Extremely nice and with great customer service! Gorgeous smile! Super handsome! He sat us right away in table . The food was well served and the food had a great taste! My pasta was Delicious. To make the experience even better Joe took the time to pass by our table real quick to see how we were doing. I wish every restaurant had more managers like Joe! I highly recommend this cheese cake location to everyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=160
Margo J.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,53,9,4.0,10/14/2016,Went to the Cheesecake Factory at the Marina recently.  Haven't been there in years. Decided to try the Spaghetti.  The best spaghetti I've had in years! It was reminiscent of the Olde Spaghetti Factory in Hollywood. (my favorite spaghetti) Everything about it was great. The meatballs were humongous and so tasty and the sauce and spaghetti were great. My friend had the chicken and biscuits and loved it. The service was great. I tried the banana cream cheesecake and was by far the best cheesecake I've ever had. I will no longer be a stranger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=160

Linda Z.,"Venice, Venice, CA",18,335,510,4.0,2/11/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I really do. Whether it's the avocado eggrolls or the warm bread on the table, it's always a good time. Well. Usually.  Cheesecake Factory? You have broken my heart by removing the Thai Chicken Pasta from the menu. I know it's been more than a year since that item was removed from the menu, but it still breaks my heart every time I go in to one of the CF restaurants and can't have my absolutely favorite menu item ever. I mean, it was on the menu for years. YEARS. Why did it have to go? But I digress. My friends and I had a very nice brunch at this location recently. Great weather. Sat out on the patio. (You really should reconsider those chairs, though. We of the boo-tay clan have a difficult time getting comfortable in those wicker-thigh-busters you call chairs.) Sure, we had to adjust and readjust the umbrellas to avoid retinal damage and skin cancer, but it was worth it. Oh, so worth it. Our server (whose name I have forgotten .. sorry) was really nice and incredibly friendly. Just the right amount. Not overly-fakey-fakey, not aloof. The food was good. (except for the whole lack-of-thai-chicken-and-pasta fiasco) The cocktails were AMAZEBALLS. And the view? Perfection. Who doesn't want to enjoy fresh air, fresh food, boozy drinks, and a view of people doing yoga on paddle boards?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=160
Meg F.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/23/2017,My previous visits here were ok however we had a bad experience this time. We ordered mild guacamole which was tasteless. I was looking forward to my food but there was a hair stuck to my pasta!! very disgusting!!! They offered an exchange and I ordered a Togo salad instead. Our waiter Mario was ok but he didn't compensate us for their crappy food he just waived the hairy pasta. On top of it Restrooms were very dirty and very small. Had to wait in line for 15 minutes with a 4 year old. Never coming back here again!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=160

S.

Our daughter had the chicken sliders and felt nauseas after the first slider as well. Our 4th friend who had the cajun chicken had to send it  back after the first one she felt sick too. We had nachos to start with, which was all tortilla chips and barely any cheese. The best was the lemon drop and the bread. We were looking forward for a nice meal and to end it with some dessert. No dessert but vomiting and a lots of sour stomaches! Will I go back?

Jen H.,"Austin, TX",6,19,1,1.0,6/20/2016,After waiting an hour to be seated we ordered appetizers and drinks .  After about 40 min another server came out and said our server had gone on break and they wanted to know what we ordered. We reordered our appetizers and informed them that no one had taken our entree order.  Another 20 min and our 2 appetizers appeared . We started eating and realized one was wrong. We notified a server who immediately took away the wrong food instead of just letting us eat it while the correct one was made . An hour and a half later our entrees showed up.  Our second server said she notified management but no one came to apologize or offer a complimentary dessert or anything.

Beautiful atmosphere but the service was disappointing.. our appetizers came out at the same time our entrees.. sure it happens and I forgive them but the thing that keeps bothering me, even 2 days after, is that one food runner's comment that I'll never forget. ( As the appetizers and entrees come out and he's holding them ) & we said something like this is disappointing because our entrees are pretty big so we'd like to take some time to digest our appetizers before we grub on the entrees.

Loree K.,"Los Angeles, CA",266,129,276,1.0,7/17/2017,"Never. Ever. Ever Again. As a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory as a no-brainer go to (virtually anywhere) I feel extremely disappointed in my experience over the past weekend at this particular location. First and foremost, I am very aware of the long wait times at all cheesecakes and this review has nothing to do with the initial wait time. As this location is a beachfront location we decided to sit in the beachfront portion which is partially separated from the main portion. After about 45 minutes of waiting, we were seated. I went to the women's bathroom and it was a one stall bathroom which was filthy. We notified the restaurant. After being seated our waiter came to take the order. I had to repeat myself several times because he didn't want to write anything down on paper. Also, he acted very odd when we asked for simple requests. Our first request was a bread basket. It took us 55 minutes and asking two waiters maybe 7 times to get the bread basket. Second, I ordered a glass of wine. My wine came in a dirty glass. Since our waiter was long gone my mother decided to take my glass back to the bar to get it changed. After swapping the cup, the bartender told her to tell the waiter and that they should bring another glass on the house. We put in our order and after the 55 minutes when we got our bread we got a notification from the waiter that one of the items we ordered is sold out (which was just grilled artichokes btw). Ok great, tell us after an hour. I opened my napkin and silverware to find that my fork had a very disgusting unidentified something on it. I called another waiter and complained since ours was nowhere to be found. He then made a face himself and took the fork and promised me plastic silverware for me and my family (which never came). The food came all wrong, my aunts margarita had pickled jalapeños on it, and everything tasted not as good as it usually tastes. The waiter brought me another glass of wine after my father had to explain to him that it was dirty and explained to him that the bartender said that it should be replaced. Literally no common courtesy to replace it without an explanation. The waiter was the most odd waiter I have ever had. None of the waiters were communicating with each other either. When we asked for anything it took so long to get it that we just wanted to get out of there. They never cleaned the table they barely wanted to bring us anything we asked for. I felt as if the waiter thought it was a chore. At the end, we got our check and the waiter had TRIPLE charged my wine, which was dirty in the first place, after he brought me a second one. Anyway, we complained to the manager about the check and I started to vent about how its just been an extremely terrible experience. He apologized and told me I should have told him earlier. To end this review, I would like to say that due to the lack of cleanliness that I witnessed in those few hours I would never recommend that anyone I know go here until they fix these issues. As far as customer service goes, the staff definitely needs some help with that. Never at any other cheesecake factory (and I have been to a lot) have I experienced anything like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=160
Glenn A.,"Venice, CA",112,54,11,4.0,9/4/2016,Cheesecake Factory at Marina Del Rey is one of our go to spots. It's at Mother's beach so if you have a little one you can expend energy at the playground there. Food is always going to be good at Cheesecake.

Not the best I've had for a cheesecake, kind of disappointed to be honest, but we really only came here for the view. Great at anytime, but keep in mind the wait you may need to endure to enjoy it.  Parking is valet only. 3.50 until lunch and $5 after I think is what it was.

We told her we were celebrating the girls birthday when she greeted us.   I asked if we could order cheesecake with dinner so we did not have to wait for it.  She did not know how to do this without it coming right away :-/  We waited and waited after finishing dinner to order.  My niece had pulled her aside to remind her it was the little girls birthday.  Yep - she forgot.  Cheesecake finally came and WE sang to her without any help from the staff.   All around us people were being sung to with 4-6 servers joining in.  It was really sad.  The child was really sad!  Jen came when we were half way thru our cheesecake with a little cup of whipped cream, a teaspoon of ice cream and chocolate sauce wiped in the cup (that tasted horribly burnt) and ONE other person to sing to my niece.  Too little and too late.  We will find other places to go for our celebrations due to this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=200
Nina S.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,181,306,5.0,7/26/2015,Best Cheesecake Factory location!! I highly recommend getting their an hour earlier as it's always packed but super worth it. You get the bay view and once it gets dark outside the lights turn on in the patio. Took my mother here for her bday and got shrimp scampi and steak for her with the peach vodka drink. I got the lettuce chicken wrap and dynamite shrimp. The avocado egg rolls  are the best. Always get the bread in the beginning with their ranch dressing.

Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717,3.0,3/24/2015,"I generally think food at Cheesecake Factory is good (well depending on what you order), although I have had some items that were pretty disappointing. But anyways, I came to this Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday for lunch with my husband.  Not being familiar with Marina Del Rey or this location, we were surprised to see that we had to pay for parking (bummer to that and wished this restaurant would provide free parking since we are spending money at this business). But anyways, after we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess and seated at a table (with a nice outside view of the water). After looking over the menu, we got: Shrimp with Angel Hair- The portion of this entree was rather large and plenty for 2 people to share. The noodles were cooked a little to long, as they were a little bit on the soft (almost mushy) side. The shrimp itself tasted good but wished there were more of it. The creamy sauce itself was good, but oily (typical of restaurant fare).  Renee's Special- this lunch special comes with you choice of half a sandwich of either chicken almond salad or turkey. I opted for turkey and asked for it to be served on mustard instead of mayonnaise. This lunch special also comes with a cup of soup and a side of salad, which is quite a bit of food. The soup I had was tomato bisque and it was really nice and creamy and also served warm. But because the salad was served on the same plate as the soup and sandwich, a good part of it was already wilted by the time it got to my table. The turkey sandwich itself was pretty standard.  Service was just average. Our water glasses were refilled only once during our visit. We were checked on twice during our visit.  Overall, there isn't really anything special or unique about this visit, compared to our dining experiences at other Cheesecake Factory locations. Really the only reason you would want to come to Cheesecake Factory is for the cheesecake and their other desserts on the menu are pretty good as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=200

Alexis G.,"Lawndale, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/16/2017,"Before I give this review I want it to be known that I am a server part time and my family has ran a very successful restaurant business for over 50 years. I tend to be very understanding to restaurant service as I do have a well understanding with the dynamics of it. However, this location in Marina Del Rey has the absolute WORST service I've experienced. The last visit I had here was on January 22nd, 2017 for a birthday brunch with my four friends. The one pro was that we were sat immediately. Our drinks took about 30 minutes to get to us and I received the wrong drink twice. Maybe there was a tad of miscommunication as we had about 4 different servers helping us out with no introduction to the next. We didn't mind at first, but by the second to third server, with the food still not out, it was frustrating. When the food finally touched our table, again, my order was wrong and when I mentioned it to the server THEN that was helping us out (not the one who took the order) he snapped at me. Like I mentioned, I do not like to make a fuss, but this was ridiculous. I know what's appropriate when it comes to customer service. The last server to help us ( didn't catch her name) was negligent to us but not the rest of her tables. I brought up to the manager about the service and he was dismissive.

Brooklyn K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",87,34,28,4.0,8/30/2015,"Who doesn't love Cheesecake Factory? What I liked about this one in particular was the location though.  Be prepared to valet when you arrive as there's no self-parking. However, it's priced reasonably at only $4.50.  Went with a few girlfriends on a Saturday night and surprisingly got seated right away in the bar section. Our table was overlooking the water. Downfall was we came at night so we couldn't thoroughly enjoy the view. No biggie though, just gives us an excuse to come back for brunch!  If you eat seafood I recommend the miso salmon. It was probably one of the best cooked salmon dishes I've ever tasted. Very juicy and not overcooked.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the icky restrooms!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=220
Beydi H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,2,1.0,6/28/2017,"Negative stars for sure! This service was the WORST i've ever experienced at any restaurant. It all started from the beginning, my party and I arrived at 7:40 p.m for my sister-in-laws pre-birthday celebration. They advices us it will be an hour wait, so we waited, and waited and waited. It was 9:15 p.m and we were still outside waiting, we eventually got tired of waiting so we went in and asked what was taking so long and the waiter apologize and took us in. Made it seemed like they had available tables already without even calling us. Anyways, our waiter sat us down (pretty nice lady btw) took our drinks order. Then moved forward into taking our orders at around 9:30 p.m. We got appetizers and ordered our food as well so it wouldn't take much time. And from then, everything went down the drain. We literally got our food 1 hour after!!!!! UNBELIEVABLE! & to top it off my sister-in-law & cousin ordered the Filet Mignon (medium well) and when they got their food it was the nastiest steak i've ever seen in my life. Super dry and with no taste. WAY over cooked. We asked for them to re do it, and they said it will only take about 7 to 9 minutes, we didn't receive those plates until 20 minutes after!

Priscilla J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,2,,1.0,12/18/2016,"Allow me to start by saying that this is my first horrible experience at cheesecake factory. Normally, service there is great and the food and customer service is above average....but when I tell you yesterday was TERRIBLE it was absoulutely UNBEARABLE. My husband and I arrived to the bar ( where we always sit in order to get FASTER service with food and drinks) for cocktails and food. After waiting for about 40 minutes for bread, one entree and crab bites the bartender informed me that the runner forgot to bring our food....EVEN THE BREAD..... in the mean time... table after table and every other bar patron recieved our food. So after a couple cocktails and no food later I told the bartender that we could just leave if we are not going to be served any food. So he was very friendly about it and got the manager. The manager Amanda came out and assured us that the food would be there right away and was not !! It took another 20 minutes... and the order was wrong !!!! ugggh fast forward..... when she brought out the food again I asked her if it was safe for me to order anything else or would it take another hour.....she reassured me it would come out right away. IT DID NOT ......after another 40 minutes or so I saw Amanda casually pass by the bar and I stopped in asked her ....where are the chicken sliders? To her suprise she asked ...they didnt bring them yet? I told her no...then she went in the back and in about 10 minutes later she brought them out. LMAO.... when I tell you they ruined our entire experience...it would be an under statement. So then, in the end they took the 7 dollar chicken sliders and 7 dollar crab bites off and we paid 20 bucks for our pasta and 61 bucks for our drinks. I also tipped both off the bartenders 5 dollars a piece because they made pretty good drinks. Oh then she had the nerve to ask my husband and I if we were going to pay the bill...

The hostess was unorganized and unpresentable; I expect a friendly-welcoming greeting when I approach a host stand, not a frowned face.  Our server Sebastian was flat out terrible! He was rude, patronizing, and unfriendly. He took 15 minutes just to bring out our drinks and 45 minutes to bring our appetizer (burnt nachos btw) and barely came to check on us. He seemed not too happy and had a frown the entire time, and not to mention, his response after my girlfriend complained about the burnt nachos came off as snooty, very unacceptable. Out of the many Cheescake Factories I have dined in, I will say that I have never had a bad experience up until now. This location needs major improvement starting with free parking and hiring new competent-friendly servers.  Cheesecake Factory has left me jaded, seriously; the food and service were such a disappointment.

The views from inside and outside the restaurant are spectacular, being right off the marina. However, we weren't pleased that parking was only valet and we were basically yanked out of our car by pushy valet staff. In my personal opinion, I believe valet parking should be more of a choice and not a MUST. But, I'll just let that go. We arrived at 5pm and were seated at about 5:20pm - so overall, not too long of a wait, especially for a Sunday night. Our waitress was extremely friendly but forgot about us when a party of twenty was seated next to us. Our waitress took our drink orders and didn't return until we needed boxes and a check. (Probably would've given five stars, if the service was a little better.) But aside from the service, the food was outstanding. Everyone loved their dishes - myself especially.

I ordered the bbq chicken salad which they brought out and it was missing the onion rings on top my favorite part. They waiter said i'm going to bring your inion rings soon. So after 15 min of no onion rings i go to the bathroom on my way back I saw the waiter grab some onion rings with his bare hands from a bigger plate of rings and take it to our table... Is that even sanitary? I think not. If this wasn't bad enough my mom ordered the luau salad. The waitress came and said um sorry we dont have the wontons that go in this salad so we said its fine since all the rest of the food was out.. Later the manager came and said that he was making them fry fresh wontons and the salad wouldn't be charged. Overall it was a horrible experience.

It took a few minutes and a someone came to assist us. They gave us the option of indoor or outdoor. I'm glad we chose outdoor because it was very beautiful outside. That's where the good stops. So as we were being seated my husband informed her that it was my birthday. She told us where to sit, and gave us our menus. Another lady comes by and asked us what we will be having. We weren't ready yet so she gave us a few minutes which felt like maybe 60 seconds. She seemed very impatient. So after her second time around we gave her our drink and appetizer order. She carded me and that's when I got my happy birthday. After that we didn't see her for about ten minutes or more. She didn't bring our drinks or our appetizers. Another man came and brought us our drinks and we still waited for our appetizers. She then reappeared when a group of guys were seated next to us. They told her that it was one of the guys birthday and she told him happy birthday they proceeded to order and she left and still didn't come back to check on us. After some more time went by she came back and asked for the rest of our order which at this time we've spent most of our time just waiting for her to resurface so she can take the rest of our order. We order two entrees and a dessert. She then disappeared again, came back and took more of the groups order. We finally received our appetizers from someone else. At this point I'm becoming a little agitated because after all I've never been here and it's my birthday and I expected a better experience. I was still willing to sit it out but the last straw for me was that a few servers came to that group singing happy birthday and gave them a cake with a candle. A group that came after us. Not only that then all of their food started coming out. So then she tells them that she was going on break and if they needed more help that the back up server can assist them. She comes over to us and she says I'm going on a mandatory break during that time no one will be taking my place I will be back after my break. Goes to the next table and repeats what she said to the first table. I was in such shock so when the replacement server came out with the rest of our food I asked for a manager. He came over immediately and I explained to him that I don't understand how that group got their birthday song and cake before I did. And he said he knows it my birthday it comes after the food which clearly it doesn't because that group got theirs before their food started pouring out. I told him that I didn't want anything more than what we have eaten and drank and that I wanted the check. He tried his hardest to keep us there. He kept insisting that we stay and that he would serve us and they already made our food which at that point I don't care that the food was already made. I don't appreciate waiting on a server with an attitude for an hour on a Monday when they weren't even that busy. The type of service she gave us deserves negative stars. Management needs to retrain her or fire her because what people don't realize is that you are the face of your company so what u put out to your customers will ultimately determine how the visit goes. So even though this place had a great scenery and some awesome sliders the service was horrible and the management was very pushy about us staying even though I told him no well over six times. What I can credit him for is the fact that he gave me a complimentary cheesecake to go. So good job on that, but it doesn't change the fact that my birthday dinner was ruined. I most definitely won't be returning to this location hopefully other locations are a lot more customer focused.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=280

The location seems to get extremely crowded, but hey it's a popular chain on the Marina. 2. Take Out (0 - 1 stars): Up to one star based purely on the fact that the food was edible. I made the mistake of ordering take out this weekend and the list of complaints in quite expansive. to name a few - All of our meals seemed to be undercooked - Asked for extra pumpernickel bread - Got NO BREAD WHATSOEVER! - When called to confront about the bread was hung up on Take out was just lacking the TLC that I have grown to expect from such a well established chain.

The bad review was for the long wait we had to deal with when we were waiting for our table and our food. It was my sister-in-law's birthday so the whole family went out for dinner (Party of 11; 3 of them are kids). It was only a Wednesday night and yet we were told that it was a 1 hr wait for an outdoor patio table. Ok, 1 hr seemed long but doable so we waited. And waited... And waited. Then my husband said, ""Oh wait. That couple leaving...Didn't we wait when they waited?"" We then realized we waited for 2 friggin hrs! So we went inside just hungry and tired of waiting, and they claimed they still didn't have a table ready for us. Since we already invested so much time in waiting, we stayed but had to call the head manager. After we spoke to the manager all of a sudden a table was ready for us. But they were very apologetic to us and our waiter apologized to us profusely as well. The food also took awhile to arrive as well. We were a large party, however, the restaurant was emptying out since it was getting late. Aside from the long wait of waiting for out table and food, everything was great. Thankfully! The restaurant provided complimentary pie and cocktail for the birthday girl, cocktails were yummy (Mojito/Margarita), the food was great (shrimp pasta/mac n cheese burger), and our waiter was on point.

They need to make a Cheesecake Factory to-go. That might be impossible with the extensive menu, but... I just wanna have a slice of cheesecake delivered to me. Despite the chain's reputation for having high-caloric, fat-filled, carb-loaded dishes, they do have a good amount of healthy options. The Thai chicken lettuce wraps were huge (although there could be more chicken...) and the chopped veggie salad was just okay. And if you're going to a factory of cheesecake, it becomes a duty to have a slice. I tried the macadamia nut caramel cheesecake, something I wouldn't normally get, but it was really good! The crust is sticky sweet, and the crunchy macadamia nuts balance out that thick, oozy caramel. They split the cheesecake in half for us... but, I think I prefer sharing the slice on one plate. That way, I can either eat it all.. or just a bite.. depending if I like it or not. I mean, because its more romantic to have it one plate obviously.

Then waited for the food to arrive, and waited, and waited! Eventually my fathers meal arrived at the same time as my daughter's. Approximately 10 minutes later my Mothers food arrived, then another 8-10 minutes later my wife's arrived, and 3-5 minutes after that my son's arrived, no sign of mine, or any apology or excuse.

Again, I waited, and waited eventually, about 10 minutes the fries and onion rings appeared but of course by now the steak was cold, do I asked the waiter to reheat it and to bring the steak knife that I asked for 3 times previously, only to be told...... ""Sorry, we don't have any clean steak knives, they have all been used and we are waiting for them to be washed up!!!"" My steak came back 3-5 minutes later nice and hot but of course by now the fries and onion rings were cold. I simply eat the steak, which rated good and left the fries. My Father was so upset, he called the manager over and explained that in 60 years of working in the catering industry he had never experienced such bad service and insisted the manager remove the steak from the bill, the manager did so and tried defending the bad service by saying it's not usually this bad, ""we're just so busy, look around, they don't seem unhappy!""

Objectively, this place is great other than that it is always busy, they don't take reservations and you have to valet park ( which kind of seems like a nightmare but I always walk, so to be fair I can't talk smack).

Erica W.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,"On vacation from Houston, TX and decided to hit up Cheesecake Factory. My son, wanted steak so we ordered the Hibachi Steak. Waitress was great, drinks and appetizers came out in a reasonable amount of time.  My daughter and I both had the Cajun Pasta, good, but a little more oil pooled at the bottom for our taste but I scooped it out.  We're on vacay so the patience meter is extended a little more than the norm. My son, who was the hungriest of us all had to wait on his dinner for about 10 minutes longer. His order was supposed to be everything minus mushrooms and  sub fries for mashed potatoes. What came out was hibachi jerky, VERY dry with sauce on the side laid on top of sprouts and mushrooms, no asparagus and the requested fries never came. Didn't see the waitress for about 7 minutes after the food came so I could let her know we were missing 60% of the order and that it wasn't prepared as requested. She finally brought the fries 15 minutes after the plate was given and my son had started eating on the beef jerky because he was HUNGRY after a full day at the beach.  She said she would  get the manager to come over when I asked for the vegetable that never came (did I mention I never requested a manager). When he finally showed up (to a table that was packing and leaving and I had to wave him over to us) his response was (insert sarcastic laughter) "" whoa looks like he ate it, couldn't have been that dry""! I hadn't even explained yet what happened. I started to tell him that we had been waiting so long he started to eat the ancient meat and the fries had just arrived but he interrupted me and asked my son what his favorite cake was. In true kid fashion he said chocolate so the manager was like ""ok I'll send chocolate cake"" AND WALKED AWAY! No apologies, and didn't even take into consideration that this kid is still hungry! WTF! I never asked for a refund and he didn't even offer to remake it! All I wanted was for my son to actually eat dinner! So, after paying the bill, I went to Subway to feed him because he was still hungry. Oh yeah, the manager never gave me his name otherwise I would use it here. I'll just call him the tall fair skin Jerk, which is fitting because my son was served $18 beef jerky with no sides. Thanks Marina Del Rey Cheesecake Factory for the impeccable service and consideration. Subway did the job and we actually got what we wanted for way cheaper.

However, something about this location tries to make this Cheesecake Factory seem like you're dining at the freaking Ivy. It's so full of pretension, I wouldn't be surprised if the valet attendants judge you by the kind of vehicle you drive.  Oh, Valet! Why in the world is it necessary to valet your car for an establishment that contains an open and large lot? I learned how to park a very long time ago and I certainly don't mind taking the few extra minutes to make it happen vs paying someone else to do it. Having the option is one thing, but forcing everyone to valet is quite another. I guess it all boils down to the view, which, don't get me wrong, is pretty damn awesome if you're able to sit some place where you can actually appreciate it. And even then, you'll be so starved from waiting over an hour to be seated that your eyes will probably be fixated on the delicious bread basket.  Service here is fine. Food is fine. The menu is VAST and will probably take you about 20 minutes to get through. I like variety and options, though, so I'm not complaining too much. To me, Cheesecake Factories are best in malls. You almost always have an insane wait, so having it located in a mall makes killing time before the meal a breeze. While the view here is amazing, it is probably the only amazing thing you'll be experiencing during your visit. That and the amazing amount of calories you just consumed in one slice of that thawed out cheesecake. Don't get me wrong, Cheesecake Factory serves its purpose, but this location in particular, tries entirely too hard.  Next.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=340
Anna G.,"Chatsworth, CA",388,464,253,3.0,3/28/2015,"So I decided to pull a Ferris Bueller last Tuesday and ditched work to spend the day with my best friends from out of town. One of our stops was Cheesecake Factory as we decided to pregame before dinner. I stuck to our plan and ordered light to save room for our real dinner but they decided to go on the heavier route reassuring me that they would still have room for dinner. Just a lil tidbit on our friendship..it revolves around food. Since our UCLA days we've been major foodies and made it our mission to eat. We plan our days around food and manage to out-eat everyone around us...including our 200+ pound boyfriends.  We stopped by a little after 5 which sucked since we missed their lunch menu but I was planning on ordering off their small plates menu so I didn't care too much. We were able to get seated right away and found a great spot outside, I can't really say much about their food because it's a chain restaurant and every Cheesecake has the same menu. This particular location has a great view which is just an added bonus to their already affordable prices and generous portions. I have recently been hooked on their Asian lettuce tacos and that did it for me as far as pre-dinner went. We ordered the avocado rolls for appetizers and the food tasted right, as I would expect it to.  I was not thrilled about having to valet and pay $5/$6 to have someone park my car a few feet away from the restaurant but it makes sense to charge since it is a beach. If the parking was free then everyone would park there. I don't really have complaints about my experience but the one thing that I can mention is that my friend and I were almost done with our food before my other friend received hers. I had the tacos, Jeannette had pasta, and Fatima's fried chicken(off the menu apparently) didn't make it to the table till I was pretty much done with my meal. Hey..at least I was able to get a piece of her chicken lol. If you're in the area and you feel like eating, grab yourself a Peach Belini and enjoy the views here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=340

Charles M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,162,15,3.0,4/24/2016,"Back in the day this was the place to go.  Being from LA, I've been to this Cheesecake Factory to celebrate someone's birthday quite a few times.  So recently I decided to take someone here for their b-day. 1.  First of all they don't take reservations.  I think management does this on purpose so if they are fully booked, people might go elsewhere... instead patrons' only option is to get there and put there name down and depending on how busy it is, just wait.  Read the other reviews.  This stinks for big groups.  Granted the staff working there are pretty good. (If you really want to eat at a Cheesecake Factory, the Santa Monica one said they did take reservations during weekdays at their non-peak hours.) 2.  Eating outside.  If it's near dinner time it might seem like a good idea to eat outside.  Especially when we were offered seating immediately on their patio.  I sat with the sun in my face and tried to move the umbrellas over to get some shade but that didn't help much.   Then when the sun set it got windy and cold.  We did ask them to turn on the heat lamp so that helped.   3.  The view here is pretty nice.  This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory. 4.  Prices on their menu.  I noticed on their menu, for some reason they don't list prices on most of their drinks (other than wine) and their cheesecake.  We ordered the Salted Caramel cheesecake and it was 7.95. 5.  The food here has never been that amazing or memorable but it's definitely above average.  The portion sizes are decent and it seems like everyone is taking leftovers home. On my most recent  visit we did order a salad, the Spicy Cashew Chicken and their steak and salmon combo.  The salad was good, the steak and salmon were fine as well but the Spicy Cashew Chicken has issues. I think they rushed the order and they didn't cook off the alcohol from the sauce. (I know when I follow a recipe for teriyaki sauce they use either a sake or mirin but when I tried the Spicy Cashew Chicken the alcohol flavor was way too much.) I ended up eating my friend's dish and most of the break. (The bread is pretty darn good... I'm pretty sure they're extra sugar in the warm wheat bread. 6.  Cheesecake.  If you don't thoroughly enjoy the meal (like we did) be sure to get some cheesecake.  We had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and that was pretty amazing. That pretty much saved the night and we left happy.   So if you decide to visit a Cheesecake Factory, make sure you leave room for dessert. 7.  Valet Parking.  I think the sign said Mon-Thu for Lunch - $3.50, and any other time is $5. I went in late April 2016 so it might change. If you do decide to go to the Cheesecake at Marina Del Ray, keep in mind the food isn't the best, you'll likely wait, but the desserts and the view alone is worth a visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=340

Service was outstanding, people were really busing their  A$$. We had been seated next to the kitchen though, pretty noisy with dishes banging but what are you going to do? The worst part about the place, aside from the crowd and wait is the restaurant set up. You have to walk through the kitchen/serving area to get to the seats. Then if you have to goto the restroom you travel back through that area. All in all the experience was ok, the food was decent but well over priced. The service was amazing.

Joan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",244,89,20,1.0,1/10/2015,"I was here on Monday for my 1 year anniversary and it surely did not meet my expectations.  I've gone to several cheesecake factories because the food is standard and of course, I love the cheesecake but this specific location needs lots of improvement when it comes to service.   Typically, I expect to wait 30 or more minutes to be seated.  It is usually a given and in this case, it was true.  However, usually after you are seated, service tends to shine.  This time around, once we were seated, it took over ten minutes to see a server.   By the time our server Tim arrived, I ended up ordering drinks and food at once.  We even had to request eating utensils because the table was not set properly.  Tim seemed really annoyed when I placed our order for food, drinks, utensils and bread at the same time.  After some time passed, we finally got some bread delivered but no utensils or drinks.  By the time I got utensils, the bread was cold.  I would have requested a new batch of bread if I knew i would not have to wait long.  I eventually got my utensils and drink just before my food was served.   When my food finally arrived, the server never bothered to return and ask us how our food tasted.  By the time someone came over, it was the manager who had noticed I barely touched my food.  I was already annoyed by the lack of service that I lost my appetite.  This was probably the first time I even chose to leave without cheesecake.  I just wanted to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=340

I tried the southern fried catfish with mashed potatoes, corn, and green beans.  The catfish was very dark in color, but inside it was cooked just right, not dry.  The portions of the sides seemed a bit modest.  I remember when Cheesecake Factory portions were known to be rather huge...Not anymore.  The catfish was adequate with three pieces, but the sides did seem skimpy.

Vanessa B.,"Sawtelle, Los Angeles, CA",125,138,55,3.0,1/8/2015,"In general, I'm pretty indifferent to the Cheesecake Factory chain and rarely eat here since 1) the portions are entirely way too big for one single person (my 1 entree here served as two dinners and one lunch) and 2) it's pretty pricey for a meal.   My roommates and I came here the other night because one of them received a gift card to the Cheesecake Factory and treated us out to dinner.   For drinks: we ordered Moscow Mules - I had the Pineapple one and they had a regular Moscow Mule.  If you like sweet drinks, then I would definitely recommend the Pineapple Moscow Mule.  The drinks were strong enough without it being too ""alcoholic"" tasting because of the sweetness of the pineapple.   For appetizers: we ordered the Pretzel Chicken which were delicious! They were pretzel-breaded chicken on skewers and came with two different dipping sauces - unsure what exactly what kind they were but both tasted like different kinds of honey mustard and had good flavors For dinner: I had the Pasta Da Vinci - penne pasta with chicken, mushroom and onion in a Madeira Sauce. I thought the pasta was a little too oily for my taste and the proportions were not well balanced - there was very little chicken, mushroom and onion compared to the overwhelming amount of penne pasta.  In addition, my pasta was not consistent - in the sea of penne pasta, i found 1 spaghetti noodle, 1 macaroni elbow and 1 farfalle pasta.  Don't get me wrong, it didnt bother me at all and I ate them gladly but as a critical perspective of the restaurant, I think that seeing how this is a farily nice chain restaurant, there are certain standards that should be met and upheld.  This just seems like there is no quality control in the kitchen.  For dessert: I had the Smore's cheesecake, which I took to go since I was already so full - tried some the next day and it was excellent! I love all kinds of cheesecake though and especially chocolate so my opinion may be biased.   Service: I thought it was passable - our waitress did the bare minimum - got our orders correct, but she didn't ask in the middle of our entree how we were doing or if the food was ok.   Parking: it's Valet only and at night it costs $4.50 which I think is kind of a rip off  but then again it's Marina Del Rey so it was expected.  However, the valet attendant was driving with not the most extreme care with my car - when he was driving to pull up, he ran into a orange cone and it dragged in the front of my car for about a few feet before he realized what was wrong.  Even though there was no damage to the car, I was pretty pissed because I'm paying for a service that I don't need since I'm capable of parking my own car and also entrusting my car in the hands of someone else, which they failed to do so with care.   Probably won't come back here again because there's other good restaurants worth while eating at but the view outside was nice since it looked out of the Marina.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=360

I learn now there is a self park lot nearby. The hostess is tucked in past the bar and dessert counter which can be confusing for a first time diner in a congested lobby. Beautiful location for patio dining overlooking the marina. Staff provided excellent, friendly service. Chicken Madiera with potatoes is listed as a favorite, and it was good.

TIP: If you visit, the parking is ONLY valet.  It is $5- cash per car.  (it seems well organized) The cheesecakes and cakes looked awesome as usual, but I was too full to try one :( Pumpkin and Pumpkin Pecan are both there now!  Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=360

I've lived in Marina del Rey for 2 years now and I've never actually been to this CF location despite the fact I do enjoy me the large CF menu options and cheesecakey goodness. My friends who just moved to MDR thought we should try it out so I headed over. Quick little drive from my place and I thought to myself ""How awesome! So close - I can get my CF fix anytime I want...wait what's this. Oh valet...I have to pay? How much? Ok can I self-park? I can...but I still have to pay...wth.""  Immediate loss of 1 star. You walk in and it looks rather small at first but after walking through a little maze of tables you get to a larger back area. There is a nice outdoor seating area with cabanas but it was far too cold and dark to enjoy that.  Our waitress was adorable and sweet - we couldn't have asked for a more smiley, attentive waitress. Prompt taking of drinks and bread delivery. But then there was the wait for food. I didn't mind it as I was enjoying good conversation but seriously...my patience was being tried.  Minus another star.  Eventually the food came. It was standard good CF food. Nothing excitingly crazy but what I wanted. We paid the bill, paid the valet (honestly, it irks me to no end that my meal was $10.95 and valet cost almost 50% of that) and I decided if I ever have any CF craving again I'll either do curbside or do my waistline and frugal self a favor and not go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=620

First I called in about 30 minutes ahead to make sure that my takeout would be ready for pick up. Pulled into the lot and parked at an empty stall. Immediately an attendant told me that I could not park there and I had to either valet or park in another lot farther down. I don't think so! There is no way I am parking that far to just to walk in and pick up my takeout! When I explained to him I was picking up, he said, ""You have 10 minutes."" When I arrived at the pick up counter, my order was not ready. I waited for 20 minutes while he tries to locate my receipt. He assisted other customers as he waited for his manager to assist. Mind you, he did not bother to tell me this. He just started assisting other customers. When is manager arrived, his manager said ""So what do you want me to do about it?"" The guy at the register continued to assist other customers in line. He just ignored me and did not apologize for the wait or anything. He just looked frustrated. Even the customers in line noticed me waiting on the side and asked the if I had been helped. The employee replied, ""Yes, yes I am helping her."" Really?

Rebecca P.,"Seattle, WA",241,761,95,3.0,10/23/2012,"After reading all the reviews for this place and factoring in my general feel for TCF based on past experiences and my bias against chains in general, I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, valet parking sucks, but I found parking for a weekday lunch just two blocks away and sauntered over. Sitting out on the patio overlooking a somewhat surreal vision of a beach... a few blocks from the Pacific, we ordered from a patient, upbeat server. Soon, she brought our meals--my friend's Pasta Da Vinci (basically a version of Marsala, 2.5-3 stars) and my Santa Fe Chicken Salad (4 stars, even if not the traditional flavor I have come to expect from places like Bread and Porridge in Santa Monica). We followed up with what the Factory does best--cheesecake. Now, my piece seemed significantly smaller than my friends, but it was still a little bit of heaven in its seasonal pumpkiny goodness. But, OMG, I had a bite of her chocolate one--I think the Godiva--and it was AMAZING. I'd go back just for that... sitting on the surreal beach.  Bottom line: Sometimes chains don't suck as much as you think. Try the salad. Get the chocolate cheesecake.

Sochil F.,"Lennox, CA",1,14,11,2.0,7/26/2015,I should of read the reviews before coming to this location. I've been to other Cheesecake Factory's and never had such a bad experience as today. First off just like others mentioned this place was jam packed it was Saturday and we found out later there was an event nearby. We were surprised when they said there wouldn't be a wait but we soon realized it was because they were giving us a small table off the side with heavy traffic. The seats were so close together felt like we were part of a big party rather than dinner for two. Our server was slow taking our order our drinks took long he couldn't get my husband a second beer before he finished the rest of his food. He said he'd get a manager to find out what was happening at bar we never heard back. We didn't even order dessert at our table because we knew it would take too long we figured we'd order and pay for it at the dessert station before we left which was another chaos people standing around everywhere waiters squeezing through people bumping you no space to stand without having to move for someone else to get by. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the food was good and the cheesecake was delicious but next time I know to stay away from this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=620
Polina R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,3,5.0,9/12/2013,Some of the best service I have received at Cheesecake was at this location.

Andrea C.,"Santa Monica, CA",76,8,,1.0,1/3/2015,"Do not come here if you have a big party since they don't take reservations and the wait is super long. We had a party of 8 people and waited over 75 minutes for a table. The waiter took a long time to get us bread and throughout the night, we could not get anyone to serve us drinks for quite a while. We were starving but the appetizers came after the entrees did. The pastas we were ordered were pretty bland. We came to celebrate 2 birthdays. They usually offer complimentary ice-cream sundaes to you if you have a birthday, but if you want the free sundae, DO NOT buy a cheesecake for dessert. We bought 4 cheesecakes and were not offered the sundaes because we bought the cheesecakes. However, their policy is, if you don't buy a cheesecake, then they will give you the free sundae. Very odd logic to me, since, if we had known this ahead of time, we would not have bought the cheesecakes. Customers should be rewarded for buying their cheesecakes, not for NOT buying them. When the cheesecakes arrived, we also didn't have any knives for a long time and had to use our forks to cut them. The cheesecakes were not particularly good and just tasted greasy.

I immediately called the manager and explained to him what happened, he said he could not believe it as that dish was one of their signature dishes. I offered to send him a picture, but he said it was not necessary. I received a $20.00 gift card to cover the cost of the dish and an apology letter a few days after, but I am sad to say That I will only use it for cheesecake, i don't think I could eat their food again.

Wait time to get a spot can vary up to 2 hours! The valet staff can be a little reckless when driving/parking cars.  Restrooms: Are disgusting! There are puddles on the floor or at the very least a quarter inch of water on the floor, along with some toilet paper and other miscellaneous things.  Food: The portions are really big so one plate will feed 2-4 people. I don't know if I would try anything off the menu, its just not the tastiest food.

I visit about once every 1-2 weeks and usually get my food ""to-go"". I get take out from various restaurants most every night of the week, so I am somewhat of an authority on restaurant take-out. The Cheesecake Factory MDR hands-down runs the best take-out operation I have seen anywhere. No matter how busy the restaurant is, and no matter what I order, they food is always ready on time. They can turn out almost anything in 15 minutes or less. So many restaurants completely drop the ball on take-out when they are busy, but not The Cheesecake Factory. The food is also well-packaged, and I have never had a problem with order accuracy. They also have four or five dedicated take-out parking spaces which makes it super-easy to get in and out.

Our server came to introduce himself and didn't even bother asking us if we wanted something to drink. He wasn't even the one who brought out our food. Nor did he ever come check to see if we needed anything else, no drink refills even had to ask for our bill..never asked us if we wanted cheesecake or dessert either. So we paid and ordered cheesecake to go and the guy that helped us there wasn't nice either.

Kisa F.,"Los Angeles, CA",232,8,2,1.0,8/13/2013,"I am giving this place one star solely due to the valet and I believe the restaurant should do something about them!  I went here last night on a date with my boyfriend and, as usual, we had to valet. I have no problem using a valet and I think it is quite convenient. The valet at the Cheesecake Factory in Manhattan Beach is much more pleasant BTW. After dinner, we both realized we did not have cash. The valet does not take credit cards... this is one of my problems. It is 2013 and accommodating for credit cards is not far-fetched at all. Also, if this is the case, the restaurant should at least have an ATM on hand. However, the valet does not take credit cards and there is no ATM on site. Here is where the valet worker started with his attitude. We simply asked what the option is when people have no cash and he starts yelling about there being an ATM across the street at a liquor store.  After a bit of back and forth trying to figure out where this store was (it was next door around the restaurant), my boyfriend started walking over to the store. I handed over my ticket and after a few seconds I found a $5 bill in my purse. So I figured he would bring the car before the boyfriend would make it to the store anyway and I could pay him and leave. I am waiting alone in the cold at night in a shirt with no sleeves. The man goes over to where the keys are kept and I figure he's getting the car. All this time passes by and still... no car. Even if I was waiting for him to return with cash, they could have brought the car over for me to sit in to the side as I have seen them do before. I ask one of the other attendants where my car is and he just says ""I don't know"" quickly and now takes another two sets of keys from a man that walked out of the restaurant. Their cars come. Mine is still not here. The boyfriend comes back from the store and asks where is the car? I still don't know either. I walk over to them and before I even say anything, the initial man yells ""I am getting it!"" This was so rude and disrespectful. In my attempt to keep my cool, I just shrug it off and say ""well your tip is gone."" My car was finally brought out and now I have to wait behind these other two cars with people who also don't have cash. So I am there for a longer period of time as my car is blocked on both sides. We had such an enjoyable experience in the restaurant with a WONDERFUL waiter and great food. It's unfortunate that the valet is quite the opposite.

Then I sit down, the server was SO rude from the beginning. (And I NEVER complain about service). She asked me if she could get anything for me and I asked for sauce for my dry chicken. She half rolled her eyes at me and told me it would take five minutes to make. I said, ""I don't mind"" and she said ""well it's going to take a while so you'll have to wait,"" In a rude manner. WHATTT???? Even my friend saw the situation and thought it was rude. We didn't say anything. 10 minutes pass and no sauce. I ask her again. She says ""she's busy and she will get to it."" No sauce, another 10 minutes, I ask again and she says it's coming out. I KID YOU NOT. My friend was there she saw the whole thing as well. Okay, the manager comes over and asks our table if we need anything. I ask for the sauce, told him I never got it after asking multiple times. He says he will personally get it. 10 minutes pass. No sauce. By this point I'm laughing, so shocked the manager can't even care. I ask a random sweet server for the manager and about my sauce. She goes to THE MANAGER and asks for sauce, he tells her to go back to me and say he forgot and he's getting the sauce. He didn't even come over and apologize, by this time I gave up and was leaving. I didn't even get to eat my food because it was dry and no sauce. As I'm walking away the random server I pulled aside earlier who was nice, came as I was walking away with the sauce.  If it was just my first time at Cheesecake Factory, whatever, but this is my THIRD TIME and EVERY time I've had horrible service.

I have the pear and endive chicken salad and it tasted the same as the regular one. I asked the difference and the waiter kindly replied that the dressing was a new recipe. My friend had the Asian chicken salad and the dressing was also a new recipe, but where most of the calories left were in the Wonton crispies.

Judy L.,"San Diego, CA",10,126,,1.0,7/26/2012,"I hate this Cheesecake Factory. Hate it. And usually, it takes very little to satisfy me, so this location just sucks. I'm not deluding myself, this is a CHEESECAKE factory. Where there be a Westfield Mall, there shall be one! ... So I'm not expecting 5 star dining or anything, just my usual standard fare. The first thing --- Valet parking ONLY. Wtf? What if I want to park the car myself? It also takes longer to get my car through valet than just walking out the door onto the lot. The fact that you have to pay $4.50 for the service as well is just a slap in the face. Sure, maybe for many in this area, $4.50 is chump change but I just hate that is was mandatory! It was $4.50 for dinner, from what I read, lunch valet is cheaper. We went on a Sunday evening. We were driving back from San Pedro and we were starving! Our options were the Redondo Beach location or this one, else wait for the long drive back to Thousand Oaks and eat there (we couldn't wait). We asked for a table for two inside, were told 30mins, took a pager but found a table at the bar and as we were sitting, our pager buzzed. Huh? Why tell us 30mins? It didn't matter either way because we were fine with the bar table but we had sat and then had to get up and wait 5mins to be seated again. Our server and service were minimal. We weren't dressed to impress, that's for sure, since we were on Catalina Island for most part of the day. I wonder if that was why? We got what we needed I guess ... just took a little bit of a wait. I ALWAYS order a side of sweet potato fries for an appetizer (sometimes as my meal, but shhhh). I always order it right away, because a kid at heart is an impatient one. We also ordered the factory burrito to share, sans the chicken. We did ask for extra wheat bread and got that while we waited a long time for the fries. And when it finally came, it was half the portion size that we normally get at any of the cheesecake factories we normally attend. I was kind of dismayed, I waited all day for these! Oh well. But not only that, it was missing the usual spicy garlic aoili or whatever they call it. I've been there enough times to know that it's not a thing where only one restaurant serves it a certain way ... so we asked for it and the server (another) basically was like ""no, we have a garlic aoili but it does not go with that"" and we were like uhhh ... can we have it? Didn't taste exactly like it though so we were disappointed. I know that people probably don't order that side as often but he was basically saying it like ""uh no you're wrong"" and I don't like that :( especially when it's about my unhealthy obsession (in more ways than one) with the sweet potato fries. Our factory burrito was worse ... Usually it's huge! This one was tiny and it was lacking that sauce it normally comes with, in which it definitely needed as well! Inside there is just white rice and vegetables and so there's no liquid and without that sauce it's kind of difficult to eat. I wasn't too happy about that ... We'd had a long day and so it was just a disappointing meal! It was my birthday and so I did get a birthday Sundae but asked them not to sing when they came up to the table. I was not feeling it. But it was really sweet that one of the waiters was like ""but we're already here!"" but whispered behind his band ""happy birthday!"" quietly. So that was good.  Overall my experience sucked. Service could have been better. I just wanted yummy fries :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=740

R H.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,32,1,5.0,9/8/2013,"Okay ... so I've been going to Cheesecake Factory for many years now ... and quite frequently too ... once every 2 to 3 weeks ... so you can see I am a fan.  Never bothered to write a review in all these years.  So what prompted me to write this review, you might ask ... well, it was the blunder they made with my last dine-in order.  Blunder? ... and still 5 stars? well, yes ... I think they deserve it. My wife and I went for a dinner last week.  Everything from waiting to seating to order-taking to appetizer service was going well ... till our entrees arrived.  Chicken Bellagio  is originally served with prosciutto.  I don't eat pork so I specifically asked for NO prosciutto.  In fact, although I have Cheesecake Factory's gigantic menu pretty much all memorized, and although I know what menu items have pork and cooking alcohol in them, as a matter of habit, I always mention my waiter that I don't eat pork and can't have any alcohol, so if I order an item that contains either pork or alcohol, please caution me.  That night was no exception. When the dish was served, there was this big slice of prosciutto on top.  When I mentioned that I ordered it without prosciutto, the girl who brought out the food took it right back and told me that they will quickly prepare it again.  Seconds later our waiter was there apologizing and a minute later the manager was at our table side apologizing and offering chowder while I waited for the dish to be prepared again, not knowing that we had already ordered chowder earlier (and it was delicious). Now I can see all this when a customer is visibly upset or loud, but I was neither upset nor did I complain loudly.  I was, for some reason, simply in too good a mood to let anything this small ruin it. I have always enjoyed their food, which I must mention, is always plentiful, and I have always admired their excellent service ... and I look forward to being their customer for a long time. They didn't comp me for the dish.  They didn't comp the dessert either (a slice of tiramisu cheesecake) that my wife and I shared, which I find slightly surprising.  But they still get 5 stars from me for both food and service.

I ordered from the bar, and I should have known cuz dude had no idea what I was talkin about.

Obviously it was, because minutes later he came back and asked if I wanted dressing on 1 half and the other half dry???? WTF was he talking about? I just want dressing on the side. So, he comes back with my food.  1. The salad was tossed. 2. He brought me 2!!!! I had to walk out on that one. Cuz he blew my mind. It's not that difficult. A Cobb Salad with dressing on the side...easy. I ended up leaving and going to Cafe Del Rey where I always have a nice time. PS...I had a flash back of why I knew I needed to request that the salad need not be tossed. I ordered one before and it was horrid, ice berg lettuce, not mixed greens like the menu says, the chicken is damn near raw and un-seasoned.

Sean M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,11,,4.0,10/16/2011,"This is the most picturesque Cheesecake Factory I've been to. It sits right next to Mother's Beach (a few feet from the sand) and overlooks one of the fingers of the Marina. The outdoor seating is very nice, with a large terraced patio with umbrellas, and gas lamps for the evening. There is also a newly-remodeled and classy-looking patio at the lower level with fire pits and comfortable lounge furniture. Since this is a chain, the food is the same as that at other locations. I particularly like several of the appetizers, which can be full meals in and of themselves, such as the Avocado Eggrolls, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes and the Fried Mac 'n Cheese (although they are two days worth of calories and fat). The menu is of course the size of a catalog and there are plenty of options for just about everyone. Most dishes are enormous and in my opinion, flavorful and well-prepared. In terms of drinks, they have a good selection of bar favorites, and their flavored lemonades are also great. The real winner here is of course the cheesecake, every flavor I've tried has been incredibly delicious and worth the 7 or 8 dollars (still hurts to pay the bill sometimes). My favorite is the Godiva cheesecake, followed by the Tiramisu. My wife loves the Key Lime and the Original. Service is usually good, with the occasional exception. The wait times can be long during the peak hours (but you can take a stroll down the Marina).  Valet parking is not optional and they seem to increase the fee every year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=740

Teague V.,"Marina del Rey, CA",524,14,47,5.0,2/28/2010,"My girlfriend works at the Cheesecake Factory, which puts me in a position that I feel I can help explain a lot of the weird or annoying things that can go on there The valet: Yes, it is ""forced"" valet, but only in the sense that you have to pay. If you want to park your car yourself all you have to do is insist that you park your own car. Just make sure you hand your keys to the valet before you go inside. Big deal right?And the reason the valet is required to charge you to park your car even if you do it yourself or if it isn't busy is because the lots that the valet uses are owned by the city. The city charges not only you, but also the valet company and the staff of the CCF to park there. It sucks but that's just how it is. The crowd: According to my girlfriend, the busiest times are weekends, weeknights after 6 or 7 PM, anytime during summer, and holidays.  Their reservation times are kind of weird (only certain times for certain days of the week), but if you have a large party of say, 10 or more, they say it's best to send a couple people from your party before the rest of your party arrives, so that they can get you guys on the list without everyone having to wait. Worst comes to worst, if the wait is too long, you can always order food to go.My girlfriend is a cashier and she tells me that the usual quote time for to-go orders is 15-20 minutes (which is a hell of a lot faster than waiting 1 hr + just to be seated!). And when you order to-go, you still get a great view.There is a playground and seats on the beach you can take your food down to that is much more secluded than the seats inside the restaurant. The seating arrangement: We all agree that the seats are really close together and can get kind of annoying.On certain nights when the restaurant isn't too crazy busy (like if it's night time and everyone wants to sit inside because they're cold) you might be pleasantly surprised to find that the patio is usually warmer than the dining room. They keep the heaters all over the patio cranked up to eleven.  Also, about whole cheesecake orders: Order your cheesecake at least 2 hours in advance if you want it to be ready to eat by the time you stop by to pick it up.They keep their whole cheesecakes in a freezer until someone orders one, so if you walk in expecting to get a 10"" Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake all ready to serve in five minutes, don't hold your breath. And as for the sometimes sub-par service: I know by the time you actually sit down and are ready to order you probably had to deal with all kinds of things(a line for the valet, a line to get in the door, waiting for your pager to buzz, etc.),but try to keep in mind that while you are experiencing all of this crazyness, so is the staff, and they have to keep it together while balancing all of their orders and special requests, tracking down a manager, and being stopped for something by someone every time they walk by.  (The CCF is known as a hard restaurant to work at because of the stress involved.) Now of course that does NOT excuse poor service.You went out because you wanted to have an experience and it may not matter to you what the staff may be going through. In this case, just remember that you ARE having an experience, so enjoy it. You've got great food, a great view, and some great company. If you rush the experience you went out for, what was the point? Let's say you're waiting to be seated and it's going to be a while. You can talk to the person/people you came with, look at the cheesecakes, even ask the bakers for some recommendations.The point is to relax and enjoy the entire experience and look at the glass half full. So that being said, my girlfriend and I have made a list of some of our favorite items and also popular items: APPETIZERS: Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls Avocado Egg Rolls Buffalo Strips Tex Mex Egg Rolls Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes Thai Lettuce Wraps ENTREES: Miso Salmon Louisiana Chicken Pasta Cajun Jambalaya Pasta Chicken Madeira Chicken Bellagio Pasta Da Vinci APPETIZER AND ENTREE SALADS: Ceasar Salad Chinese Chicken Salad BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad Seared Tuna Tataki Salad DESSERTS: Original Cheesecake Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake Tiramisu Cheesecake Stephanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake Keylime Cheesecake White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake Lemoncello Cream Torte Dulce de Leche Cheesecake Linda's Fudge Cake Strawberry Shortcake One final note: Don't go to the CCF if you're on a diet. They're known for large portions, sweet drinks, and CHEESECAKE. None of which compute to LOW CALORIE COUNT. Also the calories listed on the cheesecakes are per slice. For example if the calories were per cake, you would divide the cheesecake calories(the Red Velvet cheesecake for instance-1,556)by 12 slices and that comes to about 129 calories per slice - in your dreams!

I didn't try the cheesecake because I'm a bigger chocolate cake lover. We got a slice of the fudge cake which was amazing!!! I was having an ecstasy moment that's how much I love chocolate!

We always get outdoor seating when we go here (we dont mind the wait), because the view of the marina is something to definitely see and it adds up to the ambience while enjoying your time eating with friends and family.

After a ridiculously long wait she appears with a veggie burger and fries. No salad? Why not bring the salad while I'm waiting and where did the burger come from?  Amanda, the manager, said they just made another one. Had to ask for my salad. Comped a slice of cheesecake.

My most recent visit was with the youth group from our church to have a Christmas dinner.  Although the wait was the usual (30-40 min) on a Friday 6pm evening - the wait was pleasant - as we sat on the patio by the firepits having our drinks and exchange Christmas gifts.  Note: there is not drink service at the fire-pit sitting area - however customers are welcome to come to the bar area and order drinks/appetizers and take them out.   We got our table within the advised time inside and it was delightful.  Food appeared fresh and well presented and drinks were re-filled without us having to hunt-down our server.  At the end we order several cheesecakes to share and it was all delivered to us in a maner that it enhanced our dinning experienced... an extra plate for every cheesecake slide - so each person would have their own plate.  Brilliant!!! I appreciated this so much... it was not the usual from the past where there is one plate and 10000 forks.   I am happy to see that the customer service standard has improved for this is a place I have sort of ""grown-up"" with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey

The hostess said it would be just a few minutes. When she walked us to the table the view was of two closed umbrellas and other random stuff shoved in the far back corner of the restaurant.  So we asked if we could just sit pretty much anywhere else. She said to sit down and she would double check about another table. So we did. It really seemed like she forgot about us but about 5 minutes passed and she came back and sat us a few tables over (not next to the window but certainly a better view and feel).  Just after that they sat a lone guy at the table we opted out of.  The server came by... HIS TABLE, brought water and their signature bread. Still, we sat.  Then his specialty drink came. A large group sat next to us.  Still, we sat.  The other guy got his food.  The people next to us were served their food.  Still, we sat. Finally had to disturb a waitress taking yet another order across from us, and asked if she was our waitress.. And that we have been sitting here and don't even have water. She apologized, found a piece of paper to jot down our order and took off. Finally some guy came by to greet us.  Really?... Like 20 minutes later.?! We gave him our order but told him we gave it also to the girl at the order station (pointing in her direction), but before we could ask for bread and water, he went over to her.  So we don't know if she's coming back, or he's coming back, or... Hell who knows!   My friend finally got up and walked over to yet  another waiter and asked for a basket of pumpernickel bread. He said they were out, and my friend said, um no you're not..go find some. She came back to our table and a few minutes later miraculously, they found our bread... as well as some water . FINALLY! Soon after our mushrooms and avocado rolls came out. Really were never checked on again. Not that we were going to order any more after all the chaos we went  through just to get this! Our waiter came by once more to drop the bill and luckily we had cash so we didn't have to wait any longer to get out of this place! You all really dropped the ball! You should be ashamed!

The food is usually good, not distinguishly better or worse than any of their other locations. However, the reason for three stars is because of my home deliveries from this location.  One time I ordered avocado rolls and they arrived looking kind of bad. The avocado looked like it had been sitting out for hours, was a brownish color and it didn't taste good. I've ordered the avocado rolls many times at location and they've been a pretty green color so I know they aren't supposed to look like that. The second time I ordered cheesecake and it had a long strand of hair sticking out from the bottom of the box and the cheesecake :( So the home deliveries definitely need to see some improvement in the future, in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey

Parking was only valet, and the price was $6.50z I enjoyed my shrimp and beef combo.

Thru either forget about your drinks or bring the food late or forget to bring bread . But this last time we went on Jan 1st it was the worst I sent my food  back twice. I ordered shrimp scampi the pasta was to al dente to the point of it being chalky the shrimp was rubbery and had no flavor. It just amazes me that the food is not seasoned correctly .  I guess it depends on the Chef's but when your paying $22 for a bit of pasta and 5 shrimp you want it to taste good . Not going back anytime soon .

Brittany S.,"Hawthorne, CA",13,115,51,1.0,1/8/2018,"I'm ready to cry at how poor the service is tonight. Me and my boyfriend came here on a Wednesday night. Pretty slow and not busy at all. ""Great"" we think. We are seated immediately but they place us at a table with a very bright light when the entire restaurant has intimate settings... like literally the light is shining on me like I'm about to put on a performance. Then after 6 minutes, our server finally comes to us and asks us what we would like to order. SHE DOESNT ASK US IF WE WANT ANYTHING TO DRINK SO MY BOYFRIEND ASKS HER IF WE CAN HAVE SOME WATER. I then notice we don't have bread so I ask her if we can have some bread as well. She says yes. She doesn't come back to us after she gets us our water but our bread still isn't there. It's been about 12 minutes and at this point I get up and go to the front and ask them what's the hold up on bread because that's what cheesecake is known for. The man at the front tells me there's a delay on bread and all the tables don't have them but should be out shortly but I can tell a manager if I want.. I chose not to. I got back to my seat and I'm visible upset so I ask if we can move to a table where it's not so bright. GUESS WHAT!! Our server comes up to my boyfriend and I asks ""so I need to know. Who said something about the bread not being here? How long did it take exactly because this is my name on the line"" I tell her it took 10-11 minutes and she lets me know the kitchen is backed up. That's fine hunty, but that's not how you approach anybody. The entire night was stale and I don't think my server was professional or prompt until she realized she may or may not get a tip. She was a middle aged black woman, natural hair, and slightly shorts didn't get her name but that's okay because I told my boyfriend let's never visit this location again.

Emilio M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1350,467,1264,4.0,5/4/2017,"I was a 5 star fan of The Cheesecake Factory up until this last visit. The loss of a star may sound silly but it meant something to me. So here we go... First the good stuff. What I still love about this TCF is the location. Close to home and if you're visiting from out of town its a special treat because its close to Mothers Beach (a great place to paddle board BTW) and theres a playground close by for the kids to goof around in. The service is as outstanding as ever. Our server was super friendly and accommodating to our every request even though it was super busy. Well played. The food is always great! If you're gonna take a break from a diet plan it may as well be wrecked here. Most meal are over 1000 calories (even some of the salads)  and that doesn't include the cheesecake. I had the Bacon BBQ burger with fries. A burger served up with more bacon than anyone needs and a pile of onion rings on top! A must try!  There is a 'Low Calorie' menu as well but whats the point? One goes to TCF to enjoy life with friends and family. Then came dessert. Where my heart sank. After scanning the dessert menu up and down several times over, I asked the server where the apple cinnamon cheesecake was? ""Oooooh sorry sir, thats been removed from the menu."" . I must have been the only shmuck ordering it? So yeah...for this reviewer the loss of the only dessert that mattered to me being taken out costs The Cheesecake Factory a star. Oh well. La vida sigue I suppose. Misc:  Expect to wait at least 20-45 minutes. We opted for 1st available and were seated outside within a reasonable amount of time. The patio has plenty of heaters plus a better view of the bay and sail boats. Valet parking or a long walk from the public lot. The lot is metered I think? Overall:  The Cheesecake Factory still remains a great place to get a great meal and lighten up your wallet. But for the price one gets a memorable experience. Yeah I'm bummed that the one cake I was craving is gone but I'll get over it. Still plenty of options. Please tip your server accordingly.

Located in the Marina, there is a large valet only parking lot and the dining room and area is very large. You wouldn't really think about this because often times this location is just packed wall to wall. The menu is long and eclectic. The variety of dishes are substantial. Old school favorites such as the Cajun Jambalaya to the Chicken Madeira still exist. Even my favorite default of the Herb Roasted Chicken is still tasty good. Cheese cake/dessert selections are just what they are known for, and a good bar rounds off their fanfare. What keeps me coming back is their consistency and overall great service. My only complaint is that some of their taste isn't as bold anymore, and portion sizes are shrunken inversely to inflation.

Mike P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1,12,5,2.0,11/4/2017,Let me start off by saying the Cheesecake Factory is awesome but not this location. I would suggest you googling The Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach is worth taking a 25-minute ride down there because once you get there you will need Lee be seated because that place is three times bigger than the Marina Del Rey location and you have a better Ambiance still overlooking the harbor. The reason why is because first of all parking there is tight in the valet service is horrible. The reason why it's horrible is because the valet service should know how full the restaurant is since it's a small restaurant because the management or the stuff that the restaurant should be communicating back to the valet attendants letting them know how full the restaurant is because this is one of the smallest Cheesecake Factories they have. The management there is very nonchalant along with most of the workers just because they work at the Cheesecake Factory they have lost touch of reality in the field of customer service. So why wait in a long line that's going to take you about 30 or 35 minutes till we see it and a compact area when you can spend the 25 and 30 minutes go down go down the coast and be out of more comfortable vibrant Cheesecake Factory and spend your money in the place where you feel way more comfortable and at ease and definitely the waiters or servers there are way more professional and friendly hl,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=20

Our first meal was on Fathers Day, the staff and kitchen performed perfectly. It seems (generally speaking) that really busy restaurants do great when they are really busy. Service is faster, more urgent. The kitchen is hall'in ass so they don't get backed up. And yet when the pace is a bit slower the entire process slows down, the servers are MIA for ages it seems. The back of the house lacking the need for speed seems to casually process orders. I believe the slower pace provides an opportunity to get distracted, have some horse play, and the I'm in no hurry today syndrome takes affect. So while we enjoyed both of our meal experiences in the last month, understand that your not in charge of the place.

I swear to God I cannot remember the black waiter's name (something exotic and fruity sounding) but when I do I will update this post; HORRIBLE.  First off for a Sunday wait was not bad. We were seated in like 10 mins...That was the shortest wait we had all evening. It took about 15 mins before we had ANY contact with any staff. A nice white gentleman (Jeff, I believe but not sure) came by, apologized and finally took our drink order. We also noticed 3 OTHER COUPLES who looked as irritated as we did being that were all seated after us and were still waiting. Didnt help either that ""Jeff"" mentioned that our server was working a double as if I cared or that was a logical excuse as to where our actual waiter was. First rule of business you are taught is to never say you are short-staffed, you dont know or you cant help. But here is where things just took a wrong turn: After 30 mins our original waiter STILL didnt show up! So ""Jeff"" finally took our order. Most restaurants, within 30 mins you could already sat, ordered and be halfway through a meal. When our waiter FINALLY came over, he spent at least 7 mins talking to all the other tables. Im sorry but this might get racial but im honest about my reviews so I tell it like it is.. All the other couples were white lol true BUT I noticed the engagement was completely different once he came to our table. His exact words were, ""Y'all need anything else"". Now by this point im pissed and puzzled.....You finally come over after being gone over 30+ mins and not only do you NOt introduce yourself but you address us as if we did something to you?! Took everything inside of me not to grab this idiot and toss him into that nice lake from the view we had...He ended up only coming by once more. He even had his co-worker bring us the check... Talk about feeling discriminated by your own kind. I'll say this in closing: If this Cheesecake Factory does not take the time to address their staff they will eventually close. I guarantee it...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=20

Lots of umbrellas, patio lighting, a great view of the Marina & beach. As always Cheesecake does not fail with the menu! Overall, I highly recommend.

Dara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",190,386,46,1.0,9/4/2017,"Where do I even begin with this review. At this point, this is all comical. SO I had a poor dining experience at The Grove location, as a chance to win me back they sent me a $15 gift card to dine a second time. So tonight's dinner was part compliments of The Cheesecake Factory and this experience was even worse than the first one. I don't want another gift card, I really just don't have the energy to deal with mediocre food AND mediocre service.  We waited 30 minutes for a table, our server takes awhile to bring us water and bread and we ordered right away because we knew it would just be crazy. I order a salad, he orders an appetizer and burger. The appetizer comes out in a good speed but an hour plus goes by and we're like where is our food.... We then get notified that the order got messed up. On top of this, we asked multiple times for new silverwear since ours were DIRTY!!!! He did not bring it, I asked another server who brought it asap. The table next to us also had dirty silverware. That is DISGUSTING, I ate with plastic utensils, I have never in my life done this at a restaurant. My friend asked for ketchup with his burger, never got it. Literally everything that could go wrong went wrong minus finding glass or hair in our food. What a nightmare. It was so bad that I spoke with the manager letting her know what a horrible experience this was. She was apologetic and offered us a slice of cheesecake which we took her up on but jesus, 100% will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=20

It looks nothing like a traditional Cheesecake Factory, not even close. The only reason why I dropped a star was because of all my Cheesecake Factory visits, this location was a little off on the food. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious but being that I'm a connoisseur of the Cheesecake Factory menu, I noticed a difference.  The bread was a little hard and my sandwich wasn't exactly right. I got the chicken and avocado club (one of the best sandwiches ever) but the toast on it was a little past the normal golden brown. The chicken was off a bit also. All that being said.

I go to the Cheesecake Factory ALL the time but leave it to my 21st birthday dinner to have it plummet. When I called they said I couldn't make a reservation after 5 o clock so they said to show up 30 minutes prior and should only be up to a 30 minute wait. When I got there, there was a HUGE wait but the entire restaurant was completely empty! I was told a 2 hour wait! When I spoke to the manager I got some bullshit excuse that they have a policy that's states 80% of the restaurant they keep unoccupied until a specific time? BUT YOU DONT TAKE RESERVATIONS AND HAVE HUGE PARTIES WAITING FOR NO REASON AND YOURE LOSING MONEY? Makes a lot of sense. A party of 9 probably would've spent $500 and they lost out to what keep a table reserved for a party of 2?

With 4of us wait was not bad. CF is usually busy, so I was not going to complain about a long wait. They told us 40 minutes..I think the wait was maybe 30. We sat outside and ordered a drink..didn't even get a sip in before they paged us. I ordered the chicken and waffles again. This was same as in Fresno. Nice crispy waffles, with crispy, tender boneless chicken pieces with poached egg on top. The maple butter was nice on the side. The crispy potatoes maybe twice fried..but they had a nice crisp crunchy texture. Usually side breakfast potatoes can be undercooked, chewy, overcooked, etc..these were nice!

When I said outside she happily said to get out quickly because there is no wait and I needed to go out with my party. We went to the outside area and I told the girl we needed a table for 4 adults and 3 kids. She then proceeded to rudely cut me off and left TO LOOK FOR A TABLE.. yes - the hostess left us there while she was walking around the place checking for a table. Then, some short Asian dude (looked like a manager) came and said there were no more tables and the place was packed. I explained we were just told to come out there to be seated right away and he was like no. Then, the hostess came back and told him there were no tables but tried coming up with a solution but the dude said no and said we could sit in the lounge area or leave. I asked how long it would be and the answer was ""long"". We decided to do the lounge as we were all there already. We sat at a table and asked the waiter to turn in the little heater but guess what: not working. We are something quickly and left. If we didn't have three hungry toddlers we would have left right away.

Even if the service was a bit slow (we waited quite a while for our food) our server was awesome. He was attentive to our needs and had a great attitude.  I ordered the Vegan Cobb Salad with a side of sweet potato sides to share, it was filling and delicious! The ingredients tasted very fresh to my surprise and came with hearty vegetables and grains such as beets, asparagus, avocado, quinoa and more. I topped it off with the balsamic dressing but there are plenty more vegan dressings to choose from. Honestly this is something I can easily make at home and not worth $12, but the company was well worth it!  One bad thing.. while our server was great, there was a lady server who brought out some of our dishes who was incredibly rude. The order for my friends pasta was incorrect and my friend asked her if she will be charged more. The server wasn't giving her a clear yes or no answer so I stepped in and casually and clearly asked her (because the wrong order included an extra ingredient that she didn't order) and she snapped back at me saying that she's trying to communicate that out with my friend. Our whole table was speechless and later I saw one of the male servers scolding her, he was also at the table serving and his face looked very angry when she snapped back at me. I didn't complain to the servers about her but my friends were very angry, maybe more shocked than angry because my tone and words were not offensive at all.

Kyle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,57,6,3.0,5/21/2017,"We have been to the Cheesecake Factory several times for Brunch in the past couple of months. This time we were there to celebrate my Fiancee and I's engagement with our parents who were meeting for the first time.  First of all the food is always great! I particularly enjoy the Eggs Benedict. The yolk is runny (very important) and the English Muffin was well toasted. My Fiancee had the Chilaquiles and she loved them. Crispy tortilla strips and a medium level of spice. We got there right at 10am when they open for Brunch. $6 valet!!! $6 and I watched the guy park the car in the 3rd spot 20 yards from where I was standing. Wow. Our next issue came when we sat outside. We had 7 people in our group and we were walked right out to the patio. They placed a few tables together and moved a few umbrellas and asked us to sit. The seating on one side of the table was sooooo cramped that even my Fiancee (5'2"", 110lbs) had to squeeze in to sit. There were so many umbrellas on the patio that we couldn't move the seats out far enough to sit properly. Now I am not suggesting having less umbrellas, they are totally needed, but the guy who set up the tables didn't even stick around to make sure that his setup was done well. After we fixed the seating ourselves, we looked around for the menus that the waiter was carrying before he set the tables up. We found them stacked on top of the bussing station which was conveniently located on the opposite side of our table. The whole meal we heard crashing and clanging of plates and silverware. Not enjoyable.  Next time I know not to sit in that section of the patio. All in all the experience was OK.

I was beyond offended at that moment, everyone at the table was pretty much done, it was his birthday, your forgot his entire plate and all you could do was a piece of cake?  We were ready to say forget his food, give us boxes for the left overs and we are leaving. But I didn't want to ruin his night so instead I got up and went to speak to a different manager. A male standing near the check in podium and I explained everything to him as he apologized profusely. Now I know they messed up big time, everyone's plates were literally being picked up as the birthday boy finally got his plate but I'm still giving 3 stars instead of 1 for the amazing manager who went out of his way to take care of the birthday boys dish even though he wasn't the one helping us to begin with. I very much appreciate when management takes responsibility and makes sure a guest is well taken care of after a mistake like that. It wasn't a petty piece of cheesecake. I wish I had remembered his name but I thank him for making it a little better.  I will be continue eating at this Cheesecake Factory so long as this doesn't happen again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=80

I feel suffocated and crowded everytime I come. There are so many families and children everywhere it just gives me anxiety. The servers here are a hit or miss too. There are some that know the menu and can tell you what's going on and there are some that are so blehhh about it that I feel like I can't bother them anymore. Mind you I've worked for the company and I know that my customer service was always up to par. It get's 3 stars because the food is good sometimes. It has made me sick before.

The staff are very very friendly and accommodating and obviously well trained. Food is very average and it's a shame because with the ambience and staff it really could be taken up a notch.  Pre made meals I'm not a fan of. I understand the central kitchen concept as it adds to to consistency. Food is bland or over drenched in sauces and flavors.

Christi I.,"Beverly Hills, CA",37,129,255,5.0,7/19/2016,"I really like this Cheesecake Factory. They have award winning waiters like the phenomenal Elias and the strawberry lemonade is amazing! We went yesterday and I wasn't sure what to get. Our server Nicky suggested the steak tacos. I did not realize I had been sleeping on this delightful dish. Cilantro infused rice with black beans and four delectable semi crunchy tacos stuffed with thick, juicy pieces of steak. I mean stuffed!!!! It was garnished with salsa, guacamole and pickled onions and other stuff that tastes oh, so good! I couldn't even finish it all! Nicky was also accommodating enough to let me sample their housemate Sangria. Wow...it was tasty! Delicious notes of cinnamon and fruit throughout. I would've ordered a glass of I wasn't driving. Will get it next time.  After our amazing lunch, we grabbed the black out cake and strawberry cheesecake to go. The blackout cake was decadent. Dark chocolate, fudge, dense and moist...like...the ultimate chocolate make everything better cake. Again, I didn't finish all of my cake. I gave it to my daughter who feverishly inhaled it. It was a huge slice of cake.  We walked out to the beach and dipped out toes in the warm water afterwards. It is five dollars for valet (I was able to self park because I arrived before lunch crowd and it is cheap compared to other beachside parking lots) It was a pleasant way to end a fabulous lunch. This is definitely a place to go for whatever you fancy. They can accommodate and everyone is very attentive. My glass of strawberry lemonade never got empty because they were so on top of things. I even took the time to thank them via the online feedback from my receipt and got myself 5 bucks to use again...please trust...it will be used on my return trip.  Ever wanna contemplate life, cheer someone up or stabilize your mood and fill your belly with delicious food...go and eat on the deck and just be.

Treshaune D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,1,1.0,10/16/2017,"My experience was horrible. First when we were seated it took our server Ron over 30 minutes to take our order. However,  we watch him attend to the two tables on either side of us. Within the 30 minutes it took him to get to us we asked for bread to hold us over. He seemed to be very irritated by our request. My friend expressed to him that she was not happy with her drink and if he could ask the bartender if it could be stronger. He said that he would. He returned to our table 2 times with no response to her questions. She then asked he said that no it could be, and left the drink on the table. The third time he returned she then asked if he could return the drink as she was not satisfied. The next time he came to our table (which was over an hour of us being there) he was clearing the table and spilled 2 full cups of water on the table which spilled all over 1 of my friends and her phone, it spilled on half of my other friend, and spilled a third on myself. We were very shocked as this has never happened and wanted to complain. But our other friend said we have not received our food and to not cause a scene as he might tamper with our food. We assisted with him with getting the water off the table and asked him to please remover the wet bread, silverware, and wet napkins off the table. He did not! We asked for more napkins as we used ours to help him with the water. He came back with the small paper bar napkins ( yet another slap in Our faces). Our good then came to the table. Two out of the 3 plates were cold. We asked him and napkins, and the food being cold and he said, ""you are asking for too many thing at once and I'm getting nervous. When I get nervous I start spilling things like water on people"" and he then laughed. That was it and we asked for the check. We asked if he could split the check and he then said, "" that would take too long, he had other tables to attend too"". I then asked for the manager. I had never experienced such terrible customer service before. I explained all of what happened to the manager. He then stated he would have to get the senior manager of 16 years as this was above his level that he could handle. Steven the senior manager came over and listen to what happened. He stated he would comp the two means that were could as we didn't eat them and give us a free cheesecake. He then asked to pack up our meals and disappeared. When he returned with our food he wished us a good night and told us he would send the first manager over to handle our checks. Once our checks came nothing was comped. We only received free cheesecake. This is truly unacceptable! This experience has made me not ever want to come to this establishment again! I have lost trust in the company's ability to give proper customer service and in the management as well!

Paul K.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,148,8,2.0,8/22/2017,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to.  In fact it is the only one that hasn't been even close to really good.  I suppose we should have figured that out when there was no wait to be seated at 6 PM on a Saturday.  Our first server took a long time to take care of our table. We probably waited 40 minutes for food.  They were out of the brown bread we liked, and of course once we were finished, it seemed all they had was fresh brown bread.   Our nachos, which is something we usually love, were burnt and had minimal toppings and cheese.  What is really pathetic is that we asked for more cheese.  We didn't even finish them.  Not everything was bad.  When the first server went on break, the second one was very efficient.  Our other two appetizers were decent, and the bread was good, albeit not brown. The cheesecake, was of course, very good.  That being said, I'll just go to the one in the Grove or by Disneyland like usual.  Much, much better locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=100
Kelly P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,10,1.0,8/2/2017,"Of the many years I have visited several other Cheesecake Factory establishments, this was the first time I visited this location and let me tell you, it was also the last. I was there a couple days ago, looking forward to having some Cheesecake with my family and as I approach the take out counter, I was greeted by the most rude cashier with the worst attitude (Maryon). The first thing he asked was ""you getting Cheesecake?"" I said yes, and went ahead and let him know what I wanted. I didn't even want to ask any questions to avoid being yelled at. Once he handed me the cheesecakes, I asked him if the receipt was in the bag. After looking around the counter, he found my receipt and threw it in the bag and under his breath he said ""it is now"" and that was it. The total didn't seem right so instead of even bothering to ask this man anything, I decided to call the establishment while I was still in the parking lot. And after speaking to manager (Amanda) it seemed that there had been some miscommunication as far as the rules they had for the deal they had on the cheesecakes for that day (half off). But instead of her apologizing for the error, and the fact that her horrible staff member had the worst attitude and wasn't approachable, she went ahead practically defended him by saying that I should have read the sign. I decided to contact corporate where they were very apologetic for both their employees actions. The price was the last thing I cared about. It was the simple fact that they have the worst people running this place. Horrible customer service. After going through some of the other reviews, I found a few other people who mentioned this same old African American man with the worst attitude. I'm sure many people have complained and clearly nothing has been done about it. Shame on you Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=100

Teresa W.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,14,15,1.0,3/27/2017,"I generally love The Cheesecake Factory and it is disheartening to have to leave a less than stellar review but bias aside I have to be honest. So here we go...   To give background, I called a month prior to make reservations considering the size of our party. I was told that no advanced reservations could be made for Saturdays and we would have to put our name in upon arrival and wait. Fine, no gripes there.  This past Saturday (March 25, 2017) I hosted a large group dinner (27 people) at this location. The first person in our party arrived at 5pm and put our name in. I arrived at 5:15pm and spoke with my friend to inquire about the wait. She told me she was quoted 1 - 1 1/2 hrs at the most 2 hours. We agreed to wait. And we did so patiently. At 7pm we still had not been called and there were multiple large groups of 12 that came after us but were being seated.  The person who originally put our name went to the hostess to inquire. She was told that because the size of the group was the reason for the hold up. In response, the person who put our name in requested that the group be broken up so we could eat since 2 hours had already passed. Ten minutes later they sat 10 people from our group and a few minutes later they seated 9 people at two different tables leaving a remainder of 8 people. Keep in mind this is AFTER the ""at most 2 hours"" quoted time.  It was about 7:30pm when I witnessed a group of 12 people who arrived after my group (I know because as I stated earlier we had been waiting for 2 hours) being called to be seated. At this point I am now angered. How is it that we are STILL waiting with a remainder of 8 people yet 12 who came after are being seated. I walk to the hostess and first thanked her for ""attempting to be accommodating"" and specifically said, ""You do not need to wait for a table for the remaining 8 you can split us according to whatever is the next available. At this point we would just like to eat."" She called over Manuel and I told him the same thing. He said no problem. I understand.  He indicated there was another table of 12 about to leave and we could have that one.  I said thank you, however we do not need to specifically wait on that table. We would like what is next available whatever number that is. He said ok.  Fifteen minutes later, the hostess calls the next table (not us) a group for 6. I immediately asked how is it that another group that was not here before us is being seated. I just requested to take the next available table. The hostess calls Manuel. I pose the same question to him. He tells me ""I don't understand how it works.""  I refreshed his memory on the conversation he and I just had and instead of accommodating he brings Jonathan over to speak to me. I again explain the scenario. And expressed my distaste in service.  I told him we had been disrespectful to no one, had waited patiently and at this point were being straight up lied to.  After this conversation Jonathan seated our remaining 8. The time is now 8:15 pm (I know because I looked at my watch).  As my party was seated I spoke to Jonathan who I believe was the highest manager available at the time. I again thanked him for attempting to be accommodating and seat us all together and also reiterated why I was upset. He tried to explain his side by saying other patrons were quoted times and they needed to be seated accordingly. I refreshed his memory that we were already an hour over the time quoted to us AND that Manuel (another manager) had just told us we would have the next available table yet tried to give it to a different party.  Overall I could not believe this experience. We had 27 people who were dining in your restaurant about to spend at least $700 or more and you push us to the side. Jonathan didn't even want to give a courtesy appetizer. I mean for goodness sake we waited 3 hours!! People were walking by saying ""you guys are still waiting, wow!""  Marina del Rey location please get it together. This is NOT the way you treat customers. And please spare the ""we are sorry you had this experience please give us another chance"" response that I have seen posted in response to others. DO something to mend the situation.

Patrice R.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,140,101,3.0,7/20/2016,"I don't know what happened with the avocado egg rolls but I'd stay away from those if you can. I'm a vegetarian so I thought maybe they were cooked in oil which was used to fry other items and contaminated. However, my coworker also felt sick and she eats meat so either we had a bad batch or they were simply bad somehow. Nonetheless, we were a big party/event of 65+ we sat on the patio which was wonderful with a view of the marina. For an entrée I ordered the Chinese salad w/out chicken. It was satisfactory nothing extravagant, but not bad. We also had sweet potato fries which were good. Overall, I'd say the food quality is a 2 to 2.5 for vegetarians as options are limited. My coworkers enjoyed their food though so I'm going to give it a 3 rating.

The amount of items on the menu here are endless! Out of a zillon things, I ordered the Fried Shrimp Sandwich. The flavor from the sriracha aoli gave the sandwich a nice spicy kick. The shrimp was absolutely crispy and buttery. It was very delicious!  The cheesecakes are TO DIE FOR! I have almost tried every cheesecake here (and lived to write this review...lol.) I can say there is no better cheesecakes made out there (and sold at any restaurants or stores) that could be any better than what the Cheesecake Factory offers...unless you are in NYC. Than the Cheesecake quality turns up a notch or two!  Above all else, This location is a very clean, busy, and friendly establishment. I recommend this spot for any occasion. I believe you should experience a sunset dinner on the patio here in the summertime at least once in your lifetime. You will never regret any part of your experience. 5 stars all around!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=140
Dro E.,"Glendale, CA",0,24,2,4.0,7/6/2017,"I always go to the cheescake located in glendale,CA, and I had never been to this location; however, because of the view, i decided to come all the way from glendale to Marina del Rey. Let me start off with letting everyone know how aggressive staff of valet pariking are. The very first moment we turned into the parking the valet prking guy started screaming ""its $6.5 its SIXANAHALF DOLLA, YOU NEED TO PAY ITS NOT FREE PARKING."" first of all these guys need to chill out, even though $6.50 for a self parking is a lot, im not as much as upset that i am for their rude screaming and asking for money. We definitely wasnt gonna park and run away if we knew it wasnt free. Maybe this location need to train those rude workers and let them know that they arent catching people who are trying to climb and jump over the America-Mexico Great WALL! I wouldnt say the hostess was the best, either, she didnt even say hi and waited 'till i ask her if she works here and could maybe help us,perhaps!!!! The waiter was nice and made good suggestions on the manu. Food was pretty good especially the burger. The heaters in patio were just for one side of the table so one of us shud sacrifice himself for the other. One could enjoy the view and the other experience the ICE AGE.  But the price we paid over all for the parking and  food was definitely worth it. Will be coming back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=140

S. M.,"Santa Monica, CA",5,4,,1.0,7/2/2017,"1 of 2... I have NEVER written a review about a restaurant in my life, but I truly felt compelled to do so today. The first time I visited this Cheesecake Factory, was last month, for my daughter's birthday. For the most part, the experience was good, so I decided to bring my husband back today for his birthday. And, I must say that this was probably the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. My family, friends and I have no desire to ever return there again. I'll start from the beginning. I called the restaurant around 1:30pm, and asked if I could make a reservation. I was told that they do not accept reservations on the weekends. ""Okay. How long is the wait?"" I ask. ""There is no wait right now,"" was the reply. With that, my party of 9 left church, en route to the restaurant. When we arrive, no more than 25 minutes later, the wait is now 1 hour. Wait. What?!? As anyone who has ever visited this restaurant knows, making the choice to leave or stay becomes a tough decision, because you have to valet your car. Or cars, in our case. Three of the people in my party have trouble getting around, so we decide to wait it out. And boy did we wait and wait. (SIDE BAR: During our ""wait time,"" I went to the women's restroom to discover that it only has two stalls; both of which were dirty. The stall that became available when it was finally my turn, was the size of an airplane restroom and is situated next to the lone sink. So, if someone is washing their hands, the stall could not be accessed freely. So, I waited again.) Once I made it out, two people in my party had inquired about what could be taking so long to get a table. Our hour had come and gone. We waited another 15 minutes. Someone must have finally felt sorry for us, because we were digging through our purses and bags for trail mix and mints. We were lead to our table through an endless maze of foot traffic. Things were looking up, we thought. We sat down and quickly placed our drink orders with the waitress. I asked for apps for the entire group, so that we could have something to nibble on while we decided on our orders. My party was so excited when the drinks started coming out, we were finally getting the ball rolling. I was deep in conversation, as our drinks (which mostly consisted of lemonades, soft drinks and water), were being placed in front of us. Until suddenly: WOOSH! My head, back and bottom were shocked by what seemed like the coldest feeling imaginable. The drink server had dropped his entire tray on me. My head, back and bottom were soaked. I gasped in horror. Everyone at my table was mortified for me. Servers, waitresses and managers rushed to me with napkins and towels, desperately trying to gauge my response. The server apologized repeatedly. Long story short, I held it together, and the manager offered me free dry cleaning. Okay. We continued on. Get bread. Order food. Fresh/new drinks. Then suddenly my friend tells the group in horror: ""I think I just drank chipped glass."" What?!? She had ordered a strawberry milkshake. She informed our waitress and another manager came over to us. It was determined that yes, her drink had glass in it. Again I say, What?!? What is going on? I'm thinking, we need to get out of here. We need to just leave. Can this get any worse? Again, my party wanted to forge ahead. It's my husband's birthday. We're hungry. We're already two hours in and my friend says she feels fine. Okay, we'll stay. We wait and wait. Finally the apps come out. Yes! We're starving. We quickly devour them. Drink refills. Still no entrees. We wait and wait. And then finally, the food slowly starts to come out. My husband and I get our food first and the group, almost in unison says: ""Please don't wait for us!"" And, thank God we didn't. It would be another 15 minutes before the last person in our party gets their food. Everyone is finally eating, which is uneventful for the most part. My food was good/fine. But, do you remember my friend with the milkshake? She has to send her food back, because her meat was under cooked. Really under cooked. She taps out. She wants nothing else. At this point, she's just waiting for the rest of us to finish. We finish up. Sing Happy Birthday, and it's time to pay the check. My friend's milkshake and food are comp'd. Me, on the other hand, am fully charged for my meal. Really? While I'm still sitting here soaking wet? From my head to me feet? AND, I just discovered that my purse, which was sitting on the floor, is also soaked inside and out? Maybe I'm foolish for thinking my meal was going to automatically be comp'd after what happened to me. At any rate, the waitress talks to the manager, and gets my meal is comp'd. To be continued...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=140

Beyza B.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,8,19,1.0,7/3/2017,"Unfortunately my last time at Cheesecake Factory was a terrible experience. First of all I have to say that this place's location has a really good view and I have always loved the light decoration they did. However, service was terrible! I went there with my family and family friends to celebrate birthdays of two people in the group. So we were 11 people. And our waiter whose name is Ronald did a terrible job.  - We asked drinks to come with foods but we were about to finish the meal when he brought them. And there were only 3 drinks so it shouldn't have taken that much of time - We asked for ranch sauce or mayo but he never brought it - He brought appetizers too late. We had to asked them twice after he brought main courses  - He didn't take empty glasses on the table. He should have taken them before taking our dessert order. When he brought cheesecakes, the table was a mess! - We were there for birthday celebration for two people and I know that normally waiters sing happy birthday when they bring the cake however, singing didn't happen and this guy didn't even bother to light up the candles! - He put all the coffees on one side of the table he didn't bother to serve them person by person and for this reason, we mixed up which one is decaf which one is a normal coffee - My 3 year-old nephew broke a glass and he didn't clean it up! Glass particles were there and one of us could get hurt especially my nephew! - At the end of the dinner, when one of us gave voice to our complaints, he refused all of the complaints and was very rude.  After awhile, he came back and spoke with the kindest guy in the group and apologized to him. He couldn't even apologize to the person who told him about the complaints!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=140

edgar t.,"Diamond Bar, CA",9,15,10,2.0,10/2/2016,"So I was there Wednesday night on September 21st.  Some relatives had came over to visit. Because it was last minute (and because usually we enjoy The Cheese Cake Factory at another location), we decided to try out this location since it was the the closest location at the time.  Let me start by saying that it was a big party-seventeen of us to be exact. So I understood that when we got there, we were going to have to wait. I didn't mind at all that we waited 2.5 hours to get seated. At first it was like every other Cheesecake Factory; They sat us down and our waiter was nice and patient. Our food was served at a timely manner as well. Towards the end though when my father wanted a refill a coffee, he was told that there wasn't anymore coffee.  The manager came and specifically let us know that gratuity was not included in the check and asked us to take care of the waiter. I found that a little bit rude, but yet I still took care of him due to our party size.  And then as we were leaving, I wanted a piece of cheesecake to take home. There were two workers there next to the dessert display and I felt no amount of courtesy as I was standing there waiting there for a couple minutes; waiting for them to offer to help me.  I heard them complain about the other guests (very unprofessional) and one of them looked at me and I told them ""I would like to purchase a cheesecake please"" and they said,"" Sorry we're closed"" and returned to their gossiping. Then I noticed the manager walking behind me. I told him I would like to purchase a cheesecake (keep in mind this is the same manager that a couple minutes ago had no problem taking the expensive paid bill of 17 people that I just handed him). His response was ""Sorry that section is closed"".  Very disappointed. Where's the customer service? Being that I own a business of my own, it is a rule that as long as a customer is there, we make sure that he is taken care of. I wanted to complain, but this was the manager! I couldn't believe it.  As far as the food, just go to another Cheesecake Factory location, because the service from this one will leave a bad taste in your mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=140

Angela B.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,144,96,1.0,11/16/2016,"WOW! The worst experience ever!!! My family and I brought my brother here for his birthday dinner...I wish I never recommended this place because the whole thing was a disaster! I understand that many people were at the location especially since it was a Saturday night but to have an experience like we did was VERY uncalled for. We waited an hour and half when we were told that the wait would be only 45 minutes. After waiting for an hour and half we finally get to our seats. Our server greets us a good 15 mins after we have been sitting, no menus, no water, no one walking up to 10 people sitting at a table looking at each other. Then finally she greeted us and gave us menus. She took our drink orders and left. We waited for another 20 mins just to get our drinks and bread which we asked for numerous times....We finally got our waters minus the other drinks and two tiny trays of two piece breads in them for 10 people who have already been waiting at the table for over 45 minutes. We had ordered appetizers with our drinks which she recommended a platter and when we asked if we were ever going to get the platter she said oh they didn't tell you we ran out...(why would anyone else tells us anything when you are the server and barely you even come around!) We then tell her its fine if we can please have some more bread since we wont be getting any appetizers. She says right away and we do not see her for another 15 mins...In the meantime we ask others and they said yes we are making some we ran out and you should have some soon. Ya rightttt we got some I just don't understand how you can run out of food when you are a multi chain restaurant which I have been coming to for years! I wish the only wrong thing was the lack of food and service. But then of course like the whole night we are waiting for our entrees with empty glasses, impatient children, rude service and a ruined birthday celebration. My sister had gone up to the manager letting him know what we were going through. He then comes to our empty table and was asking how we were I then began to tell him that this is uncalled for and a waste of time for all of us! He clearly did not want to hear how unsatisfied we were because when I was talking to him very nicely for someone who has been going through this terrible night at his managing location he then rolls his eyes at me.

The second time my boyfriend and I came here, which was tonight, we brought my mother (she couldn't read the menu because it's so freaking dark)... Theres a fine line between setting the mood and playing hide and seek.  Anyways, they completely forgot about us AGAIN!

We were really annoyed about the valet parking charge, of course the prices aren't posted when you drive in to the lot.

Chanel O.,"Los Angeles, CA",531,117,217,4.0,6/25/2014,"This was the first time that I've been to The Cheesecake Factory on the mainland.  I've been to the one in Hawaii a few times and have always felt overwhelmed by the menu.  It is huge! This time, I was craving carbonara the other night so my boyfriend suggested coming here because he loves The Cheesecake Factory.   The Marina del Rey location was the closest to my apartment.  Driving in, there is only valet, which costs $4.50 during dinner.  There seemed to be a lot of people outside, so we asked the valet if it was a busy night.  He told us not really and that the wait seemed to be only about 10 minutes, but when we walked inside the hostess told us about 30 minutes. x.x  We decided to wait because we had our mind set on pasta.   The hostess was not very friendly, which was kind of a turn off for my first impression of the restaurant.  Also, the bathroom was pretty dirty for such a pretty restaurant.  There was trash everywhere and the ground was wet.  It didn't seem like anyone came in to clean the restroom often.   We decided to wait at the bar and grab a few drinks at the bar before dinner.  He had a classic mojito and I had the pink lemonade cocktail, as suggested by the bartender. They were both delicious! Mind did not even taste like alcohol, but you could tell they were both strong.  We ended up getting seated in about 15 minutes so we had to take our drinks with us to the table.  We sat outside on the patio and it was so beautiful! You are right on the water under a cascade of beautiful lights.  Since it's summer, the weather was perfect and we asked our server to lower the heat lamps above us.  The setting was perfect.   To start the meal, the freshly baked bread was hot and delicious.  The wheat and honey bread was fantastic.  We also had an order of calamari for our appetizer.  It was crispy and came with marinara sauce and some type of creamy sauce.  For our entrees, we ordered the chicken carbonara and the cajun jambalaya pasta.  They were both tasty.  The jambalaya pasta wasn't too spicy and came with both chicken and shrimp.  The carbonara was the perfect consistency; not too heavy.  To finish our meal, we ordered the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  There were oreos baked in the cheesecake and it was layered with some type of fudge cake and some type of milky icing.  It was topped with a giant oreo cookie! I normally do not care for cheesecake, but this one had a good amount of chocolate to make me happy ^.^",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=300

Brandon C. was our waiter and he did a wonderful job at helping out our table.  Fortunate for us, we had two (very) senior people at our table and he was super patient with them!  Thanks! For drinks, I had a lemondrop martini.  The drink tasted like a very concentrated lemonaid, but boy did it kick a punch!   It came in a sugared rim glass and a lemon twist.   Very clean and refreshing!  Grade:  B For my main meal, I decided to order a tapas sampling from their ""skinny menu"".  The first dish was an arugula salad.  YUM!  The dish was baby arugula served with freshly sliced parm cheese, and toasted almonds and yellow rasins.  The dressing was a citrus and olive oil sauce and it was simply delicious!  Grade:  A- My second tapas sampling was the beet & goat cheese salad.  This dish was red beets cubed, tossed with granny smith apple chunks, and served with arugula salad and toasted pecans.  The salad had a lot of potential, but somehow it missed the mark for me.  Perhaps it was because the beets were dull (didn't taste like freshly cooked beets, nor did they taste like canned beets).   Nothing popped out at me while eating the salad.  Grade:  B- My third tapas sampling was the artichoke heart and krab dip.  There was a dip made up of artichoke hearts, krab pieces, and cream sauce.  Served with about 6-7 slices of French bread toastinis.   This dish missed the mark for me.  In fact, it took 2 bites of the dish and decided to throw the rest away.  It lacked flavor, and it tasted like it was slopped together.  Wasn't worth the stomach space.  Grade:  D- For my dessert, I orderd the red velvet cheesecake!  OMG DELICIOUS!   This was the highlight of my meal!  This was two layers of red velvet cake, with a middle of cheesecake, and topped with a rich cream cheese topping.   This was perhaps the best cheesecake that I've eaten at this restaurant chain!   The serving was huge and it was fun to eat!  Grade:  A-. What I liked best about the dining experience was that the menu was HUGE!  There was like 20 pages of a menu - varying from American, to Asian, to a bit of creole in the dish choices.  There is always something for everyone to eat here - and this was reflected in the very diverse clintele eating here!

He said nothing about hitting our car and just ran away. Luckily he didn't do any damage to our car so I just left. Don't trust your cars with Valet.

Marina M.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,4,1,1.0,8/8/2017,"I normally don't like to leave negative reviews but I had the worst experience here.  On July 29th a group of friends and family decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory for a birthday dinner. It was a Saturday so I get it, there is a wait etc. we got to the Cheesecake Factory at around 6:40 and we're told it would be about an hour to an hour and 40 mins which we said was ok. Closer to 8pm we asked and the first person we asked said they were signing the for bill, 20mins later we asked again they said the same table was finishing dessert !?! But I thought they were finishing up with the bill. Then closer to 9 we were told they were opening gifts and if we wanted we can split the group and sit in separate tables! We came as a group for a birthday!! Once we got seated almost 3 hours later, the waiter spilled ice water on my friends mother she was yelling and they just said sorry. Manager looked and said ok I'll give you guys free calamari. They didn't bother to ask if she was ok if she needed anything didn't even turn on the outside heater. Our waitress was horrible didn't ask if we needed anything we had to repeat ourselves. Then remind her who ordered what. Who ever replaced her during her break was amazing we wanted him to stay. But sadly he was only covering for her but in that short break he was able to lift up our spirits with his positive vibes. We had to end the night early but they were giving us a hard time cause we needed to spilt the bill and they didn't want to do it more than 3 ways. I'm glad I was able to leave closer to 10:40, sadly the rest of the group stayed till nearly midnight.  I will never go back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=120

Unfortunately we did wait over two hours for a party of ten but it could be because everyone was going there for graduations and there were a lot of big parties that night. They did allow us to wait in their outdoor patio and order drinks and appetizers. Already frustrated with our wait time, we came in upset from being so hungry. Iman, however, made our visit more than pleasant. He was very enthusiastic and made us feel so much better about everything. He was definitely an excellent example of great customer service even as we were walking out the door to leave. Made the environment way more welcoming than the girls at the front.

Erika M.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,1,1.0,10/19/2017,"Had the worst experience here ever! I went in yesterday I was sat at 5:50pm, happy hour ended at 6. No one greeted me until 6:10pm. One server put in my order (and got it all wrong) but wasn't my server in the end. I didn't know they had even switched. The new server rushes past and slams 2 lemonades on the table, no napkins, water or bread at 6:25pm. However we had ordered an ice tea and a margarita. The manager came and we told him, he apologized and made the comment that he had 2 capable servers and had no idea why they weren't on it. We ordered sliders no onions, pasta with extra sauce and stuffed mushrooms. My pasta came out before the bread with NO SAUCE (all the sauce on the side) by itself. No sliders and my appetizers no where in sight. The manager again apologized and took my plate back. The mushrooms arrived cold-warm and the sliders had tons of onions. At this point I was over it. My pasta was brought out correct and by this time it had been an hour of dealing with issues. When the appetizers arrived we had to ask for bread and utensils. When I asked for the check they charged me full price for everything. Happy hour items full price even though the first server said he would get us the HH price since we had to wait so long to order.

Sofia N.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,26,23,1.0,9/14/2016,"This review is for the service and how we were treated at our visit.  We love to go here and always did it at special occasions with my friend that was visiting town. So after not have being here for about a year we decided to have one last night out here before she returned home from her vacation. We were a party of 7 and already when ordering a table the girl looking for a table was being rude in her attitude. It was a Tuesday night around 8.30 and not too crowded.  The service was NOT in any ways okay. We ordered simple drinks, water, wine and beer. Nothing hard or time consuming. The 3 waters came out, we waited. Appetizers came out before ANY drinks at all and we probably waited 20-30 minutes for a lemonade, 2 wine and 1 beer. Oh and yes they forgot the coke zero. The red wine was too warm assuming they had just ignored carrying out the drinks in time. We didn't get any of the dark breads and when we asked the waiter said ""no they hferklgmösgmnls"" and he left. No one could hear or understand what he said and he didn't even care about the fact that we had waited probably 40 minutes for the bread at all. I don't eat the white bread because I don't like it and we were never bought any dark bread even after asking. So, I was STARVING, annoyed by the fact that the service had been so bad and just cranky.  Oh food finally, we thought. we got 3 of the meals and waited politely for everyone to get their meals. You would think they would bring out everything at the same time right? Nope! Same as the drinks something came, something had to be waited for, and of course.... One meal had been screwed up so she got a small bowl of veggies but not her tacos and had to wait for her food even longer while everyone else had gotten their foods.  Yes, desert time. Not everyone could order cheesecake so we need up only ordering 3 of them. Waited another 20 minutes for 3 cheesecakes to be boxed up and the check.  Did i mention that not once did any of the 3 waiters approaching our table ask if we were okay, apologizing for all the mistakes and waits we had experienced and all they said was ""Thank you for understanding and being patient."" NO we did not understand WHAT was taking so long and no we were NOT patient we were all hungry and cranky.  Will probably NOT go back here again, at least not to the Marina location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=120

This one has been here for awhile, and it shows. Decor is a bit drab. The staff, though friendly, can be slow, and the food is exactly what you expect from Cheesecake Factory--decent in a formulaic way without being excellent.

Of course, because we're in the city of expensive people, they charge for valet parking which is your only option as well.  For lunch on the weekdays, if you are on a rush, it may not be a good idea. During the weekdays, they are typically short on staff so service is not speedy. On the weekends, the staff is plentiful but expect a 1-2 hour wait. Since my first time dining at Cheesecake, I have been a huge fan of their pasta selection. But now that I've grown older and become more fonder of other foods, my new favorite is the Miso Salmon.  They have a lunch special in their main menu (Miso Salmon is included) which is a steal for~$12. Portions are very generous and I was stuffed halfway into my entrée.

Then he just led us to a table he didn't even ask if we wanted to be seated outside.  As we got our waitress she was ok, but she only came to our table twice: for our drinks and when we ordered. We ordered avocado rolls which were really good and the chicken manidera was ok. Considering that the mashed potatoes were really soggy.

The beachside seating has an amazing view and ambiance that can't be beat. This is one of the few MDR restaurants that has stood the test of time. The only downside is they don't take reservations at all, so during busy times the wait can be significant. I'm also not a fan of forced valet parking. Even if you choose to park the car yourself, you still have to pay the valet fee.  The menu is fantastic, with something for everyone. The portions are huge, so be ready to leave with a takeout bag. I love the breakfast section of the menu for Sunday brunch. If you're like me, you'll find a favorite menu item and get it every time. For dinner I love the Chicken Madiera.  On special occasions, I'll save room for cheesecake. There are so many options, the hardest part is choosing which to get.

Lewis Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",296,189,4437,5.0,3/8/2012,"I have to first start off by saying this is the BEST CHEESECAKE FACTORY I've been to by far. From the delectable foods and ambrosial ambiance to the delightful decor  and surprisingly speedy service, this location cannot be rivaled.  The main purpose for going to this location was to catch it to have dinner before the sunset! Apparently that didn't quite work since I live in Southern LA area and it being LA traffic was a major factor.. I didn't quite make it on time and got there when the sun was already in! Either way I still go to enjoy the perfect weather and breeze this place offers. Upon arrival the inside looked quite small so the hostess offered the ""Beach Front"" which I had no idea what it was, thought the patio was where we were going to be seated, I was wrong, this place is actually closer to the water and from what I heard she said its ""NEW"". I was amazed how everything look well set up... you have fire pits, cabanas, lounge etc. It was just amazing how everything looked, you wouldn't think it was Cheesecake Factory... and that is why I say.. THIS IS THE BEST ONE I'VE BEEN TO! Another thing you have to keep in mind if you want to dine in the Beach Front.. they only offer the Top 100 dishes on their menu. Now on to the service!.. Service was GREAT and our waiters name was IAN. I asked what drinks he recommends and which will have a better acquiring taste! He was on top of things very polite and never once did he disappear after he took our order (which usually happens at most places.) I assume at times waiters know who looks like a ""BIG TIPPER"" so they tend to cater more to those people. But that was not the case here because I sure don't look like or dress the part of a BIG TIPPER, but in this case I did not mind putting down a 15% from a $133 bill. I never put that much down as a tip, but felt like he really deserved it! Now on to the food!.. Since I was outside and its only TOP 100 dishes, to me they all sound good. Dishes I got to try were: Fried Macaroni & Cheese Balls: (10/10) WOW!!.. ORGASMIC!!.. I shed a couple of tears after trying this. Soooo cheesy and the taste was just incredible. With the first bite I really didn't wanna share the rest, wanted all 4 of them for myself! Chicken Alfredo: (10/10) This is definitely on my TOP 3 Alfredo List!.. One good thing that gave it a plus and out-shined the others was the BIG chunks of chicken that come with this dish!.. enough said.. THIS PLATE IS A MUST!   Crispy Chicken Costoletta: (10/10) I'm a picky eater so when I saw asparagus I just glanced over on to the next item.. but here comes IAN to the rescue again and recommended this dish. So took his word and I was really amazed. It was 3 thin sliced breast and lightly breaded which makes it better (too breading makes certain items not worthy) and for the side dish was mashed potatoes!... and what makes these potatoes better than others?.. RED POTATOES & CHUNK BITES!!.. So it's not all that mushy (hope that's a word!) Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: (10/10) GRAND FINALE was this... ORGASMIC!!!... TWICE!!.. It was just an amazing day with food and the scenery and to top it of with this dessert!

Erika M.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",218,343,591,4.0,8/21/2014,Great selection of food as with any Cheesecake Factory. You have the option of seating inside or outside.

Bethany P.,"Los Angeles, CA",147,56,58,3.0,7/7/2015,"Arriving into the Cheesecake Factory the valet seemed very eager to take our money before we even parked. My dad assured him we were going to park first then pay. BTW parking is like $5. We were seated in a booth area and our waitress came over. She seemed really stressed and seemed like she was having a terrible day. My mom has a food allergy to mushrooms and we ordered a pizza and 20 mins later the pizza arrives by a different waitress covered in mushrooms! Whether it was the waitress or one of the chefs who didn't get the order correct it wasn't a big issue we just asked the woman who gave us the pizza to please remake it. Our original waitress came back and this time she seemed like she had real attitude when my mother asked to please make sure they didn't just pick the mushrooms off and then bring it back out (sorry these things happen....). Instead of seeming sympathetic she sort of got aggressive and kept saying something like ""we all know"" already when my mom asked why the pizza had mushrooms on it. Then she condescendingly at the end of one of her remarks called my mother ""honey"" or ""hon"". And so it began.... Food: My parents ordered the Mediterranean Salmon which came with potatoes and artichokes and tomatoes. They said their food was very good. From what I saw it looked good and the portions were huge! I ordered the SKINNYLICIOUS® Fresh Vegetable Salad. I noticed it said pomegranate dressing which seemed new to me so I tried it. I love pomegranates and I know how they taste so when my salad came out it looked good and I had a couple bites but knew something was off. Every bite I took the dressing tasted like car motor oil. Of course I've never tasted car oil but it had that weird aroma too it. idk how to describe and when you would try to wash it down with some water it would burn. I'm usually not too picky but at this point we agreed it would be better to request for a new one since I was ready to puke. After a while the manager came out and was super nice! He is the reason why I am adding on another star. He apologized to my mom and gave us a complementary corn soup which was super delicious. He was very humble and attentive unlike the waitress who was agitated at that point. The new salad that they gave me was great and I got balsamic vinaigrette on the side I recommend that or at least taste test whatever the hell they put on the salad. Overall this salad tasted amazing and fresh the second time around! After some time the waitress came back and asked how the salad was and I told her it tasted way better. Of course at this point everyone in my family was tense and I just wanted to go home. Since it was my mom's birthday we ordered 3 cheesecakes. 2 raspberry lemon ones and one chocolate one. That experience went smoothly at least there was some moment of positivity with all the chaos. The cheesecake was great too! We didn't finish all our food so our waitress came back and was struggling bagging everything and later when we got home the corn soup was spilled all over the bag....Also good luck getting water in this place...I had to track down like 3 men to fill up the glasses of water. They were super chill though and service was fast on that.  I just want to thank the manager so much for stepping in and helping resolve the conflicts. I've worked in food before and understand the frustration with people, orders, and tension but man what a buzzkill to someone's birthday -_- Thank god we had a $75 gift card here because the food came out to about $100 not including tip and for the experience it was not worth it! I hope some of that tip makes it way to the manager he was awesome! I wish I knew his name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=480
Persila N.,"Irvine, CA",670,396,594,4.0,4/1/2014,"If it wasn't for the wait, this rating would be a 5.  This is by far my favorite Cheesecake Factory location.  The view over the Marina is spectacular.  They have outdoor seating on the patio overlooking the water, a lounge area with fire pits, and heat lamps sprinkled all over.  If you prefer to sit inside, they have a decently sized dining room there as well and also have a bar in case you want to grab a bite to eat or a drink before you start your dinner.  Most people choose to do valet parking here because parking can be difficult or a hassle to find in the area.  On a Friday or Saturday night for a party of 4, the wait time was around 40-45 mins around 7:30pm.  They do not take reservations but they try to accommodate large parties.  Although I have never really ate anything bad here, I would suggest going for the Factory Burrito Grande if you want a burrito (it is ridiculously large).  As for good appetizers, I like the Tex Mex Eggrolls or the Avocado eggrolls (these are well known).  Their BBQ chicken pizza is also good, as well as their Chicken salad sandwich, Navajo sandwich, Chicken Piccata, Chicken Bellagio, etc.  If you are trying to be healthy, then they have rolled out a new menu called ""Skinnylicious"" that has many tasty options that are under 600 calories each (some under 500).  I recommend the Skinnylicious Lemon Garlic shrimp (a decent portion that has a great flavor served with angel hair pasta) , as well as the Skinnylicious Salmon that comes with vegetables.  The menu can be quite overwhelming actually, but do not fret.  It is hard to choose something bad.  And if you haven't already, definitely try a slice of their cheesecake.  I might be a plain-jane, but I can't get enough of their Strawberry Cheesecake.  Delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=480

Marco D.,"Malibu, CA",480,347,193,3.0,10/14/2012,"Dined there with a group of 4.  The wait sucks ass, I don't know what it is about a food chain restaurant that makes people want to run to it. 45 minutes for a table was a bit much, thank god that our hostess was kind enough to honor our request for first available booth.  The service was phenomenal, our waiter was amazingly kind and helpful. Bad note on the bartender for not knowing how to make a Jack Rose but it's ok. Our booth was facing a window that overlooks the Marina which would be great but the moon wasn't out so it was a big dark nothing.  As far as the food goes, the menu is one giant encyclopedia of everything. I understand that as a chain they have to keep their options open to appeal to as many people as possible but come on, you don't put the chicken tacos next to the Fillet Mignon.  I had the Cobb salad and my group had New Orleans Shrimp (ok) and two Petites steaks (not good at all). My salad was good but not worth the 16 dollars. Then again you don't come here for the salad so up to you.  This place is safe but that is all, don't expect to be surprised or to walk out with a smile in your face.

On top if your lucky to get valet to take you, you have about 30 people PLUS waiting outside the restaurant which makes you feel it's much harder to breath in. The wait time was 40 minutes to an hour for a table! lol Luckily my girlfriend and I ordered over the phone as I was heading over there from Covina, California I was out on hold for literally 20 min before they took my order! I understand it's busy and I do not hold that against them but I would have at least liked to have been told I was gonna be on hold for more that 15 minutes. Long story short, the place is just to crowded and full of people that make it look like a dmv waiting in line. I wouldn't recommend this location only cause of all that chaos.

Jay T.,"Irvine, CA",132,382,56,5.0,3/10/2012,"This was hands down the nicest Cheesecake Factory I've been to. I haven't made it to the original in Beverly Hills, but this one definitely tops the one at the Grove. Waterfront location, right on the Marina, especially if you go to the ""Beachfront"" section. The great view makes up for the lack of the full menu. I came here with my gf on a Fri night, so the place was pretty crowded. I don't know how long it would have taken to get seated inside, but the wait for the outdoor ""Beachfront"" was about 5 minutes. This area is pretty big, and it seemed a bit understaffed as the waiters were all quite harried, but that didn't result in a negative experience. They were all extremely courteous, down to filling the water glass as soon as it was empty (if not before). As far as I can tell, everything on the menu is pretty great. The items that cost more than $12 end up actually being cheaper because there's too much food and you can take half home for another meal. And you can always have as much complimentary bread as you want. Go for the wheat, it's great. The sourdough isn't bad, but it pales in comparison. The main downside of this location is the mandatory valet parking in the lot in front of the restaurant. Being the cheap suburbanite I am, I decided to just park on Washington (the meters are free after 6) and walk the couple of blocks over instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=520

The issue was service!  No one ordered anything strange. One girl got an individual pizza, one got chicken tacos, I got fish tacos and someone had a salad. Nothing too complex. When the food was ready, the server brought 2 plates out to our table and then walked away. Now, me (fish tacos) and my friend (chicken tacos) sat waiting for our food.  And we sat. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited.  Now lucky for our server we were all chatting and gabbing and enjoying one another's company. However when a good 10 minutes had passed and still no food, we started to get a tad cranky.  Someone (a manager of some sort?) stopped by our table to inqure as to what we were waiting on. We told him an order of chicken tacos, and an order of fish tacos. He said he'd go get our food for us- even looked in the direction of the kitchen and told us our food was ready and he saw the server getting it now.  LIAR.  Another 5 mintues later the server brought our food. If you are keeping track, it's been 15 minutes since our friends got their entrees. They were pretty much finishing up their meals. The server apologized and he said he'd go grab the manager. The manager came by and apologized. That's it.  When we all ordered a slice of cheesecake for dessert and got the bill we were SHOCKED that they didn't do anything to make up for their error. There was no free slice of cheesecake, no measley $5 gift card for our troubles, not even a discount on the bill. Nothing. We still tipped the waiter well- it wasn't his fault. But the fact that they think that is acceptable is really telling.  I will never return to any cheesecake factory again. The place is so over- priced, especially for a crappy chain restaurant. And for such trashy service, any moron could figure out how to remedy the situation. Maybe that's why they work at Cheesecake factory. It probably didn't help their cause that the 4 of us are in sales and would never treat a customer that way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=520
Cheryce S.,"Lakewood, CA",131,11,4,2.0,11/23/2015,5 stars for the waiter he was great! I came and visit this location with my family for my little cousin birthday on 11/15/15. Of course it was slow to get a table but it worth for a 4 star restaurant . What I have a problem with there bugs on the table where forks and spoons are on. I have newborn what if the bugs crawl on him we tell the manager she said sorry that's it who doesn't want to do nothing. So I have to pay for food I don't even want to eat! I didn't get no offer to come back or I'm sorry food on us please come back. I spend too much money! I have been another location who the manager treat me great because they was hair in my food. I go home and throw food away have to clean my baby bag out we even got video the roach crawling nasty!!! I contact the company I hadn't even got a call that's bad taste in my mouth. I travel far to eat there when I could of went to new location in Cerritos !  Make sure your table is clean I would ask for new folks I hope I didn't eat any bugs eggs,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=520

Asdik U.,"Glendale, CA",5,4,,1.0,7/18/2016,"YES, I was having a great day before I walked into the Cheesecake Factory!!!! On Sunday July 17, 2016, my girlfriend , her mother and I went to the Cheesecke Factory. We were there at 7:15. We were told it would be a 40 minute wait for seating, however, we didn`t sit till an hour later. We were understanding because it was a Sunday night and that is one of their busiest days. My girlfriends mother uses a walker and when we were escorted to our CORNER, we asked if we could sit 2 spots away from us where the seats were available to acomodate the 3 of us. ( Please be aware that she has a fold away walker and not a wheelchair.) The person said no, we need to sit at the corner. At this point, the 3 of us felt we were discriminated especially because nobody sat at the other table for another 10 minutes later. So it was available. Yes, the table was clean and ready for customers to sit, we checked. After sitting at the table which was really cramped up, we felt very uncomfortable. Example, there were unopened unbrella posts and round umbrella basses which were disallowing my girlfriend to sit comfortably. I asked for the manager, he pulled the table back a few inches. This really did not solve the issue. The right thing to do was to , even if we needed to wait a few moments, was to change tables. Manager did not do his job. After UNCOMFORTABLY sitting, we ordered food and instead of trying to make us feel better the manager brought out bread and 3 little packets of butter. THAT IS JUST GREAT, WE ALL GOT 1 EACH. SO GENEROUS!!!!!!  Anyhow, moving right along, I go to Cheesecake Factory in other locations and always get the eggplant parm and all waitresses and waiters till now ask me if I want cheese on it. My waiter did not and this was not an issue for me at all. The issue here is, instead of making things better it got worse. I asked him for the grated cheese and he said he`ll get it. I turned over to my girlfried and said to her ""I BET YOU HE`LL EITHER FORGET OR BRING IT WHEN I`M DONE WITH MY FOOD"". Guess what.... I WON THE BET!!!! When I was down to my 1/4 piece of eggplant out of the 5 or 6 pieces they give you, he showed up. I looked at him and i said ""TELL ME YOUR JOKING""!!!!!! Anyway, I will never go back again, ruined my night. By the way, he forgot my cheese....and I forgot his tip !!!!          .HORRIBLE SERVICE   Make sure Cory is not your waiter and Jonathan is good for nothing!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=500

Alice M.,"Mar Vista, CA",584,404,1028,4.0,8/26/2011,"I used to think if you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all. Not so with the ""bistro"" side of this location! Luckily, we were tipped off by the hostess, who told us there was a much shorter wait, if any, at their adjoining bistro. The bistro looks nothing like a Cheesecake Factory. It looks like you rented a private cabana by the sea and happened to have a huge craving for cheesecake. We were seated in a cozy corner spot, right next to a fire pit and with a great view of yachts in the harbor. Awesome date spot for a summer evening! We were in the mood for a ""tapas""-style dinner, so we ordered a bunch of small plates to share: fried calamari, crabcake bites, crab & artichoke dip, and margherita flatbread pizza. The fried calamari were crispy but could definitely benefit from a nice marinara sauce instead of the cocktail sauce it came with. The crabcake bites were just as delicious as I remembered! (For whatever reason, I've always been fond of crabcakes at Cheesecake Factory.) The dip was a little greasy and salty... not my favorite. The margherita pizza was impressive. The basil was fresh and the flatbread was just the right balance of crispy and fluffy. Since we were at Cheesecake Factory and we inadvertently went on National Cheesecake Day no less, we had to get some cheesecake for dessert. Much to my dismay, they were out of Oreo, but the banana creme cheesecake was a wonderful substitute. MM went for the more classic strawberry topped cheesecake and I couldn't help but steal a bite. The service was great and the ambiance was unlike any chain restaurant I've ever dined at. For that, I'm definitely a fan!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=500

Ron B.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,86,53,1.0,11/2/2014,"Feel like sardines in a can, as this place has as many tables as can be set, and inadequate privacy and space between tables!  BAD Salmon, old, soft texture- sign of bad fish thus dated. Horrid! $20 for this- fish farmed salmon?  Poor Parking with Valet, charging $4.50- looking at these guys - I wonder if they have drivers licenses?  Dirty Restroom, inadequate size for number of customers. Urine over floor. Sinks filthy!! Inadequate waiting area, for people to wait for table. THUS people are bunched all together, and no room to safely (by law also) to enter and exit!!  THUS- ISLE space seems a night mare for health/ safety standards, as no room to move, or exit Is chaos, attempting to enter or exit, due to employees, customers, people hanging waiting, is a nightmare. Loud noisy disjointed near front entrance. What needs to be said? A lousy over priced chain restaurant, with so-so quality food, without much seasoning  flavor or freshness!  Maybe dinner does not include soup or salad, and this is a give away, as it is not a BISTRO! Basket of bread  & is really gluten laden, and poor quality bread! There is nothing relaxing, enjoyable, or attractive going to this over rated place. Food leaves much to be desired. Not 140 degrees when arrives at table as required! Per my digital therm tester.

Nathan M.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,12,1,2.0,4/17/2016,"I'm not exactly sure why I am even giving this two stars, maybe from prior experiences?  Well... There was an hour wait, which I guess would be normal for a Sunday night but I have never waited more than about 20 minutes here, ever!  So it's my birthday and Mother in Law wanted to take me out, so I suggested the usual Cheesecake Factory as I do every year!  So after the horrendous wait, we get seated and told the ""specials"" from the server filling in for the normal server.  I order the salmon special and my husband and mom order their meals.  About ten minutes in and the lights dimmed so much we are all amused at the fact that we can barely see each other and the table next to us is passing around a cell phone with their flashlight on to read the menu.  I'm now told from the normal server that she is so sorry but they are out of salmon!  So I ask to see the menu again and quickly decide on a pasta from the heading because at this point I can't read what is under it due to the lighting.... I ask her what is a good past with a white sauce that I can take out the meat?  So I decide on Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic... And please hold the chicken. Totally put on pressure to pick something else quickly. Now I don't eat meat but I do eat fish, so I ask to hold the chicken.  I get my meal and start eating.  What am I chewing on cause I can't see my food? I put my flashlight on and it's covered in pancetta.  Apparently in small print there's pancetta.  I waive down the server and she apologizes that she did not think to ask if pancetta would be okay when I asked to hold the chicken.  (Assuming someone would be vegetarian when asking to hold meat).  So okay my fault, she takes it back to be remade without meat.  I get my new meal. IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME! Covered in meat again! The server apologizes over and over and sends for another meal. By this time my husband and mom are finished eating and waiting on me.  We have now been there about two and a half hours.  I've picked at the bread and spinach dip enough that I'm now full.  So we ask for boxes and a check.  Come to find.... We were charged for my meal!  Seriously?  I'm so disappointed in my ""birthday"" experience that no one even feels like challenging the check.  But really... Your going to charge me for that!?!

Char J.,"Long Beach, CA",6,67,2,3.0,3/19/2014,"If you only knew how much I crave Cheese Cake Factory, you would think I'd give it a 5 star rating but...not.   Once upon a time it was a pleasure to dine here but I just don't feel that way anymore.  Outside dining seating has been reduced to cafeteria style setups and you are literally sitting with strangers that cannot hold a intimate conversation unless you speak in alien code.  I can actually smell what's on the other guest plates and hear them chew and swallow.  (I don't know you like that)  I am so sick of valeting my car.  If I'm going pay for something, I'd rather it be park and ride not someone else to park my car where I am very well capable of parking my car.  Sometimes we go late and when dinner is done it should be time to go not time to wait again for my car.  It's really not as convenient as they may assume it to be.  The consideration that we take into account is, can we stand the wait.  Which is usually 25-60min. on average.  Do I really feel like dealing with the crowded reception booth that everyone stands around like they have the winning lotto.   The food is good and I absolutely come here solely for some outside dining and the Cajun Jambalaya which I find to be a grand cheat meal.  The flavors in it are awesome. I came here for my birthday once and the waiter just brought out this tiny sample cup of ice cream...that's it but another table got a birthday song and a slice of cheesecake.  : - O The wait staff are a crap shoot.  Some people are great at what they do and some just need  a job (I get it).  I tip accordingly so, when your service surprises me, I surprise you but when I'm asking myself questions like, ""did that just happen"", I'm checking off.  I have a problem with people that lack people skills, working in the service industry.  Even though I come here for the food and the ambiance there are some things that get in the way of that fulfilling experience of dining out. I gave two stars for the ambiance alone.  Some days its nice to spend a couple hours on the bike path and then head over to CCF afterward. The bar seating is a bit crowded but not overwhelming and the TVs are kind of high on the wall and there is no sound when watching the game.  Not ideal but if you find yourself there, it's doable if you don't want to miss a particular game.   Biggest Con:  That tiny ass bathroom that always need a tiding up.  Two stalls? TH Sometimes I just hold it.   The last few times we have ordered our food to go on our way there because they expect a tip if you order from your car and they bring it out.  Naaaay, I can walk in a pay, no problem.  They always forget your condiments even when you ask for them in advance like, bread no butter and sometimes utensil.  They'll double check your food order but it's up to you to make sure you have the extras you requested. Overall: I will still come here from time to time but 9-10 it will be for take out on a cheat day.  They are not the worst",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=500

The waiter came by the table only once outside of taking our order and giving us the check. I was not given a refill the entire two hours we spent waiting for our food. The restaurant forgot part if our order but since the waiter was absent for the entire duration of our meal, there was nobody to tell about this. When the check finally rolled around, we were able to tell the waiter that they forgot part of our meal. He tried to weasel out of it and say that he could bring it back out to us, but by that time we were all finished eating and had no desire to stay any longer in the frigid conditions that we were placed in. He refused to remove the part that he forgot from the check and had to call his manager, whom which offered a measly piece of cheesecake as compensation. When we got the piece of cheesecake it was visually tampered with (i.e. somebody licked it), but by this time we just decided to cut our losses and leave that place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=540

There is always a huge crowd in the lobby area.  People LOVE this place right?!!!  We were seated immediately but that was when it got fun. If you know this place then allow me to guide you to the inside dining area, where there is this two-top table pushed up against the wall and positioned about 12 inches from a real table, a 4-top.  This table setting seems like an after thought, as if the manager said lets up our sales and squeeze a table into this space.  We asked to be seated elsewhere, to not be made to feel like a step child that  is amongst the favorite children people.  We were seated at the other side of the inside dining area.  And there we sat.   And sat.  And sat.  And sat.  The servers walked by us.  Every single one of them.  And you know how many people walk by the homeless and don't make eye contact?  Don't acknowledge their presence?  Yep, that was us.   Then finally Brittaney/Elizabeth, I can't remember who, gently walked up to our table and whispered if we had been helped.  No.  And she did.  Yay!  We were enjoying our complimentary bread, again, yay and then the appetizer of Spinach Dip came out.  Cold.  It's okay if it's a cold app but when there's cheese involved, the app should be served warm, very warm.  But we endured because as a step child we didn't want to get too loud. Then, dum-dum-dum!  The manager walks up and politely asks if we could move because we were seated at a reserved table.  There was no reserved sign but whatever. We moved to the booth a few feet away and enjoyed our meal.  I had the Jambalaya and it was great but honestly I got full with the app and bread. As usual it's the CCF.  They're gonna serve the same stuff, the same way, every time.  And that's ok.  It's comfort food.  And besides, the company was quite wonderful, so what was there to complain about???

Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4475,2217,19024,5.0,9/6/2010,"The Marina del Rey Cheesecake Factory is by far my favorite location of this restaurant chain.  Just about everyone has enjoyed the Factory's high-calorie, high-taste cheesecakes and huge menu selection.  Most may not know this, but CF was the first true ""date"" (in Pasadena) my wife and I shared (she picked it because it seemed the best ""American"" place) so it has a little extra meaning for us.   The menu was recently updated. Today for lunch, we tried one new item and one tried-n-true dish.   The Farmhouse Burger is new. I guess it replaced the old Ranch House Burger (an old fave). The good news is that the Farmhouse one is $2 cheaper, very unique, and also very good.  It's an Angus Beef patty covered with Grilled Smoked Pork Belly, Cheddar Cheese, White Onions, Iceberg Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo, and a Fried Egg.  That's right: Grilled Pork Belly and a Fried Egg?!?!   The egg is a runny Sunny-side Up that oozes all over the burger once you begin to eat it.  Because of the egg, this burger won't be for everyone, but it sure was an amazing combination of flavors in one very messy burger.  The burger comes with fries, but for $1 extra we upgraded to the delicious Sweet Potato Fries.  My only recommendation for this burger would be to upgrade the lettuce as it seemed to add nothing.  Romaine or possibly spinach would be better.  But I digress.  For me, the Farmhouse Burger is another win for Cheesecake Factory.  Check out the picture uploaded with this review to see it. My wife went with her favorite CF dish:  Miso Salmon with Snow Peas and White Rice.  Even the lunch special at $7 off was almost too big to eat.  It's a classic sweet teriyaki-ish sauce on the grilled salmon that brings  back memories of happy summer days in Tokyo. For an appetizer, we tried something new (for us) that isn't quite new at all:  Stuffed Mushrooms.  They were tasty, however, seemed a little overcooked by about 30-45 seconds leaving a slightly charred taste on the tender mushrooms.  They are stuffed with Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic, and Herbs served with a Wine Sauce.  The mixture of cheese and wine sauce was loved by my wife who enjoyed dipping the sourdough bread in it. Service was great as the hostess seated us quickly and then moved us from our original seat to a better one on the upper outdoor balcony with a great view of Mother's Beach when we requested some shade under an umbrella. Our waiter was a bit slow at first because the place is seriously busy, but he warmed up to us as the meal progressed and even gave us two To-Go Cups of our drinks: Passion Fruit Iced Tea and an Arnold Palmer. The Arnold Palmer is served in a regular tea glass rimmed with sugar (like Margarita salt, but sweet). It is a nice (and very sweet) touch. Valet parking is always $5, so we took the Water Bus over from Fisherman's Village for $1 each way and enjoyed the ride through the Marina. If you want to avoid valet, there is a lot nearby that offers self-pay spots. In addition to the previously mentioned food, my recommendations for any Cheesecake Factory remain the same:  Buffalo Blasts, Avocado Eggrolls, BLT Salad, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, and the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club. Finally, we got a slice of cheesecake to go.  It was a dilemma choosing between the 1200-calorie Red Velvet or the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream. We went the Tuxedo route with layers of Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mousse, and Chocolate. Of course, it was delicious. With its nice view, full bar, great selection of tasty specialties, and stellar service, the Cheesecake Factory of Marina del Rey stands out as an excellent dining option if you can afford the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=540

She says ""give us a few moments to clean the table."" Fine. ONE minute later we return to go to our seats and lo' and behold, the seats are rearranged. Umm...we ask her what happened, she apologizes and attempts to change it back. Great. Then the ""manager"" named Steven comes and stops her saying these tables can't be rearranged. WHAT??? We were just given the table a minute ago, what do you mean it can't be rearranged?! Of course, Mr. Manager gets frustrated and starts giving us a harder time. Our guests arrive to a scene where we are arguing with Steven. Because we didn't want to cause a bigger scene in front of our guests, we say fine give us another table. He says sure, the folks over then are almost done and I will seat you there. Great. ONE HOUR passes. Nothing. No seats. No food. No drinks. I go up to the manager while our guests were talking. (I rarely get mad) I reached my boiling point with him. He finally seats us. Seats sucked as much as the first ones. Ugh. At this point, we are starving. Screw the messed up seats.

Elizabeth R.,"Bakersfield, CA",68,59,61,3.0,3/24/2013,"Never thought I'd give The Cheesecake Factory a less than 5 star review, but here we are. When my sister and I were leaving Venice Beach with my niece and little brother in tow, we decided to stop by Cheese Factory because we don't have one near us, so we figured, ""Eh, it's on our way home, why not?"" When we got there, we were super hungry, tired from walking around, and looking forward to just sitting, relaxing and having super good food. When we got there, it was valet parking. I've never experienced valet parking at all-let alone at a Cheesecake Factory, although I'm aware it's fancy enough to merit one. Whatever, we're hungry, it's only $5, we pay it.  We get inside, the person taking names and handing out those little buzzers that go off to let you know you can get seated isn't very attentive. In fact, it looks like she doesn't want to be there. She's more concerned with primping. There's another girl standing right next to her who is kind enough to ask us how many in our party, and that triggers the other girl behind the computer to ask my name, tells me it will be a 30 minute wait, and hand me a buzzer. Why they need two girls up front to split that task is beyond me, but at least one of them was pleasant. We finally get seated and our server is so nice! She's on task about giving us refills, asking us if we need anything else, etc. So that was one good part about our meal. I ordered the chicken marsala, and my sister ordered the lemon herb chicken to share with my niece. My little brother ordered the kid's pizza. I've had the chicken marsala at at the Irvine location, and I very much preferred Irvine's. It was juicier, more flavorful and the pasta was al dente. The pasta at the Marina Del Rey locaiton was bowtie, and pretty darn undercooked. Not even al dente. More like, it was 2 minutes away from being al dente.  Unfortunately did not have any cheesecake with our meal because we didn't have any room (the portions are HUGE) and we didn't want to trek back in the car with perishables. It's a shame, their red velvet is amazing and now I'm craving a slice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=560

Clayton C.,"Dallas, TX",21,158,17,3.0,7/29/2014,"Let me preface this review by saying that I don't like The Cheesecake Factory, and we only went because we had a $50 gift card and two gift cards for a free slice of cheesecake each.  It turned out at the end of the night that we only had $17 left on the gift card, and the free cheesecakes expired in 2012.  Oops. The food is good.  It's not splendid, and I can't imagine it's healthy, but it's good.  The bread is delicious.  The service was good.  I just felt terrible at the end of the night that I was spending $80 (plus tip) on fairly plain food, and then walked outside to pay $4.50 (plus tip) in a mandatory valet lot. We ordered a lot of food (thinking at the time that we had a lot of free money to spend. Oops.).  Here's what we had: - Ahi tuna tartare (pretty good, but pretty small for $6.95) - Chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps (nothing special, and as with all lettuce wrap dishes ever, too much lettuce, not enough filling) - Steak salad (probably has a better name, but that's what it is - should have guessed that it would be swimming in dressing) - Lemon garlic shrimp (the shrimp were big, but the best thing my wife can say is ""there was nothing wrong with it"", which means that she can make it better) - Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic (the best dish of the night - quite tasty, but still probably fairly unhealthy) - Kahlua cheesecake (I've never seen it offered anywhere else, so it's definitely unique, but I'd love to have more flavor) - White chocolate raspberry cheesecake (they didn't have the chocolate raspberry, which was literally the only thing we were looking forward to - this one is an ok back-up, but just ok) So yeah, it's a lot of food.  Don't worry, we didn't eat it all in one sitting.  But in my mind, despite the good service, and the ok food, it's way too expensive for just ok food, especially in the food mecca that is Los Angeles.  And please, please, if valet is mandatory, don't make it $4.50.

erin w.,"Chicago, IL",6,9,2,1.0,6/26/2016,"Last night was probably the most horrific experience that I have ever had at this restaurant. After getting done enjoying my dinner and getting ready to leave I was in a panic when I discovered that my purse was missing. I literally placed it hanging on my chair while sitting there enjoying my dinner. I did not leave the table once and yet my purse was still snachted from me. The only people walking by our table was the staff members. Our server was as helpful as she could be. I was extremely upset that this could happen. Fortunately, I was able to use the track my iPhone app on my boyfriends phone. Which showed that it was in the restaurant.  I was walking around the restaurant for about an hour and half. When I stated to one of the managers that it was located in the restaurant he was very uninterested.  I also asked if there was a higher manager then him which he informed there wasn't. That wasn't the truth at all I found out shortly later. I requested the manager to call the local police authority which he did not. This mangager was refusing to be helpful in this whole situation.  Then the general manager Steven came over to talk to us he was more then helpful. He actually walked around for about 30 mins with us trying to track my phone that was located in my missing purse. And what do you know all of sudden it was turned in. I couldn't believe it. I was happy when my server found it and brought it back to me. But after all that someone finally turned it in. But of course all the cash that was in my purse was gone. I had about $60-70 cash in it. I can't help but think an employee finally decided to turn it after they took the cash out. I really think one of the employees at the restaurant actually stole my purse and took the cash. They must have gotten nervous when I asked for the police to be contacted. I can't believe after such an awful experience that my dinner was not refunded. I am completely appalled by this whole situation. I can no longer continue to be a paying patron here. I feel completely taken advantage of after being ripped off by an employee. The whole situation was just a shady experience. I was a regular customer that would attend here at least twice a month. I will no longer continue to do business with the restaurant. I have never felt more taken advantage of. I would have liked to watch the security camera myself.

I told him it was ok and he wouldn't have it. He took our order and got us our drinks very promptly. After we had our drinks our actual waiter came by and asked if we were ready to order, I politely told him not from him especially after 46 minutes at the table. I asked Dominic to continue to take care of us which he did and he did a great job apologizing at every opportunity. I told him the fact he was watching our table and others means he has a eye for customer service!  I saw others around us being served and am not sure what happened with our server but it is what it is. But Dominic did the most kind hearted thing and didn't throw his coworker under the bus and showed he would take one for the team by engaging us and helping us through the problem.

Shannon C.,"Albuquerque, NM",801,647,1222,1.0,1/24/2017,"NO! I had a VERY STRANGE experience here. The wait was normal (45 minutes or so on a weekend) and 4 of us were seated on the patio. 20 minutes later with no server, I asked a busboy who our server was supposed to be. His personal conversation with another busboy couldn't be interrupted. I went inside to the hostess desk and she said she'll send a waiter out. The waiter arrived and we ordered a bottle of wine. 20 minutes later he drops off the bottle of wine, unopened, and without glasses, and leaves. We flag down another waiter for glasses, a request he doesn't understand because at this point he thinks we brought our own bottle. We have this second waiter just take the unopened bottle of wine away. Original waiter returns and 3 out of 4 of us order before he wanders off after asking my mother how she wants her side salad cooked. He was completely non-verbal beyond this bizarre question. I was actually wondering if he was having a medical emergency. 3 entrees arrive extraordinarily quickly (like 6 minutes after ordering!), dropped off by the manager. He asked how our evening was going, to which I replied ""Kinda the worst!"" I explain to him that 1. we waited forever at our table and had to ask multiple times for a waiter, 2. we didn't receive water or a bread basket like the tables around us (who had different waiters), 3. that a bottle of wine was dropped off without being opened and without glasses (to which he said ""what bottle?"" and looks around), and that 4. one of us was skipped during ordering. The manager goes to the hostess area, comes back and informs us that we've only been there ""50 minutes."" Completely irrelevant, and also a lie. I show him 1 hour 9 minutes on my timer. He never apologizes, but mutters about how maybe all the glasses were dirty and they need to do dishes. At this point he realized that I don't have food, and nobody has drinks, and insists, condescendingly, ""Honey, let me bring you some food. I don't want you to starve."" I left and had great cocktails & dinner at Settebello Pizzeria. (Note: This review is from December 2015 and was hanging out in my drafts.

Jacklyn G.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,35,13,1.0,11/24/2017,"As a party of 10, we arrived Wednesday night, roughly at 630p. I'm not sure the time frame we were quoted as I was apart of the second car for our party that arrived later. We waited for over an hour to be seated while basically everyone that walked passed us, where all seated right away. It was very busy, so we waited.  While waiting, my niece was sitting on the furthest bench to the parking lot outside, also in the spot of the bench closest to the parking lot, and in a white Lexus, valet almost hit her while backing it up directly in front of the restaurant! She didn't move, but it wasn't until her Dad tapped on the window did the car stop moving. Not exaggerating, the car was 4-5 inches from her. Possibly closer.  While waiting, my husband ordered a glass of wine & a beer at the bar, which took very long to receive.  Finally we're seated. Summer was our server. After 5 or so minutes, she approaches us to tell us that she'll be with us in a moment. She comes back where we're all ready to order, waters for everyone except 3 kids drinks, and we ordered our food at that time as well. Bread hits the table- breads get devoured since there were lots of hungry people at the table- my daughter was crying that she was thirsty, I waited and waited and waited for our drinks, finally I got up and walked to the server station to get a water for my child.. a few moments later, water finally arrives. The food took a very, verrryy long time. The waters were never refilled even though we requested it, one child didn't receive her juice until we were all finished eating, and we were never checked on during the course of our meal either. No additional alcohol or dessert was ordered because we were sure we wouldn't get it anywhere near on time. By the time we saw Summer again, we needed boxes and our check and one person needed to place a to go order. ""What do you want?"", Summer asked him. Straight to the point and not in the friendly way.  Overall our server seemed overwhelmed & frustrated, which is totally fine, as long as you're able to keep it positive, explain that things are taking a few extra moments, and keep in touch with your guests. Instead we were totally ignored and spent a lot of money, really, for less than mediocre service.  1 star goes to the ONE gentleman wearing a purple button down, most likely a FOH Manager, who was genuinely friendly when he brought out our food and smiled and greeted us when we walked past him to our table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=40

Both spicy cashew chicken plates were extremely salty it was inedible. The medium well cheeseburger that I got came rare!

We then proceeded to wait by the to go counter for at least 20 minutes for 2 slices of cheesecake to be placed in plastic containers. This gave me time to observe the operation and why it is going wrong and become rather unimpressed. There was a single person slicing and plating all of the orders in a busy restaurant that specialises in cheesecake.  This poor fellow had to do each order and traverse behind a long counter for no apparent reason walking around the other staff in this narrow space to set the orders  in place for the servers. We even saw him have to leave and go to a store room for supplies. Has someone running this place with an analytical mind has ever stood in this operation and watched what was going on? Maybe it would not be an insane idea to make this big enough for the staff to work and have more people there so the customers could get their food? Its just hard to watch. We were here sitting down once before for cheesecake and the wait was bad then too. The good: nice patio and pretty building. Cheesecake is good if over sweetened.

I said this is oil and you must change it so he takes the food and comes back in 2 minutes and tells me that they took out the oil but it was still so so oily , I told him I wasn't stupid and asked him to make a new one without oil. so with an angry tone of voice he goes : OK. He comes back after 10 minutes with a new dish, anyhow we waisted a lot of time there and it was so upsetting. finally the waiter brings the bill and tells me they took care of my dish and I won't have to pay! so I look at the bill and see that my dish is charged twice and taken out once !!!!!!!! ????? They really think everyone is dumb ! I called the waiter and he goes oh sorry let me tell the manager so he leaves and comes back in 5 minutes telling me that they didn't charge me for the new one but I have to play for one! I was so furious and my guest was so upset that I said lat me just pay and get the hell out of this horrible place. Their food is so expensive and you still don't get what you order and you still have to pay. Cheesecake Factory marina del rey is a horrible place and I don't recommend it to anybody.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=600

Rey L.,"El Segundo, CA",119,851,1991,5.0,7/24/2012,"weird. i didn't realize i hadn't reviewed this place yet. go figure. eaten here 1,041 times before and i guess i never thought to review. this is our favorite CF. it used to be down the street from our old house. parking is valet only, but, not too bad at $3.50 for lunch and $4.50 for dinner. table seating is quick and painless, even if you want to sit outside. we've never had to wait more than 10mins even on a busy summer sunday afternoon to get patio seats. staff have always been pleasant and food has always been consistently good. obviously, we've got our faves. granted they're mass produced made to order food, it's still delicious. my picks are the asian beef strip thing, the basic burger and the chicken salad. i love their lunch specials that come with soup/salad combos. this particular spot is right next to a man-made beach, ironically called Mother's Beach. lots and lots of kiddies enjoy this little stretch of sand and water located just at the edge of the boats. there is also a kids play area with slides, swings and jungle gym stuff just a few feet from the water. it's a great view from the seats at CF and a great way to work off some of that complimentary bread you didn't have to finish. :) we just recently discovered the beachside patio seating. easier access to the beach, but, with a limited menu. and by limited, i mean only their top 100 items are on this menu. snap. great spot to come out to on a summer day. we'll keep coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=600

Bethany K.,"Orange County, CA",102,597,106,4.0,1/12/2013,"My husband LOVE LOVE LOVES the Cheesecake Factory... probably partially because of the whole NBA-players-love-it phenomenon (Google it!).  You probably already know about the gigantic menu and often good service, huge portions, etc, so I'll just get to it. LOGISTICS *We used to go to the Brentwood location... until it closed. *SOB* *Unavoidable valet parking for $5... I was super tempted to drive around to find an alternative, but whatevs. It was cold. *Curbside to go is a great option! Review the hugeo menu online, call in your fav, you don't get to eat as much bread (which could be a good thing...) and you just call when you get there and they bring it out for you with the bill. They run in to ring up your card (who uses cash nowadays?) and off you go! No wait, designated parking spots, and you also get to avoid the $5 parking... win win. *I've never known a Cheesecake Factory to not have an annoyingly long wait during anything remotely close to ""peak hours."" Dinner at 9pm on a Friday, thankfully, is not considered ""peak hours"" :) *Have not yet enjoyed the view----I guess that's why people suck up the $5!  FOOD *I would rather get half as much food... but it is what it is. Share items, if you can agree on what to order (ha) or ask for a To Go box early so you don't accidentally-I-mean-uh eat everything! *Thank you, fellow reviewers, for mentioning the Avocado Egg Rolls ($10)--they were GREAT. You get 6 decent sized eggrolls (or I guess it's technically 3, cut into halves) with a BOMB sauce. I think they're vegetarian... but didn't ask. *One of my FAVORITE hidden gems: KALE SALAD! It's on the ""Small Plates and Snacks"" page -- not on the Salad... or Side Salad... or Entree Salad sections. Kale salad. $5.95 (!) and a decent size--with the bread and an appetizer or dessert or bites of other people's food, it's definitely enough for an entree. I think it has... apples... and almonds? and... other yummy things. Simple, but tasty... and honestly, the Cheesecake Factory is not known for it's *simplicity* lol. The dressing (which is delish) is not vegan but it's a pepper-y buttermilk and I remember it (pre-vegan days) being delish! HIDDEN GEM. *Some of my other favorites (pre-vegan): Miso Salmon (loved this so much I obsessively Google'd for the recipe and tried replicating at home more than once), Garlic Noodles, and the Strawberry Shortcake dessert! I'm not the biggest fan of cheesecake (irony of ironies) but LOVE their Strawberry Shortcake... biscuitybready shortcake, vanilla ice cream, and lots of strawberries. *bliss* Anyway, we'll obviously be at the Cheesecake Factory more than I could hope or ask for, but it's consistent and the selection is great so it is what it is. I would give it 3 stars for the stupid $5 parking and how they're so obviously contributing to part of why Americans over-eat (lol semi-serious) but whatever--it is what it is! And so much of what they have is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=600
Travis I.,"Culver City, CA",1102,473,2443,5.0,3/3/2010,"- Huge Menu ((Like, epically large. Jerry's Famous Deli on crack.)) - Friendly waitstaff. - Equal-opportunity bread service. ((Brown and white chillin' in the same basket... I like that.)) - Lotsa sneaky places to park off-site, so you don't have to let some dude park your car and charge you for it.  - Nice patio overlooking the little inland beach. ((Heat lamps included, for those nippley nights.)) - Booze city. - And yes, as I'm easy to please: FREE REFILLS. Some restaurants are SUCH pricks about this, and I don't get it. If a restaurant charges over $10 for a dish of food, the sodas should come rolling out. If I can score free refills at McDonalds for $1.39, then I shouldn't have to deal with shelling out $5 per coke at a place that's already taking my $12 for a plate of chicken tenders.  ((deep breath)) Okay... settling down. Kind of a pet peeve. This spot in particular, next to the Marina's endless lines of boats, has always served up the fantastic eats. A little pricey at first glance and then you get your order... and holy sh!t, the portions are gar-gantuan. Worry not. Your entree is enough to satiate you; you needn't order an appetizer, if the budget's tight. That being said, another way to go is to order a couple of appetizers instead of ordering an entree. This is both cost-effective and provides you with some variety, instead of leftovers.  It's truly rare that I find myself at a restaurant in which I'm stumped, as far as menu options. The entire Cheesecake Factory menu is appealing. It's a gift... It's a curse. Because you want EVERYTHING, it sometimes makes it hard to order, but at the same time, at least everything is good. My poor friend had to deal with my indecision during recent visit; how do you decide which ONE to get when seventy five different things are beckoning.  The bottom line: It's all about taste preferences. This is like a TGIF that learned to turn up the quality and diversity of their food a few notches. Yet another restaurant at which you don't have to ask, ""What's good?"" The answer is: ""What SOUNDS good? Because everything is good, so if it sounds good, it IS good.""  In my humble opinion, don't waste your time with conventional fare, here. ((I'm being a hypocrite, as I order things like Cesar salads here, all the time)) But be a better person than me! Order some crazy stuff. Ideas? Why sure... **APPS - Fried Mac-n-Cheese balls - Calamari (Thanks to Tara C. and Trishy B. for the suggestion) - Avocado Eggrolls - Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll **ENTREES - Stuffed Chicken Tortillas - Spicy Crispy Beef ((Yes, Chinese.. And it's one of my FAVES!)) - Chicken Romano ((Pounded Chix breast crusted with parm cheese)) - Shockingly, the Teriyaki Chicken. ((Don't hate me, fellow hapas)) - Chicken Parmesan Sandwich BIGGEST TRIP: Alcoholic Milkshakes. Oh yeah. I've had 'em. Order an extra shot of your favorite booze on the side; the shakes can be a bit weak as far as booze per volume goes.  They seem to have a new variety of pizzas that I've yet to try... Can anyone say, ""Time for a CF DYL Event!"" ?? 5 big fat stars.

Brian S.,"Winnetka, CA",0,586,137,4.0,1/31/2011,"As with all of the other Cheesecake Factory locations that I've visited, this one put in an admirable performance. Food was good and service was solid. Wait time for an indoor table was not too long (30 minutes). Portions are mostly big and I'd guess that 80% or more of the diners were taking doggy bags with them. Plus, the food is good enough to actually eat it the next day!  I'm a real picky patron and will comment in the negative on two things. First, I detest being forced to valet park and pay $5. The reason I say that is because the fixed price is $4.50 but the valet had no intention of giving change.  I also wish they would get under control is the way their ""car hop"" waiters exit the building. I like their appearance and the way they were speedy in delivering to the waiting customers, but each one of them SMASHED the exit bar on the door... which was unlocked and there was no need to even push the exit bar to open the door. It is a very loud and disturbing noise to keep hearing for the people waiting for a table or sitting in the bar.  Other than that, it is a crowded and noisy dining room, but one that gives a real sense of fun and being a ""happening place"".  Next time I'll have to save room for some cheesecake... but I say that every time and it only happens at lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=600

(mumbling to self must be that Swedish blood of his =/ So as I was saying we went on Monday night had a rather nice dinner our standard Chicken thai Lettuce Wraps which are always the BOMB those 3 sauces are yummy. I had a Irish Nut (humph! trying to warm my brown arse up!) Thomas Jefferson had a wonderful concoction called ""The Blackjack"" as TJ nickname is ""Midnight"" we thought this apro pos :) it was good.

Nice view of the Marina and they have plenty of heaters outside.  On the second night the service SUCKED! I ordered the Wild Mushroom soup which was okay and TJ got the Eggplant Sandwich which turned out to be delicious but BLOODY HELL we waited for (what felt like) a half an hour outside in the misting dew while I counted no more than 10 tables occupied in the whole restaurant. Okay and why was there like 20 servers on that night.... it was late after 9:00pm hmmm something that my food & beverage manager/mind wonders about from time to time. Anyhoo when our server returned to us we just told her to wrap it up and we'd take it home... no need to continue to freeze AND be hungry LOL ps.

There's a huge selection of food & drink so you're bound to find something you will like. I'm basing this rating on a recent phone call to the restaurant. I called to make a reservation for 12 people for lunch on a Friday. After taking all my information, the woman said she had to confirm with the manager that it was ok to take the reservation. So then she comes back to me and said the manager said that they only take group lunch reservations from Mon-Thurs. I know that my same work group has eaten with a reservation for that many people on a Friday so this must be a new policy. Her alternative solution was to come a half an hour early and wait for a table. Well, the whole point of not waiting when you have a big party like that is why we make a reservation.

Outside they have way too many heaters so unless you are really freezing sit inside in the winter or spring because it is warmer outside.  Service is usually pretty bad as we always see be waiters and the hostesses are usually snappy and rude. They should be used to high volumes of people not happy about 45 minute waits for okay food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=640
Barry B.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,20,,4.0,5/4/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants, because i like everything i've tried from their menu.  I also like the ambiance and beach view.  Plus it's close by me. :) I've tried a few items from the menu, but my all time favorite is the ""Miso Salmon"" and this review is for that.  I love seafood and i normally get fried shrimp or crab legs when i go have seafood at restaurants known for their seafood.  Of course Cheesecake Factory doesn't sell crab legs. :(  So therefore I decided to try the Miso Salmon here on a visit a while back and i'm now addicted to it....and can't seem to bring myself to move on to something else on the menu.  The miso glaze gives the salmon a nice semi-sweet taste, but definitely not over bearing.  I would actually recommend this dish to anyone who wants to give seafood a try, and not worry about it tasting fishy. Oh....and if you like Carrot cake, you have to try it here.  Other than the Palm restaurant, i would rate their Carrot cake as my favorite.  My least favorite thing about this location is the tight parking spots the valet guys have to fit your car into.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=640
Lori R.,"San Pedro, CA",123,20,,2.0,3/1/2013,"It pains me to write this review. My husband and I had our first date here 16 years ago and try to get back every year or so on that anniversary. We've always loved the food, although every time we go they've removed another item we like from the menu. There is now only one item left of our favorites. Because there always such a long wait for a table, we arrived mid-afternoon, hoping they would be less crouded. It was. We walked right in, only to find the hostess station un-manned. We waited a few minutes but no one showed up. We looked to the bakery immediately behind us hoping to ask for help there, but it was un-manned as well. After about 10 minutes someone showed up and we were seated. As the hostess sat us down, she explained that we might have a longer than normal wait, as the waitress was busy. I looked around the dining room and realized that all the patrons were seated together in one section. This made me wonder if they were short staffed. A great way to start our anniversary meal. Service was indeed slow. While ordering, I asked about one dish - herb encrusted salmon. Our waitress described it to me and I ordered it. When it came, it was far from the menu description or what the server told me. I didn't want to make my husband wait so I didn't send it back, but it was disappointing. Then, with our cheesecake, I wanted a cappachino. I asked our server if it was strong or whether I should add a shot of espresso to make it that way. She assured me it was very strong and only Italian men needed the extra shot. The coffee arrived so weak it looked like a few spoonfuls of coffee added to a glass of milk. Worse, it was barely lukewarm. I tried to get her attention before she walked away, but could not. It took quite awhile to get the attention of ANY server. We waited quite awhile for the replacement coffee, which wasn't much better. I didn't send it back, because we were waiting to eat our dessert. Even though they knew I was unhappy with the coffee twice, they did not offer to take it off our bill.  They have some good items on the menu, but the poor service just isn't worth it any more. As we got it the car, my husband looked to me and said, ""I guess we'll have to find another place to celebrate this anniversary starting next year.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=700

Diana C.,"Culver City, CA",133,36,,5.0,7/25/2011,"I suppose you can call me somewhat of a Cheesecake Factory connoisseur. I have been coming here for years and I love it! It was actually my new year's resolution one year to try every single cheesecake they had and what do you know, it was the only new year's resolution I have ever kept! My favorite cheesecake, white chocolate caramel latte, was actually gotten rid of, so my new favorites are pumpkin pecan, red velvet, or the tuxedo. You really can't go wrong with any cheesecake though, or any of their other cakes. (I love the Chocolate Truffle Cake the most) The food there rarely lets me down too. I've had most of their appetizers and my top picks are the fried macncheese balls, the avocado rolls, the spinach and cheese dip, the buffalo blasts, or the firecracker salmon rolls. Out of their pastas, I love the four-cheese pasta, the carbonara, or the farfalle with chicken and garlic. Their salads are amazing too, I usually never order salads when I go out because I never feel like its really that satisfying, but at the cheesecake factory, they are tasty enough as a meal and definitely fill me up, especially the BBQ chicken or the luau salad. Their burgers are always a solid choice too. The only things I've gotten there that I wouldnt get again are the fish and chips, which I thought were bland, and the belgium waffle, which was just like any other belgium waffle.  Anddd of course, I can't forget about the amazing bread they start you off with! Lets just say its a struggle for me to not fill up on the bread :P I love how the taste (and portions) of the dishes are the same at every Cheesecake factory. It never fails me. The only downside is that I'm practically holding my stomach in pain and can barely stand up after a meal here. And I'm probably swiping a few days off my life with all the calories i'm inhaling... oh well! Its definitely worth it!!! =]",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=700

Not amazing. But good. Service has also always been very decent.  But at this location, it's not really about the food - it's about the outside patio. The patio is a lovely spot to have lunch. Beautiful view of the marina, and when you're sitting outside, it doesn't feel like you are dining at a large chain restaurant.  On colder days they have heaters, and on the hotter days, they have umbrellas, so the temperature is usually pretty great. Seating is a little tight (they really use up all the space possible) so be ready to squeeze around tables. Take your mom here for lunch and buy her one of those adult pink lemonades.

Jon N.,"Valparaiso, IN",372,207,2,3.0,11/14/2011,"Here's the deal with the Cheesecake Factory... this is true not just of the Marina restaurant but also the ones in Brea or Pasadena as well. There are some items on the menu that I really like! Some of my favorites are the Pasta Jambalaya, Memphis Burger, and the Chicken Madeira. With places like the Cheesecake Factory, once you find something you like I guess you keep ordering it. I'm sorry but some things on the menu don't sound good at all. Like all chains they keep weeding out those items that don't sell.  Our favorite cheesecake quickly became our least favorite cheesecake once they changed the recipe. We used to order the carmel cheesecake all the time until they changed it for some reason. Now we order the red velvet cheesecake. Simply to die for. Literally to die for because it's so full of calories and other stuff that clogs arteries and cuts down on life span. We have to split it. Oh well, that's the price one has to pay if one wants to splurge a bit.  I usually find the atmosphere and the service pretty good.

I got the herb crusted salmon which like a typical salmon dish and my date got a filet mignon (it was ok also).

Slade B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,30,22,3.0,10/18/2013,"Picked up a friend for dinner who recently moved to the area to be closer to his work at LAX. Upon arrival, we were forced to valet park, $4.50 charge. The attendant said self park or valet, you still have to pay the fee. Ripoff.  The dining room was a little crowded so, we decided to self seat in the bar area. Our server arrived promptly to take our drink order and asked about an appetizer before we even opened our menus. I love quick service but, we felt rushed.  We passed on a appetizer because my bud is doing the whole P90X thing so, he's watching his food intake. We ordered our entrees and they arrived quickly. Before we even took our first bite, the server was there like flies on dung, asking how everything turned out. I really didn't have an answer for her, being that my fork was still wrapped in my napkin. I had the orange chicken with brown rice. The chicken alone was delicious. The rice was dry, I had to ask for soy sauce to rehydrate it. Which was a task to get because the server walked passed us about 4 times before I finally grabbed her eye. My bud had the turkey and avocado sandwich, not a crumb was left on his plate so, I'm assuming he liked it. Our server didn't hover, which I appreciate but, after she dropped the check, she was never seen again. I had to walk up to the bar top to have her run our payments. So our experience was meh.

We got a Pomegranate Mojito, and a Long Island Ice Tea (top shelf only $1 more). We also got a plate of bread to hold us over until we decided on what to eat. After much thought and consideration (from the gigantic menu) I went with the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich with fries and coleslaw, which i had Mashed Potatoes substituted in for (which were just the way i love it, chunky with skins, and red potatoes), and she got Chicken Avocado Club Sandwich. The bbq pulled pork was perfect, tender and thick and the bbq sauce was good. The chicken avocado was HUGE and very tasty. We initially only came for the half price cheesecake so we only ate half our meals and boxed the rest to go. Next came the cheesecake... ohhh the cheesecake... the best part of any meal! We planned on getting 4 slices but unfortunately were only allowed to get 1 per person (sad face). We got the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the Andy's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. The Red Velvet came with slices of red velvet cake between their original cheesecake and cream cheese frosting with white chocolate shavings on the edge. Delicious. The Peanut Butter cheesecake was an orgasm in my mouth. Original Cheesecake swirled with caramel and peanut butter, with pieces of butterfinger and reeses peanut butter cups in layers and peanut butter frosting on top. Orgasmic indeed. Both came with a side of Whipped Cream as well. Our food was out within minutes of us ordering, the cheesecake shortly after, our waiter was very nice and checked up on us often to make sure we were pleased and was very quick with boxing our left overs.

The only problem is that Matt only took our order for drinks, not our food. We ended up waiting for Mika to come back from his 30 min break to order our food. THEN, as we watch other tables, who arrived after we did, get their food before we did, the food finally arrives another 30 mins later.   The food was great, with the exception of one of my girlfriends. She ordered salad and chicken wings...the problem was that the chicken wings were still RAW in the middle. We asked for the manager, and a gentleman came to our table. I did not get his name unfortunately, but he attempted to tell her that it was a blood vessel that popped during their ""double cooking"" process.   As a mom, and a cook, you know that the blood would be burgundy if the blood vessel popped during the frying, not RED! Thank goodness, he took it off the bill, but we were dissatisfied all together that instead of accepting responsibility, he made it seem as if the chicken was supposed to be that way.  The friend who recomended that we visit this establishment, said that she had pristine service before, so we were all baffled at the mistreatment we received on our visit.

However, we were so disappointed on this visit ~ we were seated quickly and I requested a high chair for my grand daughter, asked for child's menus and told the gentleman that it was my daughter's birthday, 10 minutes later, nothing. No high chair, menus nor had a waitress come to take our drink order. People seated after us had already given their drink orders and one table already had their high chair ~ the situation got worse, 2 meals came out while we waited another 10 minutes for the other 2. It was only after my daughter ordered cheesecake did 2 servers sing her Happy birthday ~ while there had been another table that had a group of 5 servers sing to the birthday person. I felt completely discriminated and disregarded ~ I have never been made to feel this way at any establishment and will NEVER set foot in a Cheesecake Factory restaurant again.

Aaron M.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,48,1,1.0,7/24/2014,"There are a couple uncomfortable things you can do when you work in a restaurant that will make not only a bad, but akward experience for a customer. Employees fighting, people that man the phones taking personal calls in front of customers etc. I found out another one last night when My GF and I went to this place around 930 for dinner. It was busy so they quoted a half hour wait but did say there was open seating at the bar...we saw two people get up so we figured if there was a full menu it would do. We sat down and their were two bartenders working, one stocky guy with a beard that was going a mile a minute and a young looking asian girl who was barely doing anything. Took about 10 mins to be acknowledged and then got our drinks placed next to the previous customers dirty plates (asked if he could clear it for us and was met with the response of ""will get to that in one second""). After we got our food we might as well have been invisible, needed a couple of things (tobasco, salt and pepper) and had to ask one of the waiters walking by, he looked annoyed and shouted at the bartender to come over and help us. The thing that made it akward was we kept noticing the girl bartender talking to two other patrons for most of our visit and ignoring pretty much everyone and everything else. We didn't put two and two together till she started EATING off the peoples plate and other employees kept stopping by and saying hi to them. It was then obvious that these were other employees on there off time and the bartender was better served eating with them and talking about how she had gone here and there the night before then making sure we had condiments for our food. This went on for literally the entire hour we were eating, my GF kept looking at me in shock like ""they are really carrying on and we can't even get our card run so we can leave"". Some places do not allow employees to fraternize at work in their off hours, I never agreed with that but there is a fine line where professionalism is lost because you want to BS with your co worker...this is not good practice in the restaurant business. The food was very good, but we got the basic apps and a piece of cheescake (kind of hard to F%$k that up). One star for the food but the rest was as bad as I've seen in a while, unfortunately will probably go back because they do serve food late...will just make sure to sit in the dining room this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=680

Tristan C.,"Beaverton, OR",14,15,,4.0,4/7/2013,"It's hard to do wrong at the Cheesecake Factory. Honestly, the menu is a book, so if you don't like something, you can always order something else next time. That said, the service is what makes or breaks a location, and the service at this location is amazing, at least when you have Delisa (spelling?) as a server.  We shared servings of the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes (at Delisa's recommendation, but only available during Sunday brunch) and the California Omelet. Both were delicious, but the pancakes were fluffy, and almost creamy. I know that's weird for a pancake, but it gave a nice tangy flavor along with fluff - amazing.  The omelette, while yummy, was relatively basic. The real star of that dish was the potatoes we got on the side. I know that sounds silly, but they were perfect. Another yummy thing we has was their espresso, which was well made and sweet. One thing that could VASTLY improve this location is their mandatory valet.

I had been told that if I got there at 530p ahead of the party, that we could be seated at 7p when the rest of the party was to arrive.  When I got there around 550p I was told differently. The manager, Chris, came over to me and explained the situation. Even though he couldn't change the amount of time it would take to be seated inside the restaurant (2 hours from the moment the whole party had arrived! Since guest were to arrive at 7, that meant 9p!) he did offer a solution. He was able to open up a space on the water called the beachfront seating. He lit up the firepit, opened the side curtains of a big booth, and turned on the heat lamps to make the area more inviting as it was currently not being used due to the season (fall is upon us). When the guests arrived at 7p everyone was pleasantly surprised with the pretty view on the water. We didn't have a waiter and had to order our food at the bar or to go (which we then took outside to eat) but everyone had somewhere to sit and food to eat. Chris was very attentive throughout the night making sure we were taken care of. The manager also came out himself and sang the birthday boy happy birthday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=720

They have plenty of cocktails as well.  Their mojitos are pretty delicious, particularly the pomegranate one.  There's a Cheesecake Factory all over the place, and while a little pricey, it's still delish.   If you are coming here with a group, DEFINITELY come early and be prepared to WAIT.  They don't take reservations.  Normally at lunch time, it will be easier to  get a table.  There's my lil tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=720

It was my first time at one of these locals so I wasn't expecting much. It was very full inside and outside. Maybe it was packed because I went on a Saturday, I don't know. Anyway, we were seated outside in the worst seat possible. My partner demanded we sit somewhere else since we weren't happy with the place they seated us. So we were seated somewhere else. The lady who accommodated us somewhere else was very chill about it just like they should be. Anyway, the waiter who seated us prior brought us stale bread. The bread was cold and very hard but after we were seated in the other table the bread was warm and soft. I guess it all depends on the waiter you get. I ordered the Fillet Mignon and it wasn't the best. It was mediocre at best. It had some fat and it wasn't as tender as I would have liked it. Overall, I don't see what the hype about this place is.

We got there at about 6:30 but we were not actually seated until 8:30. I know that cheesecake does not take reservations but the least they can do is put heating lamps outside for the people waiting for their seat. Even during summer nights, given the location, it get chilly after 7:00pm. Now the reason why I decided to overlook the long and cold wait is because of the excellent service. The first waiter was amazing and patient while 6 indecisive girls took their sweet time ordering. He accommodated all our requests and adjustments to our meals. Afterwards, we asked if we can close that tab at that table and move near the fire pits for desert. When we got there we realized that the waiter serving near the fire pits needed to leave as his shift was over and they would no longer be serving in that area. However, after we explained to him that it was my birthday, he was willing to stay and serve us even if it meant working when he didn't have to.

The Cheesecake Factory menu is vast with so many varieties.  I've ventured out several times, but I think you may be better served to just stick with dishes you like (because there are a lot of mediocre and even worse-than-mediocre dishes on the menu).  In terms of dessert, I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, but they have a few styles that aren't that bad.  The non-cheesecake dessert options are very average. I've also been here for brunch.  The food was just okay at brunch time. In terms of this location, the service is kind of inconsistent.  The place gets incredibly busy, and some servers can handle it better than others.  The atmosphere at the Marina Del Rey location is great.  The indoor dining is nice, and the outdoor dining next to the water is also good.  One of the more interesting things about this location are the people who frequent it--you will see a lot of middle-aged men (or older) with some very young women (try and guess wife or daughter?). The food at Cheesecake Factory really depends on what you order.  Some of it is better than others.  I recently had the miso salmon here, and it was pretty good.  If you know what's good, you should have (at the very least) a decent meal.  If you don't, all bets are off.  On the whole, a grade of 2.5 stars is probably fair.  Parking is valet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=800

My cousin stopped off at one of her favorite bakery's to grab cupcakes for the birthday girl before joining the party. As we were packing up to head to our next destination a bus boy squeezes through the crowd and begins to rigorously clean the tables we had just gotten up from. My cousin says to the bus boy politely as she puts on her sweater ""don't touch that, I'll get it."" He acted as if he didn't hear her. She said again, ""sir, don't touch that, I'm going to get it."" He ignored her once more and yanks the bag the cupcakes were resting in. The next thing I hear is my cousin shriek ""OH NO!""  As you can imagine, all 12 cupcakes were turned upside down making them less than presentable for my Aunt. She immediately called for a manager (Audrianna). After explaining the story to Audrianna, her response was ANYTHING BUT sympathetic. She said ""I'm sorry, that your cupcakes were ruined, but you left the table unattended."" WE DIDN'T. She said, ""I'm sorry, but I'm sure he didn't mean to do that on purpose."" No one is saying that he meant to ruin the cupcakes on purpose (although when a customer tells your employee TWICE not to touch their personal belongings and they disregard your wishes, you have to wonder) but that does not take away the fact that your employee ruined them and we need to have something to present to our Birthday girl.  Audrianna's remedy? We had two options: She could take the cupcakes and clean them up and put whip cream on them; or ONE slice of cheesecake. WHIP CREAM (No icing huh?) ON A CUPCAKE OR ONE SLICE OF CHEESECAKE? 12 cupcakes were ruined.   We asked to speak to another manager. She said there was no one else on duty. We asked if there was someone we could call. She said no. We were going in circles with this woman for about 20 minutes before she offered us a small round cheesecake. Again, What kind of offer is that? Finally, she realized that we were not going to accept being treated that way and she offered a medium cheesecake. The bus boy (who never apologized), Audriana and her lack of customer service did a GREAT disservice not only to paying customers but to the entire organization. She should NOT be the face of Cheescake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=800

It only gets 1 star because there was nothing redeeming about this place.  Even when we were moved the tables were awfully crowded together.  Food was just ok.  Our appetizer was great but everything else was pretty low quality.  Huge portions don't make up for stale tastless rice, frozen fries, and cole slaw with more dressing than vege.  It was just unappealing mass produced heart attacks on a plate dripping in fat and sodium filled sauces.

Diane D.,"Culver City, CA",1,17,,1.0,8/29/2014,"WORST SERVICE EVER!  We arrived at this restaurant at 6:50 PM on a Thursday evening, a party of five, to celebrate a birthday. We asked for patio seating and were told it would be a 30-minute wait.  They gave us one of their buzzer light-up devices and we took a table in the bar, about 15 feet away from the front desk. We waited 10 minutes for a waiter to take our drink order, and when he did, he acted as though it was the last place on earth he wanted to be.  We paid the check and waited to be called for a table. And waited. And waited.  A full hour later we approached the desk and were told that our device was defective and that they had called out the name of our party several times. Remember, we were only about 15 feet away. And there were five of us. Not one of us heard the page. I approached a manger who was all loosey goosey about it. ""Oh yeah well, we're waiting for a party to leave so you can sit.""  I went back to the bar and another manager came out and apologized profusely. He said they had paged us FIVE MINUTES AFTER WE ARRIVE!  So in theory, we could have just about been done eating our dinner by the time they finally addressed our problem.  We were then seated at a lovely table on the patio.  The food was good but the birthday spirit had deflated by then.

The food here was definitely good.  I got the Mesa Chicken, which I loved, and my boyfriend got the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  The downside was that the shrimp were supposed to be fairly spicy on their own, and he asked for the chef to make it extra spicy.  It ended up coming out completely lacking ANY spice.  We let our server, Ian, know that, and he went into the kitchen and asked the chef to make a serving of the sauce extra spicy, which he brought out in a bowl for us.  That was awesome, and it made the dish perfect.  We got the artichoke as an appetizer and it was alright; the sauces that came with it, though, were phenomenal.  I would order it again just for the sauces. All in all, I'd say it was a decent dining experience.  Yeah, there's a valet there, but who cares.  It's less than five bucks.  Get over it, people.  That parking lot isn't the biggest and if you had to self-park, you'd be bitching that there's no valet. Oh, one last note: if it's warm enough out, try and sit outside, especially at night.  There is a very nice ambience with the string lights overhead and the beach right there.  There are also space heaters that make it just as warm and cozy as if you were inside.

Kristin K.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,326,13,2.0,6/1/2009,"Just like Jewelyn T, I come here a few times a year because I live close. Most of the time, it's because I've done something really incredible, like play tennis for 6 hours or had a photo shoot all day or something that would take all my energy out of me. Do I go to a spa? Do I got to a yoga class? Nope! I feed my face with All-American portions at the Cheesecake Factory (or Todai... you can read all about that in my review).  First off, mandatory valet parking is a necessary evil but it's also pretty annoying when you go at lunch on a weekday at a time when it is NOT busy and you watch the guy park your car 10 yards from you and then expects $4.50 to walk back and get it for you. I understand the need for mandatory valet at a place so busy like that but at some point it becomes ridiculous. When I go to the cheesecake factory, especially this one, I feel like cattle being herded around (maybe also because I'm going to be the size of one by the time I leave). Service is decent about 35% of the time. The rest of the time it's slow, my food has come out cold a few times, they can't cook a steak right (hey, if you're going to have a filet on the menu and ask me how I want it prepared, learn how to cook it!) and they've calculated the bill wrong or given us the wrong one and then take 30 minutes to fix it. I was going to give it 3-stars since it is OK and I seem to go back there, but the last few times I've gone is has been below average. I truly have experienced better. If you are looking for Cheesecake Factory portions, and even very similar menu items including the cheesecake, try Grand Luxe at the Beverly Center.

We were surprisingly seated right away, it was Cinco de mayo so I anticipate that everyone was at a Mexican restaurant instead. It was pretty full though and there were a lot of birthdays as the staff sang happy birthday 5 times during our dinner. Courses were better than usual, around the table we had: jambalaya, salad, flatiron steak and fries and I ordered off of their new mini appetizer menu which totally reminded me of what you would get at a tapas restaurant.  Appetizers I got were a spicy sausage with sun dried tomato and mashed potatoes - the sausage patties, though tasty, seemed incredibly undercooked so I only had a couple of bites then moved them around my plate so no one would try to convince me to return them - DH gave me a wonderful phobia of returning food since restaurant folk like to do nasty things to your food.  I also got parmesan stuffed dates wrapped in bacon which was good but would have been great if it were hot. Finished off with some coffee and their 30th anniversary cheesecake, which is my favorite.  Hostess took away a chair from our table though while someone was in the bathroom and didn't even ask and gave it to another table.

My husband hates valet because he hates anybody else touching his car. However there's no way out of valet since there's nowhere else to park.

Of course, their desserts are famous, delicious and decadent.  I don't usually indulge in the sweets after dinner.  No room...their meals fill me up.   You must valet park, unless you have a friend who lives in the neighborhood.  Lucky me...I just walk there.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=860

Emma L.,"San Diego, CA",0,43,8,4.0,12/5/2010,"I don't typically write reviews for chain restaurants but I really had to for this one. I've gone to several Cheesecake Factories in several cities but this one stands out. This restaurant by far had the friendliest employees! When we were leaving the restaurant, nearly every single worker from cooks to the bakery staff, greeted us on our way out! What a fun way to leave a restaurant? The food is good, of course. I came for brunch and the French Toast Napolean ($10.95) was delicious. It consists of 3 fat pieces of French toast with tons of strawberries in between and candied pecans!! I was pretty hungover so I wasn't able to finish it but I had some later in the evening and it was even better? I guess its one of those things that are better a little cold.. haha My bf ordered the Chicken Marcel Blanc. You get 2 large pieces of flattened, crispy chicken breast, huge serving of mashed potatoes, and some broccoli. Good deal for $12.95.  Strawberry Lemonade is sort of a rip-off at $4.50 since most of the glass consists of ice. Its free re-fills but still, $4.50? We had 3 glasses of it total but take out the ice and it still wouldn't have been one full glass. Red Robin's Strawberry Lemonade is way better too.  Their bread is delicious too. I don't know how but the waitress just knew we wanted only the wheat bread so we just had baskets of amazing wheat bread. The patio has a great view of the dock too. Definitely a pleasure to sit outside!  The only downside is that our waiter was sort of whatever so our service was a bit slow. All the other employees I spoke with were ridiculously nice and incredibly friendly though. Everyone from the bakery, the server who brought our meal, etc so I wouldn't put the bad service as a deal breaker since everyone else was so nice. My waiter probably was just having a bad day?

I hate how there's so much mediocre food on their menu that it takes my companions 12 hours to decide what they want. The food there is actually pretty reliable. It doesn't taste bad.

Liz K.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,187,12,5.0,6/25/2010,"During my last visit to The Cheesecake Factory in Marina del Rey I received some of the most amazing customer service of my life. This place can be a mad house during the dinner rush, but its usually well worth the hassle. The staff definitely goes out of their way to make your experience positive and pleasurable.  After being told that the wait for a table was an hour and a half we were directed to the downstairs beach side patio, where we could order drinks while we waited. This waiting patio is a GENIUS idea! No one likes to sit in the cramped lobby of a restaurant next to 30 other families awkwardly waiting to be seated. This patio was not crowded at all, was right near the water with beautiful views of the boats in the marina, and being able to order cocktails definitely makes the time go by faster. The cocktails at Cheesecake are some of the best Ive ever tasted, my favorites being The Ritz or the Peach Bellini. It's super easy to rack up a significant bill before you even get to eat dinner.  Once we were seated we asked for extra bread due to the number of people in our party, a request which the waiter quickly fulfilled, bringing us enough of that delicious brown bread for a lifetime. MMMM brown bread = so good! We all ordered our entrees and continued sipping on our beverages and munching on bread until the food arrived. I ordered the Chicken Medallions, which, in my opinion, is one of the healthier options they have (they feature A LOT of pasta and carb loaded dishes). The waiter either heard me wrong or wrote down the wrong thing, so I received the Chicken Madeira instead, which is delicious in its own right, but just not what I had ordered. I informed him of the problem and he apologized and quickly ran to the kitchen to correct the mistake. Upon returning he offered me a salad or soup on the house while I waited for the correct dish to be prepared. I asked for baby greens with balsamic, which was totally yummy and distracted me from the fact that all my friends were eating their food while I was still waiting for mine. Then TWO different managers came by our table to apologize some more, and they offered to buy me another Ritz martini on the house as well. I have never experienced such amazing customer service in my life! My food was ready in a reasonable amount of time, especially considering the snafu, and I got a free salad and drink out of the deal. I couldnt really ask for anything more.

This place is ALWAYS packed, the parking lot is LITERALLY a parking lot, even as you're trying to leave, and as far as I can tell, you HAVE to valet, even though you could easily park your car yourself. Expect a wait here, no matter what. As has been said, the food is mediocre. Any place that gives you a choice of ANYTHING (Mexican, Italian, American, Asian) is clearly unfocused and anything you order comes out as such.

From the moment they tried to seat us to paying the bill, I could not understand how this place could let themselves slip so badly. Though there were plenty of tables, the host inevitably wanted to seat us right near the wait/busboy station. Big buckets of dirty dishes and the order terminal do not make a good time. When we asked for a table not so close to the bus station, the host simply said, ""Fine. Sit where you want."" Our waitress was a loon. Somehow we got the one waitress who was assigned to at least 3 different sections of the restaurant. She was all over the room, yet never managed to get us water, bring us menus, nor refill our drinks. We waited a painfully long time and she was just not a good waitress. The other wait staff really do not care. If you are not their customer, they will not even look at you. One waiter constantly checked the payment folders for his tip and when we asked him for help, he told us flatly, that ""it was not his station.""

We told the waiter about my allergy to gluten and he went to the chef with our questions. He not only came back with answers but he also came back with suggestions of other gluten free menu items. The chef was willing to open up a fryer just fro me so that I could have gluten free sweet potato fries. To me that was awesome, the chef knew about gluten allergies and was willing to make exceptions and accommodate my request. Definitely worth four stars.

We went outside and it was absolutely beautiful, the terraced patios really added to the ambiance of the meal, had no clue why people wanted to sit inside!

If your don't care that your customers get served finger nails than it might be time to find a new job.

He couldn't figure out how to split the check in a timely fashion (we had another reservation we had to make on time) and again, stemmed to be upset with our table. Plus....

I asked for patio seating got stuck right next to the door where all the servers come in and out. Ordered our food and drinks, appetizers came out fairly quickly and that is where it stopped. Almost 2 identical meals ordered mine came out on its own .. About 10 minutes went by no meal for my husband.. He goes to restroom and waitress comes over and says they gave his meal to the wrong table! Said they were remaking his meal and that a manager would be by to speak to my husband when he got back to the table ... That never happened no one apologized that I was eating and he had no meal after about an hour his meal came which was steak Diane which is NOT supposed to be spicy! I think they dumped the whole bottle of pepper in it! He is now home getting sick and the waitress knowing his meal was out much later than mine came over and said let me clear these plates away for you! Did not even ask If he was finished! Horrible horrible service and I will never go back! Shame on you Cheesecake! No apology no money taken off bill and to top it off it was my Birthday!

Jennifer N.,"Long Beach, CA",444,1095,12272,2.0,5/5/2010,"How could a Cheesecake Factory be only a 2 stars??!! I've been here a few times and every time I decide to give this location another try, I get disappointed... on the CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  I've even done a third party Mystery Secret Shopping/dinning at this location before for corporate @ this location always sends assignments out, because I'm sure reviews from the Mystery diners are not that great either!  I'm not too thrilled on this location to begin with. The Location is hard to locate and even a GPS gets confused.. lol  It's a smaller Cheesecake restaurant, But it seems like the setting of the restaurant just didn't seem right. The Kitchen is in the front left side of the restaurant and located between the entrance of the restaurant between a very small and tight pathway and the hostess table where customers checks in. People walking and stopping in between this short walkway bumping heads and feet.  The Kitchen's counter top is where the chefs put the plates of food out for the waiters to serve. It is on a low level, reachable counter. With customers and employees walking in and out, I can just imagine the dusts and germs flying all over the food. When we were walking out of the restaurant, I witnessed this guy sneezing. Didn't cover his mouth and a plate of salad is left there on the counter where his saliva probably flew into the salad. :-( GROSS!!  Here goes our journey..  Pulled into the parking lot and parked by the the cleaners. The valet guy comes over and screamed, That's pay parking! I said excuse me sir? he said, ""Paid Parkin, I said.""  I gave him the $3.50 he asked for and he didn't give me a ticket. I asked for a ticket and he said no need. How the heck do you charge me for Valet parking and don't put a ticket on my car. What if another valet driver don't see the ticket and get my car towed??? There was another car that pulled in. Obviously he had a complaint too because We were both waiting on the Manager to come talk to us.  We spoke to the manager and she apologized behalf of the valet service and just explained that each location and city has their own parking policies. Fine, I respected that. So then she went out right away to tell the Valet service guy!! .. Uh, wait a minute, should I leave, what if they do damaged to my car out of anger.. sigh...  (You see, the Redound Beach location where I go to most of the time has a small parking spaces for handicap parkings, take outs and a few limited regular parking spots for people who doesn't want to pay for valet parking. Marina Del Rey has those parking spots too, but they choose to charge their customers for the parking. )  While being served, Our server wasn't too thrilled about the fact we wanted refills on their bread. Well, sometimes, I go there for their delicious bread, but not like we didn't order any main dishes. We did!!  The water with lemon the waiter served us, 2 out of 5 cups tasted funny.. There was a goat cheese like after taste in my water!! My Mother said the same thing about her cup of water. We called the waiter and nicely asked him if he can exchange the water for us. I even showed him the greasy residue that was left on our cups. He said sure and walked off like we bothered him. NO Sorry?.. NO, explanations?.. NO excuse us for not washing our cups clean enough!! We were NOT difficult customers and even try not to bother him too much. He wasn't as friendly as I expected it to be, because I have high expectations of friendliness customer service from them. Well consider me spoiled by the other Cheesecake Factory locations. If something like this would happened, a manager would of showed up at our table with the waiter and apologized behalf of their business.  What do you expect when you go to Cheesecake Factory?? Great food and Beyond Great friendly Customer service, because that is what they are known for and that is what I usually get when I go to their other locations.  Sadly to say, I will never return to this location again... EVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-marina-del-rey?start=840

Lad D.,"Chelsea, MA",26,22,6,2.0,5/15/2011,"So I meet up with good friends for Sunday brunch. They order 'real' food and I order a salad. Surprisingly, their food comes out first and is beginning to get cold as I wait for my salad. Eventually it comes out, ten minutes later. The manager comps the salad. As I'm down to my last bite, I notice there is something coarse and somewhat crunchy. I pull the object out of my mouth and it's a piece of spiraled green plastic with some sharp edges. Of course I call for the manager. A different one comes out and gives the perfunctory apology and the ""if there's anything that I can do"" line.

I've had ribs (loved them), orange chicken (I order this most often), and quite a few salads (saves room for cheesecake). If you're not needing to impress anyone and have concerns about the valet service, there's a large county parking lot within walking distance by Mothers Beach. Parking there is about 6 bucks. On warm summer days this place can be extremely packed and waiting is likely on nice summer evenings (especially weekends). There is food service in the bar (if you're not wanting to wait for a dining area table) and service there has been fine every time we've opted for it.

But the weird part is they have a bar downstairs, its just empty, not staffed or stocked. so the entire place has to wait for this one small bar to serve them. i know its a problem because when we got our table and ordered drinks and food, our food came before our drinks.  but other than that the food was good, and the out side seating is nice at night or day.
