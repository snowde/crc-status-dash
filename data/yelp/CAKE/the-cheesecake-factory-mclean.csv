Cal H.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",118,149,142,3.0,4/23/2017,"I ordered a slice of cheesecake to go on 3-12-2017.  It was the salted caramel cheesecake.  Looked really good behind the glass.  The server was Paije W.  Well, thank goodness that I didn't have to pay for the side order of attitude because he was definitely serving that up!!  I let it slide this time because I was leaving.  The cheesecake was a decent size but I thought it was a bit overpriced at $9 for one slice.  I rarely order dessert, but wanted to treat myself this day.  It was good, but the attitude of the server makes me not want to order to go dessert again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=40
Dave H.,"Falls Church, VA",0,125,3,4.0,9/6/2016,"It's been a long time since my partner and I have visited a Cheesecake Factory and the reason that changed tonight was because of their new CakePay app and support for Apple Pay. I heard from a friend how great the experience was using the app and had to see for myself.  Service and food were very good. I've always found Cheesecake Factory to be pretty consistent in both of those areas. I tend not to go there much because the portions are just too large.  After we were seated I checked in on the CakePay app and it generated a four digit code that I gave to the server. A few minuets after he took our order the items showed up in the app.  We shared the the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and it was tasty. Liked the mashed potatoes that came with it and the asparagus was okay.  Love the size of the glasses which meant it was easy for the waiter to keep up with my ice tea consumption.  Had the Pumpkin Cheesecake to finish off the meal. Another tasty dessert.  All of the items showed up in the app very quickly after being ordered and I hit the pay button, was offered an option to split the bill and add a gratuity and swipe to pay with Apple Pay.  The app presented an option to provide feedback which consisted of a star rating and a yes/no on whether I would use the system again (YES). I got an email receipt a few minutes later and the waiter came over to thank us and say we were good to go.  Based on this experience with the app I'll be dining more often at the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=40

Timothy T.,"Springfield, VA",443,79,60,3.0,8/2/2016,"3.5*** The service was great! Our waiter was knowledgeable on the food and the cheesecakes and answered our questions very well. One person in our group had  allergies and our waiter recommended what foods to avoid. Although we went on National Cheesecake Day, which granted us %50 off of all cheesecakes, but that did not really help the case. The food is why I rated The Cheesecake Factory a 3.5/5. The portions are amazing, but the quality is ""ehhhhh"". Like I said in my other reviews, it's more about paying for the experience rather than the food. In addition, the Cheesecake that I got (chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake) didn't even taste like cheesecake or have any cheesecake flavors. Good for groups and if you're hungry because they will give you large portions, but do not have high expectations on the quality of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=40
Susan H.,"Reston, VA",452,634,1111,3.0,10/15/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory was the first one we went to.  When it opened, it was crazy busy for a long time so we waited until the hype died down.  We had high expectations after hearing how good the food was and the cheesecakes were the best.  I'll give them that---their cheesecakes are great!  The food...well...it's not outstanding. We hadn't been to a Cheesecake factory in years.  This past Sunday we were at the Galleria and decided to go as it is one of the cheapest places to have dinner in the mall.   We were there around 5 p.m. and the place was doing a brisk business.  Once seated, our server was prompt getting to our table.  We gave our drink orders.  I had a mixed drink, I think the name was JW's lemonade.  It turned out to be a decent well made drink with good flavor.  My husband had a Coors Light. I had my eye on the 1/2 sandwich and soup menu item.  That is, until I found out that there is only 1 soup available and it changes daily.  The soup of the day was chicken soup with artichokes and mushrooms, so I gave it a pass.  I ended up ordering the chicken salad sandwich which consists of:  ""housemade with roasted almonds, lettuce, tomato and mayo on grilled brioche bread"".  For a side, I chose fries.   My husband ordered a turkey club sandwich only to have our server come back to our table to tell us that the restaurant was out of turkey.  Seriously?  It sounds like the culinary manager isn't on top of things.  So, he ordered an old fashioned burger which consists of:  ""charbroiled on a toasted brioche bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles and mayo""  For his side, he chose carrots. The chicken salad sandwich was huge!  I guess no one makes normal sized sandwiches anymore!  It didn't hold together well and was rather messy to eat.  The almonds, while sparsely present, did add a nice crunch.  One half of the sandwich oddly had a spicy taste that shouldn't have been there.  The fries were dry and flavorless. My husband said his burger was good.  It was cooked as he ordered and he did enjoy it saying he liked the charbroiled flavor. We didn't get any cheesecake.  However, in the past when we've gone to the Cheesecake factory, we have ordered some to go.  Every time we've had some, we've never been disappointed. I suppose that we will go again sometime.  One thing I've never liked about them---their menu is like a book.  So, it's best to decide beforehand if you want a main course meal, a sandwich, burger or flatbread, etc.  as it will be easier to narrow it down. Before the tip, dinner cost $42 + change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=40
Robert S.,"Washington, DC",2,8,,1.0,12/28/2017,"My wife and I have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory several times, mostly at the Mclean location and usually with positive results. On Christmas Eve Day we decided to have brunch and arrived as they opened. My menu choice this time was chicken marsala and to say it was terrible is an insult to all things terrible. It had absolutely no taste or even a hint of flavor or seasoning. Usually when ordering this dish the standard way it is served is with a generous portion of sauce to go along with the chicken and pasta. Mine was dryer than the Sahara and I had to ask our server for some (not additional) sauce for my meal. It took about 10-15 minutes to arrive at our table as they had to prepare it from scratch. It really made no difference at all to the quality of my meal nor did it satisfy me at all. I made a comment to my wife that it was like I tried to make chicken marsala which would be amazing as I cannot cook nor do I even attempt but my wife is a very accomplished cook and baker. To make matters worse our server never returned our debit card we gave her to pay. My wife noticed two days later and had to drive 20 minutes each way to retrieve it. What is normally a very enjoyable experience at TCF on this day was a complete disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=40

Diamond B.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,13,7,2.0,3/19/2017,"Worst Cheesecake Factory in the DMV!!  Our food was cold with barely any sauce, we got the jambalaya pasta and the chipotle pasta..typically very saucy at other locations.

Came in for lunch with some higher-ups (their suggestion) and nothing anyone got was particularly good. The salmon I got was overly dry which was pretty disappointing.

I was expecting amazing quality and great presentation and generous portions.  Our server was great but whoever is cooking needs to get fired. I ordered gluten free shrimp pasta. I would say the pasta was perfectly cooked but the over all dish was under seasoned and my shrimp was over cooked bleh. We also ordered ahi tuna salad, but the presentation was poorly executed and the amount of salad and Ahi tunA was served was bare minimum. I felt like they didn't have enough of anything in the kitchen on how it was served on my plate. For a dish that is $20 I would expect it to be full of color and generous amount of salad and tuna.

They do offer a a lot of options on the menu, and most of it is your typical all-American comfort food.    The portions are not that bad!  This time around I had the Baja Chicken Sandwich.  My friend had the crab cake entree and Rotini Alfredo.  I have to say that every time that I've I have never tried any food there that wasn't good.  Also the service has always been right on cue!  Compared with other Cheesecake Factories and Burger King's in, I think this place is slightly more busy  One reason why I come here is the location close to work, and the fact that it's the very close to the metro.

Jasmine A.,"Alexandria, VA",153,81,571,3.0,8/2/2016,"Came here for a late lunch with my cousins.  The selection from their menu is HUGE which can be a problem when you are indecisive. I stick with my go to which is the Cajun jambalaya pasta.  I was thinking I can't go wrong with fresh pasta, shrimp and chicken in a Cajun sauce.  Except I was wrong because it wasn't that great.  The dish was watery tasting and didn't have enough of a Cajun flavor.  My pasta was overcooked and borderline mushy.  The shrimp and chicken were okay.  I just remembered that this used to be one of the best dishes I ever had but now it is not that good. We also got the egg roll platter which was pretty good, all different kinds of egg rolls.  The avocado one was really good. My cousin order the bang bang chicken and shrimp and it was disappointing.  I think the chef changed the recipe because from what I remembered it was a red coconut curry sauce filled with veggies.  This time it was yellow with shredded zucchini and carrots. There was not enough curry sauce for the amount of rice given.  The zucchini and carrots were not necessary in the dish if you were going to shred the veggies. At least cut it in bite size to make the dish more appealing.  We also got the bistro shrimp pasta and Louisiana chicken pasta. These two pasta dishes were definitely better than the other dishes we ordered.  The bistro shrimp pasta had crispy breaded shrimp with arugula in a creamy garlic sauce.  The Louisiana pasta had a nice spicy sauce which tasted better than my jambalaya pasta.  Next time, I will try something different.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=40
Ravens Fan N.,"Fairfax County, VA",1,57,6,1.0,5/27/2017,"My family ate at the Tysons Corner restaurant around 4:30pm on 5/26/17. Our server was Carla. The first thing I told Carla was that my 7-year-old daughter has a dairy allergy. She confidently told us that the kids' spaghetti and meatball did not contain dairy. So that's what we ordered. After my daughter had almost finished her plate, she felt sick. I spoke with the manager and asked what ingredients the meatball contained. Parmesan cheese. My daughter felt sick for 6 hours until she finally vomited the pasta. Thanks Carla. You made my daughter sick. (I had already given her Benadryl once she said she was sick). At the beginning of our meal, we had asked for the bread that does not contain dairy. Carla's facial expression showed us that our request was more of a bother. When she came back with sourdough bread, she said ""this bread contains the least amount of dairy."" Least amount? Really? A food allergy is a food allergy, whether a person is exposed to a little or a lot. This just showed us what little knowledge this employee had of food allergies. Thank goodness my daughter did not go into anaphylaxis. Cheesecake Factory needs to step up the training of their employees and teach them the seriousness of food allergies. Someone could die. No joke. Just to add, this was not our first time eating at Cheesecake Factory. My daughter had no problems before. So disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=40

Nadine F.,"Brussels, Belgium",347,1076,5,3.0,2/22/2015,"This location entirely met my expectations for Cheesecake Factory.  We received a gift card recently, so we've been here a couple of times in the past few weeks.  Service has always been good and reasonably fast. The food is exactly what you expect from a Cheesecake Factory.  They have hundreds (or is it actually in the thousands?) of menu items, and all are just OK.  The cheesecake just isn't worth the calories for me at this particular location, when there's the delicious Danielle's Desserts making higher quality, fresher items on the same floor of the same mall.  And if you're going for flavor and quality of food, there are definitely better restaurants inside the mall (all of them).   However, if you want to feed many people on a budget or have leftovers to eat for lunch for several days, Cheesecake Factory is a good option.  Their entrees contain what should be between two and five servings for a reasonable human being.   I appreciate that since the last time I was here, which was fine to ten years ago, they've added a skinny menu, and the veggie burger was bland, but not terrible.  We also got a piece of cheesecake to go, and it tasted like it had been previously frozen and hadn't been thawed all the way, so I probably won't be getting any cheesecake here again as I try to use up my gift card.   The happy hour specials are solid, so that would be my main reason to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=100

We were told that there was no table ready for us. After waiting for twenty minutes they brought us to a groups of tiny tables in the bar section that had been pushed together, instead of seating us in the dining room. After we placed our orders, we waited for awhile. The waiter only brought entrees for two of the people in our group. The rest of us sat there for another half hour waiting for our meals.  I ordered one of the simplest entrees to prepare, fettuccini Alfredo. The waiter brought a large plate of over cooked pasta. When I tasted it it was literally a mouthful of flour. It took a long time for the waiter to return to our section, and he was ignoring us. When he finally came to our table I told him that the Alfredo sauce was missing from my dish. He did not take the dish and he left the area again.  After another long wait we motioned to the waiter. I told him once again that the dish needed the sauce. Again he left without taking the dish. After another long wait we asked another waiter for the Alfedo sauce. By now everyone else had eaten their entree. Our waiter finally appeared with a very small container of a basic white sauce, not Alfedo sauce, which contains cheese.  There was another long wait to hail the waiter. This time I picked the dish up and handed it to him and said to bring it back to the kitchen for Alfredo sauce. When the dish came out it had the same tasteless basic white sauce with no cheese in it, not Alfedo sauce. By now everyone else was well into their desserts, and I gave up on dinner. This is the first adverse experience I have had at this chain, and I am surprised at how this restaurant has gone downhill at this location.

Jesse S.,"Little Elm, TX",108,782,26,1.0,1/2/2015,"Came to this location at 5pm with a party of 9. Our waiter didn't take our order for 30 minutes. After waiting another 30 minutes, our kids' meals and salads came. One kid's meal was totally wrong, one was missing the side dish, and a salad had the wrong dressing. After another half hour, our entrees were served. One entree was missing a substitution, one entree had the wrong side dish, and one entree had overcooked/stale rice that was inedible.  Just to summarize, out of 9 items that were ordered, 2 were correct and 7 were wrong, and the wait time to get our incorrect entrees was 1.5 hours. I had to send my entree back and instead of remaking it, they removed the incorrect item and gave it back to me. It was served completely cold.  I found the restaurant manager and notified him of all the problems we had encountered during our visit. Neither the manager nor the server apologized for the poor service, the service did not improve after I complained, and we were not given any credit or discount off our check or offered a free desert or anything like that.  We were at the restaurant a total of 2.5 hours due to the slowness of getting our check and getting our credit cards back.

I was told to try back in an hour. At 10:30am, I was told to try back around 11:30am. I called again at 11:40am and was told he's still not there and to try back later. Nobody seemed to know when the general manager would be present. I called again at 1pm and was told he's busy and would have to call me back. I find the service we experienced to be offensive and unforgivable. I also find it disturbing that the manager made no attempt to rectify the situation. Although I almost never do this, I left a $0 tip, since our waiter clearly could care less about doing his job correctly. I think there is a serious lack of proper management at this location and I doubt I will ever return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=100

What makes this place great is that it's good for groups, their menus are extensive, and the portions are ever so generous for the price. They also have a skinny menu! (But it's not that much of a health conscious difference.)  However, in my opinion the quality of their food is just OK. I've had plenty of dishes from here from pastas, salads, cheesecakes (obviously their staple), etc. I'm unsure if they use frozen products, but something is always off for me. I want to love this place, but I always end up having an average experience. This time around I ordered the herb-crusted salmon salad- my salmon was cooked pretty well but it, along with my vegetables (not talking about the lettuce)-- was pretty much tasteless.  In addition, they are located inside the mall so it can get pretty busy and the wait for seating and/or food is always unpredictable especially because they don't take reservations!

The food was awful. The burger was decent but way over cooked. The pasta dishes were super bland and over cooked and the shrimp smelled like it was bad. The two Cajun pastas the guys ended up adding ketchup and Montreal steak seasoning too so it wasn't as bad. I threw out the shrimp alfredo it was sauce-less and bland.

Megan C.,"Herndon, VA",532,659,554,3.0,4/16/2014,"As many of my fellow Yelpers have pointed out, we're typically not wild about mega-conglomerate chain restaurants, although one could also argue that a chain like The Cheesecake Factory, especially this particular outpost inside swanky Tyson's Galleria, does have a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" when it comes to how it wears its big chain badge. Still, I feel 'A-OK' about The Cheesecake Factory and it's 800-page menu, its vague/non-existent disclosure of ingredients/nutritional info, etc., but again, I think it's important that a mega-chain review focus on the specific location as opposed to the chain itself. For that reason, I felt the service was adequate at this location. Food was delivered promptly and efficiently. Food was delivered mostly as ordered; salad had to be sent back due to inclusion of some things I had asked to do without. Friend's cheesecake to-go box was a strange debacle, as she wanted to box it herself, but server tried to insist he take it away to box it. The atmosphere can be loud and waits can be long, typical of most Cheesecake Factory outposts. Access from outside or inside Tyson's Galleria is convenient; it's on the 3rd floor of the mall or from the upper street level of the parking lot.

But overall, operations are slow, unchecked, and sloppy.  We have not gone to this location for awhile, but decided to give it a go. Appetizer, entree, and two slices of cheesecake at $50+ with tax and tip (no drinks, or extras). It's not inexpensive.  Avocado egg rolls came out soggy and just a sprinkle of the rice straws. Presentation looked sad.  Bang Bang chicken and shrimp would be better called 'rice mountain' with 4 pieces of shrimp and sporadic chicken pieces smothered in the sauce. Also, poorly presented.  They are always busy here so I don't imagine they are paying a lot of attention to the reviews, but in case they start to loose activity and decide to consider some opportunities for feedback, maybe they will come across this and others on Yelp and seriously consider re-upping their game. I would choose a fast food burger at Shake Shack or just about any other restaurant in Tyson's over this next time we want to head out.  Got me this time, but lost money from me in the future.

My food -- Baja chicken tacos came mid-way through everyone else's meal.  Someone (not our waitress) came twice, apologized and said they would make it up to us yet when the bill came it was for full price (oh, they did ""throw in"" a bday ice cream sundae).

At my friend's suggestions, we ordered the smallest portions of the following: Ahi tuna tartare salad, Shrimp and chicken gumbo with brown rice, and the Thai lettuce wrap.  The Ahi tuna salad was tiny, but delicious. Loved the soft avocados and tuna pieces that melted in my mouth. The soy sauce at the bottom was sweet but not too sweet. The shrimp and chicken gumbo with brown rice was quite good too! The chicken was a bit weird because the meat kind of looked like McDonalds chicken nuggets (meaning, not like chicken), but other than that, I loved the spices in this dish. A hint of spicy with a hint of sweetness. The Thai lettuce wrap, which came on a huge plate, was refreshing in comparison to the sauce-slathered gumbo. The lettuce was fresh, as were the mung bean sprouts. The three sauces (that you could add to your wrap to your choosing) perfected the dish.

At 9pm it was still pretty packed, so business must be good. I've never seen an empty Cheesecake Factory! We couldn't resist the tiramisu cheesecake, and it was even better because we had a $5 off coupon. The total came out to about $3.50, so there's no beating that. We also had a kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake (as well as another $5 coupon!). Out of the two, I certainly enjoyed the tiramisu more. I have a bias, however, because I already happen to love tiramisu. It was light and fluffy and not too sweet. The kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake would've been more enjoyable if it were more coffee than cocoa. The chocolate/fudge flavor was too much for my liking, and it would've been tastier if it were 70/30 coffee/cocoa. That's up to each individual's liking, though, so no stars deducted for that. Good value overall because of the two $5 coupons. $8.50 for a slice is a bit too much for my taste, so I probably wouldn't get future slices without coupons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=20

Unfortunately, we were seated under some air conditioning vents with the freezing air blowing directly on top of our heads and after a few minutes, the cold kicks in. So, me being me, asked our lovely waitress if they could 're-direct' the air that was hitting us because it was super cold or have the thermostat adjusted? She went and checked and she came back and said ""management said if they turned it down, then they'd get complaints on it being too hot"".  Wow. Our money really doesn't matter to them, eh?  Didn't even suggest moving us to another table. (I just thought of that. lol) Instead, you never saw two people eat so quickly to get the heck out of a restaurant.

Not even a glance our way. We never got our drinks refilled or anything. I had to wave her down to get our check.

However, I was shocked at the rude service at the Tysons Corner location. A waitress named Linda R was unpleasant and downright rude to my best friend. She didn't smile once, had an annoyed unpleasant expression on her face, and rolled her eyes with maximum snark and disapproval when my friend politely asked if we could have our leftovers boxed up to take home. Based on her unprofessional behavior, I left her no tip because she didn't deserve one -- she ruined our dinner and made it an unhappy time. The food itself was poorly prepared, because I ordered my usual favorite dish, the Factory Nachos, and some tortilla chips were overly baked and a nearly burnt dark brown, with not enough sour cream, salsa or guacamole. The lighting in the restaurant is way too dim, as if they're trying to hide unsanitary and poorly cleaned conditions. Before we left the restaurant, we visited the pastry section where customers can buy cheesecake desserts to take home. After she saw that we didn't leave her a tip, Linda marched over to the pastry area and gave us a dirty look, as if she was trying to chase us out with intimidation. I discreetly asked another employee if I could speak to her manager, and I described to him the terrible experience we had due to Linda's incompetent, hostile behavior. I told him that I didn't want to get her in trouble, but maybe someone could gently remind her that it is her job to be courteous and polite to customers. He dismissively said he was sorry for our ordeal, but brushed it off and walked away unconcerned, and didn't try to make it right.

As a Canadian, whenever I see Cheesecake Factory, I'm instantly drawn to it, and want to indulge so badly. I came for a late dinner to this location and got the chicken Madeira. It was really good, and such a huge portion I could not finish! Even their steaks come in 14 oz.  For cheesecake we got the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake. It also came in a large portion so I would recommend sharing. Definitely recommend this one if you love a chocolate overload.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=20
Jen R.,"Fairfax, VA",539,47,82,3.0,6/26/2017,"My boyfriend and I are Cheesecake Factory lovers. We went on a late Saturday night around 8:45pm. We walked in and the floors were a bit slippery and The temperature seemed to be a bit low. We got seated fairly quickly. We sat in a nice small booth, which felt cozy and romantic.  As an appetizer we got the edamame-delicious. We asked our waiter for only one basket of the wheat bread and we got that quickly. We normally order salads from the skinnylicious menu. This visit was no different, I got the factory chopper salad and he got the Mexican tortilla salad. Everything tasted great. However, I was not blown away by the service. It was a late night and our food took a long time to come out. The appetizer and main meal came out minutes a part. When we finally got our food, we didn't see our waiter for a long time. I ran out of water, which is a problem because I added Tabasco hot sauce to my salad. Service can improve and same with the slippery floors. Later, I noticed a family taking turns taking pictures and their was a group of wait staff just laughing and not paying attention to their clients, so I got up and took the family photo for the family. I know that's not part of food service, but it would have been nice if they were aware and could have offered. It's those little things that can go a long way!

Connie Y.,"Rockville, MD",254,97,1425,3.0,8/14/2016,"I believe we had a new waitress because the service was minimal, but on the upside she was really nice. We never got refills and had to ask for napkins and their complimentary bread.  Regardless, the three stars are for the food. My family started off with buffalo wings and fried calamari. While the calamari was crispy and tasty, the buffalo wings were tiny and over fried. I had a wing with only one bite, and at a price of $12.50 for 10 wings and wilting celery sticks, this was a disappointment. Then our entrees came, and I became even more disappointed! I had ordered the bistro shrimp pasta, one of my go-to dishes, only to discover there was no cream sauce added. I had to wait for them to bring out sauce only to have them bring out a tomato sauce! By the time I received my lemon-garlic cream sauce, everyone else was near finished with their meals. I did have my entree comped, so that was a pleasant surprise, but still. My mother's Cajun jambalaya shrimp pasta was delicious and flavorful as usual, with plenty of shrimp and soft noodles. Also be prepared to get their Bang Bang chicken and shrimp curry. It's an unappetizing bowl of rice sitting in a puddle of curry and meat chunks. I'm sure it tasted good though, since my uncle finished it.  For the desserts, we ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake and the Chocolate Mousse. Both were too airy and not creamy enough. Whether it was the warm temperature of the cheesecakes or overwhelming amount of whip cream sprayed on top, we weren't pleased with their signature dessert! We've had better quality from the frozen section at Costco where they sell Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes!   Fortunately, we've had better service and food at The Cheesecake Factory, so I still plan to return in the future, but I sure hope they improve!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=20

Macky N.,"Washington, DC",1,35,5,2.0,2/1/2016,"Let me start off by saying that this review is mostly about the service. I came to dine with my girlfriend and her sister.  Okay, so we'll start with the good. The cheesecake was great. Especially the banana, which actually tasted awesome. The food was pretty good. I got the garlic pasta, which was good. My girlfriend got the jambalaya, which tasted nothing like jambalaya, and although it says spicy, we ended up putting in a ton of Sriracha when we got home.  Then came our waiter.  Ricky R, from what it says on our receipt.  We had no bread to start. He came by when we weren't ready, I began to request which appetiser to start us off, he interrupted me to interject and ask what my girlfriend's sister wanted first. Okay, I'm all for ladys first, but I was trying to get us started with an appetiser because they still couldn't decide what they wanted. We ordered drinks, and I had finished mine before the appetiser came out, but it wasn't taken away until after the dinner. Asked for bread which came out after the appetiser. He proceeds to spend the rest of the meal not speaking to me at all, but to my girlfriend, until he brings out the check. At which time, I open it to see that he put a line next to the 20%, and a ""THANKS"" right beside it? I'm sorry, but where was the service that you provided me that was so great that you felt entitled enough to presume you were getting a 20% tip? I'm going to follow this up with the fact that my girlfriend works in the service industry as well, so whenever we go out, we tip at least 20%. More of the person was great, and genuine, but the least we will tip is 15% of the person was just awful and didn't care at all.  I know it seems like I'm getting worked up over nothing, and I've had a lot of bad service before due to the fact that I seem a bit younger, but the part that really bothers me is that he had the audacity to insinuate that I was required to give him a higher percentage tip when we started off the meal with him interrupting me, which he never even acknowledged. Then, he clearly didn't pay attention to our table since we had no bread to start, it took the whole bloody meal for my empty drink to be taken away, and when we asked for the dessert menu, he came back with two which he presented to my girlfriend and her sister. I ended up tipping over 20% because the food was not when it came out, and if I weren't in the equation, my girlfriend and her sister got pretty good service. Ricky R, if you are ever my waiter again and you pull the same stunt with the tip, you will get nothing out of pure principle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=240
Courtney S.,"Vienna, VA",123,30,11,4.0,8/24/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. They have a HUGE menu including a ""skinnylicious"" section for those watching their calories. I always order from that menu and everything is really good especially the shrimp tacos. Service is on point and the place is run like a well oiled machine. Last time I was there my friends steak Diane took longer than usual and a manager came to our table without prompting and told us dessert was on the house. Score!  Cons: I have no willpower over their cheesecake. Also pricey for a chain restaurant in the mall (IMO). And, it's in a mall. So parking is annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=240
Mark B.,"South Burlington, VT",117,112,1,3.0,10/28/2013,"In terms of chain restaurants, this is one of the better ones. The food is pretty consistent across locations, and is certainly better than Olive Garden and other choices. For the quantity of what they offer in choices, they make whatever you order off the menu, so clearly it's not mass produced in the midwest and flown in frozen packages to the restaurant.  I tend to favor Evelyn's Favorite pasta, and it turns out well. Sometimes I'll opt for something different, but each time the food was good. The breads are fresh as well, and the service in the Tyson's Galleria location is very good. Went recently and didn't have to wait for a table, and the service was just the right amount of attentive. The cheesecake is the signature item of course, and there are plenty to choose from.

I ordered sliders, which first, did not look appealing at ALL, and then ordered the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta which also wasn't flattering. Looked microwaved. The french bread was old. the appetizer was alright. It was a friend sushi dish (forgot the name). My experience was really bad.

Kristi J.,"Herndon, VA",47,48,35,5.0,12/11/2011,"Cheesecake Factory has been around for a while. I was surprised that there wasn't more than 1 review, but I will chalk it up to the fact that they've been around for so long, certainly most people know what they're getting into when they decide to go. For those of you that are reading this and aren't familiar with the restaurant, they have an extensive menu, and all the portions are huge. Most of the menu items are also pretty bad for you, but that's mostly due to the size. It's definitely a good place to come and split a meal. They have recently added a ""skinny"" menu, where everything featured on the menu is less than 590 calories. I like restaurants that do this, at least you know what you're getting yourself into. That being said, I've never had a bad meal here. I would say that all the dishes are above average (and above average size, but leftovers are good).  Although, you don't really come to the Cheesecake Factory because you want a healthy meal, you come for the Cheesecake, which NEVER disappoints. I particularly like their featured Cheesecakes. Every few months they come out with a new featured cheesecake. Some of the more notable ones in my opinion were the Pistachio Chocolate Chip and the Red Velvet Cheesecake. If neither of those sound good to you, I recommend the Dutch Apple Caramel Strussel or the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, which are a bit lighter. If neither of those tempt your pallet, don't worry, they have 37 different flavors to chose from, so I'm sure you can find something. I was VERY impressed with their latest feature this year which was the Peppermint Bark Cheesecake. Pretty fantastic, but I'm a sucker for peppermint bark.  You can also buy their Cheesecake by the slice or the whole cake to go. They're great for parties and get-togethers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=240

Drinks (the cosmo and mojitos) are typically strong there, but today was extremely weak and tasted like sugary juice. Our waiter was very helpful and worked to get that fixed.

The Jamaican black pepper shrimp is delicious.  It comes with plantains and rice. Jambalaya Chicken and Shrimp is also another favorite.

It is pretty dark as some others have said, but not so dark as it would cause any type of inconvenience. I got a burger and my wife got some type of Asian salad. She loved hers probably more than I did mine, but i was very pleased as well. The cheescake, although I can't quite remember which one we got, was fantastic, as you'd expect from this place.

For entrees we had the shrimp scampi with steak diane and the chicken maderia with steak diane. The steak on both dishes was really sweet, I was kinda hoping for something a bit more savory. The chicken tasted like what you would get on an airplane and the shrimp was pretty good. The only bright side from our night was the cheesecakes.

Overall,our server ALEM T.took great care of us,the food was delicious&,the price was very decent.The look of the place was very nice&CLEAN,&the staff was very pleasant.We will definitely be going back to TheCheesecakeFactory in Tysons Galleria,&we will be sure to ask for ALEM.Please be sure to ask for ALEM if you make TheCheesecakeFactory(Tysons Galleria)your next stop,you won't regret it&the food is just extra icing on the cake,the cheesecake that is. For my full review please continue reading below. ------------  We were in Virginia for a work/ vacation trip&wanted to find somewhere to eat.We called TheCheesecakeFactory ahead of time to ask if they accepted reservations which they only did for larger parties.We choose TheCheesecakeFactory at Tysons Galleria because we had already been to Tysons Corner the previous day&wanted to go&see the new Tysons,Tysons Galleria.We gave our taxi driver the address for the Cheese Cake Factory&ended up getting little lost,until we spotted the Neiman Marcus Dept.store sign after Tysons Corner.  We entered from curb side took the elevator&first thing we saw the dessert bar that displayed all 32 flavors of their Cheesecake specialties.We were not greeted at all probably by how late we had arrived it was 10:15pm&they closed at 11:00pm that evening.  We managed to find the hostess&thought that we were with another party until I asked ""a table for 2,please"".She escorted us to a booth near the bar&provided us with our menu&we asked her when last call was to order food,she responded with ""we close at 11 o'clock"".She did not portray a warm or friendly manner,but maybe she was just having a bad week(it was Monday).She then proceeded to remove the extra table settings(smart thinking).I think she might have said our serve will be with us shortly,but I could not recall truthfully.  I do remember ALEM greeting us as he made his way from the kitchen with another tables left overs.He said that he was our server&would be with us soon,which I can clearly recall.We had some time to look at our lengthy menu.We had time to take in the ambiance of the   looked classy almost high end which did not coincide with the very affordable pricing of our food.The design of the restaurant entrance seemed like that hotel lobby,with a fully stocked bar,&semi open kitchen only viewable if you are walking by but not from eye level while seated.We saw one of their appetizers(Avocado eggrolls)on display at their curb side entrance,&decided to order that along with their Portabella Mushroom Avocado&Zucchini Fries.ALEM greeted us&asked if we would like to start out with anything to drink,we ordered our appetizers first&could decide what to drink,we asked him what was popular on the menu because this was our first time.He suggested that he put in our appetizers&2 waters first so that he would have more time to go over the menu with us.He came back with our water&then went over the menu with us.He pointed out the drink selection referencing the page numbers for the drinks&the food orders.He pointed out some specialties like the ChickenMadeira,CajunJambalayaPasta which he was able to describe in detail.He also remarked that we could not leave without first trying on of their signature cheesecakes ""anyone of their 32 flavors"".  We decided to order the ChickenMadeira&Steak Diane&their CajunJambalayaPasta.He took our order&said he was going to check on our appetizers which should be out soon.He brought out our Avocado eggrolls,then later our Portabella Mushroom Avocado&Zucchini Fries.I liked the Fries We at them&the Avocado rolls were by far tastier than the Fries.ALEM came out a little later to tell us that our main course was ready early because it took a while for our appetizers to be prepared.He asked if it would be alright to bring that out now,I said it's fine since it was already 10:45pm.We received of main courses we were surprised by the large portions in comparison to the price($$).We really liked the Steak Diane; I liked the ChickenMadeira,&enjoyed the flavor&SPICE in the CajunJambalayaPasta.  We ordered the FreshBananaCreamCheesecake&the GodivaChocolateCheesecake.He brought us our desserts after he asked if we were ready for dessert since we only had a little bit of time to eat our main courses.We knew that we would be taking everything back to our hotel anyways.Dessert was delicious.   When our meal ended Alem chatted a little.He also recommended places nearby&asked us to stop by  -go boxes were Green.We had a great time most of the staff was friendly&2 different managers/ supervisors checked on us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=240

Katrina S.,"Springfield, VA",0,2,2,1.0,7/31/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory food but I will NEVER be returning to this location unless I'm forced to. Our dinner started out with extremely slow service. We were seated immediately but waited 15 minutes for a server to even greet us. I'm used to being offered bread as soon as the waiter greets us but we were offered none so we asked for some. No biggie, except for the fact that it took another 10-15 minutes to get our bread. Our server wasn't even the one who brought it out. We asked for more bread when we ran out but he didn't bring it by the time we got our entrees so we didn't bother asking again.  Now this is the kicker, when I received my meal (shrimp scampi and steak Diane combo) my portion was TINY. LIKE RIDICULOUSLY SMALL. I thought Cheesecake Factory was known for huge portion sizes? I had even asked the general size of a steak Diane when I ordered and the estimate he showed me was way bigger than what I got. My friend had also gotten a steak Diane combo and her portion was about twice the size of mine.  I'm not much for confrontation but I asked my friends if I should tell the waiter and they said yes. We tried to flag him down but he was literally nowhere to be found. We proceeded to stand up in our booth and try to flag down any other waiter but no one even looked at us, no joke. We decided to put the steak aside until we could find him and ask him about it. By the time he actually came by our table we were finished with everything except the steak. I pointed out the portion difference as politely as I possibly could because I didn't want him to think I was blaming him (it's not like the waiter controls how the food is cooked). He said he could see what I was saying and what I would like to do. I told him a few more pieces of steak would be perfect, just enough so mine and my friends portion sizes were even. He said he would go and try to get me some (which I appreciated) and left to the kitchen.  When he came back he finally gave us the bread we were waiting for (took him long enough) then told me the most bullshit excuse ever. He said ""what had happened was they weighed the portions but I'll bring you out some more anyways"". Now this pissed me off. At the very least they could apologize then bring me the extra steak but no, instead they acted as if I was seeing things and nothing was wrong. I asked my friends if our portions looked even close to the same weight and they said absolutely not it was an obvious lie. This alone made my dinner the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER. I can't stand for companies who blame their customers for problems and make lame excuses to save their asses. I got my extra pieces of steak in the end but I was already annoyed. If you want slow service and to be ripped off with extremely small portion sizes then blamed for it, come here. If not go to the Potomac mills location or fair oaks, they have some of the best costumer service ever. I don't know why tysons is so lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=60

I always have trouble with their tome of a menu, so many options, but recently I've fallen in love with the fried spicy chicken sandwich, minus the spice, plus some blue cheese.  The only thing I do recommend is ordering cheesecake AT YOUR TABLE. I made the mistake of waiting until we were leaving to order it from the to-go cheesecake counter at the front, and I must have waited half an hour for a guy to take a slice of cheesecake out of the fridge and put it into a box: when I was the only one there.

Sana S.,"Sterling, VA",199,169,315,1.0,10/29/2015,"Went there for a birthday lunch with 5 of my coworkers. We were seated promptly, but it all went downhill from there.  Our server Rahul, was very forgetful. I had to ask at least 3 times for bread and each time he reacted as if he had never heard me say it before. After about 15 minutes he finally brought us our bread and water, which he had to make multiple trips for. Not sure what the delay was, the restaurant was not packed at all and the other servers around us seemed to be more responsive to their tables.  It took another 20 minutes before the drinks we ordered arrived. Then, we sat for 40 minutes waiting for our food to come, I had to go up to the hostess and ask for a manager because the wait time was just ridiculous.  The manager appologized stating that one of the orders, a burger was overcooked. Regardless I don't understand how that would result in 40 minutes. We watched parties who had arrived after us eat and leave before us, that's how slow the service was for our table. Finally the food came out, but not even all of it. Two plates at a time with about 10 minutes in between. All of our entrees were freezing cold and had clearly been sitting under the heat lamps as they were slightly warm on the surface. We refused to eat our meals. The mananger came over and was extremely flustered. He had no idea how to handle the situation and at one point walked away while I was speaking to him. Not only that, but he reiterated and became frustrated that we were complaining since he had told us about the burger needing to be recooked. He later offered to remake our meals, but after an hour and half wasted, we just had zero patience or desire to eat there anymore. He stated he would take all of the food off our bill and that we were only responsible for the drinks. Took another 15 minutes for the check to come and for the server to process it, we were so frustrated that we almost walked out.  Upon leaving, the server offered us a slice of cheescake. I politely refused. A complimentary slice of cheescake does not make up for the 2 hours wasted.  Thanks Cheescake Factory for your extremely poor service and managment. I wish I had gotten the managers name, but I have no idea how he can run a restaurant, I have never experienced such poor managment skills, or honestly lack there of. Also, thanks for not only ruining my birthday lunch, but lunch hour for 5 of my coworkers.

I've gotten nothing but spotty or surly service here. We don't want cheesecake for dessert or to-go after our meal? Our server got mad at us and stormed off to get the check. Meanwhile, I was admiring the next table's ultra-professional server. With an attitude like that, I'd rather just buy the cheesecake directly from the cake window.  The service at the cake display window is top notch. At least that made up for the food service.  Also, the ThyssenKrupp hydraulic elevators are pretty nice to experience, and convenient (and snazzy, i guess) to get to the restaurant from the main level.  At their cheesecake slice prices, though, I'd consider other dessert options within the mall. Update: I tried the Salted Caramel cheesecake, per recommendation. It's definitely the best one of their seemingly endless selection. The other ones just seem to be either sugar bombs, other flavors than cheesecake, etc. From now on I won't even bother testing my blood sugar with any other potential flops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=60
Bob T.,"Arlington, VA",90,225,267,1.0,9/26/2015,"It has been a long time since I ate at a Cheesecake Factory.  Thanks to this meal it will be longer still before I try again. There were four of us, three adults and my 7-year old daughter.  None of us walked away having enjoyed anything we ordered. The food is still dished out in portions so generous as to border on the absurd.  However, the flavors and presentation were anywhere from bland to yucky.  For example, my bacon bacon cheeseburger (not a typo, it has two different kinds of bacon) tasted just OK.  I finished it and would not order it again.  My desert, a Warm Apple Crisp, was a gummy mess.  Nothing about it was the least bit crispy.  The only thing differentiating the apples, ""crisps"", and ice cream was the temperature.  I could only stomach a few bites and would never consider ordering it again.   The thing that pushed the meal over the edge, plummeting towards atrociousness, was my daughter's dessert.  She wanted the 7-layer chocolate cake, and I couldn't see plopping something that huge in front of a child.  So, I asked the waiter to serve her half and put the rest in a box.  He brought it to our table as the entire slice in a box.   When I asked him about it, he said serving the cake as an entire slice was a presentation issue and the kitchen staff refused to cut it in half as I requested.  When I spoke to the manager, he said the same thing. Between the (at best) mediocre food and a host of other service issues the meal already stank.  This last thing, refusing a perfectly reasonable request, was just icing on what turned out to be an overly-sweetened and otherwise flavorless piece of cake. I also noticed something a bit underhanded.  If you split the check and don't stop to think you will be overtipping... big time.  Their credit card slips come with three pre-calculated tip amounts to save the effort of calculating the tip.  The problem is if you ask them to split the charge between credit cards, the calculated tips provided are still against the original total.  For example, my credit card slip was for $53 and the ""Suggested Gratuity"" of 20% was listed at $21.20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=60

Julie K.,"Springfield, VA",2,24,5,2.0,3/26/2017,"I wouldn't recommend this Cheesecake Factory for a large group especially if it's a birthday. We went in at 8:30 last night Saturday night, 15 of us. And we waited around an hour and half I believe. But we weren't bothered by that at all we understood that it was busy and it's hard to find a large table like that at that time. Also the hosts was extremely nice she kept us updated on our table, and we really appreciated that. So after we got our table our server came by I didn't see him greet anyone just started taking drinks orders. He looked tired and had a long day and he looked busy. So he got the drinks order took about 15 minutes to get us waters he got drinks for half the table and left the other half until he remembered. He wasn't very attentive barely came to check up on us I got frustrated a little and told him we are ready to order now. So he took our orders and left. My friend tried to call on him while he's walking by and asked him ""excuse me sir can I get"" and the server replied ""yeah yeah"" and kept walking away he didn't even stop to ask what he wanted and didn't even let him finish what he wanted. My friend wanted more bread, he brought out the bread after a while, didn't even ask if we needed butter and ran off. The drinks from the bar took around 30 minutes to come out. By the time we got our food everyone was starving. I got the chicken Riesling that was on the speciality it was amazing. But the disappointing part was our server didn't come around and check if we wanted parmesan cheese and did ask how our food was, I know one person on the table didn't like their pasta much.  So my friend kept calling on him saying ""hey sir can we please get some Parmesan cheese"" my friend asked him twice because of how he never came to our table but to just take orders. So the server reply okay with a little attitude and while he was walking away he shook his head at us! Like seriously!! I wasn't sure who's serving whom at that moment. I had 3 years serving experience and never seen such a rude server! I would've not wrote this review if he didn't shake his head at us, because I understand how tough the job can be. If he was at least nice and smiling more often and saying sorry for the delays we would've totally understood. I would've spoken to a manager and made it a big deal but it was my friends birthday so I kept quite just didn't want any distractions from her time. It was getting frustrating because we waited so long to get a table and half of us were starving and it just wasn't worth the wait.

We came to eat at The Cheesecake Factory for a coworker's birthday and left with a bitter taste in our mouths. One of our coworkers ordered a Luau salad and was given a completely different salad. We asked our waitress (Yadira?) why this salad is different and she said that they don't have the Luau salad and so she ordered one based on what she thinks our coworker would like. No apologies or anything and she just kept insisting we keep the salad we chose. After we asked for a new salad, she looked upset, but ended up giving us what we asked for. We then asked for her to bring out a cheesecake for a surprise birthday treat and she said that she got us. She came later with a dinky shot glass of whipped cream with a candle. I asked her what happened to the cheesecake and she said that this is what they usually give for birthdays. However, we ASKED for a cheesecake from the very beginning. She laughed and said how funny the shot glass looks and just walked away. Incredible. Btw she called one of our male coworkers ma'am 3 times for some reason even one time after we mentioned that to her that he is a male. Also, when we left she charged us for the original salad then double charged on accident and then charged us the correct amount making one credit card have three big dinners' worth out of their account until the refunds came back.

Donald P.,"Washington, DC",273,1298,1430,5.0,6/29/2010,"I don't know what it is, but for some reason I HATE the idea of coming here. it's almost always on the bottom of my list. Some 10 years ago when I first heard about the Cheesecake Factory, I just thought it was another overpriced place for food snobs that like to pay a fortune and nibble on a few pieces of lettuce...probably because some of my friends were exactly that and ""raved"" about this place. Anyway to make a long story short, the few times I've been to The Cheesecake Factory at various locations, I've always been very impressed with the food, the price, and now...the decor. I can't believe we haven't tried this location earlier. When we stepped in, it almost felt like I was walking into a casino or something. Everything just felt ornate and very high end...which isn't surprising since it's at Tysons II, but compared to our longtime favorite -- Maggiano's -- it's the difference between night and day. Maggiano's has an older rustic ambiance, whereas Cheesecake Factory feels modern, trendy, hip. I guess the only other thing this place was lacking was the slot machines. Anyway the other reason I seem for forget is that their menu is very extensive. I guess their strategy is to appeal to EVERYONE so there's no reason not to go. For a chain restaurant, very few places come to mind that would compare. The eating experience here is just top notch. And the fact that this place is baby friendly makes it that much easier for us to go to...although the baby changing station was not very clean.

Addy C.,"Atlanta, GA",1046,878,4291,4.0,3/22/2010,"Yes, I'm reviewing Cheesecake Factory. I don't care if there are Yelpers are out there who are thinking why's this girl rating a chain restaurant. I think their food is still Yelp-worthy, and I love their cheesecake.  Actually the reason we picked this place is b/c we wanted our friend who recently had a baby choose the place - she picked Cheesecake Factory not only b/c she loves the food but b/c the place is noisy, and as new moms know, they feel more comfortable taking their babies (or young ones) to a noisy restaurant. Plus Tyson's Corner is a great central location as a couple of us were coming from Maryland, and the other two from Virginia. This place is also great for groups with varied tastes - their menu is HUGE. It's also great for big & small eaters - the portions are HUGE so big eaters can leave satisfied, and small eaters (& frugal eaters like me) have enough food to make two meals :) Great time to go is before 5pm b/c they have lunch specials - and portions are still HUGE. I got the ""Pasta Da Vinci"" for $10.95 b/c it was our server's favorite, and shortly thereafter found out it was one of my friend's favorites, too. This dish has penne pasta w/ sauteed chicken and mushrooms & onions in Madeira wine sauce. It was a little on the sweet side but I love sweet so it was perfect for me. Other dishes I tasted were the ""Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta"" (loved this too - I love cream sauce, and I'd get this next time), ""Four Cheeese Pasta"" (pretty good), ""Sweet Corn Tamale"" (good for sharing), and ""Fried Calamari"" (good but didn't care for the ""cocktail sauce"" as their choice for dipping sauce).  For dessert, got the special promo ""Red Velvet Cheesecake"" - no description needed, except for this cheesecake only, $.25 goes toward the ""Feeding America"" organization. Why just $.25 and why just the Red Velvet ... seems like they could've applied their generosity more but who am I to judge. A slice of cheesecake is a little pricey at $7.50 but easily shared among 4 people.  Overall 3.5 stars rounded to 4 b/c of great service, great variety of menu selections, generous portions, reasonable prices, convenient location.

Sarah F.,"Fairfax, VA",57,32,7,1.0,10/22/2015,"We had a really disappointing experience at the Tyson's location tonight. For starters, the restaurant was absolutely freezing, and we were sat directly behind a server station where servers found it appropriate to discuss tips and customers directly in front of us. Further, the other server in our station was laughing, shouting, and clapping so loudly you would have thought he was at a standup comedy show. Our server, on the other hand, seemed half awake, and dropped the ball on several items. We specifically asked for a soup entree to split, followed by another entree to split. We were then served one bowl of soup (with no soup spoons). We waited several minutes to ask our server for an extra bowl and soup spoons, but she was nowhere to be found, so we gave up and attempted to share it across the table with our teaspoons. Several waitstaff passed us clearly looking like we needed something, and nobody checked in. Then, our second entree arrived (orange chicken, also on a single plate rather than split as requested) and when our server finally brought us an extra plate, it was completely filthy and covered in what appeared to be crusted over olive oil. The chicken was beyond disappointing, and my husband almost swallowed a hunk of bone in on of the pieces. We told the server and pointed out the bone, but she didn't offer to bring a replacement entree, nor did a manager come by. Of all the times to at LEAST do a table touch, that would have been it. The only saving grace for the meal was the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake, which was very good. Honestly, a decent meal with good service should not be that difficult.

Glenn C.,"Reston, VA",54,118,3,2.0,4/4/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a perfect example of a jack of all trades and a master of none. I've never left here saying ""man, I can't wait to come back."" The menu is the size of a book, offering literally every type of cuisine I can think for. There's pasta, pizza, proteins of all kinds, soups, salads, tacos, curry, asian-inspired dishes, nachos, wings, noodles, and even more that I cannot honestly remember. Then of course there are the cheesecakes, which come in what must be 500 different flavors. When a restaurant tries to include anything you could possibly be in the mood for, they insure that it won't be expertly prepared. How can any kitchen possibly master so many dishes from so many different branches of the culinary art? The answer is they can't, and that inability shows itself when it arrives at your table. Of course, their big claim to fame are their cheesecakes. I'm not saying that they're terrible, but for a restaurant to name itself after one signature dish, it had better be perfect, or as close to it as possible. Alas, yet again the Factory lets itself down. True cheesecake, the kind you'll find in a real New York delicatessen, doesn't come in dozens of different flavors, and it's also nowhere near the consistency you'll find here. Cheesecake should be firm yet creamy, and the crust shouldn't factor in nearly as much as Cheesecake Factory makes it. The last time I visited, I had a flank steak that was overcooked and nowhere near as tender as it should have been- and we're talking about flank steak here, not filet. I don't blame the chefs getting it wrong. Combining the size of the menu with how cavernously large the dining room is, they must be under constant attack from 5:30 until close. It always makes me scratch my head how people will wait an hour or more for a table here when there are dozens of far superior restaurants within a mile radius. Save yourself a wait and a uninteresting dinner, and choose any one of those better eateries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=260

You get a half sandwich, cup of soup and a small salad, which is a normal salad. This is Cheesecake Factory, after all. The chicken walnut salad sandwich was quite good, with thick, toasted and buttered bread and a shocking amount of flavor. The cream of chicken soup had thick chunks of white meat chicken and plenty of fresh vegetables. The salad was simple, just spinach leaves and vinaigrette, but it served as a proper side. Surprisingly, there's no vegan cheesecake on their dessert menu. I have a cousin who's lactose intolerant, and he was forced to watch (cruelly) as we all devoured original and banana cheesecakes.

We also had the Grande Burrito, and sadly it also shrank, we received a half of what it used to be.   Then they pour tomato sauce on top, and inside instead of the rice and cilantro sauce it was tomato sauce inside.  We were charged $15 for Mini Burritos and $13 for the not so beefy hamburger. The Cheesecake ingredients had dropped dramatically, instead of fresh cream they are using vegetable oil, vegetable shortening.  We got sick of them and their Carrot Cake crumbles although frozen.  Not Acceptable for the prices charged.

We ordered the lemon-ricotta pancakes, which were absolutely DEEE-LICIOUS!  Reminded me of the delicious lemon-ricotta pancakes I had at BLD in Los Angeles (which was featured on Food Network's 'Best Thing I Ever Ate').  I would definitely come back for brunch to eat these again. Also ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad...I know, I know fish and pancakes don't go that well together.  But, the salad dressing was on point.  The avocado it came out with was miserable-looking but I let it go because hey, it's winter on the East Coast...I'm sure it's hard to get good looking avocados at this time.  The salad overall tasted good but was very overprice at almost $17.

She said once I'm done walking around to just check back with them to see if the pager is still activated. We all walked around, we went back and my wife went to ask them.

I wasn't even going to write this thing because I don't want to trash restaurants on here, particularly chains which is very much a ""you know what you're getting into when you come here"" thing.  But a bunch of basic steps in the world of service were completely ignored here.  A birthday group of 9 shows up at 5 and leaves after 8:30 and not because their casually hanging out just enjoying the decor and the coffee?  That's INSANE. Took three trips from this guy to get full drink orders.  He missed out on his chance to sell dessert because he randomly rang in only two people's orders and then just dissapeared.  He took leftoever food away from the table to box it himself in some hidden corner of the restaurant, carrying dirty plates from fellow table members over top of this food to be brought home and even proceeded to go to another table with it to answer a random person's question, with my food just leaning in on their table where there food is?  Come on. The worst offense was the check though.  Not establishing at the beginning that there were going to be seperate checks, this guy brings us the check, tells us to number 1, 2, 3, 4 on each order so they know how to seperate it and then write who's card is who's for each number!  Comes back what mustve been a seriously legitimate ten minutes later (felt like 20) and presented us with the seperated checks to make sure they were done right....then went away again to physically ring up the check?  Come on now man....this guy was gone for ANOTHER 10 minutes.  Nice kid, but flighty as all get out without a lick of ability to multitask - Granted he was busy, but his mistakes started early on.  When my sister in law told him she couldn't decide between a shot of patron or a margarita, he sat there and waited for her response.  She then said - You know what, put the patron IN the margarita, everyone laughed and with her drink only (three mojito's and sodas and stuff were ordered at this point as well) comes by with a shot of patron.....and then tells her that the margarita is coming shortly........???????  Oh, not a maragarita pure per say, but one without tequila for her to add her own as .... she desired?????  Or something that made no damn sense lol.  Birthday girl, we ask the guy if there are cheesecakes that are key lime....he says yes - Someone then goes - wait wait wait, anything with coconut?  The waiter says, there's a Khalua Coconut (we flip cause Khalua is the birthday girls favorite liqueur and she's a freak for coconut so double whammy) - waiter says great - comes back with a slice of key lime cheese cake with a candle in it......What the hell kind of mess????? My wife and I order a chicken caesar salad to split....never split, no extra plate until everybody else's food came out which was all seperate and crazy, apparently spinach was being waited on for someone's crab cake dish and this caused mayhem.  Finally get the plate, split the caesar salad - expected that generic garlicy, cheesey, creamy chicken flavor you get from all caesar salads....which for the most part we did get...until I get slapped by a sweetness, definitely like a terriyaki sauce.....investigate the plate further and underneath the salad, is a healthy dollop of terriyaki sauce.  Not only interesting because that's not something you find in a traditional caesar salad, but odd too because no one at the table had anything terriyaki so it wasn't spill from another plate.  Which means I was served a caesar salad that definitely was either dirty and not washed previously, or was plated with terriyaki and then just disregarded to swap that platte out and put a caesar salad on top of it anyway???????  When presented to the server, he apologizes about it, brings out a new one after everyone else finishes their meal.  no manager follow up, had to not only pay for both this salad and the dessert we ordered, but we also had to pay for the birthday girl cheesecake, you know, the one we didn't request! Place is a huge mess man, it's not just the server, it's the management of how service is conducted and it goes as far as back to the kitchen, cause that plate error, no expiditor on a line would've been able to see, that was the mistake of the whoever was responsible at the salad station, the manager should've been made aware of the problems to offer further assistance at the table and the server should've pre labled every seat so he could've swiftly saved us from that last hour playing this seperation game / follow up check order.  Just awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=260

This is not acceptable to me as she not once acknowledged that her waiter brought the food out to me without looking over it to ensure quality. The roach was not hidden under lettuce or anything it was literally belly up back stroking in the wonton sauce. I'm appalled. I shouldn't know about your agreements or guarantees with your pest company that's not my business and its your responsibility on behalf of the customer. Not theirs.

I ordered the Neapolitan pasta, which on the menu sounded great - bacon, pepperoni, meatballs, peppers, garlic, etc. in tomato sauce over a parmesan cream pasta. What I got tasted like it had been scraped off the bottom of a pan where it had been burnt. There were no meatballs, I couldn't even tell what some of the things were int it, and there was no sauce, just a congealed paste. There was very little sauce (which may be a good thing) covering a lot of spaghetti. It was the beginning of lunch,  hardly anyone was there, so it wasn't due to an overcrowded kitchen.

I drop by here often for lunch while shopping with my parents, as they have a wide-ranged menu where everyone can find something for themselves. Most of their food is mediocre at best in my personal opinion, but their new ""superfood"" salad section seems very promising and I do enjoy some of their pastas (louisiana, angel hair with shrimp, jambalaya) as I don't eat pasta at home often.

But this server had no experience or didn't know what he was doing.  I always come to this restaurant and never had a problem. But unfortunately yesterday I came with a group of close friends to celebrate the arrival of my baby girl. We all had a bad experience we wanted to walk out because we waited for water and our drinks for about 20-25 minutes. Later our appetizers came late then our other appetizer came 20 mins later. We had to tell our server that we didn't get our appetizer. He not once bother to check up on us. Don't know what he was doing but horrible service. Afterwards we waited an hour and a half for our food. Our food order was not hard at all. It was ridiculous that he did not even bother to check on the food. Then my friends again ordered 2 mojitos and once again it took another 20/25 minutes to come out. We were so upset we didn't even wanna order cheesecake because that was going to take another 30 minutes.! I honestly felt bad for him because he lacked in training I still tipped him but not the amount he deserved. Regardless he knew he messed up and did not do a good job he didn't even offer a discount on our bill. This will be the last time I come to this restaurant.

Ihita K.,"Silver Spring, MD",203,309,501,3.0,4/15/2015,"Having a workplace located next to Tysons Galleria means your lunch options are relegated to like a total of 5 places in the mall .. bah humbug. Cheesecake Factory is one of them, and having the ability to seat large parties, I've had more corporate lunches and dinners at this establishment than my nonchainliking self would prefer. That being said, I have a mild obsession with Louisiana Chicken Pasta (w/ extra mushrooms, always) .. it just never fails me. Simple bow tie pasta with parmesan crusted chicken served with mushrooms, peppers and nnions in a ""spicy"" ""New Orleans"" sauce. The quotes are due to the fact that while delicious, and addictive, it is never actually spicy so I always ask for crushed red peppers, and as a frequent visitor and lover of Nola .. I can promise you that there's nothing authentic about this sauce. But it's still good I promise! If you happen to in the mall during the day time and don't find yourself with a job to hurry back to, try out their happy hour from 3:30 pm to 6:00 pm. Or if you happen to work in the area and your job causes you to want to imbibe early in the day, it works for that too .. not that I'm speaking from experience or anything. 0:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=80

Our beet salad, ranch barbecue and cobb salads were good. TIP: Lunch size is a generous meal.  We also ordered the fried calamari appetizer--fresh but bland without the hot sauce, just like the equally fresh Thai wrap appetizer served with 3 dipping sauces.

They carded me.   OK, if you're a guy...or is still in your early 20's, you have no idea why this is a big deal.  But let's just say that the last time I was carded, everyone was worried about the Y2K bug. So imagine having a tragically sucky day at work...then dragging your butt to Cheesecake Factory for a networking function.  You head to the bar and wonder if it would make a bad impression on your industry peers if you asked the bartender to just stick a straw into that bottle of Johnny Walker Black...when the bartender asks to see your ID.  In complete seriousness...and with a little suspicion in his eyes as if he's wise to your fake ID ways. YES!  Suddenly, the skies opened up, the sun came out, and I was again my fun, energetic, semi-witty self.  HURRAH! For anyone who has not eaten at Cheesecake Factory before, the food is decent.  It's not exceptionally good (they tend to over-season the meat dishes, and drown their salads in dressing), but it's not bad either.  The food is decent, and the portions are *HUGE*.  One great thing about evil-chain restaurants is that if you've been to one, you can basically expect the same quality of food everywhere and CF is habitually solid.  I must admit that there is a certain amount of comfort in having that type of predictability.  Also, while I've had better cheesecake at many other places, I do adore the large slices and the nice wide variety in flavors. So in a nutshell, it's a Cheesecake Factory like all other Cheesecake Factories...but they have a suspicious bar-staff that makes for a GREAT pick-me-up when you're feeling blue and low and not quite as young and peppy as you once were.  Heh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=320

The fish tacos were AWFUL. The fish was disguising. The fish I bit into was grey and hard. -The waiter charged me for the dinner salad when I ordered the lunch salad (he corrected the charge after I pointed it out to him) -He didn't give us any sort of discount for messing up the order and extending our lunch by an extra half hour.

Cheesecake Factory is always fine - service is always fine, food is always fine, but I feel like it's one of those places where I always look forward to going, then am not as impressed when I leave. This time, I had the Giant Burrito.  I don't know what it's called but it's Giant, so that's what I'm going to call it.  It comes on an oval plate... and the thing itself is about a foot long (not kidding) smothered in this yummy sauce (I have no godly idea what it was) and pico de gallo.  It came with a side dish of sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole (the guac was really good). Inside, it had chicken, onions, rice, peppers, and I don't know what else; but I asked for no beans (can't stand em).   It was good.  Definitely nowhere near El Paso-caliber burritos, but for not being a Mexican place, it was definitely decent.  Where it lacked in flavor, it compensated with sheer size... ha! In the past, I've gotten the lettuce wraps (they're an appetizer but they make a great meal) and they're great.  I've also gotten the Thai Chicken Pasta which is always satisfying and really good.  Last time boyfriend went, he got the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - but when I saw it at the restaurant yesterday (someone at the next table got it), it didn't look that impressive... almost icky-looking, so I went with the Burrito and I think I'm glad. My gripe about Cheesecake Factory:  The menu is a freakin' novel.  What am I supposed to do with 150 pages of drinks, appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts?!  It's so overwhelming that I usually stick to the same few things and don't venture because that menu stresses me out! Overall, service is decent, food is good, and you're probably not going to get better cheesecake anywhere around here... so, I'd go back.

I ran late...that darn lengthy drive from Western Loudoun County.  So my party had settled in with tea, water, diet coke and an order of artichoke spinach dip/chips.  It was ok, but seriously not home made. We ordered the chicken enchiladas and crispy chicken dish that was a dead ringer for sesame chicken.  I swear the serving of rice was moulded in a soup bowl so had to be at least a 1+ cup serving.  More doesn't equal better. The tastes overall were acceptable, but the black beans were dried out and the cilantro rice was not flavorful as I expected.   We didn't bother with dessert.   For me Cheesecake Factory is above the trough-food quality of an all you can eat buffet, but the mechanics behind it feels strangely synergistic around that type of delivery.  I say offer fewer options to allow for more attention to quality.  The service today was spot on, which is a hit or miss most of the time.   My joy today was that the meeting was outstanding!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=320

Alexandra M.,"Charlotte, NC",41,266,11,4.0,12/4/2008,"like i have said in previous reviews, i am not one to review about chain restaurants or the like unless i must warn the publics or tell them to come. i am a fan of the cheesecake factory in general, but i think this has to be my favorite location. i hate going on weekends or early afternoon because i dont usually think its THAT worth the wait, but then i sit down, take one look at the menu and remember that it is. however, the day that they finally take reservations i will be completely ecstatic. i dont know if its me, but the service usually always seems to be lacking no matter if youre at the cheesecake factory in dulles, providence, fairoaks, or tysons (the 4 that i have been to). well, we went just the other day for a late lunch around 4. our waitress was one of the nicest people, she was very attentive and let us be when we needed to be and was just very personable. probably the BIGGEST problem with the cheesecake factory is the seating. i dont know/cant remember if they have the chair/table/long bench seating at this location but at the other 3 locations there has been numerous occasions where i am sitting so close to the other person i become tempted to ask them what they bought at the mall or what perfume they are wearing. REQUEST A BOOTH, every time. we even lied and said we were a party of 3 one time in hopes that we didnt have to sit in those God-awful chairs. my boyfriend and i usually try to order something different everytime we go.  this specific time they had the BAR MENU/SMALL PLATES. genius. it is genius.  i dont remember seeing one plate on the bar menu that was over $5. we order the small plate of potstickers (4 for $2.95) and the small chopped salad (a staple). in addition we ordered the buffalo blasts, if you go, get them, they are an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth.  we also tried the japanese vegetable and blue cheese pizza. we have never had their pizza and we were definitely surprised. we NEVER come to the cheescake factory and not get cheesecake. i dont care if im on a diet or not (which i usually 'try' to be but who am i kidding?) we got the peanut butter ripple to go. i figure its not as bad if we split it...right? some of my favorite dishes: -chopped salad -chicken madeira -fried mac & cheese (app) -buffalo blasts (app) -sesame chicken -factory nachos (app BUT HUGE and definitely enough for dinner) my favorite cheesecake is the banana as well as the apple pie cheesecake. the greatest thing about the cheesecake factory is you always leave full and have food for a midnight munchie or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=340

Bryant Z.,"McLean, VA",28,65,29,4.0,8/3/2008,"If you dig through my other reviews, you'll see a trend: I love burgers. So I got this location's ""Tons of Fun"" burger (as I do with their other locations if I don't get their [perpetual] fish of the day). I wasn't surprised when this burger wasn't well done. However, the lighting in the restaurant, as with all of TCF's other locations, was dark and rather serene. I had to crack out my LED torch to confirm what my taste buds had suspected: The burger was rare. So I sent it back. Our European transfer-student-of-a-waitress was very sweet and promptly took the meal back. Literally within less than a minute's time, the location's manager came to me and profusely apologized for the error, followed by asking what I would like them to do to make up for the mistake. I insisted that they do what's most convenient for them, which would have been to finish cooking the burger (as it is at other locations). Instead, they brought a brand new burger, added a full dish of fries to what I had left (half of the original dish), and gave me a free dessert! Something tells me if a bunch of you try this on purpose, they won't do it again, so please don't spoil it for those of us who actually do have to recover from a misconfigured order. Yes, I'm talking to you. I'm not talking to the other people reading this review; I'm talking *directly* to you. Don't assume that others will listen to me, thus leaving you free to copy what I did, because that's not how it works. You need to listen: don't rip customer service off.

Recently, I have found one dish that I will stick to getting every time, and that would be the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad (I uploaded it to the gallery above)! It is just delightful! It's the closest to sushi you could get at Cheesecake Factory. The tuna is perfectly seasoned and the wasabi vinaigrette just completes the whole dish. It's also probably one of the healthier dishes here! Definitely, try it! The service at this location is pretty bizarre. I mean, the waiter was nice and very prompt, but confused the heck out of me! So I placed my order for the salad and a few moment later the manager came back to my table to tell me that the tuna is not ready yet and won't be prepared for another 20 minutes but I didn't mind because I was there already so might as well wait. A few moments later another manager came back to tell me that they don't have tuna at all that day, and gave me the menu to look at again...so I was like, okay nevermind I don't want anything because I don't like anything else there.  A few moments later again that same manager came back and said that they do have tuna and it won't be ready for another 10 minutes...okay I hoped that that would be the final time they come to deliver bad news.......So then it came out, about 10 minutes later, and it was delicious! Worth the wait and all. When the bill came, they didn't charge me the salad because it took them so long to make it!!

You usually get ice cream or some treat, right? They sprayed whipped cream on a small plate, threw a few sprinkles on it and brought it out.

The Mahi Mahi was perfectly seasoned and grilled, it was a bit dry but I honestly had no problem with it. After all, fish is not the juiciest meat. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 4 is because the service was terribly slow. Now given it was busy and we had a large group, a lunch should not take two hours.

But I've never had a meal at the cheesecake factory and thought it was REALLY GOOD. It was, at best, slightly above average. My mom, grandma, aunt, cousin and my sister (six of us) went to have dinner.  We had a large lunch so we ordered five dishes and shared. We had the Luau Salad, Chicken Madeira, Herb Crusted Salmon (from their ""skinny"" selection), Da Vinci Pasta and Fettuccine with Sundried Tomatoes. Out of all the dishes we ordered, my favorite was the chicken madeira. But I think it's pretty hard to screw up a dish with broiled chicken and cheese, asparagus and mashed potatoes. The herb crusted salmon tasted no different from what i make it home and the two pastas were slightly overcooked. The worst part was that not all of our dishes came out at the same time.  My sister (who ordered the fettuccine)'s dish came out later and at that point the rest of us were almost done with our entrees.

They don't charge:) 4. Chicken hash: again big portion and good flavor but not wow-special. I will return soon for more:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=200

Liv P.,"McLean, VA",3,23,47,1.0,2/23/2015,"Huge fan of cheesecakes here- Called in today to place an order for 10inch strawberry cheesecake- I was running around all day so I was expecting my cheesecake to be READY when I get there. A guy name Danny was helping me and he asked me what kind of cheesecake I ordered. I said it and he goes I have to wait 4min. I asked him is it not ready- He talks back to me ""we don't make cheesecakes until the customer shows up, lots of times they don't show up and we have to waste them"" ......What? Really? Why the hell did you even take my order through the phone at the first place? If I knew it wasn't gonna be ready when I get there, I would've came earlier because I was running late. I was literally standing there for 15min for the cheesecake to be ready. I glanced over it and they were running out of strawberries so they used the tiniest left over strawberries and I was so mad. When the other guy was making it, he was giggling and chatting with the girl employee rather than making my cheesecake asap. So unprofessional. Employees need some improvements with the manners and professionalism.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=200
Amanda G.,"Alexandria, VA",6,6,,1.0,1/13/2014,"I used to come to the Cheesecake factory a lot, but after this past visit, I will not eat at this location again. My mother, boyfriend, and I came here after a long day at Tysons II. We saw that the restaurant was not too busy so we figured it would be another good experience here; but it wasn't. First, our appetizers came out before our drinks. Second, it took well over 25 minutes to get a refill. Third, it took about an hour for the food to come out, may I remind you the restaurant was not busy. Four, when the food came out, it was not all together and was missing multiple side items and parts of the entree. Five, my food came out 15 minutes after my moms and boyfriends. I had ordered pasta and when I got to it, it was cold. Lastly, my boyfriend's catfish was not fully cooked and was raw on the inside.   I ended up going to the hostess stand to let the manager know about our experience and of course he did not have much to say. He disappeared for a while and when he finally came to our table he did not do much to resolve the issues. We ended up calling the corporate number and never got the chance to speak to someone nor got a call back.  I will definitely never eat at this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=200
Teresa B.,"Pasadena, CA",440,304,466,5.0,9/1/2013,"I know what to expect when opting to eat at a ""chain"" restaurant, and this location totally met my expectations. No matter where I am travelling, from coast-to-coast, I am always happy with my experience at a Cheesecake Factory. The first thing I do is check the cheesecake options on display. Not that I always order a piece, yet I am comforted to know that I can have their lo-carb version at any location. Whether it be in Pasadena or Glendale, in California. Or at White Plains, NY, and even at a recent visit to my new neighborhood location in NOVA (Northern Virginia), I am always hooked on ordering the same thing. I generally plan my experience to be on a Sunday, mid-afternoon. I always order their Mushroom Burger. A ""Great Glamburger® Challenge Winner! With lots of Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Mayo, Covered with Melted Swiss and Fontina Cheese"".  I order it without a bun, and with a salad. And since it's around brunch time, I also order a side of two eggs, over medium. In any location, it's never been a problem to fulfill my request, and I savor every bite. At this location, my Boo tried their version of a California Cheesesteak: Thinly Sliced Grilled Steak Covered with Sautéed Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers and Cheese on Our Toasted Sourdough Loaf.

I will never come to this location after that...wouldn't it make more sense and more polite if we reserved a certain time and ask those people kindly that they have someone reserved for this table after them? Awesome food but very horrible service for your reservations here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=200
Lindsey H.,"Burke, VA",24,24,21,1.0,2/7/2015,"Our server was ricky. My parents arrived 20 minutes before my fiance and I. They already had drinks when we arrived but they were empty. So I figured the staff would see new people at the table and stop by. It took 20 minutes for them to come to the table. I ordered a soda and a cocktail, the cocktail which I waited another 20 minutes for, having to flag down and remind the server, which by this point we had almost received our food. I'm a light drinker and appreciate drinking my cocktail throughout the whole dining experience, not having to chug it all at once to get it in before I leave. I expect it get within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering. He didnt even ask if there was anything else he could get us, refills, bread, nothing, so inefficient .  While ordering food, my mother asked a question about the style of sauce a pasta dish came with- instead of finishing the order and finding out after, then coming back to confirm- the server turned his back and walked away from the table!  My fiance WANTED to order a chicken sandwich but wanted his sauce on the side, the waiter acted like he was stupid, pressing him to order something else that HE HIMSELF thought he should order, finally my fiance gave in and ordered the chicken littles to avoid further argument and frustrations. Maybe suggest something but don't force a change of mind on a customer.  My pasta alfredo- A watered down, broken/split (oil separated from milk product) supposed ""parmesan"" sauce/liquid which tasted of raw garlic, burning on my lips. There is no place for raw garlic in a fully cooked dish. When he delivered the food he came back with parmesan to grate, after that we didnt seem him ever again. He didn't come to ask if everything was ok or anything. It was almost like he would do anything to be away from the table, to get away as fast as possible. My family- including my fiance was satisfied with their meals.  My fiance asked for a box so the waiter brought 4 boxes. I didnt want to take anything home, as I was incredibly dissatisfied with my meal, which the waiter didn't know because he didnt care to ask. The waiter didnt just joke with me about leaving my plate but literally paused and told me ""how could you waste food like that? I would never leave that much food on the table. You can't just leave that, it's such a waste.""  Im sorry, im the one paying, and I paid for food that I didnt like. Maybe, if I barely ate anything, you should: ask if it's ok, if I enjoyed my meal, why I didn't enjoy it, what can I do to make it better.  But no I got a lecture on my wasteful ways.  How dare you force your views on a customer, how dare you force a customer to do something they don't want to. This led to my dad taking it home for my brother to shut him the hell up.  This is also what led me to write the review. I will not be told by my server that I have to take food home. All in all he was extremely unattentive and extremely rude when actually taking orders.  4 of us sat in a booth big enough for 2 people and the lights dimmed so we could barely read the dessert menu. The portions are way too big- which all of this I know isnt the service staffs fault. It just contributed to my irritation.  I had just finished a $2500 dinner/faschnact celebration service with one other cook in the kitchen at the establishment I work at, it went fantastically and I thought I was going to finish off the night with a great dinner and my parents who live hours away, only come to visit once a year if I'm lucky.  The only good things about the meal were the red raspberry cocktail, the bread, and the cheesecake. The service was awful.  Im sorry to leave such a harsh review. But I am extremely dissapointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=200
Ayad A.,"San Diego, CA",25,8,,1.0,11/10/2014,"The cheesecake factory is well known to have outstanding customer service, delicious food and an overall great experience (it must be a California thing, people in the DC area don't get enough sunlight). I guess I had high expectations for a simple salad; definitely won't make that mistake again. So this is what happened!  A Greek salad is comprised with Romaine, onions, olives, bell peppers, cucumber, tomatoes and feta cheese. Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, black pepper, pour the dressing, toss and serve (sounds easy enough) So I ordered a salad; all I wanted was Romain lettuce, feta cheese, grilled chicken breast and some salad dressing. Nothing too complex like ordering smoked halibut, filet mignon or even tuna tartare. Just a simple Greek salad!.... Where do I begin this review? Let's start off with the waiter shall we?  One; she didn't greet us when we sat down on the table, Two; I asked what's the specialty today? she couldn't recommend a Single dish on the menu, Three; (The restaurant usually serves warm wheat and white bread as a starter /appetizer so customers wouldn't get hungry while waiting for the main dish).... We were served hard cold bread, Four; 25 minutes later! she finally brings out our soft drinks, Five; coming from the Arctic kitchen she then brings out the food to the table. That's when everything went downhill from there. First off the chicken in my salad was raw and there was no feta cheese or salad dressing. My friend who was visiting DC from California; her nachos were frozen like our waiters attitude!.... Not once did the waiter come back to check in on us.  After all this frustration I asked to see the manager! (This should be interesting!) I expressed to the manager on duty that our service and food were both unacceptable. She replied stating ""I do apologize sir for any inconvenience that has occurred tonight is completely my fault"" (i'm glad there's an adult working here who realized this wasn't acceptable). She did apologize and recognized how disrespectful and rude our waiter was and offered to replace my meal only (not including my friends dish) and add a complementary cheesecake slice. I refused and replied ""you need to understand the situation, it's not about getting a free meal it's about managing your staff and serving your customers needs at best"". ""Is this not in Tysons Galleria? I receive better customer service at Harris Teeter's salad bar"". ""This is the Cheesecake Factory! your level of customer service is poorly represented and needs to change before you lose more and more customers in the future"". 15 minutes pass-by nothing happens?

I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and asked them to add andouille sausage. (Side note: it looked NOTHING like the pic from the business owner). They usually give a ton of pasta and it continues to swell in the to-go packaging so also asked for extra sauce. 20 minutes and I go in for pick up. I check my bag, all appeared to be there except for my extra sauce. The attendant runs to grab some and comes back with a half a cup of sauce. Really? Oookay, whatever. I'm tired and hungry and don't even want to ask why. Off I go to enjoy my take out.  I get home and find that my pasta is dry! I don't know if they interpreted my extra sauce to mean sauce on the side, but it was completely dry! There four shrimp TOTAL. Yes, I picked them out and counted. This is a $20 dish and they charged me $4 to add andouille sausage. So I called and asked for a manager. I told him what happened and he offered to ""knock a few bucks off"" to which I said WHAT?? I just spent $25 on a meal all to get home and discover it was dry but you wanna knock a few bucks off?!?!  Thank God I reminded the attendant about the extra sauce because what little they gave was all I had!!! But I digress. Back to this manager...so he tells me if I want to come back (in the rain) to grab some more sauce, he'd ""take care of me"" again to which I replied, what the hell?!?! The whole purpose of me ordering take out is because I didn't want to cook AND because it was nasty out. But you are offering to accommodate me with more sauce and a couple of bucks?? At this point I'm furious and these baby shrimp were staring back at me pissing me off even further. So I finally tell him, you do what you need to do and I'll call my bank to dispute the ENTIRE charge AND post pics of these infant shrimp with a detailed review. The moment I said review, his tune changed. He offered a full refund and apologized after insisting that he could do no more than ""a couple bucks"" because he wants me to come back. NOT because he wants to ensure satisfaction but because you want me to come buy more baby shrimp over dry pasta. Honey please!! Whatevs! I've gone to the location in Chevy Chase and the service is great and I never had issues with take out. I don't plan on visiting this location again anytime soon. It's not the first time I've experienced issues but they were minor so I didn't bother. But this took the cake for me. No pun intended. Save your money or go someplace else.

My Louisiana Chicken Pasta tasted weird and the sauce was already starting to congeal so it had that saran wrap look to the sauce around the plate.

No.  But the service was good and the food was decent.  Between us, we ordered the ahi tuna salad and the burger.  We weren't too hungry because we had eaten lunch fairly close to the time we visited this restaurant, but it was a great snack to tide us over until dinner.  This Cheesecake Factory is located within the Tysons II mall, which is the more upscale of the two malls. We didn't need a reservation when we visited at around 4/5pm on a Saturday afternoon, but they were still quite busy.  I would definitely visit again, though Tysons Corner is a bit far from where we live and I don't have too many occasions to visit the Tysons II mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean

Anyways when we made our way to the hostess desk we were greeted right away and was seated in a short time. The waiter came within 10 min and she was super nice and showed plenty of enthusiasm. My only issue with this place is that they can never get it right with the temperature. Inside is always super cold and that should be monitored better when it's already super cold outside making it quite difficult to enjoy your meal. We started  with appetizers that consisted of fried calamari and buffalo chicken strips with the buffalo sauce on the side. The appetizers came out hot and pretty quick. There was no complaints on these items. Both were very good. Next the main meals, we ordered the kids cheese pizza, shrimp jambalaya and the chicken madeira. All of these was super good as well.

I'm giving Cheesecake Factory a 4/5 stars in this one because the food here is good but it's nothing particularly special. If you've frequented this restaurant you would know that Cheesecake Factory serves very large portions. I often opt for the ""skinny"" menu as I can hardly ever finish a regular sized plate. The main attraction of course though is the wide array of cheesecake options that you can enjoy! A personal favorite of mine is the Godiva chocolate cheesecake which is definitely large and rich enough to split between two!

Donna R.,"Warren, NJ",466,419,4091,5.0,9/11/2017,"I was visiting family in Vienna,VA. and we decided to come to Tyson's Corner Mall, to go shopping and have lunch.  I chose the Cheesecake Factory for lunch  because In the past I frequented the one in Boca Raton,Fl many times and loved it. What's not to like about the Cheesecake Factory?  It's not your typical chain.  From the minute I walked in, I saw a warm and cheery dining room and adjacent bar with high hats which is a great place to sit when the restaurant is packed.  You can just walk in and if open just sit instead of waiting for a table.  The staff is extremely professional and well trained. I knew it was mid afternoon so I was able to get seated right away.  My server was Jerry and he was very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable of the menu items. I started with their Tropical Ice Tea ( passion fruit) it's so delicious I didn't even need to add sugar.  If you ever come to the Cheesecake Factory , the menu is overwhelming. There are so many choices to choose from.  They have lunch specials, and one of my favorites is The Renee- One half of a Fresh Turkey Sandwich or Chicken-Almond Salad Sandwich, a Cup of Soup and a Small Green Salad or you can get a Small Caesar Salad for a $1.00 extra. This time I decided to order their Fish Tacos. 4 Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with   Grilled Fish, Avocado, Tomato, Chipotle Sauce, Marinated Onions and Cilantro. Served with Rice and Beans. My fish was tender, there was definitely a nice little bite of heat which gave great flavor to my dish along with the marinated onions and fresh cilantro. My avocado was soft and creamy so I didn't need sour cream .The portion size was great and it came with a side of rice and black beans which I combined.  My aunt had an omelette she was able to choose 4 fillings. Hers was Spinach, onions, mushrooms and goat cheese . They didn't have feta. It came with breakfast paprika  potatoes, and whole wheat toast. My aunt was very happy her omelette was cooked perfectly. I normally get their Apple Pie Cheesecake, which I'm not sure if it's seasonal. I also get the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  Cheesecake. This  time I was too full to order dessert.. I gave them 5 stars because the food is consistently good.

Alice J.,"Arlington, VA",19,323,1292,3.0,3/11/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Tyson II (Tyson Galleria, the high-end newer extension of the Tyson Mall). The wait time was 40 minutes on a Saturday night (7:30 pm). We were given a beeper. We couldn't leave the restaurant to take a stroll in the mall, because the range of the beeper is limited.  They don't take reservations. That's a disappointment.  The entrance to the restaurant was not welcoming because it was noisy and overflowing with people waiting to be seated. Further, the lighting was too dim.  When we were finally seated, the service was OK. The place was a bit noisy so we even had trouble being heard when placing our order. The dishes were good, and the key lime cheesecake especially great. After all it's their namesake. Their crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp was tasty (sweet and slightly spicy). The portion of rice was huge though. A friend had their broccoli steak which is great. I had never heard of that dish before. The crab cake (as an entree) was simple but good.  The lighting in the dining area was too dim. This is probably because we were tucked away in a corner (in a booth). I do love their booth seating. But the lighting is too dim for a convivial group dinner. The dim lighting may work for romantic dinners (just two people face to face).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean

Aarti B.,"McLean, VA",153,341,2016,4.0,4/24/2017,"Taken with a grain of salt that most of the food is fried and soaked in butter without any real flavor like most chain restaurants, Cheesecake is great for some warm comfort food and scoring some happy hour deals (Mon - Fri 4-6pm). There is an impressive selection of appetizers, sides, and a few drinks with generous portion sizes (they are the same as dinner portions!).  The avocado egg rolls are fried and stuffed with large chunks of avocado with tamarind cashew sauce. It was a hearty meal, I was stuffed after eating 4 of the 6 rolls. I ordered a salad to compensate for the egg rolls, which was good. The mojito was okay, I didn't finish it.  The service was the best part of the meal. The staff is attentive, friendly, and prompt with food.  Cheesecake is a great place to indulge in happy hour comfort food.

A B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,206,3,2.0,8/6/2009,"I can totally pass on this place. Went here tonight for a birthday dinner. Didn't want to eat too much or spend a lot of loot so I opted for an appetizer of the factory nachos. The plate was HUGE. And I'm a big believer in refried beans on my nachos, and those didn't exist. These nachos felt like they were missing something. The guacamole was really good, but everything else was just ""meh"". I should have asked for extra jalapenos. My mother said the same thing...the waiter asked if she could handle the chilis in her quesadilla and she said sure. She ended up not being able to taste them at all and was stealing jalapenos from my nachos for her quesadilla. Needless to say this place caters to the watered-down American chain restaurant standard as far as real food that doesn't involve sugar is concerned. I ended up skipping dessert because I had too many nachos. No cheesecake for me. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their dessert though. I definitely don't need to come back.  Oh, and yes, it takes like half an hour to go through the menu and find what you want. Partly because it's so long, partly because it's so darn dark inside of that place.

Andy P.,"Vienna, VA",2,39,,2.0,12/27/2008,"I pretty much feel like I have to rate this place because I've been here either because I've had a giftcard or been dragged here so many times and have tried probably half of their huge menu. Frankly I kind of wonder why it's so popular. The Cheesecake really is a 5 but everything else is about a 2. Maybe I should bump up the rating since they do emphasize the best thing they have, but if they're going to function as a full service restaurant they should be rated that way. I won't waste time with a dish-by-dish. Basically they've got a huge menu that has a touch of just about everything that's popular -- burgers here, some pasta there, Chinese over there, some Mexican and BBQ tossed in, and so on. Whatever you get, you can be assured that it won't be baaad (pause), but it won't be really great either, it will certainly come in a huge, overpriced portion that you have no chance of eating by yourself. It's almost as though they feel like they have to justify their absurd prices by doubling or tripling their portions. That's particularly annoying since they're in mall and so if you're there, you're likely to have plans that don't include running home to throw your doggie bag in the fridge. Anyway, complaints aside, I have a few recommendations. 1) Just come for the cheesecake. It's kinda steep but it is very good, and Tyson's has lots of places to eat. 2) Come with enough people that you can split a couple appetizers and entres and share-- the tables aren't really laid out for that sort of thing, but the appetizers are pretty good and you'll still get plenty of food without having to overpay for a so-so meal. 3) As for actual dishes, my favorite so far is the shepard's pie, and they've got a couple salads that are pretty good. Their pastas are my least favorite bc they skimp on the meat. Service is decently standardized. It's never terrible but it's never great either. Not surprisingly they're slow at busy times, and they sometimes get flustered if you ask for anything out of the ordinary -- pretty standard for a large chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=380

Jim L.,"Alexandria, VA",1,9,,1.0,12/19/2006,"This review is not to rate an overall dining experience with this restaurant.  I may do a review in the future as I've eaten at this location and other locations several times, and all the experiences have been very positive. This review is over how an unfortunate incident was handled by the shift manager.   My dinner companion and I decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory for some appetizers and dessert to pick up our spirits after a bad experience with our Thai dinner.  I've tried about half of their selection of cheesecakes before, and they've all been outstanding.  I'm a big cheesecake fan, so I have lots to compare a cheesecake experience to.  But that's getting off point here. We arrived at about 9pm and were seated immediately.  Seating during the prime dinner hour is usually a very long wait.   And like the other reviews pointed out, the service is slow.  This is why one should always be in good company.  It makes the wait go by faster. We ordered the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls, Firecracker Salmon Rolls, and Lemoncello Cream Torte and Paradise Tropical Iced Tea to drink.    I know I've said this review isn't about the food, but just a brief note.  The Spicy Ahi Rolls according to the description is supposed to be raw tuna.  It came completely cooked and a bit dry.  The presentation was great and the sauce was very good.  The Firecracker Salmon Rolls was spot on perfect.  The salmon was tender and fatty.  And that  sweet hot chili sauce was just great. Ok, the reason for the 1 star.  The iced tea came in a glass with a big chip in the rim the size of a nickel.  In the dim lighting, we didn't notice it at first.  But then my dinner companion sucked up a shard of glass in the iced tea which made us painfully away of the chip!!  No one was injured or cut, but the thought of drinking glass shards in ones iced tea is offensive.  And we wonder how many bits of glass was drank without notice before this! After waiting about 10 minutes for our waiter to walk by, he showed up, and we made him aware of the problem.  He took the drink away and said he'd get the manager.  After about another 10 minutes, the manager comes to our table and asked us what the problem was!!!  She asked us WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS!  I have no doubt the waiter told her what the problem was.  And if you're the manager of restaurant, your job is now one of spin control and public relations.  Feigning ignorance of the situation is not your best first course of action. So we promptly told her that the problem is that we don't like drinking shards of glass with our iced tea.  She asked if anyone was hurt, and we told her everyone seems physically well, no blood gushing on the table or anything.  This seems to be the extent of her concern.  There was not a hint of embarrassment or contrition over her staff just serving a patron a beverage with a BROKEN PIECE OF GLASS in it.  She asked if that was all.  And we said we'd at least like the drink that was taken away to be replaced (hopefully without the extra glass this time).   She asked if there was anything else.  At this point, my dinner companion in sarcastic tone told her please make sure that no one else gets served beverages with broken glass in it.  It's almost surreal to hear a conversation like that outside of a TV sitcom.  At this point, the manager finally seemed to get the point that we're a bit unsatisfied with the service.  She said that glass had been thrown away and that she would take care of this on the bill.  When the bill came back, she had removed the cheaper of the two appetizers.  Nice.  Very classy. Anyway, for those of you yelpers out there, inspect your glasses closely before you drink. BTW:  This is the first time I did not order a piece of cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe the universe is trying to tell me something.

Nia S.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,11,14,2.0,3/26/2016,"WARNING: REAL & HONEST REVIEW(CONTINUE TO READ AT YOUR OWN RISK) Went shopping around the tysons corner area today and decided to stop and have lunch at the cheesecake factory. I must say i had an overall weird experience. My waiter was very unusual and creepy acting. He was attentive to every table he was serving except for ours. I had to get his attention numerous times for drink refills and a check, even though he was very assisting to the other tables. He was somewhat nice but his actions were rude. I'm starting to think his lack of assistance had something to do with my mother and I. Not sure what we did, but it felt personal :/ I shouldnt have to feel that way leaving any establishment.  I usually like cheesecake factory food, but at this one, it was not so great. I ordered simple and got a pepperoni pizza with a side of fries. My mother ordered some sort of tamale. My pizza was poorly made and cheese wasnt covered on a part of it. Also my fries were partially burnt. HOW CAN YOU MESS UP FRENCH FRIES? My mothers tamale had a very foul odor. Almost a  ""musk"" kind of smell. We had went to another cheesecake factory over at potomac mills a couple weeks back and it had absolutely no foul odor. We did not order any dessert because of the much time wasted while the waiter was getting the check. Wish i could tell you his name but he didnt even tell us...  The cheesecake factory has terrible wait times. Plus it was a saturday evening so i was expecting to be sitting and waiting for a table for atleast half an hour. But to my surprise, we were seated immediately. Hardly anyone was there and practically some areas were empty. (WHICH IS WHY I DONT KNOW WHY THE WAITER SUCKED) A couple that had just been seated a few tables back yelled at my waiter and was very frustrated for no one assisting them. They had been sitting there for quite some time now, and i could see their faces starting to frown. At the same time, waiters a few feet behind them were slacking and having side conversations and giggling while they could have helped that couple. Overall, the staff needs to be more attentive.  I will try my best to avoid coming back to this crusty beat down over priced establishment again. Please do the same. I know many more clean cheesecake factories that will actually NOTICE you are there(Potomac Mills one isnt so bad) I will not be surprised when this establishment gains a bad reputation. The waiters there just dont care.. I will be more than happy to take my hard earned money and spend it at a mcdoanlds that knows how to properly run a restaurant than this place. EDIT: My waiters name was Rahul! His deep voice is very prominant(You'll know when its him) I see other yelpers have had bad experiences with him too.

Wing K.,"Vienna, VA",17,109,39,4.0,11/13/2015,"Went on an early Tuesday evening. Interesting to go to the Cheesecake factory after hearing about it in my life whether its from the Big Bang Theory or elsewhere. In any case, TBBT is inaccurate on the depiction of the Cheesecake factory.  It was a party of 8. For appetizers we had nachos, summer rolls, and wontons. The nachos were ok albeit I've had better. The wontons also ok. The summer rolls very subpar. Whoever had the idea to put shrimp and noodles in a spring roll wrapper to create this particular summer roll is clearly an idiot.  My party had crab cakes, steak, pasta, and some other items. For the most part, everybody liked their entrees. I had a crusted salmon kale salad. It was very good. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the kale was sliced well. The dressing was also good. Overall, entrees were good. Everybody got cheesecake to go. I had the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake. It was good, but could have certainly had a stronger coffee or kahlua taste to it. The sweetness of the chocolate overwhelmed the other two flavors. Nevertheless I enjoyed it.  Would probably go to the Cheesecake factory again. Its semi-affordable for the area and a decent value. Service was good, my water was refilled.

That doesn't mean I don't love the delicious array of cheesecakes lined up in the front. Whoever had that idea was def a marketing genius! How convenient: Name the restaurant Cheesecake factory and line up cheesecakes in the front so no one goes out once they decide to step in. Thus is the reason I dont enter this forbidden place much because I know once I do, I would have to grab a bite of that sinful cheesecake and order a 2000 calorie laden humongous dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=120
Avery K.,"McLean, VA",0,2,,2.0,8/28/2016,"Since this is a very large chain restaurant, you pretty much get the big idea about it by going to one location. Though I obviously haven't been to every single Cheesecake Factory location, this one particularly stands out to me in a negative way. I have been a few times for certain dinners / lunches over the course of this year and have found myself disappointed more and more following each visit. Every single time, the service was slow, staff was rude, and food arrived cold.

Melody M.,"McLean, VA",0,32,64,4.0,12/26/2014,"I come here often, considering the location is convenient for me since it's in the Tysons Galleria aka the upscale mall of McLean. There's no doubt they call it 'Cheesecake Factory' as the cheesecake is SUPERB! I'm not kidding..I don't see how NY cheesecake is that much better. In fact, the oreo dream extreme cheesecake here is out of this world!!! Rich fudgy milk chocolate frosting, creamy original cheesecake, THE BEST OREO MOUSSE, and chocolate cake into one. If this doesn't describe heaven, I don't know what does. I've also had the pumpkin cheesecake which is excellent! Rich but not overpowering.  The bread they bring you here is to die for! Sometimes the servers are a bit slow to bring the bread, but don't be shy and get your bread! It's too good in fact whenever I'm here I ask for an extra basket. :) The basket comes with brown and white bread, and the brown is my fave. It's like a sweeter bread, I always ask for more!! Onto the food, I've only had the pizza which is actually pretty good. I know people would probably think pizza from here is mediocre, but it's actually good. The crab cake appetizer is AMAZING!! You have to try this. They come with 6 mini crab cake bites, which are perfectly fried and steaming hot. No joke, I think they're better than the crab cakes at The Palm. Now I only wish they had this as an entree...they probably do. The only downside is that they usually give you a table in the dark, so I have to always request to change it. Sometimes the staff aren't too nice about that and make you wait a bit longer. Once you get a good table though, the atmosphere is pretty cool and makes you feel like you are at a fancier restaurant than you actually are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=120

Marcus P.,"Washington D.C., DC",68,126,6,3.0,7/16/2011,"It's easy to pick on The Cheesecake Factory; it's monolithic, it's ostentatious...it's downright garish. But unlike 16 years ago (when I loathed this place for being an accesory to the manslaughter of ""real"" restaurants), today I find the grandiose overwork of that Roman-y motiff refreshing, actually. It's familiar and safe and very luxurious compared to the indy-boutiquey-trendy D.C. spots I've been hitting lately.  First of all, on a Saturday afternoon, three of us were seated in a booth that could easily accommodate, let's say, Ashanti and her crew NOW--surely. Our waiter, Robert, was excellent...almost creepily so. Not nearly as modelesque as some of those trendy D.C. restaurants' waiters, but disarmingly charming, well versed, well rehearsed. My table mate admitted: I'd give him some if I were into white guys like that. I think we all were impressed...but I digress.  I ordered a staple: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. After nearly two decades of dining here I've tried just about everything on the jy-normous menu and know most of it to be mostly moderate fare with the occasional, ""Wow! Taste this..."" moments sprinkled here and there. My mates ordered the Louisiana Pasta and the Seared Salmon. The dishes were huge and spicy and pretty damn good, we had to admit. Yes it was a sadistic amount of food; yes it tasted somewhat mass-produced and recently refreshed with sauces, spice, a sprig of pasley and a squeeze of lemon. Let me ask you something: you ever pay $50 for a meal that looked like it was prepared for a oompa-loompa? Colorful; interesting; small. I revel in the fact of knowing I'll have leftovers later tonight...I even ordered another basket of that delicious wheat bread at the end of the meal. And the total for such opulence: $67...amazing, trust me.   Back in the day I hated The Cheesecake Factory for the pretentious bore I thought it was; today I enjoy it as an inevitable way of ending a ""pamper me"" day of material waste and gluttony at my local mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=300

Wasn't impressed this time, actually disappointed this time. A cheese pizza was ordered, and my sister said it made her stomach hurt. Also ordered fish tacos(includes beans and rice) Which was alright, but not that hot. (Could tell they waited for all the dishes to come out, because the tacos weren't as hot, as i would prefer.) I ordered a chicken dish with a cream sauce and tomatoes. Sounded good,  as i was trying to pick a pasta dish that didn't have cheese in it, as I'm allergic. The dish came nice and hot, but covered in cheese. (I didn't know when I ordered it, otherwise wouldn't have gotten it.) The waitress came over and said there's no cheese in that dish, well obviously there was, you could smell and see it. But she was nice enough to take it back and off the final check. I ordered white chicken chili, which usually I LOVE. But this time it was just awful. Was not chili, as the taste was very brothy(like soup). Tasted like they didn't have enough chili, so to do things quickly, they poured over chicken and rice soup over it( which is what it tasted like)I'm not a soup person, or do i like both/soupy things. Yuck, absolutely disgusting. Ate some, but was totally grossed out. Payed, and ended up going to Baja fresh near our house. Overall, won't be back anytime soon.

Tricia L.,"Germantown, MD",9,6,2,1.0,6/16/2013,"Where to start?... Hmm well I can confidently say that I had one of the worst dining experiences tonight at this Cheesecake Factory. We arrived at Cheesecake around 8:45 and surprisingly there was no wait (after all it was a Saturday night). We had to make a 10:50 movie so this was perfect!  Our server was Tareq who greeted us fairly quickly after we were seated. We started by ordering waters and received them shortly after. Good start right? Let me emphasize START because everything went downhill from here. My one guest ordered a Dirty Ketle martini with blue cheese olives, I ordered a passion fruit mojito and my other guest ordered an old fashion. Our drinks took some time to get delivered and when we received them we were not impressed. My mojito looked and tasted good but really didn't have any liquor in it. Don't get me wrong, I am by no means an alcoholic but if i wanted juice it sure as hell wouldn't have costed $10... My one guest might as well just have ordered olive juice.....Sounds gross right? Right, his martini was awful and as crazy as it sounds really didn't taste like it had liquor in it either...weird considering 98% of a martini is supposed to be liquor. Oh yes and I forgot to mention the fact that he didn't get his blue cheese olives.  Whatever, anyways he got his olives and drank his liquor infused olive juice so we weren't ""those people."" Who are those people you ask; those people are the ones who constantly complain when they go out to eat for no reason other than to get shit for free. There is however a time and place for this obnoxious behavior and tonight was one of them. Now on to the food order. My one guest ordered the coulette steak MEDIUM RARE, my other guest ordered shrimp jumbalaya with extra sauce on the side and I ordered the chicken tortilla salad. Food came out and the steak was on the verge of well done (Ew), my salad had maybe 5 small slithers of chicken in it and the extra sauce for the shrimp dish was nonexistent. Funny considering our server was also non existent for a good 20 minutes. Long enough for my guest to get out of his seat and have to ask a bus boy for the extra sauce. It came out and then 5 minutes later so did Tareq. He asked how everything was at that moment......really? It's a little too late don't you think? Yeah so that was that. At the end of the meal I informed Tareq how overcooked the steak was and made it known that we were looking for him but he was not around. He expressed concern for .5 seconds and then walked away to get the dessert menu. At this point I was so fed up with everything that I declined cheesecake; this was one of the only reasons I wanted to go to cheesecake in the first place. Sooo to say I was pissed is an understatement....we paid our bill and tipped just under 18% because being a server myself I understand the whole $3.00 a hour issue. Let it be known though that he deserved way less than this. I then asked to speak to a manager when as my server I think Tareq should have taken the initiative to get them involved from the beginning. I told the manager, Jeremy what happened and explained the inattentiveness of Tareq and lack of urgency in his staff. Jeremy was nice and said everything a manager should say including ""when you come back I will take care of you."" This was a nice gesture but I live over an hour away from this location and the last thing I want is to have another awful experience. However, I feel as though he could have handled a guest complaint a little differently, it was as if it were of no real concern at that moment. Moral of the story is for the first time in a long time I was dissatisfied with over 90% of my dining experience at a chain restaurant. I hope this issue is addressed ASAP.

I've come for lunch and dinner but I hear their brunch is pretty flippin fantastic too. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their forever long menu either, everything is good and dessert is of course the best part - a nice long list of cheesecakes. Their pumpkin cheesecake is what I wait for every fall but on their year round menu, go with the Turtle or Vanilla. Come to think of it, even their specialty desserts are really good too (Carrot cake!!) The fact that this place is open late makes it even better.

Jack F.,"Dallas, TX",559,1045,803,3.0,1/31/2010,"Strategy:  At restaurant factories like the Cheesecake Factory you need to be prepared and you need to know how to plan your menu.  First, arrive early to bet the lunchtime/dinnertime rush.  You don't want to be stuck waiting for an hour for mediocre food.  Second, be mindful of portion sizes.  A single entree is enough to feed a table of 3 or 4 people.  If you truly want variety, order the Factory Appetizer Favorites for $29.00  (Serves Four or More! A Combination of Our Favorite Appetizers including: Avocado Eggrolls, Spinach and Cheese Dip, Pot Stickers, Shrimp Summer Rolls, Quesadilla, Corn Cakes, Buffalo Blasts® and Calamari.)  No joke, they bring out four plates of food.  Since most of these dishes are vegetarian, order a set of mini-burgers to get your fill.  As for the cheesecake?  One slice is plenty for the entire table.  Anymore and you'd be in a food coma.  Of course, my favorite part about the Cheesecake Factory?  You bank on their mistakes.  Our chicken fried steak sliders came out 25 minutes after ordering.  The manager eventually came by and offered everyone a free slice of cheesecake.  This kind gesture won't bump up my review but it's enough to keep me happy and willing to return again.  What's the price of my patience?  Apparently a slice of cheesecake.  [Last Visit: January 31, 2010]",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=300

We were told we would have a 15 minute wait.  It turned into 30 minutes and people coming in after us were being sat. 2. Sat down at our table and we had to ask for our waiter.  He came over and we said, ""How are you?"", he said ""Busy"", took our drink orders and walked away. 3. We were in the restaurant at the end of the lunch rush, approx. 1:30pm.  I would say the restaurant was 1/2 full.  Our server finally took our orders 15 minutes after dropping off our drinks.  We then waited another 40 minutes to get our food! 4. Not only did we wait 40 minutes to get our food, only 3 meals were served out of our party of 4!  Our server never came back over to check on us to even notice that we didn't have one of our meals at our table.  We finally had to go ask for the manager. . . . 5.  The manager took another 10 minutes to come over to the table and then bumbled his way through excuses instead of just saying he was sorry.  After 10 minutes of listening to his only concern being that ""we want you to eat, can I get a meal for you"" of which at this point, the rest of us were done with our meals.  The missing meal was not our concern at this point in our lunch.  He FINALLY ended up saying that he would take care of the meal.  We weren't sure if he was just taking care of the meal that didn't come out or our whole meal but we figured we would know  when our server came back with the check or said the meal was on him. 6. NO ONE EVER CAME BACK TO THE TABLE AFTER THAT!!!    We waited another 10 minutes, asked for our server again to see if we had a bill and he never came back to our table!!!  We ended up just walking out of the restaurant.

BF and I met my mom at the Galleria Cheesecake Factory for Saturday lunch. Drinks (just two Cokes and 3 waters) took over 10 minutes. A little annoyed since I was thirsty. Their bread ( sourdough and a dark oat wheat?) is still delicious. We ate the entire basket in 10 minutes. I ordered the grilled chicken this tostada salad from their lightened menu (Skinnylicious ), mom had the lunch miso salmon, and BF got the chicken Alfredo (dinner  portion so that he could the the rest home for leftovers). We were surprised that his dinner portion was not usual of Cheesecake Factory humungous notoriety. He gift his pasta first and 3 minutes later the rest of our meals came to the table. Not a big deal but it's usually not preferred to gave our entrees not to arrive at the same time. My salad was good but I had a hard time finding the chicken which only had a few chunks underneath the mound of shredded romaine lettuce.

So even a manager couldn't assist with adjusting the price enlight of what happened??? Guess bugs are just business as usual at this made it worst was there was no formal apology for what I experienced. It was dismissed like this happens all of the time, because it comes directly from the farm (don't you inspect and rinse you food) . That is not a good excuse for a bug being in my food, if I did not inspect my food then I was eating it I would have eaten a ladybug with my salad.

Between the slow service, absent minded server, incomplete order, and the indifferent attitude towards our complaints, led us to forgo our dessert and leave with our experience unsatisfied....much like leaving a strip club unsatisfied.  Come to think of it, you always leave a strip club unsatisfied. Anyways I digress.   This is not rocket science.  The ability to multi-task is a prerequisite for employment at any restaurant.  Not only was multi-tasking not a part of this servers repertoire, empathy for his mistakes were nowhere to be found.  Some food was overcooked, others were missing requested modifications, drinks were made with incorrect garnishes, and the 20 minutes it took for our server to check on us after we had completed our meal is unacceptable. On top of all of this, the complaint to management was additionally lack luster.  Yes, we received an apology, but the effort stopped there to ease our dissatisfaction.   Im going to chalk this up to being an isolated incident.  It's not like I'm never going to go back to cheesecake.  But just done expect much from this particular establishment in terms of stellar customer service.  You might actually get better customer experience from the one legged stripper with crack yellow teeth and overgrown pubic hair.......cause you know that she needs your money!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=220

And the lettuce that was served with the salad was extremely wilted and had brown spots. That should have been our first warning that there were issues with the kitchen.  We all ordered ""standards"" from the menu ... burger with mac n cheese ... Bang Bang Chicken Shrimp and the Cheese Steak sandwich.  Of the three entrees only the Bang Bang entree met TCF's standards.  The Cheese Steak was barely filed with meat which was overcooked and the cheese nonexistent.  The burger with mac n cheese arrived about 15 minutes later.  While the burger was cooked to order the mac n cheese topping was cold.

Like, seriously, we're here for dinner, not free therapy. After we told her THREE  times to make sure our food was warm, she disappeared for a long time and then brought out our cold pasta and frozen chicken and a soggy burger. No joke. When we called for the manager, he came by and argued with me that my food wasn't cold (he didn't even touch it) and said the chicken was perfectly cooked and he could bring out a thermometer to test  it. Have you ever?? When the food is cold, fix the bloody meal - don't argue with the customer whose waited 1.25 hours for an undercooked meal! We finally got fed up and told him to take the food away, which he did and never returned! We went to walk out and he stopped to ""explain"" how the food  was fine - again - and instead I asked for his name (Amos Machadu) to complain to the corporate offices, and he looked like he could care less.

The caveat to all this is my wish that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best. So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have both gone the way of the dodo, and it's a complete travesty.  Sigh...  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=220

David L.,"Waco, TX",223,869,119,3.0,5/22/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is a at once one-of-a-kind and ubiquitous. There is no place like it, and yet, there are over 150 places like it. It is almost inseparable from the American mall experience, and it is in this sense a standard-bearer for the American mono-culture.  It is at once quotidian and surprisingly absurd. Their menu, for instance, boasts over 26 pages and upwards of 200 items. Among these pages, which are interspersed with product advertisements, you will find dishes from all over the world. In just a couple of pages you're liable to find English fish and chips, Cajun Jambalaya, Mexican tacos, Italian chicken Parmesan, an Asian orange chicken, your mother's meatloaf, and everything in between. They especially like fusion items like Tex-Mex egg rolls or Vietnamese tacos that run roughshod over traditional cuisine. The 'factory' is the American melting pot in microcosm, fusing, dissolving, and bastardizing custom, tradition, and culture. Admittedly, everything comes out tasting just fine, but I still feel a little soulless eating my multinational meal.   They have also incorporated the American maxim that bigger is better. Their utter disregard for portion control is at once admirable and laughable. I admire their freedom from the sometimes obsessive American concern for health, but I disapprove of their swinging the pendulum over to the equally American penchant for gluttony. These dishes can easily feed three people. If I wanted to eat it at home, I would have ordered takeout. And why would I want to eat this food at home, away from their fittingly opulent but totally unplaceable aesthetic? Their golden fabrics, dark woods, and modern lighting are characteristic of anywhere and nowhere. Beneath this patina of luxury, you sense the newness and kitsch that comprises their corporate aesthetic. You are surrounded by abundance, and yet it's not really excellence. The surfeit of food, drink, and cheesecake fills me to overflowing, but still leaves me feeling somewhat empty inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=220

Amy J.,"West Babylon, NY",40,5,,2.0,4/2/2016,"I'm visiting the area for the weekend and I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before. This one is located inside the Tysons Galleria which is a very upscale shopping mall attached to the Ritz Carlton. I was very optimistic based on the location and appearance at first glance. I stopped in with my boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated right away. As soon as he sat down in the booth, his hand landed in what appeared to be melted cheesecake that was on the seat. Our silverware was set on the bare table and one of the spoons had what looked like caramel on it and there was also some in the middle of the table. They obviously didn't clean it after the previous guests and also didn't bother removing the dirty silverware and apparently expected us to eat with it and not notice. I was very turned off and considered leaving right then. Instead, when our server came over to greet us we asked for clean utensils and to have the table wiped. He was very apologetic and took care of it. We ordered a mojito and an old fashioned, the roadhouse sliders and meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread. Our server, Andrew, asked if we would like bread for the table and I said yes. Things were looking up. Andrew brought us some water while we were waiting for our cocktails (which was very thoughtful because the drinks were taking forever) and some bread and butter. The drinks took a good 10 minutes to arrive but when they did they looked fantastic and they were delicious and worth the wait. We took a few bites of the bread when we noticed a long dark hair in it. At this point I was done. When Andrew passed by again, we showed him the hair and I told him we wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. And that is what we did. I work in a restaurant myself so I understand that things happen sometimes. But this place didn't even try.

The manager came by.  We explained the order had been sent back.  It had been about 10 minutes (my 11 year old son sitting next to me starving and waiting).  He said he just saw it enter the kitchen and it would be at least 10 more minutes before we got more food (ended up being closer to 15, total 25 minutes).  Not sure why it took our waiter 10 minutes to carry a plate back to the kitchen.  We complained that this was too long and he got defensive saying that he never sends out food that is not freshly cooked etc.  Never made eye contact, never apologized.  He left and we felt worse than before he showed up. He did comp us for that dish. The kids started to melt down, so we finally took the rest of the food to go.  We ordered a piece of ""plain classic"" cheesecake to take with us. After 10 more minutes the waiter came by to tell us that they were out of this.  Think of that, the Cheesecake Factory, out of cheesecake.  But, he said, we could order the cheesecake with strawberry sauce, with the sauce on the side, and that was the same cheesecake as the plain cheesecake.  Good thing he made us wait 10 minutes to tell us that.  We ordered, and finally 10-15 minutes later (total time about 2.5 hours) we got out of there.

The menu has more than 250 items (crazy right @__@), so it has great variety; however, for an indecisive person like me -- it's a struggle choosing something *sobs* We ended up waiting about 30-40 minutes for food (but probably because we had such a big group). I ended up eating the Tuscan Chicken, and also mooched off the Four Cheese Pasta my friends got. The food was good, but nothing too special. The Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake is AMAZING though. It may have been too sweet for some of my friends, but anything with oreos is just godly *^* Our waitress was great, I loved her attitude and she was really nice to all of us. I can't imagine having to serve 17 people or even more... The Cheesecake Factory is also great because they're more then willing to make modifications to your food. For example; you can ask for them to prepare your meal without added salt, have the dish come with another pair of sides, etc. Also, they give HUGE proportions so you're definitely getting your money's worth!

I've been to this one a handful of times over the past few years and have never had a bad experience. We usually fail to make reservations and have a bit of a wait, but beyond that, the specialty drinks (I usually try for a skinny to offset my cheesecake a bit,) the food (ahi tuna salad!,) and the cheesecake (from oreo to dulce de leche to red velvet and beyond) are just to die for.  We also have a habit of going in to pick up a slice for a special occasion, so if you're interested in doing that and are ordering more than one slice, you're really better off ordering an entire cheesecake due to the pricing structure. Gain a few pounds, lose a few dollars, eat here, YUM.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=140
Mary K.,"Leesburg, VA",0,6,2,1.0,9/5/2015,"My husband picked up cheesecake on Tuesday, 9/1.  After dinner at home I was sharing my Red Velvet piece with my toddler.  He took a bite which had a clear piece of plastic in it.  Thank goodness he did not swallow this.  I'm very disappointed that I contacted the location and have yet to receive a response.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=140

Sharcoal E.,"Vienna, VA",23,23,35,3.0,4/17/2014,"My favorite is the pasta da vinci...its made with penne pasta,madeira sauce,mushrooms,and carmelized onions. The taste is flavorful compared to any other dishes and its not typical. So it is a must have when you go to cheesecake factory. It wont disappoint you. The rest of the pasta entrees are just typical that you can get in other restaurant. For a salad, try the Luau Salad. Its fund and colorful. It has a layer of a crunchy sheet and the salad dressing is on the vinegerette/sweet balsamic side. It has chicken and lots of colorful veggie salad. I also like thr crunchy cuban rolls if you like a meaty appetizer...they also have crunchy avocado rolls if your on the vegetarian side. For the complimentary bread, go for the honey wheat. I like their chocolate cake with coconut :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=140

Dinah W.,"Alexandria, VA",164,98,262,1.0,9/25/2015,"The above rating is based on waiter service. The restaurant and food is a solid 4 star rating. This particular Cheesecake Factory is located at Tysons Corner mall in McLean Virginia. Parking spaces we're not very limiting and they offer valet service at this particular mall. I've found it to be a little bit too overpriced because you have to pay the cost of the valet + tip. In my opinion this is a complete waste of money if you are capable of walking from the parking lot to the mall. There wasn't a long wait and I was able to be seated immediately. A little while later, our waiter came by and dropped off the menus and whisked away without asking if we needed anything to drink. He returned about ten minutes later and proceeded to ask what we'd like to drink. He took 15 minutes to return with the drinks and the Sierra Mist was extremely flat and distasteful. He took our drinks back, returned 10 minutes later, and left once more to tend to another table. It took a while before he came back to our table to take our order. When he finally made it, he took our menus and asked if we'd like refills. When he did, we asked if we could get bread for the table as well. It didn't take him as long this time around, but when he returned with the drinks, he was in such a frenzy, he spilled drink on me while refilling my cup. He didn't offer paper towel or additional napkin. He just took off to take care of another table at the far end. When our food finally came, one of my friend's meal wasn't the correct order. The food did not  belong to another table either, so we had to wait some more. After we were done eating, he came by pretty quickly with the check and returned our cards back to us in far less time it took for him to actually serve the table. He still got a tip of course, but after this experience, I don't believe we will ever return to this location for dine-in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=140

I love the wraps, the filling of chicken, shitake mushrooms, and crispy rice noodles is savory and mouthwatering. I order this every time I dine here. It can be an entree but really enough for one somewhat hungry person.

The bread was so stale and hard. My sons root beer was so watered down that it was a caramel color rather than the normal brown color. It's 30 mins in and we have yet to receive our food.

Valentina D.,"Fairfax, VA",244,340,72,4.0,12/31/2013,"I used to work in a building attached to the Cheesecake Factory, so I came here for a lot of work lunches and late night dinners.  Nowadays, I only go for group meals where someone is making the restaurant choice.  It's not because I'm sick of Cheesecake Factory or because the food is bad (it's not!), but because the food is literally drowning in butter.  True story - I met someone who worked in Cheesecake Factory's kitchen, and he said he put about a stick of butter in each dish.  I have 2 favorite dishes here - the Pasta da Vinci (1524 calories) and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (1383 calories).  Feeling Italian tonight?  Get the Pasta da Vinci.  It's drowning in a delicious creamy mushroom sauce that reminds me of Maggiano's Rigatoni D.  Feeling like Asian tonight?  Get the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - white rice surrounded by a lake of a creamy coconut sauce with bits of chicken, shrimp, and veggies.  But the real test begins when you finish half of your meal - about 700 calories - because that's when you should be stopping and saving the rest for tomorrow's lunch. Now for dessert.  My favorite cheesecakes are the peppermint bark (900 calories) and pumpkin (740 calories) cheesecakes.  But share the dish or you won't be hungry tomorrow for breakfast...or lunch.  (Yes, it's happened to me!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=160
Preet M.,"Clarksburg, MD",1157,103,60,4.0,1/20/2015,"Service: I came here today for lunch as a part of a 35 person party. Our waitress, Karen was awesome. She took care of us and even let all of us split the bill between our group. We asked her what was easiest for her but she made sure to tell us whichever payment method we wished to use was ok with her. Food did take kind of long to come out but I mean we went with 35 people. Although I don't know if that means service would be slow on a packed Saturday night as well. In Either case, today was impressive. Food: I got the Smokehouse and was very satisfied. Cooked well and had the right amount of fries, sauces, condiments, ETC. Food at this restaurant is pretty standard across the board so I'm not going to bore everyone with the same summary I always use. Environment: This location has a few more windows so it wasn't as dark and intimate as the Montgomery Mall location.

Christopher C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,72,195,1.0,8/26/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory - most recently the Greek salad has become a favorite with the Teriyaki Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. Of course I love the desserts!  We like eating here when staying at the Ritz that adjoins Tyson's Galleria. It's especially nice that it is open late! The reason a 3.5 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=160

Mischita H.,"Orlando, FL",173,612,1346,3.0,8/11/2013,"After not being able to really decide on a place for dinner yesterday, we settled on this place. I often forget that there are so many choices on the menu...really not that good having too many choices for me when I don't know what I want. At any rate, we chose to sit at the bar rather than wait in line for a table.  Our service was pretty good.  In an effort to try something new, I tried the chicken samosas (appetizer) and grilled fish tacos which came with a side of rice and cheesy black beans. The samosas were very good.  My only complaint with the food is that I didn't like the softness of the soft corn tortillas - when I picked up the taco, it fell apart from the bottom. So not cool having to eat your tacos with a fork. Although, I strongly prefer crunchy corn tortillas, overall the taste was good and I would try them again (or other tacos)  ONLY IF I can get crunchy tortillas. My only complaint with the venu is that I thought the temperature was way too cool. By the time my food arrived, I was so cold that I just wanted to pack it up and go home. And, of course, I couldn't depart with out ordering a slice of the delish red velvet cheesecake to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=160
Joy B.,"Rockville, MD",170,338,3378,4.0,7/6/2014,"I love cheesecake. It is soft,sweet,creamy and delicious. There is an endless variety to chose from. So,how is it you say that I left without ordering dessert?  Maybe, it was the three pieces of warm,brown,sweet bread that they deliver piping hot to your table?  Or could it be the yummy ahi tuna salad with creamy avocado, ripe,farm fresh tomatoes and tangy dressing?  The tuna was cooked rare as I had ordered. The tuna had been edged in a border of spice that added to the flavor. My friend ordered the salmon with barbecue sauce and rice. It must be good, because there was not a drop left on his plate. It looked fresh and pink. Kudos to our waitress who was quick to fill up our ice tea glasses. She also navigated my friend's order, who is uber picky. He requested no onions, no parsley,and a double order of rice. She got it all done quickly and correctly. The servers were pleasant and good. The food was fabulous.

Stuart W.,"Damascus, MD",2,86,,3.0,10/26/2014,"We love the food at cheesecake factory and so decided to try this one while we were in the area. First of all we noted that it was one of the darkest restaurants we'd ever been in. Our server on this occasion was very slow and hilariously kept saying ""enjoy your time"" when walking away. We could have finished our meal probably 10-15 minutes sooner if he hadn't of kept disappearing. I had a vanilla milkshake to drink and I have to say it was near perfection. I think the best milkshake I've ever had. I had the buffalo burger which was delicious, I just wish there were a few more fries to accompany it. My wife, as always, had the marsala, which is enough for 2 meals and I'm told was delicious. We shared a piece of the s'mores cheesecake for dessert and could only manage half of it each before giving up! As always, the cheesecake was excellent.

Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",387,338,279,4.0,9/28/2012,"I'm updating my review to add an extra star for fantastic customer service.  The last two times I've visited the Cheesecake Factory, I have been greeted, seated, and served promptly, politely, and with a cheerful energy that says ""I know my menu and really want to be here serving you right now"".  I have found this a rarity in quick-turn mall-located restaurants, especially in this area.      This is a chain restaurant, plain and simple. Although the decor is quite generic, the roof high to carry the din of 50 other conversations and kitchen noises, and you always must brave crowds and pay ""mall prices"" for the cuisine, Cheesecake Factory-- especially THIS one-- has become one of my favorite chain restaurants not only for a quick nosh for myself after a hair appointment or between a Stuart Weitzman and Karen MIllen marathon, but also to take groups of people.      I don't know if I have just been lucky, but the past few times I've visited this location I have recieved above par customer service-- suggestions to complement the wine or food, news about the rookie barrista's talent making great lattes, the server's anticipation of needs before they become salient to the customer... all kinds of unexpected but appreciated little touches. I felt compelled to compliment the server's energy and competence to the manager on my last visit, as she exceeded my expectations and made a ""catching up with friends"" lunch seamless and even more enjoyable. I have been in and out in 40 minutes, or stayed and chattted with friends for 2 or more hours with no pressure to leave.    I usually stick to my favorite, fresh 'Go To' items on the menu, which are the ahi carpaccio and the thai chicken lettuce wraps. Many items are seasonal, but these two have fresh natural ingredients which cannot be frozen or made too far in advance. A widely-ranged menu is great for a diverse group of people, but you can't do everything perfectly executed in 20 minutes without sacrificing freshness.  For this reason, I recommend salads, pastas with fresh veggies, or other of the same ilk... read the ingredients to see what appeals to you and contains items that can't be frozen or preserved for days if this matters to you. My favorite cheesecake is the red velvet cake layered with cheesecake and topped with a creamy frosting and shaved bits of white chocolate-- although it is so rich I can only take a couple bites, and even then I have to have coffee to accompany the sweet rich concoction-- or a great cappuccino or latte made by that great new barista. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mclean?start=160
