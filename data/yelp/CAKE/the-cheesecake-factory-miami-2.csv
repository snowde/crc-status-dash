Mike C.,"Miami, FL",305,32,9,1.0,9/21/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory, like ""don't fight with me at Cheesecake"" kinda love but this location is by far the worst.  Don't let the outside crowd fool you, you will be seated right away. I know the menu inside and out so I was ready to order but nah the server decides to grab my drinks first.  I was fine with this. The problem begins after you place your order. Prepare to play the game of ""Where is Waldo?"" with your server. Mind you, there's a stampede of servers running around this place so it's a mind boggling experience.  10 minutes after placing the order, the bread comes, server leaves but the drink he brought me 20 minutes ago needed a refill.  Where is Waldo? I found Waldo but he's at the other end taking another table's order. I wave him over and he pretends like he doesn't have peripheral vision. I am watching ice melt at this point and a puddle forming from the condensation. Where is Waldo? 10 minutes later, the appetizer comes but it's colder than my ex gf. Not to mention, Waldo never brought me utensils.  Where is Waldo? Waldo comes back with the entree but I didn't get to address the appetizer issue because Waldo leaves again. Where is Waldo? So I'm there sitting with my date without utensils, cold apps, and literally cotton mouth. Waldo reappears and asks me how the food is so far? I address the issue and he finds the audacity to ask me not to tell the manager about what happened.  My take: Watching paint dry might actually take less time than the service at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=40
Alana A.,"Miami, FL",583,358,893,5.0,3/2/2016,"Came here for a staff lunch on a Friday afternoon - about 15 of us. We were seated within a matter of minutes. This location felt very clean and well-maintained. I ordered the crispy Cuban rolls and the chicken sliders appetizers. Both were fresh and delicious. Everyone else in my party seemed to have been happy with their meals as well. Service was very quick, attentive, and friendly.

Grace B.,"Washington, DC",170,122,437,5.0,7/11/2015,"Lately, I have been getting their cheesecake often. The oreo is my favorite. But the last dish I had here were the Baja Tacos. They were a little spicy but this dish can easily satisfy two people. The diced tomatoes, cool lettuce and sizzling chicken tossed in my mouth delightfully. I couldn't get enough. The small side of rice and beans weren't necessary to satisfy me but they tasted great!  I selected this dish because as soon as I walked into the restaurant a waiter walked passed me with two orders and the aroma flared my nostrils, watered my mouth and I just HAD to have it. No regrets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=40

Matt G.,"Morrisville, NC",36,630,,3.0,2/21/2016,"Location is good right inside the mall, I enjoyed taking a stroll inside the mall before and after my dinner. I had only had the cheesecake before but never tried a main course at the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is like a book, too big, when there are so many dishes I wonder if really all of them can be made with good quality.  Service was friendly and attentive and I liked the atmosphere inside, lighting music etc at the right level. But, the reason I give 3 stars instead of 4 is simple, even if the food is good, the price is too high for what it is. My shrimp pasta did not have enough shrimps in it to justify the 19 dollars. Also I expected more flavor.  You would think a chain restaurant would be cheaper, but it's not. At least this is the case for the pasta dishes, the others in my group had salads that were reasonably priced and big portions. Cheesecakes are obviously good for sure, but food might be a bit hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=40

The only dish I've been disappointed by is the veggie burger. It started falling apart the minute they placed the plate on the table. Other than that, the food is yummy and the service is decent. Sometimes it takes a while to get a hold of a server because the place is always full. Every piece of cheesecake I've tried has been delicious.

Sanita M.,"Tampa, FL",126,383,2137,3.0,7/27/2015,"I have always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory - great food (dinner and cakes) but I came in for breakfast and this was one of my least favorite meals. We stayed at the hotel right next to the mall, and usually we do have breakfast at the hotel were I enjoy potatoes and scrambled eggs. This time we decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory. I never had breakfast here before but I absolutely love their dinner dishes like salads, tamale, etc., and of course the cakes. Anyways, in my opinion this is not a good place for breakfast. First, breakfast items on the menu are pretty expensive, the portions are small and the quality (plus, the wait!) is not worth the money. Breakfast cost about $12 and it had 2 eggs (scrambled, my choice), 3 slices of tomatoes and brick hard, over fried potatoes, that were very oily. I love potatoes, I even order mash potatoes on the side, but I think these were the worst potatoes. Not only they were oily, they were almost burned, so hard I could not stick a fork in them. When I asked the waitress why potatoes are so hard and tiny, she said ""That's the way they are here!"" Hmmm.. ok, good to know. As for my husbands dish, he ordered Eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon and it came out with oily (I guess it's American style) bacon with almost no meat, just fat. She did apologize though and bought out the right bacon on a side. So I'm giving two stars for my visit here because I liked my scrambled eggs. We also ordered a cake to go. Have to admit, that Oreo Cheesecake was way, way too sweet, so no extra star here. P.S. I think that Cheesecake Factory should learn how to cook breakfast potatoes. I prefer Denny's potatoes that are crispy from outside and soft from inside. I can actually chew them without breaking my tooth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=40

I might not enjoy how crowded it usually is and how long it sometimes takes for the whole experience, but I still like their food and desserts. Who am I kidding? I'd prob be happy if I only had their breads (I love bread and theirs is pretty yummy) and desserts!  Their menu has so many things to choose from, it's def hard to pick a favorite item. We've tried their burgers, pastas, quesadillas, shepherds pie and several appetizers. One of my fav dishes from here  is the Parmesan crusted chicken Romano. It's a great dish to share since it brings 2 chicken breasts and enough pasta for two. When it comes to desserts I have to go with their dulce de leche or carrot cake cheesecakes. Omg!

We got only the first 2 and the mushrooms never came. Our server took our order then he didn't show up back to the table until it was time to pay. We were really thirsty, never got a water refill.

Carine N.,"New River, AZ",57,162,,3.0,4/9/2017,1st:  We love Cheesecake Factory-just NOT this one.  We were at the Dolphin Mall as part of our pre-cruise adventure and decided to have our early dinner there b/f we got back on our bus to go back to our hotel.   It was actually our first disappointing experience w/ any of them!  Waiter treated us as if it was a burden to do his job and barely spoke to us.  Payed more attention to his phone (which we have never seen any employee ever do at one before!).  We sat outside and the upholstery on the seating looked as if it was way past its prime.  Food was just okay-not the usual Yum! we've always experienced from Cheesecake factory.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=20

Chiyon Y.,"Miami, FL",218,216,750,2.0,9/14/2016,"I have a love/hate relationship with Cheesecake Factory. It's consistent... always busy, never clean, mediocre service, good food but terrible presentation, etc. etc. etc. Food-wise, the flavors are there. I mean, with all that fat, there better be flavor. I pretty much like everything I've had at Cheesecake, again, Fat = Flavor.  This review is a reflection of my last visit this past weekend, in which I had the worst items I've experience in 15+ years at dining at Cheesecake.  --- The Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls were the worse I've ever had. They were pre-rolled and sitting out for a loooong time, because those rice wrappers were hard as a rock. Each roll had 1/2 a shrimp!!!  --- The Eggroll Sampler... oily as expected, but there's a right way to fry food that won't taste overly oily. Not complaining about the oiliness, but the Firecracker Salmon in the sampler was extremely disappointing. Salmon in only 1/3 of the eggroll, and definitely not as advertised on the website.  I felt like I was robbed on both these items, not worth the price & definitely never ordering these again! 1 star for the service, better than most time. Kudos to our sweaty server!  1 star for the bread... I could eat their bread all day, every day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=20

Alexandra F.,"Miami, FL",32,6,1,3.0,9/24/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the restaurants I like to go back as I am rarely disappointed. Menu is very large and there is something for everyone. My personal favorites are tuna tartare and the flatbreads. They are fresh and flavorful. Since this restaurant is always busy, the turnover makes every ingredient the freshest. The cheesecakes are awesome. But let's be honest, service is sometimes good, sometimes bad, depending on your server.  The place is always always busy so it is very noisy inside but they have a nice outdoor terrasse, where I prefer to sit. The cleanliness is not always good, when you visit the bathrooms or see how the bussers clean up the tables. Overall, good value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=20

Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",937,1409,6947,3.0,10/5/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, what's not love?  It has gluttonous portions and tasty desserts. That's all I ask for when I go there and this location is no different than the rest. Located in Dolphin Mall, this location has indoor and outdoor seating options. Parking can be a little tricky because of its location but just think, you're gonna need to burn calories after this meal. The service was good. Our waiter, Paul was very friendly and helped us pick out an app which was the Mac and cheese balls. They were amazing. Our meals arrived sporadically as if they were made in different kitchens. My order of chicken nachos were pretty tasty- and I'm telling myself they are calorie free. The bathrooms though were absolutely disgusting. Toilets stuffed with, well, you get the idea.

Jadhai C.,"Miami, FL",11,81,187,2.0,5/13/2016,"I had been looking forward to trying out the ""NEW"" Cheesecake Factory at Dolphin, not too sure if it's worth a second trip when Texas de Brazil is right next door with the oozing smells that creep up on you in all the right ways. It was my birthday Brunch. We got seated at the ending of the outdoor patio next to OTHER people eating when there was multiple empty seating in between. The waitress asked us mid way through leaving through the door ""do you want bread?"" I wish she would of just brought it instead of asking the way she did so casually. We were brought sourdough and another type of bread. It was so stale it could break a tooth, and oh boy did it. Mid chew... I realized that a tooth I had a root canal on had completely chipped off. That's how freaking hard that bread was. Super disappointed. We ordered Evelyn's Favorite Lunch Pasta and a Chipotle Pasta from the Lunch special as well. For some reason my Evelyn's pasta was nowhere near evenly coated. The noodles looked dried, and the sauce to one side. And it was extremely room temperature. Yet the Chipotle Pasta was super HOT. So obviously mine was left out to wait for his pasta to come out. I believe if I remember correctly... The waitress only asked us once if we were okay. I don't know, but there was not anything special about this place. Sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=20

It is located at the heart of the Dolphin Mall so it is surrounded by music, people milling about, or just sitting listening to the music playing in the main courtyard. It is spacious, so usually the wait is not too bad on a busy day. The food is very good, reasonably priced, and you get large portions so you will leave fulfilled!

However, I had not been there in a couple of years and decided to visit because I was craving their Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Getting there is a struggle because this restaurant is located in Dolphin Mall and if you've never been there, beware! Parking is always a mission, especially on weekends. We spent about 30 minutes trying to find parking. When we finally got to the restaurant we were lucky enough to be seated quickly because there were two of us and we were willing to sit outside. Luckily it wasn't too hot. The waiter was kind but because there are so many items on the menu (over 250!) or maybe they were new, it took us a while to order. I also love that they now have the calorie information for every item. This is something we took into consideration as well when making our choices. Our food took a reasonable amount of time and I am very appreciative that they were able to remove mushrooms from my pasta as I cannot eat them. Overall it was a very good dinner but I feel their outside area could use more attention since it is so hot in Miami and the booth we sat in was a bit dirty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=20

Kiki I.,"Doral, FL",0,4,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Loved in the past tense I how I describe how i feel about the Cheesecake Factory.  The 12th St restaurant provided one of the worst dining experiences I had in a long time:  Waited 55 minutes to get our food and only after I got up and asked the manager if there was something wrong in the kitchen and when we did get our food it was truly bad.   Some details of the night - We sat a table that was not clean.  The waitress was friendly but knew nothing about service.  We got our drinks but never asked again if we wanted others, our water glasses were empty until we asked for more water, and our salad was served after we had our main course which was an hour after we sat. The chicken Madeira looked like it has been dropped and then sat on the hot lamp for 50 minutes, which is probably what happened.  The cheese which normally sits on top of the chicken was melted on the side of the plate and the Madeira sauce was so dry it did not want to come off the plate (I actually took a picture of how bad this presentation was).  Very few time in my life have I sent back a plate, but this was bad enough that I did and lost my appetite.   My wife order the usual Jambalaya which was not as usual - this one was dry and the noddles were stuck together like when pasta is overcooked.  I think this plate sat under the hot lamp too long as well. The manager tried to make up for the dining experience by offering us free cheesecakes but lost the meaning of the apology when she and the waitress were laughing and pointing at us when she did not realize we were watching her. I will never return to this Cheesecake Factory and if others go via this same route, I will easily take my business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=60

My friends got a table and we joined them later. Let's start off by saying that the server greeted us as soon as we sat down and took our drink orders. We then ordered appetizers and our meals right before the drinks came. I'm not sure if it was because the restaurant was full (mind you it was Tuesday) or the kitchen was under staffed but out food took really long. We got another round of drinks by the time the appetizers came, and another before our meal arrived. What saved the night was that our server was being super attentive and was nice enough to bring us more bread and butter refills. I ordered a Cobb salad with crispy chicken and it was very delicious but it was HUGE! None of my friends had any complains about their food either. Tried their salted caramel cheesecake for the first time and I'm ranking it on top of the Oreo one. They even wrote happy birthday on my boyfriend's cheesecake! Overall a great experience.

Kimberly K.,"Miami, FL",934,183,389,4.0,5/20/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE restaurant! It's reasonably priced food with large amounts! 4-6pm it happy hour, and ironically I happened to be there for that. My boyfriend and I shared the Chinese chicken salad (or maybe it's called Asian chicken salad?) as an appetizer while waiting for our friend, Priscilla to arrive. I ordered the lunch portion, knowing the dinner is ginormous. I never order salads anywhere else except THIS particular salad at cheesecake cause it's literally THE BEST SALAD IVE EVER HAD! Wonton crisps, fresh romaine, crispy stringy chip things, mandarin oranges, almond shavings, lots of chicken, cheesecake's exclusive plum dressing, SOOO AMAZING.  as the entree, we ordered their Parmesan crushed chicken Romano. I've had it before and it's delicious but for some reason... It was too salty today :/ not sure if it's the chef or location... But I'm disappointed. Anyway, cheesecake only does happy hour at the bar so we paid at our table for our meals and moved over to their bar for dessert and drinks :P I ordered their lemonade which had skyy vodka and YOWZA they sure were friendly with that vodka and I for $5. Haha! needless to say, I definitely needed to order a cheesecake to take care of that drink. Also, I never leave without ordering a cheesecake! It's so worth it. I love trying a new one each time. Today, we all shared their Godiva. YUMMMYYY. The top is powdered with cocoa, the middle is a layer of dark chocolate cheesecake and a cream. The bottom is moist chocolate cake. All made out of Godica chocolate, of course. And there was a PERFECT Godiva chocolate sqaure to garnish the top. I would order this cheesecake again and recommend everyone to as well! Same goes for the Chinese chicken salad. As for the Romano dish... Eh... Try it at another location hahha",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=60

Of the three times ive gone once i had great service, Tony; the other two times i had others servers and they just appeared very tired, still there for us but not too helpful or attentive. The appetizers were pretty good, yummy sweet tamales. So was the tuna tartare. For the pastas its a hit or miss, i ve had great pasta and I've had the blandest of them. Some pasta with shrimp in a tomato sauce that tasted like nothing, i think it didnt even had salt. The salads are tasty though, and good portions too.  As of cheesecakes well, you can imagine. Large variety, several of them delicious.  If its not a day to spend too much id come here, id just be careful to make good choices. Hence, i suggest you ask your server for recommendations.

Martin S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",5,10,,3.0,6/27/2016,"The lowdown on the Cheescake Factory: A plethora of menu items, acceptable quality of food, and sub-par service.  Sometimes it is difficult to decide what to order at this restaurant chain because there are so many items to choose from. Don't get too bogged down in the menu, and choose whatever you feel like eating. I had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. The sauce was overly watery, but didn't detract from the meal too much. It lacked that explosion of flavor, though. The thing that irked me the most was the service. I got to the restaurant around 4:00 PM and was seated within five minutes. About ten minutes later, another party was seated next to mine. Their server took their order before mine, who didn't come for another ten minutes. I also had to ask for utensils and bread, which should be commonplace among all of these restaurants.

I reluctantly agreed to come to the one at Dolphin Mall. Why reluctantly? Because I dislike the mall. It's always packed with children, tourists, and the worst thing.... the parking it's a mission! I was thinking ""Ok... we will be waiting for a good 40 minutes or more."" and... .Oh was I proven wrong! They told us the wait was going to be 15 minutes and it literally took us like 10 minutes to get seated. I ordered the soup of the day ""Cream of Chicken Soup."" It was EXQUISITE! But that was not all. I also ordered the ""White Chicken Chili"" which I've had one other time in the past along with a passion iced tea.  My friend J.C. ordered the Island Grilled Chicken. When she read the ingredients and saw that the chicken was glazed with soy she became skeptical. I told her to give it a try. That if it tasted bad to blame it on me (as if that would fix the problem if it truly tasted bad right?). Anyway, she was really pleased with her selection and the chicken was actually very flavorful, tender, and juicy. HEY J.C.! - JUICY MOUTHED! LOL Her husband A.C., ordered one of his favorite plates Chicken Alfredo (it suits him right) lol. He said it was great as well. Although it was literally showered with grated cheese because he did not tell the poor waiter to stop grating cheese until after what seemed to be like a whole two minutes. Poor waiter!

I've always loved eating at The Cheesecake Factory...well, almost always. You'll love eating here; that is, if you can bypass paying a few dollars more for dishes including those you can find at other restaurants. It was an early Monday evening, but my family, friend and I got a table in seconds. Expect most of the tables to be taken when you come in the evening. Huge parties of people would come here for birthdays. Our party sat at a four-person table while I took an extra chair. The restaurant interior is one of the most intricate and distinctive restaurant interiors I've ever seen - so classy and top-notch. I also like the Picasso-style art over the kitchen. The Cheesecake Factory has the widest variety of food I've ever seen in a menu: burgers and sandwiches, pasta, tacos, chicken, steak, seafood, salads, as well as reduced-calorie SkinnyLicious options. I like that most of their dishes are unique - maybe that explains why their menus are so big, and that people come here so often. It's unlikely that you'll find these dishes anywhere else. Dad had the Avocado Eggrolls. My brother had pasta. Mom and our friend Francesse had the Sheila's Chicken and Avocado Salad. I had the Baja Chicken Tacos with rice and black beans. All the food has been artfully and well-prepared, and it all tasted great. However, I don't understand why the portions are huge! We talked amongst ourselves, saying that while the portions are huge, they have gotten only slightly smaller from the last few times we've been at the Factory. For dessert, we, of course, shared a slice of cheesecake - the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Again, unique and delicious. The waiters are studious in their jobs. They are to be commended for being focused at all times, accurately following instructions, and being courteous of the customers: as I was sitting in the extra chair, the waiter forgot to get me an extra fork, knife, napkin, etc. When I brought it up with him, he apologized. I needed cutlery and a napkin, so I vaguely asked another waiter to bring me a ""fork and knife"", but that's exactly what he brought me, so I also asked for a napkin. Our party didn't want refills, but the good thing is our waiter asked if we wanted any. The Cheesecake Factory is one of the best places to eat at in groups - maybe celebrate your next birthday here? That way, you all can share the dining experience together. To save money, I recommend only coming here once in a while. Expect to spend about $20 to $30 per person, which includes an entrée, drink, then consider an appetizer/dessert. It's well worth your money, though.

Highly recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2
Justin M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",490,11,21,3.0,1/13/2018,"So I hate to say I was disappointed coming here even though I am a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. It may have just been this location if anything. We went on a day when it was dead empty and we were seated fairly quickly. I saw alot of waiters walking around but it took forever for us to get one. Once we did get our water we were able to order our food.  Food & Service  We started off with the Buffalo Blasts since I've had them from the Cheesecake Factory back in NY and they were phenomenal! The ones I got here were burnt to a crisp and I felt like I was eating something made in a rush. There were some pieces that were good but most of them were on the burnt end of the spectrum. We also had gotten a wrong order of food brought to us but atleast they were able to bring out the right dish really quick due to the hiccup. The grilled salmon I got was good but I wouldn't say it was amazing compared to other places that I've been. My main complaint was that the service at this place was EXTREMELY slow for a day where only a few tables were taken so I was really disappointed with that. - 1 star for the burnt Buffalo Blasts and another - 1 for the very slow service. Thank You for taking the time to read my review and I'd appreciate it if you would follow me on my food instagram, drop a like and a follow!

Annie A.,"Montreal, Canada",7,44,69,3.0,11/30/2017,"I was excited to try the Cheesecake Factory as we don't have any in Canada and have heard so much about it. The actual restaurant is nice and well maintained. I was happy we were seated on the outside patio as the weather that day was perfect. We tried a few different appetizers that were all to die for: the crispy fried cheese, the avocado eggrolls and the fried zucchini. The mains were a different story. I had Evelyn's pasta, although it was good, it didn't justify the price tag. Others in our group had the salmon, fish tacos, grilled cheese, fried chicken strips and a veggie burger. No one was wowed with their food, all of the people who ordered fried dishes commented that the food was oily making me think their oil wasn't hot enough. I tried my son's chicken tenders and they were bland along with having absorbed way too much of the frying oil.  Service on the other hand was outstanding. I'd be willing to give them another try but I think I'd just order appetizers and try some dessert next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2

Lynette M.,"Miami, FL",226,98,258,4.0,7/31/2017,"I found out from some co workers that it was national cheesecake day, and they explained to me how it works so pretty much when you purchase a slice of a cheesecake you get half off the price of the cheesecake. So I was amazed from hearing about that so I decided to go after work, and gave it a stop by on my way home. But what I did was I called to order a sliced of the "" raspberry white chocolate truffles "" when I was about 3-4 mins away from the location. As soon as I got there they charged me immediately, and hand it to me even though it was extremely packed inside.  -The location is in dolphin mall, and regarding parking you have more than enough spots to station your car including a parking garage.  -Another thing is that amazed me was hearing from one of the employees that this is their 9th year doing this event.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2

Honestly, the food was great, and the restaurant was not very busy we went around 6:30pm. Our server took 30 minutes to bring out our cheesecake and then about another 15 minutes to bring us our check.

We were seated outside as asked with 40 minutes of our arrival, when we were seated we noticed a table of like 20 pre teens being loud and disruptive, now I have nothing bad to say about loudness because I'm pretty loud but they were over the top and no one told them anything this is supposed to be a romantic restaurant and to me that's unacceptable shame on the manager!  We ordered the crab wontons, and I must say the filling is delicious it is well cooked soft and has plenty of crab but the outside was extremely burnt. Then the pasta my husband and I both ordered pastas and when they came to the table they looked more like soup, this restaurant is known for big portions and I have to say the plate was huge but it was all sauce followed by a spoonful of pasta and a couple of pieces of chicken.  The only good part of the dinner was the cheesecake, which unfortunately had the macadamia nuts frozen!!!  At least I enjoyed it once I took off the nuts. On a good note out waiter tony was very nice and made sure we had plenty of bread and that are drinks were always full. Thank you tony!!!

However, I waited 15 minutes to be greeted once I sat down, it was as if I wasn't there. This place was not busy... AT ALL. By the time my waiter came i was ready for my full order. They had just opened so I expected some fresh warm bread my favorite at any Cheesecake Factory. The bread was stale and cold. I asked for a water no ice with lemon instead I was given a glass of water that was appropriate for some tea boiling. Took another 30 minutes... 30 whole minutes for my food to arrive. This literally made my blood boil, I had just ordered a plain seared tuna salad. How they managed to make this take so long I will never understand this isn't even a cooked menu item. When i finally got my salad after my waiter, who was quite nice, apologized for the delay I couldn't wait to dig in. Until I realize that the tuna was old. I just ate the greens and left the tuna untouched. I pointed this out to my waiter who ten proceeded with a crapy excuse. Seriously the worst Cheesecake Factory I've stepped foot on.

I did not read the discription and this was a quater chicken and i was expection a chicken breast, but not to worry because the dish did not disappoint at alllll!  The perfect seasoning to the chicken of lemon and herb was magnificent!  The chicken was not dry, the mash potatoes were a bit cool but the vegtables were very good.

Bobby was friendly fast and very knowledgeable ! I had the Chicken and biscuits with coffee and THE STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE! Yes , I yelled it! It was that good!   First the entree , this once was a monster of a meal. There was enough for two meals and drenched in thick awesome gravy.  This time around, the size was pared down but all the classic ingredients were still present, the pan fried crusted chicken breast, the house made biscuit, fluffy mashed potatoes and tastes carrots, peas and mushrooms lightly covered in a thinner less creamy gravy. I am sure my waistline appreciates the smaller portions and so does my taste buds. They were screaming for mercy  later after the decedent short cake. A tower of sweet candies strawberries atop creamy vanilla ice cream placed between a huge fluffy biscuit and topped with a pyramid of whipped cream that a pharaoh would envy. Who should think that a dessert this great would rival the namesake of this establishment? and the proverbial icing on the cake . My sweet Bobby, she was such a joy. My coworkers salad was not as ordered and she didn't even let the plate touch the table before she took it and replaced it with the correct item.

Keith P.,"Washington, DC",563,629,328,4.0,12/12/2012,"THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! YES!!!! Known for their classy, delicious, and trendy desserts! ................................ Before I continue with this review, I would just like to say that it is very difficult to review chain restaurants because they are the same. They are all run the same, have the same setup/décor, and most importantly serve the same food. And that is the truth at all of Cheesecake Factories +100 locations. However, since I would like to offer as much information as possible, I would like to compare this Cheesecake Factory to the other popular Cheesecake Factory in South Florida--- the one at Dadeland Mall. (Note: there is also one in Coconut Grove.) _______________________ DADELAND CHEESECAKE VS. DOLPHIN MALL CHEESECAKE: Which one stacks up better? Which one is better? Where should you go? Location: Dadeland is the mall for the classy and those who want to spend money. Dolphin Mall is the home for those who like to shop on a budget--they do have outlet stores after all. Also, since the mall is bigger it has more parking for its cheesecake enthusiasts, so ONE POINT easily goes to DOLPHIN MALL CHEESECAKE. Service: When I went to Dolphin Mall Cheesecake, they were really slow. I am not sure if it was because they just got trained or were nervous, but our food was slow to come out. I think someone may have made a mistake in the kitchen. But my water glass was always full because once I took a sip, the waitress was back to fill my cup. At Dadeland Cheesecake, service is relatively fast, but they have messed up my food order a couple of times which made them take longer. TIE IN THIS CATEGORY! Food: Same food, love their cheesecakes. My favorite dish is the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Superb taste of coconut! The Skinnylicious menu is offered at both locations for those on a diet. TIE AGAIN! Space: It is rumored that the Cheesecake Factory at Dadeland is expanding. But even without the rumored expansion, the one at Dadeland definitely has more space. The Cheesecake Factory at Dolphin has more outside space, but the seating in the inside just doesn't match up to the one at Dadeland. ONE POINT goes to DADELAND CHEESECAKE. AND WHAT DO WE HAVE?! A TIE!!!! In conclusion, I would say both of these Cheesecake Factories have their pros and cons. Both have good food. If you are looking to shop for a day, go to the one at Dolphin Mall to take advantage of their prices. If you want a faster reservation due to amount of space, go to Dadeland. Space at this Cheesecake Factory may be especially limited because the mall gets really busy at night, but overall, I like how this chain is expanding because I do love my Cheesecake! I would definitely come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=100

Abby D.,"Miami, FL",219,11,,2.0,5/20/2016,"I am giving this place two stars not because the food and drinks were bad, but because the service was not good. I came here with my coworkers for our monthly happy hour, and when we entered we were immediately seated in the dining area without even being given the choice. When we spoke to the manager (Freddy) in regards to charging us happy hour prices in the dinning area he said no; understandable, but the way he came across was not pleasing. Once in the bar area, we got our drinks, appetizers, and food, but felt a lack of attention from our waitress. Our waters were not refilled and we had to ask multiple times for the status on our drinks and food. Once the bill came, we had to send them back because all happy hour specials were priced at regular price. In addition, a coworker of mine ordered a virgin mojito and was priced the same amount for an alcoholic one! When we brought this up to our waitress' attention she stated that the manager was not going to give her a discounted price. She received a discount on the drink ONLY when I asked for his name. In conclusion, we will not be coming back to this location for happy hour. You should not have to beg for good service to be given.

We got the best table where you can comfortably fit six people!! The service was friendly and efficient and the general ambience was pretty   mom ordered the harvest salad its lean and healthy (if you take out the dressing) which is what my mom did, my cousin ordered the Mexican salad from the skinnylicious menu which let me tell you IT IS HUUUUGE but really satisfying, and I ordered the Tuscan chicken without the farro and I really like it, it is not so big but once again very satisfying. Overall it's a good restaurant for a family meal. We loved the brown bread it is just sooo good so we ordered to take the rest home and they gave us more for free! Once we were finished with the food we were debating whether or not to ordered a dessert but sorry not this time, it's just way too much sugar and fat in once single slice.

They had a few quality control issues - some corn in my spinach, and one order was lost. I ordered a steak medium rare but it was well done, although not bad. The grilled broccoli was almost raw. It was a holiday and they were rushed and dos accommodate a large party and I am sure on other occasions they will do better. It's just ok as far as cheesecake factories go, and it's decent but not great. The server was very nice and attentive. For the price it's probably worth the money. The main course food was hot and cooked to order ; but the appetizers were not (nachos) and looked like they had been under a heat lamp. The salad looked fresh.

Than I ordered the shrimp Blt the shrimp were not cleaned at all, and we had some sort or stick object that we couldn't make out what it was. I informed the server and showed him what we found and he looked baffled did not know what is was either.

Our food took way too long, no refills at all through out the night, and my chicken Marsala was not good at all. It was soooooooo greasy. Like the bow tie pasta was literally dripping oil.

Iris C.,"Miami, FL",203,49,288,2.0,1/22/2014,"Came here twice, and you would think it would be like any other cheesecake factory experience, but it's not. First of all, the service here is super slow, I understand that the restaurant is located at Dolphin mall which has more foot traffic when compared to Dadeland, but still the service and quality shouldn't change.  The first time I came here, we ordered the tomato basil pasta, and the pasta was under cooked. The waitress tried to play it off stating that it was ""al dente"" but it was far from being ""al dente"" so the waitress took it back to the chef, and they supposedly made us a new plate. Unfortunately, when the plate came out, it literally looked as if they dumped our plate of pasta into boiling water and just pour sauce over it again.  On the other hand, the ahi carpaccio was delicious, the fish was fresh, and I would definitely recommend this dish.  The second time here, we ordered the buffalo wings, and the fried calamari. The fried calamari was delicious, and it was very light and not heavily battered. Before we ordered the wings, we asked our waitress how many wings the plate comes with, and we were told 10 wings. When the dish came out, it was 8 wings and half were burnt. . We asked the waitress if she could exchange the burnt ones, she told my boyfriend to eat one, and she took the rest back. When it came back out, it was only 5 wings on the plate. We confronted our waitress, and she immediately asked, how many wings we have already eaten, and even checked under our plates. She then took it back it back to the kitchen again, and when it was brought back out she said that they weigh the wings by 10 ounces...after she already said it was 10 pieces of wings...so we paid $11.50 for basically 6 little wings. To replace the 4 missing wings from the order, our waitress brought out fries. meh.

When you open up the menu, it kind of overwhelms you. There is page after page of delicious food options. To start, we order the sausage and ricotta flat bread. Wow, that was good! Since it was lunch, I ordered a Cobb Salad, nothing fancy, but geez the portion was huge (I dig that, get my money's worth) my husband ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, which he enjoyed (and I did as well lol)  We decided to skip dessert cause we were stuffed, but don't!!

Maple P.,"Miami, FL",0,21,47,4.0,10/10/2015,"One can never resist the desserts at The Cheesecake Factory. Try one and you will never regret the calories that were gained. Came with a party of 8. The hostess said the wait would be an hour long and gave us one of the beepers. It toke exactly one hour for us to get seated. Got here at 6:05pm and got seated at 7:05pm. Our waiter was a very sociable and energetic person. He immediately toke our drinks. I got strawberry lemonade. It was $4.95, the glass holding the lemonade has cystal sugar along the top lining. When ordering the entrées, the waiter would make a positive side comment on how the food choice we were making was excellent. Got annoying after he got the 5th order out of the 8. The waiter gave us 1 basket of bread with butter on a side plate. The bread basket comes with 2 mini loaf of wheat bread and 1 mini loaf of white bread. The white bread's crust was too hard, not burnt hard, but the hard that results when the time between baking the bread and eating it is long. On the other hand, the wheat bread was crispy, I could easy cut into this bread, and the inside was still warm and chewy. We got our food around 7:45 so it was like a 35 minute wait from ordering to receiving food. I got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Note: the lighting is weird inside the restaurant. The lights give off as a shade of orange so everything in the restaurant looks like it's a shade of orange. When I got my pasta entrée I could not tell if I had gotten chicken or shrimp as the meat because the lighting made my entire dish orange colored, but once I tasted it, I could tell that it was chicken. Also, when it says SPICY Chicken Chipotle Pasta, it literally means spicy. I love spicy food no matter how extreme the spiciness is, but as a warning, don't get this platter if you do not like extremely spicy food (from 1 to 10, this is a level 9 spiciness). The waiter was around every now and then to make sure everything was good. When it came to getting boxes for our leftovers, we 1st asked for 3 boxes, but then realized we needed more. Gladly, the waiter didn't seem to mind making 2 more trips for boxes and bags.

I had the Strawberry Creamsicle, which in essence was a heavenly ""spiked"" milkshake, while my gf enjoyed ""The Ritz"" martini.      For our main course we ordered their ""most famous dish"", Chicken Madeira, for myself, & the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken for my gf.. As usual, our dishes were bursting with flavor and go highly recommended. As our dessert, we selected the traditional strawberry cheesecake (which was enough for 3 people) topped with their own ""in-house made"" whipped cream. We weren't a huge fan of the glazed strawberry flavor, but it didn't stop us from cleaning the plate. Next time, we will be sure to try one of their other 20 plus varieties of cheesecake.       Overall, our waiter was attentive, the ambiance was relaxing & the food was delicious.

Our pasta was undercooked, watery and the chicken in the fettuccini looked like it was boiled rather than grilled and my husband's pizza was chewy. Not even my kids liked it, they didn't have the crayons and coloring paper that they usually give to kids in restaurants to keep them entertained. I am very disappointed and I will never go back, I rather eat at Olive Garden or Macaroni and Grill.

First off, I savored their comp bread - yummyyy lol, then I ordered one of my favorite dishes, turkey and avocado sandwich from their skinnilicious menu with garden salad switched for a Cesar. It was absolutely delicious!! I definitely recommend trying items in their skinnilicious menu to save some calories and not sacrifice flavor! I always find their Cesar salad to be amazing; however, this time found it was way too heavily dressed so heads up if you order one at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=140

Came by on a Saturday night recently and the wait was about 45 minutes, not a problem since we went and had a beer at BWW. Where i did encounter a problem was in my beloved (always order the same thing) pasta. I always order the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic...mind you this time around it came with pieces of shrimp and the tomatos were in big chunks (and this is after the meal took forever) I usually dont complain about food, because God knows what they do back there when you return the food. But I did mention to the server about the meal and she immidiately told the food manager (did not catch his name), who was just AWESOME about the whole ordeal. So because of that I will go back and order my pasta again ;) Oh and the Sweet Corn Tamale cakes were on point! YUM",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=140

Now I'm not saying that the food at Cheesecake Factory is good for you...because it is far from that...but it is freakin' delicious! I came to this new location with some friends and I was slightly disappointed because the dish I really wanted was no longer on the menu (Chicken & Biscuits).  So I looked over the menu for a while, which is a bit daunting because its pretty extensive...but I finally landed on a burger. This was not just any burger though. This particular burger had one of their deep fried mac and cheese balls smooshed on top of it and then more cheddar cheese is drizzled on top of that...then they add the other bun. When I read that on the menu...the little fat kid inside me started doing cartwheels! Needless to say, the burger was a mess...but that was expected..and welcomed.

The good was not the best I've tasted from the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered my usual which was the bistro shrimp pasta and the taste was awful. There was no zesty flavor and not enough cream. My nieces order the four cheese pasta and it looked like pasta mixed with a can of tomato sauce. My second ordered the chicken Romano and the chicken tastes like it was boiled with bread crumbs on top.  The good thing about this place was that our server was nice and very attentive.

Natalie A.,"Miami, FL",0,15,,3.0,8/2/2015,"I usually have wonderful experiences at The Cheesecake Factory, but I had never been to the one at Dolphin and it was a very underwhelming experience, unfortunately. First off, too many tourists. They walk in with the enormous suitcases that they just purchased at the mall and take up all the room in the tiny lobby of the restaurant. The doors are opened so frequently that the lobby is more of a sauna; full of hot air and it feels disgusting. Plus, the constant wind from the door opening does nothing good for your hair. Don't ever wait for your table in there; it's better to wait outside. Second: Dirty, dirty, dirty. I joked with my boyfriend that the restaurant was so dimly lit because they wanted to try to cover up how dirty everything actually is, and I probably wasn't too far off. The floor by our table was disgusting; crumbs and God knows what else all over the place, and my boyfriend said his side of the floor felt wet. Two bussers came to clean up the table next to us after the family had left and did what can only be called a mediocre job. My boyfriend used to be a busser, and he was shaking his head the whole time as he watched in horror how they ""cleaned"" the table. What looked like a dirty cloth was carelessly swiped across the table a few times, and then the CLEAN utensils were placed directly onto the table (with no napkin or plate beneath them) by the bare hands of the second busser, who was grabbing the utensils by the part you put your food on. Gross. My boyfriend said that bussers probably have the dirtiest hands next to the dishwashers (because they are the ones that pick up the dirty plates and cups when everyone leaves), and these were the guys touching the clean utensils people were about to eat with. Why not wrap up the utensils in napkins like every other restaurant? Needless to say I was a little disgusted.  Granted, we went on a Saturday night to Dolphin Mall (always a mistake because of parking, crowds, and wait times) so service was not the best. I told the waitress to give me max five minutes to decide on what I wanted to order, and she avoided our table for the next fifteen minutes. She was kind, always made sure we had water, and brought me extra cheese for my pasta immediately. But, she took a long time in coming around to take our orders and it was hard to get her attention to come to our table. I can only complain about one aspect of the food; the complimentary bread that they brought was stale. We were given one of each bread, and the white one was hard as a rock. You could tell it wasn't made fresh, that loaf had been sitting somewhere for hours and that's what they brought us. The other loaf was warm and soft; that's how you know.  Our meals were delicious because you can't go wrong with anything at the Cheesecake Factory. The plates are enormous and you will definitely leave in a food coma. The cheesecakes are delicious and big enough to split between two people (although my boyfriend claimed he could have finished the mango key lime cheesecake all by himself). I have no complaints about our food, it was great, but the overall experience was not what I had anticipated from this restaurant. I think it's just the location and the fact that it was a Saturday night, but the mediocre cleaning done by bussers is something to worry about. I'll stick to the Dadeland location for future outings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=140

Kiki I.,"Doral, United States",0,4,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Loved in the past tense I how I describe how i feel about the Cheesecake Factory.  The 12th St restaurant provided one of the worst dining experiences I had in a long time:  Waited 55 minutes to get our food and only after I got up and asked the manager if there was something wrong in the kitchen and when we did get our food it was truly bad.   Some details of the night - We sat a table that was not clean.  The waitress was friendly but knew nothing about service.  We got our drinks but never asked again if we wanted others, our water glasses were empty until we asked for more water, and our salad was served after we had our main course which was an hour after we sat. The chicken Madeira looked like it has been dropped and then sat on the hot lamp for 50 minutes, which is probably what happened.  The cheese which normally sits on top of the chicken was melted on the side of the plate and the Madeira sauce was so dry it did not want to come off the plate (I actually took a picture of how bad this presentation was).  Very few time in my life have I sent back a plate, but this was bad enough that I did and lost my appetite.   My wife order the usual Jambalaya which was not as usual - this one was dry and the noddles were stuck together like when pasta is overcooked.  I think this plate sat under the hot lamp too long as well. The manager tried to make up for the dining experience by offering us free cheesecakes but lost the meaning of the apology when she and the waitress were laughing and pointing at us when she did not realize we were watching her. I will never return to this Cheesecake Factory and if others go via this same route, I will easily take my business elsewhere.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=60

My friends got a table and we joined them later. Let's start off by saying that the server greeted us as soon as we sat down and took our drink orders. We then ordered appetizers and our meals right before the drinks came. I'm not sure if it was because the restaurant was full (mind you it was Tuesday) or the kitchen was under staffed but out food took really long. We got another round of drinks by the time the appetizers came, and another before our meal arrived. What saved the night was that our server was being super attentive and was nice enough to bring us more bread and butter refills. I ordered a Cobb salad with crispy chicken and it was very delicious but it was HUGE! None of my friends had any complains about their food either. Tried their salted caramel cheesecake for the first time and I'm ranking it on top of the Oreo one. They even wrote happy birthday on my boyfriend's cheesecake! Overall a great experience.

Kimberly K.,"Miami, United States",934,183,392,4.0,20/5/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE restaurant! It's reasonably priced food with large amounts! 4-6pm it happy hour, and ironically I happened to be there for that. My boyfriend and I shared the Chinese chicken salad (or maybe it's called Asian chicken salad?) as an appetizer while waiting for our friend, Priscilla to arrive. I ordered the lunch portion, knowing the dinner is ginormous. I never order salads anywhere else except THIS particular salad at cheesecake cause it's literally THE BEST SALAD IVE EVER HAD! Wonton crisps, fresh romaine, crispy stringy chip things, mandarin oranges, almond shavings, lots of chicken, cheesecake's exclusive plum dressing, SOOO AMAZING.  as the entree, we ordered their Parmesan crushed chicken Romano. I've had it before and it's delicious but for some reason... It was too salty today :/ not sure if it's the chef or location... But I'm disappointed. Anyway, cheesecake only does happy hour at the bar so we paid at our table for our meals and moved over to their bar for dessert and drinks :P I ordered their lemonade which had skyy vodka and YOWZA they sure were friendly with that vodka and I for $5. Haha! needless to say, I definitely needed to order a cheesecake to take care of that drink. Also, I never leave without ordering a cheesecake! It's so worth it. I love trying a new one each time. Today, we all shared their Godiva. YUMMMYYY. The top is powdered with cocoa, the middle is a layer of dark chocolate cheesecake and a cream. The bottom is moist chocolate cake. All made out of Godica chocolate, of course. And there was a PERFECT Godiva chocolate sqaure to garnish the top. I would order this cheesecake again and recommend everyone to as well!

The appetizers were pretty good, yummy sweet tamales. So was the tuna tartare. For the pastas its a hit or miss, i ve had great pasta and I've had the blandest of them. Some pasta with shrimp in a tomato sauce that tasted like nothing, i think it didnt even had salt. The salads are tasty though, and good portions too.  As of cheesecakes well, you can imagine. Large variety, several of them delicious.  If its not a day to spend too much id come here, id just be careful to make good choices. Hence, i suggest you ask your server for recommendations.

Sometimes it is difficult to decide what to order at this restaurant chain because there are so many items to choose from. Don't get too bogged down in the menu, and choose whatever you feel like eating. I had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. The sauce was overly watery, but didn't detract from the meal too much. It lacked that explosion of flavor, though. The thing that irked me the most was the service. I got to the restaurant around 4:00 PM and was seated within five minutes. About ten minutes later, another party was seated next to mine. Their server took their order before mine, who didn't come for another ten minutes. I also had to ask for utensils and bread, which should be commonplace among all of these restaurants.

Once we did get our water we were able to order our food.  Food & Service  We started off with the Buffalo Blasts since I've had them from the Cheesecake Factory back in NY and they were phenomenal! The ones I got here were burnt to a crisp and I felt like I was eating something made in a rush. There were some pieces that were good but most of them were on the burnt end of the spectrum. We also had gotten a wrong order of food brought to us but atleast they were able to bring out the right dish really quick due to the hiccup. The grilled salmon I got was good but I wouldn't say it was amazing compared to other places that I've been. My main complaint was that the service at this place was EXTREMELY slow for a day where only a few tables were taken so I was really disappointed with that. - 1 star for the burnt Buffalo Blasts and another - 1 for the very slow service.

The actual restaurant is nice and well maintained. I was happy we were seated on the outside patio as the weather that day was perfect. We tried a few different appetizers that were all to die for: the crispy fried cheese, the avocado eggrolls and the fried zucchini. The mains were a different story. I had Evelyn's pasta, although it was good, it didn't justify the price tag. Others in our group had the salmon, fish tacos, grilled cheese, fried chicken strips and a veggie burger. No one was wowed with their food, all of the people who ordered fried dishes commented that the food was oily making me think their oil wasn't hot enough. I tried my son's chicken tenders and they were bland along with having absorbed way too much of the frying oil.  Service on the other hand was outstanding.

So I was amazed from hearing about that so I decided to go after work, and gave it a stop by on my way home. But what I did was I called to order a sliced of the "" raspberry white chocolate truffles "" when I was about 3-4 mins away from the location. As soon as I got there they charged me immediately, and hand it to me even though it was extremely packed inside.  -The location is in dolphin mall, and regarding parking you have more than enough spots to station your car including a parking garage.  -Another thing is that amazed me was hearing from one of the employees that this is their 9th year doing this event.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2

Honestly, the food was great, and the restaurant was not very busy we went around 6:30pm. Our server took 30 minutes to bring out our cheesecake and then about another 15 minutes to bring us our check.

We were seated outside as asked with 40 minutes of our arrival, when we were seated we noticed a table of like 20 pre teens being loud and disruptive, now I have nothing bad to say about loudness because I'm pretty loud but they were over the top and no one told them anything this is supposed to be a romantic restaurant and to me that's unacceptable shame on the manager!  We ordered the crab wontons, and I must say the filling is delicious it is well cooked soft and has plenty of crab but the outside was extremely burnt. Then the pasta my husband and I both ordered pastas and when they came to the table they looked more like soup, this restaurant is known for big portions and I have to say the plate was huge but it was all sauce followed by a spoonful of pasta and a couple of pieces of chicken.  The only good part of the dinner was the cheesecake, which unfortunately had the macadamia nuts frozen!!!  At least I enjoyed it once I took off the nuts. On a good note out waiter tony was very nice and made sure we had plenty of bread and that are drinks were always full. Thank you tony!!!

However, I waited 15 minutes to be greeted once I sat down, it was as if I wasn't there. This place was not busy... AT ALL. By the time my waiter came i was ready for my full order. They had just opened so I expected some fresh warm bread my favorite at any Cheesecake Factory. The bread was stale and cold. I asked for a water no ice with lemon instead I was given a glass of water that was appropriate for some tea boiling. Took another 30 minutes... 30 whole minutes for my food to arrive. This literally made my blood boil, I had just ordered a plain seared tuna salad. How they managed to make this take so long I will never understand this isn't even a cooked menu item. When i finally got my salad after my waiter, who was quite nice, apologized for the delay I couldn't wait to dig in. Until I realize that the tuna was old. I just ate the greens and left the tuna untouched. I pointed this out to my waiter who ten proceeded with a crapy excuse. Seriously the worst Cheesecake Factory I've stepped foot on.

The mojito on the other hand is very refreshing and should of ordered that instead. Moving to the food, I ordered the chicken lemon herb. I did not read the discription and this was a quater chicken and i was expection a chicken breast, but not to worry because the dish did not disappoint at alllll!  The perfect seasoning to the chicken of lemon and herb was magnificent!  The chicken was not dry, the mash potatoes were a bit cool but the vegtables were very good.

It was that good!   First the entree , this once was a monster of a meal. There was enough for two meals and drenched in thick awesome gravy.  This time around, the size was pared down but all the classic ingredients were still present, the pan fried crusted chicken breast, the house made biscuit, fluffy mashed potatoes and tastes carrots, peas and mushrooms lightly covered in a thinner less creamy gravy. I am sure my waistline appreciates the smaller portions and so does my taste buds. They were screaming for mercy  later after the decedent short cake. A tower of sweet candies strawberries atop creamy vanilla ice cream placed between a huge fluffy biscuit and topped with a pyramid of whipped cream that a pharaoh would envy. Who should think that a dessert this great would rival the namesake of this establishment? and the proverbial icing on the cake . My sweet Bobby, she was such a joy. My coworkers salad was not as ordered and she didn't even let the plate touch the table before she took it and replaced it with the correct item.

I was thinking ""Ok... we will be waiting for a good 40 minutes or more."" and... .Oh was I proven wrong!

When she read the ingredients and saw that the chicken was glazed with soy she became skeptical. I told her to give it a try. That if it tasted bad to blame it on me (as if that would fix the problem if it truly tasted bad right?). Anyway, she was really pleased with her selection and the chicken was actually very flavorful, tender, and juicy. HEY J.C.! - JUICY MOUTHED!

Neal R.,"Miami, United States",19,23,133,4.0,24/3/2015,"Funny that while I compared the restaurant I went to yesterday to Cheesecake Factory, I happened to come here the very next day! I've always loved eating at The Cheesecake Factory...well, almost always. You'll love eating here; that is, if you can bypass paying a few dollars more for dishes including those you can find at other restaurants. It was an early Monday evening, but my family, friend and I got a table in seconds. Expect most of the tables to be taken when you come in the evening. Huge parties of people would come here for birthdays. Our party sat at a four-person table while I took an extra chair. The restaurant interior is one of the most intricate and distinctive restaurant interiors I've ever seen - so classy and top-notch. I also like the Picasso-style art over the kitchen. The Cheesecake Factory has the widest variety of food I've ever seen in a menu: burgers and sandwiches, pasta, tacos, chicken, steak, seafood, salads, as well as reduced-calorie SkinnyLicious options. I like that most of their dishes are unique - maybe that explains why their menus are so big, and that people come here so often. It's unlikely that you'll find these dishes anywhere else. Dad had the Avocado Eggrolls. My brother had pasta. Mom and our friend Francesse had the Sheila's Chicken and Avocado Salad. I had the Baja Chicken Tacos with rice and black beans. All the food has been artfully and well-prepared, and it all tasted great. However, I don't understand why the portions are huge! We talked amongst ourselves, saying that while the portions are huge, they have gotten only slightly smaller from the last few times we've been at the Factory. For dessert, we, of course, shared a slice of cheesecake - the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Again, unique and delicious. The waiters are studious in their jobs. They are to be commended for being focused at all times, accurately following instructions, and being courteous of the customers: as I was sitting in the extra chair, the waiter forgot to get me an extra fork, knife, napkin, etc. When I brought it up with him, he apologized. I needed cutlery and a napkin, so I vaguely asked another waiter to bring me a ""fork and knife"", but that's exactly what he brought me, so I also asked for a napkin. Our party didn't want refills, but the good thing is our waiter asked if we wanted any. The Cheesecake Factory is one of the best places to eat at in groups - maybe celebrate your next birthday here? That way, you all can share the dining experience together. To save money, I recommend only coming here once in a while. Expect to spend about $20 to $30 per person, which includes an entrée, drink, then consider an appetizer/dessert. It's well worth your money, though. It's one of the best restaurant franchises I will ever eat at.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=80

Iris C.,"Miami, United States",203,49,288,2.0,22/1/2014,"Came here twice, and you would think it would be like any other cheesecake factory experience, but it's not. First of all, the service here is super slow, I understand that the restaurant is located at Dolphin mall which has more foot traffic when compared to Dadeland, but still the service and quality shouldn't change.  The first time I came here, we ordered the tomato basil pasta, and the pasta was under cooked. The waitress tried to play it off stating that it was ""al dente"" but it was far from being ""al dente"" so the waitress took it back to the chef, and they supposedly made us a new plate. Unfortunately, when the plate came out, it literally looked as if they dumped our plate of pasta into boiling water and just pour sauce over it again.  On the other hand, the ahi carpaccio was delicious, the fish was fresh, and I would definitely recommend this dish.  The second time here, we ordered the buffalo wings, and the fried calamari. The fried calamari was delicious, and it was very light and not heavily battered. Before we ordered the wings, we asked our waitress how many wings the plate comes with, and we were told 10 wings. When the dish came out, it was 8 wings and half were burnt. . We asked the waitress if she could exchange the burnt ones, she told my boyfriend to eat one, and she took the rest back. When it came back out, it was only 5 wings on the plate. We confronted our waitress, and she immediately asked, how many wings we have already eaten, and even checked under our plates. She then took it back it back to the kitchen again, and when it was brought back out she said that they weigh the wings by 10 ounces...after she already said it was 10 pieces of wings...so we paid $11.50 for basically 6 little wings. To replace the 4 missing wings from the order, our waitress brought out fries. meh.

Maple P.,"Miami, United States",0,21,47,4.0,10/10/2015,"One can never resist the desserts at The Cheesecake Factory. Try one and you will never regret the calories that were gained. Came with a party of 8. The hostess said the wait would be an hour long and gave us one of the beepers. It toke exactly one hour for us to get seated. Got here at 6:05pm and got seated at 7:05pm. Our waiter was a very sociable and energetic person. He immediately toke our drinks. I got strawberry lemonade. It was $4.95, the glass holding the lemonade has cystal sugar along the top lining. When ordering the entrées, the waiter would make a positive side comment on how the food choice we were making was excellent. Got annoying after he got the 5th order out of the 8. The waiter gave us 1 basket of bread with butter on a side plate. The bread basket comes with 2 mini loaf of wheat bread and 1 mini loaf of white bread. The white bread's crust was too hard, not burnt hard, but the hard that results when the time between baking the bread and eating it is long. On the other hand, the wheat bread was crispy, I could easy cut into this bread, and the inside was still warm and chewy. We got our food around 7:45 so it was like a 35 minute wait from ordering to receiving food. I got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Note: the lighting is weird inside the restaurant. The lights give off as a shade of orange so everything in the restaurant looks like it's a shade of orange. When I got my pasta entrée I could not tell if I had gotten chicken or shrimp as the meat because the lighting made my entire dish orange colored, but once I tasted it, I could tell that it was chicken. Also, when it says SPICY Chicken Chipotle Pasta, it literally means spicy. I love spicy food no matter how extreme the spiciness is, but as a warning, don't get this platter if you do not like extremely spicy food (from 1 to 10, this is a level 9 spiciness). The waiter was around every now and then to make sure everything was good. When it came to getting boxes for our leftovers, we 1st asked for 3 boxes, but then realized we needed more. Gladly, the waiter didn't seem to mind making 2 more trips for boxes and bags.

Don't let the outside crowd fool you, you will be seated right away. I know the menu inside and out so I was ready to order but nah the server decides to grab my drinks first.  I was fine with this. The problem begins after you place your order. Prepare to play the game of ""Where is Waldo?"" with your server. Mind you, there's a stampede of servers running around this place so it's a mind boggling experience.  10 minutes after placing the order, the bread comes, server leaves but the drink he brought me 20 minutes ago needed a refill.  Where is Waldo? I found Waldo but he's at the other end taking another table's order. I wave him over and he pretends like he doesn't have peripheral vision. I am watching ice melt at this point and a puddle forming from the condensation. Where is Waldo? 10 minutes later, the appetizer comes but it's colder than my ex gf. Not to mention, Waldo never brought me utensils.  Where is Waldo? Waldo comes back with the entree but I didn't get to address the appetizer issue because Waldo leaves again. Where is Waldo? So I'm there sitting with my date without utensils, cold apps, and literally cotton mouth. Waldo reappears and asks me how the food is so far? I address the issue and he finds the audacity to ask me not to tell the manager about what happened.

The menu is like a book, too big, when there are so many dishes I wonder if really all of them can be made with good quality.  Service was friendly and attentive and I liked the atmosphere inside, lighting music etc at the right level. But, the reason I give 3 stars instead of 4 is simple, even if the food is good, the price is too high for what it is. My shrimp pasta did not have enough shrimps in it to justify the 19 dollars. Also I expected more flavor.  You would think a chain restaurant would be cheaper, but it's not.

Sanita M.,"Tampa, United States",126,383,2143,3.0,27/7/2015,"I have always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory - great food (dinner and cakes) but I came in for breakfast and this was one of my least favorite meals. We stayed at the hotel right next to the mall, and usually we do have breakfast at the hotel were I enjoy potatoes and scrambled eggs. This time we decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory. I never had breakfast here before but I absolutely love their dinner dishes like salads, tamale, etc., and of course the cakes. Anyways, in my opinion this is not a good place for breakfast. First, breakfast items on the menu are pretty expensive, the portions are small and the quality (plus, the wait!) is not worth the money. Breakfast cost about $12 and it had 2 eggs (scrambled, my choice), 3 slices of tomatoes and brick hard, over fried potatoes, that were very oily. I love potatoes, I even order mash potatoes on the side, but I think these were the worst potatoes. Not only they were oily, they were almost burned, so hard I could not stick a fork in them. When I asked the waitress why potatoes are so hard and tiny, she said ""That's the way they are here!"" Hmmm.. ok, good to know. As for my husbands dish, he ordered Eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon and it came out with oily (I guess it's American style) bacon with almost no meat, just fat. She did apologize though and bought out the right bacon on a side. So I'm giving two stars for my visit here because I liked my scrambled eggs. We also ordered a cake to go. Have to admit, that Oreo Cheesecake was way, way too sweet, so no extra star here. P.S. I think that Cheesecake Factory should learn how to cook breakfast potatoes. I prefer Denny's potatoes that are crispy from outside and soft from inside. I can actually chew them without breaking my tooth.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=40

We've tried their burgers, pastas, quesadillas, shepherds pie and several appetizers. One of my fav dishes from here  is the Parmesan crusted chicken Romano.

I pretty much like everything I've had at Cheesecake, again, Fat = Flavor.  This review is a reflection of my last visit this past weekend, in which I had the worst items I've experience in 15+ years at dining at Cheesecake.  --- The Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls were the worse I've ever had. They were pre-rolled and sitting out for a loooong time, because those rice wrappers were hard as a rock. Each roll had 1/2 a shrimp!!!  --- The Eggroll Sampler... oily as expected, but there's a right way to fry food that won't taste overly oily. Not complaining about the oiliness, but the Firecracker Salmon in the sampler was extremely disappointing. Salmon in only 1/3 of the eggroll, and definitely not as advertised on the website.  I felt like I was robbed on both these items, not worth the price & definitely never ordering these again! 1 star for the service, better than most time.

It was my birthday Brunch. We got seated at the ending of the outdoor patio next to OTHER people eating when there was multiple empty seating in between. The waitress asked us mid way through leaving through the door ""do you want bread?"" I wish she would of just brought it instead of asking the way she did so casually. We were brought sourdough and another type of bread. It was so stale it could break a tooth, and oh boy did it. Mid chew... I realized that a tooth I had a root canal on had completely chipped off. That's how freaking hard that bread was. Super disappointed. We ordered Evelyn's Favorite Lunch Pasta and a Chipotle Pasta from the Lunch special as well. For some reason my Evelyn's pasta was nowhere near evenly coated. The noodles looked dried, and the sauce to one side. And it was extremely room temperature. Yet the Chipotle Pasta was super HOT. So obviously mine was left out to wait for his pasta to come out. I believe if I remember correctly... The waitress only asked us once if we were okay.

We spent about 30 minutes trying to find parking. When we finally got to the restaurant we were lucky enough to be seated quickly because there were two of us and we were willing to sit outside. Luckily it wasn't too hot. The waiter was kind but because there are so many items on the menu (over 250!) or maybe they were new, it took us a while to order. I also love that they now have the calorie information for every item. This is something we took into consideration as well when making our choices. Our food took a reasonable amount of time and I am very appreciative that they were able to remove mushrooms from my pasta as I cannot eat them.

This is a relatively new location at the Dolphin Mall taking over the former Borders Bookstore space. As with most Cheescake Factories, the place is huge.  The menu is huge.  The portions are huge.  The crowds are huge.  The calorie counts are huge too!

Donald P.,"Columbia, United States",1,44,18,4.0,2/12/2015,I am not a fan of the Cheesecake Facory and came here as part of a group. I was very plenantly surprised. The beef medallions were delecious and served piping hot. The mashed potatoes and veggies were great as well. The waiter allowed us to each have individual checks even though there was 12 of us. The cheesecake desert did not disappoint.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=140
Kelly L.,"Miami, United States",0,26,10,1.0,6/5/2013,"Dolphin mall is a great place to shop and the Cheesecake Factory could have not chosen a better location.  However, this location is much smaller and the wait time is longer. Even the bathrooms are less unique. There's only 3 stalls and there was a line waiting to wash hands. The good was not the best I've tasted from the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered my usual which was the bistro shrimp pasta and the taste was awful. There was no zesty flavor and not enough cream. My nieces order the four cheese pasta and it looked like pasta mixed with a can of tomato sauce. My second ordered the chicken Romano and the chicken tastes like it was boiled with bread crumbs on top.  The good thing about this place was that our server was nice and very attentive. I think I will stick with Dadeland Cheesecake Factory until this location gets there food straighten out.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=140

Natalie A.,"Miami, United States",0,15,,3.0,2/8/2015,"I usually have wonderful experiences at The Cheesecake Factory, but I had never been to the one at Dolphin and it was a very underwhelming experience, unfortunately. First off, too many tourists. They walk in with the enormous suitcases that they just purchased at the mall and take up all the room in the tiny lobby of the restaurant. The doors are opened so frequently that the lobby is more of a sauna; full of hot air and it feels disgusting. Plus, the constant wind from the door opening does nothing good for your hair. Don't ever wait for your table in there; it's better to wait outside. Second: Dirty, dirty, dirty. I joked with my boyfriend that the restaurant was so dimly lit because they wanted to try to cover up how dirty everything actually is, and I probably wasn't too far off. The floor by our table was disgusting; crumbs and God knows what else all over the place, and my boyfriend said his side of the floor felt wet. Two bussers came to clean up the table next to us after the family had left and did what can only be called a mediocre job. My boyfriend used to be a busser, and he was shaking his head the whole time as he watched in horror how they ""cleaned"" the table. What looked like a dirty cloth was carelessly swiped across the table a few times, and then the CLEAN utensils were placed directly onto the table (with no napkin or plate beneath them) by the bare hands of the second busser, who was grabbing the utensils by the part you put your food on. Gross. My boyfriend said that bussers probably have the dirtiest hands next to the dishwashers (because they are the ones that pick up the dirty plates and cups when everyone leaves), and these were the guys touching the clean utensils people were about to eat with. Why not wrap up the utensils in napkins like every other restaurant? Needless to say I was a little disgusted.  Granted, we went on a Saturday night to Dolphin Mall (always a mistake because of parking, crowds, and wait times) so service was not the best. I told the waitress to give me max five minutes to decide on what I wanted to order, and she avoided our table for the next fifteen minutes. She was kind, always made sure we had water, and brought me extra cheese for my pasta immediately. But, she took a long time in coming around to take our orders and it was hard to get her attention to come to our table. I can only complain about one aspect of the food; the complimentary bread that they brought was stale. We were given one of each bread, and the white one was hard as a rock. You could tell it wasn't made fresh, that loaf had been sitting somewhere for hours and that's what they brought us. The other loaf was warm and soft; that's how you know.  Our meals were delicious because you can't go wrong with anything at the Cheesecake Factory. The plates are enormous and you will definitely leave in a food coma. The cheesecakes are delicious and big enough to split between two people (although my boyfriend claimed he could have finished the mango key lime cheesecake all by himself). I have no complaints about our food, it was great, but the overall experience was not what I had anticipated from this restaurant. I think it's just the location and the fact that it was a Saturday night, but the mediocre cleaning done by bussers is something to worry about. I'll stick to the Dadeland location for future outings.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=140

Keith P.,"Washington, DC, United States",563,629,328,4.0,12/12/2012,"THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! YES!!!! Known for their classy, delicious, and trendy desserts! ................................ Before I continue with this review, I would just like to say that it is very difficult to review chain restaurants because they are the same. They are all run the same, have the same setup/décor, and most importantly serve the same food. And that is the truth at all of Cheesecake Factories +100 locations. However, since I would like to offer as much information as possible, I would like to compare this Cheesecake Factory to the other popular Cheesecake Factory in South Florida--- the one at Dadeland Mall. (Note: there is also one in Coconut Grove.) _______________________ DADELAND CHEESECAKE VS. DOLPHIN MALL CHEESECAKE: Which one stacks up better? Which one is better? Where should you go? Location: Dadeland is the mall for the classy and those who want to spend money. Dolphin Mall is the home for those who like to shop on a budget--they do have outlet stores after all. Also, since the mall is bigger it has more parking for its cheesecake enthusiasts, so ONE POINT easily goes to DOLPHIN MALL CHEESECAKE. Service: When I went to Dolphin Mall Cheesecake, they were really slow. I am not sure if it was because they just got trained or were nervous, but our food was slow to come out. I think someone may have made a mistake in the kitchen. But my water glass was always full because once I took a sip, the waitress was back to fill my cup. At Dadeland Cheesecake, service is relatively fast, but they have messed up my food order a couple of times which made them take longer. TIE IN THIS CATEGORY! Food: Same food, love their cheesecakes. My favorite dish is the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Superb taste of coconut! The Skinnylicious menu is offered at both locations for those on a diet. TIE AGAIN! Space: It is rumored that the Cheesecake Factory at Dadeland is expanding. But even without the rumored expansion, the one at Dadeland definitely has more space. The Cheesecake Factory at Dolphin has more outside space, but the seating in the inside just doesn't match up to the one at Dadeland. ONE POINT goes to DADELAND CHEESECAKE. AND WHAT DO WE HAVE?! A TIE!!!! In conclusion, I would say both of these Cheesecake Factories have their pros and cons. Both have good food. If you are looking to shop for a day, go to the one at Dolphin Mall to take advantage of their prices. If you want a faster reservation due to amount of space, go to Dadeland. Space at this Cheesecake Factory may be especially limited because the mall gets really busy at night, but overall, I like how this chain is expanding because I do love my Cheesecake! I would definitely come here again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami-2?start=100

Abby D.,"Miami, United States",219,11,,2.0,20/5/2016,"I am giving this place two stars not because the food and drinks were bad, but because the service was not good. I came here with my coworkers for our monthly happy hour, and when we entered we were immediately seated in the dining area without even being given the choice. When we spoke to the manager (Freddy) in regards to charging us happy hour prices in the dinning area he said no; understandable, but the way he came across was not pleasing. Once in the bar area, we got our drinks, appetizers, and food, but felt a lack of attention from our waitress. Our waters were not refilled and we had to ask multiple times for the status on our drinks and food. Once the bill came, we had to send them back because all happy hour specials were priced at regular price. In addition, a coworker of mine ordered a virgin mojito and was priced the same amount for an alcoholic one! When we brought this up to our waitress' attention she stated that the manager was not going to give her a discounted price. She received a discount on the drink ONLY when I asked for his name. In conclusion, we will not be coming back to this location for happy hour. You should not have to beg for good service to be given.

We got the best table where you can comfortably fit six people!! The service was friendly and efficient and the general ambience was pretty   mom ordered the harvest salad its lean and healthy (if you take out the dressing) which is what my mom did, my cousin ordered the Mexican salad from the skinnylicious menu which let me tell you IT IS HUUUUGE but really satisfying, and I ordered the Tuscan chicken without the farro and I really like it, it is not so big but once again very satisfying. Overall it's a good restaurant for a family meal. We loved the brown bread it is just sooo good so we ordered to take the rest home and they gave us more for free! Once we were finished with the food we were debating whether or not to ordered a dessert but sorry not this time, it's just way too much sugar and fat in once single slice.

Jamie C.,"Miami, United States",5,41,1,4.0,4/7/2015,"So I went as part of a group and keep in mind this is a chain. This review is based on this restaurant. They had a few quality control issues - some corn in my spinach, and one order was lost. I ordered a steak medium rare but it was well done, although not bad. The grilled broccoli was almost raw. It was a holiday and they were rushed and dos accommodate a large party and I am sure on other occasions they will do better. It's just ok as far as cheesecake factories go, and it's decent but not great. The server was very nice and attentive. For the price it's probably worth the money. The main course food was hot and cooked to order ; but the appetizers were not (nachos) and looked like they had been under a heat lamp. The salad looked fresh.

Than I ordered the shrimp Blt the shrimp were not cleaned at all, and we had some sort or stick object that we couldn't make out what it was. I informed the server and showed him what we found and he looked baffled did not know what is was either.

It was so refreshing and toppings and textures were perfect! With lettuce, pico de gallo, beans, tortilla strips, chicken and a yummy sauce you cant go wrong!
