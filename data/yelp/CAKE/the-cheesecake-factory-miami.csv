Roger V.,"Miami, FL",278,1,1,1.0,8/20/2017,"I usually don't call people out for poor service and even worse customer service especially with what is going on in society now a days, people have bigger fish to fry! I am honestly blown away at the total lack of any customer service @cheesecakefactory today! I was in the biz for many years and understand that mistakes are made and people have bad days. I was on hold for 17 minutes to place a pick up order. I actually arrived at the restaurant while still on hold when the manager picked up and I was standing next to her. At this point the manager did not offer any type of apology. She took my order and arrived about 20 minutes later for takeout. No apologies from the manager or the staff. No sense of urgency or customer service. I did not expect a free meal but did expect some kind of customer service from not the only the manager but the staff. It's simply ridiculous where customer service is now a days. I still know people that work at this location and nothing against them, but it's extremely poor management period! #thecheesecakefactory #poorservice #nocaring #lackofcommunication #totaldisappointment",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80
Harold C.,"Homestead, FL",26,2,6,3.0,6/8/2017,"I love this place when it comes to cheesecake but the food is not so great . The service is good during weekdays but for some reason not so great on the weekends , maybe because they are busier on the weekends",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80
Karen V.,"Miami, FL",0,8,,1.0,5/27/2017,THIS DESERVES LOWER THAN ONE STAR BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT ISN'T AN OPTION! The service is horrible! The food is mediocre! The waiter was missing half of our food and it took two hours to receive our food!! Not only that but it took so long for our food to come that we barely had time to eat because the valet was already closing!! I will never be eating at this location again! How disappointing!!!! They hadn't even started on the fish tacos so we canceled or order. And my husband had to eat off of my plate !!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80
Michael A.,"Miami, FL",35,8,3,1.0,2/25/2017,"I came to this location with my wife because we had a 25 dollar gift card and we have generally had good experiences with each visit. The food and service has always been good. The location at Dadeland was a horrible experience and my wife and I don't care to ever go back to a Cheesecake Factory. It took about 20 minutes for the waiter to even notice that we were sat down, after which we were already frustrated seeing people being sat and immediately helped. Then the manager asked us if we would move because he needed the table for a larger group. Once the food arrived (hibachi steak), which took a while, the meat was burned on the outside and the vegetables were still raw. I've had the dish before and it was nothing like how it was before. Overall it was a frustrating experience and mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80
Nasha W.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",45,453,281,4.0,12/26/2014,"Cheesecake factory  offers consistent quality of meals each time we go :-) this particular  location is very crowded and busy so goodluck squeezing I  through the door and finding the line to check in.  My go-to plate is the thai  lettuce wraps. They are absolutely delicious and do not make you feel terribly full afterward. Try your wraps with the peanut sauce, yum! On this particular visit our waiter was very helpful. Although he seemed very busy he still tried his best to help us with what we needed and with a positive disposition.  I recommend  eating here on a weekday at earlier hours otherwise prepare to be pushed and shoved out of the way by fellow patrons. They have got to figure out how to make the check in process more efficient because right now it's a mess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80
Alexa S.,"Washington, DC",0,5,,1.0,5/26/2017,"I ordered the ALMOND-CRUSTED SALMON SALAD. Here is how its described on the menu: Pan Seared and Served Over Kale, Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Arugula, Avocado, Quinoa, Cranberries and Radishes. Tossed with Our Vinaigrette. Here is what I got- it was more like salmon lightly sprinkled in almonds with a bed of kale. I couldn't even find the brussels sprouts and there was absolutely no arugula. The avocado equated to about 5 bites, there were 4 slices of radish, about 5 cranberries, and a spoonful of quinoa. Considering the description, I expected more than kale and salmon with a few garnishes. I would have complained had I been in the restaurant, but I ordered it to be delivered though another vendor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80
Juliete R.,"Miami, FL",1,11,,1.0,5/23/2017,"Aside from this location, I've also attended the Dolphin Mall and Coral Gables Cheesecake Factory. I assumed this restaurant was going to be exquisite because of all the competing food spots around. I ordered a chicken alfredo pasta which only came with six small squares of chicken. I also ordered a frozen strawberry daiquiri which had a small shot in it, you can HARDLY taste the alcohol; only all the way at the bottom of the drink. Definitely won't be coming back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80
Allison M.,"Miami, FL",0,12,3,1.0,8/5/2017,"where to begin... my family and I have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for as long as I can remember. I've been to many locations around the U.S and never have had such a disappointing experience here at the Cheesecake Factory In miami, dadeland mall. First I want to say the hostess don't know what they are doing. They completely over quoted me when it wasn't even that busy and had my family and I wait over an hour and a half for a party of five adults. We finally got sat at a table which the floor around it and under it and the sliverware were completely disgusting and filthy. When our waitress arrived, we told her about the sliverware and he didn't say anything just grabbed it all and left. She came back with another set of sliverware and took our drink order. She was then gone for about 15mins while we were waiting. She came back and took our order for appetizers and we also were ready to order our main courses aswell. We ordered Nachos with chicken, Avocado egg rolls and the sweet corn tamale cakes, it took 25 mins till it finally hit the table. Our main courses hit the table 10 mins after we got our appetizers. The server didn't let us know and communicate what was even going on throughout the waiting process. On top of that all our main courses were cold. The steak my sister ordered was suppose to be medium rare and it was well done. She had to wait an extra almost 20 mins for another steak to be prepared. The manager Linda wasn't helpful at all so we asked for another manager because she had such attitude. Dora stopped by the table and was completely careless and said sorry, offered a cheesecake at the end but it was never granted to us. The servers in the restaurant just hangout around the computers talking and on their phones and neglecting guest around them including our server. My family and I couldn't be more disappointed. We ended up paying full price for everything when it all was a complete disaster. This place will go down hill just like coconut grove did. The most disappointing thing was the service. Our server Pearl didn't not care about our experience nor her job. Never coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80
Ivonne F.,"Hialeah, FL",28,8,,1.0,5/21/2017,"Our waitress Carla was very nice, food tasted good except my husbands side alfredo pasta, it was just boiled fetuccini no oil, butter,salt NOTHING!

Vee W.,"Laveen Village, AZ",12,48,34,4.0,3/24/2017,I love The Cheesecake Factory. We are staying at the Marriott across the street from here so we decided to eat here. Service was great and the food was wonderful as always. Only thing I would say is that this place gets really packed so be prepared to wait a bit especially on the weekend. One downfall though was the size of the pieces of cheesecake. They have gotten really small for the price but I guess that the way it goes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80
Mickey C.,"Miami, FL",0,30,11,1.0,9/15/2017,"I have been to most Cheesecake Factories in Miami in one time or another. The waiters and the food is pretty much almost the same at all locations. Unfortunately this review is about their front of house staff. I cant say anything good about them because they will have you waiting for 15 minutes for a table for two people on a non busy day when there is plenty of tables available. Next, we wanted to sit on a booth for two and instead, the lady sat us next to a loud family of six. Where we were so crammed up in a corner that their shopping bags were crushing me. Completely unfair. Then our waitress comes after 10 minutes of us sitting there and ask her if we could move to the booth for two people right in front of us that was available and she says ""idk you have to go to the front and talk to them."" What kind of response is this? This is YOUR JOB, you go talk to your coworker, I PAY YOU. YOU WORK FOR ME. This is part of being a server. I decided fine, I go up to the front and the lady acts confused and decides that she doesnt want to understand that I want to sit at another table. Then makes me wait all over again when I already waited and then talks to other people. We walked out of this restaurant. No service. No real food. Disgrace. Do not come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80
Taina T.,"Miami, FL",58,4,1,3.0,4/26/2017,The food at this location was all right. I ordered the chicken Madera and I was completely unimpressed I'm not sure if you guys change the recipe for the sauce but it was definitely not what I expected. I ordered a bloody Mary from the bar extra spicy and was given a regular bloody Mary I ordered a second one extra spicy and was given a regular Bloody Mary. All and all drinks were ok food was ok.

Monica F.,"Miami, FL",0,9,11,5.0,4/15/2017,"The good was absolutely delicious. Our waitress was extremely sweet, smile on her face the whole time and super attentive. I wish I remembered her name. Entrees were the four cheese pasta with chicken, really yummy. Hubby had the salmon with mash potatoes and asparagus. He usually has salmon when we got to a restaurant and he said this salmon had been the best he ever had. The dessert was also delicious I asked the waitress to recommend which one of the chocolate selections was the best and she recommended the Hersheys one it really was wonderful we also tried the Natala one which was also very good. We haven't been to the cheesecake factory in a long time and it was our first time visiting the dolphin mall location we will definitely go back again and we hope to get the same waitress we had this time she was excellent",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80

MickeyBlue I.,"Hollywood, FL",225,672,3129,4.0,8/4/2015,"I started off hating this Cheesecake Factory  based on the horrible parking and the insane amount of people there. It's like nobody works! Surprisingly our wait time was only 10 minutes for a booth and we were greeted promptly by an EXCELLENT server named Colleen.      The restaurant itself is VERY noisy and crowded, undisciplined kids running all over the place and selfish parents that think it's cute. However we noticed that it does die down after 3PM (mental note) Colleen our server was very friendly and wore a genuine smile throughout our lunch.      Their was a slight hiccup with our order, but the manager was kind enough to inform us on the mistake and made every effort to accommodate us while we waited. Even with the slight delay in our food I have to say I really enjoyed it here, mostly due to our great server and the funny Manager who made our experience a pleasant one.      The Cheesecake Factory has always been a consistent place to eat with reasonable prices and generous portions. My Chicken Carbonara was excellent! And their Chicken Picatta is wonderful! Make sure you take advantage of the lunch portions served until 5PM, unless you have a big appetite then go for the dinner portion.      As usual I cannot leave without dessert so being the wild, crazy and spontaneous guy that I am I ordered the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake! Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=80

But our waitress Jessica  (who is  ) suggested a Mai Tai  and I still wasn't please but made the best of it. Now my appetizer  the crab dip was delicious. I ordered the Jamaican pepper shrimp and it came out cold, so I returned it. I then ordered the NY strip and that was delicious. Overall the food was ok.

Jose M.,"Miami, FL",12,102,16,1.0,12/21/2015,"This restaurant has been on my goto list for many years because of quality food served consistently, but all good things must come to an end. Slowly food quality and presentation have declined. Visited yesterday and crowds are still there, but not as bad as expected. They still have the fastest table turn over rate and was seated promptly. The food was mediocre to average. Ordered the onion rings which I've never had and will never again. They  came in a horrible batter badly fried and greasy. They didn't come with any dipping sauce to redeem them. Ordered my favorite Chicken Madeira which never disappoints, but today it was awful. Came with a red sauce which I have never seen. Like it was suppose to be something else and they ""fixed"" it.   The Shrimp Scampi Bistro was Average, although the shrimp quality is not there anymore.  Skipped dessert which still looks good.  During the long wait for my meal which would usually automatically trigger a manager visit, I noticed a little fruit fly hanging out. I thought it was odd, but that just might be a reflection of the restaurants cleanliness.  This place went from ""oh boy going to Cheesecake"" to another chain restaurant that is losing its way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=140

After 20 minutes I was immediately seated and greeted by my waiter Jason. Jason was very kind, pleasant, and very attentive! My daughter wanted shrimp as an entrée so I got her the dynamite shrimp, I never knew that Cheesecake Factory had a kids menu until last night (which has a variety of items to choose from) except for shrimp, which was ok. I had The Tex Mex eggrolls, which came with the salsa and sauce, it was so fresh and crispy that it tasted as if Jason had deep fried the eggrolls right in front of me! I also had the chicken Madeira, steak Dianne and mash potatoes, it was good as expected no complaints other than I wished it came with more four pieces of steak. As you can see I didn't have room for dessert, but the cheesecakes are a ""must have"".

I think the thai chicken lettuce wraps were delicious and would recommend. The spring roll was very bland and just a wrapped salad.  I ordered the salmon which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The portion size wasn't that big compared to the rest of the menu which was great for me.  I wish they would have asked me how I like my salmon since it was very dry. Others at the table ordered steak, veggie burger, regular Kobe burger, etc. None of the meals stuck out besides the portion size.  Our table couldn't decide on dessert so we ordered a few different ones to share amongst the group. We had the Kailua and coffee  cheesecake, ice cream sundae, and chocolate cake. The cake was very rich and a bite or two is all you need. The cheesecake was the perfect combo and  lighter.  This place is very crowd and doesn't take reservations.

I went on a Monday night and although it was packed I was able to find parking at the front of the mall where cheesecake factory is located.  When you walk in you are greeted automatically by the host . The atmosphere is vivacious but also romantic since they tend to dim the lights at night .  My server seemed very busy from the start and rushed . I understand it's a fast paced industry but you must always give undivided attention . Aside from that , his service was great ! For an appetizer , I had amazing crab wontons and they bring a good portion definitely enough for two people. As my main entrée I ordered the veggie burger ... it was DELICIOUS .

We asked our waiter to get the manager and before he walked away , he said they had several people call in sick and the kitchen is really backed up. The manager came over and did not apologize about the wait. He said it is taking 25 minutes to get food  out of the kitchen.

Gerald Z.,"Miami, FL",140,1,4,5.0,8/21/2016,I had dinner here a few times. 2 out of those times we were served by Anthony Lafontaine. This waiter is what has made our experience here significant. He goes beyond and above to make us feel special. He made great recommendations. The water never reaches the bottom of the cup nor does the lemonade.

This Cheesecake Factory has potential, but the service here is absolutely awful. I can't even count how many times this place has let me down.  This past Sunday, I went with a group of friends. The hostess and one of the servers seemed to be feuding in front of us. What we received in terms of a welcome was far from warm. Speaking of warm, our food wasn't - everything was cold.... And speaking of cold... Our server's personality was cold, and about as stale as the potatoes that came with my breakfast. We didn't catch a single smile from him, nor did her even make an attempt to seem engaging. At a certain point (about 5 minutes in) we started feeling like he was annoyed with having to serve us.

Abisai H.,"Miami, FL",670,166,692,3.0,7/19/2014,"This location is a hit or miss. You can either have the best experience or the worst.  The waiters are very knowledgable and they can all speak greatly about the menu and will recommend you very good plates depending on your cravings.  One of the best things at cheesecake is the complimentary bread they bring you, but at this location, most of the time it comes stale or old. This is definitely someone they need to work and improve on.  I will say tho, they have one of the best caipirinha in town. Be sure to ask for extra lemon because it will heighten the taste and you won't feel the strong liquor as much.  It is after all cheesecake and the verity is excellent! Be sure to leave some room for any of the flavors, but I can never get anything else than the Oreo cheesecake!

Donna D.,"Melbourne, Australia",206,302,395,3.0,10/16/2014,"I honestly think Cheesecake is an appetizer and dessert kind of place. To me, the appetizers sound much more tastier than the main meals, and I've never been disappointed by them. Try the avocado rolls or the lettuce wraps. Plus, order a few and it will fill you up leaving room for dessert! And who can come to Cheesecake without getting cheesecake?!  There are so many to choose from, and they are all delicious! Just forget the main dish, it nothing to brag about. Although I must say that their mashed potatoes are good. This past time I went, I was not impressed by the meal, Chicken Madeira. I know it's one of their most popular selling dishes, but it just didn't do it for me. Just keep in mind that their portion sizes are HUGE! You can easily share a meal, or keep half for tomorrows lunch.  As far as service is concerned, this place is always busy, and you will always wait for a table. I don't mind eating indoors or on their outdoor patio, and that sometimes speeds up the wait time. On the downside, the last time I was here, the server and other staff were unprofessional about their coworkers and their responsibilities. Maybe they were comfortable serving our table, and therefore let their work-guard down, but it left a sour taste in my experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=140

The unorganized manager named Dora is classless and disrespectful. She has had my party of 26 people waiting for about 4 hours at this point, when she originally quoted 2. She got a very distasteful attitude because I have requested a status on our table repeatedly. I was not even offered a buzzer. I have never in the multiple years I have brought my family to dinner have ever experienced service this horrible. None of the hostesses wanted to tell me a timeframe they just told me to speak to the manager. The manager just repeatedly said there was nothing they can do. They tried to split our party because they did not properly start making room for a table for us. Then I spoke to her manager named Greg who acted very surprised but ALSO DID NOTHING.

Ryan L.,"Miami, FL",130,62,23,2.0,2/6/2016,"Say it isn't so...1 hr ticket time, completely forgotten orders, incorrect items, lack of appreciation on server's/management's part as it concerns the complete downward spiral of an experience, manager had nothing more to say than ""I'm sorry"" when I expressed our disappointing experience (and he struggled with that), consistent and continuous disorganization throughout the entire experience, and it just continued to the bitter end. This is particularly sad considering I am a huge fan, and the one to speak highly of a chain that is generally consistent a B+, which is more than many in the restaurant business can say.

The service not so much... the waiter wouldn't let us finish our sentences before he dashed off... which is very aggravating. I gave it four stars because this isn't the first time I've had bad service here. The food is wonderful tho I love the fresh bread and for an appetizer my favorites are the avocado egg rolls & tamales. As main dishes I like the chicken madeira, chicken piccatta and orange chicken. As for desert you can't go wrong with ANY cheesecake but my favorites are the tiramisu, Godiva chocolate, and Oreo cheesecake! Yum! I do have to also mention yes, I've gone a few times where the silverware wasn't cleaned properly but usually I just mention it to the server and get a fresh new set.

MICHELLE C.,"Plantation, FL",2316,2082,4453,2.0,10/12/2013,"My daughter and I were shopping and she wanted to come here. I was in the mood for a nice salad so I was ok with it. I have always enjoyed how large their menu is especially when you have no idea what your in the mood for. This menu helps satisfy any craving.  From the moment we sat our server took our drink order ASAP. He was rushing us for some reason. I was not digging his energy or attitude at all.  After finding a salad that seemed like a great choice I ordered the Carlton Salad. The menu stated balsamic dressing. I asked the server for extra dressing.  We ordered stuffed mushrooms to start and they were delightful.  The server had brought over a small cup of the dressing.  Immediately I was like oh that color, texture does not look good. I dipped my fork in it and ugh it was awful. Creamy texture with a robust taste of peanuts and sweet.  I'm like WTH. Minutes has passed when I called our server over to the table. I first asked if possible he gave me the wrong dressing. He said no that's the balsamic. I asked if he could make sure the dressing was not poured on my salad and I would choose another. He rudely said well I'm sure your salad is done so nothing I can do. Mind you this is after I told him how awful it was.  Ok long story short my salad came out with the awful dressing on it. I asked for another dressing to pour on top to try and mask the flavor. The salad was fresh, it would have been perfect if not for the peanut dressing,  When a manager came over she said yes that's the right dressing. I explained to her either they should specify peanut dressing on the menu or explain what it taste like to guest if they order it. Luckily I don't have a peanut allergy otherwise I would be dead.  This just really put a bad taste in my mouth how they handled it. She did say if I disliked it she would replace it with another salad. Well my daughters food was out and I did not want to wait for another salad.  For me this was a case of really bad word choices on the menu.

I came here with a friend on a recent Sunday at around 12:30 for brunch.  We were seated at a table for 2 in front of the place (in other words, in the cordoned off area that juts out into one of the main interior corridors here at Dadeland Mall), and we were then basically neglected for the remainder of our time here.  We placed our orders and we noticed that nearby tables who'd ordered after us received their food several minutes before we did.  The glass of water I ordered with my beverage never came until I asked for it again when our food was finally delivered.  Once we were done with our meals, we sat there for quite a few minutes with no one checking on us before I finally asked one of the other servers for the check. After the check was delivered and we placed our cards inside the pouch, again, it was quite some time before she finally returned to take our payment.   We noted that most of the tables around us had one particular waiter, and our waitress was kind of the ""odd man out"" in our section, so I'm unsure if we got there before the other guy started his shift, or if she had several tables to tend to inside and was only taking care of us when she remembered to come out front to check on us, or what the situation was. Aside from the poor service, our meals were fine - the potatoes I'd ordered were quite good and my omelet was so large I could barely finish it (this isn't surprising, considering The Cheesecake Factory is known for their gigantic portions).  If the service would've been better, they'd have probably received another star.  Total for his breakfast sandwich, my omelet, a glass of milk and a glass of OJ came to $31.43 before gratuity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=120

I know I realize that's a big party, so I tell the hostess that we don't mind waiting for our table, so she says wait about 30-45 min. If anything make sure to check back in in 30 min. So we wait 30 min and go back. I check in to see where we're at in the waiting and the hostess said that they gave our table away?!? So I'm already a bit upset at this point so I tell the hostess that that's unfair since they hadn't even buzzed me to go back!? She apologizes and says 20 min more max we'd have to wait. So she then gives me a new buzzer because the first one didn't even buzz!!  So we sit in the restaurant this time and wait about 10 min. We get seated by a waiter called Sebastian, says a few things for organization since we're a big party. Just as I thought things couldn't get worse, throughout the course of the rest of the night the waiter takes 20-40 min in between to give us our bread, drinks, take our orders, give us our food, collect our plates, take our orders for dessert, collect our plates, give us our bills.. He didn't even come back to the table to apologize for the wait, or check to see if we were doing okay, if the food was okay?? My plate of food wasn't even filled up all the way!!

Since I dined with a group of 7, we devoured the bread in a few seconds! But the server brought us more brown bread within seconds, which was fresh and warm. I ordered a spicy chipotle chicken pasta to share with my sister, the portion was HUGE! Which I'm happy for because it makes the price worth it. The pasta was thrown in a creamy redish sauce, hence the the ""spicy"" part, and tortilla chips were added in for a crunchy kick, which was enjoyable. It was yummy, but not as yummy as the regular chipotle pasta they used to have. I guess they took it off the menu unfortunately, still a pleasant  entree though! To end the meal, we ordered a tiramisu cheesecake. I absolutely love the way they fused tiramisu cake with cheesecake, with the powdered top, bottom tiramisu cake texture, and cheesecake middle. It was light, the chocolate whip cream on top wasn't too heavy but a fluffy cream. Perfection.

Every time I come here and Anthony serves us I can rest assure that the food always comes out exactly how it is ordered.

Of course I love the desserts!  I have eaten here several times when staying at the Marriott Miami Dadeland. It's an easy walk from the hotel.

Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated.

Gabriel Q.,"Miami, FL",24,61,89,2.0,6/21/2014,"Stopped by for lunch with my wife. Have dined here before and was looking forward to a great experience. I was wrong. Service was disappointing. When the time came for lunch entree orders the server only asked me what I wanted after my wife had ordered and prompted him to ask (he has already begun to walk away). Only after it became clear I was upset (well after my wife's salad has been served) did he ask if everything was ok.  As for the food - the avocado egg rolls had an overpowering sundried tomato flavor; they were crisp, but with an off putting metallic aftertaste. Wife enjoyed them (she loves sundried tomato, so their heavy handed inclusion didn't faze her). The tuna carpaccio was pretty dreadful; wasabi aioli with little flavor (might as well have been mayo), and a sweetness to the dish that totally overpowered the tuna.  As I write this I'm still hungry, and heading somewhere else for food. What could have been a wonderful lunch was very disappointing; so much so that I left my Blue Moon Ale untouched, paid the bill and left.

Sarah C.,"Miami, FL",0,41,2,2.0,1/4/2015,"First and last time coming here. I came out with the family for what I hoped to be a small, quiet, birthday dinner. We ended up being disappointed with just about every part of the meal. First of all, a 40 minute wait in heels with absolutely nowhere to sit was terrible. The entire waiting area was a circus. It looked like the entrance to some kind of overrated night club. The hostesses were attempting to yell names over the roar of the crowd. Apparently the pagers they give you are completely pointless because if you stray out of yelling range you'll never get sat. The experience didn't get too much better once we eventually were seated. It was still incredibly loud at our table even though we were sitting in a separate dining area from the main restaurant. Our waitress was barely ever around and every time she was at the table she seemed like she was in a rush to get away again. I ordered the baja chicken tacos. They were so soggy that they fell apart completely every time I took a bite. Thankfully the tortilla chips I had leftover from the spinach dip actually made the dish edible. Another person ordered garlic noodles with shrimp which was just overly greasy pasta with 4 overcooked shrimp. The other people at the table were happy with their salads. Dessert was the best part but they couldn't get that right either. We ordered 2 different cheesecakes which were delicious and an apple crisp that looked like ****. It was literally swimming in melted ice cream and had a huge exaggerated dollop of whipped cream in the middle. Not to mention ""Happy Birthday""  written in chicken scratch on the plate. Horrible presentation. Once I got rid of 80% of the whipped cream and swam through the ice cream soup to get to the actual dessert, it was delicious. I'm only giving it the 2nd star because the spinach dip and the cheesecake were good. Other than that this place was a complete disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=220

Unfortunately this time the service couldn't be worse from the moment that we put our names in the waiting list till the moment that we were seated. When I called the manager Casey he listened and then told me ""I perfectly understand because when I go out with my wife twice a week it means more to me than the rest of the week at work"" and left. No acknowledgement of the issue, apology or addressing the issue. I guess that for him he doesn't care about one customer when he have a 45 min waiting time at the door. As a manager of a hotel, for me is extremely important that every single customer is happy and extremely satisfied with their experience in my hotels regardless how good I may be doing in revenue. For me one single unhappy customer is as important as 100 happy ones.  I guess at this point I will be going to someplace else when in Miami and I'm sure Casey doesn't care.

They serve me mine so I ate my meal without my wife it hurts after I was done, I had to wait for her to finish and then they showed up with the bill with nothing discounted after in 2 hours and 20 minutes my wife complained I stood up and left they tried to pass off with two pieces of cheesecake , I find that insulting and ridiculous.

Abigail P.,"Homestead, FL",57,63,24,4.0,9/7/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory definitely has a menu that can practically satisfy anyone's cravings. The portions are rather large, of good quality, and almost never disappoint in taste. As far as customer service, each server I've had tries their hardest for a positive experience. I appreciate their attentiveness and knowledge of the menu. That's rather very important to me when I am deciding what to have that meal since I'm very indecisive.

Jorge M.,"Miami, FL",693,499,5495,4.0,1/29/2012,What can i say. This is one of the rare  chain restaurants that i like! Its located in Dadeland mall. Parking is everywhere if you are one of the Lucky's ones who find it. Just come before 12 if you can for lunch and theirs plenty of parking.The restaurant is large plenty of seating and bar area is a nice size. When I Go I normally sit at the bar and catch up on sports on their TVs. People dont like to eat their food at the bar but i do.Great service and food comes out quicker I have noticed. The restaurant and bathrooms are kept clean.The staff and bartenders are great. My favs to get are the stuffed mushrooms on their small plate menu and their Crusted Chicken Romano with Spaghetti. Sooo Good. Then comes dessert. Its the hardest thing to chose on their menu in my opinion. I go for their Dulce de Leche Cheesecake. Mmmmmmmmmmmm just getting hungry writing this review.

The reason why I only gave it 4-stars is because our server was a little pushy on getting our order in but with so many options, it's hard to just choose something!!  On the other hand, there is always a wait to come here...it doesn't fail. So I understand if he was trying to get us out in order to accommodate those that are wait but still...

Sarah F.,"Miami, FL",1,10,6,1.0,1/31/2014,"Let me start by saying that I've never really been a fan of this place: gargantuan off-putting serving sizes, mostly subpar food (except for the Cheesecake, of course) and bizarre Egyptian Art Deco-y unidentifiable themed decor. But, the last time I went there really took the cake (or should I say, ""cheesecake"" buh dum tiss) for terrible experiences.  I ordered the Evely's Favorite Pasta, which tasted kind of sour and wasn't very good but I was starving, so didn't complain.  Two of my friends had the Fettucini Alfredo... big mistake. We leave, and go along our merry way to hang out at a lounge. About an hour into our fun girl's night out, my friend runs to the bathroom and gets sick. Mind you, we didn't drink and we hadn't eaten for hours before going to cheesecake.  About two hours after that, we decide to head back to my place and head our separate ways. My other friend who had the Alfredo, says she feels fine, says good bye and gets into her car. As soon as she turns on the car, she swings open the car door and yacks violently all over my driveway. Coincidence? I think not!  The next day, we call to complain. Well, that didn't work out initially. The manager who I spoke with was extremely dismissive. He had the audacity to tell me, ""Well, we make all of our sauces for each plate from scratch, it's not like they're sitting there in one batch."" Really? Really guy? You're going to tell me that you people make sauces from SCRATCH for each individual order you get on a very busy Friday night and yet manage to take only 10 minutes to get it to your customer? You must think I had a botched lobotomy, or something. Even if you did in fact, make each sauce individually, it doesn't negate from the fact that the ingredients may not have been fresh. I highly doubt it was pure coincidence that both of my friends got sick from the same exact dish when they hadn't eaten anything but that in several hours.  Luckily, we called later that day and the second manager was extremely professional and apologetic. He gave us the information to report the incident to corporate.  Moral of the story: Stay away the Fettucini Alfredo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=200

Gregory N.,"Miami, FL",63,190,1,3.0,1/26/2011,"Been awhile since I have visited this place, but my son wanted to go there on a recent visit back from college.  It is located at Dadeland Mall, and parking is ridiculously bad.  Brain dead mall management has annexed even more parking spaces nearby the restaurant entrance for valet parking, so there are lots of empty spaces that you can't park in!  Instead, you have to battle other mall customers for very limited spaces a couple hundred yards away from where you want to go. What can I say about the food?  This place is always packed for some reason, must be the food.  I have never been seated immediately, there is always a wait.   They have a menu with enough items to fill up a season of TV cooking shows.  Even so I have settled in on the Chicken Madeira and that's all I ever order.  It's a tasty invention of boneless chicken breasts with cheese and aspargus served with mashed potatoes.  This last time I went, the mashed potatoes took over the plate as the chicken has been reduced in size, and their corporate policy must be to not let any bare plate be showing. I don't get the cheesecake any more because I want to avoid the calorie overload.  But if you must, you can be assured of a tasty slice of cheesecake dressed up in multiple different flavors or toppings.  Be kind to your body and share a piece with someone so you don't have to schedule a five mile run the next day. Finally, this is not a bad place to go with a group of people, or if you and the family have been shopping at Dadeland all day.  You'll get good service and a wide selection of food options.  And like I said, it's always crowded, so they must be doing something right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=320

My favorite meals: Chicken Madeira, Steak Diane, herb crusted salmon. Favorite cheesecake: used to be oreo but they recently changed it and now it's the chocolate coconut cream.  The other great thing about the cheesecake factory is that there is just about every kind of food you can imagine, so anyone can find something they would like here.  Lately, whenever I'm going to have food from here, I prefer to order as take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=320

Judy D.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",2,190,,3.0,1/13/2015,"It's difficult to rate the different food chains because there are so many layers involved.  We had lunch at this location yesterday and it was a mix of food and entertainment.  Thank goodness for valet parking at Dadeland or nobody would choose to use a quarter tank of gas looking for parking.  We were seated quickly, which was somewhat unusual.  Often, we've had to wait a half hour or more during peak times.  Our server was a cheerful blonde gal who seemed to actually enjoy her job.  She was slammed with tables but soldiered on with a smile.  Keep her!!!  Better yet, give her some kind of promotion or bonus!  Now to the food....  We ordered the Caesar salad, tomato/basil pasta and espresso.  IMO, the Caesar has always been good as it's not dripping in dressing which is something I REALLY dislike.  The pasta was cooked al dente and the chicken and sauce were tasty but too oily for my liking.  Something too cheesy and wet killed the stuffed mushrooms for me and hubby's arugula salad was a mess of stems and difficult to get on a fork but it tasted good.  For me and for many other customers, if you guys don't clean up those super slick floors, somebody is going to own a big chunk of corporate, if you get my drift.  Customers shouldn't have to ""skate"" around the restaurant!  A one star for safety/greasy floor issues.

Now, of course you gotta have cheesecake for dessert, right? WRONG! If you are a frequent customer like me, please try the non-cheesecake options.

Not worth the $16. For desert, I got the blueberry and white chocolate cheesecake; pretty good, but it had only 2 blueberries in a giant slab of a slice. The service on this visit was not good at all.  The server appeared promptly when we first sat down and from then on made rare appearances at the wrong times.

Jose P.,"Miami, FL",78,20,6,4.0,5/21/2013,"Me and my girlfriend come to this place at least 2 times a month. The ahí tar tar is really good as a small appetizer if you go with a bigger group the fried calamari are perfect for sharing. As for the main course you can't go wrong with a burger, but if you want something a bit different the chicken Romano and the shepherds pie are really good. Things to avoid are the burrito, the fish tacos which are incredibly bad, the pasta with sun dried tomatoes is Bland. On most days the services is great but like everything if you go enough times you are bound to have a bad one",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=300

The server was very polite and helpful, took her time to answer our questions about their new skinny menu, which I may say it's great. The food was very good and my daughter's Oreo shake was the bomb.  The managers stop by our table to make sure our service was good. I think more restaurants should do this more often. I mention to my husband that even the girl that brought our food to the table made sure we were set before she left. Yes it might be a little loud but who cares when service and food are great.

Cecile S.,"Miami, FL",172,225,208,5.0,2/16/2011,"Wow Cheesecake Factory my favorite! I really mean it. I work across from dadeland mall so I tend to go during their lunch hour, which is still busy, but easy to get a spot at the high tables.  I wish I could say I typically order the salad(Chinese Chicken Salad or Cobb!! Yumm). But with so many great things on the menu I can't do it. We usually get two appetizers or an appetizer and a meal to share since the portions are huge and we do unfortunately have to go back to work.  My favorites are the Mexican egg rolls, avocado egg rolls, chicken quesadilla, factory nachos, and the sweet corn tamale. They have also added small plates. I've had the pizza and its a decent size and really tasty. As for meals I love the chicken madeira, chicken and biscuits, baja chicken tacos, vegetable pizza, and chicken piccatta. I haven't really gone for their meat dishes.  Dessert: Snickers Cheesecake hands down takes the prize,  but at this restaurant when is their ever space for dessert? I have also had a seasonal mango cheesecake that was fantastic.  Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything you order everything is awesome! I've always had great service very quick and on point.

It was so packed with people waiting for tables that even the waiters had trouble moving around. We weren't allowed to be seated until our entire party had arrived (fine...) We had to give up our table. When everyone was ready, the hostess (don't know her name, but she had about a pound of dark eyeshadow on) promised we would get the next available table. Then she seated a different group and refused to acknowledge her mistake. She got pretty snappy, which I thought was incredibly rude, but that's Miami for you, I guess...

Cristina G.,"Miami, FL",9,33,10,1.0,12/14/2014,Today I went to cheesecake factory for an early birthday dinner with my fiancé. I was so excited to eat here because it is my favorite restaurant but unfortunately it wasn't a great experience. Once we sat down we waited about 15 mins before anyone came to even take our drink order or say hello. Then we ordered an appetizer. Again about 15-20 mins before the waiter came to take our dinner order. Then we asked when our appetizer was coming and he said he was going now to get it. About 20 mins later our dinner came out and yet the appetizer never came. So we had to cancel it which was a disappointment. We never got refills on our water. The best part of my dinner was the dessert at the end which took 30 mins to come out. Then we were given the wrong bill and had to wait again for the waiter to come back and ask for the correct check. I just wish that there would've been some sort of apology for forgetting us the entire time we were there. I never thought that at a restaurant we needed to be searching for the waiter the whole time in hopes of being noticed. We are very disappointed and I hope it never happens again. I would love for my experiences here to always be pleasant because now I feel like we paid for bad service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=300

From the Fried Mac n' Cheese, to the Cajun Chicken ""Littles,"" everything has always been great. My newest favorite is the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta with chicken and it is outstanding! I recommend it to anyone who likes spicy food. I also make it a point to try a new cheesecake every time I go, and the latest discovery has been the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It is honestly, to die for.

I've had an issue with the one in Dolphin Mall since it opened up and now I've noticed the Dadeland Mall having the same issues. Dirty and stinky restrooms, distrust cups, utensils, and plates. And problems with the food the majority of the time. And not only a problem with what is ordered but the quality of the food has gone way down.  My family and I headed over yesterday for Easter Sunday. 8 of us and half had a problem with our orders. It was absolutely not the waiters fault he was more than wonderful with us even after all our issues. It was absolutely not the waiters fault he was more than great with us after all. My sister and I also noticed that the white bread has changed.  We have been regulars at cheesecake since we were little girls back in the 90s so we notice the change tremendously. I did notice the managers walking around a lot... apparently a lot of customers had complaints yesterday.  I'm so disappointed with Cheesecake Factory mostly because this is the place I've gone too for so long and it's picked first automatically by my family and friends. It's a no brainier and now we have to second guess it. I've always believed chain restaurants have all the same problem. The more you grow the less quality and service you give. 20 years ago Cheesecake Factory locations were not everywhere and sure enough not more than 1 maybe 2 locations in each city as I remembered. Chain restaurants have been out my options for a good 6 years now. As an adult I've learned to not waste my money on them and when I find a dead end and must step foot in one it hurts. There are a handful amount of chain restaurants I am okay with and Cheesecake Factory was definitely one.  .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=100

Our waiter on the other hand was very dry and rude. He didn't seem to like this job. The portions of food are huge. The hamburgers are great, the pasta da Vinci's really good, and the cheesecake is even better!!  We got the Oreo cheesecake and the White chocolate raspberry cheesecake (I believe that's what it was called) The cheesecakes really light and wonderful! When you order ask for extra whip cream!The whip cream there is great, it's so smooth, and great to put on your cheesecake! the Oreo cheese cake tasted more like chocolate , I was hoping for a more Oreo   looked as if they had taken the Oreo cheesecake and dipped in chocolate and then sprinkled Oreo crumbs over it. The chocolate overpowered The Oreo cheesecake.  The other cheesecake that we got, the white chocolate raspberry,was excellent. I don't like raspberries but this cheesecake change my opinion about it! Ha ha ha! The reason I'm giving this place three stars is because our waiter was rude and it's kind of expensive. I mean, $54 for a whole cheesecake, I can buy one at Publix for $30.

For dessert, I enjoyed a nice big slide of the ""Oreo Extreme"" cheesecake. The cheesecake was cold, cheesy, and even chunky with real Oreo cookie chunks inside, as well as an Oreo cookie crust at the bottom. I loved this fine dinning lunch experience.

The complimentary sweet brown bread (I want to say it's pumpernickel but I'm honestly not sure, not really a bread person) is just so warm and delish with butter that begins to melt as soon as you spread it. Omg that bread is so damn good but watch it, you can get sucked in and ruin a bit of your appetite because you can't seem to stop eating it ( it's happened to me plenty of times). I came here on a Saturday night with my parents so be prepared, the place was packed. We chose to skip the wait and found a tall table top in the bar area. I wish I remembered our waitresses name because she was dynamite!!! But she was quick, helpful, and just a sweetheart all together. I asked her a million questions about different menu items because of course anxiety kicked in and I wanted everything. She helped me make the best decision and we were all satisfied with our meals and  our bottle of red.

It takes time just to get cheesecake to go. *Added 11/21/12 My recent trip to this Cheesecake Factory warranted an addition to my review and the loss of a star. So while I enjoyed a great meal, I decided to go to the cheesecake counter and get a slice to go. With 5 employees there, I figured it wouldn't take too long. I waited probably 5 minutes before anyone even said a word to me. They never acknowledge my presence. Finally, I asked one of them if I could get an order in and they said the cashier would be right with me. Turns out the cashier was none of them but another girl who finally came back. Now I can understand that they may be busy but here is how you handle the situation properly. If you are getting the cheesecakes ready and you see a customer standing, waiting for service, if you can help him, you do so. If you can't, at least tell him ""sorry for the delay, someone will be right with you"" or something to that extent. DO NOT IGNORE HIM. It really pisses me off when I get poor customer service and I guess I this place, you might run into that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=340

But between the long wait and mediocre, overpriced food, so not worth it.  I find little to recommend here.  The menu is unweildy.  They dont even know what cuisine they're about.  I think this must be made for middle America where they dont have independently owned international restaurants.

I told them I did not want replacements and even told the manager after he came to my table. So I ate the rest of my meal. After I was done eating, a side of sweet potato fries arrived at my table, approximately 20 minutes later.  They were hot and good, but I was full, and had asked that they not be made.  Then the bill came, which I paid. Upon looking over the bill, I found that the restaurant had charged me for the sweet potato fries, and when I questioned the server, it was not an oversight. Afterwords the manager offer to take the dollar off the bill.

Perfection.  Both entrees were great. The chipotle pasta was nice and spicy but not overbearing. The fettucine also had a terrific flavor.  OH, wait! We had the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer. SO good. At first, I thought- Hmmm, warm avocados, that's going to be weird - But, NO! They were very good. We topped off our gluttonous meal with a slice of heaven.

Kaleena S.,"Miami, FL",86,136,2,4.0,4/30/2009,"Ah the cheescake factory,  my solid back up for a decent place to go to celebrate a [insert random thing to celebrate here]. The one thing i can say about this place is come hungry! The portions are huge! and if you come at lunch you might be able to get the lunch special. The lunch special is described as a lunch portion for a lunch price.. but my insiders tell me its the same dinner portion for just the lunch price. Good buy! For almost all of their dishes you can split with some one, if not plan to take home some of it. I love food but ive never been able to finish one of their dishes by myself.  You really need to go with a ""how hungry am i?"" plan when you go here. My food-game plan? i plan on just meal and cheesecake and i take home half of each.  If you like green tea they have a sweet green tea you can get, it comes with mint, so if you can do with out the mint, make sure to ask.  Ah the Cheesecake.... i have gone time and time again and the one rule is everyone orders a different cheesecake. I have been there more times than i can count and i still have not tried them all. Cookie dough, tuxedo, brownie sundae, banana, vanilla bean are some of my favorite regulars. Tip: Always ask if there is something not on the menu, a lot of times the servers forget to mention they have seasonal specials that are just delish. Some seasonal faves that i have enjoyed include  a white chocolate blueberry, and pistachio. YUM! Some ppl think its pricey, i think its fine for the service and food you get. If i dont come up with a plan for my birthday soon ill probably have this place as my back up. Yay cheescake! oh side note: they have pick up so if your just passing by and dont want to eat in.. it may be an option.

Then we started off with the pear and cheese flatbread which was delicious and some coffee that was spot on.  On to the main entrees, I had the montecristo which was not that good, they do it on french toast bread which was soggy and not properly toasted making it not that flavorful as i was hopeing for, the only good twist was they brought strawberry jame as most places give it with raspberry compote and hash browns which were cold, I left them completely.  My husband had the hurvos rancheros which the tortilla(quesadilla) portion to me was horrible.  We then proceeded to go with the pina colada cheesecake which was a first for me on the menu, i defeintely did not like and nor my husband and he usually likes anything sweet, we left a piece of it, that tells you a lot, as most cheesecakes are so good that you have to eat it all.   Service was excellent and atmosphere was great as it wasnt too full since it was before 12.  Defintely will be back but not ordering those plates.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=340

Diverse range of food. It's the only restaurant I know whose big menu doesn't translate into sub-par offerings. I know that their Italian pasta dishes will be pretty decent along with their Tex-Mex, Southern, Asian dishes.  2. They are open relatively late, ya.  Till  12:30AM, Friday-Saturday! In the Dadeland area! If I am too lazy to venture far, this place will do when I have some free money to spend, especially for luxe take-out. In the  Gables/S.Miami corridor, the only things that late that are open are Dennys and TGI Fridays (yech). Hey, who wants some pasta carbonara or chicken-biscuits with some cheesecake to go? Hells yeah. 3. The wait staff are no worse then the service you'd get at Miami Beach, in fact, I think they are not that bad, perfunctorary, and look, the long waits are because it's CHEESECAKE FACTORY!

As we walked into the place, I felt like we were going to have to wait forever but were only stuck with a 20 minute wait. I can live with that. As we sit down, they bring us our bread and drinks and we begin to look through the menu. The menu that has over a million (not really) options. This is going to to take a while. 10 minutes later, I decided on the shepards pie and my brother and friend got the da vinci pasta. They were both extremely good. For appetizers we got edamame, onion rings, and some rolls. I don't suggest the onion rings. They weren't crispy enough for my liking. When we were done we got the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake and I was super excited to eat it. I might get shot for saying this but I was kind of dissappointed.

My favorite salad would have to be the chinese chicken salad, the peanut ginger sauce is incredible, they add some white fried noodles on top that gives it an extra crunch. The fried mac n' cheese is a must!  Last time i went i tried the Hibachi steak, DELICIOUS. they serve it with mashed potatoes and with asparagus tempura.  In regards to their drink menu, a little pricey but they are amazing.

It makes me try new things and there is always at least three to four things that have me salivating (which then causes me great grief since I only have one stomach to eat one of the amazing entrees and plus I have to save room for dessert)... Dessert! The reason why this place gets a five star rating. Their phenomenal selection of cheesecake! Be prepared people because they have not one but two pages of cheesecake flavors. All the flavors are mouthwatering, I always have to play eenie meenie minee moe with the cheesecakes just to pick which one to eat that day. I have yet to find one that didn't leave me begging for more. But I don't like cheesecake...**collective gasp**...besides that being impossible in my mind, (ok ok it is possible, I just really like cheesecake, it's ok if you don't like it.) they have a whole array of different non cheesecake desserts which are sure to appeal to the non cheesecake eaters of the group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=280

Of course i only got to eat half the dish bc it was HUGE, but besides all was probably one of the best chickens i'd ever ate!! But the best part for sure, was the dessert. We couldnt leave The Cheesecake Factory without trying obv their famous and signature dessert, the cheesecake, but we were kinda full so we decided to order one cheesecake for my sister and I (my mom just took a bite). And then we found ourselves in the front of a 30 plus cheesecake menu!!!!! We wanted a classic one but they all looked amazing. We ended up choosing the most famous one, Oreo Cheesecake. I was speechless, i really mean it. It was one of the best things i'd ever had in my life. It was huge too, topped with a gigant oreo and had like these lawyers of oreo, milk chocolate mousse and some other delish things!

We reply water and he just leaves without even asking if we want an appetizer and are ready to order. I'm from miami so I don't scare easily and just thought maybe he was having a rough day. I decided to be patient. The waiter proceeds to attend to both tables next to us wth a smile on his face. This goes on for about 15 minutes until he comes to take our order. We ask for bread since we're starving and again he seems in a  rush. We receive 4 breads (smallest basket ever) around 10 minutes after that and our waiter is still in a rush and doesn't even ask if we are ready to order. He again goes to serve and converse with the other two tables. At this point, both my sister and I are noticing that he definitely has an issue with us specifically. We get his attention and he reluctantly takes our order in a rush again. We barely get a word in and he seems bothered to answer our questions. He rushes off again. We waited about 45 minutes for our burgers and of course the order is wrong. During this time we didn't have any contact with the waiter ( not even to refill water). He continues to skip over us and go to the next table. We decide to leave our food untouched and just let the hostess know that we had a bad experience and would like to leave. I asked her if she needed me to pay for the bread and she said no. We left hungry and headed to Bobby's burgers which was awesome!!!. I was so disappointed because I do love cheesecake factory and have many great memories there.

Betty A.,"Miami, FL",52,78,8,4.0,7/8/2012,"Yesterday Saturday my boyfriend and I were going to the movies nearby but before, we stopped by Cheesecake factory in order to have dinner. We were impressed. First of all, we got there around 8 p.m. and saw that there was a big line just to place our name in the list. We waited in line for about 7 minutes and then we were told there was 10 minutes wait for our party of 2. That was fine for us compared to what we heard to other parties waiting in line: 25 minutes. However, our name was called in about 5 minutes. Very fortunate. We were seated and we perused the menu until our waiter Jose came to greet us. He told us about the specials for the day and we proceed to order. I wanted to drink something refreshing with a little alcohol and decided on the while Sangria. Jose truly recommended it and even told me that if I did not like it he would gladly exchange it. Usually they bring out a basket of white and pumpernickel bread. My boyfriend, knowing we had the same taste, told our waiter to bring out only white bread.  While we were waiting for our drinks and decided on our entrees, our water and bread with butter immediately came. I ordered the chicken teriyaki which consisted of chicken breast charbroiled with teriyaki sauce, served with steamed rice. My boyfriend ordered the Orange Chicken which was deep fried pieces of chicken breast covered in a sweet and spicy orange sauce. Served with white rice and vegetables. Ok so my White Sangria was delicious. Very fruity, sweet and refreshing. My teriyaki chicken was great. What I did not know is that the chicken is served with the skin which the teriyaki sauce is on it. I don't eat chicken skin,  and if i known that I would have ordered to take the skin off and place the teriyaki on top of the skinless breast but it was tasty after all. I rubbed my meat on top of it just to give it the teriyaki flavor and the steamed rice had a bit of the teriyaki sauce on the side of it just to make it sweeter. I tasted a piece of my boyfriend's Orange Chicken and it was great but glad I did not ordered that plate as I was not in the mood of eating fried food that evening. He said it was very good.

Yesterday, I ordered their ""Weight Management Chicken"" which is a good portion of thinly pounded grilled chicken breast served over a (small) bed of white rice, arugula & tomatoes dressed in a bit of balsamic vinaigrette.  This has been my go-to dish for some time now when I'm looking for something on the healthier side. I also love their brunch, particularly the California Omelet (avocado, garlic, shallots, cheese), and their Belgian Waffles with fresh strawberries and cream. Oh and we shouldn't forget the cheesecake!!  Godiva Chocolate, tuxedo, white chocolate macadamia nut are some of my faves.

They give you a ton of tortilla chips...this sort of ""bigger is better"" concept applies to the soda glasses too, cuz why are they so big? But I love it. Service was also really good. Two of my friends had the shepherd's pie. Mixed reviews: N is this tiny skinny New York boy who never ever eats. In the three years we've been friends, I kid you not, I have never seen him finish a meal.  Much to everyone's surprise, N ate the whole thing! He said it was amazing and comfort food and even then he ordered the tiramisu cheesecake (which he ate two bites of. go figure.) The other friend who had the shepherd's pie took a couple of bites and then took the rest home to her roommate. She had the strawberry cheesecake which is good...but it was plain cheesecake with literally three strawberries on it. C had an avocado chicken club (big, with fresh avocado, but otherwise nothing special) and the chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. Devoured both, and I got to try her cheesecake, which was super chocolatey and delicious.  I had the banana cheesecake, and it's now replaced white chocolate raspberry truffle and the carmel macadamia nut white chocolate cheesecake as a favorite.  Everything came out really fast (I have no idea how they do it) but the wait at the Dadeland one is always silly on a busy night...but you're at a mall, so you can go powershop at Zara while you wait. Good stuff. Five stars, mostly because every time I eat there, I leave thinking I never want to eat again, and then the very next day, I want to go back. I can't, though, or I'd get broke and huge...but it's okay, cuz I got leftovers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=360
Laily B.,"Miami, FL",2,21,17,4.0,8/13/2009,"I hadn't been to this location in over a year.  The last time I went, the food was not good at all, the service was awful and I stopped going.  I returned recently to indulge a friend from out of town.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the food was pretty good.  It's not the most amazing food ever, but they do a good job.  I had the Thai Chicken lettuce wraps.  It's an appetizer, but it's so large that you can actually make a meal out of it and still have room for dessert.  Other times when I've ordered pasta or some other entree, I just can't even think about having dessert.  Our server was very pleasant and made sure we had everything we needed without being pushy.  Food was fresh and tasty.  Cheesecake was sinful, but a little too sweet if you eat the whole thing. Dislike:  Portions are obscenely large.  Sometimes the wait for a table is ridiculous. Like:  Desserts are on display so you can actually see what appeals to you the most.  Bread basket is awesome..warm and freshly baked.  Iced tea is a passionfruit blend (unsweetened), very fruity and refreshing. Price: In my opinion, it feels like the prices are a little bit high, almost as if they're justifying the humongous portion, which could easily feed 2 people.  So it does annoy me because 1.  You're not always in the mood to share with someone (maybe you want different things).  2.  It's too easy to stuff yourself.  3.  Either you take it home, or it goes to waste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=360

Bring hungry folk and chow down. Began with the crispy crab wontons, Fresh Crabmeat Blended with Cream Cheese, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts and Sweet Chili Sauce, they were awesome.  Followed by chicken and biscuits, Breast of Chicken Served over Mashed Potatoes with Shortcake Biscuits, Mushrooms, Peas and Carrots. Covered with Country Gravy.  I could not finish my plate.  Might be due to the fact that I stuffed my face with bread before the appetizers got there...  Needless to say I didn't have cheesecake.

I went to lunch today with my family and we decided to come here. We were seated right away which was surprising for a Saturday on a long weekend.  Our waiter Jonathan came to introduce himself and take our drink orders with bread in hand ( which was great). Once we ordered or drinks it took him a good 10 minutes to come back with them. Mind you, we ordered waters and coca cola's, nothing fancy that had to be made at the bar.  When he finally came to drop off the drinks we ordered our food. I ordered the same thing I got one week ago- the Louisiana Chicken Pasta but instead of the sauce the pasta comes with and the veggies I wanted a white sauce (I cannot tell you how many times, in the history of my existence I have ordered this- but since cheesecake used to be my all time favorite restaurant let's just say A LOT). I'm not sure if Jonathan was new but he seemed quite confused with my order. We asked him to bring more bread as well.  20 more minutes passed and our drinks were empty and watered down and had just then received the extra bread we had asked for. After 20 more minutes of waiting (still with empty drinks) he finally returned to the table to ask if it was okay with me that the pasta had Cajun butter on it (which is normal to the Louisiana Chicken Pasta dish), which makes the dish spicy, after I had clearly stated I ONLY wanted white sauce. No veggies, not the sauce that it usually comes with, white sauce... Obviously this was not okay with me. He returned to nowhere land or wherever it was that he kept hiding out for about another 20 minutes. We were all starving at this point and had been here for an hour already...He finally started bringing out the dishes 2 at a time. Of course everyone else got there food before I did. And when my dish finally came it wasn't even Jonathan that brought it out! He had someone else bring my dish for me (even though he had brought everyone else's out and we were 5...)  Anyways, the food was good. He got my order correct. He finally brought new drinks after we got our food. My grandma complained that her pasta was not cooked enough-it was pretty hard.

This was very tasty, it was featured on the ""specials menu"". My son had the kids spaghetti and meatball, and my girlfriend had the hibachi steak.

I mean I think this menu has about everything and can satisfy even the pickiest person you know. With such a large menu you can never get bored with the food. Even though for years Ive been stuck ordering the Miso Salmon because its just so good. Some days im feeling a little more sponaneous and order something new.  Either way, for sure a five star for me. Yes its a popular restaurant so depending on the day sometimes it will be crazy packed and you have to wait. A little tip, if youre with a small party and you see a table open in the bar area then that seating is first come first serve. So you can seat yourself and dine from there. THE BREAD IS FIIIIIRE. I always end up just asking for double ""brown bread"" because that one is my favorite. Just be careful not to kill it all and stuff yourself too much before your meal. Their plates tend to run a little on the bigger side.

A group of my co-workers and I went out to lunch but not all of us eat the same. We had a couple of vegetarians and a few others that were looking for a ""low calorie"" meal so we all agreed on TCF.   Went in around 11:45 AM to avoid the lunch rush hour. Thankfully the restaurant wasn't packed so a table for 9 was available within 2 minutes.   Our server, Michael T, quickly came to our table and gracefully offered water, took our drinks order, and brought some of that delicious bread. A few minutes later we ordered some appetizers: avocado rolls, fried mac and cheese, and edamame. The three of them were fabulous. (My favorite were the avocado rolls... yummmm!!)   After debating for 30 minutes on what to eat (no kidding!), I FINALLY decided to try the bang bang shrimp and chicken with brown rice. Presentation was a plus and portion was big enough to feed 2 people. However, I was a little disappointed when I came to find out that the ""bang bang"" sauce was not the one I had in mind. This one had a curry/peanut butter taste to it as opposed to the mayo/chili one from Bonefish and PF Changs. Although it was not what I was expecting, dish was still flavorsome and I took the left overs home.   To finish our ""food coma"" meal, we decided to order TWO cheesecakes: red velvet and s'mores.

I usually order the Americanah burger which has lettuce, tomato, bacon, crispy potato fries, and pink sauce. The burger comes with fries or with a salad. It's usually very good and I love it. It's huge so every time I eat it I feel very full. Sometimes we order the Vietnamese summer rolls which is a very Americanized version of this traditional dish but enjoyable enough.

Even though Cheesecake factory has expanded to other locations the quality of the food its not what it used to be, but regardless we are still loyal fans. We decided to have an early dinner last Monday, and went to the location in Dadeland Mall, and we were lucky to be seated right away. Depending on the day there can be long wait times, so plan accordingly.  Once you are seated they bring you complementary wheat and sourdough baguettes, which are amazing especially when they are bring it out nice and warm. I also take my time looking at the menu which looks like a mini bible, but don't get overwhelmed just pick different plates to share. This time we decided to order an old time favorite pot stickers and something new the avocado toast, and then the main entree we choose the Ahi Tuna with brown rice.  The Pot Stickers are pork dumpling steamed and then fried to give the brown crispy bottom, and then they soak it with a delicious soy vinegar. The avocado toast is a baguette toasted and then cut in half with a amazing spread of mashed avocado with red onions, olive oil,  tomatoes, and basil leaves. It was a delicious appetizer and healthier then other options. Then the main entree arrived and it did not disappoint, the tuna was rare as I requested and very fresh, they used a miso based sauce that went excellent with the brown rice.

I came for lunch to celebrate my birthday and overall it was just a disappointing experience. To start, the silverware was FILTHY. Disgustingly so. There were hard pieces of food stuck to almost every fork on the table and the knives had film on them. We brought it to our server's attention and the manager Linda promptly came to our table to apologize. She offered a complimentary entree or dessert, which was nice. However, the lunch experience continued to go downhill. The wait for our meals was entirely too long and the food was mediocre. My husband had the chicken teriyaki, which was dry, bland, and barely had any sauce on the chicken. For almost $17 it should be better... My chicken quesadilla was just ok. The cheesecake is always good, but don't think I haven't noticed the slices getting smaller and smaller- yet the price remains the same. Tsk, tsk. At the end of the meal, we had to remind the waiter of the comp the manager had promised.

Daniel D.,"Miami, FL",4,11,59,3.0,8/7/2017,"To start off right, I came here because of a gift card to burn. When asked for a table, they sat us outside of the restaurant but inside of the mall (literally outside of the doors of the restaurant in a gated area less than 20 feet from a kiosk with crowds walking by). I asked to be moved and they accommodated me.  I ordered the steak that came with two sides, breaded green beans and mashed potatoes and requested that the mashed potatoes be subbed with roasted broccoli. The person with me got their food before me and the server brought out the steak 10 minutes later with the ""breaded side"". We're talking 5 pieces of 1"" long green beans and a big empty space to the side. I waited another 10 minutes for the broccoli that looked like it was boiled and thrown in the oven with extra heat to make it roast quicker and was dry and tasteless on top and soggy and soft on the bottom. I asked the server to try another side and went with asparagus.  During this time, a manager came out and asked if we wanted them to take the steak back to keep warm while they prepared the asparagus. By this time, my friend had started his meal. When I asked about the side of green beans, he said that's exactly the portion they give and apologized for the empty space on the plate because since I ""asked for a substitution,"" they had to plate it separately. He was right. But why on Earth would you bring a half completed meal to the table? He acknowledged that was their mistake and offered me dessert to which I declined (damn you KetoDiet!). Eventually the asparagus came out and I had started eating the steak and had finished my gerbil sized portion of green beans (by this point people around had arrived after us and left already).

Thien H.,"Riverbank, CA",648,639,2941,2.0,6/17/2016,"Dadeland Mall's Cheesecake Factory is weak. It is especially weak when I compare it to Aventura's Cheesecake Factory. I had a pretty good experience at Aventura recently. Their happy hour foods were surprisingly good overall and it inspired me to try Dadeland's.  While the Chicken Sliders $5.50 were big and appetizing at Aventura, at Dadeland they were a joke. As you'll see from one of my photos, one chicken patty was hastily ripped in half to make two sliders. One of the chicken pieces was so small, it was basically a single bite. The Portabella, Avocado, and Zucchini fries $6.95 are extremely greasy. I couldn't continue eating them. The Guacamole $5.50 on our first visit to Dadeland was okay. The Mojito $5.50 was fine. The S'mores cheesecake $7.95 was the best dish. ______ On our second visit to Dadeland's Cheesecake Factory, the Guacamole $5.50 was very unappetizing looking. It had a very obvious brown/oxidized color to it. I thought that it was only brown on the top layer, but it was brown throughout. I dug deeper in several spots in the dish and it was all oxidized. I'm guessing they had a vat of old guacamole and made sure to send it to anyone who ordered off the happy hour menu. To top it off, I bit into the little nub of the avocado. That was unpleasant. This time we ordered it mild and it still had a bizarre spicy taste. It didn't taste like any type of chili I've tried before. It wasn't black pepper either. It tasted like it had been seasoned with pepper spray (the self -defense kind) or something. Very strange. The grossest thing we ate were the Beer Battered French Fries $6.95. Avoid this dish. It was nothing like we expected. I expected beer battered fries like those that are served with fried fish at a British pub. Instead, it was like they slow cooked the hefty potato sticks in barely warm oil first. Then they battered them with a thick and strange breading and fried it at too low of a temperature. The outside of the ""fries"" was technically crispy, but they were somehow not tasty. I usually love fried food, but the thoroughly oil-soaked fry was a huge disappointment.  I had tried the Ahi Tuna Tartare at Aventura and was looking forward to it here. The miniscule amount of tartare $7.95 was insulting. All of the tartare could fit inside one of those little plastic cups they use for ketchup. I still can't believe I just didn't send the dish back upon seeing it.  The Happy Hour Burger $5.50 was pretty basic. The only redeeming part of this particular meal was the Oreo Dream Cheesecake $7.95. At least the kitchen doesn't touch this dish. The cheesecake counter people just put a little bit of whipped cream next to it. I didn't think chain restaurants could vary so much. Dadeland Mall's location is skimpy on portions and the food is not properly cooked and/or their recipes are bad. If you really want Cheesecake Factory food, then I would suggest the Aventura or Dolphin Mall locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=20

Once again... if I didn't live so close and if their food wasn't so good I would never order from here! I called once and was put on hold for over 15 minutes...  I ended up hanging up, and called back and explained to the person who answered the phone what occurred only to be put on hold again. This was ridiculous so I got in my car and drove there (still on hold) there only to show the manager how long I've STILL been on hold and requested to show a manager how I was still on hold and my call history of how I had been on hold 15 minutes even prior to the call I was on.  The place wasn't even busy that day.  Another time I ordered (again I had been on hold forever) and I went to pick up my meal.  When I arrived, I watched 2 employees stare at the phone ring and each look at each other and tell one another to answer it... they refused. A manager was walking around the pick up/order area and heard the phone ringing and asked one of the two aforementioned employees, ""do you hear the phone? Are you going to answer it?"" They employee responded that he didn't hear the phone and proceeded to roll his eyes and answer it! This pissed me off because I am the guy that's always on hold FOREVER because of situations like that so I pulled the manager aside and told him everything I observed.  Don't know what happened after I left but he was appreciative that I brought it to his attention!

Steve H.,"Miami, FL",1,71,,5.0,4/22/2017,"I wasn't sure whether I should give four or five stars, because The Cheesecake Factory is not perfect, but it's so much better than most local joints, I felt five stars were justified. What can I say about it? It's The Cheesecake Factory. It has about ten million dishes and fifty different cuisines, and all the recipes are excellent. They prepare everything very well. When was the last time a restaurant served you pasta al dente? The Cheesecake Factory does it. You can have Chinese. You can have Mexican. You can have Italian. Got a party of people who can't agree on what to have? Take them to The Cheesecake Factory. Everyone will be happy. The last time I went, I had the pasta with shrimp and sausage. The sauce was wonderful. Very balanced. Lots of character. They didn't skimp on the butter or cheese. The lady who grated even more cheese on the pasta wasn't a miser, either. I hate it when they give you half a teaspoon of cheese and then stare at you, like you'll tell them to stop if they embarrass you. The Cheesecake Factory doesn't play that. They bury you in cheese unless you stop them. They also served fresh bread. A nice chewy sourdough and some kind of sweet brown bread, with butter on the side. Very nice. Can't beat it.  I've eaten there many times, and I've never had food or a mixed drink that was not excellent. The down side: parking is horrible unless you want to walk, and you WILL wait for a table. That's the price you pay for consistent quality. The atmosphere could be better. The restaurant is very busy, so sometimes you really do feel like you're in a  bustling factory. If you hate huge portions, you can order lunch portions. Very helpful. The lunch pasta I ordered had over a thousand calories, which is more than enough for a sane person. My companion had the dinner-sized spaghetti and meatballs, and I could barely see him over the top of it. The cheesecake is very good. Mine is much better, but then I have to cook it, whereas The Cheesecake Factory will cook it for me and bring it to me. If you don't mind a busy setting, a wait, and a bit of noise, this place will make you very happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=40

Alana A.,"Miami, FL",583,358,893,4.0,11/9/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is very good! I've never had a negative experience other than the wait times. This place gets packed and there's no calling ahead or making reservations, so just be patient and wait it out. Waiting has become more comfortable now ever since they expanded the restaurant and put more benches in the new waiting area.  Now onto the rest of the experience.... The food here has never disappointed. I've had a variety of things and have come with lots of different people and everyone is always very pleased with the food. On my last visit, I tried the Crispy Cuban Rolls ""snack"" plate as what I thought would be an appetizer, BUT it was more than enough to fill me! Be aware that the portions are proportionally huge (for a snack, it was a pretty big plate; don't even get me started on how humongous the entrees are). The bread of course is also amazing. I had a drink at the bar once and it was also very good. However, I usually have the strawberry lemonade and it is SO good!! If you're a lemonade lover, you will NOT be disappointed. It is very sour and sweet -- it's an absolute ""must"" every time I come here! Service is always absolutely excellent. The restaurant and its restrooms are always very clean as well.

The noise was terrible and the majority of it was coming from the wait staff and kitchen. They were yelling and goofing off. Our waiter screwed up our check so we tried to find him.  After about 15 minutes we flagged down another server. She took off looking for our waiter. Another 10 minutes probably went by before I had to get up and go find her. She was all flustered saying that she couldn't find a manager and that our waiter had an emergency. Finally, a young manthey said was the manager came up to the table and we explained the situation for the fifth time. He was very unprofessional.  He was wearing a necktie around his neck but not around the colored shirt. The collared shirt had two or three buttons undone. Anyway, he finally fixed the check for us and explained that our waiter had been in a fist fight with another employee over a female staff member. All in all we probably spent an additional hour waiting for them to fix their error. It was astounding to me that the manager would let the employees behave in this manner. The kitchen crew was unbearable. They were singing and dancing and yelling and the manager was standing right there. He had no control over his employees at all.

The restaurant was clean and orderly, and the service was good. Our waiter was very attentive. We started off with some cocktails, I ordered the mule, which was awful. A good mule should have a decent amount of ginger flavoring in it, whether it be ginger puree or ginger beer. This drink barely tasted like ginger at all. It tasted like tonic water with some seltzer. I then ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. It is located under the small plates, appetizers section, and boy is it small! The amount of goat cheese given was a joke, and the beets were cut up into tiny little cubes, very disappointing. As my main plate, I had the thai wraps. This was delicious. It is fresh lettuce leaves, cabbage leaves, grilled chicken, cilantro, carrots, bean sprouts, and 3 sauces. You build your own spring roll. Very light but filling. I loved it. The chicken was flavorful, and the peanut sauce and chili sauce were so yummy. I do not recommend ordering this though if on a date, because it is very messy lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-miami?start=40
Rachel S.,"Miami, FL",23,15,1,2.0,1/15/2017,"Disclaimer- never been a huge Cheesecake Factory fan, however this visit was by far one of the worst I've had. My dislike has always come from the value perspective. Way too many dishes that they seem to heighten the prices, but nothing they serve is any better than what I can quickly make at home or get at another casual dining restaurant for 2/3 the price. What sent today's visit downhill was the service. I don't expect to wait over 10 minutes for a server to come to my table, yet I did today. It was then another 10 minutes to get water at the table. Knowing how slow everything was I told the waitress the additional requests when I placed the order (mayo for a burger, parm for the pasta) yet nothing came with the food and again 10 more minutes after, so it was almost useless. Definitely not a place trying to earn my business- go elsewhere with all the options now available at Dadeland! I would have given it one star but the waitress was courteous- I'm assuming they just are given too many tables.

Glad I only ate a quarter of it and noticed. They took it off the bill as I was so irritated as I have not eaten all day and the only thing I ordered came screwed up.  I'm not allergic, thank God.

They walked us over to our table, to find that it was not been whipped down or set. Bread was not offered, turns out that for lunch ""one must request it"".

In all the other places I went to they had the silverware wrapped before giving it to you and never let a plate sit out in the open like that. We had the crab bites-- It was so good it was gone in 1 minute.  My dad had a huggeee bowl of chicken and shirmp gumbo with rice, it cost like 17 dollars so I was hoping the bowl would be huge. He said it was good. I had fried catfish, mashpotatoes, and a tiny bit of green beans... That catfish was the best catfish I have ever tasted, it was SO buttery and soft.

I was not in a good mood going into the restaurant (Miami has a tendency to do that) so I may be a bit biased and jaded in this review. I have been to the CF in Pembroke and have always been pleased.  The service here needs significant help. We pulled up to the bar, and it was hard for the tender to provide any service. I guess she was busy supplying the whole restaurant with drinks so she was unable to take care of us. Our drinks, water and alcoholic, remained empty for the duration of the night. The food was solid, as it mostly is, but the service needs help.  Parking is an absolute joke. It looks like this ""mall"" was built in 1920 when only 10% of the population had access to a motor vehicle. There is no parking anywhere and if you find a spot, consider yourself lucky. We arrived at 5:30 pm and the only available spots were occupied by the racket known as ""valet parking"". Makes me sick.
