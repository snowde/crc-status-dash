Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",994,1007,3062,5.0,1/13/2018,"I know it is chain with a ginormous menu, but I still love Cheesecake Factory. You can always depend on Cheesecake Factory to be the same everywhere and that you will be able to find at least something you like from their huge menu!  I've been coming to this one since it opened, so a lot! I have always had a good time and have experienced good customer service. Sometimes there is a long wait, especially on weekend nights. I try to go earlier or later, or not as busy days/nights. If you do have a wait, at least you can walk around the mall - the buzzers don't work too much past the restaurant, but you can keep an eye on the time. One quick thing, does anyone else feel like their floors are slippery? I'm always scared to wear heels because I feel like I have almost slipped a few times and it isn't from something spilled on the floor, it's weird - maybe they wax the floor a little too much? Their menu is huge and you can pretty much find everything on their. I feel that when restaurants have a large menu, they can't really deliver great food. It is better to limit and serve great items, then mediocre. My go to is the Baja Chicken Tacos, and those are delicious. I was really sad when they stopped serving their chicken pot pie because that was my other fav.  I have to say their shining star is their cheesecake and dessert menu - rightfully so, it is Cheesecake Factory! I love all of the different chocolate cheesecakes and the Black Out Chocolate cake - delicious!! I also love their Lemoncello Cream Torte. Sometimes I need to venture off from my love of chocolate and enjoy the very delicious Lemoncello!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo
Heather B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,20,5,2.0,12/20/2017,"Ordered from them, via Door Dash. Was not as pleased. I hadn't had Cheesecake Factory in years. But, would have expected food to be as good as it used to be.  Unfortunate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo

Chris M.,"San Jacinto, CA",7,61,98,2.0,1/11/2018,"It wasn't a long wait for our party of seven to be seated on a Sunday evening, probably about ten minutes. However, our waitress wasn't very pleasant. Though more importantly our dinners came out separately, about twenty minutes between each one. I've never been to a restaurant where dinners were served separately, quite frustrating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo
Bay M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",186,205,908,4.0,7/19/2017,"Always a good choice. For some reason, this is always the go-to whenever there's a birthday. Not too fancy, but nice enough. The menu is huge, but then again we always go back to our favorites. Food is good as always. Service is always on point (my bad on forgetting our server's name but this gal is so bubbly you can tell she enjoys what she's doing). Ordered their egg roll sampler, their cobb salad, the chicken parmigiana (pizza style - almost like a country fried steak, but topped with an alfredo pasta, see photos, LOL) that was oddly good, the steak with mashed potatoes (good!). Last but not the least... a slice of red velvet cheesecake and a slice of the tiramisu cheesecake - death by sugar but I don't mind once in a while. SO GOOD. But let's talk about that complimentary bread basket, that brown bread though... if I could, I'd probably go to a Cheesecake Factory and just order water and keep eating that brown bread with butter. Forget the entrees and the cheesecake. Give me bread and butter!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo
Kathy G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",216,130,478,4.0,12/23/2017,I had the original strawberry cheesecake here and I enjoyed it! It was the first time I actually savored it.

Charlene L.,"Capistrano Beach, CA",168,91,321,5.0,10/6/2017,"I've decided to start trying chain restaurants to see if they are the same or similar in quality.  Like In & Out Burgers!  They are trained to be worker bees all the same Personalities dedication to work and great. I really only had one bad experience and from that point on I really have enjoyed my meals and the environment overall.  I really appreciate the different kinds of menus. They're over 2 or 3 menus. I love their skinnylicious menu well of course cheesecake menu and their regular gianormous menu. I think it's important to have options for everybody and in your family. Making it a wider selection.  I've Gone to many other cheesecake factory restaurants. The one in La Jolla and San Diego was maybe a 2 overall food and experience. The one in Irvine spectrum was OK, but our server was on spot. I choose to go to Mission Viejo location because I find their food drinks and service to be superior. Today we decided to go have lunch in the mall and of course had lunch at Cheesecake Factory. I ordered off the Skinnylicious menu. My lunch was a turkey avocado sandwich. Served on a round soft bun with turkey tomato and avocado. I ordered onion and it had mayonnaise on it, which I believe was a light version. I put my bacon on the side. The sandwich came with a side salad tossed in a tangy balsamic dressing.  Very enjoyable, great flavors. I  will be ordering that again.  My friend ordered their Crusted Parmesan Chicken dish.  To be honest he gets that all the time.  It's a great meal with 3 or 4 - 1/2 chicken breasts. Pan fried with very light gravy.  Order extra gravy on the side to use on the yummiest mashed potatoes. Also the meal comes with green beans. I prefer my vegetables a little softer if you want them crispy or ask them to be prepared differently.  The chicken is moist and flavorful. Pan seared with parmesan cheese and breading which they have a layer of gravy on the bottom.  Of course he ordered their strawberry lemonade which is dipped in sugar on the rim and always a second one is ordered.   Overall a very pleasant experience. Located perfectly in Mission Viejo mall where you can shop and eat. Our bartender Oscar as always is on his game and is a wonderful bartender and server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo
Megan H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",19,197,347,3.0,11/12/2017,"I ordered from the Cheesecake Factory on Grubhub and chose the Skinnylicious shrimp spring rolls. I was expecting at least 4, but when the food came I opened the box to a measly 2 medium-sized spring rolls. This was my late night dinner and I was disappointed for the amount I paid for. They were delicious, though. The peanut sauce is sooo good. On my most recent visit, I came with friends at 10:30 PM. I guess people like eating late because the restaurant was still bustling at this late hour. We waited 20 minutes to be seated. Our server was lively and friendly and was able to give us each individual checks! I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, Chinese style, from the Skinnylicious menu because the majority of their menu items have a lot of calories. It was yummy-the chicken was tender and it came with my favorite peanut sauce! I was happy with my three tacos for the price I paid. You get free bread, and I am obsessed with that brown oat wheat bread, I don't know why. In general, their menu is pricey. Some slices of cheesecake are almost $10 and unless you order an appetizer as a meal, it's easily $20 per person. I stole some bites of my friends' Oreo and cookie dough cheesecakes and they were quite delicious. Be careful, though, a single slice can set you back 1,000 calories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo

Hana S.,"Front Royal, VA",5,8,7,1.0,10/29/2017,"My boyfriend and I had spent the day searching for steals at Macy's and by 7 o'clock, we were starving. He was craving some fabulous American comfort food, or in his words, ""chicken and mashed taters."" I hadn't been to The Cheesecake Factory since high school, but remembered their large portions and mammoth amount of menu options.  Unfortunately, our dining experience was a tremendous let down from the start. We forgave our very tiny table on the patio, but should have left after the hostess picked up my napkin and shoved it under the table leg in a failed attempt to stabilize our dining experience. We waited for about 20 minutes to be greeted by our server who finally asked if we wanted anything to drink. Another 15 minutes passed before we were blessed with water and bread, but still no cutlery, napkins, or plates.  We finally placed our order (calamari to start, followed by two chicken and mashed potato dishes), and crossed our fingers that our poor waitress was just slammed, and that our food would alleviate our already subpar experience.  After our waitress brought us a second basket of bread, I asked if she had by chance forgotten our appetizer. No, but the kitchen had burnt it. After finally receiving our entrees, we were ready to demolish the mashed taters we had patiently waited for! A few bites in, and my boyfriend fell silent, frowning with horror as he began pulling a very... very long hair from the depths of his throat.  We put our forks down and were ready to leave. However, our waitress was nowhere to be found. We sat for some time...until we finally recruited an alternative server to ask our waitress if she could possibly make an appearance at our table.  Our waitress took my boyfriends plate and left. When she finally came back she asked if I wanted my plate to go. I said no, and she again disappeared somewhere between the labyrinth of sticky tables. Luckily, upon her final return she comped our two entrees. Unfortunately she still left us with the bill for our long awaited drinks and calamari.  To be fair, our waitress was a nice girl. My thoughts are that management assigns too many tables to servers therefore they are are unable to adequately assist each party. I do like The Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location is embarrassingly chaotic and failing all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo
Amber L.,"San Clemente, CA",41,4,,1.0,1/5/2018,"Worst ever.  I got the stuffed chicken tortillas.  The chicken was so dry, it was like jerky.  I basically had some nasty tortilla with petrified chicken.  Some salsa in top didn't help.  Why would anyone serve this??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo

Jennifer C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",5,56,23,3.0,7/30/2017,"Sunday Brunch at Cheesecake Factory was just okay. We were seated quickly but it took awhile to get our food. The waitress let us know that my daughter's fried chicken was burnt and it would be out shortly. The manager came to apologize and I also told him that my omelette was dry and overcooked and I was turned off. My son ordered the French toast which was hands down the best French toast that I've e we had!!!!! The manager was nice and didn't charge us for the omelet or the chicken sandwiches that arrived late. Lindsey, our server was very friendly and welcoming.

Alexis S.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",1,31,28,1.0,11/29/2017,"Such a disappointment!! I usually love coming here but the awful service will definitely keep me away. I work in the mall so it seems convenient to place an order to go, pick it up and go but not this time! For starters, I was on hold for ten minutes just to place the order! I was quoted 20 minutes so of course, I made sure to clock out on break at the perfect time. Once I arrived at the restaurant, I waited almost a total of one hour only for my order to be wrong! So now I have to wait even longer for them to correct my order. Once I had expressed my frustration, the manager came out and said to me, ""I'd make this right but i don't want to keep you on your lunch break any longer"" WHAT!? I spent $40 on cold food and horrible service! I wish the manager was more sincere and accommodating.

Greg C.,"San Clemente, CA",1,20,2,2.0,12/14/2017,"We were seated quickly and drink orders taken. Waitress promised to bring our drinks and some bread and then take our order. Two hangry grandkids were waiting for the bread that didn't come for nearly 30 minutes. I guess they ran out and were waiting for a batch to come out of the oven. Had to wait for the waitress to come back and take our order and then it took a long time to get our food. Some of us got our meals the rest had to wait about 10 minutes. Food was ok, but my daughter had the egg roll appetizers and got sick when she got home. The cheesecake was delicious and my grandson enjoyed it when the staff sang happy birthday. Granted this bad impression was magnified by the hungry impatient youngsters, but overall it was a disappointment. I am not blaming the wait staff, I think it was more of an issue of kitchen management and I could tell the wait staff were stressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo
Miji G.,"West Covina, CA",54,31,24,4.0,10/17/2017,"Even if there are other restaurants at the Shops at Mission Viejo, it's difficult to say no to Cheesecake Factory. They have everything I want, from appetizers to desserts. I just wish I didn't have to tell the server the same thing twice, whether asking for bread or grated parmesan cheese. For lunch, I picked the lunch-sized Bistro Shrimp Pasta, which is officially one of my favorite dishes. The freshness and taste of the mushrooms, tomatoes, and arugula harmonize with the basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce. The symphony of fresh flavors don't end there because the crispy battered shrimps add that wonderful crunch, texture, and shrimp flavor. I'd order this again for sure. For dessert, I got the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cheesecake--layers of their original cheesecake, fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream--and it was the perfect ending to a great meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo

Lola B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,22,1,2.0,11/14/2017,"Food was ok but the worst part was the service. Our server literally had 7-8 tables and was constantly running around. She took our order and then brought us refills, without asking because we were on our last bites with no iced tea and she probably felt bad. But that was pretty much our only interaction with her. No checking on our entrees or asking if we needed anything, which we did. The lady manager just seemed to stand in the back, smiling.

Victoria C.,"Fallbrook, CA",425,240,177,5.0,6/23/2017,"We just went here. There was no wait. Maybe because it was early for dinner. We opted to sit outside on the patio. It was a lovely evening so this was an excellent choice even though you are technically sitting in the mall parking lot. No matter, they still have it laid out nicely. We had appetizers first. They were Tex Mex egg rolls. These were served promptly. Extremely hot ( not just warm like some restaurants serve). Very tasty.   For the main course, we had a Tostada salad and some sort of chicken dinner. The amount of food that arrived could have easily served four. It was excellent. Great service.

Howard A.,"San Clemente, CA",0,15,,2.0,7/11/2017,"Normally, I would rate this restaurant a five. The food is consistently good and the well-trained servers very attentive. My problem has to do with the check. We had lunch there Sunday with friends and we gave the server two credit cards to split the check. I like it when the receipt shows various tip amounts. I automatically used the 22% thinking I was leaving a well-deserved, generous tip. As it turned out, the dollar amount alongside the 22% was based on the entire bill. Therefore, I left a 44% tip! When I realized the mistake, I came back, was able to change the tip amount and spoke to the manager. He was not very interested in this issue....which I would call a SCAM.

Stephen W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",192,134,169,4.0,1/27/2017,"It was very busy this Friday night and took about 25 minutes to get seated.  The bread was nice and warm and fresh. I started out with the loaded baked potato tots, which were great. They are deep friend with cheese, bacon, and chives baked in with the potato. I also had the chicken potstickers which are always good.  For my main dish, I had a chicken Parmesan sandwich with a side Caesar salad. I asked for extra croutons but there were still very few croutons on the salad. The lettuce also was a bit dry because they were a little stingy on the Caesar dressing. The sandwich was very good, but I think they may have changed the tomato sauce that comes on the side for dipping with the sandwich, and the old sauce was better (or this was a bad batch of the same sauce).  Then for dessert I had the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake which is definitely my favorite. It is so rich and sugary Overall I would definitely come back to this Cheesecake Factory!

Laura Q.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,17,3,4.0,10/6/2017,"I ordered tonight through deal Dash. And I have to admit that Cheesecake Factory is my guilty pleasure. Usually all is well. I've liked most of what I've ordered but encountered a few fails too along the way. Tonight I got a chicken quesadilla. I've attached a picture of it looking forelorn all by its little lonesome in the plastic box it came in. No garnish at all. Where is the guacamole, sour cream and salsa? It's good but those garnishes are not in the quesadilla, I checked even though I knew they should have been on the side. Fail! Someone put the lid on the container and I'm thinking how the heck did you NOT see that? No, really. How? I got the chicken taquitos too and those were good. Really good. And I got the lemon raspberry cheesecake, which, though I was tempted to just start with that, I haven't but I'm sure it will be, as always, delicious. I'd requested bread and butter as I always do, and in probably 5 orders now, I've gotten it maybe 1-2 times. Not a huge deal as clearly I keep ordering from there.  This is the first time I've written a review for this restaurant. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but the key lime, lemon meringue and lemon raspberry are all delicious and are responsible for me thinking a little differently about cheesecake. I got the Oreo extreme last time and did not care for that at all. But enough about cheesecake. Some other things I've ordered. Chicken samosas. Not good. In fact, really bad. They were actually tasteless. Keep the taquitos, lose the samosas. Crab and artichoke dip, chicken lettuce wraps, zuchinni and steak tacos were all ok but nothing that I got really excited about and likely will not order them again. The avocado egg rolls though...YUM! Tonight is the first time I have not ordered them. They are delicious and I love the dipping sauce. I know I've had the Vietnamese Spring Rolls when I've dined at the restaurant and as I recall they look good and sound good but are a bit of a letdown. I keep toying with ordering them but haven't in a long while. The thing is while I recall not being excited and maybe a bit disappointed in the actual taste, I cannot remember what exactly it was that didn't do it for me. I'm sure I'll eventually order them again and hopefully I'll enjoy them more this time around because they really do sound good on the menu. I'll continue coming back even if it's for nothing more than the avocado egg rolls and lemon raspberry cheesecake. It really doesn't get better than that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=20

I take it and I get home. Realize that she gave me a very small box with only 2 tiny chicken pieces, 1 shrimp and just the bottom with some rice. Where the hell did the rest of my food go?! I paid a total of $28 for this dinner/ service! Did you guys throw out the rest? Did you run out of larger boxes?

The wait staff is pleasant and responsive. The big issue seems to be the wait times. Although we put our order in the very moment the server came to the table for the first time to take a drink order, we still waited over 49 minutes and drank two full large glasses of iced tea.  It appears that they do not staff to the demand. The servers seem to do the best they can, but if management is not staffing adequately it means the wait for a table is twice as long as they estimate because servers cannot take orders quickly enough.  I did not see anyone bussing tables and heard servers apologizing often for the wait times.  It is good that they acknowledge it, but an estimate of 20-25 minutes to wait to be seated was actually 48 minutes, then it took another 8 minutes after we gave them the buzzer to get to a person to walk us to the table and another 25 minutes before the server arrived at the table plus the 49 minutes after the order for food to arrive. A bit more thoughtful staffing would result in a better guest experience.  Clearly it is still a good experience evidenced by all the people willing to wait two hours to have dinner. Try the bang bang chicken and shrimp or the miso salmon which are both excellent.  Plan around the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=20
Maggie B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,44,1,3.0,5/15/2017,"We went here for Mother's Day yesterday and it wasn't great and wasn't bad. As to be expected, there were long lines and the wait for a table was about 45 minutes. After ordering, however, the wait for the food was an additional 50 minutes.  We did get bread, and when we asked for extra, it took awhile too. Our waiter kept coming by and saying something like ""right! Your bread"" or ""it's coming up let me go check"" about 3 or 4 times. I don't know, I just figured they would keep pumping out bread baskets. We asked for the heater to be turned on (we were on the patio) and the waiter said ""sure thing!"" Left and promptly forgot. We asked again 20 minutes later and he apologized and switched it on. He was a really nice guy, but they seemed short staffed for the crowd that was there.  The manager did come by to apologize for the wait but it was half hearted and made it sound like a chore.  Everyone liked the food, except me. The nachos i ordered has this weird cheese sauce on them that had an awful texture and strange taste. I expected just regular melted cheese.. I thought about sending them back but didn't want to wait another half hour for something new. I think we'll stick to the Huntington Beach location from now on.

We were immediately greeted by our server, who was super friendly and brought out bread and poured water many times. My friend and I split the farefalle chicken pasta. The portion sizes are huge~ So I recommend splitting with a friend. The sauce was super creamy and garlicky! Love me some garlic and mushrooms~ I was too full to have cheesecake, but my favorite is the 30th anniversary. Super chocolatey and not too sweet compared to the other ones.

When I finally got my food my fries was cold so I told my waiter very nice guy he apologized and got me a fresh fries. When I started eating my burger that I ordered Medume well it was Medume rare. I quietly told him about it and showed it to him, and I even told him it's not a big deal just want it to tell him. Did not ask for the manager nor asked for them onto comp it. He offered to have the manager come by and talk to me. I even told him they don't have too. The manager (she) did not even stop by to apologize. I did not eat half of my food and she had asked the waiter if I ate my food just to give a cheesecake. What a management she should not work there is she does not have time to stop by just to say sorry for what happened.

Sometimes you go in and there's no line, and half the tables are empty, so you get served promptly. Other times, you go in, there's a terrible line (not surprising for Cheesecake Factory), terrible service because the kitchen/bakery are slammed, and/or the server is inexperienced/just bad at their job. It's almost like I need to write a separate review for each time I visit this location. For this review, I'm just going to leave this gem of a photo, and a brief description. This is the kids dessert strawberry platter. It's $4. For 4 strawberries that were past their prime, and a sad little plop of cream. After tax and tip, that's $5.11. That is beyond highway robbery, it's basically a slap in the face.

I order the same thing every time I place a curbside pick up order. It's even written on the receipt as to what I ordered. Tonight's order took 36 minutes ticket time when I was quoted 20-25. When I tried to pay, the bakery Togo girl said my gift certificate that my sister purchased for me for Christmas that had a balance on it was quote ""a zero balance"". To which I then had to get out of my car which is parked curbside and go in to talk to a manager. I went on to the cheesecake gift card balance website to which I indeed have a balance. The manager fixed the payment issue. But when I got to finally eat my meal, it was not prepared as to my order. There was not 3 extra sides of sauce or the napkins & utensils to eat the food as noted by the server who took the order and wrote on my ticket. Pictures to show what I received compared to what my ticket order said.  Bottom line, line location has failed me on the same order curbside 9 out of 10 times.

Dm C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",4,164,19,1.0,7/28/2017,"4th times a charm? It's an epidemic at this place. Slow service, mediocre food, they remain busy because of the name- not quality. Again sat there too long before someone approached- tho the water and bread came fairly quicker than usual after that my tiny appetizer salad took 35 minutes.  I decided to look at my phone when I ordered and when I received the salad 35 minutes.  The Beet and goat cheese salad always tastes dirty like I'm eating it straight from the dirt. Do they wash the lettuce and beets? Why the gravel in the teeth- what's gravely? The management are dressed like they just don't care and are seeming burnt out no pizazz or joy listless, so I see where it's trickling down from. I forgot to add this is the 5th time, forgot to report of yet another time two weeks ago I sat down at the bar and waited as the brunette bartender guy didn't give me the time of day for way way way too long it was so uncomfortable- I was embarrassed that as a single woman in my 50's to sit at a bar hoping to grab happy hour meal and drink and I sat there like a dope for an uncomfortable amount of time when he wasn't doing anything!  I left. I've given this location three times, well three strikes and you're out. I'll stick to my last visit... Got sat on pretty quick- I immediately told the host that I knew what I wanted no  need for me to look at menu--and no waiter in-site for 20 minutes. Finally Mr. Cool comes over and says he'll be with me. Another 10 minutes go by and the bread came from a bus boy. I got up and found my waiter and told him I just wanted a small plate.

One of the reasons I don't like it is because they don't take reservations and the wait is typically long during lunch and dinner... at least it is whenever I walk by it while I'm at the mall.  It's also very loud inside. They certainly have a large menu with lots of choices, including lots of different cheesecakes!  On this particular visit, I got the Chicken Madeira and I asked for linguine instead of the other pasta it normally comes with.  The plate was HUGE!  I made 3 meals out of it (not kidding).  The flavor/taste was good, the chicken was big and they gave lots of mushrooms and sauce, so no problems there! The service (waitress) was also friendly and efficient.  Drinks were refilled and she came around often to check on us.

Lauren H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",26,43,2,2.0,8/16/2017,"Ate in the bar area last night. Walked in and wasn't greeted by the hostess, she was preoccupied. I finally asked her if I could sit in the bar area. She told me that the bar and high tops are first come, first serve. I asked her about the regular seats in the bar area, she said I'd have to put my name in (this was after 9pm). I asked her if I could put my name in for the regular bar tables. She seemed slightly frazzled and told me that she'd be right with me, she said this just as another hostess walked up. The second hostess asked if she could help me. I told her that I'd like to wait for a regular table in the bar area. She told me that that section was now closed, and that they weren't seating any more parties there because there isn't a server assigned to that section anymore, even though there were people sitting there with menus. Fair enough. I used to work in restaurants in college so I know the drill. I took a seat in a high top in the bar area. It was almost 10 minutes before I was greeted and given a menu. The couple in the high top next to me had several questions about the menu, and then when the bartender placed their order, they needed it modified because they forgot to mention no tomatoes in the salad. This made a frazzled bartender even more scurried and frazzled. He had to go back to the kitchen and tell the cooks. The couple next to me wanted to read a menu again even though they had already placed an order (I get it, they were being slightly high maintenance) that's when I finally got a menu. I eventually had my order taken. I wanted the Santa Fe salad but without chicken. I asked the bartender if I would still get charged full price even though I didn't want the chicken. Without even asking his manager, he told me ""yes."" Fair enough. I was just hungry and tired of waiting at this point. Both of the bartenders were older men, and they both scurried around the whole bar area all night, very frazzled, speed walking, etc, and the well nor bar were slammed. Two high tops down from me a woman even complained to one of the bartenders. I could hear her say something about ""adderal"" which I believe is a Rx drug to treat ADD. The whole vibe was just awkward. Then the other bartender zoomed past me not once, but twice, and didn't hear me when I shouted ""excuse me!"" Because my cup of water had been empty for more than 5 minutes, which is an eternity while you're eating. The couple next to me heard me try to get the bartender's attention to no avail, and the husband shouted ""Eric!"" On my behalf To get the guy's attention. Again, the bar area was not that busy at all. 3 high tops were occupied and there were two patrons sitting at the bar. Tickets printing in the well were scarce, so it's not like they were slammed. I've sat in the bar area several times in the past, and usually there's younger guys working, and it's like a well oiled machine. Young or old, I don't care. I just want decent service and to be checked on once in awhile. But watching these guys zoom around frantically the whole time made me anxious. Again, there were other tables complaining too, so I'm not just exaggerating. It was uncomfortable. The next time I sit in the bar I'll check to see who's working first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=100

Bobbi B.,"Las Vegas, NV",3258,235,536,4.0,1/22/2016,"I've eaten at this location for many years and the one thing I can say is that The Cheesecake Factory is pretty consistent. Even from location to location, the food tastes pretty much the same. I've never ordered anything that I hated or had any experience stick out in my head as being unpleasant. The service at this location is always excellent. Pretty much everything I've tried on their menu has been good. Their bread is addicting but keep it away from me. I'm partial to the dark brown loaf and I could eat tons of it if given the opportunity. That's why I don't even let them bring it. I know myself too well! A few personal favorites are the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Fire Roasted Artichoke for appetizers... Spicy Cashew Chicken on Spaghettini instead of rice, or their Cobb Salad for entrees. They had a really amazing Pineapple Jalapeño cocktail on their menu that got the axe recently. That sort of pissed me off but hey, what can you do?  The menu can be a bit overwhelming but as the saying goes, ""variety is the spice of life"". If you subscribe to that theory, I have a feeling that you will like The Cheesecake Factory. THE BEST cheesecake EVER is their Godiva Cheesecake. It's truly heavenly. Last meal on earth, I'm ordering that for dessert.

We had to ask for bread twice and she didn't ask if we wanted coffee with our dessert. That would have been an easy boost to her tip but she didn't ask and we didn't order.

Kristin Leigh M.,"Las Flores, CA",701,1127,1789,5.0,1/4/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory for its variety (though I usually order one of two things). Particularly, I like the Mission Viejo location. It is considerably less crowded than the nearby location at The Spectrum. Sure, you'll still have to wait a bit on a busy night - but 10 - 15 minutes is much better than 50+. Service has always been top notch here (and at any Cheesecake Factory). Last time we dined at this location, the server forgot to put our order in, but was very remorseful, and apologized profusely.  If you're struggling to find something to eat in the novel of a menu, I recommend the crusted chicken romano or the chinese chicken salad. Crusted chicken romano, if you're in a hungry mood or the salad if you're feeling healthy. If you get the salad, I recommend you get the noodle straws on the side (they are a bit overbearing) and the dressing on the side, too, as sometimes they can douse it. I love the complimentary bread that they serve; I could LIVE off of it! If you're looking for cheesecake (which I actually don't eat), my husband adores the cookie dough one.

Jeff K.,"San Clemente, CA",482,248,621,4.0,12/28/2015,"It's always good.. expect a wait! So I've been coming to MV location for years. It's consistently great for brunch, lunch  or dinner. You'll should expect a wait as they are always busy. But keep in mind, if you see a tall table open in the bar you can order dinner from there as well. LOCATION & AMBIANCE (Rating 3.75) The location is a bit hidden, but if you're been to the mall a few times it's not hard to find and there's valet parking right next to the door. The interior is large (as most Cheesecake factories are) and well appointed. It's a bit noisy so it's not easy to carry on a conversation with people that aren't sitting close to you but depending on where you sit it can be quieter.  The patio is actually pretty nice and well heated as well.  SERVICE (Rating 4.25) Their servers are always well trained and do a pretty good job. From time to time they'll be a bit busy so they can get overwhelmed and a bit harder to find your specific server but there always seems to be 5-6 others running around that are happy to help. SUNDAY BRUNCH ITEMS ============================= CALIFORNIA OMELETTE (Rating 4.25)  So this thing is big! It comes with avocado, mushrooms, green onion, tomato, garlic, shallots, jack & cheddar cheeses and sour cream. The only thing missing is ham. So I usually fix that by having it added. Their potatoes are always good, but sometimes (like today) get a bit over-cooked. The sour dough bread is amazing as is most of the breads they serve. CARAMEL ROYAL MACCHIATO (Rating 3.75) This thing is typically just a little to sweet for me and it usually isn't very hot due to the amount of cream put into it. It's a double espresso, hot caramel, vanilla and steamed milk. It's super tasty and I sometimes will just add some coffee to it to make it less sweet and hotter. They should really pay more attention to the temperature these come out at IMO though and my rating would have increased.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=80

We weren't very hungry to begin with, but finished every bite due to its deliciousness. We were constantly checked up on, asked how our food was and if there was anything else we needed.

Fettuccini Alfredo also very creamy but sometimes the sauce is a bit too dry. The original cheesecake itself is alright but it isn't anything to be amazed by.

I was a huge fan of a burger that I no longer have on the menu but have all the things to make it. I was advised that the cost with double to have them add coleslaw to a burger.

K B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",42,61,71,2.0,9/8/2015,"Usually we have good experiences here, especially with the wait staff, but I had to say something about our last visit. We just dined here about 5:30 Monday night, Labor Day. While service was with a smile, there was obvious poor planning by management for a holiday and it needs to be addressed.  Extra staffing was desperately needed. The hostesses didn't seem to know what they were doing (don't train during the dinner rush), our waiter was managing eight tables and running around like crazy, and he was double seated twice. While the table next to us got their order in, it was another half hour before our order was taken and another half hour for the food. Then our waiter disappeared for a good 15 minutes. By the time he got back, we were ready to leave and waited another fifteen minutes for our check to be paid.  On our way out, we picked up a slice of cheesecake, which was another flawed process. There was ONE girl and a random guy in and out, taking the orders and also filling them for the entire restaurant. My husband stood there for another ten minutes just waiting for a piece of cheesecake sitting right in front of us. We thought ordering at the counter would expedite the process of getting it since the waiter kept going MIA but there was just no getting around the long wait.  This was a NIGHTMARE considering we had our 3 month old with us. She is an excellent baby, which is why we take her everywhere, no problem. But when dining out takes over two hours due to understaffing, and the table you shun is the one with the baby, you're asking for a problem. Management needs to plan better coverage for holidays! Maybe you'd have happier wait staff if they had a fair balance of tables. It felt like the regular Monday staff wasn't supported with any extra holiday help, and the restaurant suffered because of this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=160

Emma M.,"Stafford, VA",0,4,1,3.0,1/14/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but this definitely isn't my favorite location. I've had one or two problems before, but usually I let things go. I'm a college waitress so I know Friday nights can be busy, but I was in tonight with my cousin and we were sat at an awkward location. Her seat was where two benches connected, I swapped seats with her and realized right away it was quite uncomfortable. Hadn't even taken off my jacket and popped back over and caught the (manager ?) an older gentlemen who sat us and asked to be moved. He said nothing else was available. And looked too busy to talk to us. I get it was busy, we waited 45 minutes, was told it would be 30 (went back up and the were told it was actually 30-40, totally fine). So busy, is cool, but if you don't have a second to care maybe point out someone who works there who might care. I just felt that if I didn't look like some ditsy college girl, than he would have maybe taken a second to ask me why. A simple ""Is there a problem with your table."" He didn't, didn't attempt to fix it, or see if he could move the benches so the were even (still would be awkward). I would have let this go if it weren't for the fact there was a booth across from us and a 2 top in our row open when we were sat, so I just felt like there were options. When I went back to sit down it was another couple minutes before both tables were filled. Then when I sat back down the women at the table next to me laughed and said the gentlemen before me had complained of feeling squished next to the pole and other one was uncomfortable in the bench seat. So maybe it had nothing to do with my gender, but either way, maybe not the best place to have a table. My wait wasn't worth sitting there, it was distracting. This location is the meeting point 1/2 way between my school and home so I pop into this location with my parents and always have felt I get better service with them. Whether it was because I was some girl or young, I just hate that I only get this feeling from this location. I tip 20% plus every time, I try to be polite to the busy hosts, and I'm just a customer who loves her cheesecake and comes in almost every week, but don't always feel welcomed by staff.

Finally, when we were tired of eating of eating the bread, I let the waitress know that it's been an hour and asked if we could just cancel our meals now because everyone was tired of waiting. She said she'd check on the food again, and it finally did come out, but I honestly expected the manager to come apologize or at least acknowledge that it wasn't ok for us to have to wait that long.

However my friend and I were shopping and taking these two factors into account, we decided to put our name down a little early. When she handed us the buzzer, I politely asked her, ""If I go to Nordstrom, will this still buzz?"". She completely ignored me and talked to her co-worker. Okay, I thought, it is loud in here. So I repeated my question. The co-worker heard me but walked away quickly while the short bob-lady still did not acknowledge me. I finally said with a firm voice, ""EXCUSE ME"" and then proceeded with my question. She finally heard me and said, ""Nope"", just like that. Not only did she briefly answer my question, she did so with an attitude that made me feel far superior than herself. Sorry I am not familiar with your pager system, lady.  We were sat outside and our server seemed to rush us. I never caught her name because I was using the restroom when she took our drinks, but she made me feel extremely rushed to put all of our orders in. I understand you want to flip tables and make x amount of tips, however that is no reason to treat customers with a rushed feeling. She was so rude to us at the end when we asked to split the bill (before she even brought the checks out) and I over it really quick. Food: 1 star I usually order the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps (super awesome and delicious), however I decided to go outside of my comfort zone and try something different. I ordered the Club Sandwich and it was very dry and bland. I could have had a better sandwich at Subway or Togo's for far less. Ambiance: 3 stars I don't mind this location because it is in a mall and they seem to keep it quite nice in here. It is super clean however the bathroom was really tiny and messy. I know it is Friday night and graduation night, however it seems that a large corporation like this would have a sufficient staff to keep things nice and tidy on occasions like this.  Overall, I probably would not visit this location again. I would much rather drive the extra 15 mins to the Irvine Spectrum location and enjoy a nice meal there. I have never had a bad experience there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=140

This location is part of the Mission Viejo mall, and as such is frequented by many mallgoers including myself. If you go there any day after 5:30pm for dinner, expect that there will likely be a wait to get a table. Plan accordingly or go earlier. There isn't much sitting space either for the wait, so you might have to stand if there are a lot of people in front of you. Luckily it's at a mall, so you can shop while you wait as long as someone stays within range of the radio device.  The waiters and waitresses are all friendly that we have had and most of the time the food comes out quick.

Anyway, the hostess was pleasant, service was good, my food was good but my daughter found a black hair in hers.... after she had eaten about 1/4 of it. She was getting ready to cut into the chicken when she saw something dark.... moved a pasta noodle and saw the black hair covered in sauce attached to the chicken. I pushed the hair to the side of the bowl, showed the waiter and asked if we could just give this dish back. He took the plate, a manager came out within minutes, apologized to both my daughter and I.... he asked her if he could get her another one or fix her something else to eat but she declined. He apologized again and had the dish removed from our bill. Yes it was gross, but it happens. The kitchen staff is only human and these things sometimes happen. We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go.... I was hopeful that since my daughter didn't have her food replaced that they would comp our dessert but they didn't. Perhaps that was just being stingy on my end. I'm giving The Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because they have one of my favorite pasta dishes and overall I do enjoy coming here.

The manager came and I showed him the utensils and he did not seem to even care and just said will get u new set. We received the new set same thing dirty. So we asked the server to either give us a hot towel or take time and wash it and she did wash it. She then brought the salad and again was very disappointed.

Melissa K.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",348,211,1286,4.0,2/20/2014,"I frequently visit the Cheesecake Factory for dinner, but this was the first time I actually went for breakfast. To my surprise their breakfast items were very good. Not only well presented but also very delicious.  Our server was very attentive and frequently visited our table although the restaurant was very busy. Although tempting I was able to abstain from ordering a cheese cake for dessert as their cheese cake is to die for. My favorite is the simple cheesecake with strawberry sauce on it. Delicious rich and absolutely decadent. The menu as cheesecake is very diverse and robust. I recommend their breakfast items for anyone that is traveling to the mall for a shopping spree.  All of their dinner items are great, but the must have is obviously their huge selection of cheesecake. Please do not go into a Cheesecake Factory restaurant without ordering their cheesecake.

Joy G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",128,121,110,2.0,1/9/2015,"Awesome food, great wait staff...horrible front of the house staff. Cheesecake Factory, you oughta do something about your reservation and seating process because waiting over an hour when we can make a reservation is ridiculous.  Why don't they take reservations?  Uh, because it makes sense? Front staff review:  AWFUL!  Granted we came on a super busy evening, New Year's Eve, at 5:30 to get a head start on dinner and the crowd, and it was already a madhouse.  We spoke with the girl in front (short brown hair, sour face, looks like she hates life and everyone alive) and my husband put his name down for 4.  She rudely tells him ""It's going to be an hour, do you still want to wait?""  She pretty much implied that we need to leave!  My husband was a bit astonished with what she said and told her ""Uh yeah, we're hungry...?"" She retorted with ""It's STILL an hour."" and unceremoniously waved us off and called the next group behind us.   After waiting an excruciating hour, our buzzer finally went off and we went to the front table, handed the buzzer to the sour girl...and she just kept looking down and didn't even acknowledge us at all.  We stood there staring at her, waiting for her to look up but NOTHING.  She's a freaking mute or perhaps a robot.  All the other hostesses were busy but were actually assisting people to their tables!  Not this chick.  After standing for another two minutes, my husband finally pounded the table to get her attention; ""HEY!  We've been standing here..how long after we've been waiting for an hour do we have to wait again after our buzzer went off???""  She looked up and GLARED at him!  I felt like giving her a piece of my mind but she wouldn't like it.  She grabbed the menus and shoved them into the hands of another hostess  She didn't even say anything, man she really hates her job.  Sour girl with short brown hair..get a job as a PRISON WARDEN.  You're not cutting it as a restaurant hostess, not even close. Now to why we keep coming back:  the wait staff and the awesome grub!  Our waiter was an older gentleman by the bar area.  He profusely apologized for the long wait and wanted to get things started for us right away.  He was already laying down the bread basket as we were seating our son on the high chair.  My husband exclaimed ""I NEED A BEER, STAT!!!"" And he was on it like a bonnet.. Cheesecake Factory's menu changes constantly so it's hard for me to pin down a favorite, but so far everything they have is so delicious!  That evening, we ordered calamari, jambalaya pasta, chicken madeira, pepperoni pizza, a hibiscus martini and two beers.  Of course, you cannot go to Cheesecake Factory without ordering cheesecake! The Godiva cheesecake is so rich I could only eat a few bites at a time and I always save the rest and still have desert for at least after two meals!  My husband loves anything with peanut butter and my daughter ordered the strawberry.  So good!  Worth the $150 we spent that evening. With that said, I think Cheesecake Factory should re-train their front staff and re-evaluate their reservation process.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=180

Jessica L.,"Irvine, CA",0,23,11,4.0,6/28/2014,"I really like this place. The service is good...nothing special about it but it was good. The food is really nice! My personal favorite is the miso salmon with brown rice and broccoli (instead of snow peas). I get it every time I go! The salmon is so soft and moist. The sauces (one brown one white) are delicious together with the salmon. There's a nice little top of green onions which I personally can't to without. And all this is on top of some white or brown rice. I usually go for the brown rice for the nice texture difference it adds to the dish. If you don't have enough sauce, ask for more! It's such a delicious dish if you like cooked salmon! A must have! The scenery looked really nice too. There are pretty painted designs on the arches and ceiling that are nice to look at.  I just really hate how crowded this place gets sometimes. It's a popular place which makes me want to avoid it during eating time. Oh well. It can't be helped.

I ordered their catfish plate, and it seemed as if the fish was overcooked, making the crust a little dark and crunchier than it should have been; same with my boyfriend's fried shrimp. I had a card for a free slice of cheesecake, and boy, have the slices gotten way smaller than what they use to be.

Nick S.,"Dana Point, CA",4,15,4,2.0,3/22/2013,"This review is mostly to serve as a heads up to management who may be reading. On Saturday the 16th I went to The Cheesecake Factory with my wife, our 2 year-old son and 2 other people. Things started out great. We were seated quickly, the server was a friendly young man who gave us quick and courteous service. He brought my son a child-style cup with water in it, as well as making his meal into the child version (even though we hadn't asked for it, or known about that option). So far so good. We ordered some appetizers before the main course. Ours came out, but there was some issue with our friends' app (we were told it was made wrong at first but then someone else said it was sent to the wrong table...weird). We waited patiently. The appetizer came out in about 10 minutes, and it WAS delicious. At this point, though, I personally would have expected the main course to have come out pretty soon after that, considering this last appetizer was late and we'd finished ours (plus we have a toddler, and ANY server worth his/her salt knows that parents don't want to entertain kids in a restaurant for any longer than necessary). So we waited. And waited. We were offered more bread at one point, which felt like the server KNEW things were taking too long. Bread AFTER the first round AND appetizers. For me, it took long enough that I felt like we should have been leaving, and not getting a main course. It just felt awkward...like we'd been through all the steps, except we hadn't. I had originally considered dessert but I didn't even really want to be there anymore. I ended up leaving with my son, and taking him to the play area, while the others finished up. He was tired of sitting (and honestly so was I). The food arrived as I was getting up, but at that point I was just over it. If I'd stayed I would have asked for some sort of discount or something. I'm not typically that guy but it just wasn't a smooth experience. You know those when you feel them. This was one of them. When I finally got to eat my chicken caesar salad later that night, it WAS good. But the in-restaurant experience left much to be desired with all the waiting, the two different stories about the appetizer, no acknowledgment or apology that things were taking quite long and the general feeling that we'd been forgotten about . If there's a next time maybe I'll get to try some cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=260

Laina A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",486,696,935,3.0,8/13/2012,"It was scorching hot at The Shops at Mission Viejo, think over 90's outside.  When asked by the host at Cheesecake Factory if we wanted to sit outside, I gave him a look of are you kidding? But apparently there were others that enjoyed baking and roasting, but I was not one of them.  I prefer the Irvine Spectrum location, don't know why ... just do. I tried a new item, one of the burgers and it was ok-fine, but not really for the price.  When paying $10 and up for a burger, I expect a lot more.  I also do not like the overly dark golden brown crispy fries. I saw nobody in my small group ranting over their food, in fact one barely ate.  Luckily, service was awesome and our waiter was quick on the iced tea refills, including getting all who wanted a to go cup of iced tea, so he was definitely rewarded with a great tip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=260

So much of the rating is based upon the decor, the menu, the 'business model' if you will... and since the Cheesecake Factory is so standardized, you've been to one, you've been to 'em all. That being said, there's some damned good stuff on the menu! Tex-mex egggrolls are badass. The Louisiana chicken pasta is amazing. The Bistro Shrimp pasta is perhaps even better. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is a homerun. I STILL miss the Shrimp Po' Boy and wish they'd bring it back. Nothing left to review it on except service.

Jason M.,"Lake Forest, CA",4,18,2,2.0,1/8/2014,"My wife and I just celebrated our 8 year anniversary and decided to go to the Cheescase Factory for dinner. I know that it is not the most elegant location for an anniversary dinner, but we wanted to go somewhere that held a special place in our relationship, and ironically, all those elegant restaurants that did have a special place in our relationship have all gone out of business. Having just returned that day from vacation with my family, we felt the Cheesecake Factory would suffice, until the staff ruined our customer experience. This is a place I take my family on a regular basis, but this particular location struggles with service.  Tonight was the perfect example of why I intend not to return to this particular Cheesecake Factory. The experience began by sitting at the booth for 11 minutes before we were ever greeted by anyone. And that initial greeting was a bus boy dropping off some bread at the table without even uttering a word and then running off to the next task. More than 5 additional minutes passed before our waiter introduced himself. At that time we placed our order which included waters with lemon. He returns with the water but of course no lemon - not a huge deal but certainly the first clue that our waiter was not listening to us. And he dropped them off so fast that we did not have an opportunity to even ask for straws. I found it odd that straws were not automatically included, and they expected us to drink from the big mugs that they serve. When he finally returned, and we asked for straws, he said it no longer their policy to automatically include straws in the drinks, and that we would have to go find some. After he finally returned with straws, and my son's strawberry lemonade, we placed our order - this took almost 25 minutes from the time we sat down! When our order arrived, both my son's and wife's orders were wrong, but we were so annoyed by the service and time it took to get food, that we simply accepted it.  What put me over the top and inspired me to write this review was when my son had finished his strawberry lemonade, the waiter asked if he wanted another one, and we told him that a glass of water would be fine - instead of returned with a water glass, the waiter poured water into his strawberry lemonade glass!  There are other Cheesecake Factories in South OC, avoid this one because their standards, service, and obviously management is extremely sub-par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=240

I ordered on the phone and the lady fought me on the fact they don't have a ""secret sauce"" when in fact they do. Its on their menu. Her response was ""we definitely don't have a secret sauce"" in a rude tone. I then asked for thousand island and she put me on hold to check about the secret sauce and I already was moved past that and asked for thousand island. She then comes back after I was put on hold again just to tell me they do have a secret sauce. So I told her I would just take thousand island like I requested earlier. I asked to speak to a manager and she said in a rude tone ""I am a manager."" Wow cheesecake factory, I thought you hired good quality workers not low class rude ones. I also was told pick up would be at 8:30 (20 minutes) i waited a total of 45 minutes for my food and i already gave my payment!!

Also, after waiting 55 min for a table to be set on a Friday afternoon, it would be nice not to be seated in some stranger's lap.

Akiko I.,"Orange County, CA",1461,1443,13972,3.0,7/15/2013,"- Locale Destination -  It's on Marguerite Pkwy and Shops Blvd in Mission Viejo.  It's in the ""The Shops at Mission Viejo"" - shopping mall. They open till 11pm, which is later than other places in the mall! Decor is like any other Cheesecake Factory. Little dim, heavy and rich decor. Bar and counter for cheesecakes. Lots of seating. Prompt service, but not so considerate enough to warn me about the ridiculous portion sizes..  - Gluttony Expedition -  It comes with lots of breads (free).. The food was so big already and do you still need breads??? Lots of gym time even if you had a high metabolism...  Crusted chicken with basil spaghetti: The chicken was breaded and deep fried. Well cooked (big 2pieces). Pasta was lightly seasoned with pesto sauce. Good dish! So big - it's good for 2 adults! Santa Fe salad: It was gigantic - literally a BOWL of salad. I could barely finish the half. Corn, black beans, chicken, and decent dressing with LOTS of crunchy string chips. Not bad.  - Conqueror's Deduction -  I had a cheese cake before at Cheesecake Factory, but never eaten the meal here. Foods were unexpectedly not bad for the big chain restaurants (though I'm not a fan of those chains). It was a lot better than PF Chang or Denny's for sure. I wondered why they always had a long line.. Now I know!  But the ridiculously huge portion is definitely helping this ""obesity"" nation. I wondered why they had ""half salad"" on the menu... I didn't think ""Regular"" size salad was an enormous BOWL of salad. Great to share, but the server should have mentioned it when she saw me I wasn't a gigantic person. I've never come to eat here and didn't know about this crazy portion.... Pasta dish was for 2 people, too. Entrees are like $14 to mid $20. You have no problem sharing one plate with 2 adults. These ""popular for people in general"" restaurants should be more concerned about the healthy diet. One order doesn't need to be ""TWO ADULT"" size. If the size were intended for one person, it is as bad as ""McDonald's"" diet..  I use a ""doggy bag"" but am not a fan of it. I don't wanna eat ""left over"" meal because the taste quality would totally sink compared with the ""fresh"" one. They should cut the portion and price so that we can avoid using a ""doggy bag"" and control the amount of intake.   I don't mind coming back here to eat, but I'll share the dish definitely!

Monica D.,"Orange County, CA",751,678,46,4.0,5/27/2012,"I really can't complain about Cheesecake Factory. Can anyone? I mean, sure their menus of both entirely-too-largely-portioned mega meals and sinfully delicious but similar-tasting-looking-and-sounding cheesecakes haven't actually changed in decades, but... it works, so, eh? I've definitely fallen in love with the caramel chicken. It's so bad for you I'm sure even breaking it up into two meals will still do some numerical damage to your body and maybe a bit to your pocketbook. But! It's so so SOOOO so good. The bf can't stand the mac 'n' cheese burger though, so I suppose if anything Cheesecake's more polarizing than your average cookie cutter chain restaurant. The one thing that has always made this particular branch stand out, however, has been the service. On Mother's Day, when I'm sure all service workers would like to do is generally punch every single celebrant's family members in the face, we were treated so kindly and patiently. Bread, drinks, silverware, napkins, food, sides, to-go boxes, checks, everything so efficient and top notch. Kudos to the servers and their managers at this Cheesecake.

T O.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",71,173,18,2.0,5/19/2012,"First off, I've been a fan of Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years.  However, this location i subpar. For starters, the hostess lost us in que, several parties that arrived after us were seated first, and finally one of her coworkers walked over to me and whispered, ""What's your name?"" then walk back over to the hostess and told her my name.  Just poor.  Then it took another several minutes to get seated...no apology.  I guess the high school staff is not trained on manners nor customer service, just cover your ass. Was seated on the patio outside. It was a nice warm night so great idea.  Only problem: the walkway between tables is not even shoulder-wide for workers to walk by.  Result: nearly every worker AND customer walking by my table bumped me when walking by -- not pleasant.  It got a little chilly so my wife asked to turn on the heater above, and apparently they are either on off position or wide open at full blast, nothing in between. A few minutes later a large party was seated at the table next to us.  They added more chairs around their table so now there's NO room for people to walk between our tables...even more bumping into my arm/shoulder!  The best part was when some of the overweight staff and customers would try to ""squeeze"" by, or when staff would wait on the other table while their behind is right on my shoulder.  WTF?  What's up with staff walking by every minute here?   To top it off, the large party had a very energetic woman whose voice was synonymous with a fog horn...seated facing me...full volume with no control (like a typical 1st grader but louder).  I remember her whole conversation that night. In summary, THE PROS - good food and our server was good.  CONS - poor hosting, tables placed too close together (fire hazard?), staff had no problem repeatedly bumping customers while trying to enjoy their meal. This place lacks the environment consistent with the $100 check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=300
Rhonda P.,"Dana Point, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/30/2015,"From day to night, The Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place to eat out. Although, I have visited only a few locations such as the Mission Viejo and Irvine location, this restaurant has nearly 200 spots all throughout the U.S. Whether you're with your family, friends, on a date, or even by yourself, The Cheesecake Factory has a numerous amount of mouth-watering options and caters to anyone that loves food (and of course, cheesecake!). The Cheesecake Factory has the mood set with dimmed lights and trendy music. The beige and brown walls compliment the granite tile and the high ceilings give off a modern and elegant feel. Seating options range from indoor booths and tables to an outside patio. Once you are seated, you will be handed a menu and a basket filled with warm squaw and baguette bread (which by the way, is so addicting, you won't want to leave until receiving at least 3 servings). Inside the menu are endless choices of lunch, dinner, and desserts. And for the early birds, happy hour occurs from 4pm-6pm. I suggest ordering the Roadside Sliders; 4 mini burgers consisting of juicy meat topped with your choice of condiments all inside a flavorful bun. If you're trying to aim for a healthier meal, try out the Skinnylicious Menu. Gluten free? No problem! There is even a gluten-free menu! Whichever menu you decide to order off of, make sure you come hungry, the portions are huge! It's no mystery that The Cheesecake Factory is known for selling their award-winning cheesecakes. The cheesecake is served by the slice with whipped cream and/or other delicious toppings depending on what flavor you choose. For those that have a rich and creamy palette, The Oreo Dream Extreme and Reese's Peanut Butter are superb, or for those that enjoy more sophisticated and simple flavors, opt for The Original with Fresh Strawberries. I have tasted most of the flavors, and I have to say they are all crowd-pleasers.  The Cheesecake Factory has increased in a larger amount of sales every year since 1978. Not only do their cheesecakes win over the customers, but it's their large variety of lunch, dinner, and everything in between that gets customer's attention. There is something for everyone from the Skinnylicious Menu to the gluten-free menu. The customer service is outstanding and I have never encountered an unpleasant experience. I walk out more than satisfied every time I eat there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=300

Anywho, when I come here I always order about 6 of the same items in rotation.  I usually get the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, Boston House Salad, Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, Garlic Noodles with Chicken, Shrimp Scampi,  Shrimp with Angel Hair, and the Ribs.  All of those items are delicious.  I can't say anything bad about these items.  The complimentary bread they give you is a hit or miss for me.  Sometimes it's nice a hot and other times it seems hard.  Overall, the food here is yummy.  My sister gave me a gift card here for my bday so I can't wait to use it!!!  The only problem I have is the crowd and the wait.  The crowd is always the same.  It's either stupid teens/young adults or old people who think they own the place and are better than anyone and everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=300

The young newer wait staff needs more training or needs to care more. Their service has not been living up to the cheesecake reputation . I live in the area and I frequent this restaurant regularly. This has been an on going problem since last year. Actually it's usually the young men who are slow and not on top of things. Cheesecake really is fine dining in a casual style. And these young men don't measure up. You've really got to do something about it. They just don't care or they aren't trained well. Please step your game because the sub par service has become the new normal at the mission Viejo location. I'm going to ask for the more mature seasoned wait staff from now on. I'll asked to be seated in their section from now on. It's just not fun or special there anymore and hasn't been for awhile. The wait staff vibe is blah. Please train them better.

Drinks take a long time to get refilled and management just seems lazy about dress code for most their servers. If they don't care about dress code, and the server doesn't care about looking nice, what's the chance the servers gonna care about you? I give it a 2 for the cheesecakes.

Jamie M.,"San Clemente, CA",4,1,,5.0,12/6/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory at the Shops of Mission Viejo has a wide variety of consumers. With the location of this Cheesecake Factory being inside a mall, it attracts many families of hungry shoppers who are picking up a last minute bite after a long day of shopping. With the dimed lights and quiet music playing in the background it is a superb place to end your extensive day. Not only is it a lovely family restaurant, with their huge flat screen TV's plastered against all the walls it is also a great place for a girls or guys night out. They can take the time to relax and enjoy the latest games with a nice cold beer or wine at the bar together. It is also a great place for a special occasion or dinner for two. The Cheesecake factory is a casual dining restaurant with a suitable price range that is perfect for any family dinner night, game night, and even fancy date night. The service there at The Cheesecake Factory is as lovely as the looks of it. The waiters and waitresses have knowledge of the menu and are extremely helpful in recommendations. Even with the overcrowd of tables and swarmed amount of people the workers still take the time to make sure your time is pleasant. With that your time there is more comforting. Cheesecakes Factory has something for everyone. With over 200 selections on the menu made fresh everyday you will be sure to find something that will fulfill your starved cravings. However with so many mouth-watering items to choose from, it may be hard to decide which one of the great choices to get. I suggest their Four Cheese Pasta. Penne Pasta submerged in mozzarella, ricotta, romano and parmesan cheeses, topped with their glorious marinara sauce and fresh basil. After your journey of engulfing yourself in mountains of pasta, you are left with your tingled taste buds. Another entre that may suit you is their Chargrilled Coulotte Steak, U.S.D.A. prime sirloin topped with creamy butter. Also with that, thick, full-mouthed steak, you are served with boasts of golden brown french fries and crispy onion rings. These and the numerous other entrees of the menu are excellent choices.  Not only are their entrees the bomb, they also have many spectacular appetizers and appetizing salads. Their Fried Macaroni Appetizer has to be one of my ultimate favorites. Crispy crumb coated macaroni and cheese shaped into circular balls, topped over with a tongue tingling marinara sauce. Just the description makes you hungry. And you can never go wrong with salad. My recommendation is the Santa Fe Salad. Lime-marinated chicken, fresh corn, black beans, cheese, tortilla strips, tomato and mixed greens with a hot peanut-cilantro vinaigrette. All those elements mixed together are heaven on a plate. Sometimes it is the little things that make you happy. Saving the best for last is the famous Cheesecake. Even after your entire dinner, and you are already slipped into a food coma, you cannot resist the temptation of these jaw-dropping cheesecakes. From 30 different cheesecakes to choose from, this could be one of the most difficult decisions one must make. Original, strawberry, chocolate, lemon, low carb, key lime, vanilla, and pumpkin are just a few of the many cheesecakes. I would have to say my top pick would be the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Layers of flourless Godiva chocolate cake, Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse with whip cream as the final touches. This cheesecake is too good; it can make a vanilla lover turn to a chocoholic. You may be thinking, this is a chocolate concoction, and this must not be good for you. The answer to that is you are right. Most of the cheesecakes range 1000 calories for a slice, but everyone deserves a cheat day once and a while and I am positive that you will not regret it after you take in the masterpiece of flavors. These cheesecakes at The Cheesecake factory are to die for. The Cheesecake Factory is a happening place, and there is no surprise that it is. With such a comforting feel everyone is welcomed and enjoys their stay. And the food is just superb. From their Santa Fe Salad to their Chargrilled Coulotte Steak and everything in between, it is all cooked to perfection with only the best of ingredients. The cheesecakes are to die for; you can't ever go wrong with one to end an amazing meal. On top of that the pricing is seemly and the quantity is overwhelming. I definitely recommend this restaurant and next time you are deciding where to dine for the night, go to The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=320

Tash K.,"Laguna Hills, CA",2,7,,2.0,1/29/2015,"I rarely have the urge  to write a review, however  after reading some of the others, I had to include mine (Thanks Joy)  If you are a party of 5 or more be prepared to wait for a VERY long time.  I think the front of the house staff needs better training for sure.   On a Wednesday evening, we agreed to wait the 1.5 hour wait to celebrate my nephew's birthday.  However, after approaching this time line and the kids being hungry and screaming, when the front of house staff was approached, she had the audacity to tell me ""sir, that table may want to stay there for 7 hours if they choose"".  This is not how you win over loyal customers.  Thank goodness the manager was pleasant and was trying to alleviate the matter.  I feel that the corporate office needs to revisit their front house training, and their timeline tactics, if they are not to take reservations.  NO party should be allowed to sit at a table for ""7 hours"" unless they have a private room in that  restaurant location.  It does not matter how good the food, or the wait staff is .... our experience was already ruined by the time we got to our table!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=320
Edrees H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",63,128,,2.0,9/30/2010,"First, a confession. For the first 18 years of my life, I thought that this place only sold cheesecakes. I scoffed at people for coming here for dinner, I was a real man, and didn't have dessert for dinner.  Then someone told me they served food, and in huge portions. I learned my lesson, and also, learned a valuable lesson in marketing. 7 to 8 years later I've never told anyone this, but confessed it on yelp. Now that I've established how honest I am, you can take my review legit, I'm willing to admit anything. This location sucked major cheeseballs. The food came out the wrong way, and the waitress was rude and, I suspect possibly racist considering we were the only non white people in the entire building. Also she was VERY nice and happy and smiling to the people next to us, who were not a minority, but around our same age. So you can decide for yourself what that means. I doubt it was my shirt because I was wearing a pretty slick shirt..ahem, okay.. I bet most of these reviews are giving it high ratings because it's Cheesecake factory - which is a great restaurant - but as far as how I rate chains, I just rate them comparitively to other locations. And I far prefer the Irvine Spectrum location. Go there if you can, avoid this rotten hate zone. -I asked for salad dressing on the side, she said ""dry?"" I said no not dry, on the side. She said oh okay, and instead it came dry with no salad dressing. -She was frowning everytime we requested anything.  -I asked if I could substitute a different type of soup into my meal and she said no. Other locations usually say ""I don't think so but if you want that soup with a meal can I recommend this item?"" Didn't really get that. I don't mean to sound like a brat, but if I'm gonna pay extra to be served, I'd rather not be frowned and constantly been given the run around. Food itself is typical cheesecake factory and very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=320

Steve C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",5,70,2,2.0,8/2/2010,"After numerous visits to this location over the last couple of years, the only conclusion that can be made is that it's pedestrian and inconsistent, at best.  Most visits have been because we received gift cards to come back after complaining about how lousy the food is. People generally go to chain restaurants for the consistency but not here. On three separate occasions we've ordered some type of noodle/pasta dish and each time the noodles were undercooked and literally sticking together. I'm all for al-dente but this was just blatantly undercooked. No attention to detail.  I've also sent two other dishes back because they were way over seasoned with salt. You don't need to cover up good food with too much salt and it just looks like the people in the kitchen don't have a clue and there's nobody checking what they do before it goes out. The last incident was last Saturday for lunch. I ordered the Thai Chicken Pasta and it was so salty, it was inedible. I ordered the Orange Chicken as a replacement which is usually great but even that was dry, stringy and had almost no sauce.  It's even more disappointing being a shareholder but once or even twice I could maybe get past. 4-5 times is unacceptable. Hopefully they eventually turn it around but I'm not holding my breath and I'm not going back.    The only redeeming quality is the service which is generally very good and the strawberry lemonade is awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=340

Sarah Z.,"Maricopa, AZ",0,1,,1.0,4/15/2013,"I used to come to this Cheesecake Factory all the time and loved the cheesecake.  Unfortunately, I recently found out that I am gluten intolerant and stopped coming here. But last night, my friends wanted to get cheesecake and I figured I could find something gluten free here. Our waitress was very nice and helped me pick out a gluten free entree. I ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes without the sauce. They were pretty bland, but not horrible. When it came time for dessert, my friend asked if they had any gluten free desserts. I was so excited when they told me they had gluten free flourless Godiva cheesecake. It was delicious, and we left the restaurant full and happy. Unfortunately, I woke up at 1 a.m. and was extremely sick. I called the Cheesecake Factory and was very upset to hear that they cook their ""gluten free"" cheesecake in flour.  If you don't have dietary restrictions, then this is an okay place to eat; however, the managers and waitresses are not informed enough about the food so it is definitely not safe for people with Celiac's or any kind of food allergy. Next time I will stick to eating at restaurants with a gluten free menu, or at least an allergy list. EDIT: I received an apology from the manager and a gift card.

Kristine C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",13,88,10,1.0,8/18/2011,"So sad...wrote a review almost 2 years ago on how awesome the experience was. Not sure what has gone on with the way this place is managed, but seriously has gone downhill in service.  The servers obviously provide that extra special attention to those they believe they will benefit from the most. I get it, they are trying to make a living. Perhaps this was just our particular server the last time, but I am highly disappointed in the level of service especially for a restaurant that is so highly regarded with respect to Chains.  If I am wrong then how is it that a couple that was seated after us received bread, and was checked on during their meal at least 8 times while my husband and I sat there in the heat with our drinks melting, didn't receive any bread (not even acknowledgement that the server may have forgotten to bring the bread to us) and were only visited when our food items came out. It was clearly understood that we were not given the same level of service as the other couple who I hoped tipped the server $100 they way he was waiting on them.  Service is SO important and as I've read in some other yelp reviews, there is an area of inconsistency and concern. Unfortunately I will no longer be returning to this location as I now prefer Irvine or Garden Walk, Pasadena, Victoria Gardens because they know how to provide good service. I hope they can address and increase their service level.

We were stuffed at the end and didn't have room for dessert. Maybe next time we'll try the banana cheesecake that was recommended by Ben.

Matthew T.,"Irvine, CA",3,21,,4.0,3/7/2009,"There is one big reason to come to this Cheesecake Factory over the one at the Spectrum: it is usually much less crowded. The crowds here are directly related to how busy the mall is, so when the mall is really busy, I'm sure this place is packed.

My experience is based on going out to dinner at 8pm or later. Even on Friday and Saturday night, when the Spectrum Cheesecake gets huge crowds and ridiculous wait times, I have never had to wait more than a few minutes to get a table here. Coming here instead of the Spectrum could mean the difference between a wait of over an hour, and being seated immediately. As far as other differences between the MV location and the Spectrum, I don't think it is much different. After all they are both Cheesecake Factory. I have had friends insist that the Spectrum location was better, but for me, I really didn't notice anything significant. The only time I came here where I had to wait for a table, was on a Sunday during the day, when the mall was full of shoppers, and the place was packed for lunch. At those times, the Spectrum location might actually have less of a wait than this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=360
Dan F.,"Irvine, CA",47,20,35,5.0,11/25/2010,"Don't let the 3.5 star rating fool you, there is a reason this place is always packed, it is a FIVE STAR restaurant at a mid-price! I am in the restaurant biz myself, and a huge fan of Cheesecake. This location is my all-around favorite restaurant in this area of South County, and it doesn't get as busy as the Cheesecakes in the tourist areas, like the Spectrum and Newport Center.  IMHO Cheesecake is THE BEST CHAIN RESTAURANT PERIOD, even better than most independents! If you have ever worked in a restaurant, then you know that what they deliver on this grand scale is amazing for the reasonable prices they charge. The quality of the food is constantly outstanding. The portions are huge, always some to take home. The menu is gigantic, the size of a telephone book, and it has the widest range of different dishes in the biz. The dishes are very creative. If there isn't something you like here, well, "" then there is no pleasing you, Mr. Powers."" The staff is plentiful, friendly and very well-trained. The bar is great and has many unique drinks. Try their Mojito. And of course, the desserts speak for themselves, if you can manage to somehow save room for them. The decor and atmosphere is very upscale and comfortable for such a mid-priced restaurant. They do a good job of making it as private as possible for such a crowded place.  The low ratings of some of the reviews here seem to be related to the kind of service/order issues that always come up in a big, high-traffic operation like this one. But, I would say that because Cheesecake is so used to high traffic, that in general they do a much better job of dealing with it than most restaurants. Of course, with staff turnover, that can vary in any restaurant. I've also noticed that very busy restaurants tend to get slammed with more low reviews on Yelp than your regular locals type place. I think it is because people who wait a long time for food tend to get cranky and have a lower tolerance for even the slightest issue. Every minor problem suddenly gets magnified!  Also, at ""Special Occasion"" kind of places, expectations are much higher, and a review may be based on a only single visit, often during a major holiday when the restaurant is slammed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=360

That's the power a retailer has when they have a reputation to maintain. That's a good thing.  My favorite menu items right now? I like the stuffed mushrooms in that cheese sauce, followed by the chicken madera and BBQ chicken salad or Santa Fe salad.

Jack G.,"Fontana, CA",111,178,7,3.0,9/25/2008,"Sunday night was my second time for this location. My first experience involved a long wait and unmemorable food. This time we were seated immediately and I can at least recall what I ordered. First off, the service: 5 stars. We wanted for naught the whole 60 plus minutes we were there, and it was accompanied by a smile and excellent suggestions. The appetizer: Tex-Mex Eggrolls. I could make a meal of those beauties alone. Their description: ""Spicy Chicken, Corn, Black Beans, Peppers, Onions and Melted Cheese. Served with Avocado Cream and Salsa."" The salsa was fresh pico de gallo, and was delicious. The avocado cream was green creamy stuff that seemed to disappear fast as soon as the green creamy stuff lovers discovered its green creaminess. 5 stars for this app. The mains: I had the Shepherd's Pie, which is misnamed. It should be called Cottage Pie because it's made with ground beef. Shepherd's Pie is made with lamb.... but I digress. It was pretty good... but nothing to flip over. It is described as ""Ground Beef, Mushrooms, Carrots, Peas, Zucchini and Onions in a Delicious Sauce Covered with Mashed Potatoes and Parmesan Cheese."" It was a bit salty for my taste though. Still, I put a big dent in it, and had enough leftover for next day's lunch. 3 stars. I won't be ordering it again, however. N had the Chicken Madeira. It is described as ""Sauteed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce. Served with Mashed Potatoes."" She enjoyed it immensely. I had some of hers, and would give it 4 stars. It would have gotten 5 had the asparagus not been so tough. This is what I'm ordering on my next CF outing. T had the Santa Fe Salad, which is described as ""Lime-Marinated Chicken, Fresh Corn, Black Beans, Cheese, Tortilla Strips, Tomato and Mixed Lettuces with a Spicy Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette."" He seemed to enjoy it, but I didn't sample it as I'm not a fan of vinaigrette. Or lettuce. Or salad. For afters, I ordered a piece of banana cream cheesecake, and they split a piece of key lime cheesecake. Mine is described as being topped with Bavarian cream, but it wasn't. It was mounded with lots of what I call ""Corporate Whipped Cream"". I know from Bavarian cream, and that ain't what was on there. All in all, the desserts were uninspiring. Good, but not worth what they charge. I would give what I ordered 2 stars and the key lime 3 stars. Mine lost half a star for lying about the Bavarian cream.

Tet W.,"Portland, OR",44,225,90,3.0,10/8/2012,"Today I came for lunch after shopping for a dining room table.  I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a number of times and usually ordered their chicken fettuccine alfredo or their chicken and angel hair which is good.  I diverged from ordering pasta and had their club sandwich.  Hate to say it, it was a disappointment.  The missing ingredient they didn't have was the avocado and it made a huge difference in this sandwich.  The avocado brings richness, flavor and helps to tie the turkey and bacon flavors together.  The absence of this key ingredient made the sandwich bland in flavor and relative it tasted like any other sandwich you can make at home.  With a price tag of $12, I don't think this is something I would recommend ordering.  I think next time, I'll stick with their pastas.  This lunch sized pastas are huge and are more than adequate for lunch or dinner.  Their bread is great but it would be nice if they kept their butter at room temperature so that you can spread it easier.  Overall, it's in a nice location, our server was nice and attentive and seating was prompt.  This is a nice place for a nice casual lunch with friends or family.  Portion size is large so be okay with eating leftovers as you'll likely not finish your plate. The ambiance is classic traditional with a modern Italian flair and if you muster enough space after consuming your gut busting entree, I would highly recommend trying one of their many excellent variations of their cheesecake.  It's huge so it's perfect for sharing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=380

I M A.,"Long Beach, CA",0,14,,2.0,6/17/2010,"Here is the letter that I've forwarded to the Cheesecake Factory's MV location and corporate office, from which I have not gotten a response:  ""On June 5, 2010, we visited your restaurant in Mission Viejo. Our visit did not start out well. We arrived at 1:00pm after 3 runners (in our party of 7, plus a baby of less than one year old) completed the Camp Pendleton Mud Run. We were greeted at the front desk and given a buzzer and told that the wait would be  1/2 an hour for a ""first available"" table. After waiting 40 minutes and watching EVERYONE (approx. 30 people) in the waiting area being seated before us, we decided to check on the status of a table.  The hostess informed us that the table that we were waiting for had received their check, and that we would be seated shortly.  A party of similar size then walked right in and was seated before us.  We again waited, but not before one of our party members talked to the manager -on- duty (female, blondish, tall, early thirties).  Our party member (he) noticed an end booth in the bar area was available, but the manager stated ""that table can be tight for large people"". As I stated before, 3 are runners, marathoners in fact, and one is a baby! Let's put that aside, the fact is the statement was inappropriate and rude. He told the manager that we could fit there and put the baby on the end where no other diners would be seated.  We were finally seated after over an hour wait. Perhaps your staff, management especially, needs some training in how to deal with the public.  On a good note, our waiter, Hutton, was excellent.  Just after we were seated, a small plate of sliced bananas and bread came out for the baby-that was a nice touch. Although it took awhile to get bread and butter, all of our orders were correct, came out timely, and were delicious.  Our entire party works in the service industry, and was appalled in the wording in which your manager chose to inform us that a table would not suit our needs because of her perception of our ""size"".  It is our hope that bringing this issue to your attention gives your staff the opportunity to avoid this exchange in the future.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=380

Inside this high-class diner, there are plush seat cushions and flat screen televisions to enjoy your favorite sports games. The dim lighting and chandeliers create an intriguing mood making your dining experience unforgettable.  The Cheesecake Factory is recommended for all ages, but the food can be a little pricy. Although the food ranges from $3.95 to $40.00, every meal is worth the price.   Every time someone steps into this friendly environment, one thing is for sure. And that is that no one can ever pass up on a slice of cheesecake. With twenty nine different flavors, you will never be disappointed. The number one, most popular cheesecake, would have to be the Fresh Banana Cream. Baked with a vanilla, waffle crust, and topped with rich Bavarian cream, this cheesecake will leave you speechless.  You may want to carefully choose your meal because if you miss out on dessert, you will most definitely regret it. You can never be too full for a slice of their exquisite cheesecake!   If you're looking for a mouth-watering meal, one of the signature dishes is the Chicken Marsala.  This chicken breast is sautéed with fresh mushrooms, slathered in a creamy, Marsala, white wine sauce, and served over bow tie pasta. Grilled perfectly right, the chicken breast is tender and sides well with the bow tie noodles. The richness of the sauce corresponds well with the rest of the dish and makes the meat moister. The large portion of this meal fills you up, so you may want to take the left over's home with you.   Another favored dish is the Chicken Madeira. This includes seared chicken breast topped with crisp asparagus and freshly grained mozzarella cheese. Not only is it coated with luscious mushroom, Madeira sauce, but is also served with a side of soft, golden mashed potatoes. Customers are encouraged to order this dish because it is highly praised and almost all waiters recommend it. You get your money's worth from this tasty meal and won't want to order anything else the next time you visit.   I am always more than satisfied after I leave The Cheesecake Factory and never disappointed. Every meal is delicious and every slice of cheesecake is worth waiting for. Whether you live close or far away from this restaurant, you should try and dine here at least once. The employees will make you feel comfortable and just at home whenever you step inside.

Maybe it has really gone downhill or maybe it's just this location, but when I went yesterday, both the food and service were extremely disappointing.  We started off with Buffalo Blasts for appetizer. I had Buffalo Rolls at Grand Lux (also part of the Cheesecake Factory chain) and it was really good and I thought this was similar. Boneless buffalo chicken and cheese deep fried in crispy skin - how can you go wrong with that? Alas, it was really greasy and there wasn't much chicken or cheese or flavor. I ordered Miso Salmon for entree, which is one of my sister's favorite dishes. The salmon itself was fine, but the bed of rice underneath was overcooked and hard. Dessert was the only saving grace. We tried their 30th anniversary cheesecake, which was basically the original cheesecake layered with their fudge cake. It was really good - the texture of the fudge cake was a nice contrast to the cheesecake.  If I only rated this place on food, I might have given it 2 1/2 stars because of the dessert (although I've had much better food at other Cheesecake Factories). However, the service was also not great. I had a late lunch so I wasn't that hungry so I only ate about half of my entree. The waitress came by and asked if we wanted to get a box. We were still talking so my companion said that we were still working on it. My waitress looked at my plate and said in a somewhat snide manner, ""you know, if you put your knife and fork to the side, it means you are done."" I wasn't paying any attention to my plate and I was actually done, but even if I wasn't, I didn't need a lecture from my waitress on etiquette. I thought that was rather rude. Minus 1 point for that. We didn't finish the cheesecake so I took it home and the box was not closed tight so when I stopped a little too quickly at a light, the cheesecake box flew open and the whipped cream tumbled onto my car carpet. I had to scrub really hard to that oil stain off my carpet. Minus another point for that.

Erika T.,"Glendale, CA",42,26,3,5.0,12/29/2007,"THE POSITIVES (there's a lot!): This is the best Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Hands down. I know you might think they're all the same, but they're certainly not. I've had the one in Pasadena, I've had the one at the Grove, Spectrum, etc.. and they're just not as good. I still love them, don't get me wrong, but the Mission Viejo location is the best. THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT CF IS THAT YOU CAN GET ANYTHING MODIFIED EXACTLY HOW YOU WANT IT. my sister works there, thankfully, or else i would have never known this. You can change practically anything on any dish to be prepared exactly how you want it. Change the bread on a sandwich, use a different dressing on your salad, etc. they make it so easy and are very used to changing things for people and really don't mind. my sister says it's better to tell your server any and all changes you want right away, because that way you'll be happy with your meal and it'll be easier for her to make sure you get it exactly how you want it.  Cheesecake factory isn't too pricey, but it isn't cheap either. Most menu items will run you 11-16 dollars, but of course there's the exceptions-- most things steak or fish will be much more expensive. But the portions of any items make the price worth it. You can easily split a salad or sandwich between two people. Whenever I go with a friend, we order a salad and an entree, making sure to split each and we walk out of there at about 15 dollars a person, plus tip, so around 20 a person, which really isn't bad for two people eating a big lunch. If you want to go but aren't sure what to order, I highly recommend the following-- Thai Lettuce Wraps, An Oscars (technically it's discontinued, but they still know how to make it at most locations) or any of their burgers or pizzas.  I cannot stress enough that most all their items are delicious. Thanks to my sister, I've tried at least 2/3 of what's on their ridiculously large menu, and I have yet to be disappointed.  The cons: I wouldn't buy alcohol from this place. Their drinks are really expensive (6+ dollars for a beer, 9+ dollars for a drink) and are pretty weak. There can be a wait most afternoons and nights, but they try and get you in as quick as possible. People are starting to bring their kids there, not realizing Cheesecake Factory doesn't have a kids menu and isn't meant to be a place for kids to hang around. But that is never too big of a problem. THE BEST: happy hour!! It's from 4-6, i think just on the week days, but I'm not sure- it could be every day. Avocado eggrolls, hamburger sliders, lettuce wraps, mac and cheese, side salads (that can be modified however you want), etc are all 4-6 dollars. So cheap, pretty good portions and delicious. i would definitely recommend. (longest. review. ever.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=400
Marjorie M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",26,107,1,4.0,12/18/2009,"We were using an early Christmas gift card from a friend,and  were really excited to go as I recently got out of the hospital after a five month stay after major surgery. Still using a W/C, so we were a little apprehensive about crowds, long waits, being able to maneuver the chair etc. No worries, as there were no people waiting! (Economy, ya think?) Service was quick & pleasant, if a little off. Hubby had the Charbroiled Flat Iron Steak. He thought it could have been hotter. His French Fries were way too salty. I had the Herb Crusted Fillet of Salmon. Both were delicious, cooked perfectly. So delicious we couldn't believe it  was a chain restaurant. All fish is advertised as fresh. New York Cheesecake for dessert. It came covered in whipped cream (Yuck!)) That was the only letdown. The cheescake itself wasn't as great or fresh as I remembered from a previous visit..Service became a little odd as our meal wore on, nothing major, just a loss of attention from our server to get extra lemon for the Salmon. After asking three times and being assured it was coming,  It  got delivered finally to the neighboring table by the busboy, who then saw us staring at the lemons, picked up the plate off that neighboring table and quickly plunked the lemons down at ours. Fortunately, they were not touched .Both of the tables were a little surprised at that one! Otherwise, overall, better than the average mall restaurant!

Jenny D.,"Westminster, CA",31,48,21,2.0,6/27/2009,"This was my first time at this particular location.  It was Friday night at around 8:30.  We got seated right away at a table for two.  They have a new menu of small bites.  I have had gastric bypass.  I can eat only little portions.  I asked the waitress how big the pizzaettes were and she showed me with her hands how tiny they were.  Basically she made it seem like they were only slightly larger that a stack of cards.  My friend asked about the ahi and the waitress told her it was only one small bite and that this menu was designed for a lot of sampling with a group of people.  Because of my bypass I decided to go with the small bites menu and ordered the sausage pizzaette and the crispy artichoke hearts.  As we waited, they delivered us lots of bread.  My friend and I ate quite a bit of this - assuming we didn't have much food coming.  When the food arrived I was quite surprised.  The pizzaette is actually a good size.  It was about ten inches long and four inches wide in an oblong shape.  The plate of artichoke hearts had at least 15 on it.  Needless to say I could only eat one piece of the pizza.  I got it boxed and my friend had her's boxed as well.  We advised the guy that took our food who got what.  He gave us our separate bags and we didn't think to look inside.  Since my friend was ordering cheesecake, I decided to try one of their latte's.  They said they had soy milk which I had to have because I'm lactose intolerant.  It was expensive though at five dollars.  She didn't mention that the soy milk would be extra.  On the way home I started to feel very nauseated and bloated.  I think they gave me regular milk as I'm still feeling the after effects.  I opened my box a little while ago to discover I didn't get my food.  There were about three onion rings in there.  I had a whole pizzaette and like 15 artichoke hearts that I didn't get.  I'm pissed.  I guess I should have looked, but I've never had them give me someone else's food before.  So 17 dollars later, I got a small slize of pizza and a coffee.  This place bummed me out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=400

I knew the one the Spectrum had a great happy hour on food so we thought we might be able to get some good drinks as well.

There are tons of pages and you may want to study ahead to be prepared. After many minutes of Flipping through the pages we went with the grilled chicken tostada salad and the Thai lettuce wraps. The portions are huge so be prepared me ready to share. I recommend if with a big group trying as many items as you can. Also ask the waiter for help if needed because there are over 259 items to choose from. As far as the cheesecake that is obviously a must. Close your eyes and point to a couple to try!

Jonathan V.,"Irvine, CA",131,1,,1.0,6/12/2016,"Ruined the rest of our night - poor customer service. I want to preface this by saying, I know everyone will have a different experience eating here. You may experience no problems whatsoever- with perfect food and a friendly waitstaff. Heck I've even experienced great service here before. However tonight was different.  Now I never write reviews, but the events of this evening have inclined me to do just that. -Hopefully by the end of the review you will have a better judgment of if you want to eat here or not.  The evening started off on the right foot with the waiter asking us for our drink orders and also offering bread. We ordered the Calamari appetizer we always order as well as a dip. For our entrees, I was happy to know that they could still make a Barbecue Salmon even though it was no longer on the menu. The person I was with ordered their favorite dish that they ALWAYS get: Lemon Crusted Chicken with Couscous.  They appetizers came out fine however the the Calamari portion seemed smaller than usual. When the entrees came out was a whole different story. My entree came out fine and a portion I expected. However, the Lemon Crusted Chicken with Couscous came out about half size portion or less. We are used to the dish being fairly big and fulfilling, and it usually is a dish that can be shared. There are usually two pieces of chicken strip about 4oz each. If you have eaten at Cheesecake Factory before, you know how big their portions usually are. There was BARELY any couscous and hardly any chicken. There were four total smashed chicken pieces and appeared to be less than a half portion.  What was worse was that it appeared they tried to compensate the lesser chicken and couscous with just more spinach and other vegetables to fill the plate. Since the person I was with normally orders the dish they soon realized that portion was much smaller than usual. Here is where things started to get ugly. - we flagged down the waiter and carefully explained to him that the portion of chicken AND couscous appeared to be much less than usual. My first impression of his response was that he was speculative but he then too ACKNOWLEDGED that the chicken also to be much less than usual. But we were then underwhelmed by his offer. He offered to just bring another chicken and asked if that is what would make us satisfied or if he had to do a re-fire. We explained that the chicken was not the only problem of the dish but that the whole PRESENTATION of the dish was UNSATISFACTORY. He obliged to do a refire but also told us we were now going to be taken care of by another waiter as he had to step away for 10min - he NEVER came back to our table after. The waiter who replaced him was fine and she served us the rest of the night.  But this is when things really got out of hand for us. 10 or so minutes later the manager Amy Wright delivered the redone and corrected dish to our table. However, rather than acknowledging and APOLOGIZING for the mistake in portion size, her first comment upon delivering the dish was ""I just want you to know that we in the kitchen normally do not put this much chicken on this dish, so in the future don't expect this much."" She also then proceeded to explain that this dish comes with 2 4oz pieces and that we were getting more this time. Are you kidding me? We then explained to Amy that that was not the portion that was initially given and we know the usual portion because we order the dish a lot. It appeared to us that she had not even seen the original dish. She then walked away.  However the fact that we had to defend ourselves was incomprehensible and unforgivable. Amy, as a manager, should have deescalated the situation by coming to the table and APOLOGIZING for the kitchen's mistake and offering to make the situation better for the customer. She DID NOT ONCE APOLOGIZE the entire night. And as a customer, all I know is what I'm used to-  I do not care about the logistics of my order. I just want the situation resolved. Do not make me feel like the bad guy if it is your kitchen that is not making the dish correctly. We were not asking for the moon. We just saw an inconsistency and wanted it resolved.  Unfortunately the person I was with was no longer hungry due to the wait and we ended up asking for it to go. What overall made it worse and what was the nail on the coffin was that Cheesecake Factory DID NOT initially COMPENSATE us on the bill for the Chicken and Couscous meal and for the inconvenience. WE HAD TO ASK. Oh and we later saw our initial waiter, however he was helping the BIGGER party next to us.  We never once made an outlandish request and we were initially understanding, however Amy Wright the manager did not deescalate the situation and instead escalated it. They never made an attempt to correct their wrongdoing and just took the easy way out. Overall an unnecessary unsatisfactory experience and a bitter end to the night as I am stuck writing this.

Ray V.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",153,164,307,4.0,2/26/2015,"Known for having a ridiculously large menu, Cheesecake Factory serves up some tasty treats in an upscale casual setting.  They have 20+ chicken dishes and a menu spanning 10+ pages.  I've been to this location at least 10 times with my most recent visit just a couple of days ago. Here's my breakdown... TIP 1:  Call for a reservation or to check on wait times.  This place gets packed TIP 2:  They offer curb side pick up for phone orders.  Yes they walk it out to your car and handle payment and everything.   GOOD 1:  The food is good.  I'm not saying it's going to blow you away and be a unforgettable experience but it is good.    My wife ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and really enjoyed it.  I ordered a Breaded Chicken with a lemon sauce and it was excellent. GOOD 2:  They are very kid friendly.  This is the reason I have them the 4th star.  We have a 18 month old daughter and once we were sat we were immediately asked if we wanted a ""baby plate"".  We said yes and it was on our table in 2 minutes.  For those that don't know what a baby plate is... it's a small plate of tiny bread pieces and cut up banana.  It's perfect to keep your little one busy for a few minutes while mommy and daddy go over the menu and make selections. GOOD 3:  The staff we fast, friendly, and accurate.  We were checked on every 10-15 minutes like clockwork.  I asked for a minor customization and they happily obliged.    BAD 1:  The menu is just silly.  It's way too big and doesn't really draw your attention to anything.  It's always annoying to me when I have to read a menu like a novel just to know what my options are.  In retail it's called ""paradox of choice"" and in a nutshell it turns off customers.  That's how I feel about their menu. BAD 2:  Parking is a nightmare... it's in a Mall so it's not their fault but it is part of my experience as I only went there for Cheesecake Factory.   Overall it's a nice place to eat and has lots of choices.  It's clean and the staff is friendly.  The thing that stands out for me and why it's on my regular list is the effort they put in to make dining with small children enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-mission-viejo?start=120
