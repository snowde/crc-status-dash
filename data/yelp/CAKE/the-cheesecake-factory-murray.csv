McKenzie B.,"Provo, UT",129,116,129,5.0,12/15/2017,"Here's the deal... The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant and although I typically try to stick to smaller, local joints, I LOVE eating here. It's just a classic chain choice. The menu options can be overwhelming but if you know what to get ahead of time, you won't be disappointed. That's why I'm here to tell you what to get! The avocado egg rolls are a MUST when it comes to appetizers and I love the Thai lettuce wraps as a meal (even though they are listed as an appetizer). The orange chicken is also a hit but make sure you ask for extra sauce since the chicken can sometimes be a little dry. If you're wanting something heavier, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta is also delicious if you are wanting something heavier.  The pros: HUGE portions, warm bread before your meal, lots of items to choose from and TONS of yummy dessert options, duh! The cons: dark, loud, and the menu options can be overwhelming, a little pricier than other chain restaurants. And most importantly, you can't go wrong with any of their cheesecake flavors (especially any peanut butter / chocolate combo).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray
Kyle C.,"South Jordan, UT",1,11,,3.0,12/28/2017,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I enjoy it for what it is, but sometimes I really don't have the best experience when I try new things. I learned to stop trying different menu items and just stick with the three cheese pasta, or the spaghetti and meatballs. Those two dishes are very consistent and really good. You get large portions, and I'm always full with leftovers. Unfortunately, the steaks really aren't worth it (except Steak Diane, which is just okay). I had the filet mignon, and my wife had the ribeye. They were both mediocre, and I wouldn't order them again for the price we paid. It reminded me of a ""nicer"" Applebee's steak, which is the last place you should be getting steak from. They were cooked alright, but the meat was a bit stringy and tasted lower-quality (perhaps even lower grade) than other steaks in the area. Like mentioned above, neither of us have been overly impressed with any dish other than the pastas. Still, we find ourselves back there after shopping sometimes.  The waiters are friendly but usually a bit stiff due to how busy they are (being right next to the mall) we often don't get refills on drinks until it's too late, and the limited interactions we have with them feel rushed  The desserts aren't great unless you get cheesecake (go figure, it's in the name). I would skip dessert unless you're dying for cheesecake. Even then, there are way too many choices and I would advise sticking to tried and true flavors. I recently tried their chocolate layer cake, and it was dry and boring.  Despite other reviews, I love the dark ambience of this restaurant. To be honest, I think it makes the experience better, and a semi-romantic place to take a date or spouse. Basically, the darkness makes this restaurant seem way nicer than it actually is. This is a great ""stepping stone"" if you're just getting into nicer restaurants, because it's pricier and better than, say, Applebee's, but won't completely break the bank. We eat here when we want pasta, but definitely not when we want to eat at a super nice restaurant. The menu is way too jumbled and confusing, and they need to cut out a lot of random dishes that I can't imagine a lot of people are ordering.  My biggest negative about this restaurant is that I feel like it hasn't figured out what it wants to be. Is it...an Italian restaurant? Is it...a nicely disguised diner? Is it a literal factory where they make black-market cheesecake, and the restaurant is just a clever attempt at distraction? We may never know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray
Lee B.,"South Jordan, UT",198,79,347,4.0,11/30/2017,"Ok, so I have been going to the The Cheesecake Factory since I can remember. Growing up near several in Southern California gave me the opportunity to watch the restaurant grow and evolve. This Cheesecake is a great example of what it has become.  While the wait always seems to be long at this location, the staff is pretty welcoming and there is a good of space to sit inside, or you can wonder over to Z Gallery (another review coming). I love how the indoor seating has a nicely located cheesecake display, giving you the opportunity to decide what cake you want, before you indulge in bread and giant sized portions.  The restaurants design is very similar to most other Cheesecakes I have been in, with the exception of the bar area (that's a whole other story though). The seating comfortable and spread out. Tables are large, as they have to be for the ginormous plates.  Service is very structure and always seems to be by the book. I am always impressed with the team work atmosphere of the staff. You never feel like you are being ignored.  The food is always pretty consistent. I have never had an item that deviated greatly from the norm. While it is not exceptional, it is always good. The menu offer more then enough options to satisfy a small army, let alone your family.  The Cheesecake Factory has changed over the years, but it seems to have found its place and is staying there for the time being. If you want a lot choices and big portions, and willing to wait for a table, you have found your place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray
Evan A.,"Orem, UT",48,56,97,4.0,11/11/2017,"Love coming here. Closest Cheesecake Factory in Utah county. The staff is always friendly, wait times are fair.  The good is incredible. Today I had the salmon and it was cooked to perfection.  Was juicy, had the right amount of crisp to it and the lemon perfected the meal.  I ordered the side of asparagus as always because it comes out cooked perfect!   Our service is always top notch and love coming her in special occasions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray

Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",994,1007,3062,4.0,10/18/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has a spot in my heart.. or shall I say stomach haha. They have such a huge menu that is the same no matter where you go. One problem with that is that it can't be all delicious when you have such a large menu, but I have a few favorites that I love and can count on. Their cheesecakes are delicious too! So good - everyone of them! Customer service has always been good here. Like all Cheesecake Factory's, there is always a ridiculously long wait time - especially at this one! Everyone and their moms come and eat dinner here haha so allow time, or you will find yourself walking around the mall or going somewhere else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray
Oulie T.,"Sandy, UT",450,1159,1005,4.0,1/1/2018,What?! Only an average rating of 3 stars? What's up people? This little Cheesecake Factory spot totally deserves 4 stars at least!

Louisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",889,1080,6699,2.0,5/26/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory but this location never fails to provide a disappointing experience. I just stopped by for a late lunch today and everything just seemed to be a little ""off."" First, it was close to 2 pm and there were two dozen customers just hanging out in the lobby waiting to be seated in the nearly empty restaurant. Never a good sign. I promptly approached the hostess stand and the hostess was very short tempered and actually quite rude when asking, exasperated and with a loud sigh, ""how many?"" I told her two, and she literally snapped back ""give me 10 minutes okay?"" Um, wow, if you are having such a bad day, maybe you need to go take a little break and chill out. That's a surefire way to run off customers.  We were seated and finally approached by our server, and she too seemed to be really annoyed like she really, REALLY hated her job. She wasn't even remotely pleasant. I've rarely had servers that are so unhappy and unpleasant; it was so noticeable that we almost got up to leave, but we were so hungry (and I was craving avocado egg rolls) so we opted to stay.  The appetizer was good, but was haphazardly flung on our table by some other waiter. When our lunches arrived almost 20 minutes later, the plates were messy and carelessly thrown together. Talk about unappetizing. A kitchen should always take great pride in presenting a pretty dish, but both of our plates were as sloppy as they come. I had asked for sauteed spinach instead of mashed potatoes with my herb crusted chicken dish, and I was served a handful of RAW spinach just slapped on my plate! What? I had to ask for sauteed spinach and of course our waitress was annoyed but come on, RAW spinach? The vegetables were all poorly cooked, from my minuscule portion of green beans to my husband's barely steamed asparagus. I think the cooks on duty need to be trained on how to properly prepare veggies, stat! Even worse, my chicken was SO rubbery, to the point where I had to get a steak knife just to cut it and I nearly wore out my jaw trying to chew it. I am not exaggerating. I know I should've sent it back to the kitchen but at this point I was just so hungry and wanted to be done with this disappointing meal.  I never, ever complain about dining experiences but I feel like folks need to be aware of the problems at this location. Maybe corporate will take notice? This location needs some serious help!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray
Jade B.,"Lehi, UT",16,216,25,3.0,10/25/2017,"It's been a long time since I've been here. I came years ago and it left a distasteful experience last time hence why it's been so long. I wanted to leave a review though where I could remember my whole experience. So first off Saturday night super busy. So we try to plan to go little early like 5pm maybe the wait will be less. Nope still a 55 minute -75 minute wait. So we put our names down and wait. Get a booth seat which is nice and look over the menu.  Looked over the menu for a long long time before we were helped by our waitress. I've come to the conclusion too it's not there fault. There understaffed. They need more waitresses and waiters to turn tables over quicker. So the wait would always be less for those wanting to eat and they could make more money... just saying.  Anyway she takes are full order because we are beyond hungry and ready. Avocado Egg Rolls for appetizer, I got the Thai Lettuce Wraps as my entree, and my husband got the Enchiladas. Ended with a banana cream cheesecake to share.  So Avocado Egg Rolls! A+ they were amazing and actually like the highlight of my meal. My Thai Lettuce wraps were decently good too. My husband said his Enchiladas were good but not as good as a Mexican restaurant of course. He said the rice was terrible no flavor. The Avocado Egg Rolls $12 pretty pricy for a appetizer but possibly worth it in my opinion. Thai Lettuce wraps $15? Eh I've had better for cheaper. My husbands $15 Enchiladas. Also had better for cheaper.  Cheesecake worth it and yummy!  My conclusion is this... this place is lacking in service and needs some help with that to get people in and out the door quicker. Next is the quality of food vs the price isn't matching depending on the items. So overall experience is probably would only come back if someone I knew really really wanted to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray

Jared K.,"Riverton, UT",214,73,11,1.0,1/6/2018,"Do not come here on a Saturday night, totally not worth a 1.5 hour wait for mediocre food or overpriced desserts. They really should get a reservation system or a cell phone alert system.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray
Elijah E.,"South Jordan, UT",3,13,3,3.0,11/25/2017,"I have tried this place many times. Every time that I have gone, I have never liked the food. I have tried many items and they just aren't that good. The noodles taste like plastic and tap water. Not to mention the price is way to high for the quality of the food.  The cheesecake and staff is the best part about this restaurant. The staff is friendly and always doing their best. The cheesecake is also amazing. If you go here, go for the cheesecake.   The atmosphere is not the best. It is way to dark and way to loud. I can't even have a conversation with the person across from me. The lighting is way to dark. I had to use a flashlight to just read the menu. It's not efficient to have the customers struggle to read the menu.  I don't think I will be returning. Every single time I've tried it, the food hasn't been good and the wait is way to long. Food quality is not the best.

I don't recall ever making a reservation but they do have a buzzer system that works from far away. My favorite time to go is on Sundays for brunch. Also if you read the first page on their menu you get a sense odntheir humble beginnings. American classics are offered with a twist. Prices range from $7 for kids to $13 for adults. They have alcohol (bloody Mary, mimosa) and They also have ethic specialties like plantains, southern fried chicken or fish and Italian.

George C.,"Sandy, Salt Lake City, UT",6,94,108,3.0,9/17/2017,"I have been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory for years and I was glad that they finally made their way to Utah. My wife is a fan of their chicken piccata. I know it's a simple dish but they do a really good job with the lemon sauce with capers. I like their kobe burger and the smoke house BBQ burger but I normally go with their lunch pizza (margarita) and salad. I have tried a lot from their menu by try to save room for a cheesecake. I haven't had a bad cheesecake yet or one that I wouldn't order again. Tonight we came in for desert and have their newly updated recipe for carrot cake and I got the Dutch apple caramel streusel. Wow, both were really good. The service has always been great here and Holly tonight was no exception, she did great. And that goes for any Cheesecake Factory that I have ever gone to, the service makes or breaks the dinning experience . The only reason I am give them three stars is for the fact that this has to be one of the smallest and loudest of their restaurants that I have been to. Maybe they didn't think they would be as big as they are in Murray, Utah? The other restaurant in salt lake is a pretty good sized restaurant. But still, it's one of my favorite restaurants to go to.  09/17/2017 Today we came for the brunch and I had their chicken and waffles with eggs Benedict and I'm stuffed and didn't finish my plate. Everything was good except I wasn't a big fan of the maple syrup. It tasted like butterscotch, a bit too sweet for me. My better half had the skinny chicken pasta and she that was pretty good, it looked good.

We walk in and I immediately ask if they were still serving and the hostess replied with a ""yes, we still have a few hours until close"". Perfect! We get seated and we literally just sat there waiting for our server for 10 minutes before someone finally came. He took our drink order, and another 10 minutes past before we see him again. We get to ordering out meal and waited 45 minutes for our meal to be given to us. Mine was half cold, while my friend enjoyed hers. At this point I just want to go home. Anther 10 minutes to get our server to get us the check, another 10 minutes to get our cheesecakes, another 10 minutes to have the server correct a mistake on the bill, another 10 minutes for us to pay....you get the idea.

I ordered the miso salmon with brown rice, the salmon was cooked perfectly and the lunch size was enough to keep me full.

Chantel H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",136,183,271,2.0,9/18/2017,"It's sad more places don't offer vegan/dairy free options, especially with how popular it is becoming. Of the four items considered vegan on the menu (with a menu that is 30 pages you'd think they'd offer a few more), I got Evelyn's favorite pasta which was pretty good. It is full of different vegetables, olive oil, and rigatoni pasta. The waiter brought me out extra olive oil because he knew the dish is pretty dry. There was a ""mix-up"" in the kitchen so my brother had to wait until our food was pretty much finished before he got his meal. My sister ordered gluten free pasta and found many different noodles mixed in with her pasta that was not gluten-free. That was very upsetting for her and resulted in her getting sick. You would think the chefs would be more considerate of someone's dietary needs especially if ordering their meal a certain way. I am never very impressed with Cheesecake Factory.

My boyfriend & I went here with his daughter during Labor Day weekend (Saturday) It was very busy, but surprisingly the wait was not very long. Only 15 minutes. We got there at 1pm. Our server was very offish, cold, bored, over-it. It was hard to read him, just not a very friendly guy but I can understand -maybe he was just very busy. He was however, very attentive & after fixing my bf's drink order from a Diet Coke to a regular Coke we never had to ask for a refill on our drinks or water. He just automatically picked up the glasses & returned with full glasses. So that's good. Our food came to us in a timely manner. Not a very long wait. It also arrived exactly how we requested it.

My friend ordered the avocado egg rolls which were delicious with a nice sweet sauce. I ordered the chicken parmesan pizza style entree which was basically all chicken. It was chicken parm in the shape of a pizza topped with slightly  under-seasoned garlic pasta. Overall it was good, different but good. A little salt on the pasta and it really hit the spot. My friend had the chicken and waffles Benedict which was also really good. The chicken was perfectly fried and the waffle was nice and fluffy.

Doug J.,"Cottonwood Heights, Salt Lake City, UT",2,74,51,3.0,2/24/2017,A solid 3. the food is good but expensive. Not a place to take kids when you have to pay regular prices for them. I ordered the Baja tacos. The flavor was good but you get 4 mini and I mean mini tacos with only 1-2 chunks of chicken per taco. I thought they were appetizers but I was wrong. For $14 I expected at lest real sized tacos. Wife got a $14 bowl of chili. Really good but chili costs $14? For the 4 of us came to $75 includes tip and we all ordered water. I'm sure there are better things but tonight was not it. It will be a while before we go back. (Maybe after I get a raise) Our waitress was really good but when the kitchen brought the food out it was 2 plates at a time with about at 2 minutes in-between.

They have a vast menu that hits anything you could possibly be in the mood for. The Chicken Waffle Benedict is fabulous for brunch. The syrup for the waffle tastes like buttery toffee, it's incredible. I enjoy the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls are fresh and full of flavor. I really enjoy the Fried Macaroni and Cheese, it's the perfect consistency of cheesy goodness with a light panko coating. You can definitely feast on appetizers here. As far as entrees go, you can't go wrong with the Miso Salmon or Chicken Picatta. My sweetheart loves the Cuban Sandwich and he gets it with Sweet Potato Fries. His favorite dessert is Linda's Fudge Cake.

Once seated, our server took a lengthy time in approaching us. However, when she did we immediately put in our order and she was back with drinks and bread in only a few minutes. Appetizers and our entree came out quickly, too! Which was a welcomed sight after our long wait.  We ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls. Pretty good, but they are absolutely MADE by the sweet dipping sauce they serve with the dish. Seriously, we almost ate it by the spoonful.  We ordered the Lemon Garlic Noodles. We added shrimp ($5 extra and they gave us probably 6 small, measly shrimp.) Next time just add chicken. It's cheaper. The noodles are spaghetti, but next time I'd change it for angel hair. The thick noodle seemed odd without a marinara sauce. The garlic sauce is light and buttery. The dish was reminiscent of buttered noodles my mom would make me as a kid. The added asparagus, tomatoes and mushrooms were great.  We finished it off with a slice of their Pumpkin Cheesecake. Seasonal, so get it while it's hot!  Decent meal.

The restaurant wasn't particularly crowded today, besides that they can handle huge crowds at cheesecake factory.  So here are my observations: 1.  Service was slow. It took an unusually long time before we got our main course and again a long time before we got our dessert. It even took a long time to get the bill. 2.  They were out of the desert we ordered, they offered substitutions, we accepted a substitution; however, they made no concessions in terms of a discount on our dessert or on our meal. 3.  At The server's suggestion, we ordered the dinner special and found the portion to be much smaller than the usual main course portions. As I've mentioned in prior reviews, their portions are typically big enough for two people to split.

Pros: Large portions, amazing cheesecake and clean restrooms. Cons: High prices, bad service and long wait times. I am a huge fan of the cheesecake factory chains. Mostly because of the red velvet cheesecake. We arrived this evening around 10 pm (one of the few choices open at 10 pm for a full service meal). There was a 10 minute wait (which we found odd since it was 10 pm and there was no one in the lobby). Once we were seated, we waited 15 min to place our drink order. Our waiter ""forgot"" to bring out bread until after our appetizer was delivered to our table.  We ordered: Pot stickers: Piping hot, crispy and seasoned to perfection! The sauce was addicting! I kept dipping my bread in the sauce. I would definitely order this again. The only con- they only give you 6 small dumplings. So, for the price of $10.95....you are paying for quality not quantity.  Chicken Madeira: This dish was so disappointing! Ice cold, lacking in flavor, gluey cheese and overcooked asparagus!  Disclaimer: We have ordered this dish before at another location and it was wonderful.  We complained to our waiter and expressed our concerns about the dish. He acted annoyed and told us he would get a manager and have it remade. The manager brought out the remake and seemed annoyed with us. She did not even apologize for the mistake. If you are going to pay $18+ for chicken, it should at least be hot! The new one had been microwaved for a few minutes (rubbery!). We basically filled up on bread and pot stickers and took our dessert to go.  BTW: We paid full price for everything, even though they took 25 minutes to replace a messed up item.  Lemon raspberry cheesecake: Out of all of the desserts I have tried at cheesecake factory, this one is by far the sweetest (tastes like pure sugar). I would not get this item again.  Craigs crazy carrot cake cheesecake: Very tasty and not too sweet! This carrot cake had a subtle sweetness and was moist!  Overall I wouldn't come back to this location.

Between 2 or 3 layers of over-sized wonton squares sit chicken breast, mixed greens, pineapples, cucumbers, bell peppers, carrots, green beans, nuts, and more, all dressed in tasty house vinaigrette. Such a delicious combination and it's eye appealing. Now the dessert... I like the cheesecakes with different layers and different textures so my favorite at the moment is the Oreo cheesecake.  They are always busy and weekend dinner times = ridiculous wait times. Despite long waits to get a table, food arrives relatively fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=60

So I took the plate and had one shrimp then did not eat anymore. The shrimp was way over cooked and dried out. Didn't even have a good flavor. I didn't bother telling the waitress.

Jennifer J.,"Draper, UT",145,122,263,2.0,4/9/2015,"We don't typically eat at The Cheesecake Factory; I still remember when it first opened how long the wait times were. But yesterday night, my husband suggested we go there, and I thought it would be a nice change from Olive Garden or McGrath's, where we normally go. They were a bit disorganized with seating people. Rather than using a paging system, the host and hostesses would yell out the name and number of people in a party. They heard me wrong when I gave our last name and said party of three. They were calling our name, but for two, and it took a few extra minutes for them to sort that out. The host was apologetic and friendly, though. It wasn't a big deal, but having worked in a restaurant before, I know that something like that would probably set off a different type of personality and the restaurant workers would get yelled at. Our waitress was Jen, and while she was nice enough, I'm fairly good at reading people. She seemed annoyed, and I'm not sure if it was with us or if she just didn't want to be there at all that night. We all have those days, I know. I ordered the fish and chips with the sweet potato fries and she gave me a ""you're kinda stupid"" look when I asked if there was any other sauce besides ketchup for the sweet potato fries. My options were ketchup and fry sauce. I asked for fry sauce, but I wonder if there are other sauces she could have recommended. Most places have something sweet to go with it, or something with a kick. Either one of those would have complemented the fries better. When it came time to get the check, she gave us another table's check that didn't even closely resemble what we'd ordered. When she dropped the check, that was pretty much the only time we got a huge smile out of her, as well as a ""it was my pleasure serving you tonight"" (which, sorry to say, didn't feel genuine at all.) I had to catch her while she was walking by, or it might have taken us another fifteen to twenty minutes to get the correct check. She wasn't apologetic about giving us the wrong check, and didn't even seem surprised that she had.  I'm sure I'll eat here again, but I'm a bit put off by how pushy the servers are with cheesecake--if you don't want to eat it there, then they try to push you to order it to go--and the lukewarm service we received from the server. I also wish she'd been thoughtful enough to include a container of tartar sauce for my leftover fish and chips. They are going to taste plain without it, as well as soggy, because she also included the coleslaw and only separated that from the rest of my leftovers with a thin piece of paper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=60

He was extremely knowledgable of the menu items and gave good recommendations. There were a few hiccups with getting menus but they quickly fixed the problems.

The tables are really close together!! Not only did I have to yell at the person sitting across from me, I also had the privilege of hearing 3 other conversations of the tables around me since we were pretty much sitting on top of each other.  The staff was pretty rude right from the start. The girls who take your name down were so condescending. We waited almost 15 mins for even a ""hello, would you like some water?"" from our waiter. Menu is way too big!! Maybe it's just me and I believe in the beauty of simple, no nonsense, good eating.  Food is pretty medicore. My husband ordered fries with his hamburger, and the waiter forgot them. When we informed he, he seemed like he didn't care. It took 20 mins after he got his hamburger to get them. I had the carbonara. I have had much better for a better price.  I think the waiter only checked on us once after the fries and that was to ask if we wanted to order dessert!

Curtis C.,"Lehi, UT",163,430,81,2.0,9/8/2015,"Another friends birthday, another visit to the Cheesecake Factory, another disappointment.  This time I went with a Mac and cheese burger, fries, and a side of both the buffalo sauce and chipotle mayo. We were in a group of 11, so of course it took a while. While waiting for food I had a hibiscus lemonade that was actually really good. It was $5, but with unlimited refills and the option to switch it for raspberry or strawberry I found it worth it. The food eventually made its way out and I began the meal. The burger was okay, but I've had much better Mac & Cheese Burgers for less money and less of a wait. The real reason I have to ding this place down to two stars is the fries. When I'm paying ~$25 after tip for a lemonade, burger and fries, every element of the meal better be excellent. The lemonade passed, I'll let the burger slip by with a pass, but the fries...the fries...the first thought when eating them was wonder at how old they must have been. I ate a few, from the top, then the middle, and then the bottom, all in hopes that I could find one worth eating. I never found one.  Eventually I offered fries to friends just to see what their thoughts were. The reactions were, ""old"", ""gross"", and my personal favorite....""these taste like fries that you left in the car and then tried a couple of hours later and regret"" Much like old car fries, I regret this meal. I've tried a decent variety of things here and only found a handful that weren't awful. Maybe 1 or 2 that were good, but in the end, regardless of what I eat, I think to myself, ""why didn't I go to that local place that makes a better version of this meal for less cost and less time?""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=80

In addition, my co worker and I were joined by several flies.  I counted nine at one point.  I'm not sure if these flies came in when the doors were open, but they were desperately trying to get out using the window at our booth.  After many attempts to escape, they refueled their bodies with microscopic portions of our meals.  Or, just left us gifts of exhaustion.

Avocado egg rolls or factory chicken nachos are the best appetisers.

Zuhadi Z.,"Draper, UT",268,192,427,4.0,6/8/2015,"I was in the mood for pasta and my friend conveniently recommended Chicken Jambalaya Pasta. I heard this is the dish she always order every time she is in Cheesecake Factory. So I thought, well, worth a try, and boy was she right. It was so good I wanted to give her a hug. Heck, I even wanted to give The Chef a hug.   The chicken was tender and juicy. The cajun spices were spicy enough to add zing to my taste buds without overdoing it. Ok spicy is not actually a taste but a form of pain, which then confirms when people say there is always pleasure in a little bit of pain. The pasta was done in perfection. The shrimp was tasty and together with blends of vegetables (onions, tomatoes and green peppers with parsley sprinkles), they complete this whole heavenly dish.  I would give a 5-stars review if I had not made to wait over an hour to get our table on that Saturday evening. I know that is the busiest time of the week, and I don't mind the wait but we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get the bread served (and another 20 minutes to get our orders).  At least, they should serve the bread right away after we were seated since everybody was surely starving after all that long wait.

The only tip is to come on Sunday, whereby there are not as many people, so you do not need to queue very long. So we came here the last time for Sunday lunch. The price is cheaper because the portion is smaller. We need to understand that their ""lunch"" portion is still pretty large & comparable to other restaurant. Their dinner portion is gigantic. They provide bread for appetizer. There are two types of bread (chocolate one and normal one). I prefer the chocolate color one (it does not taste like chocolate, but it is still delicious) with butter. The waiter is very kind and providing another one, after we ate them out in 5 min ... (yes, it is that good). I got fish & chips that I shared with my six-year-old boy, both of us like it. It is crispy with 3 pieces of fish and fries. It filled both of us.

Now my wife and I arrived before 5:00, so obviously our wait time was long enough for them to grab menus, and our service was above average, and we didn't wait too long for food, which tasted amazing.

Why not play some classical music?? Your cheesecake is still amazing! But tell me am I suppose to drive 45 min away to get my pasta that you forgot? You obviously don't know what customer service is, too expensive for what you get, and strip mall quality environment. You are obviously ripping people off. So why not give back that money and get your act together. Try to bring back a touch of class. You have lost my service and respect as a business.. makes me sad cause you were my go to place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=140
Chloe H.,"Lebanon, OH",183,16,2,3.0,2/15/2016,"Being President's Day, we decided to get there early, and we were glad we did! For a party of two our wait was still an hour, but we expected this to be the case. Luckily the mall attached has some great stores. Our waiter was great, extremely friendly and accommodating. After perusing the 50 page spiral-bound menu, we finally made our decisions. About half an hour after we ordered, the complementary bread came. Long wait, but at least the bread was warm. Shortly after we received our appetizer - the factory nachos. Holy massive plate of food batman! Unfortunately, the chips were grease-laden....literally dripping in oil, and the cheese was hard and coagulated, and also incredibly greasy. On the bright side, the guacamole tasted fresh and the pico de gallo was pleasant. Four chips in and we were already full. When our entrees finally came, the California Guacamole Superfood Salad had to be sent back because the order was incorrect, but the waiter was accommodating and friendly about it. Once the right salad came, overall I didn't have any complaints. It wasn't anything that would wow you, but at least it was fresh. My husband ordered the Factory Burrito, I believe it was called. It was literally 14 inches long and 5 inches wide, so he of course was initially thrilled at how much food there was. However, the burrito ended up being a soggy mess of a tortilla smothered in tepid red sauce and wrapped around a massive, mushy mound of flavored rice. Unfortunate. I will say though, both of us agreed that the endless lemonade was fantastic. It's too bad they changed their policy and don't let you change flavors once you order.  When we asked for our check, the waiter looked sad and asked if everything was alright, looking and the vast array of food still left on our plates. Of course we told him it was okay, we were just full. Since we were paying with gift cards, we weren't about to complain about leaving with full stomachs and wallets. We also got some Oreo cheesecake to go.  Overall, it was your typical chain restaurant experience. An extensive menu and huge portions typically means low-caliber food, so we weren't surprised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=140

D. W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",798,1410,,3.0,4/26/2015,"Salt Lake City has grown up a lot, in a culinary sense and nowhere is this more in abundance than this chain electing to finally land in this market. The city, in addition to badly needing an enema, also needs more upscale chains like this. The interior was nearly spot-on to a lot of the East coast locations I've hit up and the only flaw I could find was the black coating peeling back on every one of the benches. Despite it being jammed, this location was also the least amount of time I've ever waited to be seated at any of their restaurants. It's overall borderline artsy and tasteful and apropos for the lofty pretensions this chain has for itself. This is a very good representative restaurant of that, overall.  This extends to the food itself. Tons of alcoholic drinks on the menu and their annoying habit of including the Sunday-only stuff in the regular menu, but refusing to make any of it, unless you happen to be there on that day. That menu is extensive, but mostly a hodge-podge of standard Americana stuff, along with a bevy of questionable fusion ideas executed mostly poorly. The hallmark of this chain, to me, is that everything, including the cheesecake, is one note off. This extends to the Coke Zero mix, to the soy ginger, remoulade, Thai peanut and Dynamite mayo sauce, to the ""tempura"" batter on the shrimp and on down. The warm bread basket was nice and the bread was flavorful. This, along with the perfectly done fries, was probably the best part of the entire thing. The shrimp batter tasted slightly off and refused to go nicely with any of those 4 sauces I mentioned. The Cuban rolls was an intriguing idea; combining a Cubano into a spring roll. In execution, though, it's basically like they stuck everything in to a blender, stuffed it into a rice wrapper and fried it to death. This also refused to go with sauces, but the idea of a Cubano, when done well, is that it wouldn't need to. In case it's not clear, this was not done well. The mango key lime cheesecake was another disaster. Topped with artificial sugar whip, gloppy mango syrup, incredibly overdone key lime flavoring and next to no actual cheesecake taste, then mounted on a crust with bits of coconut that was itself a dense, overly thick chunky mess, it nearly defied eating. In fact, I bailed on it well before the end. This is a place I meant to get to since it opened and while it took longer than expected for the stars to align both with me having opportunity and the lines dying down, I finally made it and now it's done, probably never to be repeated again. Given that it will typically be busy (wait line was out the door when we left), know going in this place will be rather loud and service will be very put upon and performance will drop accordingly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=160

Garrett N.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,77,7,4.0,7/16/2015,"I've always liked Cheesecake Factory. It just seems to be one of those places that fits any ""special"" occasion, whether it be a birthday, graduation, or a family reunion. In addition to its eclectic decor and snappily dressed staff, the restaurant's menu boasts more items than a Vegas buffet with a smorgasbord of dessert choices (not limited to cheesecake). This time we went for my wife's birthday and there were 7 of us in tow. I am always anxious about going to restaurants in large groups as I tend to be the one on top of things who knows what he wants and knows that the sooner everyone orders, the sooner everyone is feasting. My sentiments do not seem to be universally (or even commonly) acknowledged, yet the staff at The Cheesecake Factory was helpful, patient, and responsive. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce. It was delicious but no better than what you'd expect at a sit-down restaurant. My wife had the salmon spring rolls and shrimp summer spring rolls. She initially ordered the ahi tartare (all of these items are on the Skinnylicious menu), but they were out of tuna. Odd for 4 pm on a Wednesday, but she decided on the rolls instead. She loved both of them. The rest of the orders were similarly enjoyed (eggplant Parmesan [huge!], margarita pizza, herb-crusted salmon, steak medallions, and chicken bellagio). We also ordered seven slices of various cheesecakes, and there were no complaints there. The lovely waitress was cordial, quick with the drink and bread refills, and helpful to the finish.

Kimberly L.,"Sandy, UT",1,3,,1.0,9/28/2015,"I have never given any restaurant one star, but the Cheesecake Factory in Murray is very deserving of a one star review  My husband and I went to Cheesecake for dinner because we had $100 in gift cards there. We paid for our $44 meal, only to find out that they lost our gift card before they ran it, leaving our meal unpaid for. We sat for an hour and a half, waiting for some action to be taken. Finally, the manager said that she was sorry they lost our $100 gift card, and ""we would just have to take our losses."" After we explained that we thought that was very unacceptable that they weren't willing to replace what was left on our gift card, she said the best she could do was give us a $25 gift card, and it would come out of our waiters pocket.  Wow. Just wow. Our waiter looked tirelessly for our gift card, and was stellar at taking care of us. I find it awful that a SENIOR manager would ever be so unwilling to replace our gift cards, and then later say she would do it at the expense of her own employee!!  After some discussion, she gave my husband the $25 gift card, and he called to see the balance of the card. It was zero-- in fact she had never even activated card, which the employee on the phone told us must happen in order to add money on the card. So not only this SENIOR MANAGER refuse to replace our gift cards initially, and later said she would give us $25 after losing $100, but she never even put money of the gift card!!  I'm extremely disappointed in the management and cannot believe that they would treat customers like that. We will definitely never be going to Cheesecake Factory ever again, and will be sure to share this story freely with everyone and anyone that wants to hear it.

This happens about 4 times a year. I have never had a bad server, they are always professional waitstaff. I assume this is because of the average price per plate.  This last time we ordered off the Sunday brunch menu and I had a fabulous crab hash and my husband had a sinful French toast sammich of doom.  Of course both were amazing. I was a little annoyed by some burned peppers in the hash but it was overcome by yummy poached eggs and real chunks of crab.  The decor is dated and very Las Vegas but who really cares as long as it's clean and the food is good?  One beef I have is the community seating. I HATE the long bench and the tiny tables spaced out by a foot. It's really difficult for the servers, it's gross to be so close to strangers when you're eating and quite frankly whoever invented it has probably never had the flu.  But I've learned to tell them up front to seat me at a booth and that I'm fine waiting. Though I've never waited at this location.

Andrew S.,"Riverton, UT",160,382,102,3.0,12/1/2012,"You have to admire any chain restaurant that will outright admit to being a factory that mass produces food items.  Sure, we know this is the case with all chains, but heck I'm going to give them a pass on this and one other factor - they do really have cheesecake (as is also suggested in their name) and plenty of it! I've been to the Cheesecake Factory maybe 3 times.  And it has always been okay, but not really anywhere I can say I am likely to actually choose to go of my own volition, I've only really been for group or family events.  In fact my criteria for going is simple: 1. Someone else is paying. 2. I can get a couple of bites of cheesecake mixed into my dining experience. 3. (And most important) - If it prevents any chance of having to visit the Olive Garden I'll throw all other criteria straight out of the window. So with the stage now set, I can say that today's visit really was not too bad.  What I do know about this chain is the portions are HUGE, so I generally order the 'lunch' items, which are more moderate portions if your definition of that is a medium sized banquet.  And of those, the meat loaf is the best one in my experience, it is actually pretty darn good and ultimately why they get 3 stars here.  Fish and Chips is definitely somewhat MEH - so avoid if that's the fix you are looking for! I also must say, I'm a fan of Cheesecake, however deserts in general are also a fan of my waste line so I try to avoid as much as possible.  But the ones I've tried here, particularly the seasonal and specialty ones do hit the spot.  Peppermint candy cheesecake anyone?  Yummy.  Lot better than it sounds! Service was very friendly, and overall prompt considering how busy it was, certainly nothing too much to complain about here.  The overall ambiance is also pretty good - if I have one complaint - it's that the music can be a little too loud and overwhelming at times.  I'm not however going to take a star for that, I tend to be a bit of an audiophile, and I think that, combined with age is making me somewhat sensitive about what I tend to consider 'irritating' background noise.  For the younger crowd it could be great. If you've never been, definitely give it a try.  Just beware of those portions if you're on any type of diet (and I suspect, not just portions, but all the other food pyramid busting goodness lovingly cooked in at the factory!!!!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=160

As for the food, I truly believe they wanted to bring out your indecisiveness with the excessive number of items on their menu.  Every time I came here, their menu always overwhelmed me, and it took numerous processes of eliminations to figure out what I want to order.   If you are limited budget, I would recommend their Sunday Brunch, it actually has more food than dinner for lower price, and I personally enjoyed their Egg Benedict.  It is healthy, delicious, and I sure love a perfectly poached egg. For dinner appetizer, I would go for the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll.  It is not exactly a traditional Japanese dish, more like a Chinese-Japanese fusion with western plating, which to my surprise turned out very well.  Crunchy like egg rolls with texture like sushi~   The portion is huge, you may consider substituting that for the main course. For those that just want to get a salad, I recommend the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.  The fish and fresh vegetable just went well together.  For the actual main course, I would go for the Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna.  I could not tasted any spiciness in the wasabi, but the crust goes very well with the tuna, and the miso sauce rice underneath seem to go well with the dish overall.  I do believe they need to enhance the wasabi flavor more. Now for the bad...  the steak is pretty bad here, I never had a single good experience with their meat dishes here.  They seem to have a tendency of overcooking them with poor seasoning... bland is the word I would use to describe them.   The pasta is next bad choice I experienced here.  I tried the Shrimp with Angel Hair and it was painfully flavorless.  I would however recommend the Thai Chicken Pasta, which was delicious.  Other dishes I tried tasted pretty average. Cheesecakes are also hit or miss, the Tiramisu and Wild Blueberry cheesecakes were very good, but ones like Cherry, Key Lime, Pumpkin, and the Low Carb ones were very hard and bland.

Boy were we wrong! First we ordered our food then the power went out, which is fine, things happen. We sat in the dark for about 45 minutes before our waitress came up and told us that our food wasn't going to be able to be made. I don't know why it took so long for them to tell us. Because by the time they came out and finally told us, all other restaurants were closed and we couldn't have dinner anywhere. To top it off instead of comping our future meal to come back another time to compensate for what happened, they told us that if we wanted to, we could BUY some cheesecake! I asked to speak with the manager and our waitress went to get her. She never came. So I asked the person at the front desk to speak with the manager and they said that the general manager of both stores was there and asked if I wanted to speak with her, I said enthusiastically yes that would be even better. We waited for about 15 minutes and she never came but instead after 15 more minutes of waiting, kid came out from the back and told us to choose 1 piece of cheesecake to share between the two of us for free. We didn't want cheesecake, we want to dinner. We were starving by then.  I asked if they would comp a future meal for us to make up for all the waiting and no food and they said no.

Sky T.,"Melbourne, FL",137,213,554,5.0,7/19/2011,"Okay, I may be a little bias but I love The Cheesecake Factory. I, Sky Thai, LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. Absolutely love, love, love it. Maybe because my favorite dessert is cheesecake and it's part of the name and I loved everything I ever had here. (Not to mention that many memories of birthdays and friend's birthdays were held here.) Not sure why I love it so, but I love The Cheesecake Factory. I think if I were a restaurant, I would be The Cheesecake Factory. Best chain restaurant in existence. LOVE IT! - - - - - - - - - - Anyways back from my fanboy moment, it has a slightly elegant but comfortable and relaxing feel that just works to bring the best of the upscale and comfort of a lowscale together in harmony. What more can you ask for? The lunch specials are seriously good for what they get you and are so very delicious and yum-yum good. The dinners are the same way and you get a hefty, tantalizing portion of whatever you order. They like to pretty up the tasty food so big points for plating design. (You do know you eat with your eyes first.) I have not had anything bad here and I don't expect to but hey, if you have a problem with the meal they will get another one for you at no cost. That's what they did for a friend of mine and that's what I call good customer service. Yes, it is crowded in the evenings and the waits can be atrociously long but go on the ""off days"" (Sunday-Thursday) in the afternoon or early evening to get a seat. If all else fails, just go shopping at the Fashion Place Mall or at some other store nearby to kill time until the wait ""should"" be over. You just gotta play the waiting game sometimes but I think it is worth it. Oh, and how could I forget about the cheesecake itself? In a nutshell, there is a huge assortment and array of the decadently guilty pleasure. I am pretty sure you will find something that appeals to your wanting tastebuds.

The breakfast food looked pretty, but was well beyond dismal: my California Omelette was virtually tasteless (including the fresh avocado -- ??), the cubed breakfast potatoes, with their only flavor being ""burnt,"" landed somewhere between gluey-chewy and rock-hard. The coffee, including all two refills, was lukewarm. The scrambled eggs were rubbery. The fresh-squeezed orange juice and the hot chocolate, however, both received loud praises.  Our waiter was the only truly flawless part, with his Osmondesque smile, and his delightful personality. No missteps on his part at all - he worked his butt off for us. He even quickly fetched the Manager when things went South, so he could come out and apologize personally. He also comp'd one meal that took forever coming out. The two stars are for the service.

There were two issues - the wait was atrocious and since it was a bit cold outside, everyone just stood inside elbow to elbow, with people walking in between everyone trying to get their name in or just leave after eating. The second issue I had was the proximity of our table to other tables. I went here with a buddy and we could hear almost word for word the conversations on both sides of us.

Valeen A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,19,1,3.0,3/15/2015,"The menu items taste exactly the same as every Cheesecake Factory restaurant. I admire their consistency in taste- they have great quality control. Nothing here will taste bad and you will have the exact same dining experience every time you eat here. Unfortunately, this means that it will be very loud and noisy, and service will be super slow. There's a reason why their menu is 20,000 pages long- to give you something to read while you wait, and wait.  And wait. Sitting in the bar, or going here super late at night will earn you no reprieve- you have slow service even after 9 pm.   To be fair, no one seems to notice the slow service much. Parties are raucous and boisterous and having a good time. Lots of parties of women celebrating impending nuptials, or birthdays. But if you are desperate, I suggest you order a bunch of appetizers. They come out a tad faster, and no matter which appetizer you order, the quality will be good and the taste will be fine.  I suggest this place for large parties with a lot of time to kill. The extensive menu will guarantee something for everyone, and you won't notice the wait if you have lots of news to shout about across the table. If you're still sober at the end of the night, I recommend examining the decor. It's lush and over the top and completely disproportionate to most other restaurants in Salt Lake City which have more spartan settings.

I've mentioned this before, but I still have yet to try cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory.  I know it seems wrong, but after the tremendously long wait, I have a tendency to down my food fairly quickly and find myself far too full to have cheesecake.  Or... in those rare cases when I'm having a huge sweet tooth craving, I get Linda's Fudge Cake.  I know, it seems wrong, but haven't you ever seen Matilda when Miss Trunchbull makes the fat kid devour a huge chocolate cake?  Well, this cake is what I imagine that cake tasted like, I just prefer eating it in smaller quantities.   Maybe one of these days I'll see what the big hype is over the cheesecake?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=200

Jennifer K.,"Cottonwood Heights, Salt Lake City, UT",0,60,3,1.0,11/6/2015,"I have visited this cheesecake factory location at least 8 times this year, after the first visit it was never my choice again. I dont know why this location is so popular/crowded. just the fact that its connected to a busy mall? It's a huge chain? Other locations are fine but I dont see how such a dirty place with terrible service, neglectful and avoidant staff can have so much business!   EVERY time we've gone they seat us at a table with bits of food on the chairs and table (pet peeve). Time before last I stepped in a pile of rice on the floor. The time before that a glass was dropped and broken by a server, she asked a busy busser to take care of it but he didnt even hear her cause he was soooo busy! When she came back to the area and saw it still hadn't been cleaned up she just threw a napkin on top of the broken glass and liquid, walked away and started giggling with a coworker in the back corner. These shards of glass were on the ground for almost our entire meal. I was actually concerned about a toddler who was running back and forth by all the glass, but no one else seemed to notice or care.  They have no problem serving with dirty glassware and silverware. I am always so surprised by how terrible the service and quality of food is, especially since the place is often packed and ridiculously overpriced for the quality of food. They seem to have an abundance of staff but they rarely want to go to their tables. I have watched with my own eyes as servers hurriedly walk back and forth up and down and looked extremely busy, but they weren't doing anything! They were seemingly powerwalking to random corners of the restaurant, shuffling around some glasses or just standing at card readers then they'd rush to another side for some more shuffling and the illusion of being too busy to wait on their table.  Finally, the last time my guy made me go he ordered one of his favorite entrees (chicken and biscuits...that dish is WHY he wants to eat here) When his entree arrived and he tried to put his fork into the biscuits they were so hard that one biscuit repelled the fork, flew off the plate and sounded like a rock when it landed! He waited for our server to come back, he just wanted to replace the biscuit but after about ten minutes he resigned to not having any biscuits. She NEVER came back to check our food, refill our glasses or do her job at all until she decided we needed our check. We showed her the biscuit and she blew it off like, how was I supposed to know? It was completely inedible, like fossilized dinodroppings. She asked if he wanted another, he said he didnt want to risk it and he was done with his chicken, he said he would have taken one earlier but she never came back. I requested for her to bring some biscuits anyway. A few minutes later someone else with crazy person  makeup came with biscuits and said she heard about the rock biscuit and hoped it didn't happen again. She didn't offer any compensation. In everyone's opinion, if you have to pay nearly twenty dollars for everything on the menu then the food should be at least edible, period. Quality control is not an unattainable mystery.

I have visited this location maybe 3 times in the past 2 years, most recently today! The wait is always long. I was surprised that there is still a huge line out the door even though they have been open for some time now. We opted to sit at the bar where we found 3 seats readily available and enjoyed some great lunch conversation and hijincks with some older gentlemen sitting off to our left. The bartenders gave us exceptional service the entire time and were attentive and talkative, but not overbearing in their recommendations. I feel like the menu at Cheesecake Factory is incredibly overwhelming with too many choices and the ads especially bug me, but the dishes I have tried are delicious and prepared well. My favorite is the lunch portion (which is still enormous) of the pasta da vinci. I also like the stuffed mushrooms on the small plates menu and the passion iced tea is flavorful.  I never order cheesecake because the slices are humongous and the calories in one are probably two days worth of your daily allowance, but it looks very, very delectable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=220

The experience:  when we got there, there was an hour wait (at 6 om on a Saturday night).  I was amazed because it is a chain and the night was young.  But, knowing the food crisis in UT (nothing is good, really!)- I understand.  This is why I removed 1 star- no one should wait an hour for a chain restaurant at only 6pm.  Thankfully, we were able to find seating at the bar right away. This is where the service magic happened.  We were greeted immediately, even with the crowd.  The bartender & an assistant were attentive, funny and helpful.  Our food- chicken madiera & steak diane- was the usual quality/taste/etc which is a blessing (yes blessing- it is Mormon country folks).  The bartender made a custom drink to my bf's request & did so confidently and kindly.  I had the apple martini.  The highlight- we substituted well liquor for top shelf (Chopin Vodka & Grand Marnier) and we were not charged extra for this nor for the unique custom drink.

My first misconception was that the hype was all about cheesecake and not food.  But one look over their humongous menu lets you know they aren't just a place for desert.  Seriously find the menu online, it's 20 pages long! I got the Steak Diane, steak medallions in a mushroom wine sauce, basically my favorite dish so I figured it's a good measuring stick for restaurants.  It was delicious, maybe a bit peppery but not much more than other places that advertise a black peppercorn Angus steak. The portions are huge, it's best to just plan ahead and divide the dish in half and eat the rest for lunch the next day.  Especially if you have desert, if you eat it all you will be over-stuffing yourself way beyond the safe comfort/health point.  During the long wait for a table you'll notice everybody walking out with huge bags of take-home leftovers. Speaking of the long wait.  I was there on a Thursday and waited 45 minutes; this is considered a short wait here.  You cannot reserve ahead of time so stop by, get your name down, and then try to find something to keep you occupied for the next hour or so. This is also an awful place to have a conversation, the noise level really is out of control.  You have to shout to be heard over the rest of the diners which just leads to an even louder restaurant.  Considering how many people are packed in it's not really surprising why this happens. The service is also average, the waiters and waitresses are working a full speed but there are just so many people to take care of that you'll only see them a couple times during the night.  They're friendly but don't expect them to be attentive to your every need while dining.  I prefer they stay out of my way anyway so this wasn't a big deal to me. Overall I don't plan on going back there unless it's on somebody else's whim.  It's not the food isn't great, I really liked it; it's just not the atmosphere I want in a dining experience.  Dinner is where you go to talk before or after doing something with family friends or loved ones.  Cheesecake Factory is like a loud, rowdy, communal dining experience.  The decor may be a bit fancier, but I don't feel like I'm spending intimate face to face time with people here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=260

When we told her we needed an extra minute to decide what to eat, she took 20 more minutes to come back and check if we were ready to order. I ended up getting the Teriyaki Chicken, it's my fave. It took 30 minutes for our food to come out. I started eating and couldn't help but notice that the rice was rock hard, the chicken tasted off, and there was hardly any sauce. It honestly tasted like it had been sitting around for a while. The restaurant was just really unorganized and nothing was going right. The couple next to us waited 45 minutes for their food.

K J.,"Murray, UT",8,58,,2.0,7/31/2008,"First visit impressions: Like said before here - pretty much like other huge chain restaurants. Food is flavorful and handsomely prepared. Waiter was very nice and helpful in assisting us with our selections. Portions are indeed gigantic! I believe I witnessed EVERYONE leaving the restaurant with a bag. I was no exception, and I only ordered a salad. I was stuffed after eating only 1/2  the meal. It was good enough to think I might eat some more of it the next day. (More than 1/2 the folks I watched leave the place were packing around several dozen previous meals on their hips and waists.) I have to say too that the screaming kids were annoying and the wait time was ridiculous. The herding of patrons in the seating process is reminiscent of an attraction at Disney World. Our waiter said they hadn't switched over to the 1.5 oz. liquor metering yet so I opted out of the $7.50 Mojito. $7.50 is just WAY too much to pay for only 1 oz. of juice in a drink. After the meal I was too full for any desert. Our waiter told us you can buy some of the cheesecakes (all made in California and shipped frozen) at Costco for cheaper than you can get them at the restaurant. So, if you want to avoid the trough-feeding experience and just get a cheesecake it may be a good idea to try out Costco.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=280

When i was at home this weekend, my mom said she really liked The Cheesecake Factory and wanted to have lunch there.  So, being the obedient son, I went with her.   They have these all over California, and I have never set foot in one.  The ambiance of the place is reminiscent of any large chain restaurant.  However, this one has really high ceilings giving it a really nice, open feel to it.  The one thing that I noted that was nice was that they had a partition that went from floor to ceiling (half of it being glass) that separated the kitchen from the dining area.  I thought that was really nice because often the kitchen area can get a bit loud.  I ordered the half turkey sandwich, salad, and soup lunch, and my mom got the miso glazed salmon.  The portions are really large here, so be prepared to come with your appetite like I did.  The soup was black bean and actually fairly tasty, the sandwich was on a baguette and really nice and crispy, and the salad had a nice vinaigrette on it.  I tasted my mom's salmon and the glaze was actually decent, but she found it a little bland and had to add some more salt and pepper.   Becky, our server, was good about checking up on us and gave me refills quickly.   Also, of note, there's a full bar here, too.  Not sure if you have to a membership, or not, but probably can just head in after a hard day of shopping at the mall.  ;-p Overall, a decent first-time visit to The Cheesecake Factory.  Would I return, probably not, but overall a decent experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=280

David K.,"San Francisco, CA",49,18,,1.0,7/19/2009,"Cheesecake factory is nothing but pure disappointment.  Over the past three years, I've been to three different Cheesecake Factories around Colorado and Utah.  Every time my food and my wife's food has been gross, period.  Here's some examples: sticky and hard pasta that was way overcooked and raw (and not in a good way) tuna.  I'm not sure what the appeal of this overpriced chain is, but after our last visit we said never ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=300
Hola M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,1,,2.0,4/23/2012,"I've had prior experiences with parties for 2-4 without reservations and been sat within 30 minutes without any problems. However, we had a large group this past Saturday and had made reservations for our party of 18. We called three hours prior to our arrival time and added 4 people to our original party so 22. They said that it would be an hour longer wait time. We said fine and told everyone we would be sat at 7:30 PM instead of 6:30 PM. We all arrived by 7:00 PM. We did not get sat down until 9:00 PM, despite our reservation and confirmation!! Worst service, they did not apologize, they did not offer any explanation, just said that the other party prior to us had not left yet, then what would they have done had we had our original plan. The food is good, the cheesecake is okay. The service at the host stand is awful. The ladies look like they would rather be somewhere else. They are not helpful.  So, the moral is, if you have a 2-4 top, you'll be fine, but don't EVER plan a family or work celebration because they are not equipped to handle it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=300
Jason K.,"Collierville, TN",57,281,1,4.0,12/13/2009,"Yes, it is a national chain, and yes, there is always a long line...this location is no different than others around the country. I marvel at how much money this place must rake in. However, at the same time, we always enjoy our visits here, that is, when our blood pressures can take battling all the other hungry customers. Service is very friendly, but ultimately you do feel that they are trying to move you along so they can seat the next customers. The food is the main attraction, or rather, the voluminous quantity of it. Prices are not cheap, but the selection is huge and they do most choices quite well. Usually, we are not able to save enough room for desert, but sometimes we splurge and take a slice of their wonderful cheesecake home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-murray?start=300
