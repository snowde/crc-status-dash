Jamie R.,"Elmhurst, IL",3,15,41,4.0,12/26/2017,"ah! the cheesecake factory. home of the cheesecakes and tasty variety of food!  tonight started off with some yummy bread & lemonade! the lemonade cup had the top rimmed with sugar, but i was very thirsty and found the lemonade to be a bit tangy instead of refreshing but i was so thirsty i had to drink 3 cups of it!  we also got the truffle bacon grilled cheese which was so so good and literally heaven in my mouth.  i ordered the fried mac n cheese & fries! the fried mac n cheese is soooo good & really creamy when you bite into it. they're also sitting in a type of sauce that seems to be a type of marinara sauce but it's sweeter and lighter. the fries were really good too but the bowl of fries were bigger than i had thought they would but was still priced well enough for what they were. unfortunately, i got really full with eating bread & the truffle bacon grilled cheese sticks, so i'm going to bring food home to eat later! along with a vanilla bean cheesecake which sounds amazing!   would come here again a million times because there's a great variety of food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook
Ellen M.,"Oak Park, IL",454,1259,161,3.0,1/7/2018,"People just love this place, especially out of town friends, and I can never understand it. Fortunately, they have avocado toast, so I'll always be ok. Amazingly, they serve cuisine from a number of ethnicities, but with...well, suburban American flair. Most plates look appealing enough. Everything is very salty though, and I get the impression that there's not a lot of fresh ingredients in the kitchen.  The first thing they want to know is what overpriced wine you'd like. It smacks of efficiency; corporate food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook
Melissa K.,"Downers Grove, IL",46,68,5,3.0,1/1/2018,"Definitely your typical Cheesecake factory location- Nothing out of the ordinary.  I've consistently had decent servers who know a great deal about the cheesecakes and the giant menu- which is surprising, but good. I have to note, and I think this is a constant at all cheesecake factories, the lighting is absolutely horrible. I'm not sure what type of ambiance they're going for, but it's one short step above dining in the dark.  Food is decent, the portions are out of control large, and the cheesecake is a must.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook
Nina H.,"Chicago, IL",2,20,14,1.0,1/5/2018,So we're going on 90 minutes of waiting after being told that the wait was 50 minutes!

Sherry P.,"Romeoville, IL",37,90,241,3.0,1/1/2018,"Great service at The Cheesecake Factory but mediocre food. The calamari was fresh and very tasty. The soup however was croutons and shredded cheese for French onion. Also, not many onions at all and not much flavor. The kids meal looked delicious and chicken was moist. The four cheese pasta was okay. It was edible but nothing I'd want again. It was room temperature, noodles were very hard and the taste just wasn't all that great. Strawberry shortcake for dessert was not sweet at all. It was lacking a syrup or flavor to the shortcake. It was very dry. Nothing was awful, but wouldn't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook
Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",668,491,62,5.0,11/16/2017,"AH, the good old cheesecake factory. This place is something special, with it's 300 + menu items and 60 deserts+drinks, it's unbeatable in food choice. LITERALLY something for everyone.  I came here for a casual dinner with my boyfriend. We both had the baja chicken tacos. I was kind of upset though. Their normally huge portions - the bang for your buck menu - is no longer! These tacos used to be huge and now there's literally four two-bite tacos that barely fed me! They were still extremely delicious though. We also had Mai Thai's and of course the chocolate bread was on point per usual. Staff was also great as always and manager Kim V. was full of energy and happily walking around making sure all the guests (including us!) were happy by coming to our table after the first few bites and checking on the quality of our food.

Melinda C.,"Bloomington, IN",136,57,47,4.0,11/6/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. When I think of big chains, I usually think a loss of quality, but this was not the case. The quality was great, the service was good, and the food was delicious. What I was most surprised by was the options on the menu. There was just about anything you could want to choose from.  We got some drinks at the bar before while we waited, these were also very good. The wait was shorter than anticipated too which is nice.

Michelle T.,"North Riverside, IL",1524,211,817,4.0,6/29/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory, a great franchised American staple that everyone knows and loves! Sure portion sizes aid in the epidemic of obesity and ordering a cheesecake for dessert will push you over the Richter scale of gluttony but that's what doggie bags are for! I have one dish I am infatuated with and get nearly every time I come here. That is, the Jamaican Blackened Pepper Shrimp! Dear Lord, everything on this plate goes so well with together. Platanos, black beans, white rice, pineapple salsa, shrimp, and amazing spicy black pepper sauce that will have you dipping bread in it until every last drop is gone! If you haven't tried this yet, please order it!  Some of my other favorites include: -Tex Mex Eggrolls as an appetizer  -SkinnyLicious Shrimp Summer Rolls (my only dislike is that they're not rolled tight enough and sometimes the ingredients fall out into the dipping sauce.) -Orange Chicken  -Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta  Dessert favorites include: -Godiva Cheesecake  -Chocolate Mouse Cheesecake  *Whipped Cream is everything!

There was a little wait to order our meal but the food arrived faster than expected and our server made sure we didn't run out of bread. The dishes were tasty but not spectacular. The food that was supposed to be hot was and the cold food was chilled just right. My water wasn't refilled as quickly as I like, my son had to remind the waiter to bring his soda, and also the dressing for his fries. It was a good meal.

Mario T.,"Chicago, IL",13,2,1,3.0,12/8/2017,Don't come in and order a burger/cheeseburger well done becuase they will over cook it. It looked good on the outside as soon as I tried cutting into it I knew it wasn't right. I tried eating a piece of it and it was tough. It's sad when I could walk into a wing place and they make better burgers regardless of how you order it. My Gf's chicken looked a bit undercooked which is why I stay away from chicken plates. Their ridiculously huge menu is 80% chicken. At least the ambience and service were good and the manager did right when I complained.

Melanie C.,"Chicago, IL",265,72,127,4.0,3/20/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a family favorite. There's so much on the menu. There's something for everyone.  Waitresses are always pretty happy and welcoming even though they have a lot on their plate (hehe)  Speaking of plates, the portions here are pretty huge which compensates for the prices. Some things are kind of overpriced (like the mex fusion or Asian fusion stuff) but it's a treat for people that don't have a lot of authentic restaurant in the area. To start, the whole wheat bread is pretty good.. it gives a five star based on the theory of ""judge a restaurant by the free bread"".  The calamari is probably the best I've had. It's lightly breaded and I don't get the feeling that it's frozen. So good, I'd be deceived if the tartar sauce or cocktail sauce is homemade.  Entree wise, I usually get the chicken and shrimp gumbo cuz it's creamy, tomato-y, spicyish from the andouille sausage. Something I rarely find in the Midwest.  This place is the epitome of an American restaurant and I'm glad is a pretty solid chain restaurant.  I'm also not a cheesecake junky. I just come for the food. I bet the cheesecake is really good. My sister always gets the Oreo supreme and never shares.  I only knock off stars for the overcrowdedness being next to a mall :(.. a fourty min wait is wack.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook

Ramiro O.,"Chicago, IL",0,23,14,5.0,12/29/2017,"Massive portions and you can't go wrong with what you pick because it will be good. I have had many items through out the years and have never complained about any of them. You can bring the pickiest of eaters here and they will find something to pick from the menu. You can get good food, drinks, desert, and service as that has been my experience on every visit. I would avoid busy times because the wait could be very long. Or plan ahead and don't arrive when you are very hungry or you will end up walking out and going somewhere else.

Mayra Z.,"Schaumburg, IL",124,260,476,3.0,7/22/2017,"I came here for brunch and was so underwhelmed with the service, Schaumburg always has better service. I ordered a skinnylious burger with salad and my boyfriend ordered the lunch portion of the orange chicken. To drink i ordered coffee and he ordered a mimosa and bloody mary.  The food was awesome as usual his orange chicken was so good! I wished I would have orderedit too! Hands down the best meal I've ever had here. The pieces of chicken were large and crispy. The sauce it was in was flavorful, sweet and tangy I loved how it got all over the white rice and coated the veggies with the chicken. The service....sigh....he forgot to offer us bread and then realized himself he forgot to offer it, we said no as we realized our meals were almost coming out. I ordered coffee and was never asked for a refill we had to get his attention and ask for it, same thing with my boyfriend's drinks we waved him down again for his drinks.  I think we will be sticking to the Schaumburg location.

Carl G.,"Naperville, IL",178,18,15,3.0,11/26/2016,"The service was average. Our food came quick, and our waters were filled regularly. Our conversations were being interrupted suddenly by the waitress just to see if everything was fine.  The food itself was average as well. The calamari is a nice appetizer that is crispy and tender. There's also a horseradish sauce on the side that complements the dish amazingly. My entree was the mushroom burger and it was mediocre at best. The flavor was in line with a microwaveable burger for some reason. The meat didn't have any flavor to it, and the burger was just topped with mushrooms and onions. The mixture was surprisingly bland and heavy unfortunately. The Fontina cheese didn't really do anything for the burger because it's quite mild. Definitely not what I expected. I ordered the Kahlua cheesecake, which is has flavors similar to Tiramisu, however, the Tiramisu cheesecake here is far too sweet. The Kahlua is just the right amount of sweet, and creaminess in a dessert. It's light for a cheesecake, and has an accent of coffee to contrast the cake's richness. If you like Tiramisu or other coffee related cakes, give the Kahlua a shot! It's called the Cheesecake Factory, so the cheesecake was great as expected. The other aspects of the meal were a little bit lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=40

Michelle M.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,1,1.0,10/5/2017,"I appreciate the feedback from the Cheesecake Factory.   I would like to advise you that every time I am there I DO let the manager know !  One day the floor in the washroom was so wet my young child fell and bumped her chin on the nasty wet washroom floor.  I walked up to the manager with her and we both told him what happened and all he said was he's have an employee take a look at it. Not at all sympathetic  To be completely honest with you, he blew it off  I was really disappointed.  I love the cheesecake and when the food is on point it's delicious !  But the washrooms and the smoking RIGHT outside the door to walk in are huge turnoffs.  If we're going to wait for over an hour for a table, things need to improve !   I can promise you from the bottom of my heart that the management has been notified several times regarding the washrooms being filthy. Next time I go I will get a few pics and post them to help you out.  I understand when management is going into an establishment, everyone scrambled to make things  look perfect.  Go there unannounced on a weekend night and you'll be in shock",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=40
Nicki S.,"Lombard, IL",67,179,111,5.0,3/31/2017,"I really loved my experience here with my family. Our server Paula was very attentive and humored my kids (with very short attention spans). We were worried about taking little kids out to a restaurant. Paula went above and beyond for us and made sure we were happy. My 3 year old decided to formally introduce himself and everyone at the table to her -- which was hilarious-- and she remembered his name and kept checking up on us. She even paid attention to the reason we were celebrating -- my husbands birthday -- and she said happy birthday to him (first name basis thanks to my son), brought us a lovely cheesecake which was decorated with sprinkles and chocolate writing. And she got a few other waiters to sing with her. We didn't have to ask. She is a doll. I hope management reads this because she deserves a pat on the back.     As far as food, I feel like we got great sized portions. Lunch size portions are available for certain dishes. My husband had a burrito. I know, burritos at the Cheesecake Factory? Easily one of the largest burritos I've seen at a ""chain"" restaurant! He said it was amazing. Kids menu is available and had lots of options. Of course, our Cheesecake was amazing too! No complaints. Great service.

Our order was quick, accurate and absolutely delicious. She made several trips to our table and even made sure to stop when our daughter called to her.

Raina K.,"Homewood, IL",2,22,71,3.0,8/2/2016,"If you've ever watched shows like ""Restaurant Impossible"", you've probably heard that restaurants that try to have a hundred different items on their menu generally don't have the best quality food. I would say this is completely true about the Cheesecake Factory. There are so many items on the menu that it's near impossible to decide, but the food is nothing spectacular. They also tend to be super busy, meaning the service is subpar.  I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, as it's usually raved about online. The chicken was super moist on the inside, and crispy on the outside. The pasta, however, was oily and the saucy didn't have any spice to it. There were also 5 slices of mushroom and two or three pepper chunks, which hardly qualifies as present in the dish. The serving was huge, and probably could have fed 3 people.  I also ordered the Kahlua cheesecake, which was amazing. I wasn't a fan of the brownie layer, but the coffee cheesecake and chocolate mousse were amazing.  Overall, you're paying high prices for average quality food and slow service.

Alexander L.,"Batavia, IL",0,3,,1.0,7/22/2017,"Extremely disappointed with my most recent visit. This visit was on Saturday 07/22/2017 from 5:45PM to 8:45PM. I have been dining at The Cheesecake Factory for a little over a year now. Me and my girlfriend have made it a staple visit at least once a month for the last 9 months. With that being said, my most recent visit has almost entirely ruined this destination. After our arrival, we were advised that our wait time would be ""no more than twenty minutes."" At least thats what the hostess said. Forty-five minutes later, and after having to watch multiple people who arrived after us be seated before us, we were finally seated. Our waiter seemed to prefer talking with his coworkers more than helping us, it took him approximately 15 minutes to bring us our DRINK ORDER. At first i just thought he was extremely busy, until we spotted him behind their staff station, very clearly laughing and messing around with the other waiters/ waitresses for about 5 minutes straight. Not only that, but when i tried to lighten the mood with a joke as we were ordering, stating that i was skipping liquor for the night, to be the DD; our waiter said to me, and i quote: ""Ive been stuck in that situation before buddy, but even when im the DD, I drink more than everyone else!""...... My date and I did not find this funny, as we both know someone who was killed by a drunk driver. Onto the food. I ordered a Cuban Sandwich with fries, and my girlfriend ordered the Fehttuchini Alfredo with chicken. My sandwich arrived cold, and not toasted. Her pasta arrived in a much smaller quantity than it usually does. After trying a few bites of both, we both agreed that the quality of our food had severely declined. We decided it was time to leave, asked for the check, and waited another 20 minutes for him to bring it to us. The total for our meals came out to $48.56, and after a tip, $56.56. However, I still wanted desert, so i let my girlfriend run to the car while I grabbed a spot in line, 15 minutes later, my order was taken. One slice of Lemoncello Torte. I kid you not, i waited 25 minutes for one slice of overpriced cake. (a little over $9.50 i believe). I am writing this review with great disappointment, as I gave this establishment a four star review last month. As of right now, i do not see myself continuing my tradition. Over $60 of my hard earned money, essentially down the drain. Very sad. I hope to hear from customer service, i have receipts to prove this night took place.

Hung up and called back a manager immediately picked up sounded like she was in the back office, she told me that there was a long line of people and that's why I was on hold for so long. She didn't know that I was staying at the hotel across the street, so when I WALKED by I saw two people there. I got the manager on the phone just to let her know that we took our business elsewhere.

Jessica S.,"Warrenville, IL",46,11,1,1.0,12/19/2017,"Very disappointed with this experience. We had an awful wait time. The hosts were so disorganized. They told us any minute 40 minutes in to our wait, then again an hour and 20 minutes into wait. They called us just to tell us to wait some more to the side. Servers were running around and bumping into people. The few times I got up from my seat, servers were bumping into me, with no apology.  Our server was so busy/apathetic. His name was Marcelino. We waited in the lobby (with a toddler) for an hour and 45 minutes. We were told it would be 45 minute wait. We sat down and waited for a server to greet us. He didn't say his name just asked if we were ready to order. We asked for another minute. He was about to leave when I had to say that I wanted to order a drink. I asked for a extra dirty martini. It was not extra dirty or dirty at all. I actually went up to the bartender and requested more olive juice. Our waiter saw me do this and asked nothing as to why.  He didn't come back to our table for another 20 minutes before we could order food. (we have a toddler). I asked for a kids menu. Never brought it until a member of our party asked a different waiter. (This took until our server came back 20 mins later.) for him to check on us to get the kids menu. We ordered apps and dinner. Our food was great. All except the kids chicken nuggets that I ordered for my toddler. We asked to have fruit instead of fries. They bring out fries. Fine. They said they would bring us out a fruit bowl. Minutes later, they take the fries away to give to another member of our table. Without a word. Weird, we thought. Since, already they messed up, why wouldn't they just let us keep the fries and bring out the other persons fries an additional order. That is usually what restaurants do. The Chicken fingers were horrible. We got them for our 18 months old and it was all breading. We had to really tear apart the chicken fingers to get to meat, which is all we would be giving to our child. I honestly expected more.  Overall, really disappointing. I think its been about 10 years since I have been here. I don't plan on coming back. I know that this last weekend was really busy for you all, but there has to be a better way. There were 10 people in our party and I know that we spent well over $700. You could have made it a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=20
Reem S.,"Lombard, IL",30,18,18,2.0,11/20/2017,"I went here on Saturday with my son for an early birthday dinner for myself, and had a really bad experience.  First, I called to ask what the estimated wait was for 2 people. The person who answered said 20/25 minutes. When I got there, they told me 30. I expected that, no problem. I arrived at 5:40PM. At 30 mins, I asked how much longer, and the hostess said 5 minutes. At 50 minutes, I was frustrated. I had a 7:15 movie to get to. I also wanted to do a starter, dinner, and dessert, and this was cutting it close. I spoke with the hostess and she was very dismissive and unapologetic. She said they couldn't account for people sitting there. I told her that's fine, but give me realistic expectations. If she told me 45 minutes when I got there, I would have left. She then argued with me that I have been waiting 43 minutes, not 48. I told her I have a text to my bf saying the wait when I got there at 5:40, so they waited to enter me in. She said no it automatically does it. She was rude and not good at her job. Finally we were seated and I figured it would still be okay but it took the waiter 10 minutes to walk over to us. I tried flagging other people down but no one came close. We were only able to enjoy our main dish. I had to take our cheesecakes to go. The food was good, and the waiter after that was nice. I asked him for the manager and he said he asked for them twice and they also never came. If management doesnt show up, why would their employees. I've been to a ton of cheesecake factories and this was really bad service. I'm never coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=20

Nina I.,"Glendale Heights, IL",39,54,44,5.0,5/27/2017,"Never disappointing, always accommodating, always great service, and always delicious. There's a reason why this restaurant, at every location, is always packed.  I have to keep my sodium intake low, which is impossible when you eat out. Having said that, here they've always accommodated my request to refrain from adding salt, and they've always done it with a smile. Nut allergies? No problem. They'll take all precautions necessary to ensure your dish is safe.  You'll have to set your budget a little higher here, especially if you plan on ordering one of their famous deserts ($7-8) but it will be worth it.  Points: -If you order a kids meal with fries, ask for no salt on the fries and add it yourself if needed.  -The tuna tataki salad is amazing, ask for the dressing on the side.  -Like carbonara? Substitute shrimp for chicken, you won't regret it! -I'm not one for skinny dishes but try their skinny chicken pot pie, it's not lacking anything and is a healthier choice than most.  -The banana cream cheesecake is my number one choice, super light with a fluffy/creamy filling that will satisfy you with a smile, even if you're not a fan of banana.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=20
Jeffery L.,"Chicago, IL",453,119,67,2.0,2/24/2017,"So the fun thing about this place is, it's always busy. Parking is available nearby with the connection to the mall, and there is valet parking as well should you need it. I know this place is renowned for its cheesecake, but since I don't like cheesecake, I cannot comment on that. The establishment itself looks like every other Cheesecake Factory, kind of like a modern-ish church feel with a bar thrown in there. Personally, I find it far too loud, but that's because it's busy because it surprises me - The food here is pretty much in my opinion like recooked leftovers, or if you want to bump it up just a tad, like gourmet airline food. I've been here nearly 5 or 6 times in the past few years and each time from the food to the service (or serious lack of) it gets progressively worse. The only thing I see as a perk here is the outdoor seating on nice weather, it's definitely a nice location. But that's about it. You are far better off trying perhaps Maggiano's across the street or even the Pour House. Definitely overcrowded, understaffed (at times), overcooked and definitely overrated. Quality is not a strong suit for the establishment that allows for them to have the prices that they've set. They are losing to the competition across the area tenfold as time will surely tell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=20

The calarmari was pretty good, just wished it was marinara sauce instead of cocktail sauce, just because that's my preference. We also tried the stuffed mushrooms, which were amazing. Then we had the NY strip steak entree with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus were perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were delicious. The steak was average, we asked for medium and seemed more medium rare. We didn't have room for desserts but we did get drinks. I had the Mai tai which was okay, but to my preference it was too strong but was very pretty looking. Then my boyfriend had just a cranberry vodka(grey goose) double shot, short, and he was impressed as they served it perfectly.

Rachel H.,"Chicago, IL",23,126,235,4.0,6/20/2017,"You really can't go wrong here. I swear they have to have one of the, if not the lengthiest menus. I mean it's a book! For some all the options can be overwhelming but, you will always find something on it to suit your taste buds I am sure. It's also always packed and usually a 30-40 minute wait on the weekends to be seated because this place is great for groups and special occasions. I enjoy the bar area to eat honestly, and it's typically first come first serve and not always crowded. I have had so many items off the menu over the years, but my favorites are the shrimp scampi and the firecracker salmon rolls. I literally some days stop in just for the salmon rolls! They're so tasty and crispy. The spicy chili sauce that comes with it is delicious too! The shrimp scampi comes with huge butterfly lightly battered shrimp that sit and swim in a linguine pasta sauce with garlic and butter and is oh so doggone good!! These dishes have never disappointed and honestly I don't think there has ever been a time I have been dissatisfied with a dish here. Some people are not into the big chain style restaurants, but I must admit this one here has proven itself over the years to be consistent with great food and great service. Their cheesecake is on another level of cheesecake. I mean like on the level you not sharing!! (lol), and I guess that is why the entire restaurant is named after it. I can eat their cheesecake all day everyday and not get tired of it. Always fresh, made as you order and come in every flavor you can think of. The strawberry is my favorite. Something about big, firm, fresh, sweet, juicy strawberry's on top of a cheesecake you just cannot get enough of. The drinks are pretty good too. My favorites are the Georgia Peach and the Strawberry Martini. My only pet-peeved here is they do not list the drink prices on their menu, which I don't understand why they do not? They list the prices of the food in the menu, so why not the drinks? If I am ordering a drink I surely wanna know how much it cost and feel silly asking the waiters how much every drink is. Sorry, but not sorry, I am not paying over $13 for no drink from nowhere. The parking on a weekend can get really congested especially since they're in the mall and in the restaurant district as I call it, so they share parking space with like 6 other restaurants, but if no parks let up after circling the parking lots over and over, you can park by Neiman Marcus, there's always  available space over there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=20

Susan F.,"Romeoville, IL",3,54,,1.0,6/4/2017,"This restaurant/location has been a family favorite for years, until yesterday. Our daughter had chosen to eat here for her birthday. We always try to get there a little ahead of the dinner crowd so as to not have a long wait. We were seated quickly in a small roundish section on the front edge of the restaurant. There were many tables open in this area and they placed us at a very sunny window. I figured they would drop down some shade if needed. Waiter took our drink order and brought waters quickly, but then it was hard to find him to order appetizers or even our meals. One of the times he came to us, he was holding someone's to go bag the whole time we were ordering. I thought that was a little odd. So as the setting sun was beginning to become a problem for a few of us (and we had mentioned it to our server to no avail) the shades finally began to come down, I could see again! Then just as quickly they went back up. Again something was said to the waiter and again was not interested. And then they came down again, and went back up again. This went on for some time. It was very distracting. (I found out later that it was the table next to us that wanted them up, the shades do not work individually, stupid design and those guests were wearing sunglasses, so why didn't they just sit outside!) BTW the vegetable that came with my dish was snow peas and when I asked to switch them out with asparagus (I love their asparagus!) I was told it would cost extra. Out of the 3 salmon dishes, I was ordering the most expensive as it was and all mine came with was rice and snow peas and they wanted to charge extra for the asparagus! Outrageous, I opted for the snow peas. When my dish came out I then understood why the upcharge. The snow peas, all four of them were garnish, not an actual vegetable, shameful. Now for the real reasons we will never come back. SALT OMG!!! My husband's, and two daughters' pastas were so salty, two of them couldn't eat them at all. My son's mashed potatoes were also inedible with too much salt and pepper. We have eaten here enough times to know this wasn't normal. We said something to the waiter and he brought out only my husband a new plate of pasta, but it too was salty. The manager came out, (he was very nice) and explained that they have to keep a lot of salt in the cooking water for the pasta. Not sure why. But he did nothing to correct anything. I felt really bad for my daughter whose birthday we were there celebrating since it was her pasta that she was unable to eat. Also no birthday celebration at all for her. And after a $335 tab we had to go home and eat something else. Guess we will have to take her somewhere else to celebrate. On a side note, there was a table that was adjacent to us whom they did come out a sing Happy Birthday to, but it was truly pathetic. The staff looked and sounded like they truly didn't want to be there. It was so bad that another table of young girls said a big Happy Birthday and clapped for them at the end, which did help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=20

I'm not a fan of chain restaurants so I usually won't eat at one at my own will but Cheesecake Factory  gets me every time. I take my clients for business lunch here often because of the variety in food. The variety range from Chinese to French cuisine! And plus their cheesecakes are truly decadent! MUST HAVE: tamale cakes for appetizer, southwest chicken chipotle pasta, & Hershey's chocolate cheesecake.  This is my first time ordering from their skinny menu. My order had hair in it so I didn't take one bite of if. I was offered by the server to get another entree but who knows if they will just remove the hair, stick it in the microwave and re serve the same dish??? So as hungry as I was, I refused to eat anything there at that time. It just took away my appetite.

Jude A.,"St. Charles, IL",105,7,1,5.0,9/4/2016,"My family had a group of 22 people (mostly adults with a few young kids aged 4 months to 15 years old) and this place was fantastic! I know that Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations so my mom, dad, grandma, and myself arrived around 3:45pm to hopefully get seated by 5pm for our large group. The hostess informed me that a manager would take care of me when I put down the group name and number. He told me that he could get us seated in 20 minutes.  Unfortunately, my family took longer to arrive than anticipated due to their children's sleep schedule. However, the manager worked with us to get 11 of us seated. Then an amazing waiter by the name of Steven helped us save two (and then a third) table for our group as the stragglers arrived. The appetizers were brought out promptly. Also, the refills were done without asking a few times which is always a plus! Even when Steven took his break because he was going to work a long shift, the servers and food runners did not skip a beat bringing out out our food, refills, and silverware. The food was delicious as usual. Overall, everything was amazing with our big group which normally is a hassle in a place that doesn't accept reservations but was a combination of luck, timing, and wonderful service (from the hostess, manager, server - Steve, and the food runners)!

Jeffrey S.,"Midvale, UT",1999,1698,2786,3.0,2/17/2016,"'Murica. I submit that this chain is the new poster child for 'Murica. It's supplanted the Red Lobsters and Olive Gardens and Chilis and Applebee's of the world (arguably) and now represents a night out with your parents. For your consideration: EXHIBIT A That menu is massive. If you can't find something you like, then you clearly don't like eating out. Not that it's masterfully prepared, but just that it covers the gamut from pastas to salads to burgers and steaks and chops and pizza and every dang thing in between. It's sensory overload, and it's perfectly American. We love our variety. We love one of everything.  EXHIBIT B The portions are massive. So, I don't want to jump on the bandwagon about big Americans, but the numbers don't lie. Numbers notwithstanding, I have also noticed that when I travel abroad, the serving sizes are smaller. Paint it how you like--American excess or a culture that seeks out good value--but the portions are honkin' huge here.  EXHIBIT C Dessert. So much dessert. And again, our national colors are red, white, blue and sugar. And there's plenty of it. Pages of cheesecake. So much. And some of it (like the cookie dough one I tried) is so sugared and tricked out, you don't really know you're eating cheesecake. Do yourself a favor and stick with a simple kind. EXHIBIT D  Massive interior. This location seemed to go on forever. I went for a hike the left from the hostess stand trailhead and I stopped for food along the way. So many tables. We love our big spaces! All that said, my hat is off to them for being open and feeding a road-weary dude like myself. They were open until midnight and still firing food at 11:30 when I rolled in. The pasta and chicken I had, while salty and rich, was still hot and served fast, so I could get to my hotel and get to bed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=60

Tonight I would have given it 2 stars for my mediocre meal, but my family had slightly better luck so I'll give it 3 stars overall. We arrived around 6pm when it wasn't busy (we had maybe a 10 minute wait for a table) yet it took nearly half an hour to get our food. I opted to try the eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta for the first time. I won't be ordering it again. The five eggplant medallions arrived looking tasty with a tightly wound side of very oily angel hair pasta that looked stiff. It was. I'm a fan of al dente pasta, but it mine was simply undercooked and tough. No problem, when our waiter, Stephen, passed by I let him know and he said he'd bring more.  In the meantime I was enjoying my eggplant medallions. Alas the last two were also undercooked - eggplant is good firm, but it shouldn't have any crunch to it! Because we wanted to head out, I didn't bother mentioning this to Stephen and just finished it up along with the fresh pasta (which was cooked properly although still way too oily.)  My daughter and wife had fine meals. We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go since we were running a bit late due to the slow service. Fortunately my daughter took a peek in the takeout bag because our server had brought the entirely wrong cheesecake. Not a big deal, but another delay and an easily avoided problem if he had just double checked the order.

After self-parking our car and walking in to the restaurant, we were greeted politely by the Valet Parker, even though we did not want to pay him $4 to park our car.  The hostess and the manager greeted us and sat us at our table in less than 2 minutes, but then again, we came at around 5:15 pm - a great time to avoid the dinner crowd, which normally comes after 6:00 pm on a Friday night. When our waitress came over to greet us and got our drink and appetizer orders, she quickly returned with the drinks and later, the Thai Lettuce Wraps - SUPER YUMMY!  From there, everything went down hill fast in terms of service.  Like most people, we made a mess eating our appetizers because the lettuce was dripping with sauces on the table - talk about finger ""licking"" good!  After she took away our appetizers, she didn't even bother to clean the table - which was clearly messy and visible by everyone.  How can you not see the sauce all over the table and not even wipe it down????? We all decided to wait and see what she would do next, and sure enough, she came back with our dinner plates and served them on top of the messy table without blinking an eye - UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  Then she cleared the table of dirty dishes and still didn't even clean the ""new mess"" on top of the ""old mess.""  After all that said, we ordered dessert and waited for her to bring out our cheesecakes, and you guess it, she served them on the dirty table - WOW!!!!

Susie C.,"Forest Park, IL",106,498,254,3.0,5/11/2015,"My family and I came here for dinner on a Saturday evening...around 5pm. It was already a lot of people, and we had a wait time of 1.5 hours before we could get a table for 6 people. It was Mother's Day weekend, so the wait time may have been increased. We were able to walk around the mall during this 1.5 hours, so we didn't have to sit around and wait at Cheesecake. They give you a buzzer that they say the mall is within range.  Onto the food - we ordered few appetizers - cobb salad (which was VERY good - it was everyone's favorite), texmex egg rolls (I really enjoyed it), Salmon Firecrackers (ehh a little boring), and Southern Fried Chicken sliders which were okay. For entree I had the pasta with shrimp and sausage. It's rigatoni pasta with spicy peppers, Italian Sausage, and Shrimp. I really like the sauce. It was good. My husband had their pasta dish with Chicken which he thought was okay. My mom had their steak Diane and salmon combo..she did not enjoy her steak too much - she said it was a bit too burnt. My sister had a pasta dish and she thought it was okay. My grandma had the salmon dish. She didn't say much. My mom-in-law had their steak - she like the flavors but also thought the steak was too burnt. We ended the evening with one slice of the fresh strawberry cheesecake. I thought it was good, but everyone else said it was just average. Overall - decent food, big menu and lots of selections. Service was just okay - they were very busy so we had to wait awhile for our waitress to come.

So imagine my displeasure at the nachos that were so overbaked they were brown; a drizzle of cheese and 3 jalapeno slices. (I should have taken a picture). And my son ordered a steak well done and it arrived medium. The waiter tried to justify it by saying the meat next to the bone is always pink. First, not true. Second, the pink piece was cut from the opposite side.

It is also pricey (not surprising: downtown Chicago is always pricey) and if you want dessert it is at a minimum $10 that you would pay for dessert, so you can imagine the price of the rest of the plates, BUT it is SO worth the delicious food and I had a wonderful time with my family admiring the theme of the restaurant (very Alice in Wonderland) and chatting with each other on a Sunday evening and that was worth the money and time I wasted getting a table there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=100

This is not to say that the latter are always hits and the former duds. No...there must be something to (most) corporate/chain places that made them such a success in the first place. Cheesy Factory, that's what I call it, has a winning formula. They're huge, the cheesecake is actually really good, their usually pretty slick and professional with reservations, seating, service, etc. And the food is actually pretty dayum good. And we're talking a, what? 15 page menu here? How do they do it. My guest told me their kitchen has a zillion staff and it's a little nuts in there. I believe it. How they can keep all those ingredients fresh or make sense of a lunch rush of tickets coming I don't know but they do. I had a lunch miso salmon over brown rice with spring peas. It was cooked perfectly and very succulent with - let's use the word - umami. My pineapple Moscow mule was excellent if a bit sweet. Guest tends to get the build your own Asian lettuce wraps and she built me one and it was delicioso. The presentation on that one is really phenom too. I mean this place even plates stuff upscale. Not bad. I'm gigging Cheesy Factory a star, however, for having $__.95 prices. It's not $15.95, it's $16. Have a level of class as befits your food. I hate that _.99 or _.95 thing!

Silverware still had remnants of food and crumbs on them, which grossed us out extremely. The stuffed tater tots were very good going down, but an hour after the meal they gave me a hearty stomachache. The Colby burger tasted just like any other McDonald's burger, which is the opposite of what you'd expect considering the price. The fettuccine alfredo was similar to the tater tots: very rich and creamy going down, but not very good an hour after the meal.

The meal was hearty and taste good overall. By the time I'd finished my entree I was full and could only order a slice of strawberry cheesecake to go.

My family and I have been coming here for years, but the only time there's anything wrong with the order is when we get take out. The fact that this location can treat a regular customer so badly is just sad.

Yes, scratch.  I could eat at Cheesecake 4 days a week for the rest of my life and be happy. Great food, great service, just too damn crowded so you have to time it right or you'll be caught in the crush of hungry bellies.   Had soup and salad here yesterday: amazing New England clam chowder (do I have to say it?), and tossed salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  Winner, as always.  No complaints here, only praise for one of my fave chains in the USA.  Great, great service with a smile, as usual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=120
Sharita R.,"Romeoville, IL",116,216,404,3.0,4/19/2015,"I hate having to give this place 3 stars because I've been here quite a few times with no issues, but last night's visit had quite a few awful moments. No matter what, if you are visiting on the weekend for dinner expect obscene wait times. I'm talking 60-90 minutes. The place is huge and they do their best for quick turnover, but the wait is unavoidable. There is the option to dine outside, but despite the offer from the hostess, it was just too chilly for that.       I suggest you head to the bar during your wait. To the bartender with the full tattoo sleeves-you rock and you made the rest of the evening tolerable. My martini was delicious and the sample of that ice cream concoction was awesome! You made sure we had everything we wanted and you made the wait time fly by.      Unfortunately, that was the only highlight of the evening. Our server, although nice, seemed as if she was having an off night. The table next to us that she was serving received the wrong food-she admitted to ringing it up wrong. They were pretty cool with it. She was pretty hard to get a hold of throughout the night as well.       I ordered the jambalaya pasta and my husband ordered the bacon burger. We also started off with Cuban egg rolls as an appetizer. The appetizer was delicious and I was excited for the main course. I received my pasta-the presentation was perfect. And then I started to dig around my dish with my fork. My pasta was pretty much still curled up in spirals and there was no sauce. That's right. No sauce added at all. This dish has a cream Cajun sauce that makes it-tonight there was none to be found. My husband's burger was a bit overcooked and the bacon was extra charred, but he dealt with it and just ate it. The fries also tasted kinda stale to me.     I alerted the waitress about my pasta with no sauce and she offered to bring out sauce or take it back. We had already been waiting quite a while so I just asked for the sauce. Time goes by. I see my waitress come back with no sauce. Apparently it would have to take another 5 minutes on top of the time I had already waited to make some sauce for me. When the sauce finally arrived it just looked like stewed tomatoes in a bowl. No cream sauce to be found. I just took the tepid runny sauce and poured it myself over the pasta-it made the pasta a bit more edible.       Sigh. I usually have quite good experiences at this Cheesecake Factory, but this time I was only left with a disappointing feeling and leftovers that I really didn't want.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=120

I stood at the register for at least ten minutes and not one of the four associates addressed me with a hello, one moment please, or let me get someone to assist. The sad part is at least two of the associated we're managers. The person who actually worked in that area was fooling around on the register. She looked me directly in my face and said nothing. Then after she was done with whatever, still no assistance.  A waitress walked up to the register and asked for change as if I wasn't standing there waiting. Finally, she took my order and as she handed me the bag I said ""have a good night"" no reply.

Ordering drinks took a long time as well. As far as food goes, I had a chicken tostada salad that was amazing. Not low fat by any means but I didn't care. Portions were so big that I had half to take home, and it still filled up the whole container.  We split a piece of cheesecake. So rich you only need one for two people!

Renita M.,"Lombard, IL",437,804,41,4.0,11/13/2013,"Yeah, I know, it's a big chain with a big menu, blah blah blah. But I will give them some credit: they actually do make everything fresh, and regularly change up their large menu with seasonal items. Here's what I liked: No wait around 5:30 on a Friday (though there certainly was one when we left) Service was solid Food was really good, actually We got nachos as an appetizer; they had tasty pulled chicken, good amounts of cheese, fresh guacamole and pico de gallo, and were nice and hot. For my dinner I got two items from the small plates -- a sausage and ricotta flatbread and an arugula salad, lightly dressed with lemon, olive oil, parmesan, marcona almonds and golden raisins. The flatbread was deliciously garlicky (a little skimpy on the sausage but oh well) and the crust was airy and chewy-crisp. The salad was well-dressed and just the right size. My husband got a chipotle chicken sandwich and seemed to enjoy it.  Not all of the portions are huge, I'd like to add -- they do have a nice variety of more reasonable sized plates. That said I did see one of the biggest burritos in existence, about a foot long and at least four inches wide.  What's not to like? Well, the building has huge ceilings and the tables are close together so it's very echoey and kind of loud.  And there is the argument that if you have a menu spanning sushi rolls to pasta dishes to Tex-Mex you may not be doing any of it well -- I can't speak for the entire menu, but I can say that what we ate was good. That said the prices are a couple bucks higher than I'd like for the quality and atmosphere. We probably won't be regulars here, because it does seem to cater primarily to tourists, business travelers and mall-goers, but I would come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=180

He said that he would give me the apples they forgot to put on my salad and a cheesecake. Not a new salad with apples. He expected me to not eat on my lunch break and wait 4.5 hours and drive back to the restaurant for apples. I  tried to be very nice about the issue but he kept insisting that I was only getting a cheesecake. Eventually he opted out of cheesecake and said he would give me the salad, but not willingly.

We went in and waited about 30 minutes not big deal it was Saturday afternoon and the wait was not bad. We were given a nice table and waited quite awhile for our server but they were busy so that part was okay and she was really nice. Now for the food. It just was awful. I was so looking forward to trying the mac/burger since it was my first time at this place. I ordered it medium with no salt on the fries. It came out like a brick and the fries had so much salt I sent it back. Than when it came out again it was RAW I mean not even medium rare but raw so I couldn't eat is and by that time I was done. My friend had a veggie burger and she hated it very mushy but she didn't say anything. My other friend had a chicken buffalo sandwich they brought the wrong sauce (blue cheese) and when she said something they just brought out new sauce but by then the sandwich was ruined and she didn't eat her either. My other friend got a salad and sweet potato fries and said the salad was just okay but the fries were full of grease. The manager did come over and take 2 items off the check but it wasn't enough we should not have been charged for anything other than the drinks. Just bad customer service as far as I am concerned. Even with 2 meals taken off it was still almost 75.00 without the tip.

Of course the waits are always long on weekend nights and parking is always difficult, but it's worth it. I'm always excited for the bread especially the sweet brown one.  I normally get the salmon with mashed potatoes which is always good. The chicken and biscuits are yummy too, huge portions. Recently I tried the the fish tacos. I remember the first time I tried them I wasn't that impressed, but I wanted something light so I decided to try it again. I liked the fish tacos, not so much the salsa though. The fish was very light and no fishy taste at all. The black beans and rice had a weird flavor. I would have rather had it plain white rice and beans.  The dessert is what's it's all about. Can't go wrong with any of the choices. I personally like the chocolate mouse because it's a lighter cheesecake for after dinner.  The one thing I like best is that they give you large portions.

Angela P.,"Aurora, IL",440,1743,13,2.0,2/13/2013,"My last review stated that the golden rule of Cheesecake Factory was to avoid, avoid, AVOID on Fridays and Saturdays. My rule has changed:  Avoid Cheesecake Factory (Oak Brook) altogether. My friend and I met here for a gluttonous Fat Tuesday meal.  I had the macaroni and cheese burger, followed by a slice of raspberry lemon cheesecake.  I felt like I had a brick in my stomach all the way through to the next morning!  I'm not complaining, though, Cheesecake Factory really is one of America's best and holds up the stereotype that we eat way too much.  But the food is good.   The menu is all over the place, so they don't really have a speciality.  Order what intrigues you or your guilty pleasure - you'll like it. So why the 2 stars?  The service here is HORRIBLE!  Our waitress, Tasha, seemed normal at first.  She told us about the specials, and her favorite cheesecakes, and our drinks and food arrived without a problem.  The end of the meal is when it got strange.  She delivered our checks with 2 pens.  2 pens with Cooper's Hawk printed on them.  Huh? When she came back for our checks, she demanded to know where the second pen was.  I ignored her at first, since any sane person would glance around quickly and then walk away.  It is, after all, a pen.  A pen that belongs to another restaurant!  Instead, she stood there while I stared right back at her and said, ""I don't know.  I don't know where it is.""  She stood there while I looked under the table and my friend shuffled plates and napkins around.  No pen.  She continued to stand there.  Awkward. When she finally walked away, I overheard her sarcastically say to another waitress, ""do you have a pen I can borrow?""

There are, at minimum, two dozen types of cheesecake from plain to fruity to decadent chocolate. Ever wonder what is meant by the phrase gilding the lily? The answer is: The Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. Whipped cream is not enough for these people! They must stuff it with candy, or maybe stir in booze, or sprinkle it with chips or streusel, or top it with frosting. They layer it with cake, or brownies, or fresh fruit. If you're a person who, when it comes to desserts, believes more is more; then The Cheesecake Factory is for you! The sweets don't stop with cheesecake either. Oh heavens no! There are ice cream sundaes, cakes, tortes, milkshakes, and tiramisu. Now I know I just called this place a crowd-pleaser, but that does not mean it tops my personal list of restaurants. Although the food is good and I've never had any dish here to complain about, it isn't great. The Cheesecake Factory's strength is variety. You can please the kids, the grandparents, and the vegetarians all in one place. For me, the entire concept from decor to menu is over-the-top. Sensory overload. Too many menu items. Too many embellishments. Too much noise. Too many people. Too many tables too close together. Too many smells. No, seriously! Try enjoying your cheesecake on a not-exactly-clean table only a foot away from neighboring tables eating fish and pasta. It's too much for me. I'm much more likely to drop by for a slice of cheesecake to take home. But then again, if I've got a big group to feed with varied tastes and of various ages, I will likely consider The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=200

I ordered fish tacos I have had them before but this time they were awful just a friend piece of fish in a tortilla with barely any salsa and they forgot the slaw. The side of lime on the plate was all dried up and the Rice and beans were both cold like they were just taken out of the refrigerator. My husband had the enchiladas it looked like a plate of slop covered heavily with cilantro. He said they were tasteless. My daughter ordered the chicken Madeira she said the chicken was rubbery, the mashed potatoes were cold and she mentioned the sauce was very salty. My other daughter had the chicken bellagio which our server said was amazing, needless to say I could tell by the few bites she ate it was far from it.

Yvonne B.,"Chicago, IL",384,866,1948,2.0,6/29/2012,"When I was a small, going to McDonald's was a treat. Now it makes me feel sick. Then, when I was in my early 20s and didn't know better, TGI Friday's was my FAVORITE restaurant. At that time, going to the Cheesecake Factory was a big ooh la la deal. I considered the Cheesecake Factory to be high class fancy. Not so much anymore. Now I just think it's overrated. The super high ceilings, murals, and lighting are reminiscent of a banquet hall or ballroom; however, that's in stark contrast to their booths and regular tables. The servers do their jobs. Nothing more and nothing less. It's not exceptional. At one point I wandered around looking for a bathroom and it took several employees passing me by before one kind soul gave me any kind of direction. The food is okay, although I only got dessert during my most recent visit. My buddy got cheesecake (which he loved!) and I got a Tres Leches Milk Shake. The milk shake was super caramel-y and super sticky sweet for my taste. It was also so huge that I hardly devoured a quarter of it before I brought it to my fridge at home. I might visit The Cheesecake Factory at the Oak Brook Mall if I happen to be there for something else (e.g. shopping); however, I don't think I would seek it out just because. I mean, heck - there's even better restaurants at the mall. I might only head over to the Cheesecake Factory if I want dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=200

Took about 15 minutes for a beer and sangria to get to our table and then the habachi steak without mushrooms we ordered medium well was burnt and had mushrooms. Our server Megan was beyond amazing though asked if she could fix anything for us. Then the manager stopped over and told us our cheesecakes would come out faster than normal. We laughed because at that point we've already waited enough for everything anyways. Coming from the industry ourselves, we know how things work. The only thing good about our meal was Megan our fantastic server.

Jin Joo L.,"Lisle, IL",449,155,83,1.0,10/17/2014,"Where do I even begin?  I don't think I've ever had it this bad at any restaurant except one, ever!  Usually I love Cheesecake Factory and they are always friendly, professional, and food is great.  Well, I guess not all restaurants are the same.  As far as the Oak Brook location, I'm very scared for them.  I've never experienced anything less than great from the Woodfield location.   I went in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.  My friend showed up late so we sate around 1:40 pm.  She came around after a few minutes to get us water and drinks.  Then at some point came by to take our orders.  We've been catching up so we requested a few more minutes, not a half hour!!!  She didn't come or show her face for another 30 minutes.  Took our order and finally gave us bread.  Now remember we sat at 1:40, but I was waiting there for my friend since 1 pm!  Imagine how hungry I am. Took our orders great!  Food come out in another 20 or so minutes.  My food is ok... tomatoes are a bit mushy.  I got the Chicken Avocado Club... my friend got Orange chicken.  His was so badly cooked he couldn't eat it and sent it back.  I believe the rice and flavors were somewhat burnt tasting and was not tasting normal, and he's had this dish many many times.  So another 10 minutes before we could find someone to take it back.  Few more minutes to come ask take another order.  Instead of lunch he settled for cheesecake.  She came back with the check and left it there.  I admit we talked for at least another hour or so but, she never came by for at least an hour and half to even check on us.  Maybe filled our waters twice during our entire meal.  I have no idea why it was so hard to get any service at such a restaurant with many servers.  It was as if she either didn't care much or just didn't want to show her face.  I don't know whatever her reason was, but it was unacceptable.  Usually, I'd call over a manager right away, but seeing how bad service was, I was afraid the manager wouldn't manage as well either.  So instead, sadly, being a past server and manager myself, I never do this but I did not leave much tip.  I won't say how much but just simply wrote, ""Thank you for the bad service,"" on the receipt and left.   Maybe a manager will see this and hopefully they will manage a bit better or check on their guests a bit more?  With so many employees, why was it so hard to do their jobs?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=240

Andrew M.,"Palatine, IL",32,208,12,3.0,9/17/2013,"Met some friends here for lunch on Sunday around noon. We sat in the bar at a high top. Our waitress was attentive, and kept our glasses full for the majority of the meal. It took us a long time to choose our orders because we were catching up, and the menu is like 30 pages long... Seriously who needs that many options?  Anyway I had a couple tall Honker's Ales as they were on tap. I ate the Chicken and Biscuit meal. The biscuit and gravy was excellent while the chicken was so-so. The mixed veggies and mashed potatoes served with it were also pretty good. It was the 1st time I have ever finished a meal at the CF without feeling like I was going to explode.  My wife ordered a side caeser salad (love their dressing), and a lunch portion of a sundried tomato and chicken pasta. When her pasta was delivered, it was covered in a cream sauce which was not mentioned anywhere on the menu (interesting as they have plenty of space for that kind of detail). She requested they make her a new one without cream sauce as she is what I lovingly refer to as a lactard (lactose intolerant). The waitress that dropped off the pasta said something along the lines of ""well it always comes with cream sauce on it."" Which I thought was pretty rude, but I let it slide. Our actual waitress came over, apolgized for the mixup and took the pasta to have it remade as requested. The manager also stopped at our table to apologize and offer to bring my wife a complimentary soup which we politely declined. When the bill came they did remove the pasta from the bill which was appreciated. The other couple we met ordered the buffalo burger (burger with fried onion straws, bleu cheese, and buffalo sauce) and the chicken avocado club. Both looked delicious.  Overall, the experience was pleasant. The good thing about cheesecake factory is you seem to always get exactly what you would expect. A menu with way too many options to choose from, giant portions that you shouldn't finish (but probably will), average to slighlty above average service, average food, and outrageous cheesecake (if you had the will power to not eat your entire meal).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=240

Other things eaten: fried mac n cheese balls (not good the day after), hummus and pitas (a LARGE amount of hummus), southwest chicken sandwich (very tasty!), red velvet and smores cheesecake, southwestern egg rolls, and a couple other things I can't remember.

My friends tried to bully me into getting a different cheesecake for each course of my meal. Had I not eaten ice cream for lunch that day, I may have done just that. Each slice is like a generous slice of heaven. Depending on your mood, you can get something light and palette cleansing, like the mango key lime, or something rich and decadent, like the Godiva chocolate on chocolate on chocolate.

Given the occasion for my being there in the first place, the first booth they tried to seat me at would not work.  I asked for a table.  It doesn't exist in this restaurant.  EVERY TABLE has at least one bench for seating ~ no 4 chairs.  So while I'm waiting for the person to check on a switch, another guy comes and tries to seat another party, RIGHT WHERE I ALREADY AM.  He gives me the, ""excuse me"" I want to seat someone else where you are sitting.  Then the first guy comes back and arranges 2 tables in the most crazy way ~ put them together between other tables instead of just putting us at the end of the row.  Before I can gather all my belongings from the original booth, the second guy is back with the same party he tried to seat while I was still there.  When I asked about the end, the original guy became very frustrated with me and said I needed to speak with a manager. Why is this SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO friggin' hard? So, I come back in and am seated in exactly the SAME location only on the other side of the wall.  Okay, the rest of the party begins to arrive. Then, when we are comfortable and chatting, another guy comes over to inform us that they are going to have to move us so they can seat other patrons where we are.  Being the bold Yelper that I am, I refused to move, one more time. He tried to convince me that we WERE going to move and when another person in the party spoke up, he very sarcastically said, ""Enjoy your meal."" Each meal came out individually, one at a time.  Again, something I have never experienced before.  Not hot by the time mine finally came out.  NO BIG SURPRISE THERE.

The bread in the beginning is quite good. Drinks and beer are pricy so save your money and go to pour house across the street. They unfortunately do not give complimentary cheesecake for your birthday , bit of a shame. Had chicken teriyaki it was so so. Tried the nachos and spinach dip. Decent flavored.Greek salad I liked it really was well put together. They have wide menu but nothing stands out out of the world tho aside from cheesecake. Casual place with family in the mall.

Zach N.,"Boston, MA",50,114,,3.0,4/22/2013,"I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience this weekend. My girlfriend loves the place and insisted we go. I try not to be snobby, but I have high standards for food. My date was quick to remind me that it's The Cheesecake Factory, not ""The Food Factory."" Noted. We were starving so we got the fried cheese off of the ""small plates"" menu. Mozzarella sticks, essentially. They were good though. In fact, they were probably better than my entree. I got the fish and chips. True to Cheesecake Factory lore, the portion was massive. The fish was decent, but the breading was a little thick and doughy. It was served with a fist-sized portion of coleslaw and tartar sauce. Provided the breading wasn't too thick, a piece of fish with tartar sauce and a forkfull of coleslaw made for a pretty good bite. My girlfriend got the shrimp and bacon sandwich. It was giant. Triple decker. Lots of lettuce. The shrimp were grilled, and unfortunately they were insanely overcooked. The sandwich had good flavor though. Anyways, one comes to the Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake, right? So we got some. She got the new Oreo one, and I got raspberry chocolate truffle. Hers was total overkill, but delicious. Mine was a little more traditional, and excellent. I'd definitely go back for cheesecake, but I don't know about this place becoming a staple in my list of go-to restaurants.  Notes: The place is MASSIVE, yet at 4PM on a Sunday it was still a 15-20 minute wait for the two of us. Also, I'd estimate that 85% of the massive menu is deep-fried. They have a ""skinnylicious"" menu with lower-calorie options, but the Cheesecake Factory is 100% an all-American eatery, both in methods of food prep and in portion size. Take that as you will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=260
William B.,"Wheaton, IL",3,4,,1.0,8/16/2014,IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD!  We have been going to this restaurant for more than a decade and generally are pleased every time. This was nothing short of horrific!  We ended up sitting at a table near the bar area-possibly the first problem. Server gives attitude to my wife and son while I am away apparently. Food comes and my son's order is wrong--somehow they mistake pizza for Mac and cheese; Madeira good as always. They say they will get pizza. 15 mins later we ask another server to get us bread and check on our pizza because we have not seen our server. Oops-- they never put the pizza order in. Our server finds out and apologizes and says it will be right away-first order in kitchen and promises us they will cover meal and a couple pieces of cheesecake. Meanwhile she disappears again and I go up to bar to get refills for water and Cokes for our table on several occasions--not the most pleasant group there but fine.  Another 15 minutes--no pizza and more self service on the drinks. I lost it and went to look for a manager. He ends up getting us a different waiter Brandon B who was very nice--but the damage was done. Then the 'manager' actually has the gall to reduce the comp for the bad service; he takes off the small pizza and 1 slice of cheesecake that we had to get 'to go' because it was now late and we had been done with our food for 30 minutes.  I get it--some people probably complain and take advantage of you--but that wasn't me so you need to figure out a different way to identify abusers.  That comp for that bad of service was weak--frankly you should have paid me tonight--that's how bad it was.  To put it simply--Your service sucked tonight!  I hope to finish off my gift cards from this place at another location but frankly nothing is real convenient from Wheaton. We may suck it up for a few times more but you definitely lost a loyal customer tonight. You need to replace your servers and managers-- go across the street to Maggiano's.

We didn't have to wait the usual hour here usually and always find the food and decor better here than the other locations. Service has been just sort of ok but nothing egregious.  Menu is the usual overwhelming gigantic mess but at least there are options for everyone. I recommend using the small plates or apps to make a meal. It saves money, still lots of food, plus you will have room for a cheesecake. The latter can easily be split among three people or two depending on how hungry you are.

My daughter was almost done with her food by the time mine came, a cheesesteak sandwich, it was pretty gross too, super greasy.

Marc R.,"Woodridge, IL",0,1,,1.0,10/5/2014,"My wife, son and I went to the Cheesecake Factory tonight.  50 minute wait but we knew that is part of the deal. After being seated, we order drinks - Sangria for my wife, Long Island Iced Tea for me and strawberry lemonade for my son.  My drink was awful! It tasted like 15 sour lemons squeezed into a glass with a splash of brown liquid.  Undrinkable! Asked for manager, and was presented with Christopher Johannsen, who said he was sorry I didn't like it. It was it that I didn't like it - it was that it was the most horrible cocktail I have ever had the misfortune to sip!  I asked for a Diet Coke instead. Dinner comes.  My wife's skinny steak is fine - my skinny enchiladas look good as well.  However, no cheese pizza for the son.  Christopher comes out - again - to let me know it will be 5 minutes.  We decide to eat as my son doesn't care if we do, and after my second piece of ""chicken tooth"" (or gristle - whatever you want to call it) - I was done.  Set the plate aside and explained to waitress that two bits of enchilada spit out pretty much soured me on the whole experience. Pizza finally comes.  I ask to speak to the manager again, and I suggest that as pizza was late, my food and drink were nauseating, and our whole evening and experience was a disaster, that Christopher not bring me any bill whatsoever.  Christopher, in his infinite manager wisdom, would have none of that and offered to comp my drink, my dinner, and the pizza, but not the entire thing.  We discussed this back and forth and I made it clear I would not expect to be paying ANYTHING but ol' Christ would not hear of it.   I explained this to the waitress and asked if there was a ""real"" manager I could speak to.  Eventually some other older guy came over, and with no attempt at an apology, or even a fake act to show that he was at least concerned about our experience, told us to go ahead and not pay and just leave.  So we did. What a disaster!  It's obvious that the Cheesecake Factory is so large that they don't care about a customer here or there, so that is why I was so surprised how hard it was to get them to comp our lousy meal.     I hope everybody reads this and forwards to the awful management staff at that restaurant but I doubt they would care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=260

Can you go a bit slower?  #3: (apparently gives up, because asking her to be understandable is too much): Your total will be ($) and it will be ready in 15 minutes. Me: Um, I'd still like to know what kind of dressings there are please. #3: (FINALLY slows down enough for me to catch a few words, from which I can figure out my options). Me: ok I'll take the vinaigrette please. #3: It'll be ready in 20 minutes. *click* I get there (I love how after picking my dressing the time I had to wait magically went up by 5 minutes) and they forgot the bread (when I pointed this out they actually looked in my bag to make sure I wasn't lying before giving it to me.) The soup was bland and the bread was stale. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for mediocre food and worse, deplorable customer service.

Roxanne E.,"St Paul, MN",3,50,3,2.0,9/22/2012,"Arrived at 5:00 on a friday as most of our group had very early flights out the next day.. Our party of 5 was seated right away. The restaurant was incredibly loud. The music was pounding. We could barely hear each other talk. Add a screaming baby and you have bedlam. Our waiter had a plastered on smile that never moved. However his eyes never actually looked at us. He kept scanning the restaurant for who knows what. The waiter lined us up with two glasses of water each. This was our first sign that he did  not intend on coming back very often. We ordered appetizers: grilled artichoke, calamari, corn cakes. The artichoke was good, the corn cakes were excellent and the calamari was sub-standard, I ordered the Moroccan chicken. It was good but not exceptional. My friends said their food was ok, but not really remarkable. We finally were able to flag down the waiter to order deserts. One of our party asked if there was a cheese cake sampler. The waiter replied ""That would defeat the purpose."" I have no idea what that meant. We ordered two desserts and requested five plates and forks so we could split the deserts. The waiter returned with three forks. No plates. No forks for the other two people in our party. We asked again for the plates and two more forks. We never saw him again until he delivered the bill. Final total was about 48.00 per person. Not worth it. For that price I expect good service and a nice atmosphere.

(Albeit, a ridiculously salty one-- the garlic noodles tasted like a metric boatload of butter, garlic, and salt; my boyfriend and I both agreed that the asparagus was easily the best part of the dish!)

We were told that the wait would be 50 minutes, so we decided to hang around, and were seated within that time window.  The ambience of this location is interesting. It's reminiscent of an Italian cathedral with high ceilings, buttresses, and sconces on the walls. Our table was in the corner of the restaurant, in a large circular area that provided a nice intimate feeling.  The waiter was quite attentive. We ordered Chicken Madeira, Chicken And Biscuits, Chicken Carbonara, and Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya over Fettucine. I was a bit surprised that dinner didn't include a soup or salad option. Our meals arrived in a timely manner - or at least most of them did. Three of the dishes were brought out by the runner. We waited about 5 minutes, then I found our waiter and informed him that one of our party was still waiting for their plate. The FOH manager came by and I informed him of the missing dish. He disappeared for a few moments and brought back the missing entrée - all without an explanation or apology.  A few minutes later the waiter came back and explained that this particular runner had forgotten dishes at least twice that evening. The waiter said that he had informed the kitchen manager of the problem as well. The rest of the meal was uneventful, and the dishes were very tasty (although my son, who had the Chicken and Biscuits, became violently ill that night). I realize that sometimes there are issues - however, a simple apology from the manager would have gone a long toward a higher rating.

Olivia C.,"Villa Park, IL",9,9,,3.0,11/15/2014,Ok as we all know the food here is delicious. However each time I have gone here the service is questionable. I'm not a needy customer but I do get a little annoyed when I have to wait for water and bread and I see others getting it right away. This has happened each time I've gone to this location. I still go back because I love the cheesecake. I don't expect being served like a queen but the basics wouldn't hurt. When Someone comes into a restaurant chances are they're really hungry just bring them bread right away. It might seem small but it makes a huge difference in a dining experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=280
Nicki S.,"Hammond, IN",1,9,,1.0,12/29/2014,"I recently visited this location for the first time a couple weeks ago and was not impressed. I went back a second time this past weekend (some friends wanted to go) and let's just say I will never be going back again. I ordered a veggie burger and the next day I had food poisoning! After doing some research, this veggie patty is supposedly egg free which  means there is nothing in the patty that should cause sickness. The only logical explanation left is clearly severe mishandling and food contamination. I am absolutely disgusted thinking about what I ate. Besides their low food standards, the wait for a table was an hour at dinner time unless you were able to snag a table in the bar. If you are lucky enough to get a table in the bar, you end up surrounded by people ready to pounce on you the second they see your bill arrive so they can cut their wait time. The service was decent but took awhile for drinks to arrive. Overall just a negative experience for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=280

Their food wood be quite good if they would just season it lightly and lay off the pounds of garlic. And I'm a garlic lover! While the food is decent, there is no consistency. I've always liked what I've had, but keep finding that I order the same thing and sometimes like it more than other times. The last time I went there they must have decided that they don't care about their customers. I was going to get a few pieces of cheesecake and wanted to make sure they would put the raspberry sauce they usually do. They said it comes with that. Then I decided to save some money and get an entire cake. The cakes come frozen. She made sure they had the right cake and I asked for the sauce. She said the whole cakes don't come with the sauce. Are you F-ING kidding me? I'm paying $32 and you can't give me some sauce? What is it, 50cents? You're going to begrudge me half a buck?

Amy L.,"League City, TX",1,8,,1.0,5/15/2015,"Disgusting jerks who think its funny to make fun of people who are disabled. I was staying at Le Meridian (less than 100 ft away from the restaurant) and called explaining to them that I could not walk and was hoping to get a delivery. The first manager Garth put me on hold 5 times before coming back laughing hysterically saying that no they would not do that. I asked if they had a service (Grubhub, Fooda, etc) who could help me and he repeated ""we will not deliver to you"". After speaking to the wonderful people at my hotel they said they would go and get it so I called back and spoke to Olivia, she put me on hold 3 times before abandoning me there the 4th time. Finally I spoke to manager Renee who with all the attitude in the world told me basically I was SOL because they weren't taking my CC over the phone and unless I was physically present there was nothing they would be willing to do to help! UNBELIEVABLE! Since when is it okay to talk to customers or potential customers this way? Since when do we not try to help customers who are disabled and unable to do things the way everyone else does? Do they really believe I wouldn't WANT to show up at a restaurant like a normal person? The staff has left me in tears. So next time you would like to go there please think of someone you care about who may be disabled and think of how you would feel if they were stuck alone in a hotel room and the restaurant in the same parking lot not only REFUSED TO HELP them but made fun of them and laughed at them like what they were asking was some kind of a joke.

Decor a little gaudy.   They started us with warm bread and big glasses of water.  The bread was good.  The dark bread had a tinge of sweetness.  We ordered the meatloaf and the shepherd's pie.  Both were very generous portions. The meatloaf was good and came with mashed potatoes and succotash.  The meatloaf and succotash were spicy. The shepherd's pie was the best made with beef I have ever had. They used plenty of ground beef and it was filled with a lot of gravy and vegetables including mushrooms, carrots and peas.  The mashed potatoes were topped with a thin coating of melted cheese.   The service was attentive and friendly, although the shepherd's pie does take a little longer.   What we ordered was really a dinner not a lunch and we were stuffed.  So we took a couple of original cheesecakes to go to have with a lighter dinner that night.  And it was excellent.  We will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=300

It was great for my Mom and I, but my poor sisters had to wait the full hour and 45 minutes!!  Luckily, we were not in any kind of rush. Our server was so overwhelmed with tables. We were told it was their second busiest night of the year. It took 20 minutes to get our soda's and waters. When our food came out, they forgot our order of sweet potato fries. The server told us they would not be on our bill (since they finally came out when we were boxing up our food).  When we got the bill, not only were the sweet potato fries on it, but so was the $3 diet coke that my sister paid for when she got a drink at the bar during her nearly 2 hour wait. We had to explain to the server that the bar tender made it clear that her drink would have free refills once she go to the table. Our server apologized and took off the drink, fries, and our dessert. As he should have!!! We were at our table for full two hours.

Sandy K.,"Fox Valley, IL",82,88,1,2.0,12/19/2011,"Awful service. Not to be a baby, but at one point I felt  the""angry tears"" coming on.  See, Hubby and I haven't had a chance to get out in a long time. I tried for rezzies at some more upscale places like Wildfire and Gibsons but I was out of luck. We settled on the Factory but I wasn't dissappointed because I was in the mood for eating and was looking forward to the dessert.  This CF has a really amazing ambiance. It's pretty dramatic and I'm an ambiance girl for sure so that was a plus. The place is ginormous.  Soon as we were seated our server walked up to us and barely looking at us mumbles that he isn't going to be our server for long because he'd already been there all day! Practically warning us that our service is going to be shotty. GREAT! Just what I wanted to hear on our one big night out. He takes our food order, we order a bottle of wine to celebrate a night away from the kiddos and the server comes back to TOSS a basket of bread on our table again without even looking at us and walks/ no runs away. We didn't even have any bread plates. He avoided eye contact with us each time he quickly walked past so we ended up eating our bread off of our napkins. SUCKY! Sitting there like hostages still without our wine, and eating bread off of napkins, we hear the two different servers on either side of us entertaining their guests with the specials and soups of the day which we of course heard nothing of!! Damn because they sounded interesting. After about 10 minutes our food is brought out (which is faster than the last time I went to Burger King) by another server whom I've never seen. Then  Mr. I-CANT-WAIT-TO-PUNCH-OUT-FROM-MY-SHIFT-SERVER makes eye contact for the first time and he introduces us to our ""NEW""  server who is now the third person we've seen. Three of them at our table and not one of them notices we never got our wine, had no bread plates, no water.. they are fine with it and ready to get rid of us asap.  And there is where my ""angry tears"" almost started.  Hubby and I were thinking about forgetting the wine but server #3 promises to get it. After server #2  and #3 do some bumbling and bumping into each other all confused like for a minute, #2 finally brings the bottle after we are well into our meals.  It was stressful, annoying and I felt pretty angry that our bill was over $100 with tip for two people and we were treated like we were at Chilis, where our bill is usually half that. Wait, We get MUCH better service at Chilis!  I had the Bang Bang Shrimp and it was good, It was like a sweeter version of Panaang, if I am ever forced to go to the Factory again that is what I'll order.

The only downside is how crowded this location is most evenings, every weekend, and often during the lunch hour.  Waits can be very long.

We had to go back and remind them we still waiting two more times before we were finally seated at 9:30.  What really burns me is that I am convinced we were never on the waiting list to begin with, instead of just admitting they had made a mistake, and seating us as soon as possible they acted like we were being unreasonable.  When we were finally shown to a table, the lobby was empty and a couple that had just come in was seated before us!

Yes Ii said it, bare foot. No shoe or sock, just toes. He walked right up to the counter passed the 20 or so people who were waiting to be seated and requested a table.

Alicia K.,"Fresno, CA",17,157,45,2.0,5/12/2011,"I'd like to start out by making something clear: in all of my past experiences, I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory!  I've been to 5 different locations in CA as well as one in WI, so I assumed this one would be about the same as the others since they tend to be very consistent in their layout, service, food, etc.  I was so, SO wrong... I would honestly NEVER go back to this place.  We waited an hour for our table at 9pm on Friday night - not unheard of, but pretty annoying when after we put our name in, we watched 3 other parties of two walk in, put their name in, and be seated while we still sat there waiting.  Not cool, people.  The second we complained they said, ""Oh yeah... you're actually next!""  Riiiiight... Then there was our server, Laurie, who was, in a word, TERRIBLE.  She was rude, never smiled, took our cups and appetizer/bread plates before we were done eating without asking us if we were through, and never once stopped by to see how we liked our food, refill our drinks, etc.  Also, after devouring an appetizer and a smoothie before my main meal, I didn't eat much of my dinner and she said in the snarkiest voice I can imagine, ""Guess you're not hungry, huh?""  Seriously?!  SO RUDE.  The food was also meh.  My husband ordered a steak which he has had before at other Factory's and loved.  This one, however, made Applebee's steaks look like fine dining and was cooked all the way through despite a request for ""medium rare.""  My sandwich had fresh ingredients, but the bread was no better than your $.79 Wonder Bread from the grocery store.  Subpar!  And the delicious brown bread they bring to your table when you arrive was day-old at best and in fact tasted rather stale.  Big let down for us.  I will mention that the banana cream cheesecake was as delicious as ever.  At least they have those recipes standardized... The bathrooms were disgusting.  I thought they normally had a schedule and people were supposed to clean it?  You wouldn't know that at this place. Anyway, overall, we didn't leave hungry and the food wasn't terrible, but compared to every other Cheesecake Factory we've been to, it was a horrible experience.  With all the options in the Oak Brook/Lombard area, I would seriously give this one a miss... unless all you want is a really good piece of cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=320
Danny Y.,"Westlake Village, CA",8,190,,4.0,11/9/2011,"My usual go-to dish at the Cheesecake Factory is their Sheppards Pie. On this (diet) night, I opted for something from the healthy menu, which must be new because I dont remember seeing this couple months ago. I ordered the crusted salmon, which was a bit of a disappointment. It wasn't dry, but wasn't juicy either. I'll give this a 3/5. Wife ordered the Thai wraps, her go-to dish. This dish is less of an appetizer and more of a meal. If you're into peanut sauce, and making your own lettuce wrapped rolls, you'll love this dish. 4/5. We also ordered the ahi tuna carpaccio, which is probably the highlight of the night. I'm pretty sure they topped the carpaccio with spicy mayo which is brilliant. It was like eating grade-A sashimi, and we LOVE sashimi. Nevertheless, I do want to caution folks and say that while the dish is good, it won't do much to satisfy your hunger. Anyway, the carpaccio is easily 5/5 in my book! Ended the night with an ice cream sundae, which tasted like every other ice cream sundae I've ever ordered (plus whip cream and a cherry).

I did research the day before so I wouldn't take 3 hours to figure out what I wanted once we sat down.

The wait was not too bad for a Friday about 5:30p but the place was packed by the time we left. The hostess asked if an indoor table was okay, we said it was, and then she promptly seated us outside.  At least it was a nice night and the view of the traffic in the parking lot was wonderful. We split a chopped salad.  It was ok - there was not as much bacon as I would have liked. I had the Cuban sandwich.  The pork was dry and it was just not very good.  The fries were excellent.   My wife had a chicken and pasta dish.  She said it was gross and ate about a 1/4 of it.  The sauce was orange and looked suspiciously like it came directly from a can of Spaghettios. The server could have been more attentive with our drinks. Bottom line: 1. This is a great place for a gangbanger to bring his girlfriend for a ""nice"" dinner.   2.

The food is tasty but definitely not worth the price though with that, you always have leftovers at the end of the night. I'm not a huge fan of taking food home at the end of night.  Trying to get a seat anytime on the weekends can be maddening. I would suggest maybe a lunchtime run. Any other time you're fighting with the mall shoppers for a seat and waits can be over an hour and a half. The last time I went here I was a little disappointed. We had ordered the Buffalo wings as an appetizer. When you think Buffalo wings, images of crispy fried wings dripping in hot sauce come to mind. Not here. we had the wings with a tiny little container of hot sauce. Seriously, for two people that was not enough. With the prices they charge for an appetizer, there should be more than that on the wings. I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo for an entree. It was good but nothing spectacular.

Each Cheesecake Factory has a theme to it.  I always wondered why they chose an Egyptian theme for this particular restaurant located on the pad of Oak Brook Mall, but it is nice to look at nonetheless.   If you go at lunch- plan to wait as they do not take reservations.  A hint for all of you:  If you don't mind eating at a hightop in the bar and are willing to gamble that no one is smoking- you can be seated right away.  I often do this and have never had an issue with anyone smoking. Their menu is more like a shopping catalog.  Every other page is an ad for something over at the Mall.  But the menu itself if so diverse, that you can find anything you or anyone in your party wants.  Another hint?  Order the luncheon size portion whenever available as the portions are huge!  And always- ALWAYS save room for a piece of cheesecake! (I always plan to do this but never do as I am always stuffed!) The salads and sandwiches are all very good.  Every day there are fish specials (usually salmon and mahi mahi) which you can get blackened or grilled.

All of my 6 co-workers really liked it. I have not been to the other locations, but I have been told that this Oak Brook location is big compared to the others. For my taste, I thought the food was only okay. I went with my family and we ordered and tried a little bit of each others food. Food - The warm crab and artichoke dip was very good. I ordered the Big Bang Shrimp and Chicken. For me it was not spicy enough and a little bit on the sweet side. The portabella burger was not that special, although I did like the sweet potato fries. The Spicy Beef was okay, but I did not think it all that different from something you could get at a regular Chinese restaurant. Desserts- Well the desserts were indeed good, but I think they lack a balance. For example, I ordered the Lemoncello torte and it did have a strong lemon flavor, but it overpowered the mascarpone cheese it had in it. No balance in the flavors, although it was good. The Godiva Chocolate cheescake was indeed very strong in flavor, but again I though the chocolate overpowered the ""cheescake"" flavor and so it was just a pure chocolate flavor and no ""cheesecake"" flavor. It was very creamy though. I did not try the tiramisu, but heard it was good. I think the portions are big, but it's embarrassing to admit that my family is able to finish all the food on his/her plate. Although we took our desserts to go because we were full.  Prices - seem a little high for food that was not bad, but not overly spectacular either.

Michelle C.,"Riverside, IL",27,123,9,3.0,9/9/2011,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory; if you've been to one, you've been to all. No great shakes here, just American fare food with Asian and Mediterranean inspired dishes. They have a good variety on their menu, and the location of this Oak Brook location can't be beat. We were able to sit outside on this day too, which was nice expecially because the chairs outside are pretty comfy.  However, the HUGE downside to this visit was the insane amount of times the server came around. I like good customer service anywhere, but when I'm out to lunch with a friend deep in conversation, the staff should take a cue and leave us alone. Even my friend made a comment to me about it, and I'm ususally more critical than she is.  Would I return?

Margaret G.,"Chicago, IL",54,119,7,2.0,1/19/2013,"Cheesecake Factory's menu boasts an all inclusive menu. You want a burger. No prob. Salad? Sure! Tacos? Coming right up! Fish? Ok we've got shrimp, salmon, or tuna. If one can't find anything on the menu that suits you, clearly you aren't hungry enough. They serve a myriad of classic meals without any innovative twists and serve any kind of cheesecake you could imagine.     Why the 2 stars?     Holy hell bad service! We celebrated two of my friends birthdays, filling up three of the big booths in the back of the restaurant. We had a large group. Our server waited on two of the booths. On multiple occasions during our meal, the server seemed clueless, overwhelmed, and just no where to be seen. And it is at times such as these, where an automatic 18% tip is added that really gets my goat. Upon the main dishes being served to my booth of 7, my friend was left empty handed. So we all sat and waited, expecting her burger to be following close behind. 2 minutes passed. 5 more. 15 minutes! No waiter. No food. WTH? Finally her burger arrived brought by a wait staff not our own. No apologies offered. Two of my friends needed a to go box for their slices of cheesecake. Where is said waiter? MIA. After finally becoming inpatient with the nonexistent service, my friends gets up from the table and fetches containers herself.     Theme of the night- Incredibly slow, inattentive service that kinda put a black cloud on my whole experience.

Ray T.,"Westmont, IL",0,236,3,4.0,12/20/2012,"My wife's retirement party was here.  The reservations were for noon.  The place was packed, but the reservation was handled well.  It wasn't long before orders were being taken and the orders got back to the table correctly - individual checks too.  Many places do not like to do this with groups. I am a picky eater and sometimes have difficulty finding items on a menu.  The menu here is HUGE  over 16 pages.  It has a large variety from which to choose.  I had no trouble finding many items that I could eat. The food was good.  We heard no complaints about quality and a few complaints about quantity.  Portion sizes were large.  My wife and I ordered the Kobe burger with salad on the side and onion rings.  The rings were good and abundant.  One order would have been enough for both my wife and I.  Of course the taste of those rings made it impossible to leave any remaining on the table.  A few were given away; the rest devoured.  The Kobe burger was large and good and correctly cooked to order. I arrived before my wife and her coworkers and had a beer in the bar.  The bartender was friendly, service was quick.  We chatted a bit as is common with all good bartenders.  Later when my wife and one of her coworkers arrived, the bartender congratulated my wife's retirement.  Remembering little things is good business.  Table service was good too.  Ordering, food delivery, processing multiple individual checks was handled well by friendly and attentive staff. The decor is attractive and the place is loud, but not so loud that you couldn't hear a conversation several seats away from you at the table. Oh yeah...the cheesecake.   I don't eat any, but my wife is eating one now as I write this.  She took her cheesecake home for dinner.  Others ate theirs entirely or split the cheesecake - half for eating/half to take home.  They are are big cheesecakes. I just asked my wife how her cheesecake is and she said ""Pretty darn good."" That's really the gist of it ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=340
Charles J.,"Oswego, IL",230,138,133,3.0,6/28/2011,"To clarify, the number of stars is based on their overall menu and entree options.  Were I reviewing them strictly on the basis of their cheesecake, I'd give them SIX stars. Cheesecake Factory is hugely busy, which should be an indication you'll get a decent meal and, if you have any room left in your belly, outstanding desserts! I've eaten dinner there several times and have always left stuffed due to their gargantuan portions, but seldom ""wow'd"".  The food, if not the portions, is somewhat pedestrian.  It's a touristy place, especially the Michigan Avenue location to be sure so expect long waits (they don't take reservations). My secret to getting right in is to avoid prime time.  Go during a week day or mid-afternoon, when everyone else is out doing something else.  Your chances of getting in right away improves dramatically. Our most recent visit was to the Oakbrook location for dessert only - specifically, CHEESE CAKE.  I can personally recommend the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake.  Fabulous!  Others in my party loved the Raspberry Truffle and the Caramel Cheesecake. So, level set your expectations accordingly; 1. prepare for a long wait for a table. 2. expect a mega menu. 3. expect the food to be OK but not live up to the hype of the place.. 4. save room for cheesecake! 5. expect an expensive night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=340
Lizzie B.,"Naperville, IL",46,5,,2.0,7/19/2014,"Been here on a few occasions, and I will say the last time was the absolute worst. Sure, the cheesecake is great, however, the staff is rude and unfriendly. We came during a dinner rush and sat near the registers where many of the staff would gather to input orders and print out receipts. This was fine until we could hear the rude remarks the wait staff was making about other customers, and then later we heard them complaining about our party. After we had asked to speak to the manager, we were treated worse, and the manager did not even give a care and simply wrote off a single entree and gave a meaningless apology. During the dinner, I had gone to use the restroom and found that only one stall was clean; the other had someone's period and tampon on the ground and around the seat. I immediately told the two hostess's and explained how awful it is and how it needs to be cleaned up and that the toilet paper also needed to be restocked. First, they were rude because I had interrupted their personal conversation, and second, they barley took attention to my complaint and then waved me off. I understand how working in food service is, and how stressful it can be. However, this is incredibly unacceptable. I expected more professionalism and a cleaner environment, especially for the price that is being paid.

I  wasn't looking for a discount I just want them to appreciate their customers more. I have not gone back to that location since until yesterday what a mistake that was I called to make reservations for 25 people, the lady that answered the phone said they do not make reservation but to just come in because they were not busy. When we got there we were told that we would have to wait about an hour and a half to be seated in separate areas. Unfortunately with a large group  it isn't that easy to just leave to another restaurant so we chose to wait . While we waited another large group walked in and told them they had reservations the lady told them their seats we're almost ready. After I heard that I asked to speak to a manager and was basically told they do take reservations  but since I didn't know the persons name I spoke with over the phone they couldn't do anything for me. After about an hour wait they finally seated us that was my mistake we should have just left.

Katie W.,"Lancaster, PA",28,92,1,3.0,10/9/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory should be noted for it's HUGE menu, GIANT portions, MASS appeal. But note, what do each of these three adjectives have in common? They are all synonyms for BIG or FAT.  What really gets me about the Cheesecake Factory is that after countless appeals and the fact that most other national chain restaurants provide nutritional information (some would like it to be required by law), The Cheesecake Factory refuses to do so. Most speculate they do not because their percentage of fat and calories are absurdly high and people would start feeling guilty about dining here. But, I wish they could still be honest about the food that they serve.  With that out in the air, my experience with service at the Oak Brook location has been okay. But on my last visit, I was going for a quick dinner at the bar, where they serve ""light' portions of meals at awesome prices. I love their Thai Wraps, and wanted to get the happy hour priced portion (for like $4.00 you can't resist!). Upon arriving, I mentioned I was here for happy hour and the hostess told me to pick a seat in the bar area.  It took nearly 10 minutes for a waiter to even come to our high top table to ask us what we wanted to drink. (the bar tender meanwhile was behind the bar 2 feet away from us reading the paper!). We ordered our food. I pointed at the bar menu listing of the smaller portion discounted Thai Wraps when I ordered.  It takes quite awhile for even our glasses of wine comes. The waiters excuse was ""oh sorry, I was in the back chatting with the manager"". um okay?  When we got our order, my Thai Wraps were HUGE, definitely not the small happy hour protion. I noted this, and the waiter said ""yes, they're always that big"". So, I gave him the benefit of  the doubt. This was the first time I had ordered them at the Oak Brook location.  But low and behold, once we got our bill I was charged the full price. We I asked the waiter, he said that he was sorry. that's it. I asked if we could be charged the Happy Hour price and he said ""I guess I could ask the manager, but you already ate it"".  UGH, because I already questioned HIM about it! Why else would we sit in the bar, say we were there for happy hour, order off the happy hour menu, and then ask why it was so big when it came? Okay, but that was just one experience.

Now for the anecdote - Yesterday, my coworker picked this location for our end of year luncheon.  We had a larger party (9) so I expected to wait.  But we arrived at 11:30 to a newly opened, mostly empty restaurant and we still waited 20 minutes to sit down.  Once we finally saw a waiter and finally received our drinks, I noticed my glass had a huge 'how can you not notice that?' crack in it.  The glass was promptly replaced but it still stunk of the staff not really caring about their product or presentation.  Then, after placing our appetizer and food order we had 3 different dudes come to our table to assure us our food was on the way (how about one of ya's go make it?).  We finally got the appetizers and the fried macaroni and cheese balls were, as always, the hit of the meal.  I repeat, the appetizer was the best part of the meal.  I had the blue cheese BLT burger.  It was a tasty burger and cooked to my order so that was good.  I ordered a side salad opposed to fries and the lettuce/weeds in the salad were so soggy it was unedible.  We didn't have dessert but I've had the cheesecake here before and they have a lot of options and it has always been very good.

Sorry, I work in the business and I know the first rule...broken chipped glass...free drink! I was drinking ice tea during dinner, one glass mind you. As it was kind of cold I wanted hot tea.

I actually have a taste for it right now ummm! Most port sandwiches tend to tast the same but cheesecake does something fancy to theres because it has a taste all its own. If you are feeling like being a fatty you HAVE TO order the macaroni balls they are the tastiest,cheesiet balls of joy you will ever have! My mom always gets the chicken romano and she swears its one of the best chicken dishes ever and my dad sometimes gets the meatloaf tower thing which he gives 5 stars! After you consume 3000+ calories you have to get cheesecake!You really have no choice.One+ is that they have a sugar free cheesecake that is suprisinly delish! So get that and you wont feel so bad about everything you ate:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=380

To my horror I ate 1/2 of the shrimp and only saw the remains of its limp little vein hanging. I was almost ready to forgive that one mishap until I ran across another shrimp on my plate wearing a little black sash of disgust. I think I just threw-up a little in my mouth just now. Great mashed potatoes if your into the chunky, red-skinned kind. Decent portion sizes. Interesting decor, aside from the super dim lighting.  Our server was excellent, super attentive and apologetic.

Just the right amount of dressing. The burger was decent but I have had better. I asked for it to be prepared medium and it came out medium well. Not a good start. Although there was blue cheese on it, I couldn't taste the distinct sharp flavor. So all in all, kind of a bland burger.  Our server was good and the interior was beautiful with the Egyptian theme.

Obviously my favorite thing to eat here is DESSERT!  I do not eat any cheesecake except cheesecake factory cheesecake, its more similar to chocolate mousse than cheesecake in my opinion.  I've sampled a ton of cheesecakes and I love the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, it's my favorite.

The food is good but not great, the cheesecake, which they are known for is great, if you like cheesecake.  The Cheesecake Factory is notorious for huge portions and meals high in fat and calories. What has boosted this establishment in my view is the effort to change that image. They have established a new skinny menu. The insert to their regular menu includes the calories for the meals , allowing diners to make healthier food choices if they so wish.  I choose to eat healthier and opted to eat off that menu. I had the artichoke appetizer. It turned our fabulous. Very tender and flavorful with out all the added fat and calories.  If you have been avoiding the Factory for the high calories and fat I challenge you to try their new menu.

One person took our reservation, another seated us, a third took our orders, yet another person served our food. We had avocado egg rolls with a tamarisk/cashew sauce; fantastic! I had breaded fried shrimp that were really good sized and delicious. They were served with Cole Slaw and French fries. I did not eat all of the sides. My wife had Huevos Ranchero. She was very pleased. My wife's dessert order was delivered incorrectly. The mistake could be equally blamed on my wife and the waitress.  Soon after we were seated other guests were seated at the neighboring tables. Those tables were less than a foot away. Even though they were talking quietly I could easily hear their conversations.

Are they all this big?  We were there on a Saturday night without a reservation, and were still seated within an hour which, considering how packed it was, I consider a plus.  We ordered the buffalo wings as an appetizer and I had a glass of Riesling.  It was actually really good for being a 7ish dollar glass of wine.  The buffalo wings were good even though I don't really like buffalo wings.  For our main courses I had the Steak Diane and my date had the memphis burger.  My steak was really good - not too tough despite being cooked medium (sacreligious, i know, but i don't like uncooked meat) and the sauce had a really good flavor to it with the carmelized onions.  I didn't have any of my friend's burger, but it was huge and he couldn't finish it.   Our waitress was ok.  She brought our main courses like a minute and a half after she brought the buffalo wings, which isn't her fault at all, I just don't like when restaurants do this.  She didn't know if they had a Bordeaux which, with a menu as huge as the one here, is fine.  She brought me the wine list and I ordered, but didn't bring over the wine until I was mostly done with my steak.  We ordered cheesecake, and it was nice that we didn't feel rushed even though they were obviously packed.  I guess they're used to it.   It was a nice experience, but ultra touristy.  It was fun having a whole meal leftover to take home though, because the portions are enormous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=380

I'm pretty sure i've only eaten at a Cheesecake Factory about three times total.  And no, i'm not gonna dog the place b/c it's a chain, that would be predictable and silly.  I will call the place out b/c it's not all that great, however.   The highlight of the meal was straight off the jump, which was the appetizer: chicken potstickers.  WOW! Absolutely sensational!!! (and the only reason this place gets an extra star).  I was so in love w these delectable little dumplings, I almost threw my Cuban sammy out and ordered another for my main.   As noted, I went w the Cuban which was on the reco of our server; it was b/t that or the turkey club.  It was decidedly mediocre and came w a ton of ham and pork, both of which were ok, a decent sear but the pork was a little fatty.  The bread was the main let-down, it had a croissant like and flimsy texture and did a poor job imitating an authentic crusty breaded Cuban.  The accompanying fries were a basic fry w.out any seasoning whatsoever, but I was starving and ate almost all of them.   The wife went the fish & chips and the breading was thick and hard...great if you're a women involved in intercourse, not so much when describing the textured breading of a decent fish & chip.  My sister had the Santa Fe Salad, which was huge and probably the best of all our meals.  And speaking of, i'll give this place credit for consistency, every thing from the menu to the portion sizes to the space itself: All over-the-top big (too much so, imo).

The service has been horrible each time. The first time a group of about 8 servers were just hanging out in the bar area playing on their phones. One server  was hugging all of the girls and the hosts were laughing so loud with each other we could hear them goofing around all the way on the other side of the restaurant. The manager walked by and did not say anything to the servers who were on their phones. With all of these servers there, we had to flag our server down just to get our order taken. The staff looks messy and has crazy hair. For a place that is not cheap, the staff is trashy.  The second time we went it was the same thing, except this time there was a chunk of food on my silverware. Then my beer glass had black specks of something in it. I asked for a new one that was okay. Then my second beer glass had the same. I have worked in the restaurant business for many years and have never seen such loose management. We could here the staff swearing to each other and using their phones during our whole mean.  I only will return because the specials are great, but it is a shame the staff is ruining this place. Especially in an economy like this. The management should all be replaced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=420

Our waitress was a bit wooden and hardly came to check on us, but we received our food in a timely fashion.   As you know, the portions are huge so be ready to share!  I got the crispy chicken taquitos and my other friends just got desert.   Overall, I would say Cheesecake Factory is good if you are hungry, but willing to wait.  My food is always consistent and I never leave without a full tummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=420

If you can possibly find something to chose to split- do so- you will not make it to the cheesecake! Their menu is monsterous, you need 20 minutes just to make a choice!

Ebru Y.,"Orange County, CA",37,248,33,3.0,6/27/2006,"First of all, for such a gorgeous and very appetizing restaurant like this, they need to have a good manager with professional hiring experience/skills. And he or she needs to start by giving that hostess at the door an attitude adjustment! I cannot believe how rude some people get when the income they make is coming straight out of that customer's pocket. I am not saying they need to worship the customers and bow down in front but have some respect at least! We walked in here because I was in the area for an interview, and wanted to grab a quick lunch before my interview. We walked up to say we need a table for 2, and she was just giving us this blank look as if we are the employees and she is the customer. She was like ""Yeah?"" and then she was like, ok you'll need to move and wait over there pointing away from where she was standing, and we wanted to ask about sitting outside, and she just cut us off saying, okay you need to go wait over there pointing, as if we are some animals, you don't even treat an animal like that! Other than this rude person, the food was awesome as usual, it's a huge place with a lot of space, you could have a wedding reception here lol Our waitress was very nice and friendly. The only other thing is, each time somebody came to our table, to take the order, to bring the food, bring the bill, take the bill, ring up the sale, bring us water, it was another person. So it was kind of not fair to tip only one person. To me this is kind of absurd. Let one person do the work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oak-brook?start=460

Granted it is not a formal dining experience, but for what it is I definitely think it deserves 5 stars!!! They have good martini's and they have the largest menu I have ever seen. You can have breakfast, sandwiches, pasta, Mexican, soup, tons of salads, so many appetizers..... however, I always order the same meal. It is one of my favorite all time meals. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their fish tacos!!! They are the best fish tacos I have ever had. And anywhere I go, I will eat fish tacos (unless the fish is fried and breaded)... but they grill the fish, and the tacos are so light.  OMG and I read some of these reviews.... small portions? WOW! I can only eat one taco - and there are 3 HUGE tacos.  I have had other items on the menu sampling my friends meals, and I have never had anything I didn't think was good. And of course their Cheesecakes....but I am not sure how anyone manages to eat a piece of cheesecake after the meal, I always just take it home.  This location is really big, and no matter how crowded it is, it never feels crowded, and the bar is  huge, so plenty of room while you wait. * AS A SIDE NOTE *  I do not like the Woodfield location - I have experienced a few episodes with the rude waiters / waitresses.

Angie G.,"Chicago, IL",3,77,,4.0,4/5/2010,"Why am I writing a review for a place that already has 40? Oy. As far as chain restaurants go, The Cheesecake Factory is decent. It's one of my mom's favories, so we stand in long lines on Mother's Day for her. I just ate lunch with a friend at the Oak Brook location, and ultimately it wasn't a bad deal. I had a tostada salad (something like that) and it was literally piled high. Literally. I had two piles of lettuce and cilatro, tomatoes, black beans, and avocado cream. Yum. Huge portions are their thing, but this was by far the largest portion I've ever had at any cheesecake factory. The sandwiches and burgers here--I've had nearly all of them--are your average, run-of-the-mill sandwiches and burgers. Nothing remarkable, but nothing terrible. All are pretty forgetable. The cheesecakes here are almost always superb, which is good, because it makes you forget your sub-par meal. My one complaint is that half the darn slice is covered in whipped cream. Dis.Gus.Ting. Even when I've asked--at multiple locations, mind you--I always get large mounds of whipped cream on my cheesecake. It's clearly company policy, but WHY???? Cheesecake don't need no frills. For a decent meal and a place that will satisfy everyone, this is the place to go.

K G.,"Berkeley, CA",7,95,6,4.0,11/3/2009,"Back when I was vehemently a Bay Area ""anti-chain"" person, I would have given this a bad review just for being a chain. In fact, because the CF was so darn popular when they first appeared on the scene sometime in the early 90's, I avoided them for just that reason alone. Well, the other reason being that they were always crowded and don't take reservations; they would like you to have to shop the mall or wait and look at the cakes before you eat. Okay, so having said all that, this place really does a great job. It's a top quality chain. For one thing, they have the consistency down pat, almost as well as MacDonalds. Really! They always look the same, beautiful decor with the perfect lighting. You will always feel warm and cozy and romantic here. It's the right amount of noise, and privacy in every table and booth. Wonderful job, designers. Atmosphere is always perfect. I really enjoyed sitting outside at the Oakbrook Mall in September, with the heat lamps too! Service is always outstanding. They again emphasize consistency here, friendly, upbeat, not pushy, service. I love how they are happy to split something like a salad or cake without making you feel like a cheapskate. They put it on two plates without even asking. I think that the food is good. You can get any type of food you want; Italian, American, Mexican, even sort of Nouvelle Cuisine for some of the special entrees. The sauces are yummy, again totally consistent, and the quality is good. In addition, I don't think it's a terribly expensive place. I liked the Mac and Cheese a lot (lots of garlic), I loved the fajitas, and the scampi. I also really like their sandwiches and appreciate the willingness to totally alter whatever is on the menu to suit my picky tastes with no questions or frowns! Of course, their cakes are wonderful too. I love the red velvet cake the best. It's a sure thing. Good job, guys. Keep up the good work!
