Eythan T.,"Davis, OK",112,35,,5.0,11/11/2017,"We came here after an event, and as expected, it looked packed. We walked in, and the hosts were very hospitable, patient and kind. Our waitress, Amanda, was patient as well (some in our party require it lol). We never had an empty cup the entire time we sat. She diligently checked on us every chance she got, without being annoying.  Our table ordered the chicken Madeira, the gumbo, the Evelyn's with angel hair and the Cajun nuggets. Everyone was absolutely astounded. It was great. Four of the six of us had never been here, but all were greatly impressed. I don't understand why this location only has 3 stars.  Thanks, Amanda!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city
Donna C.,"Edmond, OK",162,55,26,3.0,1/7/2018,"For a chain restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory has pretty good food. The menu is a book with everything you could possibly think of. I've tried several of their dishes, but the only category that I found quite disappointing in taste and texture was the pasta. The wheat bread and butter is delicious. I'm not a fan of sourdough, so I am biased with my opinion on that. With our 20 minute wait, it gave my party plenty of time to look at the menu and pick our entrees. When we were seated, we ordered our drinks and went ahead and ordered our entrees to make things easier on our server (including a bowl of lemons for our water, straws, and extra bread). Service took a while. And we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the items listed above. Food was good. I got the steak with salmon with a side of mashed potatoes and corn succotash. The asparagus were wilted and the size of match sticks. My family's entrees were also satisfying in taste. The server clearly forgot to put in an order and said under her breath as she was thinking, ""I'll get that out as soon as possible."" Not recognizing that she was at fault for this... (We're usually understanding and nice when we dine out, but I'll judge if you play it off like we forgot to tell you!!!)... so that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth.  Anywho, we finished out entrees, already had our meals boxed up and bagged. The server comes back with the missed order and told us it was actually taken to another table and they had to make a new one. Thanks?? We're clearly full. I was hoping it would get comped since we ordered this from the beginning, she had forgotten, and it came out when we were about to leave. We obviously paid it and took it togo... Tonight, it wasn't worth the hassle to even mention it. Justified that bad taste in my mouth, but.... whatevs. I noticed there's never a manager that walks around asking how things are going whenever I've visited. Cheesecake has always been divine. I recommend the Kahlua or the lemon raspberry.  Overall, the price is expensive so, expect to easily rack up your bill. I would come back only to order cheesecake or if invited in a group without say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city
Mary Margaret M.,"Edmond, OK",72,147,2415,3.0,12/8/2017,"Classic Cheesecake Factory experience here: everything and the kitchen sink is on their menu. It's all served family style (one order is enough for a family of three-across the board).  My staple is the Louisiana chicken pasta. It's so subtly spicy and flavorful and a HUGE portion. One time at this location we found a hair (an obvious ""there's no way it's mine"" hair) in this dish. Staff was apologetic. They removed it from our check and replaced the dish with another one, which was the acceptable way to handle the situation.  Recently tried the Nashville chicken appetizer and it was good. I like the flavor-there could have been more pickles and a lot less grease.  Recently tried the Tuscan chicken from the Skinny-licious menu. There was enough meal there for 3 people; completely shareable for dinner for two with leftovers. The farro was skimpy, but I guess that's where the Skinny-licious part comes in. It was served with tons of tomatoes and had great flavor.  Cheesecake Factory cheesecake is universal at all locations, which I appreciate. Love the white chocolate raspberry. Recently learned a piece of cheesecake is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000-ish calories. Plan ahead and bring a cheesecake buddy (or several) who have similar tastes to you, or plan to take a week to eat it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city
Jeff M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",423,586,1166,3.0,8/21/2017,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) is where willpower and waistlines go to die. And my goodness, it's so easy to fail at any healthy eating attempts if this place becomes a frequent stop for you. Supposedly, their 250 menu items are made from scratch daily, which makes me want to know what their definition of ""from scratch"" is more than anything. Prices have gone up though, so really, this is increasingly becoming a great place to get your dessert fix only, since there are definitely better options for dining out, even by chain restaurant standards. Our meal with family ended up being just slightly shy of $140. That's Cheever's money at that point. Speaking of increased prices... This happened yesterday: [] Update at the bottom of this essay [] I ordered something called the ""Crispy Chicken Costoletta"" listed on the menu at $17.95. ""Whatever"" I thought, since most everything on the menu is in that range. I figured the portions were going to be massive, so yay. Then the bill arrived, and I noticed that I was charged $19.45 for the CCC.  So I ask my server for clarification. I even had to point it out on the menu because he didn't seem like he believed me. A few minutes later, he comes back and tells me that his manager said that the prices had gone up on a number of the menu items by ""just a dollar"" (it's more than a dollar, but who's counting? Besides me...). And then he asked if it would be okay for me to go ahead and pay the $19.45. lolwut?  There were a number of options on how to deal with the price change(s):         (a) Take the low-effort Asian restaurant route, and cover the old price with a sticker.         (b) Eat the cost of your mistake, and fix the price when requested by the customer.         (c) Ask the customer politely to accept your bait & switch. He actually chose (c) and with manager approval too, it seems. I mean, yes, it's only $1.50, but I was like ""WTH?"" to even being told:  - Yeah, our prices changed...  - Yeah, we didn't note it anywhere...  - Yeah, could you go ahead and just pay the new price? No, guy. No. I mean, thanks for asking so nicely, but this was like the easiest customer-service resolution ever, and you botched it. And this weak-sauce customer service thing is the one thing (other than the delicious cheesecake) that seems to be oddly consistent about this TCF in particular. Man, this review got long...  P. S. I had someone from ""Guest Services"" reach out to me, to explain that you cannot do any substitutions. At all. The server had told me that I could swap out the mashed potatoes for the corn succotash, and it turns out that... You can't... So, yeah... Crispy Chicken Costoletta ($17.95) + Corn Succotash ($1.50) = $19.45. Okay, fair enough...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city
Johna R.,"Edmond, OK",28,77,53,3.0,9/30/2017,"This is a great place for dinner if you have a family or group because their menu is extensive!  We had the fried macaroni and cheese to start and it was amazing! You get 4 balls and can easily share each one with someone. I had the skinnylicious (under 600 calories) burger and green salad. It was good, but nothing to write home about. The green salad was just lettuce. No other veggies were on the salad. I thought that was odd and the dressing they poured on it made the greens a little soggy.  Our service was okay, a little slow at times. The weather was perfect, which made for an excellent meal on their patio.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city

If you want a restaurant that has a ton of variety, this is your perfect spot! The menu is literally like a book. If you want a meal that is healthy and you are watching calories stick to the skinny licious menu only!! All of their dishes are not known to be the healthiest. Plus they give you delicious warm bread and butter while you wait for your food. I love their butter here it's so fresh.  I got the Renee special which is a half a turkey sandwich, House salad, and a cup of the soup of the day. My soup I got was chicken tortilla which was so cold and just not good at all. It was thicker than tomato soup almost and not a single tortilla chip in it!  The sandwich was fresh and hearty! salad was delicious but they drowned it in salad dressing and I hate when that happens. My waitress was good just slow she definitely wasn't in any hurry.. which is nice opposed to feeling rushed I guess. I just don't like it when you give change or place your order then they walk off and talk to two other tables making small talk.

My wife always gets the Tea, it has a unique flavor with hints of fruit. It gives me the willies so I pass. But go for it if it's your bag. The absolute always order, no questions asked, is the chicken pot stickers as an appetizer. The sauce is spectacular, I never let any go to waste by sponging it up with the delicate stickers or delicious fresh bread. Tonight I was feeling adventurous. So I exchanged my usual, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (I'm a curry junkie) for the Miso Salmon. And let me tell you, it changed my life. Who knew salmon could taste so great in Oklahoma? The fish was fresh, flaked properly, and was covered in a Miso sauce that was oh so creamy fantastic.  I passed on cheesecake tonight. But recommend the Red Velvet.

Olivia T.,"Edmond, OK",145,271,1072,4.0,8/21/2017,"I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory primarily for their vast selection of scrumptious cheesecakes. One of my cheesecake missions in life is to try ALL of their cheesecake flavors and still have all of my teeth and no diabetes. With that in mind, I can only try a new flavor or two every year because my sweet tooth craves different things. I've tried a lot of the flavors on the menu. I'm a huge fan of the raspberry white chocolate truffle, the red velvet, lemon meringue, dulce de leche, salted caramel, celebration cheesecake, and the Adam's peanut butter (in no particular order). The food here is pretty good, but there are places locally in Oklahoma that has better foods, so I don't come here for dinner unless there was a friend's birthday or work event.

My food was excellent. I had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Everything about it was great, but it wasn't as spicy as I wanted it to be. My father had the Chicken Riesling. The taste was meh. It was also really oily. When you took a bite you could just taste the oil coat your mouth. My mom had the Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style. For the most part it was good. It was pretty average, nothing that was really surprising or great about it. My sister had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. Her food was amazing as always. One of the best salads at any restaurant.

C J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",4,30,18,1.0,2/8/2017,This was terrible. Terrible terrible terrible. (Sounds better if you pretend Charles Barkley is saying it) I wanted to grab a quick bite with the family before I headed out town for work. I let my daughter pick and she picked here. This place always sounds better than it is.  From the beginning it was terrible. They asked if I had any children in the party. (I get this. I was single and childless once but. Come on. Let's not be so obvious). I said yes and they sat me in the worst table by the kitchen. I sure hope the waiter I had was new because he was terrible. About 10 minutes from being seated to him coming to the table. Then. He dropped off the menus  and I had to stop him from leaving to give him a drink order. It got worse from there. Like I said. I hope he was new.  The food was gross. My daughter got garlic noodles. Obvious garlic salt and I think they spilled it in there. It was saltier than anything I have ever had. I probably should check my blood pressure.  I had sausage and shrimp. Sauce was terrible and the sausage had about as much a presence as you will see in a women's locker room.  Children's menu was typical of a place that really doesn't want children.  Dessert. Couple pieces of cheese cake. I really do not see what the hype is.  There was obviously no real baker back there.

Lauren A.,"Yukon, OK",55,38,4,3.0,6/15/2017,"EDIT: I've been told that the food doesn't come frozen. Fine and dandy, but it certainly tastes it at this location. There are restaurants in the city where you can taste the freshness of the food for a fraction of the price. And how ""none of the food is frozen"" when they have a menu the size of a Harry Potter book is beyond me.  The food is outrageously overpriced. I'm no fool - this is a chain restaurant. The $20 plates of food come frozen in bags. Tastes good, but not worth the price. I can spend less on a plate at a restaurant that uses fresh ingredients and makes things from scratch.  However, there are two things to come here for: the cheesecake and the appetizers. We all know their cheesecake slays the game. Their appetizers are some of the best I've had at any restaurant and they are large in portion size. The avocado egg rolls and the sauce that comes with them are to die for. And who doesn't love the mac and cheese balls? Ditch the regular menu. You can easily pick an appetizer and just order that as your entree; you'll walk out just as full and you'll probably have spent $10 less per person.  As far as service goes, it's always been decent at this location. This isn't a place I frequent just because of the price outweighing the quality of the food, but I had a gift card and, well, I'm a sucker for a slice of cheesecake the size of my head.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=20

Not the best bloody mary I've had, but it comes with a celery and it was good to go with the meal.  I like that they give you complimentary bread and better. Just the plain small packaged butter. But I really enjoyed the pumpernickel bread! For my main meal, I got the almond crusted salmon salad. They definitely give you a good amount for the price. I was surprised about that. My salmon came on a bed of kale, quinoa, and avacado. It was good, filling, and not heavy on the stomach which is nice!  I also tried the crab hash. It was okay. Again, the portion sizes are decent. But, I didn't really enjoy the potatoes that came along with the dish. It had a weird taste to them.  Overall, the service was good and attentive. Very accommodating to my party of 10, and they even gave the birthday girl a complimentary dessert!  I still have yet to try the cheesecake. Too full.

Jack W.,"Edmond, OK",0,9,,2.0,11/1/2016,"I've always enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory.  The menu is extensive and the portions are large.  I've been to several locations around the country and the food is usually pretty good with the exception of the pizza I had at the location in San Francisco.  That pizza was some of the worst I've ever tasted, in fact, so bad that I actually sent it back and requested another entree. Here are my two issues with this restaurant: 1.   They do not have a traditional New York cheesecake with a firm, dense texture as opposed to more of a pudding like texture.  Very strange indeed. 2.  And, most important to me.  Why do they put the silverware directly on the tables?  That is simply gross.  Interestingly enough, they wrap the eating utensils in a cloth napkin for the outside tables, but do not do so for indoor dining and it just sits on the table itself.  Even IHOP or Denny's will place the eating utensils on paper placemats. I have mentioned this issue to my servers and have even written a comment on their website.  They all say they wipe the tables down, but have you noticed that they use the same wet rag at each table?  I've seen way too many kids and adults putting their hands and arms all over the tables after they cough and sneeze and then, after the table is cleared with this soiled, wet rag, down go the eating utensils for the next party.  It's just not very appetizing.   I can't believe I'm the only patron that has noticed this disgusting practice.  I always request they bring me the ""wrapped"" set of utensils which they do without any protest.  Nevertheless, the practice is a black eye on a mostly decent restaurant if not for this one issue.   To me, until the management resolves this issue, the restaurant only deserves two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=20

Me and my coworkers have made the same mistake over and over of thinking we can come here on our lunch break and not receive terrible service and wait for hours for food and then the check.  But we like cheesecake. And possibly 2 out of the 358 entree items on the menu. (Okay, I exaggerate, there is like 100. Or maybe 200.) I just don't see how a kitchen can properly execute each dish perfectly if there are 1000s of dishes they need to know. I am highly suspect that the ingredients are not fresh.  But I digress. Calling way ahead of time, coming and picking up the order- this has seemed to work just fine.  Also, after going out for the night, coming to the Cheesecake Factory at the end of the night always seems like a good idea. It usually is.

Eddie H.,"Tulsa, OK",23,101,313,3.0,11/4/2015,"My first visit to a cheesecake factory was a cloudy fall evening.  I ordered The Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. It came with fries.  I nibbled on the bread they brought to the table while I waited.  The dark wheat bread had a soft but chewy texture with caramel notes that left a smoky after taste.  It seemed a shame to relegate it to pre-dinner munching.  it is worth a starring role.  The white bread was far chewier and crunchy with a glutinous texture that spoke of peasant roots and hinted at a missed calling to the status of crouton makings. The atmosphere was upscale but noisy with dim lighting that went for intimate but achieved an open crowded vibe. The burger arrived. I opted for mayo in lieu of the tartar sauce like not so ""special sauce."" The bun was soft but we'll toasted. it was high class enough to hang out in a joint like this but down to earth enough to be a proper hamburger bun. The beef was soft but pallid. Light on beefy flavor The patty left most of the flavor to the bacon. The Bacon itself was charred past the point of crispy and tasted only a moment from being burned. The cheese was delightfully creamy and gave quiet support to the rest of the burger The fries were lightly golden brown and delicious... They were right out of a dictionary definition of American French fries. My overall opinion is tentative worth ordering again if you""'re comming here with friends and want a burger instead of something else.  If I ever come back I will explore the menu for something else. I took home a piece of Strawberry Cheesecake (It didn't seem right not to try the cheesecake at a place called The Cheesecake Factory. The filling was mildly tangy with a modified creamy taste. The crust was slightly soggy with a grainy texture and pleasant molasses undertone to the graham cracker crust.

The original server put in the wrong salad for my friend so we didn't blame Sydney for it. The food was good but nothing spectacular. I ended up sharing the lemoncello cream torte for dessert. The mascarpone was beyond bitter so I asked Sydney if that was how it was supposed to taste and she said yes.

However, when the staff is less than helpful when food is brought to the table frozen in the middle for one member of my party, and the plates are completely cold for myself and two others, an apology and a replacement entrée  is all that is needed. When are our server finally brought the two replacement chicken Bellagio's after waiting an additional hour it was completely drenched in oil. Now being that I waited two hours to eat I went ahead and had a few bites despite the egregious service that I received, only to be made physically sick due to all the oil that in my opinion was given out of spite. I spoke with 2 managers that did not acknowledge the cold food. One person in our party never received their original order, and they received the replacement entrée that was frozen in the middle. No one apologized or an the original entrée that was offered never made it to the table.  There was not any acknowledgement for the lack of food service by our waiter as well.  I will not be visiting this location ever again.

Again, they were ok but nothing I found exceptional.   I found on the bill that soft drinks were $3, lemonade $4 and regular coffee was also $3. Average food and unexceptional desserts, even if a bit overpriced based on ingredient, quality and taste are something I can live with.

As long as the General manager, Rick is piling in people he could care less how your food tastes or how long it takes to get to you.

But don't worry even if the uniform is covered in cat urine, this man will say it's ""cool just come to work"".  I could list a million reasons why not to eat here at this particular restaurant but the biggest of all is the unsanitary practice of cooks in the back, from going to the bathroom, and right back to cooking missing the sink.

April C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",46,51,107,4.0,7/17/2015,"Absolutely superb miso salmon.  I have had a hard time exploring other dishes because of my addiction with this entree.  It's sweet and savory on a bed of rice with asparagus.  The salmon is cooked perfectly with a crispy caramelized outside.  Total love!!!!  I recently tried some other dishes including the combination of shrimp scampi and salmon with lemon sauce.  I usually love scampi but the salmon again was the better half of this dish with an outstanding lemon sauce.  It wasn't too tart, having the right amount of citrus which melded perfect with the creamy sauce.   We also tried the salmon salad.  This is a great salad if you like mustard.  It was nice and fresh and addicting.   For appetizers, I highly recommend the fried calamari.  The breading wasn't too much and it wasn't overlooked or oily like other places.  They nailed it in my opinion.  It comes with a cocktail sauce and an amazing tarter sauce that had a great garlic kick.  Perhaps the best tartar sauce I've ever had.  The asparagus crab dip was so so for me.  It was a bit cheesy and reminded me of a tuna dip.   The cheesecakes here are of course KILLER!!!!  Although a bit pricier than other chains, the Cheesecake Factory has dishes that are fresh with amazing flavor.  I'm never disappointed coming here and again my favorite all time dish here is the miso salmon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=40

At this time the restaurant was very busy but our waiter helped us to the best of his ability and was very polite the entire time.  We got our menu and was shown the specials. Something new we noticed was the availability of the lunch menu on weekends now. This is new for most restaurants we've visited and was a nice option and something we'll take into consideration for next time. Overall we greatly enjoyed our meal, the food was flavorful and the perfect temperature. It's always disappointing to go to a busy restaurant and get cold food, but here it was on point. Another plus to this trip was our table-bread was actually warm! Our cheesecake was delicious and really cured my sweet tooth for the weekend. The only downside to our trip to C.F. was service. It had nothing to do with our waiter or the waitstaff that helped us, but more on the organization of the waitstaff. It seemed for the entire patio of at least a dozen tables, there was only our one server. He would have to carry out orders for three different tables at a time to keep caught up. Me and my wife are pretty patient, so we expected to be there awhile. But it was easy to see that some customers were getting irate with the lack of service. Maybe it was the heat...

It's common practice for her to ask and receive one. The server didn't quite know what that was. He said he would check. He comes back and says they don't have one available. Ok fine. My wife decided to order a turkey sandwich but we were told they are out of turkey. My wife goes to her next option; they are out of that too.

Anisah H.,"Manhattan, NY",20,299,358,1.0,11/17/2015,"They couldn't just take the gnocchi noodles back and apologize, they had to insult my professionally trained palate! First I would just like to say that I have been preparing various types of pasta since  I was 8 years old starting out under my mother and grandmother in the kitchen; with that being said I stand almost 30 years old and I know exactly what al dente pasta is and how it should be achieved depending on which pasta is being prepared. Today around 2:00 pm I stopped in to pick up a dinner portion of Fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken to go, to share for lunch. What I was served was something reminiscent of gnocchi in fettuccine form. This culinary faux pas may happen for a number of reasons, one being the water to noodle ratio is incorrect, (not enough water to noodles) which was most likely the problem here.  I placed the food back in the original container and returned for a refund to be insulted by some person who didn't even tatse the food in order to qualify to have an opinion on the dish. How dare you? Next time, apologize, then offer to make the food properly, and if you are seriously sorry offer a free soft drink or dessert. Never insinuate that a customer doesn't comprehend what a basic dish of anything should be. You take the payments so take the payments and mind your manners, do not tell me that people enjoy eating rubbery chewy doughy pasta, those people and you apparently need to make pasta-mush-gum paste in their own kitchens on your own time  because as a  restaurant you should set the bar higher than that, you should know better, you shouldn't be wasting my time, and your customer service should be basic if not better.

We waited 10 minutes to get our drinks. He also brought us out some bread and we finished it before he could even come back and take our order. The Sunday brunch sounded wonderful. I ordered "" fried chicken and waffles Benedict "". My hubby ordered a burger. We have a 17 month old daughter so she would just share with us. We waited and waited for our food to come out. Our waiter never offered more bread. A table seated after us got their food first. Finally our food arrived. It looked great. Big portions. Unfortunately I wasn't a fan of my food. I managed to get down half a waffle and that was it. Our waiter never came by to see how we were doing or how the food was tasting. When he did come by he cleared our plates and asked if we'd like dessert. I did. He brought us by the menu again to choose what we'd like. It took him a very long time to return to get out order. We had been waiting a long time so I just ordered a slice of cheesecake to go. All in all we were there for 2 hours and the service was slow and inattentive. Huge disappointment. Wish we hadn't wasted our family day on this restaurant. We even drove an hour out of our way to eat there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=60

The manager apologized and took our drink orders. Then they forgot again! We finally saw the manager took our order for starters and dinner. The dinner came 35 min after and the starters came 10 min after our dinner!  We did complain and they did offer one of the appetizers for free but regardless the service in this restaurant really needs to improve.  Food is up the CheeseCake Factory.

Axel was our server and seemed to care less, although he was super attentive to the table of three right next to us. When our food finally did come it was only three plates of the five. We waited six minutes for another plate then the last plate showed up four minutes later. The kicker is that it was the kids meal that arrived last. At the very least get the child's meal out first...how hard is it for chicken strips and fries?!  There was a table of seven near us and amazingly they managed to get all of their food at the same time.

Mike M.,"Portland, OR",155,6,,4.0,2/27/2016,"I don't normally review chain restaurants, but the service at this location is out of this world. My friend and I were looking for a restaurant that served late and we found The Cheesecake Factory as we walked out of the mall. We walked in and were seated immediately. Our server, Laura M, was one of the best servers I've ever had. She was attentive, patient, and accommodating, especially when she learned about my dietary restrictions. She made us feel right at home, so much so that I'd recommend asking for her by name to anyone going to this particular location.  I did have one complaint, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the service. The tile floor was hazardously slick throughout the restaurant. I was concerned about face-planting on the way to our table and every time I left my seat. It's like there was grease smeared all over the floor. Honestly, even if this was never remedied, it wouldn't scare us away. People like Laura will always bring in repeat customers. She's spectacular and I'll be back even if it means I have to crawl to my table.

Alan H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",63,313,410,1.0,2/22/2015,"Ok, The Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations and will not allow anyone to add their party to the wait list unless the entire party is present. We walked in at 1215 with a party of 9, 4 adults and 5 children. We were told the wait would be 30 minutes max. At 40 minutes manager approaches me and tells me party in our seats are eating dessert and it should be another 10 to 15 minutes. 20 minutes later, after we see a party of 9 seated that arrived well after us, I approach the manager and ask him how much longer as we have been waiting over an hour at this point.  He looks at us with a blank stare on his face and although he did not admit the fact he had skipped over us (either by mistake or on purpose) I realize he had as he again walks through the entire restaurant looking for a differant place to seat us. By this time my wife's furious and the children are starting to melt down being bored and hungry. The manager strings us along another fifteen minutes making our entire wait over 80 minutes!! We have never had a bad meal here, service has always been spot on. Joe, waiter, took great care of us, and although still seething with anger I took care of him as well via tip. Meals, dessert, two drinks came to $100. I won't be back. Any restaurant that does not take reservations, or call ahead, or allow one person to sign up party without entire party being present, AND THEN EVEN SCREW UP A WAIT LIST, does not get my return business. We were treated like badly behaving livestock waiting in the shoot to be castrated, one after the other, then sent on our way. I am so very sorry, yes i goofed that up bad.  Is there anything i can do to make it up to you....anything, just say the word! Cheesecake Factory but this pain won't go away this time.

Theresa D.,"Seattle, WA",279,281,129,5.0,6/18/2015,"Heads up, this place is near the mall so you may experience less than desirable waits and service due to the employees overwhelmed with the masses awaiting their deliciousness. Yes this place is great to chow down then walk off the calories or shop then relax with their encyclopedia of a menu. Some of my favorite appetizers are the Avacado rolls, white hummus, bang bang shrimp. Their pasta Da Vinci is delicious. And I've tried most of their cheesecakes so you're gonna have to go with what flavors speak to you. If you're a wino,  try their red sangria. I'm pretty sure I drink pitchers of that. So delicious. Don't be intimidated by the options as some people are. It's broken up so just find what flavors you're in the mood for and I'm sure your waiter can steer you into a direction that you'll enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=80
Esther L.,"Las Vegas, NV",113,209,68,4.0,5/24/2014,My visit here today was OK for a pretty established place as the cheesecake factory. I went this afternoon at 4 for an early dinner with my fiance and we were surprised at the lack of parking spot and how busy it was at this time.  The reason? I believe it was because of their great lunch special which lasts till 5 pm!! I got the spicy Chipotle chicken. They say lunch portion but I couldn't even eat half of it. I saw a sign in the front door and it said there is happy hour from Monday to Friday from 4-6pm on select appetizer being 5$. Considering their appetizers are usually 10 dollars this is a great deal to go with friends for an early dinner and try their wonderful small dishes.  One thing I always am sad about is that I eat so much I never have room for dessert!! I have tried the majority of their cheesecake but my favorite is the Hershey chocolate one! !! It's rich enough to satisfy your chocolate craving without being too overwhelming!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=80

My wife and I were seated quickly on the patio amid a Friday night throng of other waiting customers waiting for seating. I overheard the host mention a 20 minute wait time for indoor tables.The server was wonderful and very attentive. The down side for me was the food. I ordered the Charbroiled Choulotte Steak. A cut of sirloin that was triangular on its cut and  roughly five inches long.I asked for medium-well and received a rare-medium serving. The server graciously returned it for a bit more cook time.Although the steak had good flavor, it was very tough to chew from being a bit overcooked on its return. My side of mashed potatoes were fair....nothing exciting. A little pricey for food that I would consider mediocre.

Joe C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",99,619,139,3.0,8/26/2013,"So look, Cheesecake Factory is certainly not going to be confused with fine dining any time soon. Here's one thing I'll throw out about them: Most chains figure they're going to do one thing well, and then they'll add a few throwaway dishes to cover the tastes of the folks who aren't interested in whatever they're most ""proud"" of. This is how you wind up with people like my [redacted], who will think nothing of ordering a glass of Chardonnay at a run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. Cheesecake Factory, on the other hand, has attempted to create mass-market, easily replicable and average-quality food that will appeal to the tastes of ANYONE who walks in the door. Any four random pages of their menu book would be more than enough for your average chain, and they have way, way more than four pages. I've had the food more than I wish, and while it isn't great, it is usually at least average and keeps that standard across the ridiculous variety of stuff they're churning out. And I also give them bonus points for having the word ""factory"" in their name. It's not like they're hiding what they're up to, are they? You need great service to get to ""above average"" for this kind of place, and I've never had that at this location. But there are chains out there doing way less ambitious work, and not doing it as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=80

Rosie G.,"El Reno, OK",0,16,,1.0,1/16/2016,"We visited this restaurant on a Saturday at noon with my husband and two small children. The wait was at 15-20 minutes and we got seated 5 minutes into the wait so was a relief. Here comes the frustrating part. The hostess sat us down and I asked where my highchair was and she said she would bring it right out. I don't like to sit down with my 13 month old unless he is in his highchair otherwise once the highchair arrives he will only want to be in my arms. Something any toddler mom can understand. I am standing there for about 5 minutes while the hostess continues to sit people and no server in sight. I finally walk up to the hostess and she said ""sorry we are out"". While she is saying the word ""out"" she is walking away from me not allowing me to ask how long my wait would be. I go sit down. Finally 10 minutes later our server arrives to take the drink order. Long story short I ate my entire meal with one hand while holding my toddler in the other. Incredibly frustrating having to do that while paying $17 per plate and $7 for a kids meal. I did ask the server and even the manager 2-3 times if there was one available during our meal and the answer was no every time. I am never visiting this place again.

You can usually count on great service, great meals, great desert... and a fairly large bill. I don't mind that bill thing if all the other characteristics are in place, but Saturday night was a complete fail on their part. We started out with one server and after our order was placed, we had someone new. Our drinks were never refilled and we rarely saw our server. My daughter ordered the BBQ burger with the sauce on the side (pretty difficult huh). It came out fully drenched in BBQ ranch sauce. My daughter and I received our meals but our server said he would be right out with my wife's meal (chicken madeira). So we waited....and waited...and waited until a manager walked up and said her meal was served to the wrong table. He apologized and refilled our drinks because our waiter was no where to be seen. Several minutes later we were getting antsy because we were going to be late for our movie. Several more minutes pass and here comes the manager with her food. He offered to buy us a piece of cheesecake but we explained we were running late for our movie. He then offered to discount (not delete) the cost of her meal. It seemed like his biggest concern was getting off without giving a freebie. My wife said we would take the discount. We hurried through our meal to get to the movie. Our waiter then appeared briefly, just long enough to drop off the fully priced meal. Apparently the manager WAS really concerned about his margin. He never got that ""partial discount"" applied to our meal. I think he knew we were, at that point, in too big of a hurry to wait for a corrected check. For your attention to your margin, Mr. Manager, you purchased this review and a former customer. I hope it was worth it.

The lunch portions are still pretty large and will fill you up, though I'm not sure if it's the food or complimentary bread that fills me up more.

Every dessert I've ever had from here has been consistently, sinfully delicious. They have a huge variety of cheesecakes to choose from and the display is enough to make my mouth water. I've tried several different kinds, but my favorite is the simple classic cheesecake with strawberries and whip cream. I know they get all of their desserts shipped in. Nothing is made in-house. This is usually a big food turn-off for me, but the deliciousness of the cheesecakes wins me over. I love it! Even though you're looking at around $7 a slice, I think it's totally worth it. I can't say the same about the non-bakery items. Ok, so I will say the complimentary sourdough and dark honey-wheat bread they serve is great. I was really hungry when we got there and happy to find out I didn't have to wait for our food to get a little nibble in. However, after the bread, my meal went way downhill. I ordered scrambled eggs with potatoes and a bagel with cream cheese. The eggs looked and tasted like edible plastic and the potatoes were over-processed and bland-tasting. My favorite thing was the bagel and cream cheese, but even the bagel was burnt a little bit. I really haven't had a good food experience any time I've visited this restaurant and I have come to discover that a ridiculously long menu usually equals blah food as is the case here. Also, although our waitress was sweet and somewhat attentive, I think the servers might be overworked here. Everyone seemed frantic and frazzled. And why do they make them all wear white everything?!? Not a good look for frazzled wait staff in my opinion. I guess the moral of this story is, BREAK THE CHAINS unless you are satisfied with bland food. But do go in and pick up a cheesecake if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed with that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=100
Sharon M.,"Mesa, AZ",94,242,93,3.0,3/10/2012,"I like Cheesecake Factory every now and again. This CF is exactly like any other CF I've ever been to. Just like the one in SLC and just like the 2 I ate at in AZ before moving here. There is nothing unique about any particular CF, it's a chain restaurant but one that I tend to enjoy for my birthday.  We had a pretty good experience as far as food goes. In fact service and food were all fantastic until my bff said ""It's her birthday"" and not for the obvious ""they're gonna sing and embarass me"" reason. It literally took 20 minutes to get my cheesecake with ""happy birthday to you"" written in chocolate on the plate's rim.  Other than that: I requested pasta with my samlon instead of mashed potatoes. While the request was granted without any fuss the noodles were undercooked and stuck together. The sweet corn tamale cakes though, were so so good!  I'm not a big fan of corporate restaurants.

Our hostess sat my date and I at a tiny, two-person table squeezed in between two full tables. One of the tables was full of very loud teenage girls obsessed with selfies.  Anyways, back to the food. I asked for a water with lemon, pretty basic, but never got a lemon all night even after asking the waiter multiple times. I ordered the shrimp BLT and a side salad. The salad was a good mix of greens with a very yummy, chunky blue cheese dressing. The sandwich was massive! It had thick strips of crispy bacon and large slices of tomato, although the tomato had not fully ripened yet (yay green tomatoes!). There was very little shrimp which was disappointing because let's face it, shrimp is the whole reason for living! Next up, the cheese cake!!! I ordered red velvet cheese cake and my date had the cookie dough. They were both pretty epic. The cookie dough cake has actual cookie dough in the middle! Wow. The red velvet is worth the $10 and it's so huge that I had cheese cake for the next three nights.  All in all, I would recommended this place to someone during a weekday. Nice atmosphere (unless you get placed next to high school girls), friendly staff, and yummy food.

Do you want to be ""that"" guy or girl?   The service was good even though we went during the Sunday brunch rush.  The one thing I would suggest is to ask to keep one menu as that table to browse the cheesecake flavors.  My favorites are the Key Lime, Lemon Raspberry and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle.  Don't plan anything too ambitious for about 4 hours after a trip to the Cheesecake Factory- usually a nap while watching TV will help you through the food fog.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-oklahoma-city?start=120
