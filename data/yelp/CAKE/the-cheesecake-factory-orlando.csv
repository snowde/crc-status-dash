Christian J.,"Orlando, FL",48,55,70,3.0,2/25/2017,"So I went to Cheesecake Factory for me and my boyfriend's anniversary. The reason I did not give Cheesecake 4 or 5 stars is because I felt like the service was not GREAT. I'll start with the negatives.  The server I had that night really did not seem too invested in us, and it made me wonder if it was because we are both young, maybe she felt like we might not tip her as well? I'm not sure. But she seemed more invested in the tables around us. We sat with dirty plates for at least 10 minutes, as she helped tables around us. And when she brought the final receipt she said HERE YOU GO, and smiled and left. I'm thinking when you bring the check you should be very kind since they are about to tip you. Say THANK YOU FOR DINING WITH US TONIGHT, HAVE A GREAT NIGHT. Another thing that bothered me that as I walked out I walked past about 7 employees, 3 which were at the hostess desk, and NO ONE said have a good night. So even though the food was perfect, i wondered ARE OTHER LOCATIONS FRIENDLIER? Now to the positives! I got the chicken Madeira again, and it's great because it's pretty light it very satisfying and flavorful. My boyfriend got the same thing he got the first time he went, which I can't remember the name of the plate, but it hadc782123d-68e1-470d-8493-042632e23bee chicken and spaghetti I tomato sauce, and he specifically wanted to come to Cheesecake Factory to have this same plate again. We had drinks as well, and both my peach frozen drink and his pina colada were very tasted. We were so full that we had ZERO room for dessert. That's one great thing about this restaurant, is that you get your money's worth. Again, the food was wonderful, the service was just not anything to compliment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=40
Carol C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,5,3.0,12/26/2017,"I called ahead of time asking if they were busy and I was told a 20-30 minute wait for a party of 5. Once I got there about 15 minutes later the wait was up to 45 minutes for 5. The table which we sat at had cheesecake all over the place. We asked for someone to clean it and our waitress handed us napkins. My utensil were dirty from the cheesecake. The small windows surrounding our table were covered with cheesecake, most likely a child did it, but it would be descent of them to clean it up. Bread was brought out but never replaced. Our server was good at refilling water though and the food came out at a good time, however everything came out at different times. I really enjoyed my Skinnylicious Shrimp Tacos, Im really glad they make a skinny menu since everything else is over 1,000 calories. I had the Tiramisu Cheesecake and it was very good. All together, waitress was good but meals should come out at the same time and cleaning should be more of a priority.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=40

It is worth the wait to try other local places like Keke's, first watch, hash house and slate  Service was really slow and the kitchen staff put 0 effort into preparing the meals...meals came out at various times so half the party was almost done eating by the time others got their food.

Paul G.,"Orlando, FL",138,650,1087,3.0,12/21/2016,"WARNING: If you make a reservation, you have a 10-minute window. You WILL lose your reservation if you you go beyond that, and will have to wait for a seat. No questions asked. We came here for our team's Christmas lunch. Needless to say we got back to the office later than expected. That said, the food and service were really good. I had the crab bites, samosas, and dynamite shrimp. All were very good, and I'd get any one of them again. I am extremely bummed that they no longer have the shrimp BLT. That used to be my go-to entree. Doubt I'll be rushing back here again.

Puro S.,"Dallas, TX",3,105,165,2.0,2/21/2017,"Food: 5/10 Service: 7/10 Value: 6/10 Ambience: 7/10 TL;DR - Okay appetizer, bad entree, terribad dessert. Be prepared to pass out 12 hours if you order the artichoke dip (YMMV). Finally caved in per my girlfriend's request. The menu didn't look that intimidating in person to my surprised. We ordered thai salad (good but too much work/10), crab/artichoke dip (9/10), salmon/steak combo (6/10), and strawberry shortcake (2/10). Service was fine, seating was a bit cramped but not too bad. I probably should have tried a slice of cheesecake, but the price is a bit steep. We went home and passed out for 12 hours and concluded that the artichoke dip was the culprit.

Alex Z.,"Orlando, FL",103,53,22,5.0,9/27/2017,"Boom, 5 Stars - they hit on all cylinders!  If you've read my reviews, you know I don't just give out 5 stars.  I think that great food and service is 4 stars and require that something extra for 5.  But my last trip here, the food was great, but the reason for the 5th star was 100% because of the best service I've had in a long time from our waiter Yassine!  TCF has a 20 page menu, so they have whatever your stomach is craving.  The portions are enough for two meals, so while the choices may be a couple more dollars than your used to, you have to remember that you also are getting two meals with each meal you order.  One for now, one for later.  I had the truffle fried chicken and it came with two gigantic chicken breasts and what seemed like a pound of mashed potatoes.  It was hot and delicious, but I enjoyed it just as much the next day when it was cold and straight out of my fridge (haha).  Yassine anticipated all our needs and ones we didn't even know we had.  He was on top of his game with extra bread, wet wipes for the baby, banana slices for the toddler, providing small extras we didn't ask for, prompt, and just the right amount of interaction.  There is a wait at this location usually and it is warranted.  Arrive early or call ahead to avoid it!  Oh yeah, they have cheesecake too :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=40
Kim C.,"Bigfork, MT",25,168,198,3.0,4/12/2017,I love this place. They are always consistent. I love the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. There's plenty for lunch the next day. With loads of meat and shrimp. I ask for it extra spicy. It has a sweet hot flavor. The rice is delicious too it's a nutty brown rice.

Fred P.,"Fort Wayne, IN",49,227,17,4.0,3/6/2016,"Stopped here for lunch one day while melting the credit card inside the Mall of Millenia.  We didn't have to wait long, which was nice.  The decor of the restaurant was amazing.  The menu selection was very diverse and enticing.   I had the bacon bacon burger and was not disappointed.  The French fries were also very crisp and fresh.  What really stood out was the side of ranch dressing my wife ordered.  It was very tasty so I ordered my own.   For dessert we split a slice of red velvet cheesecake.  Warning - the slices are huge.  It was exquisite and we weren't able to finish it.  Our server was very nice and efficient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=40

To make matters worse, our apps took forever and were mediocre at best. Our food took forever and they served my youngest like 20 minutes after everyone else got their food. A kids meal! Our server then tried to charge me $3.95 for the drink that came with his kids meal. I pointed it out to her and she said,""I'll see if they will take it off.""  Wrong answer. My 8 year old ordered it. It was in front of him, I had my own drink. Terrible service. Never again.

Maridyth N.,"Orlando, FL",93,140,514,4.0,1/6/2018,"We went here today with some friends for a late lunch, and arrived around 2pm. It was so busy that we had to wait an hour for a table (we were told this when we put our names in and opted to wait).  The waiting area in the restaurant can get a little tight, especially today with there being cooler than normal temps outside. An hour passed and we were notified that our table was ready. We went to the hostess stand and were directed to stand over in another area and wait to be called. I don't understand why Cheesecake Factory does this as standing room is at a premium at the front of the restaurant. After about 5 minutes of additional waiting, we were led to our table.  Our server was very friendly and welcoming. She took our drink orders then gave us time to look over the expansive menu. I ended up ordering the Americana Cheeseburger and a side of fries. This burger is topped with American and Cheddar cheese, potato crisps, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles and secret sauce. It was a very tasty burger! I ordered a slice of Hershey's Chocolate Bar cheesecake to go. This is Hershey's cheesecake between chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate chips. This is a rich, decadent slice of heaven...if you're a chocolate fan, you need this cake! Overall this is a good restaurant. The parking lot is large (it's in a mall), but can be a challenge; however there is valet parking if you want to skip the lot (and it's right in front of the restaurant!). The staff are friendly, and the food is good. It can be pricey, but the portion sizes are huge.  Check it out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando
Ritu D.,"Mississauga, Canada",23,107,245,4.0,1/1/2018,"We came on a cold rainy New Year's Day...just like everyone else in Orlando, it seems. We waited 2 hours for a table after being told it would be an 80 minute wait. We knew they didn't take reservations and this place is my older son's vacation meal destination....so we were prepared to wait. Luckily the mall was open so we were able to occupy our time. Once seated, the server was quite helpful in making food choices. I had the vegan Cobb salad which was huge, delicious and satisfying. Older son ordered a chicken sandwich and hubby and younger son ordered burgers....the mushroom and Mac and cheese burgers. None of them could finish their meals. They had shrimp tempura and bread to start. All 3 ordered cheesecake...salted caramel, marshmallow s'mores and banana cream. They took the cheesecakes back to eat later.

I should have sent it back but I did not have the time.  Do Not Order the Pit Beef..! Yikes... Be careful if it is busy which it often is. The hostess stand can be disorganized.

Louise S.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",343,557,2626,4.0,1/13/2018,"Cheesecake, Cheesecake, and more Cheesecake. Yes please. If you don't want to wait, arrive when they open. It's the only time there is not wait. I went here with my daughter after a day in the mall. We arrived right   before I think the lunch crowd started. It was roughly noon time. We waited about ten minutes before our beeper went off. By the time we went to our table, people were being told 35-40 minutes so we just made it. It is a beautifully decorated place but they seem to pack people in like sardines. No room what so ever from you are the next table. We were greeted by our waitress almost as soon as we sat down. The menu is beyond HUGE! Way to many items to prepare the way they should in my mind. We both went with the mushroom burger the had smoked gouda cheese on  it. The gouda cheese gave it a great taste. I have to say it made the burger. And it was cooked perfectly. As we were waiting we were treated to some good fresh bread. Our waitress as nice as she was, was spread entirely to thin with tables. We never got refills on our drinks which was only water until we got our check. Definitely something any waitress or waiter needs to pay attention to is empty glasses. We split the chocolate cake - coconut cheesecake the was beyond amazing. The other not good situation here is that the restrooms do not have enough stales in them. The ladies only have 3 stales and usually the line is out the door. I know we will be back even it's only for the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando

The host told my cousin that there was a 50min wait. However, my cousin is currently takin chemo and has to eat before 7pm (reason why we got here so early for dinner!). My family told the host and asked if it was possible to get a table a bit faster .. either outside or inside because we knew our dinner would be fast.  The manager came over and gave us menus. He told us to look over the dishes so when we were seated we could order right away. We got a table in 15mins and ordered right away!!  The food was good and of course, the cheesecake .. absolutely delish. The manager came by several times to check up on us. It really was a great experience.

John M.,"Orlando, FL",188,36,85,4.0,11/27/2017,"Since my SO and I live about 2 minutes down the street, we probably come here about twice a month. We try and come a bit early since this restaurant is at the mall and can be VERY busy later at night. If you come when they're busy it can be about a 45 - 1 hour wait. I always order the same thing, ""Spicy Cashew Chicken"" because I love it. She changes between a few different items. We always start with ""brown bread"" with butter and their Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing. This combination is nothing short of magical when you have fresh warm bread. If you don't want to pay for an app then this will fill you up just as much. On to the main event. The Spicy Cashew Chicken is most of the time prepared correctly, only a few rare times is it a little off. I only get the white rice, so can't say how the brown rice is. The sauce is amazing mixed the slightly fried chicken and the cashews. To me there's absolutely no spice, but it's too spicy for my SO. Another great thing is that it's large enough to have the next day! We always love coming to Cheesecake Factory for their good food. The atmosphere can be a bit loud and chaotic as this place is always busy. The cheesecakes are good too, just never enough room at the end to order them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando
Ivan H.,"Miami, FL",91,244,1989,3.0,9/17/2017,"I'm a fan of Cheesecake and often go when we're undecided as a group. We recently went for a birthday and our group of 9 was seated within minutes.  This location looks exactly like their Dadeland Mall location in Miami.  I saw the fish and chips dish from their Aventura location and it looked really nice: large pieces of fish, not these scrawny pieces as I was served. Ordered green beans as I didn't want more fried foods but they came half way into my meals and so unexciting. Ok, green beans aren't exciting but these tasted so bad, undercooked frozen green beans.  Best part of the meal was the pumpkin cheesecake that was marvelous, an extra star for this, and another star for good service.  Other than that...my evening was uneventful.

As in the few times I've been here there has always been a wait, but it is worth it. After being seated we were greeted by our waiter who took our drink an appetizer order. Upon returning with the drinks he brought out some of that amazing bread they serve here. We chose to start with our favorite app the Avocado Egg-rolls. These delectable treats are amazing the crispy ness and flavors are sure to surprise.  I chose the Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" it comes complete with: Breaded Spiced Chicken Pieces fried crisp and served with Mashed Potatoes, and Corn Succotash. First let me say that there is nothing little about what you get. The chicken comes out piled high. The only thing I could wish for is a bigger stomach or their recipe.

Assuming a lot of the customers to be tourists though. Wait was about 45 minutes for a table of two! That's crazy. Anyways, workers here always seem very flustered because it is always so busy.

Angela R.,"FL, FL",63,129,304,2.0,8/28/2017,"I wish I could leave more stars. I love the Cheesecake Factory and have been going to other locations in FL and loved them all.. and then I came here.  Welcoming staff was nice, my fiancée and I had to wait a couple minutes to be seated and we were put in a pretty dark corner where the server had to ask a woman to move her purse, which seemed to make her very angry. Also, are non-service dogs allowed here? She had a small dog on the booth the entire time without a service vest? If I was allowed that I would've brought my dog too.... Our server came to us very quickly and gave us bread and butter immediately. He gave a time to look over the menu. We started with the loaded tot appetizer. I ordered the pineapple chicken and shrimp and my fiancée ordered the chicken and biscuits.  Our tots had a cream cheese plastic wrap inside one. The first one we tried. My fiancée took a big bite and pulled it out of his mouth!! I'm VERY glad we took that bite before any of the other ones.. hopefully the other ones they've been serving don't have them too unknowingly.... we brought this to the attention of our server and he told us it happened accidentally because the tots are all individually wrapped in plastic and they have to unwrap them each by hand .. but the plastic was INSIDE the tot.  Aside from that severe disappointment.. the entrees were ... okay. We waited what seemed like a very extensive time for the entrees to come out. My fiancées chicken and biscuits was fine. He asked for no mushrooms and they gladly did it for him. Only downside was the biscuits were cold! Waited near a half hour for cold biscuits.. :( I asked for my pineapple chicken and shrimp to have no cilantro ... and it definitely had cilantro still in it. And I can't stand the flavor of it. Aside from the bites with cilantro ... the entree itself was pretty satisfying.  Overall I was disappointed with my visit. It was an anniversary date for a year of being engaged and well.. I wish we went somewhere else. Unsure about how fresh everything is here (what's shipped and what's not, considering what the server told us about the plastic) but if they make them by hand..

We came here and they directed us to the takeout line. I don't understand why because we ordered for pickup. It was a little frustrating considering we had to be back at work fast. It took around 25-30 mins and we waited in line. It also felt like no AC was on and there was too many people. Finally a woman called our name and we got pass a few people and they rang us up for our phone order. The woman who rang us up was incredibly sweet and she made the experience better.

They food was okay - standard for a chain restaurant. However, the hazelnut cheesecake that we had was delicious.  The bummer was the service. My wife and I had water, while our friends had an Arnold Palmer and a sweet tea. While I admit we were there for a while, not once throughout our main course or dessert did our server refill or even offer to refill our beverages - all the cups were empty.

The service:  EXCELLENT!!!! Our server knew that menu inside and out, was patient, and was on top of everything, as were the foodrunners and support staff.  Good job. The food: I knew coming in that every dish is supposed to be like 5,000 calories. So, I went head first and ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.  It was actually very good with a huge quantity. It might have been a bit overpriced, but it's expected at a tourist restaurant.  I tried others' appetizers that included guacamole, calamari, and an avocado egg roll.  All were very tasty.  Too full to eat anything else, I took two orders of cheesecake home. I haven't tried them yet, but I was surprised how small they were.   The value:  It's all a bit over-priced for what it is, but again it seems to cater to tourists and birthday parties, so I can't knock it for that.   Again, 3.5 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando

Gretchen M.,"Kissimmee, FL",76,64,27,4.0,11/1/2017,So after going a Friday night... at what I consider way too late to have dinner time... I must say I was surprised at how packed it was. Good thing the wait was not long at all.  The server was nice and patient since it was my first time and I did not know what to order.  I tried the crab bites and it was delicious.  I just hope they were bigger in size without being so big in price.  Also had a chicken quesadilla but that wasn't anything that blew me away.   Tried the chips and guac plus the pot stickers as well. I've had better pot stickers but they were ok. No room for dessert though. One downside is how extensive is the menu. No wonder why the kitchen was going crazy at such busy time.

Stacy F.,"Orlando, FL",1320,1460,7211,3.0,2/3/2017,"Obviously cheesecake is king here and shouldn't be missed if possible. The wait times and inconsistent staff here bring this specific location down a couple notches on the rankings.  There is forever a line at this one. That being said you'd think they'd have better waiting options. Plenty of places now offer a text when your table is ready instead of hanging in the lobby area. This place doesn't. To bolster that time suck they also have extremely limited seating to wait on.  The menu is the standard ""sweet jesus how can they possibly have so many options come from one kitchen??"" My go to is the parmesan chicken with mashed potatoes. I avoid looking at the black hole that is the menu here.  Cheesecake is an obvious win. The tuxedo is my personal fave and the black and white a close runner up.  Staff is inconsistent. We've had awesome waiters who didn't even let you sip out of your water without standing by to refill it and waiters who have gone amiss and you feel you should send a search party and file a missing persons report.  Overall: B- Be ready to wait. Obviously order cheesecake. Have search parties on speed dial.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando
Douglas D.,"Orlando, FL",183,81,326,5.0,8/2/2017,"Met up for a date night at Cheesecake Factory at the mall. This location always seems to be somewhat crazy since it is at the mall and it feels like there are people everywhere. We were seated fairly quickly and had our waiter Wagner check up on us when we sat down. He was very pleasant and explained the specials. The reason I love cheesecake is because they have so many different options on their menu and they give you generous portions. They have different types of food ranging from pasta, to Asian, to fried chicken, to small plates, and appetizers.  My favorite plate is the cashew chicken they offer. It is a very generous portion and has the perfect amount of spice. It comes with white rice and the sauce is sweet and spicy. Always my go to and ordered it tonight as well. We also ordered the avocado egg rolls and I'm a HUGE fan of the green sauce that comes with it. Never a let down. My gf ordered the pasta and she seems to always love it.  You can't leave without having a piece of cheesecake so I ordered the hazelnut crunch, which is fairly new, and my gf ordered ""old faithful"" which is the oreo cheesecake. The cheesecake is to die for and always a must have for me. Best dessert you can have after a delicious meal.

Yerim P.,"Orlando, FL",8,23,11,4.0,9/23/2017,It's been years since I've visited Cheesecake Factory. My fiancée and I stumbled into Cheesecake Factory by Millenia because our original plans at a different restaurant didn't pan out.  First of all there was a 40 minute wait when we got there on a Saturday night. Cant say we were surprised- it was a Saturday night and when we called earlier they informed us they do not take reservations during the weekend. Totally understandable the wait and line were insane!!  When it was finally our turn though -- the food was outstanding! We ordered sweet corn tamale because of a recommendation from a friend. I didn't know what to expect and I'm not a huge fan of tamales myself but man oh man - it blew my mind! The flavors mesh so well together and the sauce is sooo good. TBH this could be an entree all on its own if you want it costs around $10-11?  Next we got our entree - we both ordered from the specialty menu of the night. I got the pasta napolenta and he got the carne asada medallion. Both were really good. My pasta consisted of 3 different meats and the sauce was so flavorful. The portion wasn't as big as their other plates but it was more than enough for me! I even took some home.  We finished our night off with tiramisu Cheesecake - absolutely life changing. It was. AMAZING!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=20
Melinda P.,"Orlando, FL",44,122,337,2.0,3/15/2017,A group of us came to Cheesecake Factory tonight for a friend's birthday. It was not what I would consider a positive experience.  They don't take reservations in the evening so our party requested a table at around 7 and were given an hour and a half wait. The buzzer went off in about that time and then we were told to stand in an awkward spot near the hostess station which is right in the way of people trying to run food. After standing there for about 5 minutes we were seated.  Our server was not particularly friendly or attentive. It took a long time to get all of our orders in. One order had a mistake in the side dishes and it took about 10 minutes for the correct side to come out. We ended up there until 10:00 by the time our checks were delivered.  On the positive side the food is quite good there. We shared some avocado egg rolls and loaded baked potato tots which were delicious. My order of chicken Bellagio was really good even though I took most of it to go. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well. Unfortunately the extremely long wait times and lukewarm service do not make up for this fact.  On the bright side I was quite amused that the pillars inside look like the eye of Sauron haha.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=20

Adrie D.,"Orlando, FL",58,135,334,1.0,7/6/2017,"I have to update my review because I couldn't even stay in here tonight.  We love the new items added on the menu, but from the time we got here the hostess with pink glasses didn't even great us, she was too busy chatting and then walked off leaving the host stand unattended without a simple ""Hello"" or ""Will be right with you"". They called us among other 2-top parties and of course they put our little paper with our info all the way to the end, while they keep on stacking other papers ahead of us making it impossible to get called to be seated. Finally our name was the only one left BUT of course, we get the worst possible table (next to the server station by the restrooms) which my husband barely fits in because he's 6'4 At this point we approached the hostess again and complained but what does she cares she's been laughing with other hostesses knowing you have people waiting on you. At that point we just walked out and took our business somewhere else... We're actually at BJ's now. Shame on management because you can tell the experience from my last review changed 180°.  My recommendation: you know you're  a busy location, train your staff (mostly the face of the restaurant) to be communicative and to prioritize their actions (e.g. leave the gossip for later and use that same energy to have a little courtesy towards your paying customers). Also learn to read your customers, if you're facing a very tall person don't put it down at the smallest table you've got knowing the knees will be rubbing against the table. How disappointing...

Cecille R.,"Apopka, FL",537,960,3425,4.0,3/10/2017,"I kind of avoid The Cheesecake Factory like the plague. Especially this location. It's always waaaaaay too crowded and it's tourist central.  I hadn't been here in years so when a friend wanted to have her birthday dinner here, I was happy to oblige.  While the crowded(and claustrophobic) lobby situation is a hot mess , CF exceeded my expectations with their food and service by the awesome Symone! First up, just note that this place doesn't take reservations for after 5pm. So expect a wait during prime dining times. Since we had a large party I made a point to place our name on the list about 1/2 hr prior to when we wanted to dine. Also, you'll have to kind of push your way up to the hostess booth or you'll be standing there waiting forever.  We had a few CF newbies and everyone seemed to be pleasantly surprised by their experience. Symone took wonderful care of us- she was fun, personable and on top of things. The menu is definitely overwhelming so I recommend browsing prior to dining especially if you've never been. There are soooo many choices and they even have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu for those watching their food intake as well as many meatless options scattered throughout the menu.  Aside from the complimentary bread, we ordered a bunch of apps to share amongst the table. The avocado egg rolls were delicious and a standout in my eyes. I ordered the guac and chips to share. Don't underestimate this- it was a substantial portion, fresh and you can pick your heat level! My friend accidentally bit into the pepper that it came with and confirmed the heat level for us! lol     Unfortunately, I ate too much guac b/c by the time my entrée came out, I was a little stuffed. My fish and chips looked great and it also comes with cole slaw. The fish was perfectly battered and a golden color. Tartar sauce is also provided for dipping but the fish was also great on its own.   A few of my friends ordered the sliders and those seemed to be a hit. And apparently you HAVE to get a side of ranch sauce for dipping. It was the star condiment of the night! Anyways a visit here can't go without a slice of cheesecake. We each ordered a slice (or 2) to go and also snuck in a surprise bday singalong for the birthday girl!  While this is not a quick dining experience, it was an enjoyable one!

Their veggie burger is made with brown rice, red peppers, onions, and some other ingredients that I've never experienced before in a veggie burger. It was different, filling, and so, so good. I highly recommend you give it a try. That night hubby and I decided on sitting outside, under the palm trees that light the walk-way at this location. It was a beautiful, quiet, night right after I held my Goddess Gathering. I wanted to be alone, with my husband and enjoy his company with some good food. I accomplished that and I'll forever rave about having the best veggie burger to this date. My husband had the salmon and kale salad which was very good as well.  Even though it was a Monday night they were still very busy. This location is attached to one of the busiest, popular malls in Orlando and that night the restaurant was packed.

The restaurant was easy for them to find, plenty of mall parking, and tons of menu choices to satisfy a wide range of people. The service was excellent, the food was well cooked, and the place was clean.  Surprisingly for a rather busy Christmas week day the food was prepared and served fairly quickly, and we had between us a range of different meals from soup and salads, burgers and salmon. Everyone's meal looked highly appetizing. We were there for lunch, and my friend got the Soup and Sandwich. Now, that looked like a hearty meal that I may need to try next time. I had the Caesar's salad w/chicken, which was good. My wife was full, so she gave me half her mushroom burger and some fries. I really didn't need it, my salad was plenty, but what the heck it was Christmas week! Good burger. Sorry, we didn't stay for desert, but I going to guess their Cheese Cake is good. Next time, maybe. I would say the restaurant is equal or better than most of the casual dining places I've eaten at such as Applebees, Cheddars, Claim Jumpers, Denny's, Perkins, etc. I would diffidently eat here again if I was in mode for a simple but well cooked meal.

Mike A.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",3,15,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Have visited this location many times but have put off somewhat after today's visit. Initially told 40 mins for a table for 2 which was fine and we were prepared to wait. When called for our table we were herded into a ""holding area"" in a walkway with about 6 other groups who all waited, including us an initial  10 mins to be seated. Waitress was very friendly and chatty, orders were taken promptly to and drinks kept full. We then waited over 20 minutes for our apertisers, just some sharing nachos, which were delicious, bit wasn't happy with the delay. Then waited an additional 25 minutes for entrées to arrive, both simple burgers.  Mac & Cheese burger arrived cold, Mac & Cheese was refrigerator cold, sent it back after having to spit it out! Then waited an additional 20 minutes for a fresh burger to arrive, by which point my partner had finished and i had to rush eating mine. No discount provided except for an apology from our waitress and deterred from ordering deserts.

Nora A.,"Stoughton, MA",1,16,72,4.0,7/17/2017,"First of all, it is super super busy. Monday night and 1 hour and 15 minute wait time for dinner. The thing that my family and I noticed right away is the lack of care for the maximum occupancy. Inside it was WAY overcrowded and no one seemed to care. What if a fire broke out and no one could escape quick enough because the management is not professional enough. This is such. serious issue and should be taken to a higher level. It was hard to breathe and the air was hot. No AC.  So if you are claustrophobic, this would be a horrible experience.

We tried to hit here for an early lunch knowing how it gets packed but still the wait was super long :/ Got some shopping done while we waited and came back to find out they never really logged our buzzer in :/ was worried we got bumped but they squeezed us in for a late 2pm lunch :(  But like everywhere Cheesecake takes forever with their food, however the taste is always pretty consistent. The kids meals were so cute and ample-mini corn dogs. I like to get the huge club sandwich bc it's so shareable :) We love their fries! My husband and daughter love the Navajo Taco! It's not on the menu anymore but this location made it for them. So props to them. My teen son loves their Americano burger-so huge. Again we love their fries! Such a huge lunch. Service was good but again always super busy here. Funny how we never are able to enjoy a slice of Cheesecake bc we get so stuffed ;) Great lunch spot if you are at this mall.

Ive tried some cheesecake that are not too sweet and just right, but I felt like this particular cheesecake were too sweet and after a couple bites.. You don't want anymore. They're pricey too so you don't wanna waste money when you order something. However, I love their pina colada. It was the best I've had in a while. The service were good too.

A turkey sandwich and a side of soup. 7 more minutes elapse and 3 more entrees were delivered. The last person in our party finally received their food 5 minutes after that. A turkey burger. For my meal I ordered the shrimp spring rolls as an app (which I received with my food) and a veggie burger. I know veggie burgers can be hit or miss but this was a miss. Mostly comprised of rice than the veggies also listed it was very very dry. I thought I should send it back but I already waited this long for this bad attempt at a veggie burger. So I asked for extra ketchup and mayonnaise to try to make it a little less like a hockey puck. The spring rolls were good though, but it would have been nice to have earlier.

Chenae C.,"Davie, FL",0,22,5,1.0,1/19/2017,"So I really hate leaving bad reviews and honestly it takes a lot but this one was necessary. I love cheesecake factory but this location was absolutely awful. I placed a to go order because I was staying at a resort near this location in Orlando. I ordered the hibachi steak dinner which I frequently get it. My friend is the one who picked it up and brought it to me. She checked the food to make sure the steak was cooked at temperature with the person who put the meal together and everything looked good. Unfortunately my friend didn't know what was supposed to come with the meal and the prep person said nothing either. When it got to me the meal was missing the vegetable and the onions that are cooked with the steak which are my favorite part. It was literally just steak on a bed of beans sprouts in mashed potatoes. We were about 20 minutes from the location and also the restaurant had closed but I called the next morning and told him what happened this was Friday, January 13. A manager I spoke with took down my information and said they would give me a call back. I told him I just wanted my order made again and was still told I'd get a call back. Fast forward to Tuesday and I still have not heard back so I called again and at this point I'm back at home so I'm nowhere near this cheesecake factory I speak to a manager again and ask for them to just put it on a gift card or back on my card and I'm told someone will call me back so they can figure out what who handled my call initially it what went wrong (why I hadn't heard back). It is now Friday and I still haven't received a call back so now I've paid for food that wasn't made correctly and I am out of my money with no care from Cheesecake Factory.  I know this is not every location but this is this locations actions specifically. I took every route to handle the matter simply but now will have to reach out to corporate and will no longer dine here.

Alexandria T.,"Winter Haven, FL",201,15,171,2.0,5/25/2015,"Besides the difficulty of giving any establishment negative feedback with a low star rating, the most fatiguing task I have in front of me as I write this review is simply WHERE DO I BEGIN.  Let me do my very best at making an attempt to start somewhere, though I have so many things to say.  First off, upon going to The Cheesecake Factory at Millenia, I knew (thought I knew) what I was getting myself into. Its a chain, it is overly crowded, and the food is simply ok. The sad truth is that this establishment has been slowly declining over the years, and I remember as a teenager going here and having great meals (like their kobe burger). I regret to inform you, but those days are long gone my friends. My significant other and myself arrived starving. What we wanted was simple, and we weren't expecting gourmet: A chicken salad and a southwestern omelet. Two things that I frequently eat and can easily make for myself at home. So, it should be expected that any decent chef should be able to make these items with his or her hands tied behind their back. Right...  We placed our order; we waited. While we did so, I requested a laté. What I received was a water glass that was filled to the brim with coffee and foamed milk (oh yes I included a photo!). At first I thought it was iced, given the presentation and the fact that there was a straw included in the glass. Upon touching the drink I was shocked. It was laughable honestly. I have never seen anything like that before in my life. Quality folks! Quality over quantity. Its pretty hard to mess up something so simple, but that being said, they couldn't even properly cook our omelet. Its funny how the more I write about my experience, the more sense everything begins to make and the more I realize how truly horrible the meal was.  The omelet was overcooked and rubbery. Kind of like one of those yellow gloves you use to clean the kitchen. Enough about the omelet. On the pear and endive salad, I asked for the dressing to be placed on the side. What I got was a pile of drenched butter lettuce that looked downright sickly. It lacked color and the pear on the salad looked far from ""fresh"".  Sad. Two stars for the unfortunate food and the long wait accompanied by slow service. At least our waitress was kind! She was understanding and accommodating.  So I will now pose a question for you to meditate on as you contemplate your next meal with The Cheesecake Factory at Millenia. Why not skip the long wait and go to Denny's?  Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=100

Mícheál M.,"Orlando, FL",175,58,1194,2.0,5/26/2015,"Having been a longtime patron of The Cheesecake Factory I have a seemingly good idea of what to expect. Yes, it is a chain. Yes, it is busy. This particular location; however, has a number of problems. Being located at the Mall of Millenia felt like an advantage. I mean, it is a phenomenal spot. As a result, this location is packed to the brim with tourists. The hostess area is simply not large enough. I lost count of the number of times I was elbowed. So much so it became a conversation piece. The hostess staff definitely seemed in over their heads. Just abrupt, insincere and lacking care. Felt like I was doing them a disservice by being there. Just a poor experience.  After waiting longer than estimated, we were finally seated. Our waitress seemed sloppy and anxious to slip away. Inattentive and long waits between checking in. Case in point. My significant other ordered a traditional latte. What she received was a large water glass full of a poor interpretation. Disappointment mounted having to wait to address the big gulp coffee mess. The food was the last straw. I ordered a simple omelet. What I received was an overcooked slab of plastic. My significant other ordered a salad requesting the dressing on the side. Of course, she received a bowl of lettuce drenched in dressing. Ultimately, we were too fatigued to wait for replacements.  Bottomline: Recommend leaving this Cheesecake Factory for the tourists. For locals, there are far better options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=100

I was good just really small and thin, so for 4 people I suggest to get another appetizer too. I got the mushroom burger. It's really delicious they use  lots of Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Mayo, covered with Melted Swiss and Fontina Cheese. I subbed fries for steamed broccoli it came out perfect. My burger was medium-rare. My man got the Smokehouse Burger. Smoked Bacon and melted cheddar with crispy Onion Rings and B.B.Q. Ranch Sauce. He subbed fries for the sweet potato fries. Everything came out perfect and juicy great tasting combo. His brother ordered the Chilli Relleno Burger. It's  Charbroiled and Topped with Housemade Chile Relleno on a toasted Brioche Bun with marinated Onions, Chipotle Mayo, Cilantro, Lettuce and Tomato. It came with fries.he loved his burger.

Anna-Marie W.,"Orlando, FL",213,301,800,3.0,8/25/2014,"THE KITCHEN FORGETS TO PREP MENU ITEMS Recently Chad and I took a trip to the mall and I was determined to wait for a table.  I was ready.  I was prepared to sit by the fountain just outside the restaurant doors and be patient.  Turns out we waited only 2 minutes before being seated.  The benefits of traveling in a pack of only two. The tables are very tight.  We were placed in a two top along a wall of banquet tables, practically sitting on top of the table next to us.  It was fine, I was just happy to not have to wait the normal 45 minutes. We were immediately greeted by our server and we placed our order right away.  I am on the hunt for the best veggie burger in Orlando so that was an obvious choice for us, and we also ordered the lunch salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Our server brought us bread right way as well.  About three minutes after placing our order, we were informed that the kitchen had not prepped the veggie burgers for the day.  In looking through the rest of the menu, there are not a lot of choices for someone who doesn't eat a lot of meat.  There is no vegetable plate, there is no veggie sandwich.  The offerings were limited to a few salads and a couple of pasta dishes in which we could omit the meat.  I rarely order salads out anymore as I can fix a giant bowl of lettuce in my kitchen at home along with the toppings of my own choosing.  I think most Veggie Heads are tired of salads being our only options when dining out. I was devastated they ""forgot"" to prep the veggie burgers. The Salmon Lunch Plate was very good.  There are three styles of salmon to choose from- herb crusted, miso and plain grilled.  We tried the herb crusted salmon and it was some of the best salmon I have ever had.  The herbs weren't overpowering and complimented the fish very well.  The dish was served with a small scooping of mashed potatoes and three spears of asparagus.  It was a lunch sized plate, a decent portion for myself.  For someone like Chad who has a little bit of a bigger appetite I would recommend ordering the dinner salmon instead. We didn't bother with getting cheesecake.  I was bummed and wanted to leave. Our service was excellent but it is definitely not a place to sneak in for a quick lunch.  Plan your visit for a leisurely meal and make sure you don't get your heart set on any one thing on the menu like I did.  We will probably not return- I don't want to wait for a table only to find out they are out of the few things I can have. I really had my heart set on that veggie burger. 3 Sprouts- I would love to give 5 here but the kitchen just can't ""forget"" to make something on the menu. Especially to your veggie friends.

One ""wrap"" was 3 mid pieces of lettuce cut into pieces. Just a lazy ass expo guy or cook. The bartender came back out with some more lettuce to make up for it. For dinner was the Steak Madiera and Shrimp Scampi. Damn is that shrimp good! Instead of mashed potatoes i ordered the veggie medly of Snow peas, and carrots.

My only complaint is the wait. Especially at peak hours.  I understand that this just the nature of the business when you are this popular and good but it does get annoying to wait for a hour for a table.  Good news it that they text you when the table is ready and you have a mall to browse while you wait.

Stephanie T.,"Richmond, Canada",85,152,2794,4.0,4/23/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I wish we had some in Canada. If it's where I am on vacation, I will always try to go. The only issue is that there was a long wait time for a table, as with any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. At 7pm, the wait was 1 hour 20 min. As we were super hungry, we instead waited around the bar area for a table. These are first come first serve and we spotted a few tables almost leaving. We ended up grabbing one in 30 mins, which is a much more reasonable wait time than 1 hr 20 min. The waiter we got was very friendly, but since it was so busy there he had a lot of other tables to go to so at times we had to seek him or ask another waiter for him. It's always hard to order from the Cheescake Factory. Tons of variety and I want to eat everything. Factory nachos: huge plate of nachos with lots of stuff on top. The cheese seemed to be the cheez-whiz kind instead of shredded cheddar, though. Lots of toppings, generously layered, 6 people could share as an appetizer. Firecracker salmon: a must whenever we go. Super crispy, tasty salmon, very delicious. Underneath there is a bed of cabbage in a delicious sauce. The salmon is to be dipped in the brown sauce that is quite salty but tastes sooo good, especially when covering the cabbage ""salad"". We got the one on the regular menu because it comes with more pieces, whereas the one on the Skinnylicious menu has less and is not as worth it. Skinnylicious menu, lemon-garlic shrimp with pasta: The light menu is a great addition to the already humongous menu. There was really a light sauce with the pasta, and a few giant pieces of shrimp. It's supposed to be 550 calories and it really tastes like it. Perfect for those who don't want something heavy to eat. Skinnylicious menu, ahi tartare: it's chunks of raw tuna on top of avocado and in some dressing, with four chips around it. Pretty good, small portion, quite tasty. We always get this one too. Asian inspired! Chicken Bellagio: This could be shared between 3 people. It's a creamy pesto pasta with proscuitto on top and two giant fried chicken steaks. I don't have a picture of this but it was amazing. Quite a heavy dish and I don't think one person can finish it. Perfect for sharing and a good value! Key lime Cheesecake: this came with two huge dollops of fresh whipped cream. It's a little much for us so we just push it aside. The key lime cheesecake was quite sour and very hard, as if it was just frozen and still defrosting. I still ate it of course, but I personally would have ordered any other cake on the menu! Too sour! Overall, it was great. I love eating here and would go again. Not too keen on the long waits (reservations not allowed after 5pm). They even ran out of buzzers because so many people were waiting. Also, they seem to be a little understaffed although they should know how busy it gets every single night! Either way, love it here and would recommend 100%!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=120

So that was a hassle finally i read a sign on a chair waiting area that said approach the front desk. I didn't feel acknowledged they were so busy. Eventually he asked me how many in my party (2) asked if i wanted inside or outside (inside) he said ten min. 10 min later same guy goes to seat us and he's taking me outside, i told him i asked for inside and told us it was going to be 10 more min. I was willing to wait that actually despite how hungry we were because it was so hot outside. Well the waitress was nice i could not help but notice the piece of food hanging from her lip though, im like 99.9% sure she was eating something back there.

Ryan F. Was not pleased with me! Lol. I should have listened to her. Ok first of all we waited for over an hour for a table, they have a huge menu and while some people may love that, I feel that it's a bit overwhelming. I never know what to choose. I decided to get a few appetizers instead of an entree. The egg roll sampler looked cool but OOPS! SALMON! I'm allergic to seafood. So I asked the waitress if they could switch the salmon egg rolls with any one of the others in the sampler.  She went to check and said No! What?! Why?! So they can take it off, charge me the same amount and not add the other egg rolls. So the server's response was. ""Sorry, I just work here"". I ordered the chicken pot stickers and Texas egg rolls, awesome flavor and good portions for appetizers. My husband ordered the steak tacos which he said were good. And my son had the grilled cheese sandwich which both my husband and I snacked on as well. We also ordered the passion fruit mojitos which were delicious. But I was still a little peeved so it was difficult to be happy. Until..... The cheesecake came! I ordered the new Salted Caramel and my husband ordered the Strawberry.  I don't know why they bother to serve anything else. The cheesecake was perfect, sweet, and creamy. I think this will be strictly a dessert place for us from now on.

I do not give the full 5 stars rating simply because of the extremely long waiting time that I've experienced in the past at this location. Luckily, we got seated in less than 10 minutes during this visit. Food is great here, let's start with that. Anything you order will be delicious. Even the free bread is! You have a broad variety of drinks and cocktails to choose from, a great selection of appetizers and main dishes to order, and an incredible menu for desserts. Personally, I don't really like cheesecake (funny, right?), but they have other great desserts you can order that are not related to cheesecake in any way. Am I returning? Definitely! Hopefully sooner than later. However, they should at least crank up the range of their vibrating device for table-waiting. They should let you walk around the whole mall and still be within range.

We waited approximately 40 minutes to be seated, the mall was a madhouse. We began with the Pot Stickers and they were perfectly cooked and had great flavor. The soy sauce was flavorful and it wasn't overpowering. Our entrees were served on monstrous plates as always. I went with the Chicken Marsala over a large bed of Bow Tie Pasta. The chicken was juicy but the amount of pasta served was way too much. It was enough to feed 2 or maybe even 3 people. I was forced to leave a lot of it because pasta fills me up quick. The wife had Steak Diane & Madeira Chicken Combo. The portion of food was a bit more reasonable and she was able to finish with the help of my 4 year old son who for the most part only eats steak.  We chose the Hershey Cheesecake with Smores which was silky smooth. It comes with crumbled graham cracker and two mountains of whipped cream. We decided to share because of how full we were.

I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp and the server said it was more sweet then spicy,  I almost changed my order because I wanted it spicy but said she likes it spicy as well and has the cooks add more chili pepper flakes to it to bring up the heat. I asked her to have them prepare it that way as I wanted it spicy. My mom ordered the Garlic Noodles without chicken or shrimp. Food came out and my ""spicy"" Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp was anything but spicy...as in no heat whatsoever. Not to mention the small amount of chicken and shrimp in the dish, especially for a $18 dollar entrée. My moms Garlic Noodles were super bland with almost no garlic flavor to them. She had to have the server come back and load it up with parmesan cheese just to get any flavor on the dish.  We were pretty disappointed to say the least, especially for the price of the food. We don't mind spending the money, if the food warrants it but this meal did not. Sucks because we have fond memories of getting amazing food at location down South at the Sawgrass Mills mall.

And he has a cool tattoo on his right arm! He was very attentive, but not annoying, and he took very good care of my boyfriend's little brother, who is severely allergic to milk. Most restaurants and servers don't go far to make sure that he has a good time or try to see what other options, but he went above and beyond for him. So if you ever go to this one, ask for Pepe!  What I love about their menu is that it has so much variety. My favorite is the Crispy Chicken Costaletta - the lemon sauce is so yummy! It has 3 fried chicken patties and it comes with mashed potatoes & asparagus. I order this dish like 9 out of 10 times! Crazy, I know.  I'll give this place a 4.5. I was so amazed with the service.

Their drinks are also half off as well....If you can eat at cheesecake factory for less than $10...thats like the ""hitting the lottery"" Feeling.... TIP: If you are wearing dark pants and they give you a white cloth napkin...ask for a black cloth napkin....it help...no lint... :)  Favorite meals: Chicken Costeletta- Crispy chicken with a lemon sauce served with yummy mashed potatoes and asparagus....absolutely amazing and you will have enough to take home Buffalo blast - their version of boneless chicken wings...little pockets of buffalo sauce chicken served with great bleu cheese dressing.  Avocado rolls - little yummy crispy spring rolls with creamy avocado and the best little sauce to dip...."" I like sauces to dip...just saying"" Cobb salad---OMG...their balamic dressing is amazing....and this salad is huge...they chop everything very well and toss....nothing too special...normal ingredients but I love it.  Jamaican Black pepper shrimp...---WOW, shrimp in a spicy black pepper sauce...a little spicy; however, they give you this mango salsa which is refreshing along with relief from the spicyness...served with white rice and sweet plantains.... Enjoy folks....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=140
Doug G.,"Atlanta, GA",184,250,144,4.0,6/9/2014,"So, I usually try to stay away from reviewing chain restaurants, but what the hey!  We all know the food, the bountiful menu that takes 30 minutes to scroll through before ultimately giving up and changing your mind to the first dish you thought about when you first opened the menu! I never have an issue with the food here, ever. At all locations I have had the same consistent level of good food, but at this location the service received is something I was not accustomed to from a CF.  I will give creedance to the fact that this place is BUSY!! Not just busy, but B-U-S-Y most of the times for dinner. Im talking sometimes a 2 hour wait for a table on the weekend. So, advice here is get there early or have some shopping to do while you wait!

This was my first time visiting this location at the Mall at Millenia. I went to celebrate my birthday on a Friday night. The main reason we chose to come here was because we had a $50 gift certificate.  In all, I found that the entire experience was mediocre at best. The wait staff were not very friendly, and no one even cared to see how our experience was going. On top of that, it appeared as though the waiters were overworked, and frequently saw them running around appearing stressed.  In all, it was a mistake to come to this location, especially on a Friday night. When I return to a Cheesecake Factory, it will most definitely be the one in Winter Park.  One cool thing, though. Rather than giving you a pager while you are waiting, they now simply enter your phone number. When it is a few minutes before your time to be seated, you will receive a text.

It was a little chaotic in there, no real surprise as it was evening on the 23rd December and the mall was packed with last minute shoppers. They gave us a little buzzer thing and then told us to come back once the table was ready. About 15-20 minutes later it went off and we were taken to our table. A French Dip sandwich, Asian salad and a Grilled salmon were ordered, along with lemon tea, an unsweetened ice tea and... a Skinny Cosmopolitan. I asked my dad if he was sure he wanted it and he assured me that since it came off of the Skinny menu, it was alcohol free and that's all he wanted. I tried to reason with him but to no avail. The look on his face when it arrived and he tasted it was priceless! The food was surprisingly good, the French dip being the best I had had in a while and that's saying something.  We opted not to get desserts, choosing to have a quick meal and get out of there. It was a good quick meal and the place operated pretty slickly despite the massive load of people there.

Margie L.,"Liberty, MO",0,5,,1.0,2/25/2017,I visited this location this past weekend for my daughter's birthday. Sadly this was the worst experience I've had by far in any of the Cheesecake factory locations I dined in. The night started with a receipt telling us to come back in an hour to get a pager. When we returned in an hour for the pager the front desk indicated to us we had no wait and we should've got a pager right away. We were seated after an hour and 45 minutes. We were first greeted by one server who apparently was having a very bad night then later by a different server. Finally we had a third person bringing us items. The food was incorrectly placed therefore delaying half of our meals coming later. The server did not apologize but rather give us attitude about the change which clearly was her fault. We asked for a manager he came over to apologize but there was no sincerity and the apology was clearly scripted. Finally after asking four times the servers gathered to sing happy birthday to my daughter. I received no discount for the inconvenience rather I received a bill that was double the amount and I had  to ask them to change it.  Change in management and servers is needed immediately.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=180

Hubby had a piña colada and it was kind of blah... It was a virgin though.  For the appetizers we had the chicken wontons and the avocado egg rolls. Crispy succulent deliciousness. The sauce with the avocado egg rolls was sweet! That surprised me, and the fact that it went perfectly with the eggrolls.  My husband had the filet mingnon for his entree and it was beyond perfect. It was juicy even though he likes it well done. And sooooo tender!   I ordered the fish tacos. They were ok.. A bit bland but after a few sprinkles of salt they were good. They were tempura fried and on a corn tortilla. Also they would benefit from some hot sauce in my opinion, but there was none on the dish so I just left it.  But the STAR of the show was the cheesecake. My hubs got the s'mores one which was delicious, not overly sweet. You can taste every layer separately and the whipped cream and homemade marshmallow is top notch.  But mine.... Mine was... HEAVEN! White chocolate macadamia nut with a caramel drizzle. The name sends shivers down my spine. lol! Next time I will have dessert first. And if I have room maybe I will eat something else.  This thing was phenomenal. Not exaggerating.

Of course it doesn't hurt that you can wander around the beautiful Mall at Millennia while you wait.  We had a truly great waiter named Mario about 2 years ago. He went above and beyond with utmost professionalism, courtesy and tact when he saw that a member of our group was visibly upset (regarding a situation that had nothing to do with the restaurant). We were all so impressed and touched by how he handled everything; we even made a call to his manager the next day to send our compliments. He was THAT good. I've been back several times since then on vacation and each time the CCF does not disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=200
Joy J.,"Orlando, FL",12,334,2636,5.0,1/29/2012,"5 Stars goes for the Fried Sweet Corn Fritters!!!! OMG - I  have heard from others to try this appetizer and Last night was IT! I ordered this along with the Vietnamese Tacos and the Red Velvet Cheesecake. The Wait for us was about 90 minutes due to we wanted a ""Patio Seating"". We were there last night on a Friday night and it was pretty packed perhaps it was at the Millenia Mall and also a Friday. The service was okay due to we had to remind the server to refill the drinks.  Let me review the Food -- Fried Sweet Corn Fritters : I very much and also my palate enjoyed this appetizer. It was crunchy outside yet so soft and pillowy and somewhat creamy on the inside! Orgasm in the mouth! Its hard to really describe the pillowy taste of this goodness. The crunch of the sweet corn niblets added some touch to this food. The dipping sauce somewhat helped compliment the food it tasted of a honey mustardy sauce with a hint of spice. I took my time eating these (you get about 5 pcs per order) because i was just savoring the deliciousness of these fritters! Vietnamese Tacos - They used chinese soft white buns (similar to bao or siopao) that is split in the middle and stuffed it with bbq shredded asian pork and condiments of cilantro, bell peppers, onions and carrots. It is similar to a petite Bahn Mi but served taco style and the bread was more of a  fluffy bread and not toasted compared to a Bahn Mi. This was also tasty but so much reminded of eating asian bbq prk buns or siopao..There was a hint of spicey hot shredded vegetable that disturbed my palate for a few minutes. You get 3 small tacos for this appetizer. The presentation of this appetizer was colorful and great on the eyes. Red Velvet Cheesecake - This is my 2nd time on different occasions having this slice of dessert. I always go for it because the red velvet is actually GOOD!. The whole combination of the cheesecake, white chocolate shavings on top and red velvet cake is really music to my palate! It is somewhat rich so this time I didnt get to finish the whole slice. (to go pls?) Seating on the patio is I think a better experience than eating indoors due to the fact you get the view the array of people that shop at this mall and what shopping bags they have on their hands! LOLS Also it is not as loud as indoors IMO. The downfall to the patio is the heater lamps in which some complained it was too hot! Service could have been better with the drink service - However the food wait was not bad. Planning on coming here again for Brunch in a few weeks! Hopefully Patio service is better than last time we were here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=200

Servers are not properly trained. Every time we get our appetizers, the entree follows a minute later.  I mean how can you enjoy the appetizer and have chance to digest it. They rush you every single time. So this time we rejected the entree as we needed to finish the appetizer. We decided not to get the entree as the food was no longer fresh or was covered up. So you know things have landed on the food I.e spit, dust and other things. They asked they will make new food. Really? How can we tell it was not just heated in microwave. Crazy!

Linnette G.,"Oviedo, FL",66,20,15,4.0,3/20/2016,"My first visit here was so so. The cheesecakes are always on point, but choose menu items carefully or you'll end up with something you need to send back. Large parties are NOT accommodated for. There are no reservations. You have to stand there with your 10 plus party and wait. Half of them must be present prior to them even letting you check in. So pray that members arrive on time, or give them an earlier time to meet if you want to be seated by a specific hour. For a restaurant of this size and magnitude, that's kind of daunting, especially with the amount of tables available. We had cranky, then sleepy kids after the long wait, then finally getting seated, then finally getting the mediocre food. Upon my second (and third) visits, it was a more pleasurable experience. Second time three of us just met for cheesecake and I got a pasta something. It was delicious. For my third visit, it was just myself and a friend since she wanted to try the cheesecakes. The food tasted great on this occasion as well. Ambience is always on point, and I love how they dim the lights as it rolls into evening. Very smooth transition. I also ordered a specialty, sugar free cheesecake here for a friend's dad once. I asked for it about a week in advance, just in case. It was presented beautifully on the day I picked it up (Thanksgiving) and it was a hit with my friend as their dad appreciated the gesture! As far as cheesecake goes, they know their stuff! Service is good, especially for smaller parties. The food may be hit or miss, depending on your selection, albeit some items are slightly overpriced. They have SUCH a huge selection of food, though, that most anyone will find something they love. As for cheesecake, pay whatever they charge you! You get a hefty slice and it is DELICIOUS. Their ""to-go"" for cheesecake can be hit or miss though. I asked for two plain cheesecakes with no whipped cream as my boys don't like it and they brought them both with whipped cream. Had to send them back and wait again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=200

It seemed hectic though (maybe the proximity to Disney makes it seem stressful). Great waitress. Tip - there are lunch portions available for many of the entrees - Mom ordered the Shepherds Pie and Chick #1 ordered Alfredo - both came in lunch portion sizes. But for only a couple bucks more you get the dinner portion and have leftovers, you call it. I had the Skinnylicious Factory Chopped Salad - it was very tasty. Also had the Buffalo wings. The wings were served a bit cold and mushy but the flavor was there. Chick #2 had the Grilled Chicken Tostada - huge and smelled wonderful. All in all - it was a good lunch. Ordered two cheesecake slices to share - key lime - which was not really cheesecake - so don't bother; and a chocolate mousse cheesecake - very good. $100 for 5 - that's about right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=220

We both ordered a burger off their extensive menu of over 300 items- it was very difficult to choose since everything sounded and even looked really good. I now have a list a mile long of all of the different dishes and desserts that I'd like to try. I had the Kobe burger with sauteed mushrooms and onions which was absolutely amazing, although it came out slightly undercooked for how I asked it to be prepared. My fiance had the famous cheesecake burger which came on sourdough french bread and was actually 2 burgers for the price of one. I had the lemon-raspberry cheesecake which was just one of the choices of the 30 that they had available. I can honestly say that it was the best cheesecake I've ever eaten. My fiance had a slice of their massive carrot cake which was pretty good also.  Our waitress Miranda was really nice and attentive.  As far as the overall feel of the dining room it was extremely loud and very difficult to hold a conversation with my fiance and with our waitress. I'm not sure if it was because of where we were sitting or not..

My favorite dishes are the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, which is a red, peanut coconut curry and the Jambalaya.

The best thing about The Cheesecake Factory is definitely its menu.  It is pretty difficult to not find something you want to try.  While some dishes are certainly better than others, I can't say there is anything I have particularly not liked that I have tried here.

When we were seated we didn't get the booth that we requested but the hostess was extremely nice and made sure we were seated at a booth. Appetizer: Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip- My family liked it, I only tasted the chips.  Bread was okay but the butter was delicious. Food: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta- My brother thought it had no flavor, only spice. Grilled Salmon- My sister said it tasted like steak, I tasted it and it really did taste like steak with no flavor. Herb Crusted Salmon- No flavor. It was bad. The only good thing was the mashed potatoes. Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi- My mom said her salmon tasted like medicine, at least it tasted like something, unlike mine. She did not like the shrimp at all. Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane- My dad is not a picky eater. He was the only one that ate all of his food but only enjoyed the mashed potatoes.  We were all disappointed and I was ready to give this place two stars but my brother said ""let me taste their cheesecake, it is called the Cheesecake Factory"". He ordered the red velvet cheesecake and liked it. My sister and I split the strawberry shortcake because we hate cheesecake.

Karen B.,"Cincinnati, OH",111,119,2,3.0,5/11/2011,"I had only been to Cheesecake Factory once prior to the past week (when I went twice) and this time I actually had more than just cheesecake. I tried a few small plates since I wasn't starving at lunch time.  It's no lie that their cheesecakes are amazing ... Try to Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake or the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake (fudge cake, chocolate cheesecake, vanilla mascarpone mouse and chocolate). YUM. So indulgent.  So as most of my friends know, I'm a huge fan of avocado and I had NO idea they had Avocado Egg Rolls so I was ridiculously excited to try them. A beautiful plate came out with the egg rolls sliced in half and piping hot. The amazing colors of the avocado with the sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro wrapped and deep fried, gold brown were to die for. Tasting the blast of flavors when dipped in the Tamarind-Cashew sauce ... I seriously almost died and went to heaven. This appetizer is not something I would have guessed this place served ... or for that matter, I would not have thought it to be any good. Then I had the Ahi Tartare which, unfortunately, I was not so impressed by. It had more avocado, which I didn't know before I ordered, but it turned out to be less than yummy. The flavors were good and the presentation was nice, but the chewy, grittiness caught me off guard. I've had Ahi Tartare before but this time it didn't seem to be as fabulous. Our waiter, on a side note, was not very consoling when we complained about it ... or the fact that the glass my friend was drinking out of was chipped and he cut his lip on it. No offer of at LEAST comping the drinks. Anyway ... my friend had the chicken picatta which was actually JUST chicken without the picatta. Haha. It was lacking in the lemon flavor and could have used more capers. We ate it all... but it could have been more flavorful. As someone who definitely enjoys ordering chicken or veal picatta, I knew that this was lacking in the key ingredients. Overall, the cheesecake and avocado spring rolls will keep me coming back for TAKE OUT ... but the service and the meals will not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=260

Daniel B.,"Sanford, FL",27,143,47,4.0,5/20/2011,"We had a work outing to Cheesecake Factory today @ Mall of Millenia.  We felt like if it was our last lunch as fellow colleagues, employees and/or friends before the end of the world that we would attempt to make it a good one. My work friends are world-renowned Cheesecake Factory experts.  I would estimate that between them, they have visited Cheesecake Factory in at least 15 different cities nationwide.  The main impression that I was given was that Cheesecake Factory brought ridiculously inappropriate sized portions of food upon requesting an item off of the menu and that all of it was high quality. I wasn't skeptical, I mean these guys have a re-defined center of gravity that far exceeds my own and if this was their favorite restaurant in all of their travels who was I to question their judgement? First and most importantly, the bread was stellar.  I frequently judge a place by the bread that is delivered. We had a nice multi-grain and sourdough selection with real butter.  My dining partners both chose salads.  That selection was kind of ironic based on their enhanced figures, but I was assured that the 2 heads of lettuce per lunch salad serving would satisfy their most beastly nature and apparently, as the experts they were correct.  I stayed honest to my figure and went with the Orange Chicken.  The chicken was fresh and the coating was a nice crispy complement.  The orange glaze was perfect and the vegetables that come with the meal were very tasty comprising of snow peas, shredded carrots and zucchini.  Making things complete was an appropriate size portion of white rice. The real reason we came here was because my lunch mates found it hilarious that I have never tried cheesecake.  I am sort of a picky eater and always kind of skipped over it.  I've gotten a little better as I have gotten older but introducing the Cheesecake Factory virgin to their favorite place and celebrating the end of the world seemed like a good enough reason to take a 3 hour lunch.  The short story (after this novel) is that I like cheesecake and I like Cheesecake Factory.  I had no reason not to like cheesecake, but the selection I scooped from (Vanilla Bean) was completely amazing.  Feeling guilty, each of us called our wives and arranged to take pieces home to them too.  I had a good experience, and will probably go back sooner than later.  I was forewarned that it could be difficult to get in at peak hours.  It was a little noisy, but the interesting decor kept my beady little eyes happy.  The menu is almost intimidating with 16 pages (including ads WTF?).  I was frequently told during the one hour one-way trip there ""Everything is good; even though its a chain, I promise it doesn't suck"".  Truer words were never spoken to me during work hours and I plan on going back soon with my wife and the grrl.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=260

We were visiting Universal Studios in Orlando & wanted to steer clear of City Walk, so we came to the Millenia area & chose to dine at Cheesecake instead. It was about 8:15, and we were told there was a 45 min wait (not surprising). We were lucky, though, and found a high-top at the bar immediately without waiting.       We both ordered 20 oz craft beers ($8) and received them within minutes. I had the baja chicken tacos which were served in corn tortillas with avocado, fresh creme, tomatos & cheese. They were very tasty but I had to eat them sans-tortilla due to the tortillas being so fragile & falling apart. Otherwise, was not disappointed with my order.       My husband has the Shepherds Pie & it was AMAZING! It came out piping hot with a mushroom gravy, carrots, mashed potatoes & beef.

The problem occurred after, when she asked me again how many people and I said 7 and a baby (if that makes a difference). She rudely replied ""Well that's 8 and the wait time is different"". After a few minutes, she then said the wait time was 2 HOURS!!! I was taken by surprise and told her that we would like the take the table for 7. She then snarled ""You have a baby. That makes it 8, not 7"" and I replied ""It's a baby! He can sit on my lap!"" Then she went on and rolled her eyes at me and said ""Fine. Whatever you want"" I was so close to hitting her.

We were trying to find out where the Florida Mall was at and the waitress was very helpful in giving us good directions to get there. Then we came back again for breakfast after not finding a place at the IHOP by my house and my Mom and I had a delicious Huevos Rancheros for breakfast. This usually comes in huge doses so I was incredibly stuffed and satisfied by the time we were done. This is the first time I get sweet tea as well, when we got to the CF in Brandon they don't have sweet tea and give me a bland tea that I have to pour tons of sugar in, and I never can really get the right taste into it like in a already provided sweet tea. One of the things I love the most about the CF is the bread they give you while you wait for your food, and the sour dough bread was so delicious that I had more with my eggs, the perfect compliment to my meal.

BUT, this place pulls it off!  So let's start with Appetizers: FRIED MAC & CHEESE BALLS!!! THE BEST BALLS I EVER HAD! LOL They are so good, I have to have them any time I am at the Factory. They are creamy, the pasta is cooked al dente, the crispy coating it perfect. If you like mac & cheese you'll love these balls!!! LOL Next, Chicken Pot Stickers, once again a winner. They are light, the wonton is great and the dipping sauce, mium. On to the meal: Go for the Specialty Item of Caramel chicken. Every bite is white meat, crispy, and the Vietnamese caramel sauce is soooo good. Mixed with the rice and veggies, it is an explosion of flavors! It is my favorite dish. The Kobe Burger, ordered medium rare, was really good. It was flavorful and juicy. Tried the Thai Chicken pasta, this was the least of my favorites. It was salty and the pasta was clumpy, I'd stick to something else. Now, the CAKE! I will go in order of goodness: 1. Pineapple Upside down cheesecake! OMG! 2 of my favorite cakes, in one!

Michael G.,"Orlando, FL",60,261,506,4.0,7/16/2015,"Lots of times when I'm in Orlando, I end up eating here. Why? Well first of all, if you're craving some good cheesecake, you've come to the right place. Personally, I think I'm always craving cheesecake, especially from The Cheesecake Factory. This location is pretty centrally located in Orlando and located right near the highway. Despite its convenient location, there always seems to be a lot of traffic around Mall at Millenia, plus, good luck finding a parking spot near the entrance, but there is valet... I can't think of a time that I've come here and not had to wait for a table. Unfortunately, you can't make reservations in advance, so once you get up to the host/hostess you get on a wait list. Waits during prime lunch and dinner times, especially during the weekend can easily be over an hour. One good part about the wait, is you receive a text message when your table is ready. The food here is pretty consistent, which is definitely a positive, plus the complementary bread and butter is always delicious! They have a great grilled cheese here, but I highly recommend asking for cheddar instead of American cheese. The portions here are usually pretty big and there's no exception when it comes to the grilled cheese. They practically use a whole loaf of bread for the grilled cheese. I sometimes get the kids grilled cheese because the portion size is smaller but still more than enough. The ratio of bread to cheese is always perfect. I must say though the side of fries it comes with are nothing special. The fries are unusually slightly flimsy and don't have much flavor, but I've definitely had worse fries. The cheesecake is always my favorite part of the meal. You can't go wrong with any of the probably 25+ choices to choose from, but my favorite is by far the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. Just to let you know, most cheesecakes come with whip cream already on top plus when you order they put more whip cream on. With the huge menu here, you're bound to find something that you like - and be prepared to end up getting some of your meal to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=240
Jared V.,"Clermont, FL",44,194,17,4.0,5/12/2012,"I love this place.  I have liked the Cheesecake Factory since the first time I went to one in Chicago when I was 15.  The menu is ridiculously large-- it's a good thing this place is always packed because if they didn't sell everything on their menu regularly it would be a fortune to store all the wasted food. I have had several dishes but usually gravitate towards just a few after having some stuff I didn't care for.  I usually go for the cashew chicken or a burger, which they do really well.  I also almost always order an appetizer here (if you're gonna cheat on your diet, might as well do it right) and have found that their fried macaroni is excellent, as is their buffalo blasts.  There's never enough sauce or dressing for the buffalo blasts, and I always have to ask for extras at least twice (once to my server, and since they always forget when plating the dish, once to the person that brings me my food).   Of course the desserts are amazing.  They have really taken their namesake into consideration and make some truly excellent cheesecake.  Their hershey's chocolate cheesecake is outstanding.   The service at this location is pretty good. I've had pretty attentive service and have run out of beverage only a couple of times, but I have seen a couple of unprofessional things (a male server standing a couple of feet away from my table styling his hair and pulling it back into a ponytail, for instance).  Nothing to be too offended by, but still-- do that before you get to work or in the back so your guests don't see you putting your hands, hands that deliver food and beverages, all over your hair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=240

The service has been consistently mediocre to good, but where the fault lies is in the kitchen staff and their food prep. Every time the food has been prepared wrong and/or poorly. Notable examples include but are not limited to: Wasabi seared tuna-  Over seasoned and cooked all the way through. Mac and cheese burger ordered rare- Cheese was cold and bland and meat was medium, half burned. Smokehouse BBQ burger ordered rare-  Charred and well done. Etcetera etcetera.]  All in all, if I get a hankering for chicken and shrimp gumbo or Godiva chocolate cheesecake, I will be bringing my business to the Winter Park location, unless they too have grown just as incompetent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=240

Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,3.0,8/26/2009,"We knew we were going to find our way here during our vacation. I guess they didn't have enough funnel cakes, ice cream, cotton candy, turkey legs, and chicken nuggets while we were at WDW Magic Kingdom, because they wanted cheesecake.  This location is a little drive away from the theme parks, located in the Millenia Mall.  We arrived 7PM on a Wednesday night.  Even though it was a weekday night, it was still crowded, and we expected the usual wait for a table. We were handed a pager and were told the wait would be 30 minutes. Not bad.  After 45 minutes, we inquired on the status of our table, and were told one would be ready soon. Ten minutes later, our name was called, and we met with one of the hostesses. She escorted our group to our table, only to find that it wasn't cleaned from the previous party. With no apology, she just told us to wait back in the waiting area.  My wife noticed that there was a table set up for 7, and asked the hostess if this table was really meant for us. We were told it was being held for another party of 7, but they haven't all arrived. Since we knew that Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, we asked why wasn't this table given to us. With no answer, we asked to speak with a manager.  Finally we were seated, and asked the waiter if we can speak with a manager. He promptly brought him over and asked why the table wasn't available. He said they were waiting for the other table's entire party to arrive, but did acknowledge that the available table should have been given to us. What's more, he found out that the entire group of the first party didn't arrive, and the remainder of that group were already seated.  The manager apologized, and promised to do everything he can to make it up. Not only did he expedite our orders, he also helped our waiter serve them to our table. The waiter himself was very pleasant and very attentive.  The kids ordered the kids' bow-tie pastas of butter and parmesan, meat sauce, and chicken fingers. All of their orders were the famously huge Cheesecake Factory quantities.  After a day of theme-park food, most of the adults ordered salads (also to save room for dessert). The wives shared the Luau salad, which consisted of grilled chicken layered with mixed greens, cucumbers, peppers, beans carrots, and mangoes, all layered between two large wonton sheets, all in a vinaigrette. A very colorful presentation, and very tasty as well  My friend ordered an appetizer-sized Caesar salad with chicken breast. Again, even for a appetizer size, this salad was pretty sizable.  For myself, I ordered the Navajo Sandwich, which was a grilled chicken sandwich with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and red onion between a warm fry bread, with a side of their fries. (yes, you'd think I had enough fried food for the day, but apparently not). Good, sandwich, but didn't get to eat the fries because the kids went ahead and took them from my plate.  Couldn't forget about dessert, so most of us ordered cheese cakes:  Fresh Strawberry  Original  Chocolate Tuxedo Cream  Pineapple upside down Cheesecake (special of the day)  All were served promptly to our table. All were good and satisfied our sweet teeth, especially mine.  One of the kids ordered a kid's sundae, and a kid's strawberry and cream. The latter was for my daughter and was actually in error. She wanted a fresh strawberry for herself, which I purchased to go on the way out.  To ensure he would make up for the mix up for our tables, the manager comp'd for our desserts.  The responsiveness and the indifference from the front desk staff, who are the face of the restaurant, would have soured the dining experience for us, and would have prompted me to give a low rating. Instead, the prompt responsiveness from the manager, and the great service from our waiter indeed sweetened our evening, and offsetted the front desk's indifference.  The manager said that he will speak with the front desk on this to prevent the way the seating of our party was handled, and how to improve on their management of their waiting list, the availability of tables.  From the way he personally made up for them, I believe he will.  Why only 3 stars?

Katherine G.,"Morehead City, NC",0,13,,2.0,2/2/2010,I love their cheesecakes but watch out because some of them are very sweet and to sweet for my taste. Me and some friends ate here for a birthday celebration and I had never been. I was impressed with the wait staff but the food was way to expensive for what you got! I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was around $20/plate and it wasn't even traditional scampi like I thought. I even asked the waiter if it was over pasta or in butter and he told me it was in butter. When I received my scampi it was on pasta. When I asked him about it he just shrugged it off I was not impressed. The drinks were good but pricey.

Yes it's loud, busy and brash but you can't stop loving it. Located next to the Millenia Mall, it's ideally placed for you to go mental on the calories and then take a brisk walk up and down the mall at double quick speed to help pacify your conscience. What can I say? The interior is colourful. The staff are friendly and greet you with a smile. The seating leaves a little to be desired unless you are successful in securing a booth or a table outside where you can sit and watch the world and his dog go by. There is a full bar and the food menu caters for all tastes - I can thoroughly recommend the Shepherd's Pie! OK so you're supposed to like cheesecake but it's not obligatory. You can quite happily tip toe through the menu and not eat a single slice! Yes people will think you're odd but don't be put off. Simply make out you've already had your cheesecake quota for the day!

But there is no WOW factor here for me. The prices are a little steep in my opinion for the quality of food you receive.

Stacie M.,"Glenmoore, PA",0,10,,5.0,4/10/2013,"Where do I begin?  Tremendous experience last weekend!  I love visiting Cheesecake Factory and the one near my home is customarily at two hour wait.  So, I arrived at this location in vacation-town USA expecting something similar.  I was pleasantly surprised when I was greeted and told for my party of two it would be a 10-minute wait.  When I requested a booth, she then replied, ""20 minutes.""  This was great!  I was so pleased.  Within 13 minutes our buzzer went off and we went up to the counter to be seated. At other Cheesecake Factorys I have been to you then wait in a small line among others who are also being seated so I thought nothing of it.  The manager then walks up to my husband and I and tells us he is terribly sorry for the inconvenience and he will be giving us a free appetizer.  My husband and I did not even realize there was an inconvenience because this little pause is very common at other locations.  We were kind of confused why he seemed so eager to help us and when we were actually seated we learned from the hostess that there was another party who seated themselves in what was supposed to be our booth.  So, they scrambled to find another booth for us.  While we were ordering our drinks, the manager came over to our table, apologized for the inconvenience and told our waiter that we were to receive a FREE APPETIZER AND FREE CHEESECAKE!  He again thanked us for our patience and apologized.  We could not believe it.  It was amazing customer service!  Most restaurants do not care too much about pleasing their guests.  This manager, Shannon, went above and beyond and we cannot say enough about his interest in making the guest experience a fabulous one.  Additionally, the food was excellent!  Very fresh, hot and tasty!  I will certainly be revisiting this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-orlando?start=340

It did take about 15 minutes more to actually be seated which was disappointing.  After being seated our drink and app order was taken in a reasonable amount of time. 10 minutes later our drinks arrived and about 5 minutes after that the fried mac n cheese came. The fried mac n cheese is really tasty but I was confused if I should eat it with my hands or with a fork and knife. No worries I did both and either way works ok.  We made our entree order and I chose the Chicken and Shrimp gumbo. When it arrived it looked and smelled delicious. I am happy to report that it tasted very good too especially after kicking it up a notch with hot sauce. I like my gumbo spicy. The cheesecake here is good but not great in my opinion. The number of options is incredible but call me boring. I like a big, dense piece of plain cheesecake. The way it should be. A great cheesecake doesnt need four or five ingedients stuffed inside.

It was perfectly executed (in terms of being bland/lifeless) with a side of undercooked potatoes. In an attempt to add some type of flavor, they drizzled a weak hollandaise sauce over the Crab Hash, but failed miserably. Not even Tabasco sauce can save this dish from the pain and suffering it endured. The servers' attitude certainly didn't help either.
