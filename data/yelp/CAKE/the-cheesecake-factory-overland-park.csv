Jill V.,"Manhattan, KS",12,15,1,5.0,9/28/2014,Came here with my brother and mom for a late lunch.. We got there right at 2 so we asked if my brother was too late for the brunch special (it ended at 2 PM) and the server said no problem... So he was able to order what he wanted. He got a Belgian waffle and it was really good. My mom got the chicken tacos and she liked them. I had the pasta da Vinci and it was great! Pasta with chicken and mushrooms. I recommend it. We all had cheesecake and other than it being amazing there is not much more to say!! Great experience and our server was attentive. Will be back :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100
Christyn K.,"Kansas City, MO",259,481,234,4.0,1/1/2012,"Went here for a birthday with 20 of my closest friends. Called a few days ahead of time to make sure we could all get seated within a reasonable amount of time after my guests arrived. ""We don't take reservations, but come an hour early,"" the hostess said, ""and if someone if here for your party the whole time, we will have you ready to go come 6:30."" So, I dropped my husband off an hour early and left to run some errands, only to get a phone call from him minutes later saying that our name is on the list but they don't need us to be there. So I turned around to get him but stayed behind just in case. Long story short - my whole party had arrived by 6:30 but we stood in a poorly lit foyer for another 30 minutes before they would seat us. And not even seat us all - though when we got there the hostess admitted that one of our 5 tables wasn't ready yet so some of my guests would have to stand while we physically waited for a table of two to get the hint that they had been there too long. My husband finally had the nerve that the staff didn't and to asked the couple to leave. I love Cheesecake Factory. I LOVE it. However, I was pretty bummed that we were given the short end of the stick considering that we were worth 10 of those tables of two. Next time I have a large group I am going somewhere where I know we will be treated like a priority.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100
Ganesh S.,"Olathe, KS",0,20,15,5.0,2/6/2012,"Went here as a part of a group whose anniversary fall on the same date. There were about 14 of us with a mixed of vegetarians and non-vegetarians.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and told us all about the menu and which had meat products and which did not, even the vegetarian looking entree's had chicken broth in them. So she clearly steered us in the right direction.  All in our group was extremely impressed with the level of service we received.  The menu offers a wide variety, a little bit of everything for everyone. We ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp and my wife for the Thai Chicken Pasta. Yummy! It was so filling, we have to take half of it home, we also ordered the Tiramisu cake, delicious!  Restaurant was packed on a Friday night as it was expected, they had a pretty good waiting lounge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100
Bloss C.,"Jersey City, NJ",731,1014,2378,4.0,6/27/2012,"I have heard about the Cheese Cake Factory for a while..... finally got to see what all the hype is about.  The location I went to was huge, reminded me of a casino restaurant in Vegas in terms of décor and size.  There was a 15 minute wait, but that wasn't too bad because they give you a pager thing.  Explored the cheesecake selection at the take away counter while I waited, lots of variety, but they all looked too sweet.  Our waiter Craig was supper nice, professional, and courteous.  I was impressed with the service.  I was also impressed with the food.  They have EVERYTHING on their menu.  In fact, they even have 2 menus, regular and the SkinnyLicious.  I ordered off the skinny menu, a mojito, Farro salad (Farro, Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Beets, Red Onion, Feta Cheese and Tzatziki. Tossed with Vinaigrette), grilled artichoke, and split a flatbread (Garlic, Shallots and Fresh Herbs) with my friend.  Everything was good.  I least enjoyed the faro salad, next time I think I'd order the mediterranean salad  which has the same flavors minus the faro.  The artichoke was boiled to cook it and then grilled, which gave it a nice smokey flavor.  It was served with a balsamic vinaigrette instead of the traditional butter aioli, which was ok.  Loved the flatbread, but even with two other dishes, I do not recommend sharing at as you will want all six incredibly small pieces for yourself.  My total bill was $23 before tip= AWESOME!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100
Lisa Y.,"Overland Park, KS",0,5,1,5.0,3/17/2014,"Ate here today for lunch and the food was divine!! Boyfriend got the barbecue salmon and I had Evelyn's favorite pasta which was a vegetarian pasta.

Gordon A.,"Lenexa, KS",0,1,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Ate here tonight and was greatly disappointed with the service. Server had no people skills. Actually had no server skills either.

L A.,"Raymore, MO",0,2,,3.0,8/22/2015,"My family just left this location, we ate dinner this evening on the patio. We have eaten here many times and always been fairly satisfied, however this evening was an awful experience. We were there to celebrate a birthday, and I feel bad for my sister in law that she had to endure that as her birthday dinner.  Let me say that the food was fine, other than a very room temperature and soggy salad for my husband. Our waitress, Tanya, was so unfriendly that it was strange. She had to be asked several times for water, kids menus, and drink refills, which we had to flag her down to get. She never checked on us unless someone was waving their arms. She left salad plates and bread plates on the table that was small to begin with, so that my husband finally moved them to a bussing station himself so as not to elbow one to the floor.  What should have been a decent experience was just plain uncomfortable. We were all very frustrated, by the end of dinner, and she took so long to come back, that we left without dessert, which was kind of the part some of us were most looking forward to.  I won't not go back, simply because we probably won't be seated in her section in all likelihood, but if we are I'll ask for a different server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100
Patrick S.,"Overland Park, KS",1,41,1,2.0,5/14/2011,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times before and I generally leave satisfied, despite the ludicrous prices, but tonight was a different story. After looking through the 30 page menu for a good ten minutes, I decided upon the ahi tuna tatiki salad. A few minutes after my waiter took my order, he returned to tell me that they had run out of the ingredients and I would have to choose another dish. No biggie, so I restarted the arduous task of searching through the menu. I decided on a separate pasta dish, but the price was upscaled $5 from the salad I was intending on getting, so I asked my waiter if given the mishap he would be able to discount the difference to make up for it. He said he'd take care of it so I went on with my meal satisfied. Lo and behold, when the check rolled around, no discount had been added. I pointed this out to my waiter and he left for what seemed like thirty minutes to go discuss it with his manager. When he came back he regrettably told me they could not discount the dish, but would be willing to offer me half-off a dessert. I told the waiter I was not interested in dessert and he said there was nothing else they could do, so I took my own discount out of the waiter's tip. It's a shame because the waiter himself was friendly and accommodating, but the management's incessant attempts to nickel and dime their customers is appalling and has driven away a consistent diner tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100
V. M.,"Leawood, KS",1,59,,3.0,6/27/2012,We started off with a bunch of dirty silverware that looked like they just left it from the last people.  A kind of angry look from the waitress when we asked for some clean stuff almost finished it.  We decided to stay and give it a try anyway. Pasta carbonara was pretty good and service was good as well. Everyone liked their food and had a good time and there were no other disturbances. Overall OK.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100
C L.,"Olathe, KS",19,160,7,3.0,1/30/2011,"You'll never hear me say, ""Let's go to The Cheesecake Factory!""  However, at a girlfriend's suggestion, we made a visit.   I always dread looking through their menu - a hundred pages of boring eats that they dress up with exotic names or fancy descriptions to entice those that are looking for an ""upscale"" [eye roll] experience. I ordered Miso Salmon.  To my surprise, it was a decent dish.  The fish wasn't over-powered by the glaze and I quite enjoyed the white sauce that surrounded my bed of rice.  I believe the description said it was a miso sauce, but I didn't taste a hint of miso in it.  It really tasted like a beurre blanc.  The snow peas were nice and crisp, though I'd wished there were more than five.  I will say that the salmon was slightly overcooked in one area, which was a turn-off, but I let it slide since they aren't exactly known for their seafood.  Also, there was a disproportionately large amount of rice compared to the size of the fish atop it, and it was some cheap, sad variety of poorly-cooked sogginess.  My friend had a chicken salad sandwich.  She said it was good, but I didn't sample it, as I don't see the appeal in any such entree. Our service was extremely slow, but the server was friendly enough.  Besides, we were there to chatter away and we overstayed our welcome by an hour (not during peak hours, it was after the lunch rush...I'm not rude).  This place is really overpriced for what they have to offer, but at least they have a variety of options.  And the entree I had last week makes me feel better about my inevitable next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100
Ali C.,"Harrisonville, MO",7,65,3,4.0,2/1/2014,"I prefer this location over the one on the plaza. This one is much nicer and the food is much better. The service has always been great, regardless of how busy they are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100

JC A.,"Overland Park, KS",0,35,2,4.0,7/23/2011,"Went to Cheesecake with a bad attitude because Figlio was so close to closing the hostess acted like she didn't want to seat us. So with our foul mood, Cheesecake managed to turn our night around. I was anti- Cheesecake because it's a huge chain.  Shame on me they did a great job. Every single person that dealt with us was professional friendly and upbeat.  The hostess, the bartender, our server and a  manager  that stopped by table during the meal, all great.   (And it's not like we complained or told anyone there we were ticked off at another restaurant.)  We showed up, put on waiting list,  Friday night 9pm.  Had drinks at bar, seated in 25 minutes.  Server was friendly and helpful.   Menu is not my cup of tea-too much over flavored salty things BUT I got a simple pasta dish and it was good.  Dining partner had a chicken lemon dish that he practically licked the plate clean.

Brenna P.,"Kansas City, MO",48,300,85,3.0,10/12/2010,"I stopped in here for brunch around 11 AM with a group of people on a Sunday afternoon.  We were promptly seated and our drinks were served quickly.  I glanced over the menu and quickly realized that it was a bit overwhelming.  I also realized that despite the menu being several pages long, it is somewhat lacking when it comes to vegetarian entrees. I ended up ordering the huevos rancheros.  The eggs came served on two corn tortillas, with fresh avocado, black beans, tomatoes, and salsa.  The dish wasn't exactly up to par in the spice department, so I requested some Tabasco sauce to give it an extra kick.   My girlfriend had the French toast.  I had a few bites of it, and it wasn't really anything special.  In fact, it pretty much tasted like some of the French toast I've prepared at home.  I was really expecting something a little more elaborate. The food I had probably wasn't worth the price tag, but it was good.  Not great, just good.  I didn't partake in any cheesecake, so I can't comment on that aspect of the food experience here.  This is the kind of place I wouldn't likely return to if I chose a place to dine.  However, I wouldn't hesitate to go again and try another dish if someone invited me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100

I would have given a 0 out of 5 stars but that is disallowed. I had the mushroom burger which was bland and edible. My wife had the chicken picata which looked good until we found what was either a wire or a bug's leg. I dont know because the server whisked the plate away to show the manager as soon as we alerted her. Either way, it was disgusting and I will never eat there again.

Chinatsu V.,"Lenexa, KS",25,22,5,3.0,12/9/2014,"Usually both food and service are good. But last time we were there, we got a new server (she told us she was new) and we had a not-so good experience. Sure, she was still a new server there, but couldn't they put someone a little bit more trained for our table since we had a young son who is not so patient. We waited for our drinks for 15 mins. Alcohol drink came out before water or my sons juice. My sons food came out next, but didn't get his juice yet. so my son had to eat most of his meal without any drinks. Finally I had to get up and asked another server for our water and juice. Waited another 20mins for our food. My husband ordered his burger medium rare but came out well done. But since my son already finished eating by the time our food came out, we did not ask to remake the burger again. (Didn't want to wait 30 more minutes for another one) I didn't give 1 or 2 stars because I know usually they are good. I wish our server could have some help from other experienced server.

Herra H.,"Lenexa, KS",38,17,10,3.0,12/19/2014,"We went here as a large group of 14-15. We had called ahead of time and asked for a reservation and when we got there at the time they told us, they said it was going to be another 45-60 minute wait. We were starving and decided to wait in the lobby. The floor manager wasn't very polite, I understand we were a bunch of students waiting, and we did crowd the lobby a little but she did not have to treat us with such disgust. We didn't mind though, what really set me off was when an elderly man had walked in with his wife, he had made a reservation too,  and she said ""you will have to wait, we accidentally have given your table to someone else"". What is the point of making reservations if you won't even get the table?  To pass the time, some of us went to the whole foods and explored the area. When we came back, we were finally seated but it was so crowded! We were seated in next to the booths. For drinks we had Ordered ""house made lemonade"". The rims of the glasses were coated with sugar and it was very sweet. It tasted like all the flavoring was at the bottom of the glass and the top was water. I had ordered the chicken farfalle pasta. Now originally it comes with pacetta and mushrooms, but I do not eat pork or beef and I hate mushrooms, so I asked if I could have it without them. It took about 20-30 minutes before the food came, we had bread and butter at our table. When we finally got our food, I dug straight in. I first noticed that there were mushrooms in it, i disregarded it. But then as I took and bite, I tasted something strange. They had put pork in my pasta. I immediately started crying and freaking out, considering its against my religion to eat pork, I had gotten the manager, I was teary eyed ,and she brushed me off and called the waitress. I do not think they understood how upset I was. The waitress sent it back. In 10 minutes I had gotten the replacement, however it did not have the same saucy texture and it was piping hot. The food looked okay but my appetite was gone. My friend said however, it was not the best. Considering how over priced it is, the service and the food, we should have went to Olive Garden. However, the cheesecake was DELICIOUS! The one positive. The restaurant itself was Egyptian themed which was interesting. The bathroom was fim and it smelled good, which is weird.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100

A D.,"Leawood, KS",22,127,47,1.0,8/12/2017,"After being seated at a table with no utensils. The hostess grabbed some and threw them on the table saying here ya go. I was waiting for the bf to grab a jacket because it was chilly and was asked by the waitress our drink orders. I eat here quite often but it's usually to go. Which is what I should have stuck with. I ordered a appetizer salad. That came out in a chilled bowl which was probably the highlight of my meal. After placing our order for the main course we sat for roughly 25 min and was then told that my order( ahi tuna) wasn't in stock. Well that's great but now his food is up and I have nothing to eat. ON MY BIRTHDAY! Great the one time I decided to eat in the only thing the offer is an apology and the meal on them. Honestly it left the worst taste in my mouth because it was the lack of care. The manager only had a cavalier attitude and a ugh so what approach to fixing the problem. Now it's 15 min before midnight with nothing else open in the area. My thought is if they was cooking orders together this would have had been figured out well before that steak had time to cook. We came together, to eat together, and drink together. Which the waitress decided to bring my Arnold palmer once his food was done. By that time I had already got to the level of pisstivity that I couldn't drink it. I AM OFFICIALLY DONE WITH THIS CHAIN TOGETHER. Neither location can seem to get it right and I have spent way to much money, time, and patience in this place.

Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",994,1007,3062,5.0,4/8/2015,"I just feel like it is hard to go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. There are so many options, your whole party will find something to eat. I've never had a bad experience with any of the dishes I have ordered at the Cheesecake Factory.  My family and I made a weekend trip to Kansas City and we came here. We knew we wanted to come here, since we use to live in CA near a few cheesecake factories and then moved to AR with no cheesecake factories. We were really excited to come eat! WAIT/PARKING: We came on a Saturday evening around 6ish. It was really crowded, but we didn't have too long of a wait fortunately. About 30 minutes.  The restaurant is located in a small shopping center. There is a decent amount of parking, but it is a busy restaurant, so parking can be hard to find. We had to park near Whole Foods, which is in the back of cheesecake - not far. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Our waiter gave us great customer service. Very friendly and helpful. FOOD: I've ordered quite a few dishes at Cheesecake Factory. Lately, I've mainly been ordering off of the skinnylicious menu. Can't beat yummy and healthy! I've had several items off of this menu and they have all been delicious and filling. This trip I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad. So yummy, ate it all! It was a large portion too. Which, btw, all of cheesecake factory dishes are good size portions. Usually you will have left overs.  My husband ordered the Italian Sandwich and loved it.  We had our 2 year old daughter with us. At all restaurant locations they bring out a smaller plate of fruit and bread to you if you have a small child. Not sure whicha age is the cut off for that. It is such a nice gesture and I appreciate them taking that extra step to treat the kids good and help the parents out ;). Then we ordered cheesecake... I mean c'mon, how can you pass it up when dining here! I've had a good amount of cheesecakes here and they are all yummy. This time I ordered the Hershey's Cheesecake - oh my yum! My husband had the Reese's Peanut Buttercup Chocolate Cheesecake- also very delicious. We had leftovers from our cheesecakes. Very delicious, but both rich that we weren't able to finish them. However, I finished mine later for my ""4th"" meal haha.  Other cheesecakes I love: fresh strawberry, s'more, 30th anniversary, godiva, raspberry, peanut butter cup fudge, and chocolate mousse.

There's nothing like rolling out of bed and enjoying a slice of key lime cheesecake while dancing in your kitchen, preferably at the counter closest to your refrigerator. It's divine.

The Firecracker Salmon only cost a little less than an entree, but what I got was a large plate, half of which was covered in red cabbage, the other half with 4 wimpy little spring rolls swimming in sauce. Scarcely more than a bite each for a party of 4.  The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was delicious, though the amount of chicken and shrimp seems to be have decreased somewhat. Louisiana Chicken Pasta was ordered from the lunch special, and was also quite good and not overly salty! Definitely don't come here if you're calorie conscious.

Emily B.,"Olathe, KS",0,10,,3.0,8/7/2016,"Had lunch there today, it was alright.  My husband and I noticed that the knives, a napkin, and one of the appetizer plates on the table were obviously filthy, so we had to ask for clean replacements right off the bat when we sat down. A short note - they have tons of dishes to choose from, so unless you're a regular or you absolutely love a very specific dish, be prepared to search through a huge (approx. 20 pages) menu. We ordered the (pork?) potsticker dumplings; those were pretty good.  I ordered their 'Factory Burger' for my main meal, and quite frankly, I was disappointed with what I got.  The bread was hard and tough to bite through (unlike the appetizer bread), the onions on the bottom were sort of sad-looking, and while the meat was cooked as ordered, the meal itself didn't come out very hot (unlike the plate).  In hindsight, I should've ordered what my husband had, the 'Bacon-Bacon' burger.  That looked a lot more satisfactory, to be honest. The portion sizes are pretty big, so if you choose to order dessert afterwards, I suggest you get it to-go.  I ordered the Mango Key Lime cheesecake, which tasted lovely (but I do wish they'd cut back on the coconut a little bit).  However, for what it's worth, the prices for just about everything on the menu are...too pricey.  An appetizer (some running about $7-$9) here could get you an -entire meal- elsewhere. As far as service goes, it was decent.  Nothing particularly outstanding or terrible. In short, avoid the 'Factory Burger', it's a total rip-off.  As a whole, the restaurant is a nice treat...once in a while, when you've got the -extra money- to splurge.  It's on the (much?) more expensive end for casual restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20

M. O.,"Overland Park, KS",80,174,296,3.0,2/12/2016,"Being from a small(er) town, I recall my early experiences with Cheesecake Factory being a BIG DEAL.  When my wife (then-girlfriend) moved to Kansas City from the aforementioned village, nearly every big experience was celebrated with a dinner date out to the Cheesecake Factory on the Country Club Plaza in The Big City.  We gladly suffered through three-hour-and-thirty-minute waits on Saturday night, just to be ""on the Plaza"" and seemingly more awesome than all the pitiful fools we left behind from our misspent (mis-located?) youth. The basics haven't changed in 10 years - nice, clean venues, consistent decor, strong service, enormous menu covering cuisine from all seven continents, and, yes, hunger-pain-inducing long waits on the weekends. My last three visits have all been relatively more of the same, with the exception that each one missed a step in one of the above areas.  On the former two occasions, the food quality had seemingly dropped off a tick. For a decade, I would have rated it 4/5 stars, but it's dropped to 3 - 3.5.  Still strong, especially considering the breadth of menu options the obviously-skilled CF chefs have to be able to create, but down a notch.  Quantity is still enormous, which is to say just fine. On my latest visit, I feel we were slighted on the usual above-average service end of things.  Our waitress was a little more in tune to the pompadour-haired bartender than her waiting duties, both on our table and others'.  You may be thinking, ""But, M.O., you yourself pointed out just how crazy-busy the Cheesecake Factory is!""  Yes, Yelp brethren, while this is normally true, on this occasion it was a mid-winter Thursday evening from 9:00 to 11:00 pm in the bar.  We were but one of three spots in the entire bar area taking up space.  So few tables to tend to should have meant better-than-average service, however we received the opposite.  Nitpicks aside, Cheesecake Factory remains a strong, albeit predictable, choice for a good meal alongside half the metropolitan area.   TIP: Get the cheesecake. Any of them. Obvious, yes, but almost so much so that you might be tempted to eat that entire 14-pound plate of delicious pasta instead of leaving room for dessert.  There's a reason the dessert name made the façade, folks!

The place is always busy. Let's face it. Always. This place turns over some insane amount of business. We walked in, and were not at all surprised to find ourselves a 10-15 minute wait. No biggie. We were given a little light up thing, and told to wait. The wait actually was pretty quick before it light up and began vibrating, telling us it was time to sit. We went back to the host stand, they took our light up thing, and then.... We waited. They lost our table (?) - they forgot who we were (?) - we waited almost 10 more minutes, before they finally asked ""What was the name? It'll be a 10-15 minute wait."" Uh... yea, no. I informed them we had waited, and already turned in our light up thing that should have gotten us a coveted seat at the wonderous Factory a la Cheesecake. They did find a table for us. A table, towards a corner of the restaurant, that sat exactly 2 people, and the table left little room for 2 waters, let alone food or bread. But, it was a table. The waitress took about 10 minutes to come to us with waters, another 10 to bring the drinks we ordered.. and the food. Sigh. Mom ordered an omlette - eggs people. 10 minute cook time, max.. I ordered a salad - the tuna tataki salad - RAW... and still, our food took 47 minutes to arrive to our table. I had watched another couple who came in after us, were seated after us, order drinks, an appetizer, their entrees, and 4 slices of cheese cake to go, and they were out.. before we even received our food. The waitress wasn't necessarily a bad server. She was friendly, and kept a smile on her face, even knowing how frustrated we were with the incredibly long wait, and ticket times.

You can see how well this strategy has worked for Houlihan's. The menu is a page after laminated page of soulless beige dishes. Nearly all of their signature dishes are chicken unless you added some shrimp. Portions used to be enough for three meals. Not anymore. This is a one setting dish now. This place isn't cheap. For the portion size they presently serve it is way overpriced.

They have their lunch specials every day until 5 p.m. I will say, the menu reads like a chapter book with ads separating the genres of food they offer. So if you're indecisive, tell the waiter you'll need more than a minute. On top of that, they have plenty of awesome dishes to choose from, which doesn't make the process any easier.  I've found that all the pastas, have had them all, are fantastic. My favorite pasta is the Carbonara and Da Vinci.  If you're feeling adventurous, you can have your dessert before your meal. As you walk into the place, they have their cheesecake bar on the right side, before you're greeted by their front-end staff. My favorite cheesecake they offer, currently have 60+ cheesecake flavors and always adding/substituting, is the Banana Cheesecake. It's a cheesecake with a hint of banana flavor with whip cream and fresh bananas cut on top of the cream. So good. If you don't see your favorite cheesecake on there anymore, you should ask to see if they still offer it.  For the quality of the food and immense choices, the price is very reasonable.

The salads should have two prices a price without meat, then an option to add meat for an additional charge. By doing this the vegetarians won't feel 'ripped off'.  I tried the portabella mushroom sandwich. The portabella had a tough skin and wasn't enjoyable at all. The grilled cheese is very good but with a menu like their I shouldn't have to order a grilled cheese. I usually order the Chicken Thai lettuce wraps and sub avocado for the chicken.

The one thing I like about chain restaurants is that I can rely on items being available (I honestly think that's what their high points are, you know what the expect).  With that said, I went to The Cheesecake Factory Saturday afternoon because it was National Cheesecake Day. I am not one to ignore such a day so I decided to stop by and pick up a slice of cheesecake (the deal they had going was half off a slice of cheesecake/1 per customer).  I decided to go to the bakery counter and get my cheesecake to-go. The girl taking my order was extremely sweet and patient as I decided exactly which cheesecake I wanted to try. I went for the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake....let me tell you it was the most divine piece of cheesecake I have had in a long time. It has a macaroon type crust, tons of coconut and chocolate chunks throughout the cake. I of course could only eat half of it and left the other half for later (I can never finish a slice of cheesecake). So if you're a fan of coconut cream I highly recommend this cheesecake and for those that are rolling their eyes saying ""why don't you just make your own cheesecake instead of supporting a chain"" my answer to you is, if you'd like to spend the $50+ for the ingredients for the cheesecake I make (real honest to goodness NY cheesecake) then by all means please send me a check or money order :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=120

Aaron G.,"Olathe, KS",61,161,34,4.0,8/5/2009,"I enjoy this particular Cheesecake Factory.  The food here is pretty good and I know my wife prefers it here because of the way they cut the chicken on the Santa Fe Chicken salad (which I highly recommend) as opposed to the one on the Plaza.  The Plaza one thin slices the meat and it just doesn't taste the same.  The one out on 119th is oh so yummy in my tummy.  I've had the Jambalaya and the Crusted Chicken Romano and those are both good too.   I am not really big on their steaks and would never go there for steak.  There are too many other great restaurants for that, but I will say that everything else is pretty good.   The only thing I don't like is the how they have the seating arrangement.  If you want to have more private conversations, make sure you request a booth.  The tables are so close together that you can hear everyone else's conversation and no doubt they can hear yours.  Plus, the waiter's butt usually ends up in your face when the other tables are being served.  Not a good situation if the waiter farts while serving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=120

But it seems like every revisit, the place seems to have gone downhill on service. Maybe there's better competition based on new experiences elsewhere. We had a birthday in the family, and was eager to have a great enjoyable dinner. We waited about 1 hr for our table, reason was big party of 8. Hence, we see parties of 9-10s that came after us that got seated before us. Then finally, we get a table and the server tells us all the fresh fish is out, even not your frozen cod or whatever fish they use for fish n chips is out. Then after talking to the manager, all of a sudden the delivery truck just delivered fresh fish on a Sunday evening, after we already ordered. Needless to say the food was okay, wasn't worth it all that wait and scarce menu options.

Brad C.,"Overland Park, KS",2,25,,3.0,9/12/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is very much a love/hate type of restaurant.  I think it lies somewhere in between a VERY upscale Applebee's and the type of mega-sized gourmet restaurant you would see in a Vegas casino. They get points for their diverse menu selection (the menu is a 10+ page book!) and that their food usually tastes fresh.  None of their entrees has ever really ""wowed"" me... except for their cheesecake.  If you go there, you can expect a good meal (but not great) served in a gigantic portion that will almost ensure you will be leaving with leftovers. I will come back and edit this review when I realize exactly why I've never really liked The Cheesecake Factory.  Could be the lack of originality, could be the fact that almost everything on their menu is between 1000 and 2000 calories, or it could just be the fake-feeling atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=120

When I eat at chains, it's because I have a general idea that the food is going to be decent, and the service will be good. 1 out of 2 this time. My food was 'edible', but nothing that would actually cause you to 'enjoy' your meal. I probably could have sent it back, but I had no hope that the next plate would be any better, and I was 'over' being at Cheesecake Factory.  I hadn't eaten at this one in many years, but the other two I had visited (Plaza, and in Columbus OH) were much better than I had expected, so I had expectations that this one would be good. This visit was 80% less than the other recent visits elsewhere. The server was pretty good, and she kept my water filled, which is no small task.  Although she never did check on my meal satisfaction during the meal, when she cleared my plate, which had half my meal left on it, she showed concern, and offered to get me something else.  I declined, told her thanks, and asked for the check. Sometimes it's just a 'miss'.  Shortly thereafter, a nice young man (the manager, apparently....FT) was at my table, politely asking how my meal was.  I wasn't complaining, but I wasn't going to lie about it: ""Edible"". He asked what was wrong (entree was very tough, might have been overcooked, just....bleh).  He did everything he could to make my experience a good one, although I declined repeatedly.

It had sprinkles of shaved white chocolate on top of the cheesecake. I was expecting raspberries, but it had some kind of pureed raspberries instead. It had a chocolate crust with 2 huge dollops of whipped cream.  The taste was classic Cheesecake Factory.

I had the Thai lettuce wraps and enjoyed them.   The veggies and lettuce were very fresh and the chicken was hot and juicy.  Three little sauces gave me lots to play with, and I do like sauces!   One of my lunch companions had the skinnylicious tacos and found them to be the perfect size.  Three soft shell tacos with a small bowl of Spanish rice as a side.  It was almost like they realized that people might like to eat here and actually have a little room left for a slice of cheesecake!  Another lunch companion had the meatloaf and said his wife makes one that is tastier.  Nevertheless he gave it a passing grade.  Our 4th person had a cheese pizza... we teased her a little but she insisted.  I had a slice and found that for a basic cheese pizza it actually had quite a lot of flavor.  Surprise! My slice of turtle cheesecake was boxed to go, and this evening when I enjoyed it with my husband (trust me there's plenty to share!) we both were grinning ear to ear like children on Christmas.  Yum!   It's a special once-every-now-and-then indulgence.  Do try the Cheesecake, ANY cheesecake, they certainly do it right.  Be cautious on your expectations of the food though...it's good but not stellar.  Were it not for the fun decor and the great service I might had downgraded this to a 3 star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=60

You can see how well this strategy has worked for Houlihan's. The menu is a page after laminated page of soulless beige dishes. Nearly all of their signature dishes are chicken unless you added some shrimp. Portions used to be enough for three meals. Not anymore. This is a one setting dish now. This place isn't cheap.

When I got home (15 min drive) the food was already cold, not luke warm but COLD. I question whether it actually took 20 mins to make since they were fried eggrolls. I use to eat at this place once a week but I got tired of the bad service. Its been a year and it looks like nothing has changed.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park

Everything else is pretty uninspired.  On my last visit, my chicken-mango-avocado salad featured little chunks of rock-hard underripe mango, an overcooked stringy piece of chicken, and a vinaigrette that was so tart it was actually painful to eat.  They also told us that the first part of our party hadn't arrived, just before we spotted them sitting at a large table.  (They don't take reservations, so you have to send advance scouts for a large lunch group.)  Service at lunch was painfully slow & disorganized.  Not in a hurry to go back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park

Our server was really nice, very attentive, answered all of our questions, and brought us a little hot fudge sundae to celebrate. The food was good, but not fantastic.

Bryenn L.,"Kansas City, United States",48,92,276,4.0,10/6/2016,"I prefer this location over the plaza location, especially for weekend dinners (the wait is out the door on the plaza then).  I've always had a pleasant experience here and the marble interior with high-ceiling and pillars are a nice touch.  They have their lunch specials every day until 5 p.m. I will say, the menu reads like a chapter book with ads separating the genres of food they offer. So if you're indecisive, tell the waiter you'll need more than a minute. On top of that, they have plenty of awesome dishes to choose from, which doesn't make the process any easier.  I've found that all the pastas, have had them all, are fantastic. My favorite pasta is the Carbonara and Da Vinci.  If you're feeling adventurous, you can have your dessert before your meal. As you walk into the place, they have their cheesecake bar on the right side, before you're greeted by their front-end staff. My favorite cheesecake they offer, currently have 60+ cheesecake flavors and always adding/substituting, is the Banana Cheesecake. It's a cheesecake with a hint of banana flavor with whip cream and fresh bananas cut on top of the cream. So good. If you don't see your favorite cheesecake on there anymore, you should ask to see if they still offer it.  For the quality of the food and immense choices, the price is very reasonable.

M. O.,"Overland Park, United States",80,174,296,3.0,12/2/2016,"Being from a small(er) town, I recall my early experiences with Cheesecake Factory being a BIG DEAL.  When my wife (then-girlfriend) moved to Kansas City from the aforementioned village, nearly every big experience was celebrated with a dinner date out to the Cheesecake Factory on the Country Club Plaza in The Big City.  We gladly suffered through three-hour-and-thirty-minute waits on Saturday night, just to be ""on the Plaza"" and seemingly more awesome than all the pitiful fools we left behind from our misspent (mis-located?) youth. The basics haven't changed in 10 years - nice, clean venues, consistent decor, strong service, enormous menu covering cuisine from all seven continents, and, yes, hunger-pain-inducing long waits on the weekends. My last three visits have all been relatively more of the same, with the exception that each one missed a step in one of the above areas.  On the former two occasions, the food quality had seemingly dropped off a tick. For a decade, I would have rated it 4/5 stars, but it's dropped to 3 - 3.5.  Still strong, especially considering the breadth of menu options the obviously-skilled CF chefs have to be able to create, but down a notch.  Quantity is still enormous, which is to say just fine. On my latest visit, I feel we were slighted on the usual above-average service end of things.  Our waitress was a little more in tune to the pompadour-haired bartender than her waiting duties, both on our table and others'.  You may be thinking, ""But, M.O., you yourself pointed out just how crazy-busy the Cheesecake Factory is!""  Yes, Yelp brethren, while this is normally true, on this occasion it was a mid-winter Thursday evening from 9:00 to 11:00 pm in the bar.  We were but one of three spots in the entire bar area taking up space.  So few tables to tend to should have meant better-than-average service, however we received the opposite.  Nitpicks aside, Cheesecake Factory remains a strong, albeit predictable, choice for a good meal alongside half the metropolitan area.   TIP: Get the cheesecake. Any of them. Obvious, yes, but almost so much so that you might be tempted to eat that entire 14-pound plate of delicious pasta instead of leaving room for dessert.  There's a reason the dessert name made the façade, folks!

The place is always busy. Let's face it. Always. This place turns over some insane amount of business. We walked in, and were not at all surprised to find ourselves a 10-15 minute wait. No biggie. We were given a little light up thing, and told to wait. The wait actually was pretty quick before it light up and began vibrating, telling us it was time to sit. We went back to the host stand, they took our light up thing, and then.... We waited. They lost our table (?) - they forgot who we were (?) - we waited almost 10 more minutes, before they finally asked ""What was the name? It'll be a 10-15 minute wait."" Uh... yea, no. I informed them we had waited, and already turned in our light up thing that should have gotten us a coveted seat at the wonderous Factory a la Cheesecake. They did find a table for us. A table, towards a corner of the restaurant, that sat exactly 2 people, and the table left little room for 2 waters, let alone food or bread. But, it was a table. The waitress took about 10 minutes to come to us with waters, another 10 to bring the drinks we ordered.. and the food. Sigh. Mom ordered an omlette - eggs people. 10 minute cook time, max.. I ordered a salad - the tuna tataki salad - RAW... and still, our food took 47 minutes to arrive to our table. I had watched another couple who came in after us, were seated after us, order drinks, an appetizer, their entrees, and 4 slices of cheese cake to go, and they were out.. before we even received our food. The waitress wasn't necessarily a bad server. She was friendly, and kept a smile on her face, even knowing how frustrated we were with the incredibly long wait, and ticket times.

I probably could have sent it back, but I had no hope that the next plate would be any better, and I was 'over' being at Cheesecake Factory.  I hadn't eaten at this one in many years, but the other two I had visited (Plaza, and in Columbus OH) were much better than I had expected, so I had expectations that this one would be good. This visit was 80% less than the other recent visits elsewhere. The server was pretty good, and she kept my water filled, which is no small task.  Although she never did check on my meal satisfaction during the meal, when she cleared my plate, which had half my meal left on it, she showed concern, and offered to get me something else.  I declined, told her thanks, and asked for the check. Sometimes it's just a 'miss'.  Shortly thereafter, a nice young man (the manager, apparently....FT) was at my table, politely asking how my meal was.  I wasn't complaining, but I wasn't going to lie about it: ""Edible"".

It had a chocolate crust with 2 huge dollops of whipped cream.  The taste was classic Cheesecake Factory. I realize I can get these at Sam's Club at any time, but something is kind of cool about half price cheesecake day. But if they priced the cheesecake affordably in the first place,  we could enjoy it any time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=60

It was really cold inside as well, I understand it's cold outside but when the majority of the guests still have their coats on while eating that's a little ridiculous. The host was very nice did a great greet and the manager was very nice as well when she cleared some plates from the table. However; the server was not so great. She walked past us several times when we had empty plates and empty drinks. We also needed boxes when we pushed our plates to the edge of the table and she had walked past us again. Didn't really upsale or recommend anything and we basically had to ask her if we could have dessert and hot tea.

Dawn C.,"Overland Park, United States",110,345,118,4.0,30/5/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet when going with a group since the menu is so huge that everyone is sure to find at least one thing to tempt them.  The downside for me has always been twofold: too many things offered with nothing really spectacular and the crazy calorie load of almost every single item.  I decided to give this place a 4th star today in honor of their new ""skinnylicious"" menu!  Hooray!  It's about time you could enjoy a nice lunch here for less than 2000 calories.  I had the Thai lettuce wraps and enjoyed them.   The veggies and lettuce were very fresh and the chicken was hot and juicy.  Three little sauces gave me lots to play with, and I do like sauces!   One of my lunch companions had the skinnylicious tacos and found them to be the perfect size.  Three soft shell tacos with a small bowl of Spanish rice as a side.  It was almost like they realized that people might like to eat here and actually have a little room left for a slice of cheesecake!  Another lunch companion had the meatloaf and said his wife makes one that is tastier.  Nevertheless he gave it a passing grade.  Our 4th person had a cheese pizza... we teased her a little but she insisted.  I had a slice and found that for a basic cheese pizza it actually had quite a lot of flavor.  Surprise! My slice of turtle cheesecake was boxed to go, and this evening when I enjoyed it with my husband (trust me there's plenty to share!) we both were grinning ear to ear like children on Christmas.  Yum!   It's a special once-every-now-and-then indulgence.  Do try the Cheesecake, ANY cheesecake, they certainly do it right.  Be cautious on your expectations of the food though...it's good but not stellar.  Were it not for the fun decor and the great service I might had downgraded this to a 3 star review.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=60

Samantha M.,"Belton, United States",8,56,,3.0,1/8/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory, king of the chain restaurants. The one thing I like about chain restaurants is that I can rely on items being available (I honestly think that's what their high points are, you know what the expect).  With that said, I went to The Cheesecake Factory Saturday afternoon because it was National Cheesecake Day. I am not one to ignore such a day so I decided to stop by and pick up a slice of cheesecake (the deal they had going was half off a slice of cheesecake/1 per customer).  I decided to go to the bakery counter and get my cheesecake to-go. The girl taking my order was extremely sweet and patient as I decided exactly which cheesecake I wanted to try. I went for the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake....let me tell you it was the most divine piece of cheesecake I have had in a long time. It has a macaroon type crust, tons of coconut and chocolate chunks throughout the cake. I of course could only eat half of it and left the other half for later (I can never finish a slice of cheesecake). So if you're a fan of coconut cream I highly recommend this cheesecake and for those that are rolling their eyes saying ""why don't you just make your own cheesecake instead of supporting a chain"" my answer to you is, if you'd like to spend the $50+ for the ingredients for the cheesecake I make (real honest to goodness NY cheesecake) then by all means please send me a check or money order :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=120

YES!   this afternoon i lunched on the patio and ordered the balsamic house salad. WOW was it good and i'm really not a dressing fan. i had my standard tex mex eggrolls which were excellent and also a banana cream cheesecake to go.  it was a gorgeous afternoon and i couldnt really think of a better lunch out reading on thier patio.  they have a ton of new dishes through the new menu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=120
The Zen Chef N.,"Wichita, United States",0,31,,2.0,24/5/2014,"We love visiting KC, and one of my fav restaurants to revisit is the Cheesecake Factory. But it seems like every revisit, the place seems to have gone downhill on service. Maybe there's better competition based on new experiences elsewhere. We had a birthday in the family, and was eager to have a great enjoyable dinner. We waited about 1 hr for our table, reason was big party of 8. Hence, we see parties of 9-10s that came after us that got seated before us. Then finally, we get a table and the server tells us all the fresh fish is out, even not your frozen cod or whatever fish they use for fish n chips is out. Then after talking to the manager, all of a sudden the delivery truck just delivered fresh fish on a Sunday evening, after we already ordered. Needless to say the food was okay, wasn't worth it all that wait and scarce menu options. Dissappointing to say the least, maybe they should just stick to desserts.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=120
Brad C.,"Overland Park, United States",2,25,,3.0,12/9/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is very much a love/hate type of restaurant.  I think it lies somewhere in between a VERY upscale Applebee's and the type of mega-sized gourmet restaurant you would see in a Vegas casino. They get points for their diverse menu selection (the menu is a 10+ page book!) and that their food usually tastes fresh.  None of their entrees has ever really ""wowed"" me... except for their cheesecake.  If you go there, you can expect a good meal (but not great) served in a gigantic portion that will almost ensure you will be leaving with leftovers. I will come back and edit this review when I realize exactly why I've never really liked The Cheesecake Factory.  Could be the lack of originality, could be the fact that almost everything on their menu is between 1000 and 2000 calories, or it could just be the fake-feeling atmosphere.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=120

Called a few days ahead of time to make sure we could all get seated within a reasonable amount of time after my guests arrived. ""We don't take reservations, but come an hour early,"" the hostess said, ""and if someone if here for your party the whole time, we will have you ready to go come 6:30."" So, I dropped my husband off an hour early and left to run some errands, only to get a phone call from him minutes later saying that our name is on the list but they don't need us to be there. So I turned around to get him but stayed behind just in case. Long story short - my whole party had arrived by 6:30 but we stood in a poorly lit foyer for another 30 minutes before they would seat us. And not even seat us all - though when we got there the hostess admitted that one of our 5 tables wasn't ready yet so some of my guests would have to stand while we physically waited for a table of two to get the hint that they had been there too long. My husband finally had the nerve that the staff didn't and to asked the couple to leave. I love Cheesecake Factory. I LOVE it. However, I was pretty bummed that we were given the short end of the stick considering that we were worth 10 of those tables of two.

Tossed with Vinaigrette), grilled artichoke, and split a flatbread (Garlic, Shallots and Fresh Herbs) with my friend.  Everything was good.  I least enjoyed the faro salad, next time I think I'd order the mediterranean salad  which has the same flavors minus the faro.  The artichoke was boiled to cook it and then grilled, which gave it a nice smokey flavor.  It was served with a balsamic vinaigrette instead of the traditional butter aioli, which was ok.  Loved the flatbread, but even with two other dishes, I do not recommend sharing at as you will want all six incredibly small pieces for yourself.  My total bill was $23 before tip= AWESOME!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100

We were there to celebrate a birthday, and I feel bad for my sister in law that she had to endure that as her birthday dinner.  Let me say that the food was fine, other than a very room temperature and soggy salad for my husband. Our waitress, Tanya, was so unfriendly that it was strange. She had to be asked several times for water, kids menus, and drink refills, which we had to flag her down to get. She never checked on us unless someone was waving their arms. She left salad plates and bread plates on the table that was small to begin with, so that my husband finally moved them to a bussing station himself so as not to elbow one to the floor.  What should have been a decent experience was just plain uncomfortable. We were all very frustrated, by the end of dinner, and she took so long to come back, that we left without dessert, which was kind of the part some of us were most looking forward to.

After looking through the 30 page menu for a good ten minutes, I decided upon the ahi tuna tatiki salad. A few minutes after my waiter took my order, he returned to tell me that they had run out of the ingredients and I would have to choose another dish. No biggie, so I restarted the arduous task of searching through the menu. I decided on a separate pasta dish, but the price was upscaled $5 from the salad I was intending on getting, so I asked my waiter if given the mishap he would be able to discount the difference to make up for it. He said he'd take care of it so I went on with my meal satisfied. Lo and behold, when the check rolled around, no discount had been added. I pointed this out to my waiter and he left for what seemed like thirty minutes to go discuss it with his manager. When he came back he regrettably told me they could not discount the dish, but would be willing to offer me half-off a dessert. I told the waiter I was not interested in dessert and he said there was nothing else they could do, so I took my own discount out of the waiter's tip. It's a shame because the waiter himself was friendly and accommodating, but the management's incessant attempts to nickel and dime their customers is appalling and has driven away a consistent diner tonight.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100

I ordered Miso Salmon.  To my surprise, it was a decent dish.  The fish wasn't over-powered by the glaze and I quite enjoyed the white sauce that surrounded my bed of rice.  I believe the description said it was a miso sauce, but I didn't taste a hint of miso in it.  It really tasted like a beurre blanc.  The snow peas were nice and crisp, though I'd wished there were more than five.  I will say that the salmon was slightly overcooked in one area, which was a turn-off, but I let it slide since they aren't exactly known for their seafood.  Also, there was a disproportionately large amount of rice compared to the size of the fish atop it, and it was some cheap, sad variety of poorly-cooked sogginess.  My friend had a chicken salad sandwich.  She said it was good, but I didn't sample it, as I don't see the appeal in any such entree. Our service was extremely slow, but the server was friendly enough.  Besides, we were there to chatter away and we overstayed our welcome by an hour (not during peak hours, it was after the lunch rush...I'm not rude).  This place is really overpriced for what they have to offer, but at least they have a variety of options.  And the entree I had last week makes me feel better about my inevitable next visit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=100

We had called ahead of time and asked for a reservation and when we got there at the time they told us, they said it was going to be another 45-60 minute wait. We were starving and decided to wait in the lobby. The floor manager wasn't very polite, I understand we were a bunch of students waiting, and we did crowd the lobby a little but she did not have to treat us with such disgust. We didn't mind though, what really set me off was when an elderly man had walked in with his wife, he had made a reservation too,  and she said ""you will have to wait, we accidentally have given your table to someone else"". What is the point of making reservations if you won't even get the table?  To pass the time, some of us went to the whole foods and explored the area. When we came back, we were finally seated but it was so crowded! We were seated in next to the booths. For drinks we had Ordered ""house made lemonade"". The rims of the glasses were coated with sugar and it was very sweet. It tasted like all the flavoring was at the bottom of the glass and the top was water. I had ordered the chicken farfalle pasta. Now originally it comes with pacetta and mushrooms, but I do not eat pork or beef and I hate mushrooms, so I asked if I could have it without them. It took about 20-30 minutes before the food came, we had bread and butter at our table. When we finally got our food, I dug straight in. I first noticed that there were mushrooms in it, i disregarded it. But then as I took and bite, I tasted something strange. They had put pork in my pasta. I immediately started crying and freaking out, considering its against my religion to eat pork, I had gotten the manager, I was teary eyed ,and she brushed me off and called the waitress. I do not think they understood how upset I was. The waitress sent it back. In 10 minutes I had gotten the replacement, however it did not have the same saucy texture and it was piping hot. The food looked okay but my appetite was gone. My friend said however, it was not the best. Considering how over priced it is, the service and the food, we should have went to Olive Garden.

My thought is if they was cooking orders together this would have had been figured out well before that steak had time to cook. We came together, to eat together, and drink together.

Summer C.,"Bentonville, United States",995,1008,3062,5.0,8/4/2015,"I just feel like it is hard to go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. There are so many options, your whole party will find something to eat. I've never had a bad experience with any of the dishes I have ordered at the Cheesecake Factory.  My family and I made a weekend trip to Kansas City and we came here. We knew we wanted to come here, since we use to live in CA near a few cheesecake factories and then moved to AR with no cheesecake factories. We were really excited to come eat! WAIT/PARKING: We came on a Saturday evening around 6ish. It was really crowded, but we didn't have too long of a wait fortunately. About 30 minutes.  The restaurant is located in a small shopping center. There is a decent amount of parking, but it is a busy restaurant, so parking can be hard to find. We had to park near Whole Foods, which is in the back of cheesecake - not far. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Our waiter gave us great customer service. Very friendly and helpful. FOOD: I've ordered quite a few dishes at Cheesecake Factory. Lately, I've mainly been ordering off of the skinnylicious menu. Can't beat yummy and healthy! I've had several items off of this menu and they have all been delicious and filling. This trip I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad. So yummy, ate it all! It was a large portion too. Which, btw, all of cheesecake factory dishes are good size portions. Usually you will have left overs.  My husband ordered the Italian Sandwich and loved it.  We had our 2 year old daughter with us. At all restaurant locations they bring out a smaller plate of fruit and bread to you if you have a small child. Not sure whicha age is the cut off for that. It is such a nice gesture and I appreciate them taking that extra step to treat the kids good and help the parents out ;). Then we ordered cheesecake... I mean c'mon, how can you pass it up when dining here! I've had a good amount of cheesecakes here and they are all yummy. This time I ordered the Hershey's Cheesecake - oh my yum! My husband had the Reese's Peanut Buttercup Chocolate Cheesecake- also very delicious. We had leftovers from our cheesecakes. Very delicious, but both rich that we weren't able to finish them. However, I finished mine later for my ""4th"" meal haha.  Other cheesecakes I love: fresh strawberry, s'more, 30th anniversary, godiva, raspberry, peanut butter cup fudge, and chocolate mousse. I also love the linda's fudge cake and lemoncello cream torte.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20
Catherine H.,"Excelsior Springs, United States",3,9,3,1.0,12/3/2017,"Watch your bill here!!!!!  Waitress brought me wrong credit card receipt to sign.  When I caught it,  no apology.  It is a scam that is running at this restaurant.  If it had been a mistake, most restaurants offer a free dessert or something.  They have a very smooth scam going here.  Beware!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20
Lauren H.,"Olathe, United States",44,25,,4.0,13/8/2016,"First: we had a great waiter the other day. He was friendly, respectful, and suggested his favorite blend of tea. My mom loves tea more than most people can conceptualize, and she was very impressed. She requested that I add this review.  Second: Oh, Cheesecake Factory. If only I could live my dreams and eat your cheesecake for breakfast everyday. There's nothing like rolling out of bed and enjoying a slice of key lime cheesecake while dancing in your kitchen, preferably at the counter closest to your refrigerator. It's divine. You've been there to celebrate birthdays, births, divorces, and everything in between. You remain a constant. I'm sure this is the new Red Lobster of single 20-30 something females, but you never judge. Keep that brown bread and cheesecake coming, and everything will be just fine.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20

Michelle L.,"Philadelphia, United States",0,4,,4.0,27/11/2016,"Being a fan of the ahi tuna, I ordered the small plate. It was very savory and did not disappoint. I would however be cautious about ordering appetizers. The Firecracker Salmon only cost a little less than an entree, but what I got was a large plate, half of which was covered in red cabbage, the other half with 4 wimpy little spring rolls swimming in sauce. Scarcely more than a bite each for a party of 4.  The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was delicious, though the amount of chicken and shrimp seems to be have decreased somewhat. Louisiana Chicken Pasta was ordered from the lunch special, and was also quite good and not overly salty! Definitely don't come here if you're calorie conscious. However Cheesecake Factory as a chain has consistent quality to its dishes.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20
Jamie A.,"Lawrence, United States",1,33,85,4.0,12/10/2016,4.5 stars. Going to the Cheesecake Factory is always a treat. Best Fettuccine Alfredo I've had in months! I got the Snickers Bar Chunks & Cheesecake and ate every bite. The fried macaroni and cheese is a great appetizer.

Emily B.,"Olathe, United States",0,10,,3.0,7/8/2016,"Had lunch there today, it was alright.  My husband and I noticed that the knives, a napkin, and one of the appetizer plates on the table were obviously filthy, so we had to ask for clean replacements right off the bat when we sat down. A short note - they have tons of dishes to choose from, so unless you're a regular or you absolutely love a very specific dish, be prepared to search through a huge (approx. 20 pages) menu. We ordered the (pork?) potsticker dumplings; those were pretty good.  I ordered their 'Factory Burger' for my main meal, and quite frankly, I was disappointed with what I got.  The bread was hard and tough to bite through (unlike the appetizer bread), the onions on the bottom were sort of sad-looking, and while the meat was cooked as ordered, the meal itself didn't come out very hot (unlike the plate).  In hindsight, I should've ordered what my husband had, the 'Bacon-Bacon' burger.  That looked a lot more satisfactory, to be honest. The portion sizes are pretty big, so if you choose to order dessert afterwards, I suggest you get it to-go.  I ordered the Mango Key Lime cheesecake, which tasted lovely (but I do wish they'd cut back on the coconut a little bit).  However, for what it's worth, the prices for just about everything on the menu are...too pricey.  An appetizer (some running about $7-$9) here could get you an -entire meal- elsewhere. As far as service goes, it was decent.  Nothing particularly outstanding or terrible. In short, avoid the 'Factory Burger', it's a total rip-off.  As a whole, the restaurant is a nice treat...once in a while, when you've got the -extra money- to splurge.  It's on the (much?) more expensive end for casual restaurants.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20
Dianne P.,"Lee's Summit, United States",2,10,,5.0,27/4/2017,Cheesecake Factory never fails to satisfy.  You will always find something to suit your craving.  Their Skinnylicious menu is wonderful!  And I've never had a dessert that wasn't fabulous!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20
James M.,"Overland Park, United States",8,106,8,3.0,12/1/2017,I DO NOT get it?! People love this place! No clue why people love it. It is OK but not great. I guess if you are rating on cheesecake maybe?! Giant menu that is really just chicken done 50 different ways. This may just be me but I am not going out to eat chicken breast I can do that at home. Most people like this place I think its average at best. Priced too high for what it is but that location and building jack the price up lol! People will probably all not agree with me so sorry,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20
Richard C.,"Saint Joseph, United States",23,3,,2.0,28/3/2017,Terribly small chicken enchiladas. The red sauce tasted like burnt barbecue. The beans and rice was good. I left the restaurant hungry. I won't order that plate again.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=20

Only one worker who was taking orders on the phone, taking orders for cheesecakes and supposedly checking out the to go orders. The manager was talking to a co-worker about the cheesecake container for to go orders. Took 10 minutes for someone to come and help take care of the customers.

Lea K.,"Overland Park, United States",21,107,,3.0,12/8/2010,"If I were to review based only on deserts this place would get 5 stars hands down, no question. Though the menu is huge the vegetarian options are disappointing. They have quite a few dinner salads yet all of them have meat. Though I can order it without the chicken, it bothers me to pay $13 for a salad when I am not getting the meat. The salads should have two prices a price without meat, then an option to add meat for an additional charge. By doing this the vegetarians won't feel 'ripped off'.  I tried the portabella mushroom sandwich. The portabella had a tough skin and wasn't enjoyable at all. The grilled cheese is very good but with a menu like their I shouldn't have to order a grilled cheese. I usually order the Chicken Thai lettuce wraps and sub avocado for the chicken. They are wonderful that way. My main suggestion for the Cheesecake factory is to add tofu to their options. That way, vegetarians can sub the tofu for meat. That would open up the menu greatly.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=140
Tara P.,"Oakland, United States",194,63,99,3.0,29/11/2008,"I don't venture to The Cheesecake Factory often and each time I do actually go, I remind myself why.  The service is fair to poor.  I hate to generalize their wait staff in that way, but the last waiter I had confirmed my feelings about that.  We had several people waiting on our medium sized party (7) and I never truly knew who our waiter was.  We were left to view our menu's for WAY too long.  You would think that they woud get the hint when the conversation at the table turned to, ""Where did our waiter go? and He has been gone so long I have forgotten what he/she looked like.""  Despite the service, the food was good.  I had the lunch salad and pizza.  The salad was big enough to eat by itself, so at least I got another meal out of the pizza.  If you like Starbucks iced green tea, their Sweetened Green Tea is great here too!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=140
Justin E.,"Raytown, United States",133,273,32,3.0,27/7/2008,Way overpriced for the quality. I don't think I've waited less then 30mins to be seated during dinner time. I really luv their fish taco's (even if I am paying too much for them) but they are the best/freshest in town. Anytime I've ordered Beef or a Red Meat item off the menu I've ended up shitting in my pants on the drive home. I don't know what the chef cooks the meat it but my body doesn't like it. Maybe MSG (man sausage good),https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-overland-park?start=140
