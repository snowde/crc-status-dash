Wesley M.,"Jersey City, NJ",251,312,6,2.0,1/5/2014,"This restaurant is majestic and the servers are friendly. This are the only two reasons this place even gets stars. I was really excited for my first experience, but was let down in service and food. The only redeeming quality was that the prices were reasonable and the calamari was good and came out quickly. Otherwise the food and beverages took forever. I had the chicken Madeira as my entree, which is keyed add their most popular dish. It sounds good on paper - chicken breast topped with mushrooms, mozzarella, and asparagus with mashed potatoes on the side. But in reality it was just packed with salt and no real flavor.  Florida is packed with food chains and there are a lot so I probably won't be returning here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=40

Lolly A.,"Kearny, NJ",101,24,4,3.0,1/27/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain known for its large menu and large portions. They have food for all tastes and it's great for sharing with pals. There's always a wait to get inside on the weekends even though you have many seating options including : inside (booths, high tops, bar seating, tables) outside (traditional tables on a covered patio, or along the sides of the facility without head covering.)  The hostess staff are very nice people and they give very accurate ETA for seating. This is great if you're catching a movie within the next hour and may not be able to stay for the duration.  I've always enjoyed the factory burger, factory burrito and the drinks. The drawback : the place is expensive, like really, really expensive. My boyfriend and I ordered two factory burgers and two drinks - $65 bill. My eyes almost fell out of my face when I saw the total. They do not print pricing for beverages and one of the drinks was $17. One drink. $17. It was a great drink, but holy moly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=40

Deb M.,"Jupiter, FL",29,21,34,4.0,2/17/2015,"Went with the whole family and everyone enjoyed their meals. We did notice the ""dinner"" size portion was smaller than what we were used to receiving for The Cajun pasta dish. Loaded baked potato soup was tasty, a bit heavy on the bacon but overall very good. Tried the buffalo bites which were surprisingly large for being named bites. Very yummy though, hot wing sauce and cheese on the inside of long fried chicken triangle strip like things.

Then a couple who are of a different persuasion came and sat down 20 min after we did and they were served drinks right away.

When we arrived, we called the restaurant and told them we were outside waiting at one of their designated curbside/to go parking spots. The server came out and met us and delivered our food to us while we sat in the car.  We paid and then left!  What a genius idea! Unfortunately the food was only okay.  I had the shrimp bistro pasta which is usually one of my favorite dishes but the batter on the shrimp was too much and it was fried in clumps instead of individually spread out across my pasta.  The peanut butter cup cake was delicious though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=40

Adam S.,"Charlotte, NC",15,361,3,4.0,1/21/2012,"Cheesecake is really what you make of it. It can be delicious, such as my half Steak Dianne and half salmon, or fattening and heavy, like my dad's pasta. We ordered guacamole to start, and it was absolutely delicious, I must have had half of the chips alone. Salsa was also very good and mild (you can choose if you want it mild or spicy). In serving our meals, one od the servers (not our guy) actually whacked my mom on the head with her elbow and did not apologize. That's very unacceptable. My meal was half of the lemon salmon and half of Steak Dianne and some mashed. The steak was delicious, and the sauce had bitter and sweet notes. The salmon was above average, I just wished there was a little more crunch on the outside. My dad's fettucini was heavy and he didn't eat much of it, which doesn't happen a lot. My mom and sister also got pasta, which they reported was very good. Cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory is always good, however I didn't love the Reese's, so I might just stick to Red Velvet next time. Service was good, the friendly waiter talked to my dad about SUNY.

This location does not even come close to meeting standards I've come to know Cheesecake Factory for. Tonight, my husband and I did not receive our dinner after _50_ minutes of waiting. Even at the 30 minute mark when we asked about the status of our order, we still waited 10 more minutes without being served, and then asked for a manager.

Three months ago, I never even received water or met our server to put in a drink order until 10+ minutes passed and I had to ask for assistance. That evening, our dinner order was significantly delayed and I had to ask for the manager to get involved.

Since our server Kristen noticed I had birthday card and present she knew it was my birthday we were too full for dessert but she still brought over a little ice cream with whipped cream and sprinkles and a candle and said happy birthday because she knew we didn't like singing I thought that was very kind of her and very nice and I highly recommend Kristen and I think she should get a raise!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens

Alana E.,"Boynton Beach, FL",110,111,35,2.0,11/11/2017,"I'm not a huge fan of CF to begin with, I think the menu is overwhelming and food not that great, but every once and a while I go because others want to. So today we got there and had to wait 10 or 15 minutes for a nearly empty restaurant. So we sit down and look at the crazy bible menu, which to me has a whole lot of nothing. I decided on the goat salad, which I've had before and my mom got the warm crab dip. Mine comes out and I swore in the past it had fried goat cheese, but this time it didn't. No worries there mine was good I can't complain. My mom, however, took a bite of her bread and it was literally rock hard and the crab dip was just gross. So we signaled the waitress who came over begrudgingly and asked her if she wanted chips, instead. She sent it back because it literally tasted horrendous and ordered the spinach artichoke dip. So in the interim we are given butter and no bread. Finally, the spin dip comes out and it was good, but you can tell we pissed the waitress off because we got attitude central after we sent her food back. Then I looked at the spin dip plate and there's green stuff on it that in no way represents our order (see pic). Kinda gross, I'm hoping it was just food that rubbed off on the plate and not a dirty plate. Then we waited another half hour before we got the check. In other news, I don't know why I don't learn my lesson, I don't understand the hype except unhealthy people eat here for the quantity, not the quality. And don't even get me started on the service.

Krishna N.,"Riviera Beach, FL",248,73,173,4.0,5/7/2017,"This place is always a hit or miss. Sometimes the food is like wow, this is the best meal ever and other times it's like we'll wish it was better. There's been a few times when I ordered the steak Diane where I was overly impressed with how the sauce was made and other times where I asked for medium well steak and they gave me pretty much medium rare and I've sent it back. That fish for sure has been a hit or miss.  The buffalo ranch chicken salad is amazing. My favorite salad there to order for sure. The salads are so huge here. Ask for dressing on the side though sometimes they drench the salad a little too much for me. But if you like dressing overload then ask for it to be tossed into the salad. The happy hour for food is really good. The food is so cheap and they give you so much for being happy hour. The drinks are nothing special though. My favorite item is the crab wontons they give you ten of them. I like that they have the calorie count next to the food. Some people may not like it but for me it's helpful. I also like to order the Greek salad. My favorite happy hour salad. Big enough to be filling.  Overall I think you have to try this cheesecake location. It's not the best one but it's good enough. You may get that amazing dish that one day so it's worth a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens
Vanessa B.,"Windermere, FL",294,153,203,3.0,5/23/2016,"I was meeting up with my family for my father's birthday, and we thought this Cheesecake Factory location would be more convenient.  We're no strangers to Cheesecake Factory - most of our family get togethers involve a meal out at Cheesecake Factory. Normally, we go to the Boca Raton location. FOOD (3.5/5): The bread was a little on the tough side - as if it sat too long in the bread warmer.  We ordered some calamari, which we usually love from Cheesecake.  However, the breading fell off easily, and there were so many pieces stuck together that it made it difficult to share without tearing the pieces apart.  I also feel like the portion size was smaller.  I ordered the lunch salad, soup, and turkey sandwich combo.  The soup of the day, cream of chicken, was rather runny and watery for my taste.  The sandwich bread was really soggy, and I'm not sure why.  My brother and father each ordered the lunch orange chicken, which seemed more like the batter than the actual chicken.   SERVICE (4/5): I waited at the hostess stand for a few minutes before anyone greeted me.  While the hostess was busy on the phone, there were other servers who were just standing around.  Eventually, someone asked me if I needed to put a name on the wait list.  Our server was pretty good.   ATMOSPHERE (3/5):  It was pretty loud in the restaurant.  However, it is very well lit (at least in the afternoon - I can't speak about lighting in the evening).  The decor reminds me of Grand Lux Cafe, which makes sense since Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux Cafe are sister restaurants.  Up front, they showcase their cheesecakes, which they are known for.  There's parallel parking on the street, or if you can't find street parking, a parking garage located very close to the restaurant.

Joe C.,"Canton, OH",50,10,1,2.0,12/26/2016,"Let me start out by saying that we love Cheesecake Factory. We don't go there often, so it's usually for a special occasion. This visit was for my daughter's 11th birthday with our Florida family. There were 11 of us altogether, with 7 adults, 1 teen, 2 tweens and 1 child.  We were seated relatively swiftly, no problems there. We placed our drink order, and no problems there either. We placed our order for appetizers and dinner and that's where things unfortunately went off the rails. Our 2 appetizers (corn tamales and spinach dip) arrived 3 minutes before our main meals. The waitress apologized but there was no clear reason why this happened. Needless to say, we were unable to enjoy the appetizers before the main meals came. Ok, irritating, but not horrible.  However, when the food arrived, my daughter started eating her macaroni and cheese burger with mashed potatoes. It seemed to be ok, but when she dug into the mashed potatoes and took a bite, there was a rotten potato there. Curious why there was a whole potato in ""mashed potatoes"" but nevertheless it was there. My daughter gagged and refused to eat any more of the potatoes. Honestly, it ruined her dinner. The manager was asked to come over and he did. He took my daughter's meal off our bill.  All in all, it was mostly a good visit and would have earned a higher rating, but the inexplicable food arrival time and rotten mashed potatoes definitely spoiled the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens

As always you can't go wrong with a piece of cheesecake they are all soooooo good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=20
Cristina W.,"Hollywood, FL",593,262,206,3.0,4/6/2016,"For starters, don't sit me in a dirty table and pass a rag to me to clean the table. To quote Cher Horowitz' famous two words: ""As If!""... Aside from that, the waiter was attentive and brought everything in a timely manner. The food is the same as other Cheesecake Factory locations and the decor is the same as well.  In a nice, downtown Palm Beach area, with a big parking garage. I will definitely return, IF, the table is cleaned before hand. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=20
Teri W.,"Leesburg, IN",0,12,20,5.0,3/20/2016,"Creamy, crunchy,  spicy!  Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. .. my favorite! Unfortunately, it doesn't come in a lunch size portion so I had no room for cheesecake.  We had a very attentive waiter.   Short wait time for our party of six.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=20
Joanne L.,"North Palm Beach, FL",16,75,155,4.0,7/29/2015,"Dinner with girls group before a 7pm movie. In and out without a worry as to time. Tasty light menu items at a reasonable price, and still room left for a slice of cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=20
Julie C.,"Royal Palm Beach, FL",15,17,8,5.0,11/16/2014,"Luau salad is bursting with flavor!!! I couldn't eat enough of it. Mango, peppers, wonton layers with veggies had me wanting to lick my fingers! Definitely a salad you need to eat with your hands instead of a fork.  The Bang Bang Chicken was good but not great. The curry tasted a little bland maybe in need of a kick of spice and a hint of salt. Sangria was good and service is always outstanding! So much that we bypass The Cheesecake Factory in City Place because this location is clean with service that is impeccable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=20
Melissa B.,"Brookfield, CT",51,91,13,4.0,5/26/2016,"Made a reservation for 6:15 and they usually stop reservations at 6:00 but they did it for my friend and I. We sat down outside right away and the server was great. We enjoyed fast drinks, ice tea and brought me equal as soon as I asked. We had to flatbread pizza's to share. Tomato and Mozzarella with the pears and pecan flatbread with blue cheese. They were both delicious but they did bring the bread out late. Then cappuccino's which were very good, we asked for extra cream... No problem. The best thing is they didn't rush us. I love restaurants that do not push you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=20
David B.,"Roslyn, NY",19,136,86,2.0,7/21/2016,At one time it was pretty good I would not go out of my way and for sure I would not wait in line to get in if you do go only thing I can recommend are the desserts the meals are mediocre you can get just as good at any diner,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=20
Lisa S.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",5,78,29,4.0,3/20/2016,"We go here an embarrassing amount since it's so close to the movies, but this chain is consistently good & with 10 pages of items to choose from not including their bazillion cheesecakes, why wouldn't you. It gets super busy on weekends & most evenings but it's a go to for our family. The only things we ever had that were not great were the bang bang shrimp (NOT at all like Bonefish) and the Margarita pizza (NOT a true margarita with no fresh ingredients & tasted like Dijourno). However, we've each all had many things here & go in groups and love everything else. Most items (including the cheesecake) should be split!! HUGE portions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=20
