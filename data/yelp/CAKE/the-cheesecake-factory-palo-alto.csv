Rosita A.,"Etobicoke, Canada",3,9,,3.0,12/27/2017,We like coming here because the food is good. But the service always feels very rushed at this location. It is also very loud and boisterous. Maybe not a bad thing. Also very expensive for what they give you.  A final point is how long it takes to get seated. It feels like begging. We can go next door to Crepevine and get better food for dinner and get a seat immediately.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto
Eric N.,"San Marcos, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"First of all, let me start off by saying that I LOVE Cheesecake Factory and have been to more than 15 locations. All of the ones that I've been to have pretty much had their stuff together and I can't say that I've ever had a really bad experience at any of them. However, this Cheesecake Factory was a whole different story. We walked in and the hosts and the people who were standing behind the Cheesecake counter were arguing with each other about something. Not a big deal, we thought. One of the hosts took us a a table and our server took our order. Then I started noticing that both the table to left and to the right of us were unhappy and asked our server to take some of the entrees back. Then one of our entrees came, the Shrimp Scampi, and it turned out to be very spicy. Now, I have ordered the Shrimp Scampi from Cheesecake Factory quite a few times and it is supposed to have a little kick to it but this one was drowned in red pepper. So, I told our server and asked to exchange it for a different pasta, and to my surprise, she just said okay and took it back. I wasn't expecting a big apology or anything like that, but the way she reacted and casually said ""okay"" made it seem like entrees coming out wrong is a very common occurrence here. Yikes! Later, we ended up ordering a cheesecake and she brought us a carrot cake instead, which I had to send back again! Throughout the entirety of the meal, I actually saw servers arguing with each other in plain view of customers (one server actually yelled ""ugh!"" and walked off). The food itself came out very slowly from the kitchen and honestly wasn't as good as other Cheesecake Factories. Lastly, when we were walking out, there were customers waiting to be seated but all 3 of the hosts were standing away from the counter and none of them attended to those customers. Finally, one of the girls from behind the Cheesecake counter walked over and yelled ""way to do your jobs, guys!"" at the Hosts and once again in plain view of customers!!!  Once again, I really do like Cheesecake Factory but it was incredibly surprising to see one function this poorly. Everyone from the Hosts, to the servers, to the kitchen didn't seem like they were very good at their jobs. Next time, I will probably be going to the location in Westfield Valley Fair rather than this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto
Nicole G.,"Union City, CA",183,316,470,2.0,12/26/2017,"Well I understand why this CCF is rated 2.5 stars. We came in 12/26 at 11am right when they open. Granted it's the day after Christmas so I understand people are still in holiday mode.  However, it was extremely slow and there were no other patrons until 11:30. We ordered our drinks at 11, bread came about 11:15. Then the wait. Our sever was nice and explained there was a large catering order that came in. I saw the GM walking around, he should've approached the tables and apologized for the delays.  When our food came at 11:40 (keep in mind it was just 2-3 other patrons) the flatbread came it was cold, took that back. The tamale corn cakes were cold too, but I was too hunger to wait. Thankfully the omelette was of temperature which came out 5 mins later. First and last time to this CCF Location.  Our waiter removed the coffee and soda as an apology which was greatly appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto
Emi N.,"San Carlos, CA",307,233,1844,3.0,12/8/2017,"Cheesecake Factory's are pretty much all the same.  Same menu, same ambiance, same cheesecakes.  I can't complain about the food.  Portions are ridiculously huge.  The last time I went to CF in Palo Alto, our drinks and bread didn't arrive for at least 30 minutes.  Not even water.   After I ordered my entree, our server came back to say they were out of it.  (This dish consisted of pasta, chicken and sauce).  I asked what part they were actually out of but she didn't know and went to find out.  When she came back she said it was the sauce and that she asked her manager if they could make something else but that she had to go back to let him know right away because he was already putting in the order.  Wait, what?  It made no sense to me that she would rush me like that without giving me more than a second to think about it.  I didn't even know what the order was!  I said I wanted to keep looking at the menu and she seemed kind of annoyed because obviously she had done me some sort of a favor.  Anyway, she asked what I wanted and I told her I was in the mood for pasta but that I didn't like cream sauces.  She then suggested the carbonara (which is pretty creamy)...   Long story short, I ordered another pasta and it was fine.  Maybe she was just having an off night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto

There was a piece of food on my knife. I didn't tell the waitress, just made sure I didn't use the knife. The food was way better at different locations, but after eating the bread and appetizer, I was already full. I asked the waitress if she can do something for me for my boyfriend's birthday.

I do not consider this a fault on Doordash's part. They obviously delivered what was handed to them by Cheesecake Factory. The problem is 100% on Cheesecake factory who has no quality control and think it is ok to deliver what was basically a cheese bread  for $7 and a lump of lettuce and greens for $12 . And now I need to reach out to them to get this sorted out instead of them proactively acting on it.

Rachel W.,"Redwood City, CA",237,226,380,2.0,11/20/2017,"*** 2.5 Stars ***  Only bumped up for our server - he was witty and Scottish sounding, and funny for our family lol. My mom doesn't have a sense of humor but whatever. Came here Friday night, to a 20 minute wait. Found a few seats in the bar, and then quickly got called to a table. They don't transfer tickets, which is inconvenient for patrons, but we settled it and then went to go eat. We ordered appetizers at the same time as an entree; guacamole (mild), shrimp spring rolls, beet and goat cheese salad, and the lemon garlic shrimp pasta. He didn't ask us whether we wanted appetizers first, but something happened in the kitchen anyway. We waited 20 minutes before our server even came back to check on us, and we had to inquire about our food. As soon as he walked away, other runners came out with everything. Okay, what is the purpose of an appetizer then? We dug in, and wow. If we were coming here for overpriced, over AND under-seasoned mediocre food, we hit the jackpot! The guacamole was INCREDIBLY salty. I've never had guacamole that salty in my life. There we also huge pieces of cilantro stalk, which made it a little cumbersome to even get a bite. We told the server about the guac and he took it back, and off the bill, but WOAH. I absolutely don't recommend ordering this. It's like, the easiest dish to prepare and get right! He told us that they prepare it in the morning, and that it may have gotten saltier over the day. Really? They make one giant batch in the morning for the whole day? And THEN it took 20 minutes to throw on a plate?  Then, the Lemon and Garlic Shrimp Pasta was flavorless. We had asked in advance if it was particularly garlicy and he said no, we'd taste the lemon over the garlic. Honestly, it tasted like nothing. Butter and parsley (which was the garnish). How lame! The shrimp spring rolls were ok - I found them on the dry side, and the peanut sauce wasn't much of a help, since it was on the blander side as well. My beet and goat cheese salad was more green apple than anything. There were 5 tiny chunks of beet on the whole plate. Boo you guys. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory at Oakridge Mall plenty of times - that's how it should be done. Sorry Palo Alto, will NOT be back. We obviously skipped dessert. ** Edit ** In response to the Cheesecake Factory's reply - we didn't feel we had to escalate to a manager, since we informed our server. He took the guacamole off the bill, and if he felt that manager intervention was needed, he should have said something to one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto

However once we were seated it seemed like they may have been short staffed. Our waiter was hard to find and our waters were not refilled until maybe an hour into the meal. Our food took a bit as well and my sister's salad had to be sent back, because it had tomatoes (when she asked for no tomatoes).

Karen K.,"San Francisco, CA",187,66,451,2.0,10/19/2017,"This review will primarily focus on the lack of quality in service at this particular location of this chain restaurant. If I were to rate the restaurant solely on its service (or lack thereof), I would be rating this location with one star. Not that the food was great--there was an onion peel (the very exterior layer) in the burrito. My waiter, Roger, was the only staff member I interacted with, so I am assessing this restaurant's service on the basis of his performance, assuming that the staff are trained to represent the chain well. The reason why I found myself at the Cheesecake Factory in the first place was because a friend of mine had been furiously craving an appetizer of deep-fried mac & cheese balls, and I was accompanying her. Turns out the only incentive (the mac & cheese balls) for us to be there in the first place was nonexistent--they had run out. (This was 6:30 pm.) After my friend expressed how bummed out she was, Roger explained that it was a popular item and asked her why she hadn't come earlier.  I see a problem in this question. I think that it's inevitable for a restaurant to be out of stock of certain items, but, personally, think it's unreasonable for a waiter to ask a diner why she didn't arrive earlier so that she could order this item, especially five hours before the restaurant's closing time. Roger offered an alternative--regular mac & cheese, and my friend ordered it, along with our other food orders. Allow me to note here that Roger was not writing anything down, but said, 'Yeah, I'll put that order in for you.' Later, after some other food items arrived, my friend asked Roger if her mac & cheese was on its way. Roger proceeded to deny that she had ordered the mac & cheese. He said, 'You never ordered that.'  I see two problems here. First, Roger has no solid evidence to assert that she never ordered the mac & cheese, considering he wrote nothing down, as well as the fact that there were two others (the third member of my party and me) that witnessed my friend ordering the mac & cheese. The second problem lies in Roger's failure to follow the norms for waiting staff. For the sake of argument, let's say that my friend did not order the mac & cheese. Even in this case, Roger should apologize for the mistake and promise to get it right away if he were a 'good' waiter in the orthodox sense of the phrase.  The above problems can be summarized by Roger's inability to recognize and/or attempt to compensate for his inabilities. Aside from the mac & cheese problem, he forgot other things that we asked for, i.e. boxes. He failed to bring the proper number of menus and failed to bring dessert silverware with or before the arrival of the dessert. I doubt I will ever find myself at this/a Cheesecake Factory ever again, but in the event that I do, I hope that my waiter or waitress is more qualified.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=20

KC C.,"Los Gatos, CA",5,118,1,1.0,11/20/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory must not have a standard restaurant wide list of expectations for their staff.  I go to the one at Valley Fair quite often, and I have never had such rude service.  I go to Palo Alto location on University ONCE and I'm already turned off.   Let me start by saying I am a pretty reasonable patron.  I get it....it was a Saturday night and there are no reservations so our party of 12 was quoted a 45 min wait.  After 60 minutes, I inquired how much longer it would be and one of the hosts, Adrian, said they were doing their best to get our table ready, and that they were just waiting for guests to leave.  At this point, they were already 15 minutes over the quoted wait time but we understood that we had a large party and that it was a Saturday night.  Another 15 minutes had passed and I inquired again, AFTER I had taken a walk around the restaurant.  I mentioned to Adrian that there was a set of five tables that could be pushed together and then also the people that he said they were waiting on to leave, they were all just sitting there on their iphones.  He looked at me like I was the one with the problem and said the same thing, but this time, he didn't apologize, nor did he even look me in the eye.  Instead, he turned to the next person and pretty much just disregarded me.  So now I'm really annoyed.  At this point there was nothing I could do but wait; but what I wanted to do was smack that smirk off his face.  15 minutes later, 45 minutes AFTER the initial quote time of 45 minutes, for a total of 1  1/2 hours, the other hostess, Patricia, seated us and profusely apologized.  I told her I understand the situation, but what made me angry was the way he just disregarded me, like 'here she comes again....let's just throw her a bone and say the same thing so I can get her off my back' is what I felt like he was thinking.  I was appalled at his behavior.   In fact, he did the same thing to a couple that was waiting longer than quoted but they were smart and LEFT.  I on the other hand had hungry children and stayed bc I THOUGHT I was going to be seated by the original quote time.

Basically be prepared to wait for every single thing for which you interact with the staff Price: A little pricy for the Ok food that is served Overall: Ok. Their Cheesecakes are a MUST try, I wouldn't recommend the food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=20
Michael W.,"Honolulu, HI",430,285,526,4.0,11/23/2016,"I came here for an impromptu lunch yesterday. It was fairly empty since it was almost 2pm. I was seated quickly and was able to get my food and finish before 2:30. I got the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was amazing! The sauce was rich, spicy, and had the Cajun flavors I expected. The chicken was a breast deep fried. Breaking was nice and crispy. It tasted very good too. The down side of the dish was that I can feel the fat in the dish. It was so rich, I was full after half the plate. I still finished it but had regrets for the next few hours.  The waitress I had was super nice. Took really good care of me and always had a smile on her face. Couldn't complain about the service. It was pretty good. I was sad I was too full for dessert though.

We wanted to avoid a noisy crowds at the local Palo Alto pubs and searching for where to have drinks and small plates. Found an open parking in front of here and it was perfect! I'd come here just for drinks. We sat at the bar area. Immediately got seated and started! Menu, bread, drinks and appetizers all started rolling out in less than 10mins. I will seriously now consider having meals at the bar area. Much quicker and attentive staff here versus the main dining where it's always crowded and you're often left wondering when the waiter is coming back!  That classic cheesecake factory bread is everything!  Flat bread - mozarella, tomato and basil on a thin crust,  a bit on greasy side.  Crab bites - should be renamed crab balls is mediocre. My friend liked it the most.  Spring rolls - good not the best. The roll could have been tighter. You have to adjust your grip on it after a first bite. It came with 2 dipping sauce - we started with the soy sauce based one. Edamame - a good snack in between convos Red Sangria - we ordered the white sangria but they were out of it so we settled for the red Hot Tea - they bring a box of tea for you to choose. A good variety.  Salted Caramel Cheesecake - very rich and decadent dessert. A delicious sinful pleasure on a Saturday evening.

Amy C.,"San Francisco, CA",299,410,1301,4.0,7/30/2016,"Even though The Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain, I always get excited about their desserts. Since today was National Cheesecake Day, I knew I had to go (they always do a half-off every cheesecake slice on these days, and this year they were offering the promotion for two days in a row). Also, they have a new cheesecake that features my absolute favorite dessert flavor - hazelnut. We arrived around 5pm on a Saturday and the place was already packed with a 20 minute wait. I like how they give you an electronic thing to hold, so you can go outside, wander around other stores, and then come back when it starts buzzing. Once we were seated, service was quite fast and attentive. My boyfriend ordered the Factory Burger ($11.99), which came with cheddar cheese, tomato, grilled onions on sourdough bread or wheat loaf, with either french fries or green salad. The burger was cooked well and was juicy. It was an interesting choice to put it on sourdough bread since it looked almost like sandwich halves than a burger, but I appreciated the extra hardness and crunchiness of the sourdough. The green salad was nicely dressed but not sodden in oil. We also ordered a slice of their new cheesecake: chocolate hazelnut cheesecake topped with hazelnut crunch and Nutella ($7.95 normally, but half-price today from the promotion). It came with a generous amount of whipped cream on the side and Nutella drizzled on top. The cheesecake was heaven. It was very sweet and definitely a calorie bomb, but it was dessert heaven. The hazelnut flavor in the cake was strong, and combined with the Nutella on top, was almost too sweet, but I still loved it. I also like the added crushed hazelnuts in the middle layer for additional crunch. I also ordered an appetizer of buffalo wings ($11.99). These were pricy for the amount of food, but the appetizer itself was quite good. The buffalo wings were spicy and crunchy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. I didn't quite care for the dipping sauce, which was a blue cheese dressing. I would have preferred a creamier dressing like ranch. Service was very friendly. They did forget to bring us bread which was disappointing, but overall they were very attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=40
Rafaela S.,"San Francisco, CA",41,60,105,4.0,3/31/2017,"Came here for appetizers, drinks, and dessert. We have been to this location a couple of times before to pick up dessert to go, but it was our first time seating down. It was a Friday night - so there was about a 15 minute wait. We just sat at a high top table by the bar to avoid the wait list.  A server helped us right away, got our drinks, and some bread to munch on. Thank goodness she did because our apps took about 25 minutes to come out. She did acknowledge and apologize for the wait and as we were not in a hurry, we didn't make a big deal of it. Apps - fried mac and cheese and crab wontons. They were typical appetizers, prepared well, and were served with plenty of dipping sauce. Cheesecake - we tried the chocolate hazelnut crunch! I just found out this is a rather new option on the menu. It was delicious - it may be taking the spot for my top choice (replacing the red velvet)! The creamy Nutella with the crunchy crust is a perfect combination. The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chains, but there are so many one of a kind restaurants in the  downtown area that it almost feels like a crime to go eat at a chain - I definitely recommend visiting the unique spots in the area if you're just visiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=40

One of the waiters there came to ask if we needed some more bread. I mentioned that could you get some of the brown ones. My server came back 5 min later saying that they run out of brown bread. While they were serving brown bread to other tables around us. This was weird.  I didn't say anything. Offered a 30+% tip and said cheer up! She had a frowned up face the entire time.

He stated that he had burnt his hand, and the server just walked away without a word about it. Hours later his hand is still red, that plate was very hot!

I told the manager that the mix up was not the issue, if they served me properly cooked fried chicken, I can just dismiss it as an honest mistake but to serve me almost entirely raw chicken could make me sick and put me in the hospital and THAT is inexcusable.

Karen H.,"San Diego, CA",14,1,,1.0,2/4/2017,"DON'T FORGET YOUR PONCHO OR SHIELD! And don't count on the manager to manage. I admit that I don't like leaving reviews because it can affect one's livelihood, but there was no way I could in good conscience not warn others about this incident.  Coming here can result in bodily harm, or at least harm to your clothes! I came with my family and purposely sat at the bar so we could watch a Warriors game while eating dinner.  We know that bar service can sometimes be hit or miss, but we didn't think we might actually get hit (with flying debris)! When my parents sat down, they saw water and ice all over the counter.  It was assumed that the previous guest had just been messy, but guess it was a sign of things to come. Throughout our short stay, a lovely (insert sarcasm here) bartender, named Scott, gave us a pregame show of continually slamming dishware (can only hope it wasn't glass) in the bin that must've been in front of the counter where we were sitting.  Thankfully his aim was almost as good as the Warriors'; that said the accuracy didn't continue... We didn't say anything because we didn't want to cause a fuss, but maybe if we did, we could've avoided the escalation of action. Scott's first miss of the ""basket"" was a plastic cup that bounced on the counter and almost knocked over my mom's wine glass before falling back behind the counter.  At this point I called the other bartender over to tell him about the situation.  I acknowledged that Scott might be having a bad day, but asked if our bartender could talk to him and stop the show.  He assured us he that he would talk to Scott and apologized about the slamming of dishware. Unfortunately, before he was able to speak with Scott, the next miss happened and the result was the remaining ice and drink in the cup he was throwing, splashing all over the counter, my parents, and myself.  Sorry Scott, I think only coaches of winning teams get this type of treatment at the END of a game. The result: my mom immediately screamed!   Scott's response: a haphazard, ""I'm sorry..."" As he slowly wiped up the mess with a rag.   The manager's response (who happened to be at the drink receiving station at the time, kudos on the timing): ""What happened?"" And then he walked around to the back of the counter to approach Scott. My dad and I pushed back from the counter and tried to wipe the mess off ourselves.  My mom immediately went to the hostess counter to ask for the manager.  Just a note: if you're the manager and see something like this you should immediately apologize and start handling the situation.  The fact that my mom didn't see you and ran to the front of the restaurant, to seek you out speaks volumes.  As my dad and I were wiping ourselves off, the manager looked at me wiping my face with my sleeve and proceeded to Scott instead of even offering napkins for us to clean ourselves with (this was so far into the meal that we hadn't even received napkins yet!) or apologize.  Here was another chance for you to manage, manager! At this point, I lost all faith in the manager being able to handle the situation and didn't even bother trying to speak with him.  I got up and gathered our jackets to leave.  My mom came back with the hostess, who pointed the manager out.  She looked 100% more concerned about the situation than both Scott and the manager. My parents spoke with the manager for a bit, before I butted in and said I had already been splashed on and we should just leave.   At this point they continued walking to the front talking and got the manager's card before we finally left.  The manager said he would speak with the bartender, but didn't really apologize or grab our contact information to follow up with us.  When we left, Scott was still working behind the bar... In the end, I'm thankful that glass shards didn't hit us in the face and that we only left with dirty clothes and not more injuries from the assault.  Amazing that this can happen in a major chain restaurant, but at least we can follow up with corporate about our concerns because this manager clearly didn't care.  Scott clearly seems to have an anger management issue and should probably avoid human interaction anytime in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=60
Ron Y.,"Palo Alto, CA",20,75,11,1.0,1/29/2017,"Normally I don't criticize chain restaurants. I'm a food snob, so I feel bad calling out chains, since they do some things well (e.g., consistent level of quality across locations, family friendly, affordable, good for big parties). * * * However, my dish today was so disappointing that I need to tell you to NOT order the fried chicken & waffles benedict. I decided to order it because I saw the promo photo on their big LCD screen while waiting for a table. The photo looks like this:  It looks tasty, right? Fried chicken? Waffles? Poached eggs? Yum. What was wrong with my dish today: 1) poached eggs were hard boiled, and 90% of the surrounding egg whites were gone. They were basically two tiny almost-hard yolks wrapped with a thin layer of egg white. I suppose the chef cracked the eggs into a pot of water at rolling boil, so the egg whites dispersed. 2) the waffles were thin and super soggy. The promo photo shows thick and crispy belgian waffles with maple syrup in small metal cup. However, my dish came with the syrup already applied to the waffles (no metal cup). Since service was very slow, my thin waffles were mushy by the time they came to the table. Plus, it didn't taste like real maple syrup. It had a sickening fake butter taste to it. It reminded of me of ""table syrup"" from my elementary school cafeteria. 3) the chicken tenders were very small. I guess the chef is trying to help me lose weight. Otherwise, they tasted fine. (It was the best part of the dish).  On the bright side, this location is much less busy than other locations (e.g., at Valley Fair).

Services:  Depending when you come here, you have a different crew.   - AM/Lunch crew:   Good services.  one of our entrees need to be re-do and the manager (a middle aged man) came over and explained.  We appreciate that a lot.  It was all proactive.   I would totally rate 4 stars for their effort.  - Takeout crew:  There was a female mgr that is not as friendly.  The crew seems to be afraid of her.   Food/drinks:    - Great bread before  - Black peppered Cajun Shrimp - Very tasty and spicy.  Would totally order this again. - Manderia Chicken - One of our favorites - Pasta Cabonara - with Shrimp.  The PA location seems to make their shrimp pretty good.  One of the pasta has GF option.  They can replace it with Brown rice pasta.  :)  - Salads - Most of their salads are solid and huge portion - Kids menu - Mac/Cheese - creamy and cheesy.   - Kids menu - Spaghetti and meatball.  OK.   One time, they told us they ran out of meatball and if we would just spaghetti with pasta sauce.   (Really???) Tips:  Sometimes their food is a bit salty.   It is your preference, but I would ask them to go light on the salt next time. Decor: Causal and lots of seating. Kids friendly:  Yes.     Gluten Free/Sensitivity:  There a number of options labeled as GF.  The only cheesecake that is officially GF is the Godiva chocolate.  It is really good!  My hubby is not a chocolate fan and he commented how smooth it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=100

I didn't expect that I would have to wait another 20 minutes for the sauce to come at which point we had both finished our meal.

Iris T.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/5/2017,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory already a couple of times and I am super excited about their cheesecake. However, yesterday I had THE WORST experience ever with The Cheesecake Factory. We were with a group of people and wanted to order some cheesecake for dessert. We ordered 5 pieces of original cheesecake with hot fudge sauce via Doordash and waited for the cheesecake to be delivered. After the delivery, we found out that 2 of the 5 cheesecake pieces had come in DEEPFROZEN and we were unable to eat them. Also, there were only 3 VERY SMALL cups of hot fudge sauce delivered, which were not even enough for half of us...  So I called The Cheesecake Factory to ask them for an explanation and to fix the problem. In the first place they blamed the Doordasher and told me to call Doordash, which frustrated me even more. When I insisted that The Cheesecake Factory had to fix the problem theirselves, the woman on the other side of the line eventually agreed to call Doordash and let the Doordasher come back to bring new cheesecake.  The Doordasher eventually came back with new cheesecake and hot fudge sauce, but he didn't even get paid for this extra delivery...

Amy K.,"Foster City, CA",19,126,24,2.0,3/24/2017,"Chain restaurants are not my go to places to eat, but my 10 year old son loves Cheesecake Factory.  And since it was his birthday, I obliged. We went on a Thursday evening around 6:30 pm. The two of us were seated immediately.  Our server took our drink order soon after we were seated. My son wanted a fountain drink and our server suggested a Shirley Temple. But when he returned with my water, he informed us that they were out of Shirley Temples. WHAT!?  So my son asked for a Sprite. Nope. The Sprite machine was empty.  How is a soda machine at a huge chain restaurant empty?  He ordered a Roy Rogers instead.  For dinner my son had the kid's menu fried chicken sliders with fries. It was your run of the mill chain restaurant sliders. Nothing special.  I ordered the hamburger and side salad off the Skinnylicious menu. Don't do it!  You'll be extremely disappointed!  When my burger came out, I almost wanted to laugh...really!?  I realize this is supposed to be a lower calorie dish, but come on!  I was served a slider sized hamburger patty on a regular sized brioche bun with a side salad. I seriously thought the burger was a joke. At least if you're going to cut the size of the burger, cut the size of the bun to match. It was absolutely ridiculous to serve such a small burger in the middle of a gigantic bun. I wish I had taken a picture of this to show how absurd this dish looked!  If I'd known it was going to come out like that, I would've just ordered sliders and only eaten one of them. At least the bun to patty ratio would've made sense, as opposed to my having at least half of my bun wasted because there was no meat to go with it. Seriously, who thought that dish with that presentation was a good idea?  He or she should be fired! I felt like I was getting cheated in my meal or the kitchen playing a very distasteful joke on me. So disappointing. Here's a tip, if you want your customers to think they're eating on the healthier side, don't make them feel like they made the wrong choice or feel awful because they can't have the full size meal with your presentation. Make them feel like they made a good choice and are satisfied with what they ordered. At least the side salad and dressing were good and decently presented.  And really, Cheesecake Factory, are you that cheap that you can't even offer a kid a free ice cream on his birthday?  Of course I bought him an ice cream sundae since it was his birthday (and he doesn't like cheesecake).

Adam P.,"Austin, TX",0,8,7,1.0,6/27/2017,"Used to love coming here. But in last year service has been horrible. Just the overall attitude and atmosphere of this place has gone down hill.  Specifically with female waitresses. They hire these people who either are having the worst day of their life, or just hate being alive all together. They make you just want to pay for your food and leave as soon as possible.  The dessert is great here, usually the best part, but the past few times I've gone the service sucked so bad I just left before without ordering dessert because I did not want to feel as though the waitress was doing me a personal favor by getting a cheesecake.  And at that point the less interacting with the waitress the better. Get a new manager in that place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=80
Zoe Y.,"San Francisco, CA",952,213,239,1.0,12/3/2016,"0 stars! Literally the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. My boyfriend lives close to this location and we always order take-out because I love CF. We have had a few orders wrong from here before, but it's usually something small (for example, they often forget to give Cesar salad dressing with the Cesar salad). Upon our last visit (November 20, 2016) we walked through at about 11pm and placed an order to go. We ordered a Cesar salad, the Four Cheese pasta, Shrimp and Sausage pasta, and two Mango Key Lime cheesecakes. After waiting approximately 30 minutes for our order, we finally received it and checked it and left. When we got home, my boyfriend pulled out his pasta (shrimp and sausage) and it was wrong! Even though we checked it (both dishes have rigatoni), we were deceived by the similar pasta and the condensation on the clear takeout lid. His dish (I included a picture) was probably the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life. I have no idea what it was, but it was terrible. I called the manager, Amy, back, however it was after they closed and they could not do anything for me at the moment. She asked if I paid with a credit card or cash, and unfortunately I made the mistake of paying with cash. She said she could either send me a gift card ""in the mail"" or I could come in and have it re-made, but there was no way to get a refund. I gave her my address and 2 weeks later, have still not received anything. She was so rude and unhelpful when clearly her incompetent employees cannot tell the difference between Shrimp and Sausage pasta vs Rigatoni with vegetables. We will not return; instead we will gladly drive the extra 15 minutes to a different location. I do not recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=80

Patrick A.,"San Jose, CA",169,85,139,2.0,12/5/2016,"(This was hard to write.) I went to Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto with my girlfriend for a quick bite before going home after work. Our visit started out well, but it ended in disappointment. Our server was a very friendly woman named Maria S. and she began trying to sell us drinks and appetizers during the walk to our seats, which was a first for us both. When she sat us, in her section of course, Maria immediately tried selling an appetizer and ""something hot"" to drink once more. When we said that water was fine to start, Maria questioned our decision, ""That's all you want for now?""  From the time she dropped off waters and bread and pushed apps to the time she took our order, we waited 19 minutes. She continued to repeat what we said, but she repeated it as a question, which was a little unnerving after the fifth time. Either way, her soft-spoken voice and kind demeanor made it easy to accept. However, we still had to declare ""no appetizer"" three times. I sympathized at first, then it became hard.  When our food was delivered by the food runners (just under 20 minutes later), my beer had not been delivered. Maria was nowhere in sight so I could voice my complaint, so I went to the bar myself, and sure enough she was right there socializing with her coworkers. I asked the bar tender for a 16 ounce Stella. 13 minutes later I was walking back to my seat. Being a bit annoyed, I walked right past Maria and she didn't say a word when she saw me with my beer.  I sat down and began eating my now cold Chicken Madera, and she was still nowhere to be found. 20 minutes later, she walked past our table with a couple waters and a basket of bread for a table near ours, but she didn't say a word. She absolutely missed the two-bite rule. In fact, she didn't stop to talk to us until it was time for her to try and sell more. We asked for the check and she insisted that we order a cheesecake. ""No, thank you,"" we said together. She ignored us, ""One or two pieces?"" she said. Again we said ""no."" Then she asked again, ""What? No cheesecake? Are you sure?"" Now, I was completely frustrated, so I quickly replied, ""No!"" She came back five minutes later with our check, and, of course, she charged us for the beer.  At first, I was convinced that she had simply forgotten to deliver the beer, but after she began arguing that she delivered it, she insisted that the beer I had was the beer that she delivered. That's when I knew that she was lying and was hoping that we missed the extra charge. I declined once more. At this point, my smile was gone. I politely asked her to remove it, which she said agreed to do and asked to take my credit card, but she had lost my trust, and I was unwilling to provide my payment directly to her. That's when we decided to pay at the front. 12 minutes later, she found us in the front, handed me the check, said ""Have a good night, bye!"" and quickly walked away. Amy (the manager) came out to great us, but I was too frustrated to speak to her in length, so I only mentioned that I had to buy my own beer. She stated that she would ""follow up"" with Maria, but I was not convinced. Tonight, at the Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto, which is one of my favorite places to eat, it was the first time that I had ever felt judged by a fellow Latino, it was the first time that a server ever tried to charge me extra and insist it was my mistake, and, worst of all, it was the first time at Cheesecake that I ever received poor service. Two stars for the food. =(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=80

Avocado egg rolls were prepared in hurry and were not in roll shape at all and very oily. Still OK. Fried Mac & Cheese took a while. Still OK - deep frying can take time. Problem came with main course. 8 entrees were ordered. 3 people were strictly vegetarian in our group: Prob 1: We ordered Evelyn's favorite pasta  veggie burger for 2 vegetarian people in our group. Server returned after 15-20 minutes saying sorry we dont have Veggie burger. So we asked him to double the Evelyn's pasta. Prob 2: Server came after 15 minutes. We dont have Evelyn pasta as well. So we ordered Pasta Da Vinci & Louisiana chicken pasta with chicken on side so that vegetarian people can have food. Prob 3: Main course came 35-45 minutes after the food was ordered. By that time our hunger already died by waiting and drinking water Prob 4: After 15 minutes of main course serving, the pasta came. Both Evelyn & Louisiana Pasta were Raw and hard(not cooked properly). All of that was left in plate and wasted. Thats $34 + taxes in waste right away. Prob 5: Requested for shrimp on side in 4 cheese pasta but shrimp was mixed in food. On informing the manager, she just apologized and nothing else. Is this what you expect from the restaurant with a bill of $235.99 + gratuities? She just apologized and made the cheesecake complimentary. My understanding was that cheesecake is complimentary for birthday girl.  Anyways horrible experience especially with the management in not understanding the situation at all.

The fish tacos I ordered barely had any chipotle sauce. I had to ask for more. The beans and rice were warm, not fresh and tasteless. The fish tacos, fried, were not hot and just lacked flavor. No seasoning, nothing. Cabbage was almost non existent in the tacos. My moms garlic sauce pasta was not hot as well and barely had any sauce. She asked for sauce and never got it. Waitress forgot. My mom didn't like it. My dads chicken pasta was probably the best, but that's not saying much. And the bill: $50 for terrible food??? No thanks.

But the wait was actually 50min. 1st waiter came in fast and took our drinks order. After 20min we asked another waiter about our order. He could not locate 1st waiter and proceeded to take our food order. About 15min later (35min total) 1st waiter appeared with drinks order. And did not bring everything we ordered! 3rd waiter appeared 15 min later and said that they did not ha e a food order for our table. She did excuse the situation but then took the food order again. Now we have waited another 25min and still don't have the food or all the drinks! Just gave them 5min to fix or we are leaving. Wow food appeared within 1min of leaving. Not all 3 dishes though. What a crappy place. Stay away.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=180

A G.,"Union City, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/29/2017,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to!!! There were 3 in my party - we came here for lunch around noon on Friday 7/28. The place wasn't busy so we got seated right away. However, all food attendants simply walked by and no one made eye contact with anyone at our table. So after about 20 minutes, one of us went to the counter to ask for an attendant. We ordered drinks and I ordered their Special Lemonade on the menu. The lemonade came and I asked if it was the special lemonade - the server said there's no such thing as Special Lemonade. I pointed it out on the menu and I got a smile and a comment that it simply has more ice than the regular one!! Ohhh...okay....so we ordered our food. Despite the place being almost empty, it took another half hour to get our food...with the one seated next to us who came after us being served first. So we kept our cool. I ordered the Miso Salmon which I proceeded to eat....until I bit into a shrimp tail which was sandwiched between the salmon and rice. It was NOT a shrimp...it was the SHELL of a shrimp tail!!! So we flagged the server who then took my plate. My coworker said that people are allergic to shellfish i.e. shrimps should not be combined with fish! The server said fish and shrimps are in the same category...we were flabbergasted!! I waited for the rest of my party to finish their meal then someone came to our table to ask if I would like something else to eat or maybe even dessert. At this point, I've lost my appetite and why would I eat dessert without a main meal??? So I said NO, I've lost my appetite. In addition, I don't know what they'll do with my food if I decide to order something else. I've heard horror stories about what food servers and kitchen staff do with unhappy restaurant clients and would not want to be a victim. So that  person who asked if I wanted anything else, and who did not identify herself, was even unapologetic and just left the table without saying anything like as if I even owe her an apology!! The people in this restaurant don't know what customer service and service recovery means - they need to be trained!!! Be careful of this place!! If you really like Cheesecake Factory, go to another location....NOT this one!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=160
James M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,29,8,1.0,4/30/2017,"First off, disclaimer, I worked for the Cheesecake Factory in Valley Fair for a year. It has always been one of my favorite spots so for me to give it 1 star review means they really were not up to par today. I was by myself so I sat in the bar, no wait. That might have been a sign. I ordered my usual favorite, chicken piccata with white rice instead of the usual pasta it comes with. 20 mins later food comes out, I was ok waiting, the bread was good as usual and was watching basketball game on tv. As I started to dig in I realized right away something was off. It didn't taste right. After 3 or 4 bites I realized the chicken piccata was missing a key ingredient, the capers. You cannot have chicken piccata without capers, otherwise the dish tastes like a bland chicken in cream sauce... no flavor. I was waiting for waiter to come around so I could complain, but he was so busy with 3 new tables that I started to pick at it. To make it worse they even messed up the rice, it was mushy and not good. So my whole plate sucked but I was hungry... my waiter never came back to check on me so I ate it.... how can you complain about a dish after you have eaten it all.... so I paid and left, gave my usual tip because I felt guilty somehow like it wasn't his fault the dish sucked and he was over sat. 15 mins after leaving when my stomach started to ache I realized I would never be back to this location .... what is the point of having a chain restaurant if each location cannot make the dishes the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=160
Julissa J.,"Newark, CA",6,3,12,1.0,9/9/2016,"If I could give this particular restaurant 0 stars I would in a heartbeat but unfortunately we are obligated to give at least one star. I've gone to The Cheesecake Factory restaurants in Pleasanton, San Francisco, and San Jose and have yet to even experience this from ANY restaurant. I have gone to this Cheesecake Factory establishment before with my parents and the service had been very slow for there being no one there.  My friend called in a week before the date on 8/30 to reserve a table for 15 people, the person on the phone said no problem we will see you on 9/6. We call on 9/6 thirty minutes before the reservation to see if it was a possibility to move it to a later time. We explain to the receptionist what the situation is and her response was ""that's funny because we don't take reservations"". A very unprofessional answer to a customer and that should've been a hint. We get the restaurant and wait for the rest of our party. As we wait the receptionist pulls out a brush and brushes her hair!!!!! Not a joke. It blew our minds.  Finally after getting seated our orders are taken and all is going well. One hour after our orders were taken both appetizers and meals come out, yes, at the same time. We finished our meals and asked for boxes, take home desserts, and the check. We received one single bill when in the beginning we asked the waiter to split the check in whichever way is easier for her (some of us were waiters and understand the pain of split checks). After collecting money and cards we hand the bill to our waiter to get out of there as fast as we could. The waiter comes back to tell us that she cant take our money and cards because she can't split the check that way. We had given her the EXACT amount in cash, and 6 credit cards. We even wrote on the back the specific amount each card would be charged. We ask for the manager politely because at this point we are tired and had been there for 3 hours. 20 mintues later we explain the situation to the manager and she tells us she can't do it. She gave us a hard time and that took another 20 minutes to figure it out.  This is by far the worst service Id ever received. Not even an apology for the situation was issued. Definitely not going back to this specific Cheesecake Factory. Save your self the agony.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=160

Twice I was told that the Cheesecake would be free since it was his birthday.We got our food and drinks. My parents pasta was extremely dry, I asked for more sauce and I let her know of the quality of the their pasta and she gave me a dirty look, not even an apology. My boyfriends and my sister boyfriends fries were extremely stale but we just didn't care to say anything.

It was already almost 11!They come to our table like 20 mins later with a small cup of ice cream for my father who turned 56! After I told them to bring him cheese cake!

I figured at 5:30 on opening football Sunday it wouldn't be busy and it wasn't, so I sort of bullied hubs into going. Our waitress was super prompt and it was all downhill from there. Drinks: two waters and an iced tea. Except virtually no ice. Before I can say ""hey!"" Waitress is gone, not to reappear for 20 minutes. She gives us our appetizer and refills my iced tea. Then disappears.  For an hour.  She comes back w my son's food and says ""Sorry, the kitchen is really slow"" but...by this time people seated after us have ordered, eaten and left. Kiddo's food is disgusting. Potatoes look like they are made of plastic and its that ""cold food on a hot plate"" thing that lets you know it sat under the warming lights getting fake baked.  But then my dinner came (10 min after my kid is served). Disgusting. Lemon herb chicken w the very saddest presentation you can imagine. Watercress reduced to two sad, wilted sprigs. Random chicken pieces, and weird oil all over everything.  Hubs gets manager. She takes my plate. And 1/2 an hour later I get served my dinner. Hubs dinner was cold and his salad a hot wilted mess but they can only fix one thing. We ask twice to replace my son's mashed potatoes.

I feel I could damage my eyes just by reading the menu. The bathrooms were clean and sanitary though.  When I came for dinner with my boyfriend, I ordered the calamari and shrimp scampi. The calamari was ~$12 and the shrimp scampi was ~$20. I have to emphasize that the calamari was DELICIOUS. My boyfriend - who's very picky with calamari - loved it. The squid was tender to the point that you wouldn't need teeth to bite it. You can also tell that it was hand breaded. It also came with cocktail and garlic sauce! The garlic sauce was perfect! I just had to scrape every last bit of it off the bowl. The shrimp scampi on the other hand was meh. For a dish worth ~$20, I expected the pasta to be at least fresh. Not the kinds I can simply buy off grocery markets. Another con is the ends of the angel hair pasta. They were stuck together! The shrimp were good but a little over battered. The sauce was also overpowering with garlic. When I inspected them closely, there were 4 full cloves... I think dicing them up would be better?

Idk if that's a technique or what not but yeah the burgers came back with ketchup still so by now I was like whatever its cool. But others in the party are a little stubborn including the kids and urged them to try again. Of course it came back with ketchup and by now the burgers were almost reaching well done and everyone else was close to finishing.

If those had been through a dishwasher even once, they would be gone or mostly gone at least. Yuck! Didn't send the pizza back, they were busy and we didn't want to wait for anything new. Wouldn't have even said anything except someone who said they were a manager when asked delivered a second glass of wine. The waiter said his name was ""...Johnny?..."" , so not sure if he knew. When we told the ""manager"", he thanked us for bringing it to his attention, then....didn't do anything!  We did eat the pizza, so I didn't expect anything off the bill, but how are you not going to offer or bring without offering a CLEAN glass of water???? Mind you, he knew we weren't leaving right away, he had just delivered a glass of wine! (We had also ordered cheesecake.) Seriously???

Cynthia M.,"San Francisco, CA",43,436,75,3.0,2/15/2015,"I came here for brunch on a Sunday at 10:30am, and it was pretty empty. I was surprised because I've never been to Cheesecake factory without having to wait. Apparently if you want to be immediately seated, you should come before lunchtime. I've gone to many different Cheesecake Factories in different cities, and this one was pretty comparable to the other ones that I've been to in regards to food. Our waitress was really nice, and she made sure we had everything we needed. As a con, although we were one of probably 5 tables filled, it took a pretty long to get our food (over 30 minutes). This may have been because we were one of the first tables of the day, but it was still pretty long. Complimentary Bread (4.5/5) - Sadly, one of my favorite things about coming to Cheesecake Factory is the bread. They had both the signature brown bread and a Sourdough baguette. Pretzel Crusted Chicken (4/5) - The pretzel crust made the outside very crispy, and the chicken itself was juicy. It came with two different sauces, which looked homemade and were tasty. The presentation was also nice. They arranged the chicken strips in a lattice pattern. Loaded Baked Potato Tots (2/5) - These were just wayyyy to rich for me. I guess Cheesecake Factory is known for their rich food, but the potato part of these tots had A LOT of cheese in them.

Steve K.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/4/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times in plenty of locations.  This particular location is one that you should stay away from (Palo Alto).  The owners should be embarrassed and corporate should look into punishing them. We arrived and were told there was a 10 minute wait.  Went to the bar, grabbed drinks, and waited to be buzzed.  Our buzzer buzzed and we went to the host station only to have to wait another five minutes while they sorted out which of the currently doing nothing hosts could actually accomplish the feat of directing my family to a table.  Servers stopped by to chit chat.  A manager came and somehow made it an even longer process. We get sat. (Yay!)  I chit chat with my family.  I read through the entire menu (if you've been to Cheesecake Factory, you know how long the menus are).  I read through the ads on the menu.  I realize that we've been at the table for lord knows how long and nobody has even stopped by our table to even say ""I'll be with you soon.""   I got to play the ""I need some attention"" game with servers passing by left and right, but none would pay attention.  Finally I managed to grab the host that sat us so he could find us a server.  Five minutes later... We order our food.  I decided to take the opportunity to run across the street to Apple and have something taken care of.  I walked over there while most of my family waited for food.  Turns out the line was long.  I waited.  I finally got taken care of and walked back.  I was sure my wife would be upset and my food would be cold.  Nope.  No food. After a while, two plates of food came out.  A reasonable amount of time passed and nothing else.  A few more minutes and I see the same person who delivered the first two plates come into the room.  He had someone else's food.  My wife points out that the people at the table next to us (who have been there a good 25 minutes at that point) have not been helped.  The people behind us are bent out of shape because they got ignored as well and one of there dishes was completely inedible.  (Pasta just completely soaked in oil) I'm flabbergasted.  Three more plates come out.  My poor wife.  No food for her.  We wait patiently.  Finally I had to stand up and get in front of our server and ask the question ""is my wife going to get food tonight?""  10 minutes later my wife finally got her food.  Fresh from the microwave. Did a manager ever come talk to us?  No. Did the server make sure we were taken care of?  No. We had to steal silverware from an empty table. We had to deal without ketchup for french fries. It took 5 minutes to refill my drink.  Which would have been plenty of time if my drink wasn't taken from me to refill it in the first place. I was so proud of my kids for not making a fuss for the entire meal.  They deserve medals.  We had one saving grace.  We had ordered an entire cheesecake at the beginning.  Now that it was an hour and a half later, we could eat it as soon as we got home. I arrived at home and opened my cheesecake...   They gave me the wrong damn cheesecake! The woman behind me never did get a satisfactory meal.  They left in frustration.  The family next to us eventually did get served... after I mentioned to both our server and the host who eventually got us our server.   Honestly, there are some great options in downtown Palo Alto.  Epi, a few doors down has great food and great service.  Nola is solid as well a few blocks away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=160

Ofra M.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/17/2017,"Possible the worst service ever that I encountered in a place advertising as a family restaurant. It took very long to find us a place and to set up the table though the place was not full and then to come and take our orders. We then waited more than an hour for our food after we asked about it several times. Dishes, such as the hamburger or steak were dry and not fresh as if they waited long to be served and then perhaps warmed in some way. And on top of it the manager arrived to check with us what was wrong, heard all about it and just went away without even apologising, or trying to explain or perhaps returning later o suggest something as a compensation. I would give it a minus star if there were something like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=140

Bhavna M.,"San Francisco, CA",3,7,,1.0,4/6/2017,"Food was good, however our server was quite possibly the worst server I've ever had. We came in at 6:30 and ordered appetizers and dinner for kids (with 1 toddler and 2 kids), and then ordered 5 adult entrees. Needed two booster seats, which were not given for about 10 minutes or so. When asking the waiter about them, his response was verbatim ""I'm a little busy right now, I'll get to it in a minute."" We waited an hour before asking for the manager and asking what happened to our food. Nothing was done, we were told food was 2 minutes out. Then appetizers and entrees all came out together (which we specifically asked that appetizers come out first ) at 7:45PM. Given the delay, we didn't even touch our appetizers. Then, asked the waiter for water for our toddler and waited over 10 minutes for water. When asked where the water was, his response was ""Yea,"" and brought it out 5 minutes later. It was my bday dinner and my husband ordered my favorite cheesecake, which the staff had to ask about 3 times to apparently confirm which cheesecake slice it was.  Gabriele B was a rude server and I would never in my life hire someone like him. I have worked in the service industry and have never spoken to any customer the way he spoke to us. We were not rude, or impatient with him and literally until the end of the dinner, we gave him the benefit of the doubt, but he not did not apologize once for his service nor did he rectify the situation or errors in anyway, other than a few app's which we didn't even eat. Not only was he apathetic, but he smirked and laughed as we left, to the point where neither my husband, nor I, nor our friends wanted to tip him. I highly recommend this specific location find a better server.  After we went to a manager three times, she (Jenna) came to the table to apologize profusely, but at that point we were packing up, paying our bill (which we had to take to the front to pay as our waiter was disinterested in serving us and was busy meandering with his friends), and we told the manager he was quite possibly the worst employee we've ever seen in any establishment.

There was a large contingent of overactive pre-teens having a birthday party. Their behaviour and volume was more appropriate for a pizza parlor rather than a fine dining establishment. Their loud and raucous activity made it difficult for us and other diners to carry on a conversation. There was very little or no parental supervision and it's not the kids fault they acted that way it's whoever was in charge. It seemed like the wait staff tried to calm them down by dimming the lights hoping they would speak softer but it really didn't help.

Tandis N.,"San Jose, CA",31,49,16,1.0,2/26/2017,"I am a fair reviewer and I've worked in the restaurant industry for seven years as a server and a manager. I was extremely disappointed in both the quality of food and the attitude of the waitstaff tonight. We were seated in A timely fashion, but that was the only part of our experience that was decent. We were led to a small booth right next to the bathroom and a service station. Before seating ourselves we asked if there was another table available and the guy who was seating is (not a host, some staff member in all white) rudely responded ""no. That's all we have. You can wait for another table."" So, we sat down anyways. We were 4 tall adults and the booth barely fit us. About three minutes later, I noticed a party of two was seated in a bigger booth near ours. After some time, the server came with waters and bread and told us she'd be back shortly. Five minutes later she returned and we were ready to order. The server was nice and took our drink and food orders.  We didn't have any napkins so we asked her for some. I ordered the hibachi steak medium and my mother ordered the steak Diane medium. The other two people ordered a salmon dish and a shrimp dish. When the food arrived I noticed immediately that both steaks were clearly overcooked. There was no pink at all, definitely NOT medium. We were hungry, so we are. After five minutes the server came to ask how the food was. I told her that the steaks were cooked well done and not to our liking, and the salmon was dry as well. She didn't ask if we wanted the dishes re-done, if we would rather have anything else, I don't think she even apologized. She just nodded and so my father again asked for napkins (which she had never brought) and she used that opportunity to leave. She brought the napkins and that was the last we saw of her until the check. Never asked if we wanted anything else or another round of drinks. Another server eventually caught my eye and came over to ask if I needed anything. I asked for a box and the check, which he brought. The original server only returned then to run our check, forgetting to bring back the credit card. We asked another server for it and left after paying. I really live Cheesecake Factory but probably won't return to this one since the staff seems to be mediocre at best. If a customer complains about something, it is the servers responsibility to make it right. Had she offered anything to alleviate the circumstance, even offering a free dessert, it would have shown concern.

I went for brunch and 3 of us decided to order the crab benedict.  Our server returned 5 min later to tell us it was not ready.  We were surprised by that and she offered to double check.  10 min later she returned and confirmed that we were out of luck.  So we ordered other dishes that varied from good to bad.  Among the bad (really bad) was a veggie benedict I ordered.  It was served on two overcooked and super greasy fried cakes of grains.  Served on top of that were tiny, cubed, grilled, overly greasy vegetables.  On top of that were two overcooked eggs (ala hard boiled consistency).  On top of that was an overly salty hollandaise sauce.  And next to this mess of a dish was an abundant side of super greasy hash browns.

Or is this to make customers just give up, and stop complaining as well as going to this business??? ---------------------------- The latest review about needing a rain poncho - I think one also need skates to walk in their bar area. For about couple years now the stone flooring in the bar area is always slippery, obviously due to food/drinks spilled on the floor, and lack of proper cleaning. It was to the point you can easily slipped if you're wearing leather sole shoes or heels. Many of my friends joked about ice skating.  Surely the management understand the liability risk here? About bartenders?  It's a hit or miss. I have observed one bartender who does seem to be making a lot of noise behind counter, not sure if it's the same one from the other review. That does take away the supposed calm and enjoyable ambiance a bit. And for sure not the high end restaurants their competitors are on same street.

Jeremy H.,"Stanford, CA",3,50,,1.0,7/20/2015,"Vegetarians, beware! Coming out of a mini Yelp retirement to comment on my experiences this past weekend. On Saturday night, a large group of us (12, to be precise) came to The Cheesecake Factory around 9:30 PM after a concert at Stanford. It took us 30 mins or so to be seated even though there were plenty of seats (we think they didn't have enough servers for the restaurant).  After we got seated, I ordered the avocado, mushroom, and zucchini fries. I asked our server (who was very friendly) what the soup of the day was, and after she told me it was chicken soup, I replied that I would stick with the vegetable fries since I'm vegetarian. Our food came some 20 minutes later. I was halfway through my ""fries"" - basically breaded and fried pieces of vegetables - when I bit into one, and had an unfamiliar taste and texture. I examined it carefully, and it most definitely was NOT a vegetable. It was impossible to tell before biting into it because the breaded pieces of zucchini and avocado were opaque and not distinct, but a WHOLE PIECE of chicken had been fried and included in my food, and I had accidentally eaten half of the piece. I notified my server (mainly to let them know so that if there was a mix up, other people wouldn't have to go through this), who said that my dish should not have any meat, but took the other half of the piece of meat back to the kitchen to investigate. She came out five minutes later to inform me that it was, indeed, chicken - she told me the kitchen in the back was a ""huge mess"" (her words) and apparently the kitchen staff had messed up. She also commented that the manager or general manager had been notified. She was apologetic and friendly, and ended up comping this dish. However, I'm giving The Cheesecake Factory one star, given that their server self-admitted that their kitchen was a ""big mess"" and that I was served meat in what was supposed to be a vegetarian dish. I don't ask much of my restaurants, but I would like confidence in a clean kitchen that is able to serve the food that is ordered and be organized enough to ensure that meat does not get into vegetarian dishes. Admittedly, their cheesecake was really good, but I'm going to have to give one of my rare one-star reviews here because of my experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=200

I called ahead to order a cheesecake for pick-up to bring home after work. It took me a 1/2 hour to get there and find parking so I figured I'll be able to walk in, pay for the cheesecake, and leave. I gave my name at the dessert counter, paid, then waited. A couple behind me placed an order. I was waiting 10 minutes and asked why my cheesecake wasn't ready yet, after all I called ahead. And it wasn't a meal order. Just one whole cheesecake. I was told it would be right out and that someone was preparing it. I reminded them that I called ahead, so why wasn't it ready? The cashier apologized and said it will be right out. I went to the host and asked for the manager. While I was waiting (5 more minutes) two boxes were delivered from the back and the couple who had ordered behind me left with their order. The other order was mine. When the manager arrived I complained about the wait time but she couldn't explain why my order wasn't ready when I arrived. She offered me a discount which I accepted, but seriously?

The food wasn't very good either, coffee was old and bitter, she did serve fresher coffee. The Cesar salad tasted like fish. The bread was cold, so no use for the butter.

Finally after the server came to our table he had the audacity to ask what drinks we wanted. Screw drinks we were ready to order after just seating there for that long. He took our order and said he would be back with our drinks and bread soon, as the kids were very hungry and thirsty.  Another 15 min later and NO drinks or even free BREAD, yet the table across from us had their bread and drinks served right away.

Being avoided like you are the Black Plague.  2. Waiting forever for someone to take your order for drinks and food.  3. Waiting even longer for your food to come out.  4. Your party's food will come out at different times OR  5. Some of your party's food will not come out at all.  *Good luck asking for any drink refills or for bags and boxes to pack up your food too.  A very important tip, Cheesecake Factory: When you have a party that consists of 20 or more people, there needs to be more than ONE waiter taking drink and food orders. We had almost 30 people in our party and only ONE PERSON took our orders. Smh The only time there was a lot of waiters around is when they came to hand out plates. However, even then it didn't really matter because not everyone's food even made it out of the kitchen. 2 people in our party NEVER EVEN GOT THEIR FOOD.  Seriously?! How can you not even bring someone's food out at all and don't even come back to apologize or bring something else to compensate for the missing dish? But instead, you just let them be hungry and watch everyone else eat their food.  I haven't been at this particular Cheesecake Factory in quite some time and it's sad and frustrating to see that the service has gone completely down the drain.

Nevertheless, we had to wait 5 minutes to be seated because of a lack of staff. We waited another 30 minutes for the food. The chicken was only lukewarm. The shrimp was overcooked, possibly leftover from yesterday. The kid's grilled cheese sandwich was burnt, and it contained a piece of lettuce.

Andy B.,"San Ramon, CA",5,100,291,3.0,6/4/2014,"Man, what happened to the food quality at The Cheesecake Factory? When I was younger, I loved eating their fettuccine alfredo with sun-dried tomatoes and chicken. I don't really like it anymore now. The emulsion from the alfredo sauce would separate and I would get a nasty, deep yellow oil resting at the bottom of my to-go box when I would go to reheat my leftover. Service was fine. Host and waitress couldn't have done a better job. I just wasn't impressed with the food. Neither was my cousin. We both liked the fried macaroni and cheese balls, but everything else about our dishes just didn't have much of a taste. Maybe I should try another dish the next time I come to another The Cheesecake Factory, but I don't think I want to anymore. Another thing was that their cheesecakes leave a nasty ""chemical"" burped up aftertaste. Like the Red Velvet cheesecake tasted good, but after a while, you get tired of eating it all since the ingredients taste so dull from the overload of ingredients added on. It's as if everything is filled with processed stuff like preservatives to keep the flavor present. They even removed my favorite Oreo cheesecake and replaced it with a grosser version called the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. Ew. Drop the prices of the food to how they really taste, which is average.

Thankfully, it didn't take too long for the guy (Sean) to race back to the kitchen and place my order.

Marie R.,"Menlo Park, CA",13,2,,1.0,9/26/2016,"I went with my family to Cheesecake Factory for dinner this evening. Our dinner experience was so underwhelming, I cannot understand why people like this restaurant. To start, I checked in with the host stand and was told there would be 5-10 minutes wait. While we waited a number of parties were seated that had arrived after we did, but they were bigger parties and I wasn't worried. After three different parties the same size as ours were seated I went to check on how long our wait would be. Two different staff people checked the computer and the tables, and I was told that the computer showed we had already been seated, to which I replied that we were still waiting (right under their noses). After a few minutes of scrambling we were taken to a pair of empty tables that the hostess pushed together for us. Once we were seated our waiter was pleasant and competent. It took us a while to order, and even longer for our food to arrive. We started with the roasted artichoke, which was lovely. The beet salad with goat cheese was overly salty - who salts beets? My kids both ordered hamburgers which were adequate, though much too charred for their taste. My husband had the chicken Bellagio, which was tender but not particularly flavorful. He also had a side of asparagus, which consisted of six pieces of asparagus, which seemed skimpy. I had the Thai glazed salmon, which was served on a bed of rice with mixed vegetables. The salmon was moist and nicely cooked, but the glaze and the vegetables were so heavily salted they were pretty much inedible. The rice was completely bland, so I scraped as much of the glaze off as I could and just ate the salmon. I also ordered the ""oven-roasted broccoli"", which tasted like it was boiled and then tossed with some cooked garlic - there was nothing roasted about it at all. I know that I've mentioned the overly salty problem a couple of times, so I think it's worth mentioning that I don't have a problem with salty food, but most of my food was so heavily over-salted that it was really unpleasant. The ambience is noisy, the overall service is nothing great, the food is not very good, and the prices are much too high.

Jessica Y.,"Palo Alto, CA",88,201,647,3.0,7/20/2015,"I've been to this chain in various states before, and I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory in general. However, this particular location has slow service and somewhat long waits. We came around 7:45 pm for a double date and waited about 20 mins before being seated.  Ambiance is intimate, but somewhat loud. They always provide bread with your meal- I really like the darker honey wheat bread. Menu is extensive, which can sometimes be problematic if you are indecisive like me lol I ended up ordering steak medallions on the skinny menu (Cheesecake Factory is know to be highly caloric). Steak was tender and decently seasoned. Mashed potatoes were totally lacking though- it was more like a thin layer at the center of the plate under the steak. I was able to finish my portion, but most of their entrees tend to be very large. I think they basically downsize the meal to fit their calorie limit on the skinny menu. We ordered artichoke dip to share, but it never came. Apparently, they ran out of artichoke dip and our server forgot to notify us. We got a blueberry cheesecake to share. The cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory is perfect every time-definitely save room for dessert if you come here :D Parking in downtown PA can be a bit problematic, so you might need to park a few blocks down to get spot.

Colleen K.,"Menlo Park, CA",188,54,71,2.0,6/12/2015,"The venue itself is beautiful, Cheese Cake Factory restaurants are always very clean and elegant, but there is a few issues.  First, the lighting. It is way too dim! So dark it is actually hard to read the menu. So that part annoying.  Secondly, the food is always too salty or over seasoned. It's sort of a hit or miss type restaurant with what you order sometimes it's good sometimes you think you won't be coming back.  To not only nah on Cheesecake Factory, there are se highlights to eating here. Large and noisy crews can dine here as it is a loud place. It's family friendly. The drinks (alcoholic) are strong.

Linda T.,"San Francisco, CA",6,49,77,1.0,12/17/2014,"----------------------------This review is for the Bakery Dept. only-------------------------------- Very unprofessional, incompetent, irresponsible staff. I called few days ahead to see if I can order/reserve a Lemoncello Cream Torte whole cake for , the staff said there was no need to order/reserve, they have it in stock. NOTE: I was not offered the option to order/reserve in advance even when I requested to reserve for one. When I went into the store to get the cake and asked if they can write a Happy Birthday sign, the cashier said: Sure. So I paid the cake at 2:32PM and did not get my order ready until 3:05PM. The following happened during the 30+ minutes of waiting: The chocolate plate sitting on the table untouched while the two staff started chatting, joking, fooling around...(The restaurant was practically empty) Then a lady started writing something on the plate but something went wrong so the guy started wiping off the writing with a wet rag.... The guy tried again using the same chocolate plate and quickly slid the sign inside my plastic bag so I wouldn't notice it. I took a glance at it and almost died of horror...the writing was worse than a 5 year old! I told him this was unacceptable; His response/excuse: ""You know, it's really hard to write this""  Really? That's your lame excuse? All the bakeries can write, but it's too hard for you? I don't mind waiting for 30 mins. if the final product is acceptable, but to wait 30 min. for a 5 year old's writing? that's absolutely unacceptable. The manager then came out to apologize and his excuse was that it takes a long time to write the sign and that I should have called to pre-order. I told him that I did called to to reserve but no one offered to take my order.  Either the staff was not properly trained by the management or they don't care/appreciate having a job.

However, today was a very special day for my brother since he graduated from high school we decided we would go to The Cheesecake Factory. The wait to be seated was only ten minutes, not so bad. However, after we were seated and all 7 of us had decided what we wanted to eat we continued to wait....and wait....and wait...34 minutes later we noticed another table of 7 was seated and right away attended and another table party of one was also attended right away. We sat with no water, bread or server. So I finally got upset and went to the front desk to figure out what the issue was. Of course, once I stood up FINALLY Someone noticed I was very upset, they brought water and bread to my table. However, no one asked us if we were ready to order, so we had to FLAG down a server and he finally attended us. He was very nice but the wait, the lack of attention and even the lack of customer service didn't really make this experience at The Cheesecake Factory worth coming back.

We came in literally at 8pm on a Thursday and there was a 30 minute wait. Because we were desperate, we decided to stay.  We were finally seated, and the service was automatically horrible. We were a party of six girls in our 20s--I do admit that some of the guests at my party were being obnoxious, but I think it was more in retaliation to the ""off-the-bat"" rudeness of our server. I wasn't even given a napkin with my silverware. Attention to detail, people! Finally, the food was horrible. Between the 6 of us, not a single dish was appreciable. The vegetarians at the table got: Evelyn's pasta which was bland and undercooked, spinach and artichoke dip which, again was bland and the chips were thick and oily. Not restaurant style like we hoped for. Lastly, the pear and blue cheese flatbread. Flavor-wise it was good, but it came sliced once, and we asked them if they could take it back and slice it again, and we were met with a rude ""It was sliced in the kitchen"" by our server. Lastly, we got NO water refills after having asked repeatedly. As for the ambiance, after dinner, I felt so uncomfortable and claustrophobic that I had to leave the party early and go outside for fresh air.

Sable S.,"East Palo Alto, CA",14,24,46,5.0,5/12/2015,"Background: I was craving their cheesecake and I've been many times on the east coast. I was a solo diner. Experience: I went on a Saturday evening around 7:30. The hostess seemed a little busy handling other things while 2 small groups were waiting in front of me. She finally addressed them and then when I was next in line she walked away. She came back a few minutes later and I asked if I could sit at the bar (I probably could have jus walked to the bar without notifying her, but that felt weird). I sat at the bar and the bartender quickly gave me a menu. I ordered a cosmopolitan (they are also amazing at the Cheesecake Factory). The bartender made it satisfactory.  Food: I ordered the chicken potstickers and the Macaroni and cheese. For dessert I had the low carb cheesecake with strawberries. All the food was amazing and the low carb cheesecake almost tasted like the real thing.  The two male bartenders were great! However, there was a female server who could not stop cursing for the life of her (I mean I curse but not at work!). The male bartender realized how loud she was speaking and told her to keep it down, but she didn't. Overall my experience was just as amazing as the food! I will definitely return.

Our food finally arrived after 30 min or so but during that wait our waitress didn't stop by to ask if we wanted more bread or inform us how much longer it would be. Our food finally arrived & our waitress continued to be inattentive so although I enjoyed the food, service not so much. When we were done with our meals and desserts it took maybe 20-30 min before we saw her again to request the bill. So, I realized that the reason people are often waiting so long to get seated may be because of the delay the waiters/waitresses take to provide customers with their bills to get them going, so that the next patrons can be seated in a more timely manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=240

Yun C.,"Palo Alto, CA",402,679,1050,5.0,6/20/2013,"Seriously, ""cheesecakes,"" what not to love???!!! Ok, FIVE STARS definitely for their CHEESECAKES!!! as I never had any cheesecake that I don't like from the Cheesecake Factory :). Came here last night with 25+ people for a birthday celebration. The servers were super nice and very accommodating. I never wait tables BUT I'm sure it was quite a challenge to serve such a large group!  We got two servers but the male server (don't know his name) who was in charge of my section was SUPER NICE and ATTENTIVE. He's either a latino or filipino (dark hair, dark skin) wearing glasses. I ordered my water with no ice and when the water arrived it had ice in it. I didn't want to make a fuss about it and didn't complain but when he noticed my water with ice, he quickly said, ""let me grab a new glass of water with no ice in it."" WOW, with such a crowd, I must say that I was impressed that he remembered! I was trying to be ""good"" so that I would feel less guilty devouring on cheesecake for dessert so I opted for the Mexican Lettuce Wrap from the Skinnilicious menu (less than 490 calories). I must say that I was very impress with the freshness and the flavor. $6.96 for three fairly large lettuce wraps with large (generous size) chunks of chicken, avocado, tomatoes and other fixings. The chicken was flavorful and seasoned well. The tomatoes and avocado added moisture to the white chicken pieces so they didn't feel too dry (the common issue of white meat!). I must say that for a person with a LARGE stomach, the portion was pretty good to fill me up despite the no-carb on the plate. I did devour three slices of the ""free"" bread with butter before hand though, so maybe that helped ahhahahahaha!!! For dessert, I opted for the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake and I was EXTREMELY HAPPY with my choice! The cheesecake was delicious!!! It wasn't too sweet but yet rich and creamy, the way $7.95/slice should be huahauhauhauh! The edges of the cheesecake had crunchy chocolate chunks that added that extra texture, yummmmmm!!! I licked my plate clean, literally!!!!! and yes, I finished the whole piece by myself (well a couple of my friends sampled my piece but I also sampled theirs, so I think it evens out!). The best thing of all was that the whole meal (my portion) including tax and gratuity was $20 which is nearly unheard of when dining with a large crowd in a nice restaurant in downtown PA! Another gf  (she didn't have cheesecake), only spent less than $15!!! wow! Well, we both did order from the ""appetizer"" section so that kinda helped our pocket...but we were full at the end of the meal!!

Christina L.,"Palo Alto, CA",71,134,350,3.0,8/23/2014,"In all honesty, CF is a very dependable establishment for any casual date or family meal. The bread is usually warm, and the selection of entrees is good and plentiful. Just beware that everything here (drinks and dishes) is sweetened to downplay their overtly sweet desserts. This particular location is a smaller version of what you'll find at Westfield Valley Fair.   On our last visit, we arrived in dusty, sweaty hiking gear. We had just clambered up Mission Peak, and were in dire need of beverage and sustenance. There was absolutely no judgment on the servers' parts about how we were dressed. Should you find yourself in a similar post-exercise stupor, I highly recommend the Georgia Peach as a starter.  Service is always attentive, particularly when we sit at the bar. On a late weekend afternoon, the bar is usually empty. This is where you can find Justin, a rockstar bartender and server. We usually start with drinks and dessert before making it to the savory dishes.  Appetizers of note: crispy crab wontons, guacamole made-to-order (lemony fresh with a side of pico de gallo), and the fried calamari.  Standard entrees: grilled pork chops, fresh grilled salmon, and miso salmon. Just be careful not to burn your entire mouth like I did on the miso salmon. That sucker must have been sleeping under a salamander broiler, as it was still smoking after I had taken three very well-spaced bites. Warning next time, please and thank you?  Desserts, hers and his: chocolate tower truffle cake, lemon raspberry cream cheesecake, and fresh banana cream cheesecake. What's your poison? Note that this location always has the AC on full blast.

This made me compelled to write a yelp review (which I never usually do). Arrived at 9 pm on a not so busy Monday night.  1. Had to ask for Bread, burnt bread was given to us. Never got offered bread again. 2. We ordered 4 dishes to be brought out at the same time for 4 people: 2 were brought out after 25 minutes (that's great), then we wait 45 minutes and had to remind someone we had additional orders so they then bring the third dish out. After 1 hour we ask where our 4th dish is and the waiter forgot we ordered it, went to the kitchen and then came back 20 minutes later to tell us they forgot to cook it, asking if we still want it without any apology???! We were 4 hungry people so obviously said yes- it took another 30 minutes to bring it out. 3. By this time we asked 2 people if we could speak to the manager- both disappear and don't come back. It took the MANAGER 45 minutes to come and talk to us, not really apologizing. She said she would go to the kitchen, find out what happened and come back. No sign of her for 25 minutes! Go to the front desk to find someone to talk to since our waiter basically doesn't do his job, and she is at the bar!! 4. They give us the check which has an item on there we didn't even order!

Lillian Z.,"Sacramento, CA",463,371,1431,4.0,3/3/2012,"I've eaten at quite a few Cheesecake Factories, but this location was my very first one, and in all the years since my first visit, it hasn't changed much... but in a good way! This location gets really busy at night, but when I went here for lunch recently, it was surprisingly empty, which was a nice change. Whereas in the evenings, it's difficult to flag down your server and get his attention, at lunch, our server was super attentive (and friendly and not stressed out!) I looove the miso salmon. My roommate recommended it to me on one trip, and I've been enjoying it ever since. The flavor of the salmon is delicious-- just the right amount of sweet, without being too overwhelming. I've also always been a fan of their pastas-- I'm pretty sure I've tried almost every single one on the menu-- and have never been disappointed. I tried the cajun jambalaya pasta on a whim once, but it is so good! And when they say SPICY, they're not lying. I'm also really partial to the bread they serve here, especially the dark brown variety, which my friend once thought was ""chocolate bread"" (sadly, no...) The passion fruit mojito is also quite yummy. Of course, the cheesecake here is fantastic, but I usually am so full by the time dessert comes around that I either pass, or take the cheesecake to go! tl;dr: Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory-- all with similar looks and tastes, but that won't stop me from coming here whenever I crave that miso salmon!

On my most recent visit, we arrived around 10pm for a late dinner and were seated right away in the bar area. Our server took about 10 minutes to ask what we wanted to drink and took another 15 minutes to bring out our water at which time she finally took our order. She was slow at waiting on all of the tables in her area and was forgetting to bring straws, drinks, boxes for leftovers, but of course she didn't forget to bring the check accompanied with an insincere smile in hopes of getting a decent tip. Nuh-uh! At around 10:45, we finally received our order. The fries that came out with the chorizo omelet were stale and cold and my chicken lettuce wrap tacos didn't have the avocado cream that was supposed to make it more flavorful. For about 15 minutes our waitress disappeared and I couldn't wait that long to ask if she could please bring a side of the avocado cream. I decided to eat my bland food because I was already starving and couldn't wait any longer. Not once did our waitress check to see how everything at our table was. We had to ask another waitress to refill our waters because ours was nowhere to be found. Once we finished our meal, I had to walk up to the bartender to ask for a box for my leftovers. He asked another server to bring one, but that took another 10 minutes. Our waitress reappeared so we finally asked for our check. She finally asked how everything was and we told her about the fries. She said, ""Oh, I'm so sorry! Would you like me to bring you a new one?"" Ummm no but if you had cared to ask about 25 minutes earlier how we were doing it would have meant more. She never asked if we wanted to get dessert, which we originally did but lost our craving for cheesecake when their service was so poor. Overall, she was not warm and friendly, offered slow service, and did not follow up with any of the tables in her area. I thought I saw a manager walk by, but he didn't seem to pay attention to the row of tables that were suffering from our slow server.

This particular trip changed that. My boyfriend and I were walking down University Ave around 10:45 p.m. and EVERYTHING was closing down so we grudgingly walked to The Cheesecake Factory. Thankfully, we were seated immediately and had two very friendly, attentive waiters take care of us.  We initially wanted spinach dip and they were out. The waiter suggested crab cakes. Their crab cakes? AMAZING. I'd never pin them as having spectacular crab cakes, but they were delicious. They melted in your mouth, but we're breaded to perfection. The cakes were plated beautifully (too distracted by their deliciousness to take a picture) and the two dipping sauces that came with the crab cakes (one cold, one warm, both some sort of tartar) were dutifully cleaned up by us with bread. My only critique is that there were only three.  So if you're walking down University Ave around 11 and want a place to sit and eat, go here for the crab cakes.

We received three dishes, all of which had problems (one was cold, one was burned, one was overdone to the point of infinite chewing). We then visited dirty bathrooms. The women's room was a particular menace; it smelled so strongly of puke that most people in there were trying not to ... puke.

Food should be ok, you wouldn't expect it to bring you to cloud 9.  Yet, this resto managed to not deliver on all of that. It's in a nice location in Palo Alto, and from outside it looks inviting. Once you come in, you get a wiff of mediocrity.  ...supported by service and food.  Service was spotty. Somehow it was difficult for the server to give us full attn to understand what we wanted.  The good - greasy and way too heavy. Yes, you wouldn't expect this place to give you the most healthful options, but our scallops felt like they were cooks in 3-day-old oil, and artichoke dip was reheated 4 times.

Suzanne N.,"Palo Alto, CA",10,41,16,1.0,11/22/2013,"This review isn't for the food, it's for the to-go service: It's kind of interesting to see how operations work when they first open in the morning. While I appreciate friendliness between coworkers, I don't appreciate the unprofessional yelling in the lobby by Ana, a cashier in the bakery, to what I assume is her manager, Christian, and she was constantly yelling across the lobby at him all the while sipping on a Starbucks frappucino. I was a bit disgusted that this cashier did not have her hair tied back, simply a hat on her head. Her hair was long enough to pull back, and I am a bit afraid of finding a hair in my dessert. Placed a over the phone order around 10:30. I have now been waiting... 30 minutes for it. I wish I would have been told over the phone about the long wait upon walking in. I would have made other plans instead of sitting here in the lobby the entire tip.  Star to the hostess who acknowledged me and offered me a drink. I had to turn it down, but I do appreciate her effort. What I don't appreciate is pretty much being ignored in the lobby until I went up to ask about how much longer the wait time would be. Apparently, the man behind the counter now was a manger or some sort of leadership and he went ahead at explained that they are boxing my order up now. That was 10 minutes ago. If this was my order alone, I would have for sure cancelled my order. Overall: When placing to-go orders from here, place well in advance and show up at least 30 minutes after they tell you to.

Celeste G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,13,,2.0,5/24/2016,"So, i live in San Mateo and frequent the Hillsdale location, this was definitely an isolated visit and it will remain that way for a very long time unless we happen to encounter a similar situation as we did yesterday, in which case, I will try my best not to go here at all. My sister and brother in law spent the day at Stanford Hospital with my little niece who has recently been ill. Thankfully, she is on the mend but it gave us all quite a fright. They live in the central coast and since we are only 15 min away, we offered to meet them for dinner after work, they were both very tired from a long day and hungry but didn't want fast food. I told them we would head down and get a table and they could meet us there, hopefully we would have their food ready and waiting for them. So we get there at a quarter to 7, I put my name down for a table for 5 and the hostess says, give me 15 minutes.. ok not a problem as my sister and fam were still at the hospital. 30 mins later, a second hostess walks over and asks me if my whole party is here yet as she needs half of us to be here before she can seat us. I explained to her the situation and asked if that would be possible, she said ok and that she'd see what she can do. At this point, we are the only ones waiting for a table. In walks a group of 4 people, they get seated immediately, in walks another group of 3 and they get seated immediately. At this point, I am extremely irritated, if she couldn't do it, then she should say so and we can have the choice of going to a different restaurant. AS soon as I get up to go ask her again, my sister and brother in law walk in, I tell her my party is here and she walks away, the first hostess I encountered tells me she will have us seated in 2 mins. So by now, my family is here, they are tired and hungry and again, we are waiting. I was disappointed with the experience that my food didn't even taste good. I don't feel this was an unreasonable request as it was a monday evening and there was no wait time, plus, I was ready to order food for all of us at the same time. If it weren't for the fact that I didn't want to inconvenience my family and have them wait to eat any longer, we would have definitely left and eaten elsewhere. To top it off, my husband ordered the Shrimp Scampi and the shrimp tasted as tho there was uncooked batter on it, he was actually pretty sick last night and this morning. The only reason I am giving this place any stars is because yelp makes you give at least one, the other one is for the waiter who was kind and patient with us.

Seriously, if you have not tried them yet -- what are you waiting for? They will rock your socks, and impress any date :) For dinner or lunch tho, go someplace else. These guys are famous for the cheesecake, and the food they make is a-ok, nothing spectacular. Your typical American cuisine (variety of choices, deep deep fried stuff, giant salads that with dressing make up to 1200 cal., etc.). I have been a few times throughout California. Same everywhere.  But, I keep coming back for more -- cheesecake that is! yum yum yum :) P.S.: I have ordered the cheesecakes for a special occasion from Palo Alto Cheesecake Factory and my experience was awful. So just a heads up, give them a call the week before, the day before and on the day off. Which is EXACTLY what I have done (I figured since I placed my order a few months ahead of time it would be smart to refresh).

Stephy L.,"Millbrae, CA",813,199,616,4.0,7/29/2011,"Beware! This review is mainly for their desserts!! Took a day trip and visited Santana Row with my boyfriend.  We were bringing a friend from Taiwan around.  We had a late lunch at Yard House ( needless to say, review coming soon!), so by the end of the night, we decided to skip dinner and just go for desserts at Cheesecake Factory. Thursday night, it wasn't as bad as I thought in finding parking.  Surprisingly there was no line at the Cheesecake Factory.  We arrived around 8pm ish and was immediately seated.  The restaurant was about 70% full.  Not bad for a Thursday night! My friend went traditional and ordered the Original cheesecake with strawberries on top.  The cake size was decent.  The cheesecake was great. it wasn't too heavy, and the taste was just right.  The texture was rather fluffy. I decided to try out their Tropical smoothie, which was absolutely refreshing and delicious.    I think this smoothie itself would served as a great dessert/after dinner drink.  I find this very enjoyable.  It wasn't sour in any way, but it wasn't too sweet either.  All i can say is, it was very tropical. I also ordered the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake which looks like this :    it was a GIANT piece of cheesecake. I was so excited when I saw this! ( the fact that i've been craving red velvet in forever).  Now, personally I thought the cake itself was only okay, but the cream cheese in between the layers definitely made up for it.  I thought the ratio between cake and cheesecake were a bit extreme.  The cake would simply be perfect if there was more cake to it.  The very top layer was cream frosting.  By the time I killed half of it, i was stuffed and didn't want to continue because it was getting too sweet and too much cream cheese.  But the cake itself is overall very enjoyable.  However, if you eat just the red velvet cake parts, it doesn't taste as rich and creamy. For $ 25 w/tip, we all left feeling content.  Our waitress Lisa was definitely helpful and very sweet.  Thanks for making our friend's first Cheesecake Factory experience a great one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=340

I don't care how much money you are capable of spending, it's still a chain restaurant. Just like Red Robin or Elephant Bar. CHECK YOUR SILVERWARE AS YOU ARE SEATED.  The cheesecakes and desserts, while they are sure to take a few years off of your lifespan, deserve five stars themselves.  Most entrees I've tried other than the wasabi crusted tuna and the pit beef sandwich (my go-to orders that never fail to satisfy me, and thus earn themselves a five star rating as well) garner three and a half stars at best.

Fred T.,"Palo Alto, CA",454,285,1832,2.0,1/16/2012,"Ah the Cheesecake factory. Ive always thought of them as a solid 3-4 star kind of place. Its kind of like going to PF Chang's: You have a general idea of what you are going to get no matter where you happen to be and they have such a huge menu that you can cover even picky eaters (more on that in a bit), and they do vary a bit from place to place but don't really stray too far from the baseline.  That being said the last two times here we have come away very unhappy with the food. As always the service is great and the atmosphere / acoustics are fantastic for a chain restaurant, but their expansive menu seems to be having a negative impact on quality and whoever is running the pass is not paying attention to the details. Todays late lunch was a case in point:  The Apps:  Buffalo Blasts: A must order IMHO. Crispy deep fried wontons filled with shredded buffalo chicken are to die for. Not today. They verged on the overcooked and at least 3 were not sealed so the filling was greasy and overcooked. That however was only the beginning.  Thai Chicken Wraps: Another must order for us. Sometimes my wife will get this as her main. The build your own platter is tasty and fun. However, today it looks like we got the lettuce discards with nice large brown slimy areas on the stems. They were replaced quickly but come on.  Mains:  Hickory Burger: Not cooked as I ordered it. There is a big difference between the rare I asked for and Medium well. Also the onion rings were absent. I mentioned the missing items and it was fixed quickly. I did not bother asking the burger to be redone. After tasting the meat, perhaps it was for the best as it had an off taste. I expect better quality meat at this range of restaurant. The top fries were pretty good but the ones in the bottom were undercooked and had that greasy translucent look to them.  Salmon: Salmon was a generous portion and properly cooked. It was off the lunch menu and was a pretty good deal.  Kids Chicken Tenders: Batter dipped and looked really good. BUT, if you are going to pre-fill the cup the ranch goes it, give it a stir so you customers don't notice the brownish skin that has developed over the little cup. Better yet lets say you fill it to order.  Heck no we did not want desert.  All and all its been back to back issues here. None of these items is a big deal but coupled together its a big issue. Also after the lettuce issue I would expect the dishes comming out to get closer scrutiny. As I said I think the menu is simply too big for any kitchen to keep tabs and quality control is a must. It kills these places long term. I for one will not be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=340

Adrian L.,"Redwood City, CA",0,24,,1.0,3/9/2014,"Dogs. I took my kids to this restaurant for a late lunch.  We arrived at 1:40 to miss the crowds.  The food did not arrive until 2:50.  Bad enough. Meanwhile, at 2:30 a couple in their twenties arrived and sat at a table with a pit bull puppy at their feet.  This was a violation of the California health code, which says that pets can only be allowed at restaurants that are outside and cannot be taken through a closed restaurant to an outside area.  Even worse, several of the waiters and waitresses--including ours--stopped to pet the animal with their bare hands, which of course they also used when delivering the food.  That, too, is against the law. This matters to us because my daughter is extremely allergic to dogs and has asthma attacks even when she walks into a room that a dog has recently been in.  For her, this is a matter of life or death, and we did not have an epipen with us.   Needless to say, we walked out when we saw our waitress playing with the dog as she brought our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=360

First up was the Provenance Merlot and the Firecracker Salmon Rolls.  The Merlot was tasty, but steeply priced at $11/glass.  Personally, there were better wines on the menu for less.  The Firecrackers Salmon Rolls were delicious (as always) and they were gobbled up quickly.

Daisy Z.,"Stanford, CA",75,104,264,4.0,9/12/2013,"I think the Cheesecake Factory gets a bad rep just for being a chain restaurant. That being said, I thought about how I would rate this place had it been called something else and that's how I'm writing my review. The food here varies in quality by what you order. Pasta, of course, always comes in large portions here though the quality is just okay. I feel the pizza is the best thing to order at Cheesecake Factory and I have never been let down by it. My friend got the Steak Diane and it might have been the most delicious thing on that table. I came close to closing time and the service was amazing. The waiter was very attentive and didn't try to rush out my large group when it was closing time. The ambiance is really nice and this one has beautiful decorations though I feel is was a little too dimly lit for people to be able to tell. I had trouble reading my menu. That means it was too dark. Cheesecake gets its own category because, duh, that's why I came. I got the Oreo Cheesecake and it might be the better than the Godiva one! All-in-all Cheesecake Factory is solid every time. I think its success is its own worst enemy because it's a chain but honestly, if there was only one of these, which offered gorgeous ambiance, super large portions, and a 2-page cheesecake menu, then I'd drive an hour for this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=300

I came to the Cheesecake factory as part of a group holiday lunch.  The ambiance is admittedly pretty stunning (Art Deco -meets- Aladdin -meets- Vegas), and it felt like a good pick to go for a festive meal with coworkers.  I also appreciated the wide variety of dishes offered on the menu.  But that's pretty much where it ended. I found the food to be below average and prices to be a bit high. After scanning the menu, I still felt like something basic, so I ordered the Kobe beef burger with sweet potato fries.  It did not meet my expectations: -- The beef was cooked well-done, though I had requested medium-rare -- Beef quality didn't seem like Kobe (or even an American version of Kobe) -- Cost of $13 is higher than most places in the bay area (price not incl. extra $ for sweet potato fries). At the end of our meal I polled my co-workers around the table; Nobody was ecstatic; In fact, everyone used the words ""OK"" or ""fine."" When the waiter asked if they wanted to take leftovers home, most declined. Your honor...I rest my case. Some people in the group opted for dessert but I went straight for the coffee (Disclaimer: I don't like cheesecake) In short, this is a fine choice if: - You're not that much of a ""foodie"", or - You're dining with kids, or - Decor and cheesecake are a big deal to you For me, 2 stars for the food, one more for the decor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=380

Ruth C.,"Mountain View, CA",475,480,245,3.0,1/22/2009,"I've been here a few times and definitely agree that service can be hit or miss.  I think it all depends on the waiter you get which says a lot.  Whether it is busy or incredibly empty, a good waiter will show his true self. One thing on the menu that I've gotten repeatedly is the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  It's always quite delicious and filling.  Lots of leftovers.  Could easily be shared with 3 people. I also have enjoyed the mango daiquiri.  Tastes just like a fruit smoothie! Now... what's with the names of some of the dishes?? Rapunzel fun burger (inside joke).. I believe the actual name is called the ""Tons of Fun"" burger... which my friend informed me was very much like a Big Mac (look and taste).  The fries that accompany it are pretty good, but a little salty. Another fun name to a dish - Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  Fun to say and probably fun to eat and recall later! One thing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't do well is spicy so don't come looking for it here. As for the cheesecakes?  My favorite is the raspberry lemon.  I can finish a slice with no problem.  It's light and the tartness of the raspberry does a really good job cutting the creaminess of the cheesecake. If you've never been to Cheesecake, I would highly recommend you do at least once.  It is an experience in itself to browse the huge book of a menu and get giddy over the cheesecake selection.  As a bonus, if it's your birthday, you can get a free slice of cheesecake and of course singing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=380

Hurnan V.,"Riverside, CA",519,253,215,4.0,3/12/2014,"This chain is one of my favorite go-to places when I am a) super hungry or b) going with a larger group of friends -- their portions are SO gigantic! Located in downtown Palo Alto, this Cheesecake Factory is surprisingly spacious inside, unlike the other restaurants in the area. The last time I was here, I was ravenous (per usual), and ordered a full size The Everything pizza and the Luau salad for my sister and me to share. The Luau salad was like a mountain and very fresh, lots of variety; my only issue with it is that they definitely piled on too much dressing. The bottom of the plate was practically a mini pool. Then, the waiter confused our order and thought we had ordered a half pizza; they quickly put in another order of a half (which they ended up burning). So, after that whole debacle, my sister and I received only the half, but that was enough for two, and we even took the left overs to go. Bottom line: expect gigantic portions of food, drenched with oil/grease/dressing -- but space yourself for the cheesecake! This is overall a great place for a nice sit down meal to really fill up your stomach.

I've been here countless times, with no issues and I must say today's was the worst experience we've had there.  There were 4 of us and the bad incident happened to my ""lil sis"". So she had her tooth extracted a week ago and has been on a liquid diet since and slowly getting back to eating solids and was excited to try something different off the menu. She ordered the Lemon Herb Roast Chicken and when it was served to her, one of the pieces had blood on it. The waiter took the dish away and said they would fix it but when it came back out again the second time, you could see that the chicken was pretty much burnt on the outside. She cut into one of the pieces and as she got closer to the inside, more chicken blood appeared!!! Poor girl was so traumatized!! The waiter took it away and she decided to order the Jambalaya instead.  The rest of us, by that time, had already finished our meals when her Jambalaya Pasta came out so she had them pack it to go since we were already late getting back to work. My two other friends ordered Pork Chops and they were extremely overcooked and dry. One of them had trouble even cutting into the meat without the plate moving all over the table. My dish was the Eggplant Sandwich and there were gigantic slices of red onion that were barely grilled and the taste was so strong. I love onions but that was a little OTT. When the check finally arrived, they didn't even comp lil sis' pasta!! It wasn't until the manager came to our table to ask how everything was and she told him she hasn't eaten yet that he offered to take it off the bill. Shouldn't that have already been done before the waiter gave the check to us?!?!? See, it's the little things like that which makes a huge difference.

He ignored us pretty much the whole time we were there and at the end he charged my friends card 3 times for different amounts. He then said that we told him to charge it like that. No clue why anyone would ask to be charged 3 separate times in different amounts but ok. After he fixed it he came back with like 12 receipts and said the transactions would be adjusted right away. C'mon dude, we weren't born in the stone age.. we know how this works. It's gonna take a few days. Not a problem. Before he walked away he made sure to tell us that gratuity was NOT included and we MUST leave at least 15%, the percentages are on the bottom of the bill.

We started off with some ice water and bread and butter.  They had two types; one was dark multi-grain bread and another like a baguette.  They both taste good but I preferred the darker multi-grain bread. For our entree, ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and a new item menu called the Chicken Bellagio.  The portions are not too big, but if you eat a lot of the bread you may not end up finishing your meal.  I think if you order appetizer as well, definitely will not finish you entree. The Jambalaya Pasta was requested to be not spicy, but at the end it was still a bit spicy and the server did guarantee it was not spicy and was able to substitute it.  The noodles taste a bit over cooked and the shrimp was not crispy / crunchy.  The chicken was good and the sauce was good as well. The chicken Bellagio was delicious with its basil pesto sauce noodles with bread chicken breast.  The noodles were al dente and the fried chicken breast in bread Crum was crispy and the chicken was tender. I preferred the Chicken Bellagio more and would like to try something else next time.  Everything on the menu sounds really good, and nothing really wowed me.   Overall, they have a large selection of everything to choose and they specialize in their cheesecakes.  Warning though, every item on the menu is really high in calories.  The service was really alright, sometimes the server is not available.

Not that many restaurants are open past 10pm on a Wednesday night here so ultimately we limited it down to this place.  Very typical Cheesecake Factory. The waitress was fairly attentive and nice.  We ordered the following (might not have the names down 100% but should be close enough):  1) Dynamite Shrimp Tempura ( ) I'm not sure if it's because this was the first item that showed up but I thought this was awesome. I'd come back for this again. The tempura had the perfect level of crisp and the dipping sauce was delish  2) Thai Noodle Salad ( ) Again... great job cheesecake factory  3) Garlic Noodle - with Chicken ( )  As you can see from my other reviews, I really like garlic. Unfortunately, this one I won't be ordering again. The noodles were bland as was the chicken.  On top of that, the chicken meat was quite dry... 4) Blue-cheese Bacon Burger ( ) Friend ordered this. Not sure what it tastes like but he said it was awesome. 5) Strawberry cheesecake ( ), Reese's peanut butter cheesecake ( ). Both were great. My favorite here however is the carrot cake. MMMmmmmm I gave this place 3 stars because it is the ordinary run of the mill cheesecake factory.  But the bathroom needs to be cleaned on some sort of schedule.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=440

I came earlier and it was the right thing to do because it got really busy, actually, I had to check at 630 pm to get the table around 8 pm! I can't believe there was an hour and half wait to eat at this restaurant. The food was simply amazing, the prices are ok, they are not cheap for this kind of restaurant but still not too bad. I had a small cesar salad and then Chicken Marsala. They were both good, especially the chicken. For dessert we had strawberry shortcake. The staff are extremely helpful and very kind.

No reservation ready yet, we can put u on the list now for your party of 20.  so not only did we have to wait 1 hour when we got there early, we had to wait another 1 before we even got seated.  We were so close to walking out to the restaurant down the street.   When it came to the food, it was meh...nothing to fancy about.  A few of the other ppls dishes were either over cooked salmon or too dry steaks.  Not really good reviews for the food.  They even miss fired on our entrees. 2 ppl in our party didn't get there food until 20 minutes later, when almost everyone at the table was done eating...really bad!  Not acceptable!  The plus of the night was that when I wanted a beer at the bar, I got my beer at the bar.  easy peasey.

Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,4.0,1/16/2010,"The wife was on a out shopping on a girls' day out, so it was just the kids mid week during the recent Saturday. Asked where they wanted to go, and they both said Cheesecake Factory. Typically, one can expect a long wait for a table at any CF location, but since we had no plans that day, we had time to wait. Also, I didn't want to drive up to SF or Santa Clara for a CF. Then I remembered there was one in Palo Alto, and since we haven't ate at this location yet, I figured we'd just head here.  After finding a parking spot, walked down a short block on University, and entered the through the large doors of the Cheesecake Factory. We saw the cheesecake displays on the right (yes, we were looking for them), and the front desk on left. I was expecting to see some people waiting up front, but surprisingly, there was hardly anyone. The host met us, and immediately seated us.  Waitperson immediately greeted us, then came back a few minutes later for our orders.  OUR ORDER:  -Kids bow tie pasta with butter and Parmesan: In typical CF portions, even the portions of the kid's plate was pretty big. Pasta was hot, and my daughter happy.  -Four-cheese Penne: My oldest was craving this, so she ordered the lunch-sized portion. Still pretty sizable. This pasta is made with mozzarella, Parmesan, Romano, and Ricotta (scooped on the side), in a marinara and basil sauce. Also arrived hot, with the cheese string and gooey with each forkful.  -Cuban Sandwich: A pork and ham sandwich, with Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard and mayo, on a roll, grilled until flat. Pork was a little on the dry side, but still tasty nonetheless.  Cheesecake? We'll make room for cheesecake. It was the real reason why the girls wanted to come here. No kid sized cheesecakes for my girls. They wanted the full size (yes, the are my girls).  -30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake ( ): Cheesecake layered between chocolate cake, with a very rich cream cheese frosting and chocolate cream. Woo this was rich, but so good.  -Oreo Cheesecake ( ): My daughter was happy.  I figured I would ""help"" them enjoy their cheesecakes, so I didn't order any for myself.  Cheesecake Factory restaurants are known for their huge quantities of food, and of course, their cheesecakes. Food is OK to pretty good, but the long waits for a table usually turn me off. I found this true for almost all CF I've dined around the country.  There was no wait at this location, and the servers were friendly and efficient. For these, I'd give this location another star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=440

My personal favorites are: Papas bravas Dynamite shrimp Spicy chicken chipotle pasta Garlic noodles (with shrimp) Also, I absolutely love their strawberry lemonade. It is just the right amount of fresh, tart, and sweet. More importantly, the refills are free! I have gotten up to six refills one Sunday afternoon when I ate alone here watching an episode of Archer on my laptop.

Tonight it was obvious that whatever cheese that had been on the sandwich was scraped off -- along with most of the buffalo sauce -- and a cold piece of cheddar was thrown on in its place. There was no accompanying bleu cheese. My wife's salad was not as ordered. My daughter's child pasta was lukewarm and rubbery. The server was friendly and apologetic, but the kitchen is awful.

Absolutely awful!! I would give them a zero if I could. I've been there 3 times in the past two months and all three times the exact same things happened.  You get greeted and taken to your table. Your server comes and asks for drinks and brings the drinks. Then disappears. Your bread comes ages later. They finally come to take your order. They get the order wrong, EVERY TIME! Then they correct it and before you have the chance to even taste the food, they ask how everything is. They keep coming by too many times during the first few minutes, even the manager comes to ask questions. It's so annoying! Can I eat my food that I waited so long for before it gets cold??!! But then they disappear again. Don't even think about refills or having the food boxed up when your done. You sit there forever till they come back. They bring the bill and you ask for the box. Your bill is ready but no one picks it up. After a long time they do. Then they come back 2 or 3 times apologizing for the wait, there's something wrong with... or they are waiting for... whatever!

Our waitress Lisa appeared within a couple of minutes, took our beverage order and gave us our menus while filling us in on the specials, the Skinnylicious menu, and the Happy Hour menu. She came back several times until we were ready to order (we were talking instead of looking at the menu), and she was always gracious and pleasant.  Our orders were brought out promptly by someone from the kitchen, and Lisa was right there with the parmesan grater for our meals (we both ordered pasta dishes). The food was outstanding! (Four Cheese Pasta and Farfalle Pasta, if you were wondering what we ordered). We both had ice water and she refilled our glasses frequently, a definite rarity in restaurants which was greatly appreciated. We never had to search for her - she took excellent care of us during the meal, and by the time she brought our to-go boxes and to-go cheesecake with the check, we had chatted with her enough that we felt like we were becoming fast friends.

The wait, as usual for a Cheesecake Factory, was long, but we stood outside so my stomach didn't have to eat itself imagining the taste of the nearby cheesecakes.  We were seated in a booth in the massive establishment and got ready to order. I was glad to see they came out with a new ""Skinnylicious"" menu that lists several of their regular entrees made in portions that humans were intended to consume.  I just wish they didn't give it a name that made you feel like such a tool for ordering from it. So instead I had the grilled portobella on a bun, with no cheese, and a green salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  The shroom was so delicious... can't go wrong with spicy mayonnaise, I feel!  And the side salad was good too, although they don't offer any low-fat or fat-free dressings, so even the balsamic vinaigrette was pretty creamy. Thankfully, I saved room for a slice of chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake for dessert.  I took it to go, which was an unnecessarily slow process.  And once again, Cheesecake Factory didn't fail to give me wayy too much whipped cream.  But I suppose that's forgiveable when they're responsible for such a blissful state of food-euphoria.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=420

We'd casually talked about going out for dinner somewhere, but both of us are such homebodies, and I was so into my photo editing that he finally got tired of waiting for me and ate a slice of pizza.  Well, around 9:30 I was finally done with my photos (for the day) and felt like we should do SOMETHING... but what can you do in Redwood City at 9:30? (If you live in Redwood City like we do, you know... there's almost nothing to do after 8:00... everything closes so early here!). I wasn't super hungry, but thought maybe we could go to Ihop or Denny's for dessert.  But... the thought of one of their microwaved pies or slices of cake to celebrate 3 years of marriage just didn't seem all that appealing.  On a whim I decided to see how late the Cheesecake factory is open. I used to work down the street and occasionally we'd pick up lunches from here (their luau salad is amazing). Lo and behold, I could not believe they are actually open till ELEVEN on Sunday nights! Bingo!!

I arrived at around 5PM and the restaurant was not busy at all. It was nice not having to deal with a long wait that is usually the signature of the Cheesecake Factory experience.  Our server, Jason, was fantastic. He was funny and very approachable.  We had a blended Margarita, the crab & artichoke dip, fried mac & cheese, and the hot spinach dip. I'm definitely not the best critic for alcoholic drinks, but the Margarita was okay to me. Heavy on the alcohol (which is a good thing, right?) with a good soury, fruity taste. Way worth it during happy hour.  Crab & artichoke dip and the fried mac & cheese are MUST-ORDERs. There's so much crab flavor in the dip. I could definitely just eat the dip by itself. The fried mac & cheese are just amazing too! Irresistible and pretty filling as an appetizer.  I would recommend against ordering the hot spinach dip unless you just really love spinach. Honestly, I didn't really even get slammed with the spinach flavor when I ate the dip. Maybe my taste buds were spoiled by the other flavorful items that I ordered, but the spinach dip was mediocre at best. The chips tasted better with the salsa and sour cream that the plate came with.  I will be coming back to happy hour here in the future. I'm just going to get smarter with what I end up ordering. Oh yeah, everything is $5 on their happy hour menu. What a steal!

John P.,"Palo Alto, CA",39,36,20,3.0,7/14/2014,"Came here for my nephew's graduation/birthday dinner. Fancy decor. Reminds you of being in Vegas at the Caesar's Palace. Prior to coming here I heard many people refer to the menu as the Bible, not because it has life lessons or anything inscribed in it, but because its such a long and cumbersome amount of food to choose from. The choices of food are not better than the other.  Here are the dishes that we ordered. Appetizers: FRESH KALE SALAD 5.95 - Fresh but so so. Something anyone can make at home. Comes with a ranch dressing mixed with blue cheese dressing. Would have preferred a vinaigrette instead.  PORTABELLA MUSHROOM, AVOCADO & ZUCCHINI FRIES 6.95 - Interesting how everyone wants to make everything into fries these days. These do not fly so well. Eat with caution, vegetables get hot when fried. The avocado one was interesting, however I would not order again FRIED CALAMARI 11.95 - Decent taste, good texture. Way too pricey. Don't know how the ones at Pier 39 do it. So good. Thats what I'm comparing it to. The portion appeared big but its not.  Main Course: JAMAICAN BLACK PEPPER SHRIMP 18.50 There were others but this was mine and the only one I ate. Meh. Shrimp is actually hard to make good unless thrown with some noodles like scampi or served plain as a cocktail. The plate came with black beans and the shrimp was mixed with some sort of cajun seasoning. Way too pricey for something that could have possibly been made with the cajun seasoning in the herb section of the grocery store. Mix some rice and shrimp and voila.  Service: White knights of the cheesecake factory. The men and women that serve here range from the 20s to upper 40s to 50s. We had three servers come to our table and one of them who brought the bread, an asian guy, said the one basket he gave us was all that was left so eat sparingly. Wth? Apparently he lied or had a terrible sense of humor because our main server, the tall blond brought us a few baskets later. Bread is raved to be really good here. Eh, not bad. Its called honey wheat bread, its a dark brown/black color. Can't really complain about the service.

Wait a minute, what time did we go to there? is 3 o'clock, with no customer, lots of empty table, and waiter and waitress were flirting each other? I was thinking about what's wrong with them, and I finally waved my hand to call for service. I totally understand is not a lunch hour or the waiter/waitress  not get too attention on the table.  Later on, the waitress keep asked ""is everything alright?' like five time within 2 hrs. Come on, I was having conversation, can you see that? With that kind of service, how can I willing to give more or extra tips to them?  Don't get wrong with me, we are not the only victims on my table section because they treat the same way to other table too.

Brandon C.,"Santa Clara, CA",194,78,46,1.0,5/21/2012,"No no no no no no no no no! on this place! I dare never touch my feet into this dump ever again! why I dare write a review for this place? why i dare even rate this as a one when it deserves to be gone? Thats a mystery to me too. Anyway let me tell you MY experience here..... Went here for dinner during the day of the eclipse, and as I walk into the restaurant with my family, I immediately walk up to the front desk. I stand there waiting for the greeter to finish taking her drink. I then proceeded to state my name. It takes her and 2 other waiters to find my name. This shows me that these employees are not the brightest leaf in the batch...either that or they have had one to many drinks that day. My name is finally found, and I walk to my seat. With a miracle, I somehow get a decent waitress! She asked my group how we were doing, and where we could find her if we needed her just in case. Every time I thanked her, she replied with a thank you back. This was the only good part of the night. I look at the menu, and I am struck with many kinds of heavy foods. Not that this is a problem or anything, (oh wait it is) its just that what would people who aren't looking for a heavy meal to eat? Even the portions on the salads are enough to sustain 2-3 people! Knowing from prior knowledge of eating at other factories closer to my home, I immediately knew where to look for a good dish.  I ended up getting their so called ""award winning"" famous portabella mushroom burger. And heres where the night drops..... Now, the rest of my family ordered other horrible and fattening foods, but none were as DISGUSTING, as this!  The hamburger was made from a gray garbage or also known as left over meat that was thrown into a food processor, pureed to a thin pulp, and formed into a patty. And to add insult to failure, the cook had made my well-done patty into a rare piece of crap!  I had NOT told the waitress about this horrible experience here, because I knew that ordering here again would be a vile mistake, and I didn't want her to be hurt if this were her favorite dish. Moreover, I also didn't want my family to get involved into something that only I was completely concerned about.  P.S.* It doesn't take a cook like me, to notice that a well done hamburger should be on the grill for more than just a quick 3 minutes! Also, if you are going to serve your crap from the counter to a guest? Next time make sure they like to eat crap. Because I sure don't. Ever.

My biggest problem took place the last time i will ever eat there- my boyfriend ordered pretzel chicken. He then ate 2 pieces and asked me if it looked ""weird""?  It was COMPLETELY pink and raw. Like COLD inside. It had clearly Just been dropped in the fryer, cooking the outside only. The manager didnt even offer to bring anything else! This place is in big trouble if they get a child or an elderly person ill. Its no joke.  It grossed ME out enough... And as i said... A menu of this size screams that the ingredients are not fresh.

The waitress was extremely slow and not only in action but as well as taking the order and understanding what we wanted. We asked for the Kentucky tea and the pineapple Moscow mule, both drinks are on the menu. When we ordered them she seemed very confused and repeated our drink order 3 different times then stated how she doesnt know much about cocktails since she takes shots. Ok, but both drinks are on the menu. We also ordered the crab dip, we waited over 40 mins for it to arrive. When the dip finally arrived it had a crust over it from clearly waiting too long under the heat lamp, gross. At this point i had lost my patience and asked a host to send a manager to my table. Trust me she wasnt much help either. She clearly didnt understand i wanted a new dip made and we waited another 15 mins for another round of drinks.

This particular location used to be my favorite because it offered a lovely stroll before and after, and quite frankly, the wait time was more decent than other locations. However, things have been changing here. I feel as if it's losing its class, and it begins with the reception desk. Not very friendly, looks annoyed, and takes awhile to look up from whatever it is she's doing. While my server was nice, the place is looking older and dirtier, and it takes awhile for the server to even get to you. I remember when the rule was they had to check in with you after your first bite. That didn't happen. And this would have to be my third time letting them know their women's restroom needed attendance. Toilet paper on the floor vs. on the roll...and it's everywhere.

Many guests for this party showed up at the last minute, so even though we reserved for 70, 92 showed up, but they were great at accommodating everyone. The brunch menu is great, large portions, so one entree and one drink fulfilled everyone. They could have prepared a bit better by staffing it with more people, as it took a while for us to order/get the food, and they ran out of french toast (when two options on the select menu involved french toast) so better planning could be done knowing that we had a large party.

Jenna F.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/31/2014,"I have been a patron of The Cheesecake Factory for about 10 years, which started in high school. Last Friday was the first time I was dissatisfied with the service, food and management.  It had been a while since dining at a Cheesecake Factory, so for my cousin's fairwell dinner, the six of us decided to eat here. We had two waiters, which in and of itself is odd considering we were only a six-top. The male waiter took our order.  We proceeded to have good conversation. then about 45 minutes after we ordered, the female waitress came by and said that it would be another 3-4 minutes because the kitchen was slammed (now I work in the food industry, so I understand when the kitchen gets busy). However when another 15-20 minutes passed without any food, we started wondering whether they forgot about our food. The manager even came by to apologize for the wait (which was good of her to check). When our food finally came and all of us received our dishes except for my boyfriend's, the waitress asked him if he ordered anything! It was appalling that she asked because she could have easily checked in the system. My boyfriend responded with a curt, ""Yes"" and she replied with ""Oh, I didn't take the order"" !!!  My boyfriend did get his food in the end. By this point neither of us want to eat. My uncle's food (he ordered the crusted salmon, which comes with some steak) was over cooked and tough (he had ordered medium rare). When I mentioned something to the waiter, he proceeded to take away the food, which meant my uncle had to wait even longer (though I admit, I may be partially to blame for his food being taken).  Finally, when we spoke to the manager about compensation for such a horrible meal, she only took 25% off the bill, without any voucher/discount to return to the restaurant. In the end, I blame the management for lack of training. Lack of instructing their staff how to deal with customers, how to alleviate a situation with upset customers.

Our waitress was so slow with everything. Taking our orders, getting us drinks, getting us bread, getting us utensils... Pretty much anything that a waitress is suppose to do. She also didn't even ask if we wanted drink refills once. I had to walk over to the bar and ask the bartender, who asked where I was sitting and then sent the waitress over. We asked for new forks after ordering cheesecake for dessert and didn't get those for a good 5-10 minutes so we just sat there unable to eat it because she had cleared our old utensils away.  She came by twice at the very beginning of the meal within a few minutes of each other to check on how we were doing, but of course we didn't need anything because we had just gotten our food. After that, she never checked on us again and was impossible to flag down. This was on a Monday night so it wasn't even that busy. It took 2 hours for a dinner of three very simple dishes even though we ate fairly fast and got the check right after finishing up.  I entered the restaurant in a good mood, and left very irritated by the poor service. I didn't even get her name because she wasn't around long enough for me to ask.

I always think it's funny when places withhold straws or ice, iono, seems to be a growing tread.  I went with one of my usuals, orange chicken, which was good. Big portions, same good sauce, and a giant coke. Service was so-so at times hard to get the servers attention, and with 18% gratuity, I want some stealer service, that's just me.

However, consider the dishes as being two meals, and it is actually affordable. I had the Chicken Bellagio and it easily was plenty for dinner and the next day's lunch. The cheesecake is expensive (my Red Velvet Cheesecake was $8 for one slice) but it is worth splurging for the experience once or twice a year. The service at this location was just terrible. My server COMPLETELY ignored me. I spent a very long time looking over the menu, with no sign of my server coming to check up on me. I then finished the menu, placed it across the table, and began checking Facebook on my phone. It was still another 5 or 10 minutes before the server came to take my order, and this was while sitting RIGHT BY the order entry computer that almost always had an employee standing at it. No one noticed me at all. Once the food finally came, the performance was repeated. I sat with my finished plate across the table from me for 10 minutes or more before someone noticed me. At this point, I was just waiting to see how long it would actually take, because the length of time was actually rather comical.

bruce k.,"Palo Alto, CA",2,84,,4.0,8/21/2012,"I am not much of a fan of Cheesecake the food, but I am definitely a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I usually do not like chains so much, but after a few times of going to the Cheesecake Factory when nothing else was around I stopped taking this chain for granted.  They do a dang good job! I realized I have never really gotten anything bad in this place.  The worst thing I can say about it is that it is crowded and loud sometimes, but the food is dependable and good, above par for most chain restaurants and the service is above average - not perfect but very good . The Seared Tuna Salad is my favorite, and I don't do dessert much anymore, but the Strawberry Shortcake is amazing.  I once got some fried egg roll kind of things with avocado in them, which tasted OK, but they had so much oil in them they were swimming with it ...  a bit too much. One other thing that I appreciate more and more in life as time goes on is that they restroom was clean, quiet and sanitary. Thank for Cheesecake Factory for being dependable and having a good Seared Tuna Salad and Strawberry Shortcake ... and I am not kidding about the Strawberry Shortcake ... it's perfect for 2 or maybe even three people! ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=500

I knew it was going to be a long night since we had so much food but little did I know that this place was going to drop the ball on something simple like a steak. It all started with no lemon for my water so I had to ask a few times. Did I get refills on my water? Nope, I drank someone else's.  My Order: Filet mignon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. My steak was severely overcooked to well done and my broccoli was cold. Our server brought out some fresh broccoli but the steak took about 25 minutes to get one medium well. By that time everyone had basically finished their food.  I've experienced such better service and execution at my local cheesecake factory that I probably won't be back to this location. I do give them a slight break because we had such a large group but I would think that my server would have noticed the steak over cooked before he served it. In addition there was no compensation for the mistake or the wait and both of the servers were handed 18% as a tip. Another flaw in the restaurant industry!

We negotiated with her for what we wanted in return, the manager came out and we decided on a fair exchange. Low and behold, they even went an extra step and hooked it up. So why no 5 starts? Well first of all they have some problems with their service. The cooks are not communicating to the staff what they have and don't have. Second, the runners have no clue what is on the menu. There are a lot of items, and it doesn't seem like the runners eventually become servers, so whatever. My biggest qualm is the time it takes to get an alcoholic beverage.

We haven't eaten at this location before. We arrived around 6:20 for dinner on a Sunday night and were promptly seated. After taking our order, our server -- unprompted -- brought out a special plate of bread and sliced bananas for our almost-3 year old to munch on. Outstanding! The bread, especially the dark break, is, as always, delicious and easy to fill up on before your main course. We were saving room for dessert so skipped any appetizers. For dinner, my wife, mom and I all had combination plates with the Steak Diane and seafood. My wife and mom had Shrimp Scampi, I had herb crusted salmon with a white wine sauce. We all really enjoyed the steak -- which was wonderfully moist and tender, and the sweet wine sauce with mushrooms really were fantastic. My salmon was delicious and perfectly cooked, and we all remarked that the mashed potatoes were superb. My son enjoyed his chicken fingers, which were crisp but not greasy and made with high quality white meat. He enjoyed the ranch and the honey mustard sauce. The sliced fruit that accompanied it was a fresh and delicious mix of apples, pineapple, pear, orange, and strawberry. For dessert, my mom and wife said were the best Tiramisu they'd ever enjoyed (and we've had some pretty good ones in Tuscany a few years ago). Perfectly balanced flavors and sponginess. We also shared a slice of the chocolate truffle cake, which was really amazing. The chocolate was dark enough to satisfy me (I love dark chocolate) but not so dark as to shock my wife's palate, and it somehow managed to stay perfectly rich but not overpowering. The ice cream and whipped cream that came with it helped take just enough of the edge off. My son even had a few bites and didn't find it overpowering. Quite remarkable that we were all delighted by the dessert, even though we have slightly different palates. Also, a special thank you to the staff who when told we were there for my Mom's birthday brought the Tiramisu out with a candle and a special Happy birthday message, then they proceeded to serenade her with a Happy Birthday song. Thank you! The grand ceilings and decor made this a really fun special occasion restaurant. The service was efficient, kept our water cups and bread basket full, and was fast with the dessert delivery and the check. The price/value was excellent, considering the quality and quantity of the food we enjoyed.  We haven't been in a while. But this experience ensured that we'll be going back again before too long!

Tako B.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,34,1,3.0,5/27/2012,Solidly an average restaurant. Cheesecake factory has a fairly consistent experience as far as their locations go. I go here every so often because it's one of the few places that are open late. Service is good sometimes and sometimes you don't know where your server is but another server or the manager are often helpful. Most of the food is really salty and I have to drink 3 glasses of water. The portions are usually really big and I have to pack the stuff Togo. Cheesecake is good and most the food isnt bad despite the saltiness. I would recommend the peanut butter honey shake that one is really good.  So would I recommend this place? Probably not but it isn't a bad choice. It's just the same as all the other locations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=520
Kenneth Y.,"Tampa, FL",2,6,,1.0,4/29/2011,"My wife and I just tried to have dinner there. We were promptly seated and then no one came by our table for 10 minutes!!! UNEXCUSEABLE !!! The sole job af the host/hostess is to greet, seat and tell the waitperson that a guest has been seated. I never saw the host/hostess do this last critical step for any of guests that came in after us. The management clearly does not know how to properly run a resturant to prevent these type of gaffs. The owner needs to fire the person in charge and hire a better person. They lost the $70 we would have dropped there tonight and our future business.

Rosa C.,"Antioch, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/22/2011,"Back in early April 2,  2011, I took my son for his b-day dinner, and when his dish was brought to him, he mentioned that tasted kind of salty, I suggested to him to ask the waiter about it. At the same time my cousin and I tried his seafood pasta dish, and what a surprise of the amount of salt that was added to it! When the waiter came over, my son ask him about it. Soon after the manager on duty came over, and he said that this dish is prepared with this huge amount of salt, that we didn't know better.  I must say that what a very poor way to go about this issue, without him verify and mend the issue with the cook. Well, my son was offered to order a similar dish, and he decided to order prawns fettuccine, and this time wasn't salted as the original dish was.  The only bad thing that I see in here is how the Manager handled this situation in a niece restaurant as The Cheese Factory chain is.

The great service might have been the fact that the bf & I came in at 11 for a late night dinner after he got off work but it was still pretty packed either way.   the food was also very delicious. the boyfriend got the spicy crispy chicken sandwich & I got the cuban sandwich, both verryyy good but his was definitely better than mine..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=520
Shelly T.,"San Francisco, CA",24,89,84,4.0,1/24/2012,"I've only ever gotten cheesecake to go here, so I'll let my review speak just for that. One great thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that they have tons and tons of, well, cheesecake. It's not something I can eat every week (although I can't lie, I really want to), but on special occasions I'll drop in and nab a slice.  The first time I came here with a friend, we wanted to sit at a table and catch up over some dessert, but we were told only restaurant patrons could sit inside. Bummer! I'd rather have gone to a cafe and gotten a pastry, but we'd already picked what flavor cheesecake to get (an agonizingly slow and painstaking process). The other couple times I've always gotten either the turtle pecan cheesecake (so good for you pecan and chocolate lovers out there!) and the coconut cheesecake for the coconut enamored bf. I love that they give scrumptious cheesecake with a fat dollop of calorific whipped cream for that extra sugar rush that I love. Sometimes you have to very expressly get the attention of someone at the register to let them know you want a slice to go since they're often busy with long lines of people. It gets packed so come early to get dessert before dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=480
Carrie H.,"Mountain View, CA",19,89,200,3.0,1/3/2011,"I was told there's always a long wait at Cheesecake Factory but surprisingly, there was no wait when I came here at 8pm on a Friday night. My friend recommended the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls - rice paper rolls with asparagus, shiitake mushroom, carrots, rice noodles, green onion, cilantro and shrimp. Very flavorful other than the skin of the rolls was too thick. The garlic noodles with shrimp, fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms and parmesan in a delicious garlic sauce was a nice and light meal for a not too hungry stomach. The tiramisu was mediocre as the coffee liqueur was not strong enough for my taste. The staff was really polite and helpful. The interior décor reminds me of Caesars Palace at Vegas.

Wrong answer.  If you're out of what's offered on the menu at that time, maybe you should give me the substitute for the same price?  It's only chicken!   Moreover, when I got halfway into the sandwich I realized it was not the ""Club"" as described, but a chicken, cheese & avocado thing.  Again, it was delicious but, not exactly what I ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=480

Otherwise, the staff let 12 of us get in properly- we made it 1 hour earlier than our dining time because they don't take reservations after 5pm.

I had a chinese chicken salad, not very salad lotsa crispies and topping. I also had a wasabi crust ahi tuna which was interesting- I can't make it at home so it was good I guess.

Hany P.,"Melbourne, Australia",14,14,5,4.0,11/6/2012,"I was heading back to San Jose from Redwood City and the traffic on the freeway was  ridiculous. Decided to stop off for dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, which immediately springs to mind as a dinner destination... kind of like how you go to the Pancake Parlour for their steaks. As far as first impressions go, I have to say this place was outstanding. High ceilings, tastefully fitted out, slightly dimmed mood lighting and jazzy music that was loud enough to add ambience and not too loud as to overpower conversations. All of this made for the perfect setting to take a beautiful dinner companion. On to the food - the menu is extensive which does me no good at all as I have an incredibly hard time deciding. I settled on the Chicken Madeira which had mushrooms, mash and asparagus in a wine sauce and ordered some fried calamari as an entree. I probably spoiled my appetite by eating the calamari as the servings here are quite large even for an entree, but my general impression was that the food was tasty but heavy as the traffic on 101-South after work... My fiancee had a salmon salad which when I tasted it, it was cold but I believe that's how it was supposed to come out. I usually don't care much for salads at all so I won't comment but she said that ""I would usually give it a 4, but for what I wanted to eat tonight, this is a 5"". Overall, an enjoyable experience but certainly not a 5. It takes a lot for me to give a 5-star rating and this place was let down by a few things: - the bill came to me whilst I was in the middle of eating my main which is something I absolutely hate - I think I found a hair in my garlic aioli calamari dip. Normally this is grounds for an instant one-star but I'll let this one slide because I'm not sure if it was my own hair... - the service I was merely okay. Don't get me wrong, everything came out promptly (including the bill), but to get a 5, I need the waiters to engage in some humourous banter! Didn't get a chance to try the cheesecake; I generally don't like cheesecake anyway because I find it quite sour on my palette. Probably would have been a 3 but the decor and ambience deserves an extra star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=480

Matt V.,"Sunnyvale, CA",672,313,59,3.0,1/29/2012,"I've been here a few times, and there's not much that sets it apart from other Cheesecake Factories. The ambiance inside the restaurant is decadent. There are high ceilings and swanky decor bathed in yellow lights. Large pillars run from the floor to the ceiling; it feels very fancy. The restaurant is usually very crowded, and there's a lot of noise from all the patrons in the restaurant. Hard to get seated immediately unless you have a reservation. Service is okay, although there will be stretches of time when you don't see your server at all, even if your glass of water or basket of bread is empty. This is probably because there are so many patrons in the restaurant, all of whom keep the servers quite busy. The food is decent enough; I like the Cashew Chicken, especially, which is a nice spicy dish served with green onions and roasted cashews. The menu claims that it's a Mandarin dish, but I doubt that. Honestly, I doubt that it was even inspired by a Mandarin dish! Hard to avoid the cheesecake at the end of the meal, too! I think my favorite is the Oreo cookie cheesecake! Definitely puts a good end to the meal! Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a chain, and isn't anything too special.

Also, they failed to throw bread in the bag and I live for that rye bread.  So, double boo.

Of course, no one else is going to experience this.. but still--it just reminded me why I cringe when someone mentions Cheesecake Factory. After being seated, the waiter brought water and practically dropped his tray right in front of me (thank goodness it didn't roll at me, but my silverware flew and almost attacked my friend). ok ok. so s**t happens. 2 people ordered regular menu items and the food came fine. I ordered from their brunch menu Eggs Benedict with bacon and spinach, while my friend ordered the Giant Belgian Waffle with Strawberries, Pecans and Chantilly Cream. His waffles arrive and I definitely knew we were in a recession. There were no pecans, maybe 2 strawberries sliced (max), and no cream. It looked pathetic because I knew a time when I would drool when he ordered it. We had the waiter take it back and add pecans and a drizzle of cream.  Then my dish came... ok, I don't eat at Cheesecake Factory much so I was eating mine and thinking.. ok I know I ordered Eggs Benedict, but I ordered the other one that said it was available with Ham and Hollandaise with Fresh Spinach, Bacon and Grilled Tomato with no mention of eggs (I admit.. I was going through a clueless moment). I got up, found our waiter and asked him, ""your Eggs Benedict doesn't come with eggs??"" with sincerity because maybe I'm the idiot that ordered the wrong thing. He took it back and had another made, the muffin came out cold, the eggs were cold (most likely the ones that didn't make it on my plate), the stacking order changed significantly.

mark a.,"Mountain View, CA",0,9,7,1.0,5/23/2010,"Went to the Palo Alto location a couple months ago, and had the worst dining experience of several questionable visits over the years and I'm compelled to write a review now. Service has always been inconsistent, and definitely not this location's strongest suit, from forgetting orders to serving other customers first to just plain negligence. I'm guessing the staff has a high turnover and/or training really needs to step up their game because any quality of service was non-existent.  This last visit we ordered the spicy ahi tempura rolls, a standard favorite of ours, but this time the dish was incredibly salty and to top it off, a piece of a wooden skewer remained in one of the pieces. The fried zucchini was not as crispy, and the other dishes we ordered lacked the usual flavor and taste we've grown accustomed to.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this location and restaurant - there are many better choices in the Peninsula.  The best CF location we've ever been to is in Fresno, service and food was top notch. An oasis from the heat indeed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=560

But now I have and whaddya know, it's about more than just cheesecake.  The decor is pretty gaudy. Toned down like halfway and it might be really pretty in there. Just don't look around too much. The lighting is low at least. There is also a neat row of mirrors along the tables in the front that makes checking out the high-top tables behind you possible without turning around. It's loud enough that you can talk freely without worrying that people can hear you, but it's not so loud that it loses all sense of intimacy. The menu is too thick. Way too many choices. For someone with food ADD like me, it's torture. I suggest you pick something quickly, don't over think it, and just close the menu. Started with the Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke. Came with a balsamic vinaigrette and a creamy garlic dip. It wasn't bad, but a little too salty and I could've made it as good at home for a fraction of the price (it was $9.50). Most of the app choices are pretty straightforward, but there are a lot of them. Chicken Madeira for the entree. Let's break it down... Sautéed Chicken Breast - Pounded flat, two average size pieces, cooked well. Topped with Fresh Asparagus - Two spears. Really? Should they even be allowed to list it on the menu? and Melted Mozzarella Cheese - I'm inclined to never think something has too much cheese. There's plenty. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce - Kinda sweet. Decent complement. Served with Mashed Potatoes - HUGE serving. Skin-in. Yum. My dinner companion got Thai Lettuce Wraps. They come with chicken, but if you want them vegetarian instead, they'll substitute your choice of avocado or.... something else. Enormous plate. Like a whole head of lettuce. Bright and fresh. For dessert, I had a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake. I know, I said I don't like cheesecake, but I have a weakness for vanilla anything. It tasted just like a massive creamy version of one of those vanilla tootsie rolls. Maybe too much vanilla even for me. With some chocolate syrup or fruit or something, it might be really good. The server wasn't bad. College age, for sure, as most of the servers seemed. A little unsure of himself, but no problems. He answered all our questions. Orders came out quickly and he was reasonably attentive the whole meal. I enjoyed the meal, but for the price, I could take or leave it.

The cheescake was super rich, the whipcream was super rich . .  overall it was too sweet for me but my dessert companion seemed to eat it all up anyways.  I had some champagne with chambourd - tasty. Overall a slightly romantic, sweet spot with pretty good food but for not so cheap.  Nice if you are looking for a late night, not too busy bar to chat, flirt and kiss at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=620
Earle H.,"Atlanta, GA",204,168,77,4.0,9/2/2012,"I generally don't do chain-restaurants too much but the Cheesecake Factory will always hold a special place in my heart because I went shortly after they first opened the chain back in the early 1990s and it blew my freakin' mind to see a multi-page menu of cheesecake options.  Plus, they have a huge variety of foods and they pretty much make everything that they put on their menu well.  Not much more you can say behind a 4-star rating.  The drinks and food are both consistently enjoyable and any variation will probably come down to the customer service you get at each location but again, you can't really go wrong with the variety and flavor of the food and drink options.  Solid!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=620

In general, the food is great so its the service that needs tweaking. Good service experiences include them decorating the cakes and stuff when you tell them its your birthday. The staff are generally friendly. Bad service experiences are usually the wait time. And they once screwed up my order of chicken gumbo with no shrimp. Even though the waiter knew it's because of alleriges, i ended up with shrimp in my gumbo and they didn't really fix the problem cos i stumbled on the shrimp towards the end of my dish. Another bad experience was that they simply forgot to seat us for about 10mins even though we were waiting right next to the counter (where they take ur name). Only after I noticed other people going ahead of us when its obviously not right, did they apologise and notice us waiting. But all in all, i love the steaks and the general atmosphere.

Lisa P.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,89,4,2.0,1/17/2010,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory last night to celebrate.  We started with champagne and the appetizer sampler. Huge amount of food and we should have stopped there, as the quality was OK for the price. Instead, we also ordered the cobb salad, then the herb crusted salmon and farfalle. Farfalle was good, great sauce and huge portion. The salmon was ok, fresh but rather blah. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were food. The salad was disappointing. All their salads are disappointing. It's like they use the same overly chopped salad as the base for all their salads, from cobb to asian and they could even do coleslaw. The dressing, the toppings, it all tasted the same as another salad I had at another cheesecake factory in Vegas. The plates that came with the salad were warm, and they were not exchanged when the entrees came.'

They did not have the order ready, all the damn cheesecakes were still frozen and they were to be served in two hours. Let's just say, they only saw the order until I came and made the order. I was a little peeved, and upset because we gave them $170 worth of business, and they didn't really have to do much work!  To top it off, they were a biznatch to friggin' cut cuz they were rock hard for awhile. We had to keep them in the office for awhile before we served them. The only saving grace is that one of my co-workers was a master at cutting them, so we were able to eat cheesecake with some extra effort.

The mac and cheese balls are so wonderful and full of calories. The Thai lettuce wraps are good for an American restaurant. Salads - huge. You need to share if you're planning on going the whole route. Don't care for their pasta dishes, but anything red meat (although I noticed the portions are smaller) and chicken have been fine. The desserts - absolutely love their banana cream and dutch apple caramel cheesecake. Chocolate fudge sundaes, yum. I'm a big whipped cream fan but they don't need to waste it as a huge garnish.

Sides arrived after we had finished eating our steaks. -Table we sat at was sticky and dirty even though it had been set. We dealt with it because the original table we were brought to was not clean. We were told to wait until someone wiped it off. No one ever came after 15 minutes to clean it so the host sat us at another table. -We both ordered steaks and were informed by the manager that they were out of all the steaks except for the filets. We ordered the fillets then were told by the waiter that they were out of those too then informed that our order was really something else then everyone got confused. Even the man at the table next to us told us he would leave if he were us.

Jenny H.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2012,"I really wish Yelp would allow zero stars, or at least half a star. This place needs to be shut down to allow for a decent restaurant  to open in its place. I normally don't bother writing reviews, but this place got me so mad, I couldn't just sit by and do nothing. I've been here with friends a few times and the food is hit or miss. Strangely enough, the faster the food comes out, the better it is. I guess they fail when they take forever to cook here. The service is a different story. Each time I've been here, the service has consistantly gotten worse. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar this time, and were promptly and continually ignored until we finally left. We were going to have dinner, but left after we finished our appetizers. The guy at the bar just stayed down at the end of the bar and chatted with all of the other employees when they came by to pick up drinks for their customers. The whole restaurant was pretty slow, so there wasn't any reason for the service to be so slow. We should have left after it took between 5 or 10 minutes for the bartender to take our drink order from 10 feet away. I guess that's our fault. Then it took fifteen minutes for him to bother checking to see if we wanted to order food. We order 2 appetizers that were just OK. It was at that point that we decided to throw in the towel, and go eat somewhere else. Before we left we politely asked where the restrooms were. Without even looking up from his cell phone, he pointed off into nowhere and shouted ""around the corner"".  We asked the girl at the front desk if the bartender was new, but to our surprise, she said he was the head bartender and had been there longer than anyone else! I guess he's past his prime, and needs to go find a new job. I just hope he doesn't go work anyplace we will be dining in the future, because it sure won't be here again.

When girls take pictures, they want to be in a cute environment, and Cheesecake Factory is definitely cute.   Second, the pumpernickel bread here is excellent. Sometimes it's cold, but it's good even then. My friends and I usually ask for the pumpernickel only, cause no one really wants to eat the other white bread.  Third, the portions are huge, so you don't feel like you're getting gypped. Food-wise, I'd recommend you stick to pasta if you're not sure what to order, because all the pasta dishes are decent. My favorite dish here is actually the farfalle pasta with chicken.

Kimberly C.,"Palo Alto, CA",240,292,66,4.0,9/8/2010,"Why the low stars? I love this place.  The decor here is so amazing. I want my dining room just like it, with beautiful high ceilings, cloud painting and angels..I love it.  The place is great for a quick bite and drinks, dessert-mmm cheesecakes and cakes, romantic dinner or even a group dinner. The busiest times would be during dinner on Fri or Sat.  They don't take reservations, so if you have to wait, go grab a drink.  They have some really good cocktails. I've had their martini, mojitos, and their champagne cocktails. Very yummy. They bring you yummy sourdough bread and multigrain.  The hubs and I always finish 2 baskets.  Too good and I think its fresh. They have the biggest menu ever..I think it's a book.  It has to be with all the advertising they have in there.  The nice thing is that they have EVERYTHING!  From breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, fish/poultry/steak, asian fusion, tacos, and more.  If you don't know what you want to eat, go here..although, you might have too much to choose from. Yummies: Crab wontons  Thai lettuce wraps- my favorite! Love their sauces Chicken Bang Bang- yummy curry like sauce, shrimp, chicken and rice Mac and Cheese Dessert-  Classic Cheescake Red Velvet Cheesecake - THE BEST!!! Lemoncella cake- one of the lightest things for dessert but SO GOOD!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=600
Deepika S.,"Redwood City, CA",77,123,22,4.0,6/9/2010,"I've been here a couple of times, but this one was a great experience.  Maybe because I shared it with an amazing person.  hehehehe. I was really in the mood for pasta since my friend had mentioned cheesecake a couple of days before.  So we're walking on University Ave.  I see some pretty good restaurants....A battle between Trattoria and Cheesecake.   I must say I was very proud of myself for making a decision and sticking with it.  They have a fantastic menu.  If you don't know what you're in the mood for.  I would definitely recommend this place.  They have a variety of asian cuisines, american and italian.  We had a tough time deciding what we wanted. First off, we walked in and the waiter took us straight to the table.  It was on a Friday night around 7 p.m.   The waiter brought us some bread and butter and walked away.  They had a pretty long list of drinks, but since we wanted to hit a bar after, we skipped on that.   When we finally decided on an appetizer, it was hard to get the waiters attention until another waiter saw me looking around and told our waiter to go to our table.  That was nice of him.   We started off with some chicken samosas.  It came with a yogurt cilantro sauce.  I wasn't very impressed.  It wasn't your typical indian samosa.  It was just ground chicken in spices wrapped and fried in an egg roll sheet.  It wasn't great but since my boyfriend didn't like it at all, I finished the other three lol. For my main course, I had the Cajun Jambalaya with Chicken and Shrimp.  I LOVED THIS DISH.  It was sooo good.  And I loved the way they cooked the shrimp.  I told the waiter to make it extra spicy.  And they did.  VERY VERY IMPRESSED. My boyfriend had the Pasta Carbonara with chicken and smoked bacon. But instead of the the spaghettini he had the waiter replace it with Penne.   That was yummy.   Cons-not enough bacon:) We had a lot left over because the portions were huge.  After looking at the dessert menu I had to have my tiramisu to go.  Not a good choice.  I should've gone with the Cheeeeesecake duhhhh!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=640

When I got my salad, it was dressed lettuce with nothing else! I asked my waiter about this strange occurrence and he seemed confused with what I was talking about.

Dave S.,"Redwood City, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/7/2015,"I received a gift card for the cheesecake factory for Christmas. I avoided going there thanks to at best mediocre, chain restaurant food, I have had at the Pasadena branch, but I did have a gift card to use so my wife and I ate a late lunch today at the Palo Alto one. That was a mistake. I must say I had probably one of the worst meals I have had in a dozen years. I ordered the chicken, biscuits and gravy.  It arrived cold, not luke warm. but cold. I asked to have it heated a couple of minutes. When it came back It was missing the gravy and most of the chicken. When I peel back the center of the dish I found one tall 6"" diameter lump of dough with a crust on top of it. There was only about 4 oz. of chicken. Also on my plate were 1/3 carrot cut into 4 pieces, teaspoon of peas and a few pieces of mushroom with about 1/2 cup of chopped onions. My wife had ordered chicken madeira which had 2 large chicken breasts with cold mashed potatoes.  I gave her my 2 tablespoons of mashed potatoes which were warm by now. She said she loved her food but is complaining of indigestion now, 2 hours later. I do have to give 1 star as the French bread and pumpernickel baguettes were very good.  I would stop in for the baguettes but would avoid ordering any food.

They literally have different foods from virtually every different ethnic group you can think of. All of it is cooked fresh, prompt, and generously. Since we normally go during the weekdays, the wait for a table is 5 minutes at the most. I do remember being in on a Friday nite, and having to wait almost an hour for a table (but the wait was well worth every minute of it...) The waiting staff is very friendly and prompt, and the only complaint I've ever had is waiting too long for a bread basket, and that only happened once.  Do not even think of walking out of this place without trying a slice of Stefanie's Red Velvet Cheesecake. It is hands down the best cheesecake I have ever had in my life. I mean come on, you came to Cheesecake Factory for Cheesecake, right? You could go to McDonald's if you just wanted a burger and fries. The Red Velvet Cheesecake is the best thing that ever happpened to that chain, and I highly recommend it to everyone. This place is on the pricy side, it normally costs me and my girlfriend about $50 each time, but I promise you it is well worth every dime.

So we waited and waited, then overhead our waiter talk on his cell phone right behind us about how he only had one table left and he couldn't wait to leave at 5:30. A few minutes later some food arrived....but NOT our appetizers. It was our main dishes. When we mentioned we had ordered appetizers he said that he forgot to put the order in. Yeah that stuff happens, but come on...a second before you were on the phone complaining about how you had one table left.  So the food was just blah. I had some pasta and shrimp dish. The shrimp was greasy. The pasta was barely al dente. There wasn't much flavor, but it was rich. And now 2 Pepcids later, I am still sufferring from my meal. Yeah the cheesecake is good, but when the waiter brought my piece out the  lime fell off the top and he picked it up with his hand and put it back on the whipped cream. Gross.

The green salad was the baby mixed green type, it was ok but my unsophisticated palate would prefer iceberg lettuce. The sandwich was a half turkey on 1/2 of a small baguette. The turkey was nice and moist.

Anderson S.,"Los Altos, CA",9,24,1,5.0,3/2/2009,"They don't take phone reservations because they like having a line out the front door. There, I've spoken the unspeakable. But in my opinion, the line would be even larger if they took reservations. I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory. They consistently have good servers, large portions, and food and presentation quality that is above average. My biggest disappointments in the past have been with the kitchen. Major food delays, and once an undercooked hamburger patty (one of my pet peeves). But there were no such issues on this visit. The wait for a table was arduous, but expected. They ran out of pagers, so it meant multiple visits to the host stand. There was not enough seating in the lobby, so I took up residence on one of the benches outside. In winter months this can be more of a chore. We were seated in the bar, which was great because there was a basketball game on TV. Unfortunately, the screens were so small that we couldn't see the score or much of the action. Why don't they have bigger screens? After being seated, our waiter Roger M. was at our table in less than a minute taking our drink orders. We were waiting on one of our group to arrive, so while we put in our appetizer and entree orders, the waiter offered to hold off on the entrees until our last guest arrived. When Roger saw our final guest arrive, he waited for him to get comfortable in his chair before asking for his order. This is the level of service that I admire about Cheesecake Factory, and Roger was even above that already high level. I ordered the nachos and the grilled cheese, and was happy with both. We ordered extra cheese on the nachos, which is a $2 surcharge at most restaurants but a free addition at CF. However, the portions of the nachos were not what I expected. The last time I ordered the nachos (two years ago) they had a large mound of chips with a wide variety of toppings. However, on this visit it was a moderately sized bed of chips with cheese, jalapenos, sour cream, guacamole, and diced tomatoes. Really good, but we will order with meat next time. The grilled cheese was crispy as usual, but overcooked to the point of almost being burned. The fries were warm, but they didn't taste fresh.

That waiter is lucky we tipped him already, because if he did that before I tipped him, man would his tip have gone down. Please keep in mind that the restaurant was still OPEN by the time we left, and there was PLENTY of place to seat any other customers who wandered into the restaurant later at night.

Anything you can think of is probably on there, somewhere. Don't consider taking a date here - it can be very noisy. If it is your birthday they will sing to you and do a special birthday twist on a dessert that you order or that someone orders for you.  Service was great on the Friday night I was there. One of the chefs from the kitchen walked around and asked if everyone liked the food. Friendly waitress. I was happy.  This is a great place for dinner when you are with a group that just wants to talk and have fun in a lively restaurant. It's a solid choice. If you are with picky eaters or with indecisive people that cant choose a restaurant, you will be thankful for the Cheesecake Factory. Most people are usually just fine with coming here.

I handed the manager our bill (which I paid minus any tip) let him know what was going on, and stood in line at the to go counter.  He didn't even attempt to offer us any help or investigate further.  The server at the counter was helpful and nice, but not enough to make up for wanting to come home and share this experience with my fellow yelpers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=660

Glenn H.,"Pacifica, CA",149,660,557,2.0,8/12/2007,"I agree with Alex G. This place could have been maybe 4 stars today had the service not sucked wind. The place was not even partly full for brunch and we waited nearly 1/2 hour for our entrees to arrive. We had three brunch items: an omelet, a chorizo scramble (mine) and smoked salmon. The bad: - Slow service to start for a nearly empty place. - A waitress that didn't seem to know her job (seriously) - A kitchen that didn't seem to know who to tell when the entrees were ready, so they arrived mostly cold. The outside food of the dishes was actually cool to the touch. - Management that seemed inept to handle the problem properly. - The bagel for the smoked salmon was cold and not even toasted, and the plentiful greens accompanying it had no dressing. - The sour dough toast provided was provided hot with no butter. When asked for butter (after trying to flag her down) she took a very long time, so the toast was now cold. - When they re-did a the omelet and my chorizo scramble, they charged us for two more meals and then removed them--the net was that we were charged full price for everything. - We were stuck chewing on bread & drinking coffee until they came out with the dishes again--by that time we were tired, pissed and not fully hungry. The good: - The management came out three times trying to apologize and promising ""perfect"" service the next time - We were offered a salad or soup (on the house was assumed) but we turned it down because this was more breakfast than a dinner. - My dish (when it came out the SECOND time--hot this time) was excellent. - The decor looked nice.

But that's all you've got working for you cheesecake factory. The service is consistently slow, and the massive ceilings and stalactite looking lights make me feel like i'm in a cave.  The teriyaki chicken was mediocre, and the sauce on it could double up as the sugary base for a bad energy drink. I don't really understand why people come here except for a slice of cheesecake.  Palo Alto is loaded with awesome restaurants.  The two things cheesecake factory really sells is the portions and the ambiance.  However, Bucca di Beppo has better portions, great service and actually tastes good.  Also, the ambiance and decor at Joya make the cheesecake factory look like a McDonald's.  And really, the food at cheesecake kinda sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=660

There is nowhere to sit in the lobby so we just went outside to wander around. We were seated in a booth and it took almost one hour from the time we were seated to the time our food arrived. Once we were eating the okayish food the server completely forgot about us and kept on forgetting to fill our glasses. At the end, we literally had to hunt down our server for him to bring us the check.  The food is pretty expensive for the quality but that's because the servings are gigantic.

Pam H.,"Redwood City, CA",227,162,63,3.0,10/25/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is a good middle of the road restaurant.  We ate here about a week ago with our good friends Diane and Mike along with their two kids and one of the kids'  friends.  We were seated immediately, which for a Friday night at 630pm was very good.  The place is huge and very noisy- which is good for a ""family"" eat out night.  The kids with us were ages 7, 7 and 3.5.  We were given a roomy booth, which is helpful with kids.   Service was good- waiter was nice and gave valuable information.  The kids servings are pretty huge.  The youngest had macaroni and cheese and it wasn't what he's used to- so my husband had it the next day and thought it was great.  But his sister and friend had enough food that they shared with him and all was fine.  The waiter did offer to take it off the bill, but we knew the leftovers would get eaten, so we said that was not necessary.   The adults ordered some appetizers - the Buffalo wings with a band (forget what they were called) were very spicy and good.  The fried mozzarella sticks were also very good.  For entrees, I had a flat iron steak (I love my beef) and it was very tasty.  My husband had the salmon and thought it was terrific.  Mike had lamb shanks which he said were also very good and Diane had a salad.   Amazingly, we were very good and did NOT order dessert, which really is a sin at the Cheesecake Factory.  Personally, we were going dancing afterwards and helping a friend's son celebrate his 21st birthday and I had a huge birthday cake in my car- so I knew dessert would come later.  The kids did have ice cream and they enjoyed it.   Overall, a good experience.  Parking in Palo Alto can be a challenge-but there are plenty of parking lots and garages on the side streets- which you're better off just going to right away, forget trying to find street parking!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=700

I don't even like mojitos, but they made me a believer! The BEST mojito I'll probably ever have! Avocado egg rolls were unbelievable, although i found the tamarind sauce to be way too sweet. I fixed this by adding salt to it. Chicken was good and fried calamari was perfectly seasoned. Their service was absolutely wonderful! The host showed us to our table and pulled out our chairs and was quite friendly. Best Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  Final Verdict: Everyone knows that the economy is bad.

Although the building is beautiful and inviting, the service at this location is lacking, and the food is awful. Not only was it bad the first time but it was just as bad, if not worse on my second visit. The dining area is incredibly LOUD.The wait staff is horribly unattentive (waitress and hostess chatting in the foyer while putting on lip gloss) while there were only 8 tables filled with patrons, most parties of four or fewer. Our table of two never got refills on beverages, nor did the waiter ask if we were pleased with the food. Nasty, nasty food. I would have sent it back if we ever saw him again before the check was presented. There is absolutely no excuse for such a poor dining experience. They weren't short handed. I counted six servers present, a bartender and a hostess. For a $40 lunch for two I think I could have fared much better elsewhere.

We ordered the Spinach Dip w/ chips as a appetizer. Comes with Salsa and Sour Cream also.

As if the free bread isn't enough...Rye bread (Dark Brown) is the better one BTW as opposed to the white one. Didn't feel like trying anything new so I went and ordered what I usually get here which is pasta. Can't go wrong with the Pasta Da Vinci, comes with Grilled Chicken, Mushrooms, Shitake Mushrooms, with Penne Pasta in some sort of creamy sauce. Had the Waiter go crazy on the Parmesan Cheese also. I feel bad for them because I don't tell them to stop till most of the pasta is all smothered with it.

That was just awful. The other dish in the sampler I was kind of disappointed with was the sweet cornmeal cakes. It's kind of a knock off of the Chevy's sweet cornmeal/bread but I think I like the Chevy's version better. The Cheesecake Factory version was WAY too sweet.

I'm reading off from the menu they have on their website..

It actually took a while for our food to come though-- about 20 minutes since our order, but it actually didn't seem that long because we were busy chatting away.  They gave us large portions too, when the food did arrive, and it was hot and fresh.  Also, we of course, got the complimentary bread to munch on.

This location apparently doesn't teach their waiters about allergies, let alone etiquette.  Once, upon inquiring whether a dish contained an ingredient I was allergic to, a server told me that it was the chef's secret recipe, and he wouldn't be telling me. I got this runaround on multiple dishes--I think he was just too lazy to go ask. Eventually, I persuaded him to get answers, and received curt and inattentive service for the rest of the meal.  Another time, a different server responded to me asking whether a dessert could come without the ingredient in question by telling me that it really was better with it, and I should give it a try. Sure, I get it--a lot of people will say they're allergic to food when they really just don't care for it. Me? We'll be pulling out the Epi-pen if you'd rather go that route. After I said so, she suggested I just not have the dish, because it wouldn't be the same. Again, no willingness to simply answer the question.  Another time, I had a waiter ask me whether I carried an Epi-pen when I asked about allergies. Might've just been trying to make conversation, but it's rather intrusive, and came across as though he was trying to verify whether I really did have allergies.

Travis D.,"Houston, TX",67,437,18,2.0,6/20/2008,"The section of Palo Alto in and around University is loaded with some great (and not so great) restaurants, many of which are not chains. However, the one place that you are guaranteed to find a line out the door every single night of the week is Cheesecake factory. They pretty much embody everything i could dislike about a restaurant: they are a huge chain: they serve uninspired and uninteresting food, prices are high, and their worst offense is that instead of having a smaller menu with some focus and a series of well thought out, well executed, and innovative dishes, they have this behemoth of a menu with pages upon pages of dishes you could find anywhere else.  For my GF however, Cheesecake Factory is a bit of a guilty pleasure. She knows she shouldn't like it, but she does anyway. We went last Friday for their happy hour bar menu and split 4 dishes that were all under $5. We got mini cuban sandwiches, avocado egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and a quesadilla. Everything was good, but you shouldn't be able to order all of that stuff (especially since none of those dishes had a 'twist') from any self respecting restaurant.  The food was admittedly pretty good, and the cheesecake is fabulous.  But the menu that is more hardback novel than well thought out collection of dishes, loaded with glossy advertisements is just too much for me. The marble floors and huge columns also make it feel like they are trying too hard to be upscale, louring people who can't really afford the high prices for pedestrian food but do so anyway because they want to go out for a 'nice dinner'.

Well when we got the bill, took off the fish tacos when we ordered fish & chips, which we never got, but charged us a higher fee for a piece of salmon and ceasar salad when we ordered slamon, vegs, & potatoes which was less expensive. Then when we go to leave the waitress gave us take home bags with the food upside down and then wait..the best... caesar salad to take home when we didn't ask for it...are they trying to make us sick, who ever heard of take home caesar salad, especially on a Saturday night when you are probably not going home right away.    Highly do not recommnend at least this location. 6/23/12",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=780

(Not that I think sorority girls are bitches, some of my best friends are in a sorority . . . .can I please make fun of them?) The menu is fairly daunting, which I don't know if that's a pro or a con, but if you can make it through all 15 pages of entree suggestions you will enjoy your meal. You can get anything from Asian/Italian/New-Agey cuisine to old-fashioned American favorites. I got some kind of pasta/shrimp meal, it was SO good, definitely high in calories, but whatever. The drinks were also pretty good, and I love the brown bread they bring out, suuuper fluffy. . . . unfortunately I was too full for cheesecake. The reason I can't give Cheesecake Factory 5 stars - the service SUCKS here. You wait forever for a waiter, wait forever to put in your order, and if they forget to bring you a sauce with your meal then forgeddabout it - you won't get it delivered till your food is cold and almost gone.

I usually don't knock two stars based on one time of bad service, but the second time I ate there (went back by myself on a Friday afternoon) I sat at a table for 10 minutes before my server even showed . . .  and for all of you out there who have served, you know its a HUGE no-no to leave a lone guest twiddling her thumbs at an empty table. When my waiter finally showed, he spoke horrible English, acted like he couldn't care less, forgot a ton of stuff, and of course, it took until I was leaving for someone to show up with my side-of-blue-cheese. On top of that - I got food poisoning - from a quesadilla and a salad! (Is that possible?) The Cheesecake factory in Palo Alto looks like it should be a theater, or maybe an art museum . . .

Just plain, fresh, good fish with steamed broccoli - BBQ chicken salad: I just like BBQ sauce on my salad. Makes me feel like I'm not missing out on the good stuff when I go the healthy route. - Hamburgers: I don't know what it is but the sliders and the entree hamburger on the dark bread rolls are oddly enough some of the best burgers I've had. - Cocktail list: Some fun martinis like the strawberry one where they muddle strawberries into it and the bikini one with pineapple juice. - Cheesecakes: You'd be scared if you knew how many types I've had--it's probably easier to note the kinds I haven't tried.

Janie A.,"Redwood City, CA",7,63,,1.0,7/16/2007,"I don't know why I still agree to go to this place, since every single time, without fail, I am severely disappointed in the food, service, bathroom, etc.  Everything about this place is just bad, but in the spirit of intelligent, thoughtful reviews, I'll try to be more specific. First, I have stopped ordering cocktails at any Cheesecake Factory, including this one.  After returning THREE vodka gimlets at the store in SF (at the top of Macy's), the bartender came to my table and explained that they are obligated, by corporate, to follow strict recipes for all cocktails, and are not allowed to deviate from the formula.  Okay, that's fine; now that I understand the rules, no more cocktails at Cheesecake Factory. The food, however, is another story.  I think the visit today put me over the edge.  Each time I have gone to the Palo Alto store, I've ordered a salad.  And each time I order a salad, I request the dressing on the side - super simple, right?.  This is the ONLY request I make (since I'm not ordering cocktails anymore, I'm a fairly low-maintenance patron).  Well, every single time, the salad comes with the dressing already on it.  Which, I really wouldn't complain too much about, since I already have low expectations, but they use too much dressing, and I'm a bit of a veggie lover, so I like to experience the crunch of the greens without the soppiness of the dressing. A few other ""action items"" they could improve on, such as: food taking 45 minutes to come to the table, rude bartenders, incompetent wait staff, stale bread, dirty bathrooms, and a long wait (okay maybe THIS one they can't control). . . I always say yes when my friends or family want to go there, just because I hate to be the one who has to have things my way, but I guess I've just experienced so many other places with such amazing food and great service that I actually dread going to Cheesecake Factory.  Might be time to ""just say no.""  One more thing. . .the enormous variety in the menu means that *nothing* they do is actually that good.  Everything is mediocre, including the cheesecake.  In fact, I think the only reason people still go there for the cheesecake is that they just don't want to make it themselves in their own kitchen, not that I blame them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=740

Lisa L.,"San Jose, CA",69,61,15,3.0,1/5/2010,"Ok...so I came here about two weeks ago with a few friends from work. Here's the breakdown of the good, the bad and the ugly:  The good: *Menu is huge! Pretty much anything you can think of to eat, you can find on their menu. There's certainly no lack of options. I've been to the CF three times and every time I've been, I've been pleasantly surprised with the taste of what they serve.  *Wait staff is fairly accommodating...but more on that later.  The bad:  *Value. Not really there. You're definitely paying for, what I'm sure they think, is an experience. However, they are highly overpriced for what they offer. The food is good, don't get me wrong; it's just not $18 for some teriyaki chicken good. Hence the reason I have an issue with their pricing. For the four of us to eat, getting three cocktails total (not a piece), our bill was close to $160. I didn't think the food and/or service warranted a bill quite that sizeable.  *They don't take reservations. Mind you, I had an ""in"" so I was able to arrange for my friends and I to get a reservation but I was irked at the fact that I had to use my ""in"" rather than just call and get a reservation. They'd earn brownie points in my book if they allowed people to at least use call-ahead seating. Unfortunately, they don't.  *Parking in downtown PA is a pain in the ass! Luckily, the parking gods were smiling upon us that night but I can tell you from experience that it doesn't happen very often. The ugly: *Number one pet peeve of CF? AD'S in their menu! Are you kidding me? Not only am I paying to eat at your restaurant but I have to also be bombarded with ads for shit I don't need and/or want? Um...I think not. Super annoying....and classless!  *Ok.....so as mentioned above, the wait staff is fairly accommodating. The server we had the last time was friendly, patient with us when it took us about half an hour to figure out what we wanted to eat and was mostly attentive during service. However, he was clearly not the brightest bulb in the box. I think he was under the impression that his boyish good looks alone would earn him a huge tip but hey...news flash...I'm not impressed. What will impress me is if you keep my drinks topped off, fill my order correctly and provide gracious service. Your charming little smile only goes so far. But that seems to be the general idea of the staff: they're just too good looking to work for their money. That point was only proven when we had to listen to two waiters talking about how ugly and stupid a third waiter was. Wow...I totally missed that section of my professional training: how to talk shit about someone else while simultaneously making yourself look like the douche bag! *They couldn't even admit that they made a mistake and take personal responsibility. I have a HUGE issue with organizations that are of the ""pass-the-buck"" mindset. When our waiter asked us if we wanted to take our leftovers, of course our answers were ""yes"". So when our food didn't come back after 20 minutes, we started getting a little curious. I pretty much knew that he had thrown it away on accident (probably because he wasn't paying attention when we said we wanted it) but he didn't want to admit it. Instead, he re-fired the food (which was nice) but blamed the other food disappearing on someone else. Who cares whose fault it is? Just get me new food! Simple as that. So there ya have it.

I went to the dessert counter where two people were maticulously putting whip cream on some cakes... they were not to be bothered. I asked politely for the change, and the short chubby one huffed and puffed and rolled her eyes at me as she proceeded to steer away from the whipped cream aparatus to wash her hands and give me change. If it wasn't for her, this would've gotten a 5 star from me. If you like Cheesecake Factory, you'll love Grand Luxe Cafe.

She also happened to be a former employee of this place and knew it wouldn't be crowded. What a waste of time and money. It took them 35 minutes to get my sandwich & fries to me and (surprise!) it was cold. Well, by that time I was starving so I took it as I got it. I got about two bites into my sandwich and picked at a fry until I couldn't take it anymore. I asked our waiter for the manager. He politely asked if it was anything he had done and I let him know that it wasn't. The manager came over after 10 minutes. What a rude, pretentious, middle-aged, shit bag with a receding hairline and a beer gut. He curtly asked what the problem was and when I told him he took the plate, walked off and never returned.  I've never directly complained about food (or really anything) before, but after observing others complain I figured he would have asked how he could make my experience more enjoyable or apologized...something. But no, of course not. After waiting 10 minutes for his Royal Highness of Cheesecakedom to return I left without paying, but not before tipping our waiter.

Las Vegas Egyptian look.  The fact that the menus were identical between Boston and Stanford made me feel right at home. Nothing like the avocado egg rolls.  The fried mac and cheese is also awesome.  Recently (as in tonight) I rediscovered to joys of the Factory Peach Bellini.  I think it's the champagne in it that gets me toasty drunk very quickly.  Therefore, forgive any spelling errors I may have made in this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=800

Brent A.,"Daly City, CA",213,427,22,3.0,10/12/2008,"I would have given Cheesecake a higher rating, but tonight was terrible.  Cheesecake is fairly standard across the board, but the service is the key element to whether or not you have a good experience. The drinks were over-priced and not made correctly.  A blended, ultimate margarita should be blended.  A Kahlua cocktail should have a fair amount of alcohol, not be ice and ginger ale. The salmon firecrackers were tasty, but really it was because of the chili spices that were tantalizing my tongue.  The actual salmon seemed mediocre at best, and certainly less than fresh. My friend ordered an appetizer salad with Caesar dressing, but apparently out waitress thought she said ""Caesar salad."" My spicy chicken salad was terrible.  I'm all for earthy, healthy flavors, but this was certainly lacking.  The cilantro over-powered the entire dish.  The chicken was as dry as the Mojave.  My friend's chipotle pasta was really delicious, but again it was attributed to the chili spices.   Our waitress was terrible.  Terrible.  She took incredibly long to even greet us.  After ordering, she took over five minutes to bring our water.  Our appetizers came out well before our cocktails even arrived.  Every time the waitress came by, she would leave within seconds.  When she asked about our food, I said it was ""okay.""  She asked if I wanted to send my salad back, but at that point it was pointless.   When she came to check up on us at the end of our meal, she took forever to bring our to-go box.  She should have brought the dessert menu with her at the time, but had to scamper away to bring that back.  When she came back for our dessert choice, we decided to not have anything, and then had to wait again for her to magically retrieve the bill.  Seriously, terrible. When we were paying, I took my bill up to the front and complained about the charge for the ""Caesar"" salad, which I admit was only $0.96 more what we should have been charged.  I almost mentioned a few of my other complaints to the manager, and he comped our appetizer salad and my cocktail.  Thanks!  That's the only reason I'm giving this place the extra star because it originally would have been 2. If you come here, hope you get a good server.  Also, be prepared to bring food home because the portions are enormous.  Oh, and if you come here to drink, be ready to pay high prices.  My friend's margarita was $10.50, and my cocktail was $7.50 before it was comped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=800

In this case SIZE does matter, everything is just so frickin' big. I have no issue with a leviathan portion of cheesecake, after all the clue is in the name. My problem is that everything is so offensively large that unless you make a special trip solely for sweet, it is unlikely you will get there as the previous courses will just fill up too much space. Some may say, ""have a salad"" and indeed I did, it was in fairness tasty and interesting, to start with, but after ploughing on for 30 mins to be still faced with a never deminishing pile of food I gave up! The current headline of ""celebrating 30 Delecious years"" should perhaps be changed with ""contributing to obesity for 30 years"".

Granted, it was me plus 14, but every time I went back to ask how much longer, the responses were the same ""we're waiting for one more table to open up so we can get you seated"", ""we're waiting for two more table to open up so we can get everyone in"". Finally, when I talked to who seemed like the manager, all he could say was ""I'm sorry"". Sure he was. And when in the end when I told him that I had been waiting for 2 hours, and if he thought waiting for that long was cool, he went as low to say ""well you could walk over to the bar and have a drink while you're waiting"".

It seemed like every person who was working the front desk didn't care to have eye contact with anybody who walked in, and they didn't have a problem seating about 6-8 groups of around 4-6 people who arrived after I did, and got sat before I did... some even left after enjoying their dinner.  Bottom line, I may have been the fool for believing they were close to getting my group seated, but they could care less about the customer at this place.

With such a large menu of items; we had some simple questions regarding what the * stood for by the items and if the Roasted Veggie & Goat Cheese pizza actually had Goat Cheese ( the ""other"" white cheese, Mozzarella was listed in the description...not goat cheese). We were told it was both. So we ordered 2 of those -- noticed pesto (again, not noted on the menu) on top of the pizza but no goat cheese. Those that know their goat cheese know it has a certain taste. BE AWARE: No goat cheese on the Roasted Veggie & Goat Cheese pizza. We ordered 2 kids cheese pizzas with olives....1 kids pizza came with kalamata olives (not many kids I know like kalamata olives); should of been black olives. Juices never came until asked for several times. The other cheese pizza with olives showed up; adult size with no olives. :/ HUH Salad showed up dry....had to ask for dressing; took forever to get that. By then, one person in our party finally got his meal. The rest of us were halfway done. We had two different servers...I felt bad for the second guy who came in the middle of the meal. The table with 1 person got so much more attention than our table of 7 did....I was speechless! Dessert time: We told the lady in the front we had a b-day with the name; told our server as well....and yet somehow the 2nd server to help us had not been told. I told him and he said they would bring an ice cream sundae. I know this is on the house...but for a place with portion sizes bigger than ones stomach, I was in awe at the cheap sundae given for a birthday! Let alone the lack of ice cream in the sundae. After bringing up the issues with our first server, he did remove the adult pizza and extra apple juice they charged us for and comp. the meal that was late reaching the table. Unfortunately it was a little to late at that point; the disappointment set in from the moment the food arrived and continued to get worse as the night went on. We got our water glasses filled close to when we were about finished with our meals. Service was slow and poor in giving attention to at least our table.

Then the bus boy setting down all the table settings on the table in one pile. Oh we can set that up as customers I guess. Then the birthday girls cheesecake came right at the beginning of dinner.

My raspberry lemonade arrived fairly quickly, but after yet another 20 minutes or so, another waitress arrived at our table and asked if she could take our lunch order. We told her that we had already ordered about 20 minutes earlier from a different waitress; she then said that she would check inside. This is the last we saw of any of these 3 servers. Meanwhile we waited another 15-20 minutes at which time we asked a fourth employee (who was clearing a table nearby) to check on our food as we now had been sitting at our outside table for a good 45 minutes; we also asked her to bring the manager. A few minutes later, the manager arrived (don't recall his name, but was a friendly, youngish Asian)... he seemed genuinely apologetic about it all, and in fact offered us our lunch on the house.

Hollis L.,"Cambridge, MA",31,10,,2.0,9/12/2008,"I think you know what to expect from this restaurant from many of the other reviews already written here, but I'd just like to reinforce their sentiment and add some personal anecdotes of my own. Yes, the portions are big, there's no arguing with that.  However, I would describe the quality of the food as mediocre at best.  For example, the avocado rolls are extremely bland.  Yes, they're loaded with avocado, but that's all you really taste.  It's as if you were just eating huge chunks of unseasoned avocado by itself.  Admittedly, I can't speak to the quality of the cheesecake. Don't get me wrong, I've really wanted to like this place.  However, I was here for a friend's birthday a year ago, and I surreptitiously asked the waitress if Cheesecake Factory could do anything special for her birthday.  They said they would prepare a special dessert for her, etc.  Great, fine.  I reminded her TWICE throughout the course of the evening, and each time she assured me that she remembered and that she was on top of it.  By the time the check had come and we were getting up to go, she just gave us a ""Thank you, goodbye"".  It wasn't even on a weekend. I'm sure there are many, many better places in Palo Alto to eat.  The fact that they don't take reservations and the line is often long is a total pain, as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=880

Honestly, I don't know why it's so popular. The food is greasy and overpriced and the portions are enormous! Who can eat that much? And their normal healthy considerate portions are labeled ""weight management."" It's scary to think how many calories their regular entries are if a 500+ calorie salad is considered ""weight management"" The cheesecakes is not any better than the prolific oven cheesecake.  The only thing i love about cheesecake factory are the avocado eggrolls. SO GOOD. But that's about it. Anything else i've ordered here is ususually good for the first bite or so, then if you continue eating you get sick of the flavors and you get that greasy feeling that settles in with a little time...and you don't even want to finish your leftovers because you still don't feel like eating the greasy food you just had from last night.  The service i've found to be extremely inconsistent. Sometimes i get service so excellent that the waiters actually make me smile, and are consistently available for my needs. Other times i've had rude servers who make me wait and make it difficult for me to make requests.

We complained to the hostess and apparently she had forgotten about us and given our table to another group. Lovely.  In a nutshell, the service here sucks.  It takes forever for them to take our order and even longer for them to bring out our food. Two hours later, we had just ordered our cheesecakes to go and were waiting for our bill. They brought out half the desserts in about 10min and assured us that the rest were ""coming right out."" 30min later the rest of our cheesecakes were still missing and no one had brought us our check.

Say what you will about the Cheesecake Factory, but there is definitely something for everybody on that menu. The thing is like 20 pages long. Even if you removed the ads (annoying but a brilliant business move on their part) it would still be a 10+ page menu. Salads, sandwiches, pastas, main courses, you won't leave hungry. And despite what seems like high prices, you really get what you pay for. A $14 salad is sure to leave you with another meal tomorrow and $3 for extra chicken buys you a whole chicken breast's worth.  The best part about our experience was our fantastic waiter Alex. Alex was quick to take our drink order, checked back frequently until we were ready to order, was totally on top of the refills, easily split our check 4 ways, and did it all with a smile.

Yb W.,"Boston, MA",10,158,25,4.0,6/6/2008,"I am not ashamed to admit that I love chain restaurants and visit them often. I truly believe that what they lack in authenticity and originality, they more than compensate for in terms of mass appeal and price. Chain restaurants can afford to serve larger portions simply because they buy in larger quantities--this is, after all, the basis of Walmart's and Costco's success.  Boutique restaurant snobs may find the prospect of mass-produced food off-putting, but I appreciate the consistency of preparation and reliable flavors.   The Cheesecake Factory is the mother of all chain restaurants. Its huge popularity and large profits has allowed the company to populate suburbs and cities all over the country. I have been to several Cheesecake Factory restaurants across the West Coast, and they all have the extravagance of a casino lobby in Las Vegas.  The restaurant in Palo Alto is no exception. I half-expected to find slot machines in between the bakery and the bar. Actually, they might consider installing them to help pass the two hour-plus wait time for a table on a weekend evening. The source of the popularity is of course the large variety of dishes served and their signature, uber dense and decadent cheesecakes. The fact that the portions served could have single-handedly caused the current obesity epidemic is another reason. I once ordered a half sandwich and salad combo, anticipating a light lunch. The ""half"" sandwich was as big as my head and the salad looked like it came from a whole head of Romaine lettuce. Had I cleaned my plate, I would have died of a food coma. But, as long as we are a society of gluttons (I know I have no self-control), the Cheesecake Factory empire will continue to expand, and will soon join the ranks of McDonalds and Starbucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=900

Tina T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,97,,4.0,1/15/2007,"This is just one of those places I've been to so often that it never occurred to me to write a review for it, but I got all teary-eyed today having lunch there after a long hiatus and I wanted to share the highlights and tips about this place that I've accumulated over time.  First off, the wait can be insanely long but if you're open-minded, try one of the first-come, first-serve tables by the bar. It usually cuts the wait down dramatically. Second, the wheat bread in the bread basket is one of the best I've had anywhere so carb-haters beware! Third, you really get a bang out of your bucks because portion size is huge and most folks have another meal for the next day to take home. But choose from the menu carefully. The restaurant handles basics like sandwiches, burgers, and salads fairly well but some of the more ""ethnic"" fare can be risky - too greasy, salty, oily and any other ""-y"" you can think of. This is definitely not the type of place to be too adventurous and exotic with your entree. Ah, forgot to mention, for those who have huge appetities, the appetizers are definitely worth a try. My personal favorite is the firecracker salmon roll (I even tried to replicate them for my wedding!). Finally, the cheesecake is pretty spectacular so make sure to save some room (eat about 1/3 to 1/2 of your entree). And even with the dessert, the portion size is gynormous so one slice should be shared between 2-3 people. If you keep all these rules of thumb in mind, you should have a decent experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=940

My 7 year old daughter has a black eye and needless to say she was in alot of pain. The waiter felt bad but management did not seem to make a priority of our situation.The restaurant did not even comp our meal or anything!!!! No customer service at all. Please beware when bringing younger children to this location . The wait staff when leaving the kitchen makes a sharp right which there is a blind spot . There is a wall/ divider that is about 4 1/2 ft tall. So anything below that they do not see. This is a problem since it is located right next to the restroom.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=940
June P.,"Palo Alto, CA",3,7,,4.0,1/7/2008,"A go-to for large groups. The menu has a range of food, from salads, to mexican, to chinese, to classic American. Although the ethnic food doesn't quite taste authentic, pretty tasty nevertheless! The prices are pretty high, even during lunchtime. They have a sign that indicates special prices at some random time during the day, such as 3-5 pm or so, but I'll make a better note of that next time I go. The portions are very large though-- almost always enough for lunch the next day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=940

Nate W.,"San Francisco, CA",14,42,,1.0,5/8/2008,"This place should be wiped off the map.  Cheesecake factory and its counterparts: P.F Changs, Benihana, etc. have no place in a region as culinarily rich as the bay area.  I can see going here if you live in the middle of no where, but supporting these glorified Olive Garden/Red Lobster type places is shameful.  If your not wiling to pay a few dollars extra to have a quality meal made by a qualified chef then eat at home.  Maybe prices are high in Palo Alto, but  there are cheaper and better (than cheesecake factory) choices in neighboring cities.  The cheesecake factory makes downtown Palo Alto look like a mall in Scottsdale.  I pick on this location because it is so poorly placed (at least PF Changs had the decency to be at a mall) and the fact that the staff was extremely rude to me when I went in to use the bathroom.-  I'd never eat here, and not because I'm a snob,  I tried it once in Arizona when I was young and dumb and learned that the bigger the menu, the worse the food.  When it comes to university ave. you could throw a dart and hit a better place in any direction.  The problem is quality restaurants have a hard enough time staying open without places like cheesecake factory taking away their business.  The more popular that cheesecake factory gets the more the quality will diminish (even further).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=940

I asked if I could have some blue cheese and the waiter says to me""what do you think I gave you?"" I tell him I have ranch but if I could have some blue cheese as well he rolls his eye and says to me thats what you got why dont you try it. I called over the manger and told him I had ranch and would like bluecheese as well.

Today everything seemed to have changed, we were constantly ignored by waiters no matter how loud we screamed ""excuse me"" or how hard we waived our arms in the air. the appetizers were cold and the salad we ordered didn't even have dressing!!!! quite a few other patrons today seemed to be unhappy as well, I saw a guy at the other table keep shaking his head.

Kylie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",305,385,39,3.0,3/22/2007,"On a busy night this place is crazy.  You wait forever for a table and then you wait forever again for your food and drink...  On a non busy night you will probably get seated right away but unless you have a ""good"" waiter you will wait and wait and wait for your food and drink.  My burger was just fine but my martini was weak.  It is a place that has HUGE portions and A LOT of different items on the menu so if you have alot of people that all want different things... fantastic... hit it up... just don't go when super hungry.  They are not picky about seating two people at a LARGE table which is nice and even though the service is not super great the people usually are at least respectful (if you don't count the waiting)...  So, why do I keep going back here.. well I personally really enjoy the Oreo cookie cheesecake (not the one that is chocolate the one that is plain with Oreo cookies in it).  Never be afraid to split a meal here and be ready to talk loudly because you will not be able to hear nor will you be heard if you speak in a normal voice.

Girlie G.,"Livermore, CA",11,88,18,1.0,12/3/2006,"I wish I could give this place a zero or negative stars.. because if I could, I certainly would.  So, count my 1 star as really a negative star.  Now why you may ask?  Well, I have been to this same location before and have usually enjoyed the overpriced fare at the Cheesecake Factory because.. I don't know why.. I guess I loved their Flying Gurrila so much that I overlooked the other stuff..  So here we went yesterday.. around 4:30PM for a quick Mojito and some appetizers..  Figured, it would be a nice pre-dinner stop while shopping along the University avenue in Palo Alto and since it's not really dinner or lunch time, it's not as busy.  Of course, it wasn't as busy.. it took us less than 5 minutes to be seated so we were happy that great.. we can have our quick drink and snacks and we can be back shopping.  Well, after we were seated, it took about 20 minutes for the waiter to come by to even ask us for our order.  We were patient and said no problem, they are a bit busy or short staffed..  So we gave our quick order for one Mojito and Bruchetta..  Real simple things, remember and we also asked for some water.  15 minutes go by, and no water.. then 20 and finally arrives the water.. so, now we have been here for 40 minutes before we even got a sip of water.. So much for the quick drink..  We're still waiting for our Mojito.... another 10 minutes go by.. the table next to us, who were seated about 10 minutes after us, already got their drinks that they had ordered but we were still waiting..  We thought, well hmm maybe their Mojitos really come from Cuba and they are waiting for Castro to get better before they can serve it or something.. another 15 minutes go by and nothing..  The waitress did stop by when she brought the drinks for the other table saying, ""oh yours will be right up""..  Of course, it was't..  Anyway, so at that point, after 1.5 hrs since the time we were seated, and still no drink or appetizer on our table, we decided to walk out.  I would NEVER go back to Cheesecake Factory ever again... Hell their Flying Gurrila is not THAT good!!!!!   Thank God I didn't do my birthday party there as I was contemplating earlier in the week.  I consider it blessing in disguise.  So, for those of you who want to wait 1.5 hrs for a drink, 30 minutes before even the waiter shows up at your table, and an hour to get a glass of water, by all means and knock socks off and wallets at this joint.. but for those of you who believe in having good service as being part of an important dining or drinks experience, skip this place..  We ended up going to Pasta Trattoria across the street and had a wonderful Blue Mojito and Caprese Salad..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=960

NO BREAD?!?!?! this is what happens when you have the boy get the food. UGH. not his fault... he ordered his kobe burger medium rare, but it looked RARE... he assured me it was warm, but still looked like the blood was just ready to ooze out. so if their food, the service (in & out of the restaurant) SUCKS... why do i keep going back? the cheesecake is still yummy, but then again, they don't make it at their location...

I've been here about 7 times 5 times with a group of people 7 or more, and the other times with 3 people i do have to agree on one thing with Robyn c is the waitresses and waiters suck the big shrimp, other then that  this place is better then most people think you just have to go at the right times, ( remember that this place serves lunch and dinner any time so that's the key this place) if you go during lunch order a dinner plate and visa versa, any ways the jambalaya is good its not with rice its with noodles so that's the only downer but the Jamaican black peppered shrimp with extra spiciness is to die for i might say. their pastas are average  and same with their steak too. but what really takes this place over the top to the 4 star is their cheesecakes and the terimasue cake not the cheese cake one, and i ha vent even been over the appetizers yet and there average too but the avocado egg rolls are the best and the sweet corn cakes those are the one's I recommend  to try  overall this place is good to eat at just try it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=960

mary C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,18,1,4.0,8/23/2007,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time recently.  I've been there a couple of times in the past, but the wait was always huge and so I've never actually eaten there.  I read some of the reviews about the crappy service.  Maybe because we had a party of 6, it went better for us. We had a reservation for 5:30, but  when I arrived, I discovered that the rest of my party was still on the way.  I informed the 2 people behind the desk.  One guy kind of went 'um...' like it would be a problem, but the other immediately interrupted with 'no problem at all! We'll seat you when they come.'  Well I waited a good half hour before they did and when I finally saw them show up I went to the front to let them know.  The guy kind of looked at me like 'why are you telling me?'  but said okay.  It was 10 minutes before we were seated (after a bunch of walk ins).  Once seated our waiter was quick to come.  We received our drinks and bread, then ordered our appetizers.  The appetizers took FOREVER to come.  I had actually forgotten that we'd ordered them.  Then only once came.  Another 10 minutes later and the manager came to apologize saying that the other had disappeared off the counter and they would bring out a fresh one soon.  The waiter took forever coming to get our orders.  I watched as he seated a party of 8-10 and took their orders first.  Then he did take our order.  Due to the huge portions, I just ordered a side of Macaroni and a side of mashed potatos.  To which I received some teasing from our waiter (not that I'm complaining.  Gives some excitement to our dinner).  It was around 1 hour and 20 minutes from seating to receiving our meal, so the service is VERY slow.  Our waiter did offer to box up our food for us.  He spilled my sister's though, so that was turned complimentary.  He also looked at my hardly touched food and after he stated that he just didn't understand, he offered to let me box it to keep it safe.  I'll admit he was funny and we did a lot of joking even if it took ages to get our food.  Plus, I enjoyed my greasy macaroni - which I am now craving as I write this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palo-alto?start=960
