LC C.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,6,4.0,1/4/2018,"Took my brother here for lunch on his birthday. Surprisingly easy to get a table around 1 pm on a Friday.  Servers were really nice, especially when they signaled that we were ordering too much food. While the company might not like that, but ethical staff helps to prevent food waste. The servers also validated our good choices. I appreciated them with a nice tip in return.  Food tastes consistently good compared to other branches. Old Town Pasadena makes parking more challenging. Hope this does not affect business like Cheesecake too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena
Eddie M.,"Long Beach, CA",51,5,16,1.0,1/7/2018,"This is the worst service and experience I have ever encountered at any restaurant. Service was extremely slow, we waited 45 minutes to receive our first meal with a party of four.  To make matters worst one entree was wrong and it took the kitchen forenever to bring the dish. That's right I said forenever because it never came.  Out of respect for my two daughters I didn't get raise my voice nor lose my cool even though I was beyond pissed about the whole dinner experience.  The manager did remove the missing entree from our bill and gave me a 25% discount but ruined my daughters celebration dinner.  Epic fail Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena
Abigail N.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,23,1,1.0,1/7/2018,"I used to LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. So as a treat I decided to order in using Postmates. Sadly two of the four things i ordered ""weren't available"" and the only vegetable I was left with, the grilled asparagus, was the WORST vegetable dish i've ever had. They were rubbery and had absolutely NO FLAVOR! Didn't even looked grilled. More like steamed. Definitely not worth the $ price tag. Sad to say but i think the Cheesecake Factory has seen it's day, and it's long gone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena

Li Shan W.,"Los Angeles, CA",605,23,28,2.0,1/3/2018,"I was really unhappy with the service here. I came here as a part of a party of 2 on a Saturday night at around 5:20pm. We were seated within 15 minutes but then spent 30 minutes just sitting at the table trying to flag a waiter down. 30 MINUTES of sitting there, we weren't even served any water or bread. I must've talked to two different workers there but they would just brush me off and tell me that they would find someone. Several of the tables that were seated after us were served first and it was incredibly frustrating. When our food finally did come, it was good (maybe because I had waited at least 45 minutes longer than expected and at that point was ravenous and anything would've tasted good). We ordered the Da Vinci pasta and a spaghetti bolognaise.  I wish I could give this Cheesecake Factory a higher score but the service was absolutely appalling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena

Julie U.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",4,24,15,1.0,11/13/2017,"I took take out last night for two pastas and the total with tip came out to about $43  We ordered the carbonara with chicken and the chicken bellagio.  1 STAR for the QUALITY. My friend and I tasted our respective pastas and found that they were EXTREMELY BLAND. We had to try and add salt and pepper to salvage the taste. We were incredibly disappointed because Cheesecake Factory is a well-known ""higher class"" chain. We found that we could have made the pasta better tasting and for a far cheaper price. The whole meal tasted bland of cheap quality and I feel completely ripped off. The pasta is way too oiled and the chicken tastes as though it's from McDonald's or a restaurant a bit of higher quality.  THE WAIT: it took about 35 minutes for us to receive our food upon our request of asking for it. I had previously asked for bread and butter but the workers didn't include the butter nor any napkins.  The problem isn't as much the price as the quality. I go to republique in Downtown LA where the pastas are $40 each and my boyfriend and I each order one for ourselves but the quality makes up for the high price.  Overall, we don't plan on returning for over-priced, bland food that isn't worth the price.  Here is a photo of my food halfway after I ate it. Overly greasy, oiled, and plan - very unappetizing for its price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena
LeRoy W.,"Corona, CA",3,27,28,3.0,12/27/2017,"Stopped in for lunch. Wednesday afternoon. Not too busy... food was good, as it should be for the price.  Had the breakfast burrito. Good balanced flavors. Not 'hot' at all. We also had the Brioche Breakfast sandwich. Good.  Service was sub-par, but it cold have just been our server. We don't usually come down this way, but if I come back I'll ask for a window table... that area gets better attention. Parking is close walk on Fair Oaks & first 90 min is free... plan on paying if you have to wait for your waitress though. ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena
Cynthia H.,"San Diego, CA",78,109,60,4.0,10/29/2017,"I personally feel like food-wise you know what you are getting yourself into. I feel that way with a lot of chain restaurants. Few things really differentiate one branch from another. This was my second time at this location. My boyfriend and I go to the nearest Cheesecake Factory every year for our anniversary (this is our 6th time total).  Service was not unforgettable, I have a pretty good threshold for it as I feel like I am not always in need of something. Our wait on a Friday night was only 15 minutes or so and the food was cooked awesomely. Farfalle bow tie pasta and the lemon piccata with angel hair is a must. Both delicious and creamy pastas that I can't forget. We also got the banana cheesecake (our second time having it, it's a fresh fave) and also the lemon raspberry which was even better than I expected.  I knew what to expect going in especially since this was our 6th cheesecake factory visit, and nothing turned me off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena

Elle02__ M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,33,2.0,10/27/2017,"So the one in Glendale is by far the worst one!! Don't ever go there. Even if you're in the area.  As far as the restaurant goes, I would recommend to stray from ordering any kind of steaks. My boyfriend ordered a steak once and it was dry, I have to a long time ago, and it was also dry and overlooked. But they're not a Steakhouse. So didn't expect much... I've had the miso salmon which I think is good. I also like the shrimp scampi but if you're not a garlic person, I'd avoid it.  The chicken costoletta,The flatbread pizza, are good... I've had other dishes but can't remember the names, so I'll leave it at that.  Overall, I think food is alright. Nothing too good but not too bad. The best part about the Cheesecake Factory is indeed the Cheesecake. Try the banana cream one, it's the best one!!!  The staff are very attentive, there is little to no wait. You are seated quickly. Food is brought out hot not cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena
Kevin W.,"Temple City, CA",501,1795,7849,3.0,6/27/2017,"The original Cheesecake Factory in SGV. This location has been here for years. It used to be the most popular restaurant in Old Town. Always packed during rush hours, lunch and dinner.  Looks small from the outside but it is pretty big inside. Park at the School House lot, first 90 minutes free! Menu is so overwhelming. They have so much to choose from.  Chinese Chicken Salad - $14.95 - My usual go to dish here. I like the combination of the salad toppings they use. The chicken are nothing special but when you combine it with the toppings and plum dressing, its so good! The plum dressing makes this salad amazing! Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club - $14.50 - Chicken was juicy and tender. You get a ton of avocado. The bacon, tomato, and cheese all were great in the sandwich. Only negative was that the bread was super oily.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena
Mary H.,"Altadena, CA",453,160,457,3.0,5/11/2017,"Came here the other evening with my parents. It was only a 10 minute wait for the 3 of us around 6:30 pm.  I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times. I typically order the four cheese pasta or the falafel salad from the superfoods menu. This time I ordered a couple things off of the ""skinnylicious"" menu. They were out of the grilled artichoke that I wanted.  I got the endive salad and the ahi tartare. Both were pretty good. They were off of the small plates menu but they were very small. And for $7-8 each I thought they were a bit on the expensive side for what they were. But they did taste pretty good.  The service was quite slow. It took longer than normal for our food to come out and they also forgot things when they brought out our food. My mom's tacos were missing the crema that comes on the side. I ordered my dressing on the side and they had to bring that separate as well. It just felt a little disorganized.  Next time I'll probably get the falafel salad and save some for later since it's so huge. The only downside is that if you want to add meat to your salad/food, it can be really expensive for the quality of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena
Kokoa T.,"Pasadena, CA",118,49,83,4.0,9/21/2017,"I can't believe this is my first Cheesecake Factory review. I love this place. I used to get their shrimp and bacon club sandwich but sadly, they removed it from the menu. HUGE MISTAKE! I boycotted for a year before their Chicken Picatta pulled me in. Then their appetizer crab cake balls (forgot the name) quickly became a routine favorite. While on disability some months back, I tried their Philly Cheesesteak and again, delish! It's like this place can do no wrong food wise.  Recently I took another visit and got their CA Cheesesteak. I had to make some changes because I'm picky and oooo weeee, again, delish! Not a fan of cheese sauce so I substituted for garlic mayo. Because I love cheese, I asked for extra cheese. The sandwich was delivered to the table looking ooey and gooey and I was too happy! A side of bleu cheese dressing for my french fries and I was SET for dinner!  Our waiter, I think his name was Ray, at least that's what my friend kept calling him lol, was fantastic!! He showed much patience with our indecisiveness and substitutions, then he showed his sense of humor as well. He was great. We couldn't wait to give him a 20% tip. We normally give 20% anyway but Ray, he deserved way more. Budgets, however, were at play lol.  Other than parking not being so friendly since I'm not an Old Town Pasadena fan, I love this place. So far, they have done me no wrong except removing the shrimp and bacon club sandwich. That was just pure evilness. I still have an affinity for The Cheesecake Factory and it's not because of their cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena
Vincent Artemio E.,"Monterey Park, CA",67,126,624,5.0,9/27/2017,"If there are so many eclectic and diverse dining choices in Pasadena, why should you visit The Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena?

Nice spacious booths  Comfortable decor.  We were able to feel a part of the restaurant but also feel like we were at a private party.  Our waitress was wonderful.

Susan A.,"Easton, PA",5,177,29,5.0,10/14/2017,"We generally enjoy the Cheesecake Factory-the wide selection of menu items means that everyone can usually find something.

Our waiter wasn't around after the food was ordered (he seemed to get a lot of tables all at once) and we didn't feel like going to the hassle of sending them back. This was not a bad experience , just not the best we've had at a restaurant we've grown to love in part because of their consistency.   Update: wow-brunch menu is amazing. The brûléed french toast is a must!!! Crispy on the outside and tasty on the inside with a buttery syrup. The avacado toast is lovely-the little pickled onions really make it.

So at this point i am LIVID because I can't eat the food and now i have to drive to Cheesecake Factory and look for parking and pay for parking.

I work nearby so I walked over which took me ten minutes. So my food should have been ready, by half hour time. I arrive and this guy Sammy is scrambling to find my order ticket, turns out HE NEVER PLACED THE ORDER. So he apologizes a bunch of times because he didn't do his job correctly. And on top of that doesn't offer to get a manager to discount our entire meal. Maybe he didn't want to get in trouble with management for this huge mistake that was entirely his fault, so he doesn't offer to have a manager come and fix it. His apology should suffice right? No. It doesn't because I already waited a half hour for my food and then I had to sit in store and wait another 15 minutes to receive the food I was originally coming to simply PICK UP. Then I get back to my office, give my boss her food, which included a soup of the day that when I called was told that it was the 'Mexican Chicken', turns out it was clam chowder, MY BOSS IS ALLERGIC TO CLAMS. We call the manager of the restaurant to discuss all that has happened, he agrees to refund us because my boss starts to have an allergic reaction, but never apologizes for all that has occurred. I go back into the restaurant and the manager just gets me the refund, no trying to apologize for the terrible mistake.

This is a Cheesecake Factory with typical interior decor; however, it seemed a little bit smaller than many locations.   Our table began with an order of the chicken nachos.  For my entree, I personally had the Cobb Salad replacing the tomatoes with beets.  Both of these items were excellent.   For dessert, I shared a slice of the Hazlenut Cheesecake with one other person, and as always the cheesecake was absolutely delicious. The only reason for the slightly less than perfect rating is that the server we had for the first half of our dining experience clearly didn't want to be there and was just clearly not loving her job.   She identified herself as a replacement server filling in for someone who was on her dinner break.  Once our regular server returned, everything was quite nice again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=20
Kevin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,2.0,1/4/2018,"Came in on a Thursday around 2p.m and it was still a pretty decent sized lunch crowd. Good thing was that it was just my friend and I so we didn't have to wait long.. We got seated within 5 minutes and that was when it went downhill from there. I always give restaurants the benefits of the doubt because I too am in the Food / Beverage Hospitality Management field. 10 minutes passed by and I didn't mind because I still haven't made a decision on what I wanted but my friend came in starving. Another 10 minutes passed by and my friend was slowly getting ticked off so she flagged a random server down. I'm not the type of person to do that because it was understandable since it was busy. Our server came by and asked what we would like to drink. Once our drinks were placed, she asked if we wanted Bread and Butter and we politely said yes and told her that we were also ready to order. My friend got a Mushroom Burger and I got the Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken. 15 minutes passed by and my friend started getting grumpy. She flagged down a random server to check up on our food because our server was no where to be found. 10 minutes later, the person we flagged brought our food out. Boy, were we hungry. My friend asked her for burger medium rare and it came out well done and cold, and my green beans were way undercooked, it was rubbery and it had no flavors, but to be honest, we were too hungry to say anything.

Ben A.,"Arcadia, CA",4325,743,1968,4.0,12/17/2016,"After finding the One Colorado Santa had packed it in for the rainstorm the other day (lame, btw) we returned to the parking structure with three disappointed kids to discover a fender bender between a UPS truck and a small car had thoroughly blocked and destroyed traffic on Union St.  Since we weren't going anywhere for a while, and the kids were hungry anyway, we decided to walk down the street to Cheesecake Factory. For whatever reason I always seem to have a gift card or two for this restaurant (#educatorsFTW).  Walking into an old town Pasadena restaurant with three kids under eight on a Thursday night isn't my idea of a good time, but unlike some of the other competing places in the area, we were able to pull it off here.  Mrs. Picante and I ordered off the Skinnylicious menu: Greek salads and lettuce wrap tacos were both small, but satisfying.  The dipping sauces on the tacos were pretty salty, but tasty. 6 to 8 dollars a plate isn't a bad deal, even for appetizers. The kids had assorted fare of macaroni and cheese, quesadillas, and picking olives out of my salad.  Service was pretty good for a rainy night, and the kids were actually pretty well behaved.  Pro parent tip: this restaurant is plenty loud enough to cover the occasional whining, yelling, screaming, or other assorted noises that children make.   By the time everyone had eaten, the accident has cleared, and we were on our way. Still have to figure out how to get our Santa photographs with the kids taken, but at least we got out as a family on a traditional old town Pasadena date night, and didn't bother anyone else's good time...

Aleah W.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,60,16,2.0,7/14/2017,"I happened to have some time to kill and was hungry. I also had a gift card I figured I'd take advantage of.  First of all five stars for service. The bartender was really awesome. I forget her name but she was super friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. She was also really amazing at dealing with the dbag sitting at the bar being obnoxious towards her.  The food I wish I could give zero stars. There weren't near as many healthy options as I had hoped for. And the one salad that looked appealing, tuna tataki, was insanely overpriced at $19. Tender Greens doesn't even charge that much for their Tuna Niçoise salad.  I ordered the skinnyliscious veggie burger. It came with a side salad. The side salad was only lettuce and tasted like chemicals. I immediately spit it out. I proceeded to eat the burger. It was ok. I didn't have high expectations for a ""skinnylicious"" veggie burger at the Cheesecake Factory.  The issue was shortly after with the pains I felt in my stomach. I don't think I had full on food poisoning but there was something definitely not ok with the burger.  There are way better, healthier, and budget friendlier options in the area.

After that we were given bread, which was kinda stale and old. And then we had to wait over 30 minutes for our food to actually come out.  VEGAN OPTIONS- a humongous vegan Cobb salad- almonds are phenomenal, avocado fantastic, solid salad. Make sure to mix it up.

The shrimp alfredo was okay, not as flavorful. We also got drinks and I believe I ordered the Strawberry Daiquiri and that was really good! I do not really like to taste the alcohol and it masked it very well! I highly recommend that drink! The service was good, but a little slow since there was a lot of people on a Friday night.

Crystlhrt M.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",33,42,7,2.0,5/22/2017,"I picked Cheesecake Factory for a milestone birthday dinner last night with friends. I'm really sad about my choice.  It started with trying to make a reservation for 6pm on Sunday. I was curtly told I needed to call  back for a same day reservation, advance reservations are not made for Saturday/Sunday. I called back on Sunday as directed - about 11:30am. I was then told they only take reservations during the first hour. When I asked the hostess on the phone where I could find that information (on the website, etc.), she was confused, then flustered, then, being asked again, she said she was new and didn't know.  We had a mix-up of some kind on being called to our table. The cell phone was rung, then we were sent back to the bar for another 10 minutes. We'd already closed our bar tab, I'm not sure what the mix-up was, since I was the birthday girl, I didn't get involved. I was just glad our spots were still available. Overall, our wait was just over the quoted 30-40 minutes.  After a very long delay (shorthanded???), our table-ordered cocktails arrived - after the hot appetizers and my martini included an eyelash or similar. (It didn't have mascara on it, so it didn't come from any of us.) The wait for drinks, including the replacement, was quite long and without explanation. The only drink our server was on top of, was coffee for one of us. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT was that, even with the extensive menu, it was a challenge to find something for one of our group that has serious food allergies. No potatoes beyond french fries without dairy?!?!? We were told the smashed potatoes contained sour cream, and there is no baked potato option. Broccoli is great - but not exactly an indulgement.  The final straw was that at the end of our meal, we were approached by a previously-unseen employee, all in black, who abruptly asked ""Do you need something else?"" as though we were in the way. We were actually waiting for the additional ""To Go"" food one of us ordered as well as our packed up leftovers. Our actual server had nicely offered to keep them together in back until we were finished and ready to go. The employee was told why were waiting, he took off before we'd finished getting the words out and then returned and essentially through 8 bags of food at us. Talk about a sour taste being left. :(  That final exchange - his tacky, disrespectful approach to us after we spent close to $100 each, inspired this review. I sincerely doubt I'll return to this, or any other, Cheesecake Factory in the future. It makes me sad since I usually meet friends once every month or two at various ones near different friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=40

I ordered a strawberry lemonade and they gave it to me in a kids size cup. I always go to the Brea location and they always give it to me in a large cup which was triple the size of that tiny cup I received. So I asked about it and she said they only give it in that cup. I did not pay $3 for a tiny drink so at this point I was so frustrated and hangry. I wasn't even in the mood to argue with them so I just left. I got back to my place and my chicken nachos was missing the chicken!

Lore D.,"Glendale, CA",6,51,,3.0,5/5/2017,"It's a long story, but Hubs and I ended up with $100.00 worth of gift certificates to the Cheesecake Factory. Hence, the following review. Every store in this chain has seemed overly ""grand"" IMHO, and this one is no exception.  The aftetnoon we lunched there we witnessed no less than three birthday parties. This is clearly a popular spot for the office workers of Old Town.  We were seated quickly in a nice cozy booth. Our server was professional and efficient. Hubs and I were confused by the three (3) menus with their numerous and often redundant choices. I found the caloric values of the dishes to be discouraging and off-putting, to say the least. I don't want to be told that the fish and chips is 1800 calories. I don't want a guilt trip or a Weight Watchers lecture from a restaurant whose stock-in-trade is cheesecake, for crying out loud.  WTF is this anyway? Might as well have a disclsimer saying ""welcome fatsos, to our fattening emporium of fatty fatness,  and now for a very special episode of ""My 600 lb Life"" We started with the famous avocado egg rolls, which were amazing and disappeared quickly. Hubs ordered the Seared Ahi plate, which was fundamentally the same thing as my Tuna Tataki salad. Both dishes were en pointe, tasty and surprisingly filling, considering the relative lowness of their respective caloric values.  Both entrees were priced around $20.00, and with our gift certificates,  were an even better value at free. At this point in the meal, our server went on break. The guy covering for her was pretty douchey. I didn't appreciate him trying to take our bread away. By all means, clear our table but first ask if we're done with something before you just yank it away. Manners! You know how I love me some bread. Douchey substitute server also delivered my Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake  without a fresh, clean fork. Or any fork for that matter. Lucky for me that I still had a clean spoon left. Hubs used his remaining fork to help me polish off the dessert, which was creamy, dense, and luscious as cheesecake should be. I love me some cheesecake. Sigh. In all, the food was very, very good, albeit somewhat expensive, despite not having ordered any adult beverages.

Why...??  Well, I get to enjoy a nice environment with my little cutie pies AND eat their food!!!  LOL.  Unfortunately, my little ones have taken after their father and are extremely picky eaters (my wife totally despises me for it lol).  So, being that they are picky eaters and one of them can't really talk yet, I come up with a master plan to buy four different kids meals for all of us to share... typically I'll choose two really good/healthy ones like grilled chicken and grilled salmon and two not so healthy ones (which of course are the ones we all love) like mac n cheese, spaghetti, or pizza.  So our table has a bunch of random plates of different foods along with the bread...  Thankfully when we came to this location the waitress was really sweet.  She totally knew how chaotic it could be with three kids and no adult (I'm the third kid, lol)... And she totally took care of us!!  Oddly enough my youngest ONLY eats the complimentary brown oat bread sticks out of all four plates that I order.  My daughter usually finishes a good half a plate and the rest is for daddy to take down.... Yay for me!  Out of all the cheesecake factory's that I've been to, I have to say that this is one of the better ones.  I don't know if the waitress has kids and understands or not, but she was on point with getting me exactly what I needed when I asked for it.  Many other cheesecake factory's that I've been to just don't understand that kids only have a small time span until they start getting crazy and the only thing on the table to play with is forks and knives (for those that are worried... dont worry... I supervise them while they play with forks and knives!  LOL j/k).  Honestly, compared to other cheesecake factory's, our waitress at this location was great, she brought out the food quickly, she brought our more bread when I mentioned that my little one only likes their bread and on top of great service, their food is great!!

It did not take long to be seated, we went in at around 4:20 and seated immediately. We got window seats which was splendid. My only down side is the utensils were dirty and so was our table. Besides that, I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken, I was able to make it a lunch plate so that's a plus. The pasta was delicious and the bread they offer was amazing as well! I also ordered an original cheesecake which I might add didn't strike me to be all that good, I've definitely tasted better. The only reason I give them a four star is due to the dirty table and utensils, besides that service was amazing and I can't wait to go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=60

Drew C.,"Pasadena, CA",110,150,490,3.0,12/8/2015,"A good place to get your grub on if the wait isn't longer than 30 minutes, which is almost never.... I came here with a party of 8, and the wait was atrocious. They quoted us around hour, it ended up being two..... I wasn't feeling adventurous so I just got the Classic Burger with cheddar cheese. It's a typical burger with lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, and sauce served with a side of French fries. Large portioned and juicy, not a bad choice for those not in the mood for pasta or anything else. I also stole a bit of my friends steak Diane with shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta substituted for the mashed potatoes. The steak was juicy and tender and the shrimp scampi was full of flavor, not too salty. For dessert we decided on a chocoate mousse cheesecake. Now normally I'm not a fan of cheesecake at all, but holy crap the chocolate mousse was the perfect way to end the meal. Food is a solid 4 stars, but I have to subtract a star for the absurd wait time.

I know this is a chain but Cheesecake Factory has a hefty price tag attached to their food. You come here expecting decent service and food you enjoy. I ordered the lunch portion of the shrimp and sausage pasta. It seriously looked like the cook just flopped a ton of pasta on the plate with a glob of sauce on one side and four over cooked shrimp. The sausage was fine though. Our waiter only checked in on us once post meal. I had to put the menus on the bench next to me and dirty silverware which fell on the floor (had to approach another waiter for replacements) next to it. Even when waiting for the check the waiter was just not caring. I had to raise my arm three hands to try to flag him down, which he turned his back to, and then had to get up out of seat which finally caught his attention.

My meal was so so. I did not like how the filet mignon tasted. It seemed a bit too salted, and the cut was not right. There is not much to expect from the taste of broccoli, other than the Parmesan cheese I requested on top added a nice taste to it. The service was alright, but they need to prepare their filet mignon better. I asked for rare, but I got more of a medium/well. I never eat steak in any way other than rare.

There are almost too many options, the menu book is a little overwhelming, however this problem would likely be an advantage of going with a group.  They provide complimentary bread and butter that's pretty tasty, but be sure to pace yourself.

The mashed potatoes were more like smashed potatoes. - SHRIMP SCAMPI AND CHICKEN MADEIRA The chicken madeira is smothered with mozzarella and a beautiful sweet dark madeira wine sauce. The shrimp scampi is pretty yums as well. The breaded large shrimp is pan fried and then covered in this delicious garlic sauce. I wish they'd leave out the breading as it becomes a bit gummy/thick after it sits in the sauce too long. - MANGO KEY LIME CHEESECAKE Nice and tart. I'm not sure if this is a new item. Make sure to ask for extra whip cream.  I had whispered to the waitress before the meal that it was sis' bday. She said they only give out a free sundae (?) or something?

Wait times are long and the servers run from table to table. Because of this, I've been calling for pickup to just get the food. Unfortunately, the pick up option convenience is now getting worse.  When I called in the food, they told me 20 mins and it'd be ready. I got there 25 mins later and paid, but my food wasn't ready. There were three ""Door Dash"" guys in front of me waiting for their food. Long story short, I waited for another 25 mins (and after asking the worker twice to look into my order).

So undercooked as to be embarrassing. My dish of fish tacos was just odd. The tortillas were radically undersized. Your supposed to get a whole evolution of flavor and mouth feel out of a taco impossible since you had to take most of it out with a fork that was badly bent in my case. I have never had a street or truck taco that was such a joke. Attractive as it all was flavor counts too. The rice served with it was apparently drizzled with 40wt motor oil. I know what that smells like having an antique car. It made me ill. I never had this kind of atrocity at any other location. I had a great experience three times in a row at the one in Cucamonga. All of the restaurants out their are superior to anything in Pasadena once a foodie paradise. My kids barley at half of what they were served. They always finish what I make them and they go get more. Shame on this location. Waste of my money and worse my time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=100

We've never had bad service here! Menu--huge selection.. I have trouble deciding what to eat here and it's really annoying. I always have to do the process of elimination cause I have trouble choosing between 5 entrees. Everything just sound soo goooddddd After being here over 50 times....... here are my suggestions: Appetizer: Fried Mac N Cheese-- SOOOOO good omg. Fills you up like crazy, though.. Caesar salad is also amazing. Their dressing is garlic-y so if you hate garlic.... stay away. Nachos, avocado egg rolls, spinach and artichoke dip... delicious. Entree: My recent favorite has been the southwest chicken sandwich.. My favorite sandwich besides the california cheesesteak. The spicy chipotle chicken pasta is also one of my top choices!

Jeff S.,"South Pasadena, CA",11,4,2,1.0,12/24/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain that my lady and I frequent often. Always 100% satisfied with the service and the food.  On this night however, that sentiment changed, drastically for the worse.  My wife and I were out for a walk in Old Town after Christmas Eve dinner. My wife is 8 months pregnant, so frequent bathroom breaks are a part of life. We walked over to the Paseo, bathrooms closed. From there, we walked to the small courtyard in between Sephora and Crate & Barrel, also closed. After that distance of a walk and to no avail, it is now a bathroom code red!  We walk back out on to Colorado Blvd. and see The Cheesecake Factory is open. We just knew they'd let us use the bathroom. No questions or doubts about it.  WRONG! (Slightly) The time is now 10:30. We walk in and approach the host's counter were we are greeted by Joanna (I'm pretty sure that was her name). My wife asks to use the bathroom and explains quickly that we haven't been able to find and use another. Joanna allows her to use the bathroom but only after making my wife feel stupid for asking by saying: ""But you know, there are public restrooms behind Sephora."" What!? Thanks for the unnecessary comment. WE ALREADY TRIED THAT!  Honestly, that was RUDE! Better to have said no and saved us the feeling of stupidity.  I was already planning on getting us a slice of cake, but now I felt obligated!  Not cool. I understand it's Christmas Eve, but there's never an excuse for such rude, poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=100

Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717,3.0,2/20/2015,"What has happened to Cheesecake Factory? I have dined at this location here and there when I was in high school (that was 10-15 years ago). But have dined at other Cheesecake Factory locations over the years and am sad to see that the food quality has gone down hill within the last few years. Anyways, on my most recent visit to this location (yesterday afternoon around 2 pm for a late light lunch), my husband and I were seated at a small table near the kitchen. These are the items we ordered: Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, $10.95 prior to tax- My husband wanted something light since he had a big (late) breakfast and decided upon these spring rolls. I had low expectations for these spring rolls because with an American restaurant making spring rolls, I just had a feeling they wouldn't be good. And well, my suspicions were correct. These 3 rolls (pretty expensive for 3) were poorly wrapped and the wrong type of noodles were used in them. Also these summer rolls are supposed to have shrimp. Only one roll had 1 shrimp and the other 2 had none. I did like the peanut flavored sauce and the sweet chili sauce that came with the rolls though (these are the same sauces that come with the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which my husband should have ordered in the first place because that actually taste good, although it is not a light appetizer). Luau Salad (Lunch portion), $10.95 prior to tax- The lunch portion size (you can order lunch portions until 5 pm) is actually a good size for one person (I shared part of my salad with my husband). The presentation of this salad was pretty. It comes with 2 large fried won ton pieces. It isn't exactly healthy so I didn't finish it.  Whenever I order a salad, I always order for the dressing to be on the side. In this salad, there are pieces of mango, cucumber slices, sliced bell peppers, green beans, macadamia nuts and sesame seeds. The sweetness of the mango was good enough that this salad didn't need the dressing (I had a little of the dressing and it does go well with the salad, just in case you are someone who just has to have dressing on your salad). I love the different textures, flavors and crunch. Strawberry Lemonade, $3.95 prior to tax- This lemonade was pretty bad. The lemonade tasted too sour and tasted as if rotten fruit was made with it. When we got a 2nd glass, it still had the same taste. The reason being was that our server just ladled out the drink from a large container that was already premade (so our 1st glass wouldn't taste any different from the 2nd until someone makes a new batch... but I bet it will still taste the same).  ------------------------------ (Total= $34.95 after tax and tip)  Service was just average and really could have been better attentive (especially it being in the late afternoon when the restaurant was not busy). Food was not that great, especially for the price. Do not see ourselves coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=120

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Blasts and a Pineapple Moscow Mule. My friend ordered the rib eye. The Mule was basically just Pineapple juice. No ginger and barely any vodka. The Blasts were basically just pure fried grease with barely any chicken or cheese, and the Buffalo sauce I think was just straight Frank's Red Hot without any butter or anything to cut it. Way too spicy and concentrated. I ended up with the worst acid reflux (which I've never gotten) and my friend ended up in the bathroom right after we left with some really bad stomach problems.

He only smiled at the end and said something funny when we were paying. The food was awful. My friend ordered their cheese stick which she hated and don't even finish. I ordered the Nashville hot chicken nuggets and mini crab cakes. I love crab cakes, but these were greasy and not firm. I couldn't grab them at all. I put a lot of tartar sauce on the crab bites to get some flavor. The chicken nuggets came out late. They were the only thing that was hot, but the bottom side of each piece wasn't coated in hot sauce. The top barely had enough to get the red color on the chicken. I forgot to mention that the bread was cold and the butter was so cold that it wasn't spreadable.

Esther K.,"Arcadia, CA",315,826,2224,4.0,1/2/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is always packed! It is not surprising to see the crowd of waiting people go out the door here, especially at dinner time. It is pretty crazy, especially considering how much seating they have available inside. It is a large restaurant! Parking is either street parking or one of the public parking lots; the one I usually park at is just a block away on Green. The last time I came here, I was with JC and we were seated at a table on the Fair Oaks side, with large windows letting in a ton of natural light. My favourite part about coming to The Cheesecake Factory is their complimentary bread! I usually always love white bread more than brown bread, but this place is the exception. Both breads are delicious, but there is something extra addicting about the brown bread. So good! My friend ordered an omelette with potatoes and even more brown bread! I don't remember which omelette she got but she liked it. I just ate a few of her potatoes and that was it. I ordered their BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad: Avocado, Tomato, Grilled Corn, Black Beans, Cucumber and Romaine All Tossed with Our Barbeque Ranch Dressing; Topped with Lots of Crispy Fried Onion Strings for Crunch. It was really good! Next time I would get it without black beans, but I liked everything else. I really liked that they added onion strings to the salad, yum! The portion sizes here are large so I had enough salad leftover to bring home. Combine that with the leftover bread from our second basket and I had enough for another meal. I have to admit that I was not always a big fan of this chain restaurant, but I have since changed my tune and now I love it.

He ordered a Cesar salad and I ordered a French country salad and added salmon to it. The salads took forever to come out and once they did, I asked the food runner what the hold up was and he explained that the first piece of fish was overly cooked so they had to fire it up again. Anyway, we had waited for so long as this point that I was already beyond annoyed. Then I hungrily dug into my salad and omg it was AWFUL!!! Omg awful so bad I spit out the super salty beet into my napkin. I let the server know it was gross when she checked on us and that I had waited forever on food already and so she had the manager come over. The manager was a lady named Loretta and she was WONDERFUL. I was so damn pissed and disappointment by the wait and the salad but she was soooo cool and understanding and comforting. She took the salad off the check and offered to bring out anything that sounded good to me. I thought about it and was over the idea of eating anything else but in the end I left pleased and impressed that Loretta handled the situation and my crappy attitude like a true professional. She's an exemplary manager and truly truly truly made the difference in my experience. The check was less than 30 bucks so it wasn't the money but it was her willingness and true care to make sure the guest leaves happy. No questions asked Cheesecake Factory Pasadena is lucky to have a lady like Loretta on their management team because had the situation been dealt with in another manner I can assure you I would've left pissed and left 1 star.

I wanted to ask to move but we sat there... waiting...waiting... waiting. Finally, being that it was so late I figured we could grab another booth in a warmer area, I got up and moved to the same size booth with my wife.  All of the sudden within minutes the host shows up telling me ""this section is closed"". I asked him to get the manager and he went off to get her.  He came back and said she was too busy with an employee right now.  He offered to move us to another booth and I reluctantly excepted.  There we sat waiting again. The place seemed to have enough staff to run a good operation but the only one's who se med to be working hard were the servers.  I have worked in this business 20 years and I work in what I would call the best restaurants in Pasadena if not Southern California.  Maybe I'm bias but I usually way over tip and truly enjoy good service.  Mind you the manager still hadn't come to my table. We finally ordered and at this point I just wanted to leave.  The food finally showed up and they placed a burger in front of me I would even feed to my dog. The bun was made from that brown bread with the oatmeal on the outside and i pretty much choked just looking at it. I could basically smell how dry it tasted.  I showed the waitress and she even agreed it usually comes out on a sourdough baguette.  I gave it back to her and when it returned it had obviously been sloppily re-stacked on the sourdough bread.  A slimy tomato was hanging out the side and there was a new slice of cheese thrown in there. (Not even melted). By this time the meet was cold after one bite I had had enough.  I told the server upon her asking me, ""I don't want this"". She said she'd make sure it was taken off the bill.  All of the sudden a manager shows up and states, "" I understand you had an issue with a burger?"" I told him I had asked to see a manager about an hour ago and I was told they were too busy.  I also told him their is nothing he could say to me to change the impression I got from this Cheescake Factory.  It amazes me that people eat here.  It is amateur at best.  There is no sincerity and everyone follows protocol like robots.  I should ha e gone to Coco's which was one of our options at 9:40pm.  If you're open until 11pm you should act like it.  I will never step foot in another Cheesecake Factory in all my life.  I feel sorry for the servers too it's a shame because to be honest the potential is their just not the compassion for wanting it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=160

The frozen iced mango is also delicious if you're looking for a cool, non alcoholic drink option... but no one is really looking for that :-) The food is consistent as is the service.

Esther W.,"Carlsbad, CA",208,183,384,5.0,6/28/2014,"Okay, so I figure it's time to write a review on the Cheesecake factory, and the reviews here on yelp are sort of random. This is 5 stars because of the food and only the foos. Yes lines can be long, but i've been there close to Saturday midnight and Sunday evening, and we were seated right away (party less than 4).  Yes your waiter can be a bit of an ass. One waiter actually checked up on us, another time they sort of ignored us, but it didn't bother me. All the tables around us were full, and they kept filling up, so I can understand it can be a little hectic. But there is also amazing service, very fast with the bread (just request the black bread dammit) and helpful with selection. Hell they're also great to call- I lost an item and the front desk was so sweet about it! Anyways, I won't let a bit of bad service get in the way of the 5 stars-- because the food is freaking amazing! This is a great spot for dinner or lunch, the portions are huge, appetizer and entree alike, and the cheesecake makes for a great slice!  An entree I highly recommend is the eggplant burger. Yes you heard me, eggplant. If you've had enough burgers as I have, bison or angus, it's definitely nice to eat something else. The Cheesecake Factory's eggplant burger is definitely a unique treat. It's a huge burger, extremely savory and fulfilling. The side of fries is also very very generously portioned. Instantly loved! For sides, I've tasted the quesadillas, nacho chips with buffalo (?) chicken and the sweet potato fries. The chips platter was insanely huge, definitely worth it if you just want to snack with another person. It was extremely savory, you get chicken, salsa, guac, and all the cheese ever. The quesadillas were a bit small/thin, but nevertheless tasty. And lastly the sweet potato fries... No regrets. It was another huge plate of just sweet potato fries. Top notch, soft, fresh, salty and sweet, doesn't taste that oily. And lastly for the Cheesecake I taste: the something something Tuxedo cheesecake. Hahah I forgot the name oops, but I was already hooked on the fact it was called Tuxedo! It was chocolate, vanilla, and more chocolate! It did not taste bland or dull or stale, it melted in your mouth it was a sweet delight and it was damn fancy good. If you're gonna be at the Cheesecake Factory, order a fancy cheesecake right? Anyways, the dinners I've had here have been more than fulfilling (yes you can box it. In fact you'll probably box your leftovers) and very delicious.

Let's just say my craving was satisfied. The cocktails are always delicious so they get a good rating in that are.  The only thing that was disappointing is that the beer glasses we were given smelled TERRIBLE!  I don't know if they were washed thoroughly but they STANK!  Also, the floors were so ridiculously slippery so they either had the floors waxed recently or they were that dirty.

It took 30 minutes to get seated at 4pm, another 15 before we saw a server, 10 for our drinks (and one glass was dirty), 30 for the appetizer and another 20 for our entrees. By the end of the meal, it was an over 2-hour event. The food was off tonight. We got the jambalaya pasta and the texture just screamed ""overcooked"" on every element. The shrimp and chicken were hard and dry, the veggies were way too soft and the pasta was mushy. We also had the ribeye steak because it was just one of those nights where you felt like ordering steak at the Cheesecake Factory. The meat was tough though cooked to our desired doneness. Our waitress was as nice as can be and these two stars are for her. I know she sensed our frustration. She kept apologizing but she was stretched thin at the start of the dinner service already. Poor girl. I know I'm not going to be having a 5-star experience at a Cheesecake Factory and most especially not this location since I've been here many times but tonight was just exceptionally bad.

Whether it's a mom & pop or a corporate chain, you just can't deny good food! ...and Yes, Cheesecake Factory whether you  like it or not has some hands down pretty darn delicious lean and mean dishes! We arrived at the Cheesecake factory anticipating a long line, surprisingly eventhough there was quite a few of us waiting to be seated (it's a Friday night mind you) we didn't have to wait long.  Service was okay, our server took our drink orders while we browsed the menu; It's one of those night that calls for a flavor packed dish - ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta!"" This very generous serving of Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a spicy cajun sauce really hit my cravings for tonight, I love how the spices did not over power each other giving this dish a nice balance between heat, flavor and spice. Served on top of Linguini pasta, this dish will sure fill you up! It's really good! When you are at the Cheesecake Factory - you MUST save room for dessert! A slice of Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake for my friend and a slice of the Original Cheesecake for me! ""Sharing is caring"" we split up our cheesecakes so that we could both have a taste of this sinfully delicious slices! Absolutely divine! The Chocolate Mousse cheesecake felt light and airy yet so rich and decadent! The Original Cheesecake in my opinion was pretty darn good - just the right amount of sweetness, a slight hint of tart, creamy and overall just decadent. I LoVE it! We had such good time at the Cheesecake Factory, Delicious dishes and amazing desserts, I really didn't mind the short wait, there's plenty of visual distractions in the waiting area - cheesecakes of every size and color, cakes layered so high and looked so sinfully good!!!

Bo L.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,288,333,1.0,9/7/2015,"READ THIS 1ST (you can read the rest if you want or not. It doesn't matter. It's not like Yelp pays me to write.)  I remember seeing this food documentary that showed how huge food companies try to make their food as sweet as possible so that it tastes good and is addicting. That is what I feel The Cheesecake Factory is. It's use of cheap overly used sugar keeps you coming back for more.  If you come here, you're only wasting your own time and money.  REST OF THE REVIEW BELOW: 1st Visit (take out): For take out I got a regular cheesecake and key lime cheesecake. Both were just under $9. They were both too sweet and too rich. They have a thick layer of cream cheese and have hardly any crust. My favorite part is the crust! Really a disappointment and WAAY overpriced for the quality you get and it's only 1 slice. I'd rather buy a whole pie or cake for just a few bucks more.  2nd Visit (dine in, but got no service): Why do people like this place??? I mean really. There are so many other better places to choose from.  DINING IN: Here's what happened: I sat down, was served bread and was left alone for 20 minutes. WTF? I never had this happen to me at a restaurant before. I even asked another waiter about the problem and still no one came. I didn't want to waste my time anymore so I left.  A Comment on the Menu: While I was waiting for 20 minutes I was looking over the menu and it's ALL American-ized food. Burgers, pasta, and typical breakfast & sides. The reason I'm pointing this out is because if you really want good food, in my experience, I would recommend going to a restaurant that specializes in a particular type of food, meaning if you want a particular type of dish then you should go to an Italian, Southern, or Asian restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory is like a one-stop-shop for all your food needs, which is my theory why people who can't make up their minds eat here. Next time say to yourself, ""Hey, I never had [Indian/Spanish/Peruvian/Vegan] food. Let's go there instead."" 3rd Visit (dine in): - Beet salad = slightly on the sweet side. Great combo of flavors. The 2 red and purple beets gave it a meaty texture. Pecans added crunch, but they should not have been candied pecans. Baby arugula added a smooth, mellow vibe. Cheese was creamy and mellowed out the overly sweet notes. Overall, too sweet. 3/5 - Spicy Cashew Chicken = way too sweet. Tasted like they chose a teriyaki sauce that had the most amount of corn syrup. It wasn't spicy at all. I assume it's because it's cheaper to pay for corn syrup than it is to pay for spices. I couldn't finish it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=140

Cheesecake Factory's menu is so vast, that you could go a few hundred times before trying everything on the menu.   I, unfortunately am a creature of habit. I usually order the same dish until they remove it from the menu.  I only change it up every once in a while. I had the chipotle chicken pasta.  I love bold flavors and this dish definitely packs a punch.  It's also large enough that I can take seconds home for later.  I usually start with the arugula salad. I wish it didn't have as many raisins as it does, but it's still good.  Oddly enough, I don't like cheesecake, so I have never tried it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=180

Same with the food. Some of the food is great, other food is just ok. I like the Tuscan Chicken, most the salads, and the lettuce warps. My aunt and uncle like the chicken marsala. Cheesecake of course is pretty good too. And I love the bread they bring too, especially the brown bread.

This review is just based on this one experience I had last night that was not consistent with the many times I've been there.  Me and my friend sat down and waited a while for our unknown server to take our orders. No one came by and I had to flag down a random server to ask who it was. HE was gracious and offered to take our order and give it to our real server. Then our real server popped up and had the most uncomfortable gaze towards me that makes it seem like he was upset that I flagged someone else down? Not my problem. I give a nervous laugh and begin ordering a wine. He does not ask for an ID even though I begin to reach for my wallet automatically. I ask, don't you need to check my ID? He gives his uncomfortable gaze again and says sure and doesn't really look at it.  Food comes and my bistro shrimp pasta has major lemony taste. It's overpowering. My friend's rice was undercooked.  Throughout our whole meal, the creepy server did not check in with us once. He really made our experience totally uncomfortable.

The negatives: We asked for the soup to be served while we were waiting, but it was delivered about one minute before the main course. Unfortunately the 3 other people at our table received their meals way before mine and were half way through eating before mine arrived.  No apology. The server came back one time to top off our water and didn't bother to ask how things were. Our plates weren't cleared until she decided she needed the table.  The salads appeared to be adequate but the pizza I ordered was disappointing.

cyndi t.,"Alhambra, CA",3,72,8,1.0,12/3/2016,"The manager that runs this place is full of shit. We ask for double servings of spicy chicken on our nachos and as the manager expedite she only gave us a serving of chicken while claiming she gave us two. She said for each serving of chicken she gives 7 oz per serving. Since we ask for more chicken shouldn't she give us 14 oz of chicken yet when we got our nachos we got maybe at most 4 oz. She tried arguing with us on how they measure every amount of meat that they serve. Yet, out of her own good heart she decides to not charge us for the chicken we order and that she promise for another 7 oz of chicken. As we got the extra chicken we ask for she probably only gave us another 3 oz. I'm pretty sure we got less than 14 oz of chicken (more like 8 oz total that after she promise another serving of chicken) she dared charge us another $3. I don't mind paying for what I ordered but how would you feel if someone short change you. Such an unprofessional manager she argue with us and lied to our faces saying that she put double servings yet she didn't. I used to plan for meal servings and I guarantee you that we had at most one serving of chicken (7oz). To be fair if the manager was really sure of the serving size why not bring out the scale and if you are right I will pay for what I eat. If your wrong then you should apologize and not charge for the extra chicken.  We also ordered the egg roll sampler which was great because you get to try four different egg rolls. Avocado was the best but at the same time it hard to mess up with Avocado egg roll. It also hard to mess up with nachos.  If you are planning on cutting short on meat portions maybe you shouldn't tell people about the exact amount of oz you serve for your customer. As a scientist, we do conversion and weigh things on scale everything so I know I didn't get what I paid for. I been to this location before and I ordered the nachos and this was the first time I had such a bad experience. All it takes is just that one bad experience.  The nachos taste delicious but after that encounter with the manager and server they made me feel unpleasant and uncomfortable. I hate it when people straight up lied to my face.  Let's talk about customer service at this location. We had to flag our waitress 3 times to get their attention to get water or any sort of service. On the check they ask for 22% tip yet they didn't really serve us or ever once check back on us. How dare you ask us or demand us for tips when you didn't even do your job. This was at 5pm when there's many empty seats and it not like they were busy.  Another thing was when we ordered a key lime cheesecake to go the cheesecake tasted pretty old and stale. I would never come back to this location unless I have to and I would recommend people going to other locations. Worst service and food compare to other cheesecake locations by far. They deserve exactly 1 star because the food was decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=220

The hostess seemed astonished that she had not thought of that and had the table cleared for us. The waitress seemed absolutely scatter brained and started arguing with my mother about the selections on the menu and possible substitutions.

There was so sort of greasy stain or sauce or something on the outside of my glass. That's just gross. Do they not clean their glasses?? The bread basket came and the wheat bread was as good as I remembered it to be. The food came and my potatoes were super crispy to the point I feel they were more burnt than anything. My husband loves the extra extra crispy so he was happy eating them. My brioche sandwich was just okay. The cheese was not all melty, the bacon was not crispy and it was more fat than anything. The ham flavor was just so so. Bummed about the breakfast sandwich. Will not be ordering that item.  Super noisy today and there were a few screaming kids to add to the meal.

I'd prefer more spice, but maybe not on a first date, right.  Filet Mignon Well, if you're going to tell a guy you mean business, why not get the most tender steak on the menu. She did. It's a decent meat offering and comes with some fairly standard French Fries and Onion Strings.

I agree that not everyone should be allowed to just order buffalo wings without having earned that right by proving their skill at nostalgic games from far better days. The only complaint that I had was that it seemed a bit counter intuitive to have to put on your skates before being allowed into the elevator which took you to the second level rink but once I got up there and saw just how awesome the light show and fog machines were, it made it all worth the falls and minor bruises. The fact that you could either exit the venue through the (well designed and aesthetically pleasing) front door or water slide located on the balcony just goes to show you how far ahead this place is to other similar establishments. Fortunately, I always pack an extra pair of trunks when heading to the Factory. Insider tip, if you want to be cool then you must know that nobody calls it by its full name.

She didn't notice that my husband had left a piece of shell in one of the corners and the same piece was there when she brought it back. Very disappointing. My husband ordered a Tuscan chicken that was supposed to be less then 590 calories and the chicken was swimming in olive oil. He had the same dish before and it definitely didn't appear to be that way. My son ordered chicken Marsala and he found a carrot together with the mushrooms. Don't know how it ended up there.

I believe, if you are in a place like this, you have to be very, very picky. It is not bad. But it is not what it portrays to be. Just think of it as a glorified fast food place. You are there for convenience, not for top-notch dining experience. These are not homemade cheesecakes so don't expect anything gourmet or grand. These are mass-produced desserts so I recommend going for the safe picks instead of going crazy with the selection and then get disappointed later. Because they'll taste like SUGAR. None of the real thing. The one cheesecake that stood out though was Lemoncello. Then their pumpkin pecan cheesecake was a safe bet. I wouldn't recommend their lunch or other food selection either.

Winnie J.,"Los Angeles, CA",212,23,25,2.0,1/13/2016,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factory locations. I am from Indiana and we have one there I've been to one in Chicago and now Pasadena. I came here with a client from work and my friends ordered a harvest salad that comes with some type of special dressing they kept telling her that it wasn't a special dressing. It was an awkward moment between the manager & her. Typically the customer is always right but not here. So tonight my daughter turned 11months and we decided to come here now granted it was 9pm and they close at 11pm. I typically order the Louisiana chicken pasta (never lets me down) but i tried something new the zesty lemon chicken which comes with mashed potatoes and carrots. My plate comes and it LOOKS delicious the chicken www great moist and tender the mashed potatoes were dry. Almost as if it is the last bath for the night and they aren't making any fresh. I send them back and ask for green beans. The green beans come out and they are burnt there is a puddle of brown oil at the bottom of the plate. There was literally like charcoal flakes on the plate. So the waiter who I must say was amazing went to get the manager. She came over and asked what I was having and I told her my issues with the dry cold mashed potatoes and now the burnt ass oily green beans. She persisted to tell me ""that's how we cook our green beans""  so you mean to tell me you purposely browned this oil and made sure they were burnt with no flavor other than hydrogenated oil. That was done on PURPOSE. B#%^ please quit diffusing responsibility and own up to the fact that this is wrong. I subconsciously felt that she thought because we were black we wanted our mean competed but that is my own personal feeling. So I asked her to taste them she looked at me like I was asking her to drink polyjuice potion. So you will serve these green beans but won't eat them  *mental note made* so I asked her ""are your green beans cooked in oil or butter"" my thought process was if the skillet was too hot the butter would brown hence for the murky substance at the bottom of the plate. Logically speaking. She leaves the table and returns and says ""Oil"" so now I'm like that's some dirty dark oil to be cooking my green beans in. She apologizes ""for me expecting something different"" which is a slap in the face offers us a dessert which I turn down and dismissed her. Her attitude was that of woman who has been beat up by life and I'm just another problem. She seemed bothered that I was bothered by my food presentation. Lady this is your JOB to manage this restaurant fix complaints. So our waiter is comes back and ask if we are getting a free dessert I said now he said ""why not"" lol so we got a strawberry cheesecake.

For dessert we had the raspberry cheesecake and it had a chocolate crust that complimented the raspberry in the cheesecake. Jay thought it was a bit too sweet, but it was ok. Mon thought it was delicious!  Second visit...again they brought us some bread and butter for starters and it was really good, as always. Jay ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with bowtie pasta. She didn't like the pasta but the chicken was thin buttery and had a crispy crust, Yummy! Mon ordered the Chicken Madeira and loved it!

He ran to the kitchen, then came back explaining he's actually in training, and he's sorry our order did not go thru in the kitchen. WHAT?! 45 mins and this was just realized now?!

The lighting at this chain of restaurants is always very low but I took out my iphone and used the flashlight lolol I ended up trying something new while my husband got what he usually gets, The Bang Bang Shrimp, which according to him is always delicious. I ordered the Chicken Katsu which was very good! I would go back there just to have it again. Essentially it is a breaded chicken breast fillet but the accompanying spicy miso sauce gives it just the right flavor.

It came out to be $20 for a salad! Ridiculous! The tuna was not even fresh, and was a little tough, the three slices of tomato was huge and almost same portion as the green mix (which was tossed to seem like a lot, but it wasn't, I ordered a salad, not a tomato and tuna dish with side salad.

A very sad Caesar indeed! Since the very reason I crave the Factory is for their Caesar, it will take me a while to get that craving given my last distasteful experience.  As for my daughter's macaroni and cheese, it was scorching hot and the noodles were so dry as if it were microwaved full blast right before serving it to her. If their mac&cheese is in fact microwaved, I would have never known it before. It's as if the mac&cheese's dirty little secret were just revealed to me after years of believing it was made fresh daily and not recycled from yesterday's trash.

First we were denied the ability to purchase alcoholic beverages simply because of the origin of  our ID's all 3 of us being from Guatemala. This is the first time we have ever been denied the right to consume alcohol because of the origin of our ID's we are all over the age of 21 and I have had no issue before anywhere proving my age with my ID from  my country Guatemala. After the waiter had denied our ID's to validate our age  we asked for a Manager which also rudely confirmed the same and that it's the law that they don't accept ID's from the country of Guatemala to confirm legal age to drink. Even after the manager pointed out in a very rude way simply cause we were ""Guatemalns"" we still were planing on having dinner. After he just left and just left us there for 20 mins with no follow up no waiter to come and assist us so we just took of and left. I ask to speak to him again before we left, at no time we had an apology from him, and still was really rude. I don't think someone before made us felt that bad and that ""excluded"" just cause of the fact of our origins...

It's served on a bed of white rice with special cream sauce and miso reduction and some snow peas. The biggest complaint I have is around the wait. We waited almost 20 minutes for the food.

Had a tossed Cobb, and club sandwiches for my lunch mates. Everything was great, fresh, large.

All of our food came out quickly and hot.  We ordered the warm asparagus, the grilled artichoke, sliders, and the pear and blue cheese flatbread. All were amazing.  Not only that but she was on top of refilling our drinks and making sure we were okay. Will definitely be coming back and hopefully get Katie again.

Laura T.,"Alhambra, CA",655,338,1014,4.0,5/29/2011,"I have so many wonderful memories here. Staff here is friendly, nice, always willing to help. Unlike the other locations I went to, that offered me nothing but crappy customer service served with a side of bad attitude! (Arcadia - Santa Anita Mall and Brea just to name the TWO!) Appetizer: If you love, avocados as much as I do, then you will love Avocado Eggrolls. Just chunks of avocados in every bite.  Suggestion, if you get the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, don't get the small sampler potion, its not enough to go around. Always get the full potion.  Entree: When I am here, I would always get the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Ooooh, so yummy, it is a must try! Always get the full/dinner potion, strongly suggested. Why you ask? Well, the leftovers taste just as good. So, it doesn't hurt to have some the day after or as a midnight snack, whatever works. Drink:  Strawberry Lemonade is totally delicious and refreshing, served in a cold cup garnished with a sugar rim. Makes one all fancy for having one. And if you really LOVE it, you can take your leftovers to go too! They give you a to go cup and refill it as well. Such nice generous people. Desert:  I know since its the Cheesecake Factory, I must at least rate a cheesecake. Well, I come to realize that, since I ate here so MANY times, I never really ordered a cheesecake before. Until sometime last year, when I was craving for some red velvet cupcakes. I ended up trying their Red Velvet Cheesecake. O.M.G! Yumlicious!  Taste just like a red velvet cupcake with a hint of cheesecake. Amazing right?! Atmosphere and decor inside the restaurant is the same in all location. But like I said before, better staff better services.  Parking, since its in Pasadena, parking isn't always free. The parking lot off Green St and the De Lacy both offer 90 minute free parking. But this location, normally has a 15 to 30 minute plus wait time. They don't offer parking validation, and you are not able to make a reservation before hand. God, leaving a review right now is making me hungry. Maybe I should come here for dinner later. Ha ha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=320
Ted B.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,101,58,2.0,4/21/2014,"Maybe I'm spoiled by the Cheesecake Factory at The Americana in Glendale, which is better than this one in every way! I came here for Sunday brunch. Pros: We got seated fairly quickly, in less time than they estimated for us. The service was quick, and our waitress was generally very good and friendly and attentive. It was my wife's Birthday and they put the piece of cake that she ordered on a nice decorated plate with her name written on it in chocolate, and they sang Happy Birthday. It was very well done, and that really made her day! My wife liked her whole meal. I had the crab hash, which was very good. The cons: Prices just seem to be going up and up and up at this place. I ordered a small $7 side salad (that should be the price of a large salad!) to have before my meal. What they brought to my table was this small, I mean puny little salad with wilted greens, and the entire salad could fit in the palm of my hand! I'm not kidding, for 7 bucks!  The breakfast potatoes that came with my hash were dreadful! They looked like the cheapest deep fried potatoes that you could buy in the frozen section of a grocery store. They were basically little grease sponges! They were so greasy that they were translucent because of all the grease! And when you pressed on one, all the oil would ooze out! And those were the ""good"" pieces of potato! The rest were greasy little hard crunchy bottom-of -the -barrel crumbs that looked like they scraped off the grill just to make it look like they were giving you more pieces, but they were not even edible! And about half the potatoes were like that! I asked the server that brought me the potatoes if that was how the potatoes normally are, or if there was something wrong with my particular serving, and he laughed and said yep, that's how they normally are! The bagel I had was not fresh at all! It tasted like it was old and had been sitting around a while, borderlined stale. Then when were were paying our check, we paid for part of it with a gift card. We gave the waitress the card, and she comes back saying the card  was no good and brought  us a bill for the rest of the meal. And said we could call the company and find out why it didn't work , etc., etc. I knew the gift card was good so I told here to please try it again. So she goes back and tries it again and the card worked this time because she  punched in the numbers by hand. Why couldn't she have tried that the first time it didn't work, instead of coming back to the table and embarrassing us saying it wouldn't go through and handing us another bill?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=320

I forgot to get her name. In case this counts, we were there around 11pm on Friday 6-12-15 Memo table for 2. I hesitated to try this place for so long because all I heard were stories of high prices. We ate for under $15 each meal. We ordered one drink called the Whisky Smash...BOMB! Perfect blend of liquor and flavor! But that little cup was $11. Say la veee (how ever you spell it, you know what I mean!). It was nice and my husband keeps talking about going back. WOW! I love this place! I would have only removed half a star if it were possible. A large family walked in behind us and literally shoved us aside as they rushed to the counter to check in.

Oh well, it happens. I mean you can go to a mall and go to a cheesecake so why come here and do so?  Even worse, I was actually taken on a first date here. Yep, it's nice to let people choose cause then they're guaranteed to enjoy the food.... But when the food is likely to have been mass produced in those creepy giant tubs of stuff you see in cafeterias (but they do it behind closed doors here so it's more ok?) and shipped in for consumption, ya gotta wonder what there is to like. Ironically, my only other cheesecake review mentions the ridiculousness of doing so. Ohhh karma. Or, is it worse that he prob hasn't heard of yelp?

Price: A little expensive (one piece of cheesecake is about $8).  The bill for 3 was almost $100 before tip.   Service: Excellent.  They are very friendly, attentive, and they have great break coverage. Wait time: Not too bad.  Saturday night at 6pm waited only 10 min to be sat.   Parking: HORRIBLE!!!  Valet is $7 (with validation, $10 without) and worth it considering the parking lots are $6.  I drove to one lot and it was full and to get to the next lot I had to wait forever at the stop lights and figure out the one way streets...nightmare...I should have valeted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=320

I ordered the Americana Cheeseburger it was DELICIOUS! Instead of fries I ordered a side salad. Everything was really good. My bill was about $15 not too shabby for restaurant food.

Andrea L.,"Boston, MA",99,265,123,4.0,11/23/2012,"Honestly, I didn't want to come here for lunch. My friends and I decided on a shopping day in Old Town Pasadena and we were starving, but I really wanted to try something that wasn't as ""chain-y"" as TCF. Sure, there were lots of chain restaurants in the area, but are so many TCF's around the area, so I was hoping for something unique. But they didn't want to walk anymore, and one person who suggested to come here was soon followed by murmurs of agreement, so I had to come in. Looking at the menu, I saw that almost 80% of the items that I wanted to eat could be homemade at home without too much effort. Salads, pastas, even dishes like Shepard's pie and meatloaf were things that I could make, so I really just didn't want to spend money on it, being the cheapo that I was. But I was hungry and didn't care, so I picked something that sounded simple yet delicious: the cashew chicken salad. It was a hot day and I wanted something light yet filling, so I was very satisfied when I got my food. It was the $10 lunch portion, which I expected to be tiny, since it was a ""smaller portion"" of the regular dish. I loved the crispy tortilla chips, crunchy cashews, and the zesty but light peanut vinaigrette over the tender chicken and mixed greens. It turned out to be a great lunch. One thing I really wished though was better service. It wasn't terrible, but I could tell some of the waiters/waitresses were tired of their job or just in a cranky mood. We are poor college kids, so you would expect us to gobble up the complimentary bread and butter and then ask for some more just a couple minutes later, but the lady just looked bored and annoyed at our request.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=320

Plus they have been the most consistent with food and drinks. Point and case. I've order the vegan salad and the Georgia peach from all locations. At the Americana I was only provided one type of dressing for my salad, the second time.I met friends there I was given 2. At Westfield Arcadia I asked how many dressings am I getting with this salad and the waitress told me 3.  But Pasadena they have always consistently given me 2. Not a huge deal except when I got three ot sure tasted like i got double dressing of the same kind. On to my drink. I have to say I do love Grey Goose mainly because I don't get hangovers from drinking it. I'm a lightweight to begin with so one good drink is all I need to be feeling no pain. Well you would hope that when you ask for Grey Goose you would get it. Didn't happen for sure at the Americana but was told it was but my bill didn't reflect it.... worse yet I had a hangover the next day. Besides being consistent with the above mentioned this location has been pretty consistent with other food items like their bang bang shrimp and chicken, providing a bread basket, their chicken and biscuits, stuffed mushrooms, crab cakes, Madera chicken and of course their desserts.

Not a very successful menu item, and please, Juan, when your customer orders something (like onions on the side) and you cannot do it, please let them know BEFORE you present them with the dish- It could be that they have an allergy !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=360

When we got the manager over a second time and told her all that had gone wrong, all she could say was basically ""we're really busy right now"" and ""what would you like me to do"".  When we said they should comp us our meals given the horrible service and food, she had the audacity to say she couldn't do that because she hadn't seen two of the meals.  So they made us pay for two of our four meals despite them all being terrible. We ended up at El Pollo Loco to actually get some decent food afterwards.  Absolutely HORRIBLE experience at a restaurant brand that I have usually liked in the past.  I will never go back to the Pasadena Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=360

Is the food really that good? And what's up with the menu? So many freakin' choices. It takes me forever to decide what I want because it's like 23 pages.  OK enough with my rambling. We came here for a late happy hour after the book signing at Vroman's and discovering El Portal (our original plans) was closed early. Bummer. The appetizers we got were so-so. The taquitos were actually OK but the avocado eggrolls were cold; the drinks however were pretty good so at the end of the night I was just happy to spend time with friends vs the subpar food. Oh well. At least there was a parking structure nearby that made things a bit convenient.  And what's up with seating families with kids at the bar area?

Yes, they have the farfalle pasta, jambalaya, pizza, sandwiches, tacos, etc, etc.... but damn why was I so late to try the Chicken Bellagio? Well anyways, you have two slabs of breaded chicken breast topped with proscuitto and arugula served with basil pasta. Huge portions, enough for two, and my this is an excellent dish. I'm impressed Cheesecake! Usually Cheesecake Factory is crowded, the lines out the door. I found an easier way. Just go to the self-seating bar area. You still get the same dine-in experience.

Cheryl V.,"Los Angeles, CA",158,192,,3.0,4/5/2013,"If you go to a Cheesecake Factory, there is a certain standard level you expect the restaurant to meet in terms of decor, food, and service.  I would have to applaud this particular CF location because they get just about everything right, and there's nothing different about my latest experience here than any of my other visits to the many CF locations I've been to, both in SoCal and elsewhere. This place is great when you're just not very picky and are hungry and maybe have some friends or family with you.  Their extensive menu with satiate any appetite (as long as it's a big one), and they have some pretty decor inside.  The waiters all wear white and long aprons -- something out of a culinary school, it would seem like.  The food is pretty much the same if you order the same few plates every time (like I do) and can compare between locations. One thing that did irk me a bit is that at dinner last night, I had ordered a split bubbly with two glasses -- my husband and I are closing escrow on a house and wanted to celebrate -- and after ten minutes, our waitress came by to inform us that they pulled the bottles out of storage and that they ""can put it over ice for us, or did I want it at room temperature?""  Room temperature?  Really?  Has anyone ever requested sparkling at room temp?  A very, very odd inquiry.  I ended up cancelling the bubbly (even if over ice, it would take a little bit longer, and we were both dead tired by that point) and ordering a glass of white wine instead. When we had finished dinner and needed our check, it was a bit difficult to flag our waiter down.  And, when the check was brought to us, the bubbly was still left on the bill, so we had to ask to have it removed. All in all, an okay experience, one that I would expect from a CF.  But last night was a bit frustrating, which shouldn't happen on a night we wanted to celebrate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=380

As we were waiting , Josh from the bar area came to us and asked us if we would like to avoid the wait and just sit at the bar and have dinner there, I looked at my gf and she nodded ""yes"". He escorted us to the bar, and Katie was there to welcome us with a big smile and set up our area very cute with a table cloth and glasses. We ordered dinner and drinks and they both kept checking on us as a team. We had the best time! It was only my second time there so Josh asked me what I like, I said spicy food! Lol (I'm Mexican) he recommended the Jamaican black pepper spicy shrimp and rice, it also came with mango salad and plantains. They made our date fun. Josh and Katie make such a great team.

If you want to go for a romantic dinner i suggest another one because this one is more for everyone that is tired of walking blocks and blocks and shopping around. it gets packed but they are very fast in attending. when i walked in for my birthday i thought they were at least going to take 30 min because the waiting area was super packed. when i asked how long was the wait they said 3 min. i was a little critical about it, but in like 2 min they told us our table was ready. i was surprised. the food was great and the service as well. it was just really really packed. once we were seated they did take a while to take our order but we didn't mind since we didn't know what we wanted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=400

We had the manager come out 2 times to fix these issues. Then, our friend bit into a meatball... Completely raw on the inside! Again, the manager was brought out. When the bill came we expected to have all the food taken off since it was such a horrible experience for all 4 of us, but they refused to take the burned pizza off because the manager said ""it's supposed to be like that."" We agreed to pay for the drinks but were adamant about not paying for any of the horrible food...

E G.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,48,17,2.0,11/20/2015,"Just when I had a good streak.... ok I have good reasons for this particular one. Just to be clear, I actually like cheesecake factory. For a chain restaurant it's pretty good. Food, drinks, service are decent and I do have a special place in my heart for this chain. I would be giving the cheesecake factories I've been to at least 4 stars.... just not this location. Here's why.  Food. The taste of everything overall wasn't as good as the others. Example, I ordered the ribeye with fries, the steak itself was cooked to my liking, so bonus points. But it was too salty, and I do have a salty pallet and don't mind salty things. But in this case it was too salty, and you know it is when a guy who likes salty things says so. When I got the fries, I actually in my mind, and verbally, said ""noooooo."" Like Luke Skywalker finding out Vader is his father nooo. Because the fries changed. Not sure if it's this location, or they changed everywhere, but the fries are no longer skinny and crispy. They are the fat fries that everyone serves. Not that I have anything against fat fries, they are still good, but the skinny fries are what made them unique because not many places have them. It sounds like a personal gripe, but I wouldn't have mind if they tasted good.... not really. They tasted they've been sitting under the heat lamp for a while.  They gave me a couple onion rings with it, which was nice, but most of it was batter. How much, like a legit inch of it. If you like that kind of thing, hey go it, but i like tasting some of my onion in my onion rings. If there is too much batter it's not balanced and the flavor is too overpowering. Also one other minor gripe on food, depending if you want to view this as one or not, the the ketchup taste like one of those knock off want to be ketsup. You know when Mr. Burns was at the grocery store and couldn't pick between the two bottles... yeah it was like that. It could be home made, idk, but if it is.... it needs work. With that being said, I would have given this a 3 star if it weren't for 1 other factor.... the service. I read other reviews and yes service here sucks. The waiters and waitresses were nice don't get me wrong, but they sucked on everything else. They checked up on us once after our food came out, and only because we looked depressed and upset. Because of that we didn't get refills on drinks, extra sauces we wanted, extra plates, etc. I think the manager checked up on us also, but also only because we had our heads down and looked disapointed. I was gonna say because we came during closing time, so I would understand if they wanted to pack up or they were just tired. But after seeing what other people said.... yeah it's not just me.  Again, I actually like this chain, but this one really needs work. I'm willing to give it another shot in the future, just be aware this wouldn't be my first pick as of now. With being in downtown pasadena surrounded by other good places, it's really hard to pick this place if i know i can get better on food and service. 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=400

Once we ordered the food came out shortly there after! I ordered the chicken and biscuits with mashed potatoes and broccoli and I must say this was quite good! The biscuit was warm and soft on the inside and slightly crunchy in the outside. The potatoes were flavorful and the broccoli was perfectly steamed.

It's usually pretty packed during its busy hours on Friday nights and on weekends, but there's practically no wait on a weekday. Between the three girls of our family, we ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza, a Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta and a slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake. I'm not a pizza person, but I thought the pizza was very good. The crust was sweet and the taste was flavorful. It was great. The pasta, however, was just mediocre. I felt like it was a bit overpriced for just diced tomatoes, some pasta and five jumbo shrimp. And the red velvet cheesecake never fails. I've ordered this every time and sometimes just for to-go! It is a must, but who am I to say anything since it's also the only one I've tried. I'm extremely content with the cheesecake, although it puzzles me that the size of it varies depending on what day you go? (I can't exactly figure it out).  Take advantage of the ""Skinnylicious"" menu, because some of that stuff is good and pretty healthy. It will lessen your guilt when you indulge in your cheesecake. I recommend the Turkey & Avocado Sandwich. The complimentary bread is really good, but especially the brown one. I always ask for seconds.

Abcde A.,"Chino, CA",0,75,5,3.0,5/18/2016,Went here for lunch today with 6 other coworkers. Server was a little over confident not using a pad to take down our orders which seemed pretty amazing IF they had all been right but three of them weren't. Then I asked for more bread and was told they were OUT of bread which was odd for a middle of the week noon time lunch. After receiving 4 correct meals we noticed the couple at the table next to us receive a basket of bread but we were told they were out? I asked the server who brought out their basket could he bring us bread and he replied yes but never returned. Upon paying for our check our server asked was their anything else he could get for us and I jokingly replied yah some bread but you don't have anymore. He replied I'll see what I can do and returned with warm TO GO bread for us. Then why tell us that lie in the first place when we saw other guests being given bread?  This may be minor to some but it's the honestly and integrity being displayed by workers to guests that bring return customers. Myself and two other coworkers would have liked bread with our meals but weren't given that true option.

Ty D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",572,559,141,4.0,7/5/2010,"I must admit that I'm not a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  The menu is just insanely way too much variety for me and the portions are way too humongous for me.  And I must admit, cheesecake is probably my least favorite dessert along with flan. This past Friday I decided to take my Mom to lunch and the Norton Simon museum and since The Cheesecake Factory was on the way to the museum on Colorado, I decided to bring Mom here for lunch. We were seated by our friendly hostess right away since we were early enough to avoid the lunch hour rush.  Our waiter was also very friendly explaining the specials of the day and bringing to the table freshly baked, sliced and warm squaw and sourdough loaves. Mom decided on a half sandwich (which she opted for the turkey), soup (which was clam chowder which was the d'jour for the day) and salad, and I ordered a lunch portion of the cabo (?) salad. Service was fast and very friendly.    Mom wasn't a big clam chowder fan but thought her soup was good.  Her salad was just way too big for her to even make a dint out of it.  And she ate about half of her half turkey sandwich.  She thought the french baguette roll that her sandwich was on was a bit tough for her to chew...although that maybe due to the age factor (to be polite to Mom). My salad was good and also huge.  I'm glad I got the lunch size portion.  My salad had corn, black beans, romaine lettuce, red onions, diced chicken breast, tomato slices tossed in a chipotle dressing and topped with corn tortilla strips.  It was good, although for my taste I thought they over did it with the dressing. Our service was very attentive and friendly.  Our waiter made sure that our lemonade and Arnold Palmer's were filled throughout our lunch.  We were way too stuffed for dessert.  Which is always the case when coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=420

Chain restaurants generally don't specialize to begin with, and OTP has always been rather crowded anyway. However, the gripe I have is with the food itself. The portions are way too big and this place leaves me nauseated for some reason. At first I thought it was just me after the first time in Arcadia, but nope, happened after my visits here too.

When they are accepting applications for servers, which is only a couple times a year, I've been told they receive hundreds of applications and only choose a select bunch to become servers.  I think their service is largely credited to that process. Food Being a regular, I cycle through my favorite dishes and they are consistently good and served freshly made and piping hot. Recommendations: Snack Plate: Fried Zucchini   Soup: Wednesday's Baked Potato Soup (order extra hot) Appetizer: Fried Mac & Cheese Mains: The Pecan Crusted Cat Fish (this is an off the menu special) Chicken Bellagio (tender breaded chicken filet over pesto marinated spaghetti ) Pasta Da Vinci (their most popular pasta, sweet sauce, tender chicken) Herb crusted Salmon - lunch portion is very generous...order it with broccoli instead of asparagus  Skinnylicious Menu: Taco's plate (chicken) fantastic, light, healthy Cheesecake: Red Velvet, Pumpkin (seasonal), key lime The Bad This place doesn't take reservations and gets so busy its frustrating.  Even on weekdays, you need to arrive around 1145 for lunch service, otherwise you'll be stuck waiting 20+ minutes.  There are special deals maybe once a year here, so you'll always be stuck with their semi-high prices.   Overall Great spot for date night or the family or a business meal as long as you come early.  Good quality, consistent food.  Impeccable service.  A+",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=460

I wasn't thrilled with the small piece of chicken that came on top of my pasta, not cut into smaller pieces at all.. just one big chunk.  The chicken had the bone in it, and lots of skin.  I figured it would be a boneless skinless chicken breast.  Surprised that you pay $3 to add it to your pasta, and that's what you get.  Didn't fit with the quality of the other ingredients. I'm very picky, and my order was fairly complicated.. I told the waiter he would get it wrong if he didn't write it down.. and sure enough, it came wrong.  It was entertaining though.  He swore he entered it correctly and they just made it wrong.  It literally took them about one minute to have it corrected though, I didn't mind.

When it comes to Cajun, and of all places; a chain like Cheesecake would probably be the last place you'll think of. The trinity of flavors that was known for Cajun Jambalaya are all here, with the dish being very well seasoned and boldly flavored. While its authenticity might not be comparable to the great folks down in the great Bayou of Louisiana but they seemed to have done an excellent job fusing it with linguine pasta instead of rice (which I've substituted a few times depending on my mood). This is the ONLY thing I crave from their menu!  The place (caution): I lost count of the number of times I've eaten here, and every visit has always been great. With that said, the food and service was also excellent...BUT...the water supply from this old building is contaminated due to old rusted pipes! The last time I ate here, I ordered a Jack & Coke and gotten very sick after a few hours with bladder infection. It got worst the next day so I had to see a doctor.

Michael Y.,"Pasadena, CA",20,204,160,2.0,7/24/2013,"This was one of the worst service experiences I've had this year. I've been to many other cheesecake locations and Pasadena is by far the worst location/experience ever (on Wednesday July 24).   There was no wait when we arrived tonight, which I thought was strange but nice.  It's the first time I've not waited.. but now I know why...management, staffing and service is pretty bad. First, our physical menu was dirty (eg, sauce spilled over, dirtied our hands). And then we waited 20 minutes just to order.  We kept looking out for our waiter and he disappeared and re-appeared just to serve other tables, I think perhaps there was a lack of staff or poor coordination so it may not have been his fault.  The tables here are darker, which made it hard to read the menu, other Cheesecake locations have candles and this is never a problem. Now, the waiter had misunderstood our order even though we repeated it twice to clarify, and when the dish came out, one of our group informed him that the dish was incorrect, he blamed us, claiming that we told him wrong. That is a big no-no for any restaurant. The rest of our party heard it correctly so for this one waiter to claim that WE were wrong when it was HIM, this was totally inappropriate to shift blame to the customer. Also, water should be filled without our having to ask, but we needed to ask a staff after 1 hour of no water-filling and that was annoying. Perhaps this again was a staffing issue.  Poor resource management and/or poor operational systems. For the food, all of our appetizers and entrees including the avocado, corn dogs, pizza, all good.  Didn't have much problem, though it just didn't taste as good as we've had at other locations. Poor service really ruins the whole eating experience.  I have been to other cheesecake factory locations at least 30 times, and always trusted I would be treated well, but this is the first time when I now question whether all Cheesecakes are the same.  This one obviously was below average, but I would probably be willing to give it one more chance, if I had no other choice.  Since I think it may have been a one-off terrible night, I will be a bit more general in this review, but next time I'll be more detailed and specific with manager & staff names.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=500

I know it was a busy night, but once we received our food, we were forgotten about. I wanted a refill too! Diane's Thai lettuce wraps were delicious. My kobe burger however, was pretty lame. It didn't even taste like ""Kobe"". It just tasted like a regular burger, yet surprisingly a step below fast food flavor. I felt I overpaid for that burger, I only ate half then I was done with it. It wasn't appealing what-so-ever.  Afterwards, we finished things off w/ a tiramasu cheesecake! It was f*cking fantastic! I wish I would have just ordered the Cheesecake instead of my my meal :-( .

They try to placate people with bread, when they should focus on getting some drinks and food orders to the customers. It doesn't appear to be from lack of staff, as there is a ton all over the place. This leads me to think one of two things, either the staff are incompetent, or it is poorly directed by management. I was here for dessert and coffee on a Tuesday night, and they still can't handle the load. Try coming here on a Friday or Saturday, and that will be impossible. Our server was Kourtney.

Andrea A.,"Altadena, CA",0,19,,1.0,2/9/2015,"This is not a review on the food, but rather the service and overall management of this location.  I was really surprised and disappointed that the hostess let my mother and I walk out of the restaurant after we refused to wait 20 minutes for a booth when multiple booths were open. We went to Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner at about 6:00 and we got right in and were shown to a table with one bench seat and one chair. My mother is 67 with a bad back and while I am half her age, I had also recently injured my back and need more support than a cane backed chair. Before accepting the table, we asked if we could instead have one of the two-top mini booths 10 feet away. 2 of the 3 mini booths were open. The hostess (who seemed like she was in training) informed us that the waitstaff for that area wasn't in yet and it would likely be a 20 minute wait, but that we could go back up to the hostess desk and check. So we went back up front (where I also saw more booths open) and we were told that it would be a 20 minute wait for a booth. Since that was absolutely ridiculous, we walked out.   I was shocked and annoyed and the next time someone suggests eating at Cheesecake Factory, I will suggest elsewhere. But I am happy to know that Cheesecake Factory is doing so well that they are perfectly fine allowing two paying customers to walk out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=520
Jason A.,"Cerritos, CA",1079,700,1631,5.0,10/20/2008,"For a Cheesecake Factory, this is probably as good as it gets. A couple stories and on a busy intersection in Old Town Pasadena. This particular location is so popular that I and my friends had to wait 2 hours to be seated. So what's a group of friends to do when you have two hours to burn? Drink at the nearest bar, of course! So naturally, we wandered across the street for a little bit and found a sports bar showing the NBA All-Star game slam dunk contest. We chilled on some beers and watched a little bit of the contest before summoning up the wherewithal to go back and check to see if ""Jason"" had been called. Not yet. So we hung out outside and stood on the intersection and got in hundreds of people's way. It's an incredible way to people-watch. A cold night usually makes people dress up more, and seeing some of the ladies display their cold-time clothes can be impressive. Remember, we don't have winters in Los Angeles. Once we actually did get called, I remember having a nice window view of the same intersection we were standing on earlier. It was rather impressive at night, seeing the people populate that area and staring at you eat. I got the steak diane, another trusted and true choice and some more beers. I started hitting on some tannish looking girls sitting at the table next to us after throwing back a few. Never talk about the other person's exotic race, unless they bring it up. Otherwise, you just might look like a racist. I think we left there pretty buzzed not only from what we drank at restaurant, but from also the sports bar from earlier.

One of their best dishes is their herb crusted filet of salmon.  I also love the brown bread -- you can skip the white bread.  Food might improve if they weren't trying to cater to so many tastes.

I mean if I didn't like it the first time around, perhaps if I took it home with me and looked at it and thought about it I might enjoy it more in a few hours? my quest to find the perfect cheeseburger was waylaid by a stop at the Cheesecake.

Gregory M.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,150,1,2.0,8/17/2010,"A decidedly average restaurant with consistent problems with service. I've eaten at this particular Cheesecake Factory three or four times. And there hasn't been a single time when something didn't go wrong. The time before last I was given a ketchup bottle that exploded when I opened it, covering my hands and shirt with fermented ketchup. Now, in all fairness, they are very apologetic when something is awry and they try to fix it.  But it would be nice if it didn't happen so often. At my most recent visit at around 3:30 on a weekday, I was seated relatively quickly. My waiter took my drink order and, five minutes later, my appetizer and entree order. I then proceeded to wait a good thirty minutes for my appetizer (white bean hummus). When it finally came, it was a bit disappointing...chunky and rather bland. I actually added a good amount of table salt to give it a little bit of flavor. Meh. The burger I ordered came about 20 minutes later. It was the Kobe Beef Burger with Onions and Mushrooms. I ordered it Medium Rare, like I pretty much always do. When it finally came, it was cooked well-done. When the waiter came to check on me, he asked if everything was the way I wanted it and I mentioned the burger being overcooked. He took my plate and and said he would be back soon.  In the meantime, I picked at the really bland salad and refrigerated tomato (note: refrigerating tomatoes is a sin) for a few minutes before a manager came by to apologize. It was certainly a good move, but I was already losing hope of having a decent dining experience. The burger finally came back, in the medium to medium rare range. I ate about 3/4 of the burger before getting my check and heading out. While it was actually cooked properly, it was surprisingly bland and came, like the salad, with a gross, mealy slice of tomato.  For a simple lunch, I ended up being in the restaurant for a good hour and a half.  While there was no exploding ketchup this time and the staff tried to ameliorate the situtation, I really have no interest in returning for more punishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=560

Louie F.,"Santa Barbara, CA",182,291,80,4.0,7/1/2010,"I must say, the worst part about eating at the Cheesecake Factory (any location), is figuring out what to order. The menu is huge and the advertisements abundant. I'm not sure if I should order the Navajo sandwich or a diamond watch! In any event, I've never had a bad meal here. The dinner bread they serve is delicious and usually steaming hot when it arrives to your table. The avocado egg rolls are by far the standard I compare all other restaurants too.  I've had many entrees from the menu, but the the Chicken & Biscuits has to be my favorite by far. The chicken is tender and moist while the biscuits are fluffy. However, the magic really happens when they dump gravy over the entire dish! Now we're talkin!  Now to the dessert...the item that gives this restaurant its name. The cheesecake here is so creamy and rich that you find yourself planning the rest of your meal around having room for dessert. Although most of the time, my eyes are bigger than my stomach and I end up taking the cheesecake to go -- makes an excellent breakfast too FYI.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=580

We arrived around 3:30pm on a wednesday and were seated immediately by their hostess that was super friendly and chose a seat nearby the window. only down side is that if you sit near the windows people who walk around look at you and see what you're eating!! Our waiter was Gustavo and service couldnt have been better. he introduced us to the menu cause obviously i was completely lost to the million things they had on their menu. my friend and i were only there for dessert so he told us that the red velvet cheesecake is the most popular so i decided to get that and my friend got the chocolate fudge cheesecake and it was REALLY good. i also rate service on how well they notice you and by that i mean beverage refills. if they notice that you're low on your drink and they refill it doesnt that mean whenever you need something they'll be right there? this guy refilled my water when i drank it barely 3/4s of the way!!! great service will return soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=580

Lisa H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",344,16,6,2.0,5/22/2015,"We dined in here last night for my sisters' birthday, her choice. We usually go to Sabor in Valencia but she wanted to change it up. We got sat at a table in the main dining room right under the air conditioning vent. I asked if we could move to the table a few feet away that wasn't directly under the vent. Our server made a comment how he was so hot and that this was the best he could do. Put off and clearly unsettled, he finally gave in and ""let us"" move showing it bothered him that we would no longer be in his section. I might add, that if u want to consider being a ""fine dining"" restaurant, its the little things that make your experience exceptional. At this point, we are all bothered. The next server came, a girl, who seemed nice but really cared about her job. She cared more about carding me (26) my mom (55) and dad (49) than being down to earth and personable. I was very put off by this, I find it disrespectful to ask the clearly older adults for their ID's. She even craned her neck around to make sure I was who my ID said I was even though I pulled my card right out of my ID slip of my wallet. Now I get it, I've worked at yard house and understand where you are getting at with service, but its clearly obvious you are force feeding us the same detailed description of an appetizer, entree and dessert. I would rather have someone wait on us that is going to have somewhat of a pulse, a personality. Dinner was good, I got the chicken madiera (which is pronounced ma-dare-ah) my server corrected me.... Anyways, the cheesecake factory gets two stars because the servers are so drilled to be perfect that they forgot what true service is. The little things, the personable behavior, the light connections made with the guest. They fall short because they care so much about ""guest perception"" that they lose the fundamentals. They try so hard to ""be perfect"" and look, they have 3 stars. See what happens when you try way too hard?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=580

The hostess underestimated the waiting time; yet, they were friendly :). The waiter was nice and I liked his service. This made the dining experience very delightful, especially that I was with two wonderful friends.  I really enjoyed the bread they brought us to keep our hunger tamed. I would of, however, preferred if the bread was pre-sliced. Margarine spread? I prefer butter hehe. The ""Tex-Mex Egg Rolls"" were okay, they could of added some black beans and more corn and some roasted poblano chiles. Oh, they could of accompanied it with a roasted tomato-tomatillo-cilantro salsa. The avocado dip was a little bland. The Garlic Noodles dish was good. I really liked the idea of having some shiitake mushrooms with asparagus and oven-roasted tomatoes and Parmesan. I tried my friend's Fried Zucchini dish with ranch and I believe there could be a great improvement! Why ranch? Ranch is just so plain! Why not a BBQ Ranch dressing or a lemon ranch with cilantro dressing? Or or or ahhh the possibilities.  Overall, I would go again to try the cheesecake loll. The other food, not so much :0.

Ashley C.,"Henderson, NV",14,35,,4.0,7/17/2012,"Last Saturday was lovely and spent in Old Towne Pasadena-Just the little one and I...I do not know the name of the street but there is a parking structure nestled near the Pottery Barn (there is a pizza place right there) Parking is $6 but its really easy to get in and out of and its centrally located. I digress... We walked around a bit and it was more crowded than I expected due to it being nearly 95 degrees that afternoon...We got severely over heated and I was just looking for a place with some air conditioning where we could sit down for a bit. Alas, Cheesecake Factory!! I love this place in general but I have never eaten at this location before. I was afraid there would be a wait (It was about 4:30 pm) but luckily we were seated immediately at one of the 2 seater booths that look out onto Colorado. We truly enjoyed the people watching as we sipped our drinks ( Me: Kim Crawford Savignon Blanc- Her: Lemonade in a kids cup) I really couldnt decide what to eat because it was kind of between lunch and diiner. Finally I decided on the skinnylicious Veggie Burger- When it came out it had mayo on it which I was surprised by since it is the ""skinny"" version but its all good. And the veggie burger was just that....quite good!! It was made with beets and I love love love beets!! Never had a veggie burger made from beets before... I must say though...that the beets gave the burger a strange reddish color and I couldnt help but think that onlookers who did not know it was a veggie burger must have been grossed out as it looked like I was eating very undercooked hamburger. Our waitress was nice; she seemed kinda new but was more than pleasant and even refilled our kids cup with diet coke for me to send us on our way back out to the heat. All in all...good meal, good service, good day...would go back.  P.S- There are alot of great restaurants in Old Towne so if there is a huge wait at Cheesecake, go check out what else the city has to offer!!

Lisa S.,"Long Beach, CA",1311,1836,312,3.0,5/21/2007,"I'm already not the biggest fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  My friends used to drag me to the one in Redondo Beach after dances like Winter Formal and Valentine Royalty.  My friend and I once had a fight with our dates about who would pay the tab (the guys wanted to pay for us, and she insisted that she pay her own way, because she was an independent girl who would not take charity from any man, and because I was young and impressionable, I followed suit).  We ended up leaving a $50 tip, because everyone paid (the guys for themselves and us, and us for us).   How stupid.   Now that I'm older and much, much wiser, I wouldn't dream of denying a man the satisfaction of paying the bill.  Hey, I welcome it.  Come on guys...I don't say no. Anyways, now that that little plug is out there....I had a bowtie pasta dish at the one in SF, which has a wonderful view from the balcony (making it about worth it) that tasted like crap.  Diego and I went at the Block after the last Harry Potter, and he loves the place.  He swears by the chicken chop, which honestly, wasn't all that bad. So, Saturday night, we're in the car and we can't figure out where to eat, when suddenly, Diego yells out ""CHICKENNNN CHOOOOOOPPP!!!""  I'm like, dude, calm down, and we proceed to Pasadena. So the wait is ridiculous.  It was 6-something, and the girl says 10 to 20 minutes, which is okay, except I hear people mumbling around me that it's 10 to 20 minutes their ass and that they've been waiting more like 30-40 minutes.   This is not a good sign, because we have somewhere to be by 8, but I think we have enough time, and regardless, Diego is out parking the car and I forgot my cellphone in the passenger seat. After about 30 minutes we get seated.  Lo and behold, there is no longer any chicken chop.  So that was the ultimate disappointment of the century for Diego.  After crying for a good ten minutes, he ordered the chicken and biscuits, which were only okay, and I got the chicken medallions, which were dry and stuck to the hot plate.  The spinach was literally dessicated against the white plate as though a leaf pressed in a book.  Blah.  Moreover, it took them ALMOST AN HOUR to give us our food.  This was totally ridiculous, especially since we were in a rush.  I wanted to order dessert, but we just didn't have the time. Oh, and Diego knocked his water over, and this manager lady was all over us, apologizing up the ying yang for like five minutes.  Then, when Diego explained it was his own fault, *poof* she was like ""see ya!"" and left.  I thought that was lame. Probably won't come back here anytime soon, especially since Diego's menu item has been extricated.  I absolutely adore their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, but you can get that frozen at Costco, along with three other flavors (12 slices total) for $20, so it's no biggie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=600

We had lemonade to drink, free refills YAY. for the main course he had well I can recall what it is called but it was green pasta with two chicken breasts and prosciutto and arugula salad on top enough to feed two people and then some  I had the jambalaya pasta cost 16.99 and man its a whole Lotta pasta. Honestly we were beyond stuffed at this point but hello you can not come here and leave with out trying the cheesecake so we both ordered two different ones I had the red velvet cheesecake and he had the snickers cheesecake we also took one to go for the sister. and we had two hot drinks with that dessert. See what I mean we went over board. Next time we skip the appetizers, share a plate and slit a cheesecake.

kush e.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,36,17,4.0,2/4/2010,"This review will not rely heavily on this particular location's culinary prowess, but their knowledge of cook times & overdone vs. underdone because it's The Cheesecake Factory. The food is good, but it's not imaginative.  As a Cheesecake Factory fan (I swear, it's the ""chocolate"" bread [you know, their free wheat bread that I gave a special & fitting nickname to] that keeps me coming back), I can safely say I've tasted about 85% of their dishes. I'll list the dishes that stood out to me (if you're looking for burger reviews, LOL go somewhere else with that shit). 1) Jambalaya with pasta. I always, always order this with extra sauce on the side because the sauce is delicious & you cannot go wrong with extra sauce. The Pasadena location is the only location that can consistently cook this pasta to perfection which is a make or break on a dish like this.  2) Angel hair with shrimp. It's a simple pasta, probably something I could whip up at home, but the tomatoes at least TASTE fresh & the shrimp & pasta are both perfectly cooked (at all locations).  3) Jamaican black pepper shrimp. I was feeling adventurous when I first ordered this one &....it's a mood thing. It's not a default order (jambalaya)...you know how you always have that one dish you always feel guilty for ordering ALL THE TIME. The spice is nice, the mango salsa is what you'd expect, & the beans are tolerable (I hate the texture of beans, but these are flavorful enough to make up for it).  4) Shrimp scampi. Honestly, no one can mess this dish up, but somehow (Cheesecake Factory, La Brea), you did. Pasadena on the other hand, you have never disappointed me. So one time I was practically swooning over the scampi & my friend is curious, so she has a bite & exclaims, ""WHAT THE HELL THAT'S ALL BUTTER?"" I gave her a blank look & since then, I've questioned our relationship.  Although the wait times can get ridiculous at night, if you're ever going to a Cheesecake Factory, I'd go with this location. Followed closely by the one at The Grove. Even with the headache over parking & paying somebody money to park my car somewhere just so I can pay someone to make food I was to lazy to make, these two places win over all the others.

(Around $5-6 a piece)  The service is typically good, the waiters are attentive and your meal arrives on a timely manner.  *Subject to change",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=600
Solida N.,"Pasadena, CA",60,29,,2.0,6/29/2013,"Only because this is a franchise. I like this place in regards to their dishes. Anyways, my review for this particular cheesecake factory is based on their services. I have probably gotten a handful of excellent service, more A-OKay service and a few really bad service. But those few really bad service is what stood in my memory of this place. My boyfriend and I were seated for 15 minutes (we timed it after like being seat for 5 minutes) and no one came by. After 15 minutes, thirsty and already flipped through the menu several times, we already knew what we wanted. When he came by, we ordered our dish. He didn't come by with our waters, which we asked another waiter to get us. When the food came out, he didn't bring it out (which was fine) but he never came by to check on up. By the time we were done with our meal, he decided to come by. AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES ME THE MOST FURIOUS. As he came by, he didn't stop at our table but instead continue walking and talking. Like a drive by. He came by with our check and we never saw him again. So you're wondering if we tipped him... HECK NO! Gratitude is a privilege that is earned and he definitely didn't earn it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=600

So we end up at Chainstorecake Factory. After a delightful 50 minute wait, standing on faux-marble, we are taken to our table by what appears to be a Junior High scool aged student. Poor girl. They better be paying her at least minimum wage. The kicker was our waiter, who obviouly thought he was the most gorgeous man to rove the planet, and wanted to make sure that we thought so too. I'm all for a flity waiter, after all, it can be fun - and lead to fun things, but this guy was way too into himself. Funny thing is that I've seen him around the bars over the past couple of years, and has got quite the reputation about him. Let's just just say that I know things that I shouldn't repeat here on yelp! All that to say, as hot as his body was, his attitude ruined it for all of us.

J C.,"La Canada, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/4/2010,"The Cheesecake factory still remains on our family's TOP TEN list, simply because of the variety and affordability.  When paying for an extended family of 20, it's difficult to find a place that surpasses this place in terms of accomodations, family-friendly atmosphere, quality, and quantity. Granted, many of the dishes do taste similar, but if you venture to try something new every time you go, you eventually find that they do have a decent variety of dishes that are authentic in their own way.   This is my ideal place for a date night, but I'd be happy to bring my family here any time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=600

Aaron C.,"Los Angeles, CA",295,156,,4.0,5/19/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory chain has always been able to please no matter where the location is. I've been to the Pasadena location quite a number of times now and I've always left fuller, fatter, and happy. For lunch they have a good number of smaller sized lunch portions for a good price. Then for dinner they take out the big guns. I've tried most of the pastas and I have to say each one them are really different and unique. Same goes for their steaks and most of all, their cheesecakes. List of my favorite dishes (not ranked in order because I like all of them) PASTA DA VINCI Sauteed Chicken, Mushrooms, Onions and Garlic in Madeira Wine Sauce with Penne Pasta and Parmesan ~This is one of their better pastas because it tastes like no other. The pasta is never overcooked (and this goes for all their pasta) and you could really taste every individual ingredient. The overall flavor is more salty than your typical and the wine sauce really makes this dish great. PASTA CARBONARA Spaghettini Tossed with Smoked Bacon, Sweet Green Peas and a Light Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce ~I love the texture of the bacon with the pasta. It adds a bit of crunch instead of the all over mushy feeling. I usually hate green peas but these sweet ones really pull it off. The sauce is not overly dousing either. GRILLED SKIRT STEAK Served with Mashed Potatoes, Vegetables and Crisp Onions ~I get this a lot. Not only is it a good sized steak for the price, but its sauce is sooo good. This can fill anyone up. FILET MIGNON with French Fries and Onion Strings ~Of course the most tender steak that his restaurant has to offer, but also the most expensive. Very tasty indeed HIBACHI STEAK Slices of Hanger Steak and Sauteed Shiitake Mushrooms over Onions, Bean Sprouts and a Soy Steak Sauce. Served with Tempura Asparagus and Wasabi Mashed Potatoes ~Now this is something new that most other restaurants don't offer or haven't even thought of. It's more of a Japanese styled steak that really makes the steak exotic. It tastes more salty and has that nice wasabi mashed potato. If you're not a wasabi fan don't order! GRILLED CHICKEN AND AVOCADO CLUB Grilled Chicken Breast with Avocado, Bacon, Tomato, Melted Swiss and Herb Mayonnaise. Served with French Fries ~I probably really like this because the name includes two of my most favorite ingredients. They really compliment each other nicely in this sandwich and that's what makes it so good. The mayo mixed with the swiss is a very nice experience too. and for cheesecakes: ORIGINAL GODIVA CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE  CHOCOLATE OREO MUDSLIDE CHEESECAKE  30th ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE You can tell that I'm a chocolate lover and yes all of these chocolate cheesecakes are actually different in some way. But really all of them are really good, it's just what's your favorite topping!

First of all, our party of 10 or so people got there without a reservation so we had to wait a heck of a long time to be seated at a long table which would be conducive to our celebration.  Not good.  The hostess made it up to us by giving us three free appetizers of our choice.  Now that's what I'm talkin about.  Why don't more places comp food in order to appease their patrons.  The appetizers were tasty too, avocado eggrolls, spicy buffalo wings and taquitos. I'd definitely order the first two items again.... surprisingly good! Second, our food came out very quickly even though the place was very crowded, and every one of us commented on how happy we were with what we ordered.  My fiance ordered a $20 steak, which was tender and cooked perfectly.  I ordered the ""Evelyn's Favorite"" pasta and couldn't stop talking about how good it was, etc. etc.   Next, I wasn't happy with the Manhattan that I ordered so they took it back and made me a Mojito without any complaint whatsoever.   Finally, our group was extremely ear-piercingly loud!  There were patrons that actually moved out of the room to get away from us.  However, our waiter was never a jerk to us asking us to keep it down or anything.

Davy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",178,21,26,1.0,7/22/2008,"I might be a little biased here, as I'm not a huge fan of most chain restaurants, but seriously...if you're commuting from great lengths away to visit Old Town, why choose this place? There are plenty of other great non-chain restaurants that deserve a taste. My first and fondest memories of Cheesecake Factory was on the top floor of Macy*s in SF, a good 8 years ago. Ever since, Cheesecake Factory had never failed to disappoint me. We came to the Pasadena location a few years ago for a friend's birthday (an obligation if you'd ask me) and the lobby was crowded to the max. There were people waiting outside as well and even though we had a reservation, we still had to wait with the rest of the folks. You'd think it's a fire hazard or something. My friends ordered the Vietnamese Spring Rolls. The price was ridiculous. If you want good spring rolls, you go to the dirty hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurants in Westminster or ""Golden Deli"" in San Gabriel. You'll be paying for double the amount AND taste but minus the over-inflated price.  I tried the teriyaki salmon and it was dry as a brick. For that price, I'd much rather go to a Japanese restaurant where they make it much better.  I guess the cheesecake is pretty good, although more and more patisseries are coming up with better ones. If you really want to come here, just order the cheesecake to-go and leave as soon as you can wiggle your way through!  Instead of eating mock-cultural food, go to the actual restaurants instead, where you get much better tasting food.

Travelist H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,5.0,1/30/2011,"Seriously this is some the of the best customer service I have ever had! I'm comparing this to places like, Tavern on the green, Matisse, Valentinos, French Laundry, Spago's etc. This is a big time date place, if you walk by the north side of the restaurant (Colorado blvd) you see a lot of first dates, people on their best behavior, men acting like gentlemen, women ordering salads, very funny. All the while people walking by are looking at the girls legs, what food they are eating and making obscene gestures, it's quite uncomfortable for the couples there. Anyways since it is one of these date places the service is excellent, never an empty glass, condiments always ready, pepper is peppered, parmesan cheese is on call, etc. etc. the servers are super polite and super helpful. The food is good, it's Cheesecake factory, pretty consistent no matter which one you go to, everybody loves the salads and the jumbalaya, great sandwiches and I personally always get breakfast. So the food is 3 and a half stars but the service takes it to 5.  If your willing to wait 2 hours for a table (weekend evenings) and you want variety with good service this is the place to go. Less of a wait on weekdays and daytime hours, but not by much. Don't get me wrong Cheescake factory is ok, but is it really worth the wait? If you want to wait that long just go to Ago in Los Angeles where even if you have a reservation they make you wait 1 hour, but obviously the food is a lot better. Oh yeah and if you like a bunch of guys staring at your dates sexy legs all night and seeing what you can't see, since the table is in you way, sit by the windows, good times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=640

I shouldn't have been.  The miso salmon was flaky, moist. . .and had miso PASTE on top!!  Which meant it was floating on my tongue in an explosion of sweet, salty, tangy, and well, miso-y.  The spinach was drained properly. . .and it was just absolutely how I remembered Cheesecake's miso salmon to taste like.  My mother got the pasta da vinci. . .it was absolutely delicious.  The sauce was creamy, the pasta was al dente, and the chicken was moist (if a little bit on the big size).  My dad got the cheesesteak sandwich. . .he liked it though I didn't try it.  My parents dug their fries. . .they said it wasn't greasy but still very crispy. What sucked about THIS Cheesecake versus the one at Bella Terra was that the service was pretty bad.  The bread came out late. . .and even though we were seated swiftly. . .we waited for almost 40+ min. before our food arrived.  So. . .do I come here for bad and slow service but good food?  Or do I go to Bella Terra and get served crap but with smiling, happy, and accommodating waiters/waitresses??? Why can't I have it all? (I think this combination only exists at the Bev Hills location, cos let me tell you. . .the one near Westwood has a fleet of ATROCIOUS waitstaff).

Michael S.,"Verdugo City, La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",104,123,,2.0,4/12/2007,"I have this theory.   Considering the enormity of the menu at Cheesecake Factory, yet the complete generic-ness of it, I have a theory.    While the business briefs may not support this,  I believe that there is in fact some mega-restaurant corporations (full of old white guys with no taste buds) that owns all of the major mid-level national chains.  When I say mid-level, I'm talking Friday's, Applebee's, Chili's,  Outback, Olive Garden, PF Changs, etc, etc, Longhorn Steakhouse....Don Pablos...you get the idea.  Anyway, this evil corporation owns 'em all.   When trying to come up with the Next Big Chain Restaurant some executive at this corporation had this idea:  "" Why don't we open a restaurant that offers all the favorites, and some not so favorite dishes from all our other restaurants, that way we don't have to come up with ANY new ideas - we can put ads in the menu so we don't have pay for any thing, either"".   Another taste-budless co-worker replied,  ""This is a GREAT idea, but we need a hook...hmmm"".   Yet another replied ""I got it!  We'll package it all up with 8 gajillion different types of imagination-less cheesecake.  People love cheesecake, almost as much as they love crappy frozen yogurt from TCBY."" And thus, yet another boring over-crowded, personality-less, you don't matter, eat your food and get out, chain restaurant was born.  At a subsequent meeting: Old executive, ""We gotta make this place stand out. I know, we won't make the wait-staff wear flair, and we'll plop our over-bloated asses next to every mall from Augusta, ME to Los Angeles"" I really don't like this restaurant.  After my first visit, I've only gone back to compromise with friends.  The food isn't even worth reviewing since they have literally ripped off every chain restaurant in the book - hell, they even have White Castle Sliders as an appetizer!?!

The menus are epic, so I figure there's something there for just about anyone.  We went on a Saturday night. In my opinion, the wait was minimal, but it's pretty loud.  I had a glass of Riesling which was surprisingly tasty. B ordered the Pasta da Vinci and I ordered the crab cake sandwich which is served with lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. I don't know what I expected. I had a specific taste and texture in my mind. The brioche was toasted with butter or something. It would have been better on a hard dry roll. B's pasta was actually pretty good and the waitress grated parmesan on top.  And of course, we ordered cheesecake and it was good.

Great choice to share between two people because one peice is very big.  Complemented with a side salad that is REALLY good too.  For appetizers, get their shrimp popcorn.  And their strawberry lemonade is good too.  I am making myself hungry now at 9:40 a.m.  If you are allergic to seafood, I am sorry that this won't help you very much in your own personal choices.  And I am also sorry that you won't be able to try these great dishes.  [stars and comments are subject to change with each visit (^_^) ]",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=680

There's always a line, but the food is consistently good, the portions huge, and the cheesecake? Well, I don't like cheesecake, but I love this stuff.  I used to mess around and order a bunch of things, but I've learned it's all good and  now just stick with what I love - the salads, especially the Chinese Chicken Salad. My boyfriend usually split the dinner sized one since they are way too big to tackle alone.  Appetizers a good too if you're with a crowd. I say go with the avocado egg rolls: rich, crispy, creamy and sweet. Yum! Bar drinks are okay, pricey and kinda weak given the big glasses they come in. I'd take the sober route and order a lemonade. It comes in a big frosty mug rimmed with sugar... sweet and sour! I made the mistake once of looking at the nutrition values of the cheesecake and I've had a hard time not feeling guilty with every bite since then, so I only save it for special occasions (don't worry, I won't ruin it for you!). But like I said, I don't even like cheesecake, but every now and then I just can't resist theirs, it even makes it worth the gross indulgence. Always a good standby when I'm with my family because there is something for everyone or if I am just craving a meal I know will be good.

Peter D.,"Pasadena, CA",1114,219,69,4.0,2/18/2010,"3 3/4 stars..This week, I awoke amidst a dream. The vision that I discovered was that of a restaurant. It was of one that carried my disappointment, but also found amid that shrouded darkness of that night, a forgiving hand in an executioner. Who was the foggy institution that prodded the inspired vision of my pillow? It was a child's will that lead the hand of fate and fulfilled my very dream. My daughter Lauren's birthday had arrived and she confided in me that she was emotionally bond to a single restaurant, The Cheese Cake Factory.  She maturely penned in my calendar, a lunch date for two. I was worried for the falling sands of the hourglass had taught me that time was fleeting and less then an hour to eat and return Snow White to school was a work of fiction I have no lasting disappointment with CCF, but they have done their utmost to confuse me. Let me place my Dr Phil cap on for a moment, minus the degree (stated for legal reasons); why do people insist on waiting in long lines for adequate but not inspired food selections? It may be the herd mentality; a person swayed by others eagerness, also known as a line. On their behalf, CCF is consistently reliable and steady. They do offer a lunch specials till 5 p.m., most items falling below the ($10) range.  I tackled the herb crusted fillet of salmon for ($12.95), it was good and reliable. That appears to be a thought this week, reliable food selections. Be prudent in selecting items here as they build confidence in many of their food selections but do stumble in some as well. My daughter Lauren went Paris Hilton on me and ordered the Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta for ($16.95).  She either tired of the meal or I was very fortunate to firmly secure two very delectable shrimp.   If you have been to The Cheese Cake Factory you know that they have advertisements inside their menu. It irritates me but is an acceptable reality. What is beginning to bothering me though, and I need to verify produces prices, restaurants are now charging ($9) and above for chips and guacamole, and that includes CCF. They do offer an eclectic array of dishes that calm the beast and nurture the butterfly in any group and it would be false to say that other restaurants risk and attempt to service the limitless cravings of our ethnically diverse Californians. They do get credit for trying and walking the tightrope here.  The menu starts off by saying, ""The best possible food and service."" The spirit of their motto is felt in the seats and upon every fork of the restaurant!! Even with the throng of people on this day, they almost made a work of fiction a best seller on the nonfiction list.

We ordered and it took about half an hour for our food to arrive with the bread long gone and water nearly empty. Only 2 of the orders arrived but I assumed the other 2 would follow shortly. WRONG. We patiently waited about 15-20 minutes for the other half of our party's food to arrive. No apologies or updates were given. My steak was cool ( even with the waiting, much cooler than expected) and undercooked. I requested medium well and it came medium rare. I attempted to force a few bites down because I NEVER send food back for fear of retribution. Couldn't do it so I requested a different order. Waitress seemed the tiniest bit bothered but she put the order in and I waited an additional 25 minutes for my meal with no water.

But when my friend suggested it, I thought, ""why not give it another try?""  We came the night of the Superbowl, so the place was not ridiculously busy. In fact, it was kind of empty. However, this did not stop our host from making us wait 10-15 minutes while they ""fixed our table"". Yeah right. So they finally sat us down, and our server approached us a few minutes later. She asked if we were ready to order and I replied with, ""I think we need a few more minutes to decide"". She had this impatient, frustrated look on her face and said, ""Oh you need more time?"" like that was the most ridiculous request she had ever heard. So both my friends ordered drinks and we started off with avocado egg rolls for appetizer. I remembered how much I liked it at BJ's and wanted to try their version here. Ehh, BJ's was definitely way better. Then we ordered our main entrees. I got the Cajun Jambalaya, because I had read on Yelp that a lot of people liked it and it also said on the menu that it was their most popular pasta dish. It was A-Ok. I'm not a big fan. In fact, I only ate about 1/4 of it because the portion was huge. None of my friends finished their food either. I ordered a tropical martini (Absolut vodka with pineapple, mango, and one other fruit) , which I expected to be fruity and fresh. It was a tad on the sweet side, like candy, so I didn't enjoy it too much. It actually tasted better to me once the ice melted and watered it down. We finished off with tiramisu cheesecake, which I surprisingly liked. I would've liked to try their red velvet cheesecake with white chocolate (the actual name escapes me), but I know that I wouldn't have been able to finish it by myself.

My personal favorites are the Firecracker Salmon Roll; strawberry lemonade; sourdough bread and the shrimp with fetuccine.  I'd love to be able to have my daughter's wedding reception here -- when that time comes, of course.   I went here with a large group back in December 2006.  The Cheesecake Factory's waiting area is usually VERY crowded, especially during this time of year.   I had been waiting a few doors down @ the Apple store before heading back to The Cheesecake Factory look out for our group.  One of our table mates became quite enthused when guests at other tables began to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to their guests of honor that she starting singing ""Happy Birthday"" and the rest of our table joined in too.

Most importantly to me is that it is sugar free. Once I get home I'll indulge in one slice and save the other in my freezer for a special occasion.

Ernesto Q.,"San Francisco, CA",8,13,10,2.0,4/8/2008,"I really love The Cheesecake Factory, but this location sucks. My server and my host were really nice but the two people who brought out our food were terrible. To start with they looked really unhappy. When I asked a question about the food one of them stared blankly at me and the other just strait out said I DON'T KNOW. I thought they paid big money to train the Cheesecake Factory team? Almost every meal I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory has been good. I decided to try the Vegetable Chopped Salad. It sounded really good on the menu but in real life it was kind of gross and not worth the price. It was supposed to have asparagus in the salad; you seriously had to search for the four tiny pieces that they put in this salad. The dressing was really nasty. When I tried to ask questions and voice my concern with the salad the staff had nothing to say. They did not offer me something else, they did not offer to take it off my bill even though it was clear I did not eat very much of it. I love the sweet corn tamale cakes. Such a great sauce and amazingly fresh avocado on top... but this time they were cold in the middle. Usually they are great about refilling your ice tea or Arnold Palmer's but not this location.

jeremy t.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,,4.0,6/18/2008,"Tips from a former Employee of this location:  If you're going on a weekend night, go early (5:30 or earlier) or late (10 or later) or risk getting caugth in the ""refugee camp"" outside, some waiting up to 3 hours for a table. Sometimes you get lucky. I tend to go to Louise's Trattoria across the street, have a fantabulous dinner and see the same people waiting outside when I leave. Is the wait worth it? That's for you to decide.  The food is the richest, most fattening food I've ever served (my server career ended 7 years ago). It's also some of the most delicious. They have a special ""lab"" out in Woodland Hills to create the dishes including new cheesecakes. I'm not going to give away corporate secrets but 2 specialty cheesecake has 3000 calories, 150 grams of fat and 75 or 80 grams of saturated fat. And it's out of this world! There's a reason CCF doesn't disclose nurtitional information on pretty much all of it's items.  For those who haven't been, the portions are huge enough to satisfy even the large SUV set. When my partner and I go, we usually order 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 1 entree and a dessert. We always take food home when we do this.  Another hint: If you're craving CCF but don't want to go through the wait, order to go and pick it up at the front.  My one gripe about this location is that it's the smallest location except Beverly Hills (the original). They should have leased the space next door and maybe the refugee camp would be smaller. Sometimes it covers the entire southwest corner of Colorado and Fair Oaks as well as wrapping around the sides. Now with the CCF locations opened in Glendale and Arcadia, we'll see how the business holds up.  Imitators be damned (Granville..cough), this is the original ""coffee shop for rich people"".

Good oil (virgin olive) or bad (canola), it's an incessant pool of slow, indigestible scum in your tum.   There's a lot of waiting involved, so CF is a no-go if your movie starts in a half hour or if you're simply impatient. On any given weekend night (starting Friday) ESPECIALLY, you might be waiting anywhere from 30 minutes - 2 hours. No joke. It also takes awhile for a server to take your order (especially if you have an indecisive party) and another two years for your drinks and food to come. Maybe its just me, but I'm paranoid over extremely dim-lighting. The place is lit by candles, so I wonder why appetizers are still $12+? Don't even get me started with the prices for drinks...

Lucy R.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",0,72,40,5.0,10/17/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is by far my favorite chain restaurant.  It is actually the place I choose when it's my night to choose dinner.  Service is usually good, but having worked there, allows me to understand the pressure that goes along with the job... it definitely was one of the more demanding serving jobs I have had.   When you first arrive they give you wheat and sourdough bread with butter, the wheat bread is the best I've ever had, it's best fresh when it's warm and soft.  My favorite dishes include the spicy chicken chipotle pasta which has a great smokey flavor, the asperagus and peppers and crunchy tortilla strips add a great contrast in texture.  The chicken piccata is also one of my favoirtes, I just have to order extra sauce because it can be dry at times... the capers, mushrooms and angel hair pasta are great in the dish.  The steak diane had a good sweetness to it, the steak is always tender.  I love the fact that my son gets their grilled chicken with spinach whenever we go, he is normally a chicken tender kid, but enjoys the grilled chicken here.  All their portions are huge, even their lunch portions.  My husband and I always split so we can try to save room for dessert.  Occassionally we'll get one meal and split between my husband, son and I and we are still left full and having to get our dessert to go.  Even their cups of soups are hearty meals. Although it is famous for their cheesecakes, I have to admit that my favorite dessert is the Apple Crisp, it's so warm and sweet and the ice cream melts and the whole dish tasts creamy, I love it. The fresh banana cheesecake is surprisingly refreshing and light, I'm not even a banana fan and I love this cheesecake.  The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is good too, I'm not a white chocolate fan, but it's not bad for having white chocolate shavings on it.  Their black tie is really good and their chocolate cakes with ice cream are great to take home and have for breakfast. I know they really like to try to be consistent in all aspects, but it's not always the case, but their food is good enough to keep coming back.  We've never had a bad thing on the menu and although the prices seem high, the fact that the meals are big enough to split and have left overs compensates for it.  I would gladly pay $16 for a pasta dish because it can feed two of us and we often have left overs for one of us for the following day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=740

But sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone, take a risk, try the walking around the block and eating somewhere you've never been. I can't tell you how many times I've passed people on that street corner, went to eat somewhere, and returning from dinner crossing the same people, waiting at the same street corner an hour later....they must be hungry",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=740
Aleli C.,"San Dimas, CA",31,29,,2.0,5/29/2007,"It always amazes me how people line up outside on the streets just to get into this restaurant.  Why people dine here, I really don't know, considering how their food is bland and overcooked at best. They could also be held accountable for false advertising:  I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip only to be dismayed that there was no artichoke in the said spinach and artichoke dip. Service is usually so-so, but the last time I was here (which was a few weeks ago), it was particularly bad.  The manager was, perhaps, the nosiest little gopher in the world.  Ian and I had been sitting in the restaurant, starving our not-so-little asses off because our food was taking forever and a day to get to our table.  Manager came over and asked if everything was okay.  I said no because I was cranky from the 30-minute wait and my blood sugar level was running dangerously low.  I had also politely asked him to check up on our food to make sure that it was on its way.  Still, the manager kept insisting that something else was wrong, somehow insinuating that my crankiness wasn't a direct result of their super-slow service.   This made me want to get up and sucker punch the little fucker square in the nose, but I couldn't because again, starvation had sucked out what little energy I had left.  Whatever. When my food finally came to my table, it was half-cold, and my pasta was dry with absolutely no lemon cream sauce on it  (Chicken Piccata).  I was thoroughly disappointed by the way they half-assed my order.  And the waitress ignored me THRICE when I had asked her to fill my water glass up. I will never eat real food at Cheesecake Factory ever again. The place does deserve some kudos, though:  They do have good desserts.  Their strawberry shortcake is tasty, and the cheesecakes, I hear, are satisfying as well. In the end, my lesson learned is to never, ever waste money on anything else but the desserts on The Cheesecake Factory's menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=740

I got one of their new items, as if Cheesecake Factory really needs to ADD items to their already endless menu. It was called the Caramel Chicken. Not a good name if you ask me because it doesn't  taste like caramel one but. It tastes more like an Asian stir fry. Good nonetheless. I totally had room for cheesecake but I didn't wanna dish out the extra $8. Oh well, maybe next time. I was pretty surprised to find out that at lunch the wait was only 5 minutes.

K A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,16,,4.0,7/30/2009,"I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and as of yet I have not had a bad experience there (knock on wood).  I like the fact that they have a hugely diverse menu, yet execute everything (at least everything I've personally tried) well.  That is not an easy feat...I know this because I've worked in the restaurant business for almost 6 years...and I watch a lot of Gordon Ramsay.  Anyway, back the subject.  I work right down the street from this particular cheesecake factory, but had yet to venture there.   I decided today would be the day, seeing as how it's National Cheesecake Day, and all the cheesecakes would be half off!  And boy oh boy do I love me some good cheesecake...yum... So I took my favorite guy and we went down to the place, and were seated immediately.  I don't remember my server's name, but he was very nice.  My boyfriend got the peach smoothie, which he talks about whenever the word 'peach' is uttered in his earshot, and which he has been raving to me about for months.  I'm not a huge peach fan, but I could see it's appeal, and it was more than pleased with it.  We got the fried artichoke hearts as an appetizer, they were good, but I thought the dipping sauce was a little bland.  We both decided to be adventurous and try dishes we had never tried there...I usually get the pork chops---sooooo good, or the orange chicken, or the teriyaki chicken.  I settled on the Chicken di panna and he got the Spicy Cashew Chicken.  My chicken was flattened and lightly breaded with a subtle creamy white wine sauce, broccoli, and mashed potatoes.  I don't like my broccoli mushy, but it seemed a little too raw for my liking.  The potatoes were great- I could eat potatoes in any form, I love them so much!  And the chicken was good.  Moist with a nice but not overpowering flavor.  A little lemon on it and it was perfect.   My boyfriend simply adored the Cashew Chicken, it was nice and spicy like he likes it, and the chicken was moist but with just a bit of crunch on the outside.  I tasted some and I have to say I might just order that next time I go there.  He said he liked it more than most chinese places he's had cashew chicken at...I don't know if I'd go that far, but he's white...really white.  But it was good.  Oh, and did I mention the bread?  I love that brown bread with some butter!  We ended the meal with a couple of slices of cheesecake to go...that was the whole point of going anyway.  I am still full from my meal...which I ate 5 hours ago and didn't even finish but brought home in a doggy bag, but I am looking very forward to it!  I got the new Stefani's Red Velvet cheesecake, which combines two of my very favorite desserts and was just debuted today.  I'm sure it will be incredible.  So as for my first experience at this CF...I will definitely go here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=760

Their overpriced asparagus/sundried tomato/mushroom pasta was basically just pasta and oil with a spare piece of asparagus or two hidden somewhere. The avocado spring rolls were little more than plain, mushy avocado in eggroll (the description made it sound like avocado was only one component of the filling). The mojito I ordered tasted totally virgin, so I didn't even get a buzz to help me forget the food. My husband's pasta (called Evelyn's Favorite) literally tasted like plain noodles with dried oregano sprinkled over it.

The Chinese Chicken Salad is the best in the business and there is at least four dishes I have ordered that have a bit of the ""Oh My God this is good"" factor in the flavor. The Four Cheese Pasta is one. They are consistently good. Remember, the crowds are there for a reason. For a ""chain"" they really have an excellent menu. Again, its like knowing the type of movie you are going to see. If you know there will be a crowd, and a wait, then there is nothing to complain about. PS try the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta too.

We sat and the rest of our party showed up shortly. Drinks ordered, appetizers ordered and then main course ordered. Either they're quick and organized or our conversations kept us busy that we didn't even noticed.  I ordered the Moroccan chicken which was good. Not even sure what I decided to order until the very last minute. I normally go for the shrimp scampi but changed it at the very last minute. Not really sure why come to think of it. I just looked down when it was my turn to order and guess that's what I saw right in front of me. Whew... What the hell were we talking about that put me in that position? Anywho, it was a good choice cause the wifey was picking on my plate.  I had an iced tea cause I'm not an alchie. And coffee at the end. Tiramisu was amazing but too much whipped cream.

The kind that sneak up on you.  I stayed away from the chicken this time, no meat at all actually. I'm not risking being sick to my stomach for a week (!!!) again. For $5 at happy hour you get a really big serving of guacamole that they make freshly, it's probably the best deal they have. The corn tamale cakes were OK, a little mushy, not like the ones you can get at El Torito...the sauce that went with them was really zesty. The Thai noodle salad was decent. Service kind of sucked.

Dan B.,"Pasadena, CA",1,31,58,4.0,9/17/2011,"First of all, DON'T READ THE NUTRITIONAL GUIDE!!! If you do the above you will likely walk right back out of the place and let me tell you, you could be making a boo-boo. They serve a good range of dishes here and the service is usually very good. My standard dish is the four cheese pasta with chicken (1200 calories!) but I've also had a range of their burgers and steaks and my only complaint to date is a waiter thinking I was an air-steward (due to my British accent). If you get here after 7pm be prepared to wait 20 minutes before you are seated, maybe spend the time eyeing the fine selection of cheesecakes they have on display at the front of the 'factory'. I would recommended the Godiva chocolate and the original strawberry cheesecake, but again DO NOT check the calorie content. The prices here are reasonable compared to other surrounding eateries and the portion sizes, while no where near the size of a Maggiano's dish (their full portion spaghetti meatballs comes in a bucket and is 4900 claories - I kid you not, check it out), are still very good.

The good side - 1 star for good food.  My favorite dish is the chicken madera.  A wonderful dish.  2 grilled to perfection chicken breast, asparagus on top, with bacon, with mashed potato on the side with the addicting madera sauce. 1 star for the friendly service.  Staff are nice and the server was knowledgeable about the food.  Thanks for recommending the chicken madera.  I am a fan of that dish for life! 1 star for cheesecake.  Very good cheesecake.  Order if you have room for dessert at the end of the meal.

Missy J.,"Alhambra, CA",167,27,,1.0,7/19/2012,"I've had Cheesecake factory before, and this was definitely the worst experience I've ever had. Service - still exceptional, although the waiter kind of mixed up our food. I can't blame him because we were a group of ~15 people. Food - After careful examine the menu (since I had plenty of time because some of us were running a little late), I was going for either Garlic Noodles or Thai Noodles. But I didn't like Parmasean cheese so I finally settled on Evelyn's Favorite because I thought since this is someone's favorite, it must be good. (This is off their website) The ingredients were: Penne Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Garlic and Pine Nuts). It was a total mistake!! I mean, if this was cooked properly, it could taste better (Note that I didn't say fantastic, but it could be better). The pasta was dry and hard, meaning that the chef was probably felt too rushed with a big group order and had to drain my pasta early - for that the center was still uncooked. The egg plants were burned (not browned, but BURNED)! Come on chefs, don't treat us customers like we are idiots. Although I couldn't see well under the dark lighting inside the restaurant, and my food just looked like a black/white picture taken from an old camera, I have good taste buds and I could definitely taste the burned egg plants. I was being optimistic and thought, maybe it's just one piece, let me try another one. And it was burned as well. In fact, all the eggplants were burned! The pasta was super oily and not to mention the combination of herbs just made this dish a complete failure. For the price (I think it was $13-ish, and after tips ~$18), it was junk!!  Like I said, I've been to Cheesecake Factory a couple times, and the food wasn't good at all.

The J's H.,"West Hollywood, CA",28,157,40,4.0,4/18/2011,"Happy Hour Review  Having grown up in the Midwest, I can't help but love chain restaurants. For this reason, an afternoon trip to Pasadena with Nicandrew included a stop at the chain most cited as a portion-control-killing obesity cause, the Cheesecake Factory!! And I get it - their portions are kinda ridiculous. That's why you should just go for Happy Hour, have a fantastic cocktail and a large portion-ed appetizer and be on your merry way! Which is exactly what our crew did. We dropped in at 4pm, when Happy Hour starts and were glad we were just there for Happy Hour since there was a wait for the restaurant. Happy Hour is served at the bar area and at the nearby high-tables. A couple spots cleared at the bar when we arrived so we took a seat and then a few minutes to make a choice on their wicked-crazy food Happy Hour options; for real, so many delish-sounding options between $4-6! The drink choice was a little easier. Besides $5 well drinks, $5 wines by the glass, and $4 select draft beers, they also offer 4 classic cocktails - mojito, Long Island iced tea, margarita, cosmopolitan - and a specialty called J.W.'s Pink Lemonade for only $5. As dorky as it sounds, sometimes it's nice to see the specialty drinks listed out like that. I love Long Island's, but always seem to forget that they're out there waiting to be enjoyed. Seeing it listed on the menu - well, I just had to have one! Nic had a tasty margarita and Drew enjoyed the mojito, which our bartender freshly made right before us. All the drinks were pretty right on, but I think the mojito was my fav. After a starter of their delish white & honey-wheat (I think?) bread, Nicandrew ended up going with the artichoke-crab dip for $5.95 and I had an order of the Avocado Eggrolls served with a tamarind dipping sauce for $5. Being the Cheesecake Factory, the eggrolls were actually three whole eggrolls cut in half - more than enough food for one person! Awesomely good though. So that was the food and drink... The ambiance was kinda what you'd expect - a couple TVs going (1 sports, 1 CNN), a good-sized crowd for 4pm that was a little loud for my tastes. Luckily, and I don't know if it was because we were buzzed, but I swear when they dimmed the lights around 4:30, the crowd got quieter! I say dim lights all the time, baby! All in all, we had a fun time and the chain restaurant Happy Hour didn't disappoint! The only disappointment (and it's kinda major) is that I just don't understand why HH only runs weekdays from 4-6pm. I know people have more flexible schedules in Los Angeles, but all my working friends don't get off work until at least 5:30, so I'll never understand an HH that only lasts til 6, especially if it's weekday only. And for the Cheesecake Factory where Happy Hour is served at the bar-area only, I really don't think a 2-hour weekend HH could hurt business that much. HAPPY HOUR TIMES: Monday-Friday; 4-6pm DRINK DEALS: $5 Specialty Cocktails, well drinks & wines by the glass, $ 15 pitchers of sangria, $10 pitchers of beer, $5 wines by the glass, $4 select draft beers FOOD DEALS: Tons of Food options from $4-6",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-pasadena?start=540
