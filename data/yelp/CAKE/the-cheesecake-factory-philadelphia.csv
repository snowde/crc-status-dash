Lauren K.,"Philadelphia, PA",174,5,,3.0,7/31/2017,"Great restaurant, but bad experience at this location:  Overall, typically: great food, especially drinks and cheesecake, at relatively more expensive prices. Nice atmosphere.  Bad experience tonight: Went here for half off cheesecakes. Sat at a table by the bar around 8:30pm and ordered our three slices of cheesecake. After about ten minutes, the waiter came to us and told us they were backed up in the bakery so it would be longer. We waited a total of ~40minutes until our cheesecakes arrived, and this was after having our nice waiter check in on them twice. A quick bite for cheesecake turned into an hour and a half meal... Do not recommend coming in for half off cheesecakes, unless you are willing to really wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia
Kiki L.,"Los Angeles, CA",431,175,214,1.0,12/21/2017,"This place is a waste for its prime location. No prices on cocktail or draft beers, cheesecake menu.. ok so should we all be pretentious and pay for things we don't know the prices of?  Therefore I asked how much the PASSIONFRUIT mojito is, she said ""I believe it's around $11""...  im sorry... I believe? That could mean a lot of things. I don't want to order a drink and get a check of a cocktail for $14. If I wanted that I could go to Rumor.  After I asked for the cocktail price.. the waitress gave me a disdained look and never came back! Didn't even look at my friend and I again. Ok so I guess she assumed that we were poor cuz we asked the price of a mojito. After literally 15 Â minutes of no service, no water (cricket).. we LEFT. So I don't do this a lot, reviewing without trying the food. But here it is! My first and last Cheesecake Factory visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia
Belle S.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,34,8,1.0,11/30/2017,"Came here with my boyfriend last night as we were deciding between iHOP and the CF since we were both really hungry and just wanted filling food.  The first thing I noticed was that when our waiter brought over our water there were lemon slices floating in it. I'm not a health freak but I always prefer my lemon wedges on the side of the glass because who knows if they even washed them? Anyway it was just a passing thought and I didn't think anything of it.  I ordered the pasta carbonara and immediately I knew there was something wrong. The sauce tasted so bland, except where the waitress grated Parmesan cheese over. I added salt and pepper and there was barely any difference. Regardless, I finished about half of it before my boyfriend and I decided to take the rest of our food to go.  I got home and I felt really sick all of a sudden. I went to bed early and when I got up for work the next morning I had an upset stomach. I called out from work and thank God that I did because a half hour later I threw up all the fluids I drank that morning. I threw up two more times afterwards and had an upset stomach two more times later in the day.  I didn't associate this with anything until I called my boyfriend at work and he said it sounded like I had food poisoning. I read up on the symptoms of it and he was right. I was shaking, feeling feverish, and my hands and feet were tingling. I had lost so much fluids that every time I stood up I started seeing black and white and had to hold onto something.  My boyfriend has been in the industry for more than 20 years, owned restaurants, been a partner, and been a general manager. He said that when sauces are left out too long, they lose their taste, and that was probably why I got so sick. He said he noticed me seasoning my dish with salt and was surprised as places like the Cheesecake Factory have dishes with high calorie counts and are already so flavorful to the point of being unhealthy.  I called the restaurant and told Anthony the GM what I had experienced and he offered to give me a gift card. I said no thank you and would prefer a partial refund for at least my portion of the meal. He said that it was not possible. I even offered to bring in the food we had taken home for him to inspect but he said it was not necessary.  Due to his lack of assistance, I called the guest services line in California and they were much more kind even though they still refused to offer a refund, though they did offer to look into the issue. They offered a gift card as well and I was thinking to myself, ""are these people serious? They think I want to get food poisoning again for free this time."" I said even if they can't offer me a refund I don't need a gift card as I would never return.  Clearly TCF Is only interested in money and not winning their customers back or making sure their health inspection standards are on par. Thanks for nothing!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia
Sara K.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,12,2,1.0,10/23/2017,"As someone who is part of the industry and has been to Cheesecake multiple times, my friends and I were especially disappointed. The food was fine, you always know what to expect.  The service: To our server James, I guess he was having an especially bad day (we know bc he complained to us and our surrounding tables multiple times how he's been here all day). His banter with other tables as well as ours was EXTREMELY uncomfortable and inappropriate!!! Things were said that should NEVER be said as a server or by anyone in the service industry.  We waited an absurd amount for literally every part of our meal. We didn't get water or greeted for a good 10 minutes, in an empty restaurant. After we paid the check (which when we corrected him he told us to just give him $** amount bc I guess he didn't feel like changing it in the computer) and tipped him we waited around for our to go cheesecakes patiently even after everything, he finally came up to our table and said ""you can stay as long as you like I'm just gonna get this out of your way"" and took my friends tipped check and the menus, but ignored the empty dishes in front of us. Then we told him we're sitting here waiting for our cheesecakes, which he so obviously forgot. Even after very clearly letting him know how to separate them for the 3 of us he brought it over in one bag... I am extremely forgiving of service where ever I go, and never leave this long of a review, unless it is this bad and a place where I expect a higher standard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia

Madeline D.,"Palmetto Bay, FL",489,5,,2.0,1/14/2018,"First of all, brunch starts at 10.. we arrived at 10 and the doors were still locked. Finally the manager came down to unlock them and also sat us at a table since the hostess was MIA. As we walked through the restaurant to our seats I noticed that every single chair was THITHY. Covered in crumbs and food smears. I cleaned my chair with a napkin before sitting because it was so dirty. Our water had chunks of food or something in it. Dirty tables, dirty walls, dirty seats. Food was awful. Bread chewy like it had been frozen. Salt at the table was stuck together because it had gone bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia
Linda T.,"Queens, NY",128,257,924,4.0,7/7/2017,"This was my 1st time EVER trying the Cheesecake Factory in general. The one in Queens, New York is always packed and has a long wait. My friends told me that the one in Long Island, New York was the same thing. We found this place randomly while walking around looking for a place to eat for dinner. The place here is HUGE and we were seated right away. I'm not sure if people were away for the long July 4th weekend, but I was surprised that the place wasn't crowded. Many of the entree options are 1,500+ calories! I'm not surprised because I have heard on the news before that entrees at Cheesecake Factory have high calorie count. We ordered our entrees from the SkinnyLicious Menu. I opted for the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp and it comes with Angel Hair pasta. It was delicious and the shrimp tasted pretty fresh. The food portions were just right and I wasn't overly stuffed. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. She was happy to fulfill our requests. Our utensils and my napkin cloth were slightly dirty in the beginning and she got replacements for us. She checked up on us often to see if we needed anything else too. We didn't eat cheesecake here since we were full. Maybe next time we'll leave some room for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia
Morris B.,"Philadelphia, PA",638,65,155,4.0,5/9/2017,"As ya'll know, I had a bad chicken casear salad from here last week, which I have to say in retrospect was an isolated incident because I went yesterday for Happy Hour and the food and drinks were AMAZING as usual! I normally only get cheesecake while i;m here but the adventurous side of me said ""bruh, lets get some carrotcake"".  And lemme tell ya...the Carrotcake was arguably the best I've had. I've had some good carrotcake in my short life, but the cheescake factory carrot cake was HUGE and very moist! Well worth the $8 value!  The Nachos are really...really..really good, too. It's usually all I can handle unless i'm sharing some with my greedy friends, i mean hungry friends. I'm actually going to attempt to try the chicken casear salad again because I'm confident it was a one-time thang.  Thangs happen, yanno??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia
Cindy M.,"Lansdowne, PA",274,562,3259,2.0,7/13/2017,This visit was a bust which makes me sad as we visited with out of town guests. We ordered apps which were good (nachos and artichoke and crab dip).  Hubby had a kale salad We barely started and our food came out.  Hubby was only able to finish half his salad which he held above the table since there were too many large plates (there were 5 of us). I ordered the combination ($22 approx) which had my favorite chicken merdiera with a salmon. Â The chicken was so small that it was disappointing. Â The salmon was drowned in a green chopped parsley (type) that I could not even tell it was salmon. Â See my pic One plate didn't come out for about 10 min later so we all waited and ate our food cold. Â I mean if you're going To bring the food out early bring it out together. Everyone's else said the food was good  Waitress was eh. I think I was more disappointed that she didn't say anything when my husband was eating in the air w his bowl  The others had dessert but I was so turned off by my meal that I didn't bother.  $200 later and I was disappointed  Wish I spent a bit more and went to Delfriscos.  Yes I'll try again but I know to avoid the combo and wait to order my meal Â  Â I guess w most chains u get a hit or miss you waitress and you have to know the tips when ordering I should add the last few times we visited everything is great... this visit was just so disappointing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia
Sherry X.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,79,99,3.0,5/26/2017,"FYI: Their portion sizes are HUGE and the calorie count definitely matches what you get so you might be eating a full days worth of calories in a single meal.  The fiancÃ© and I were in center city on a date night sorta type thing and came here before checking out some DIY wedding supplies at the AC Moore nearby. Let's just say....it's been a while. WHAT I GOT: Grilled fish tacos PROS: First of all, I gotta give it up to our waiter. He was legit the sweetest person ever with the way he talked to us and served us during the meal that it made up for the lack of flavor in our food. And I also appreciate the fact that the Cheesecake Factory lists the calorie count of their food. I mean, for how big their portions are, you can kinda guess how much you're taking in but it's also good to have a set number. The food was cooked pretty well: nice moist chicken and flaky fish. All the ingredients tasted fresh and there were some good flavor combinations in my taco. The ambiance of this place is also pretty cozy and definitely family friendly. CONS: Where to start...well for starters, my taco shells were uhhh...limp and cold. And the fish on the inside joined them within minutes of hitting the table. The cilantro rice they serve with it tasted ok but that's about it. Just ok. They also gave me a little bowl of beans but I took two bites and left it alone. My fiancÃ©'s truffle honey chicken was incredibly bland though. The skin didn't taste like much, neither did the meat on the inside. Most of the flavor came from the sauce on the plate. His mashed potatoes were peppery af but with the chicken, it wasn't terrible. I'm not sure if the quality of the food decreased since the last time I had it but it definitely wasn't really something I'd be like ""dying to try"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia

Daniel M.,"Philadelphia, PA",45,97,269,1.0,2/3/2017,I came in here just to pick up cheesecake. The young lady at the counter was rude and never even made eye contact with me. It felt as if she didn't want to be there. If she's not happy with her job she should find another one. I went in on 02/03/17 around 10:00pm. I hope management reads this and fires her. The gentlemen who made the cake was nicer and was doing his job to the best of his ability. I'm spending $8.75 on a slice of cheesecake I would think I would get a thank you and have a good evening. The inside is nice and I'm sure other employees their are nice. The dessert area looked messy and the girl behind the counter just wasn't professional at all. I won't be returning to this location.

Jasmine A.,"Vancouver, Canada",162,276,823,2.0,11/23/2016,"Starving, we stopped at the Cheescake Factory for lunch. Â The Cheescake Factory isn't anything special--typical North American kind of dishes, such as pastas, burgers, etc, the type of food that hits the spot when you're hungry. There were plenty of tasty options, but looking through the menu, I was horrified. Â I knew the Cheesecake Factory isn't the best place to go if you're health conscious, but my god, the calorie content was absolutely horrific; most of their dishes were between 1500 to 2000 calories each, an entire day's worth of calories. Â Ugh. Â Thank goodness they had a ""skinny"" menu which offered lower calorie dishes, around 600 calories each. Off the skinny menu, I ordered the enchiladas (I just couldn't order from the regular menu, knowing that I would be consuming 1800 calories in one sitting). Â I still don't quite believe that they were ""only"" 590 calories, as they were a full portion and extremely filling. Overall I am rating The Cheescake Factory only two stars because the food is just average, the calorie content horrifying, and the waiter was a bit condescending.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia

Please turn the dimmer up so there's some lighting. I like ambiance but there's a problem when you can barely see the food in front of you. Table and silverware was unkempt. For some reason, there were still cloth napkins from the previous party before us on the ground. Server was solid. Seemed like they were understaffed this night because he did not appear until we were 10 minutes into looking at the menu. Hostess did not set up smaller plates to share.

We were given a menu and then asked about drinks, I got the Peach Smoothie and my friends got water with lemon(the waiter was really chill about it; some waiters might get irritated with extra work of lemon).  We started with appetizers which was nachos, cheese covered with something(sorry forgot) and BBQ chicken.  The nachos was BIG that 4 of us could not even finish. ONLY get the nachos if you're super hungry and have a big group of people. The cheese cover was very rich and cheesy. The BBQ chicken was cooked just right and my friend finished that all! The meals came and I got the lunch special of sausage and shrimp pasta. The sausage and shrimp was AMAZING and pasta sauce tasted so fresh!! The peach drink tasted organic and very fresh but I still prefer their Mango Iced Tea but I'm trying to taste all their drinks. My friend got a burger and he asked for cheese on it, in which was not given to us at first but the waiter remembered as she brought it over and went back into the kitchen which shows she has great instinct and memorization, I guess... but the waiter was really good with coming to us regularly and not too much, refilling our bread, and even enjoying some laughs with us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=20

Skyla C.,"Philadelphia, PA",64,156,1570,2.0,12/26/2016,Cheesecake factory has been around for the longest but we decided to dine in tonight because the waiting line at max brenner was just too crazy . I first had cheesecake factory when it was opened years ago back at home in Boston. I never really liked the food there . 5 stars goes towards their cheesecakes though. So we decided to give cheesecake factory a second chance.  When we first walked in hostess greeted us but gave us a weird look instead of a smile . Points off there . And then told us there's about 15 to 20 mins wait and we said okay that's fine. She didn't lock us in the computer at first until another Â group came in after us and see us just standing there. We then was given a number beeper and told we could go right ahead upstairs . Surprising the wait wasn't long . So that was good . Took us a bit to look over the menu because there was a variety to choose from. So our waitress came and took our orders for drinks and apps . We decided to get buffalo Blast and dynamite shrimp for appetizers (as pictured) . The Buffalo blast was good . The dynamite shrimp was okay. It could use a little more flavor . For entrÃ©e I decided to go with the chicken marsala and my boyfriend got the meatloaf. When the drink came she only brought my boyfriend drink and told me my drink will be out shortly. I thoughts all the drinks supposed to come out at the same time and not just one and while the other wait for theirs . But okay. The first appetizer came out which was the Buffalo blast half way eating it my drink still hasn't come yet and I was thirsty after a few bites . My drink didn't come out until my entrÃ©e came out which was probably 20 mins after . Sign of bad service because the couple next to us ordered drinks and all their drinks came out right away by a different waitress . After a few bites of our food we was ready to leave because my boyfriend didn't like how his food taste and my chicken marsala was sweet and the sauce tasted burnt while I was eating it . I didn't want to make a big deal out of it so we just asked the waitress to packed the food to go . I should of just stick to my instance and went elsewhere because the food hasn't meet our expectations . I won't return to dine in but definitely for the cheesecakes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=20
Renea R.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,218,2,4.0,6/19/2017,"My friend, Naomi (also known as BB or Birthday Bitch), invited a group of around 10 friends to the Cheesecake Factory for a celebration of her being born. Â I had been to the King of Prussia CF but never to the downtown location. Â The CF is always a bit of an odyssey into another world, where people have expendable cash and suburban hairstyles and where decadence is supremely exalted, in both garish displays of dÃ©cor and overall gluttony. Â In this way, the Cheesecake Factory is a quite viscerally American experience. While waiting at the bar I chatted with my buddy, Hawkeye, and spent $10 on a bottled Angry Orchard. Â Cocktails were in the double digit range, and seeing how I was a poor social worker masquerading as a person who can afford to eat at fancy restaurants, I opted to not get any more alcoholic drinks throughout my stay. Eventually we were moved to a large table that could accommodate our group. Â Our server was polite and attentive and tolerant of our low class requests, such as bringing me hot sauce to pair with the free bread they serve. Â Speaking of the free bread, it was delicious and regrettably I ate quite a lot of it despite having given up gluten recently. Communing with the other indigent social workers, Hawkeye and I decided to split some nachos with our friend Brenda. Â The calorie content was well over your overall daily allowance so it seemed that splitting it three ways would be wise. Â Getting swept up in the gluttony of this establishment, I impulsively decided to also order their ""Nashville Hot"" chicken nuggets which were only $5. Â They claimed to be quite hot, which I considered dubious but figured it was worth a try. When the nachos arrived, they were as enormous as we had hoped and had generous portions of good toppings including spicy chicken, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa. Â I wouldn't say that there was anything particularly ""special"" about these nachos, but they were large, filling, and tasty so I was very happy with this decision. Â They were also more than enough for three people and frankly I did not need my impulsive chicken nuggets. Â Speaking of the chicken nuggets, I found them very underwhelming. Â Only one chicken nugget out of ten was sufficiently saucy and the overall heat level was practically imperceptible. BB's new man friend, Landon (who worked hard all night to prove to us that he wasn't a Blandon) got the fried mac and cheese balls and generously shared with the table in what I can only imagine was a ploy to win good favor in the group. Â These were cheese-filled pillows of heaven and you could only hope to be so lucky as to get to experience them for free at some point in your lifetime. Â He also got a very mysterious dish which was a pizza made with chicken-parmesan crust and pasta on top. Â I didn't get to taste it but I can only imagine that it was quite indulgent. At the conclusion of the meal, a handful of the brave ordered cheesecake. Â Thanks to the plentiful free bread I was bloated up like a hot air balloon and had no money or appetite left for dessert but I admired those that were able to go ""all the way."" Â I have had CF Cheesecake before and it's incredibly delicious, probably as a result of each slice including over three quarters of your daily calorie content. In the end, what could be more wholesomely American than group of ten 20-something-year-olds (okay fine, I'm 30...) caucusing in the soft glow of ornate chandeliers of ostentation, eating a week's worth of calories in food they will have to buy on credit to afford, surrounded by suburban families ignoring everything but their iphones. Â BB seemed happy to usher in a new year of life in this manner and frankly I enjoyed myself and the food very much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=20
Casey P.,"Philadelphia, PA",39,147,22,3.0,8/1/2017,"Pretty basic. I liked our appetizers: Chicken samosas and shrimp rolls (Vietnamese style). You know, Cheesecake Factory has their standard items. My rating is pretty much for the service here. It was just slow. It appeared our waiter was stretched too thin, there were some times he was overattentive, but for a large portion of the meal (we were there for lunch), he was MIA. There were swaths of time where all of our dishes were on the table without being taken away for room, where we wanted more water, where we waited to order the food, waited for the check. It just was inconsistently timed the whole lunch.

Jackson C.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,35,6,3.0,10/28/2017,"This place is the good, the bad, and the ugly. The good of course was the cheesecake, I had some kind of caramel pecan cheesecake that was 5 stars for sure. The food was bad, my salad was wilted and extra chewy, my shrimp was medium well and I believe that shrimp and seafood should be thoroughly cooked. The ugly was our waiter, I forgot his name but he was awful each course came to the table at least 20 minutes apart, I even had to look for him to get silverware to eat our salads with because there was none on the table when we sat down and he did not bringing any out with our food.

Bhavika P.,"Philadelphia, PA",75,185,574,3.0,1/26/2017,Had a no calorie count kinda day today and I enjoyed it by having the delicious cheesecakes (while chocolate raspberry truffle being my fav of all).  Starters: Avocado egg rolls was yum specially the dip that comes with it just makes it perfect. I loved it. Nachos was alright.  Main course: bang bang chicken and shrimp. Was too sweet for me. I am not sure if it always supposed to take like that but I did not enjoy it at all due to the sweetness.  Dessert: Plain cheesecake and raspberry truffle.  Great place to go when you are a big group and everyone has a different cuisine in mind as this place serves almost everything right from eggs to desserts!! Low calorie and full of calorie!!  I took off 2 stars only because the service seemed slow even on a empty afternoon lunch hour. We were a big group (16) no doubt but I think we needed 2 people to take care than just 1. The server was really good no complains but taking care of so many people was too time consuming and there was a long break between the appetizers and main course.  The quantity of food is huge. Definitely value for money!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=20
Angela L.,"Merion Station, PA",273,66,236,2.0,6/18/2017,"I rarely ever complain about a restaurants service and kitchen staff; however, the dining experience at this specific Cheesecake Factory was absolutely awful. For starters, the waiter listened to our orders, didn't write them down and then proceeded to come back to the table and ask us for our orders again. The three of us dining all made modifications to our orders. When he brought out orders over, he did not take note of the modifications, resulting in us having to wait even longer for our food. Once our ""correct"" food came over, there was still food missing and the quality was not good. My mom ordered the grilled chicken tostado salad. The tostado was limp and soaked instead of crispy, and there was no chicken on the salad. I ordered the Tuscan chicken subbed with salmon which comes with artichokes but there were no artichokes, and the salmon portion was so small. I had gone to the King of Prussia location the night before which had a salmon filet double the size served at the Philadelphia location. The manager was nice enough to give me another portion of salmon but the overall quality of service and food was sub-par at best.

Christina L.,"Philadelphia, PA",236,7,15,4.0,7/31/2017,"Take the escalators up to the lively and spacious Cheesecake Factory located in the heart of Center City Philadelphia. Â This place is known for their inviting ambiance, and more importantly, Â the extensive variety of delicious cheesecakes they provide. Food: 3.5/5 - The cheesecakes are without a doubt their signature desserts. Â Rich, sweet, and absolutely fulfilling, these pieces (running from 6-8 dollars a piece) will have you wondering what flavor you should get on your next visit. Â Their main dishes are not as impressionable and tend to be over-seasoned. Â Many of their dishes consist of pasta, sandwiches, and other familiar American favorites (roasted chicken, tacos, etc). Â The cheesecake alone gets a 4.5/5 rating in my book; however, the other options do not measure up. Service: 3/5 - The waiters and waitresses are friendly but tend to get lost during peak dining hours. Â No matter what request you have, they are extremely happy and willing to fulfill your request.... it may just take some time to get your check or that extra straw you needed five minutes ago. Ambiance: 3.5/5 - Like any other Cheesecake Factory, this location is spacious and has a high-ceiling providing a nice break from the usual Philadelphian restaurant scene. Â The warm colored interior invites birthday parties to the casual diners. Â  Value: 4/5 - For a restaurant chain, the prices tend to be on the higher end. Â However, these prices are justified by their huge portions. Â They are much greater than your typical restaurants (especially in for being in the city). Â More often then not, you will be coming out quite full and taking home the leftovers. OVERALL RATING: 3.5/5 Personal Recommendation: For the best Cheesecake Factory experience, I recommend coming here just for the cheesecakes. Â Expecting or looking for more will probably leave you a bit unsatisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=20

We walked a couple blocks over, took the elevator upstairs and were greeted by a hangry mob. Well, basically. It was midday on a Saturday and this place was bursting at the seams with people waiting for tables. Originally we planned to eat-in until we heard about the crazy wait time. No thanks. Fortunately, they do have a to-go counter. While the process of ordering was a bit unorganized and the staff unfriendly, we were able to snag our cheesecake slices and leave within about 10 minutes. I ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough, and it was pretty darn good. I don't want to consider the calorie count on that thing...but if you're in the mood for an extra sweet snack, you could very well visit this accessible spot. Of course, there's also the option of stopping in one of the local haunts, where you're likely to find stellar fare at better prices.

We called ahead to see if it would be an issue with us coming at midnight and the person whom we spoke to said that it was no problem. Once we got seated our server immediately started rushing us to order our food. He also told us that he had been there all day and they were so busy that they didn't have anymore bread( that was ok). Throughout the entire experience we were rushed and the server was trying to get us out of there so quickly he forget a few things that we asked for.

Mike F.,"Reading, PA",86,146,351,3.0,11/5/2015,"Whenever I think of the Cheesecake Factory, Vince Young always comes to mind. As his dumpster fire of an NFL career was coming to an end circa 2012, reports began to surface that the former Eagles QB and third overall pick of the 2006 NFL draft was known to spend upwards of $5,000 per week at the Cheesecake Factory. I know NFL players enjoy the lavish lifestyle, but come on, $5,000 per week at the CHEESECAKE FACTORY? You're a millionaire. Treat yourself. That's like if I went out tonight and spent $200 at Taco Bell (I've come close).  Sources now say Vince Young is now working at an undisclosed Cheesecake Factory location as a short order line cook. Get 'em, Vince! This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. Not sure how I was able to avoid them for this long. You know, there's a lot to like about this place. The dining room is pretty darn impressive. Lots of head room.  Pressed for time, my buddies and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table. Service was friendly, though not the most attentive. As a fairly outgoing group, we were able to get the attention of the bartenders. But I noticed a lot of quiet couples around us being completely neglected. This was actually making ME feel a little awkward, so I made it a point to tell the bartender not to focus solely on my group and to help the other people standing around. Not sure why this was necessary ... you'd think they would do this on their own. Food portions are HUGE! Has anyone else ever ordered the chicken fingers here? You seriously get like two pounds of chicken and another half pound of mashed potatoes. Seriously. It's obscene. In a good way, of course. Would I come back? Sure.

The drink my partner ordered took about 20 minutes to show up.  Our main dishes were the truffle honey chicken which had good flavor but was 90% breading and the bang bang chicken and shrimp for which my partner asked for extra sauce and received only when his dish was half gone, and then it was the wrong sauce.  Our waiter (Daveanghn) made little attempt to explain or correct any of the wait times or errors. While they were busy, he only had 4 or 5 tables in our section, so we were baffled by the lack of service.

Jess J.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",150,204,509,4.0,3/21/2016,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon with a fairly big party of mainly teenage girls. They were done rehearsals and gearing up for a performance in a few hours. Cheesecake Factory with their large menu and portions is a good pick because everyone can find something they like... Since it was lunch time we could order the lunch portions and go easy on the pockets.  I'd never been to this location.. So one thing I will say is coming in and seeing the hostess stand on the first floor with no one standing there threw us off a bit, sent one of the girls up on the elevator and she ushered us to come up... As we rode up, we saw the hustle a bustle that is Cheesecake Factory. They didn't at all seem annoyed or flustered when we told them party of 10... Within about 10 minutes we were seated. We had one waitress that took care of us.. I like that a lot better than having 2 for either side of the table, and she did an awesome job keeping everything straight. We all pretty much knew what we wanted since we needed time for food to digest and settle prior to show time that was one of the requirements, lol know what u want and no dessert. I hated the no dessert rule after all it was Cheesecake Factory, but hey the food was filling.  I ordered the salmon off of the gluten free menu, swapped the broccoli for asparagus, so glad I made that choice, I must say some of the best asparagus I've had in a long time. The meal as a whole was considerably better than any of the cheesecake factory's I have been to. There is one 5 minutes from me that I usually end up at, but this one put them to shame. I'm definitely a fan, I usually end up here for convenience rather than choice, but this location is awesome. There was a slight mishap where when two of the girls ordered pasta with red sauce they were asked if they wanted tomatoes, so given the choice they said no, but it came out with tomatoes, when they questioned it, our waitress took it back but then came back saying that's just how it comes.. She apologized, knowing she had asked them, the girls were fine, pushed them to the side and still enjoyed the meal, overall it was a great meal, everyone enjoyed, it wasn't dragged out or we weren't rushed, it was a success!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=40

Salima C.,"Philadelphia, PA",282,103,54,1.0,6/23/2016,"I DESPISE chain restaurants. It's definitely not my first choice but on a pouring rainy day semi tired from work we settled on something quick and easy...so we thought.  Shrimp Alfredo- shrimp was dry and chewy, Alfredo pasta was season less, it's really hard to mess up a dish that's typically good if you just dump sauce on it but Cheesecake Factory center city found a way to make it bland and not very enjoyable. Filet mignon and cheese balls-wanted to swap out one of the sides that came w/ the steak for the cheese balls and simply add the extra cost  (if necessary) since cheese balls are $10 and the sides are $5. They made such a huge deal about it. I even suggested they comp the cheese balls just to accommodate us as paying customers and that was empathically denied. Our waiter Christian was kinda cool but had NO power or willingness. The manager Manny was incompetent and rigid. I even said to him, ""Manny you aren't very good at your job are you?"" Lol  They didn't bring a steak knife for my friend to eat the steak with. They ran out of Riesling and the their Mojito was gross, had to send it back and just got Gingerale which was $3.00 and NO refills.  The entire experience was blah and reminded me why I'm so picky about the places I choose to dine. Never again will I allow anyone to make me feel guilty for being a dining snob. I'll simply remind them of this experience and hopefully they get it...if not...ill be far away at Devon or Parc and I won't hear their judging.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=60

I have worked in the restaurant industry for James beard awarded chefs, French culinary chefs with notable companies such as the kimpton as a sommelier certified from the CMS or as a restaurant manager. I have a lot of latitude when it comes to service or food to a degree but this is the first time the cheesecake has let me down.

It has a great spot with views of the city which makes it a step above the average Cheesecake Factory at the mall. Overall the food is great. The menu can be overwhelming for some since it literally is a 20 page book, but it is filled with a great variety. There is literally something for everyone. There were plenty of vegetarians options, and portions are huge! Don't forget to save room for cheesecake though. Having tried at least 10 different cheesecakes they have, I have never been disappointed. Strangely they seated our party of 5 on a table for 4 and then seated a party of 2 in a large booth for 5/6 people. Maybe they are still working out things since they are still relatively new, but this was really inconvenient. Also, service can be slow since the waiters have lots of tables and literally have to run around to keep up.

Kirk S.,"Philadelphia, PA",6,13,30,5.0,8/26/2016,"I have written other reviews regarding the regular dining menu at TCF. this review is strictly about the happy hour menu offered between 4 and 6PM Monday thru Friday. I have gone once by myself around Five PM and it was very busy but my experience was very good. had to wait a bit for drinks sometimes but considering thre rush the delay was understandable. This time i went with a friend and we showed up right after Four PM. Big difference in the room. Not nearly as busy or loud. I'll just list the items that we ordered along with their happy hour price-Chicken Pot Stickers ($5.50), Crispy Crab Bites ($7.50,real crab meat), The Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip ($5.50-had two orders in house and my friend ordered one to go, that's how great the dip is. Intoxicating and addictive!), Dynamite Tempura Shrimp ($6.95-not as spicy as I had been led to think they would be but good flavor nonetheless. If you order the house wine, be it white, red, or zinfandel, (I had my usual Merlot) the price is $5.50. Name brand wines will cost more (Like my friend's Moscato @ $9.50). You can get beer for $3-4 and drinks such as Long Island Iced teas, mojitos, and margaritas for $5.50! There are so many appetizers that we didn't get to try this time nut are looking forward to on our next trip. The price is right and the earlier you come the better the service will be. After five it can get busy so things will take longer. Wanted to also mention our server Craig M. who answered our questions and, if didn't know the answer, he would go and find out. He was friendly and patient, even bringing us fresh, warm bread when the first basket came out cold and hard. Thanks Craig!  So, if you are looking to try The Cheesecake Menu without paying the regular prices, try their happy hour.

Shannon R.,"Philadelphia, PA",134,14,,2.0,7/26/2016,"This was my 1st time at this location. Â The building and atmosphere is gorgeous. Â Thankfully they have an elevator in addition to the escalators and steps. Â I was with a rather large group of people, and we were able to be seated in a private room with a wonderful view of Philadelphia. Â This was good and bad. Â Why? Â As it got darker outside, the dimmer the lights became on the inside, to the point where we were all pulling out our cellphones to use the lights to read our menus!  For my drink, I ordered a glass of Moscato. Â Unfortunately they were out of it. :( Â So, I ordered a glass of Riesling. Â It was pretty good. Â The only thing i didn't like was the fact that the wine glasses were so large, yet they only filled it up halfway! Â I guess that's to make you order another glass. Â Who knows. Â Needless to say, for $9.50, that was my only glass of wine for the night. Â Grade: B My appetizer was the Fried Zucchini. Â I asked for mine without cheese and marinara sauce instead of ranch dressing. Â I was looking forward to it, since this is one of my favorite appetizers in the world, and everywhere I have gone either took it off of their menus or it has been absolutely horrendous! Â Well...The Cheesecake factory made me happy! Â Thick pieces of Zucchini sticks, light and crispy breading and wasn't served as a greasy mess! Â The people I shared them with agreed that they were very good. Â The portion was very large. Â I ended up ordering more to go with my main course. Â Grade: A+ My main course for dinner was Fish and Chips. Â Well. Â I can honestly say that I've had better in less-costing restaurants. Â The flsh was fried nice and crispy, but it was very bland. Â The fries were good. Â Grade: C Dessert: Â I ordered the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake for myself and the Godiva Cheesecake for my friend. Â Both were awesome, like always! Â Grade: A+ The only thing that I can completely say that I was truly upset about was the salad that I ordered to-go. Â It was the French Country Salad with mixed greens, grilled asparagus, fresh beets, goat cheese, candied pecans and vinaigrette. Â I was very disappointed when I got home and opened up the salad. Â Extremely wilted lettuce. Â There were only a couple pieces of beets and they looked dried out. Â We won't even talk about the asparagus. Â About 2 goat cheese crumbles. Â All I can say is that this was a major disappointment for the amount that it cost. Grade:D Overall, my experience with the food was ok. Â Our server, Anna, did a good job with serving a large group. Â The only issue I had was sending my check back for corrections. Â  Will I go back to this particular location? Â Not sure. Â We shall see. Â   Overall Grade: Â C",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=80

Amy B.,"Philadelphia, PA",80,342,25,4.0,12/7/2015,"I went here tonight with friends based on one of their recommendations and my inkling to want to try it out. We ate a table near the bar and had very friendly waitstaff who were quite accommodating but a little bit slow, the restaurant/bar area wasn't very crowded. Â We each had a beverage and a skinny-liscious appetizer. Â It took awhile for the food to arrive, I had a trio of lettuce wrapped tacos which were messy but very good. One friend enjoyed his flatbread pizza which sounded and looked delish, my other friend enjoyed her app but part of it wasn't great, I tried it and wasn't impressed. Â All in all it was a fun evening, the music and ambiance was nice. $49 for 3 apps, 1 drink, 1 soft drink seems a little steep to me.

Cam M.,"Southern Pines, NC",4,14,1,1.0,10/4/2015,"WORST BRUNCH EVER! If only zero stars were an option. My wife and I decided to give CCF a try for brunch today. As we came in the door there was no one greeting at the bottom of the escalator. So we ventured up to the restaurant and we were seated right away on the patio. The server was just straight preoccupied. As it took so long that we gave our drink order and food order at the same time. When he returned with our drinks my wife's tea cup was filthy. When the server returned he immediately said ""oh I forgot to tell you, we're out of French toast."" Â The restaurant serves so much bread how are they out of toast. Maybe they are out of eggs? We ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes as a replacement. Â  While waiting for our food we noticed our server serving bread to other tables. So we asked can we have some bread. Â ""Oh ya I forgot"". Â Our food came out before he returned with the bread. My dish was supposed to come with toasted bread. ""Oh sorry they burned it I will bring some out."" My crab Benedict was fine one of the eggs was over cooked. My wife's pancakes that we're supposed to be lemon ricotta were just plain pancakes. Â When I complained to the server. He said the lemon ricotta was inside. Â  Well folks I cut a bite out of the center of each pancake and the lemon ricotta was lie, none found. I complained again. ""I'll let my manager know"". Â When he returned he told me his manager took our drinks off the bill. Â I know this trick, he didn't talk to anyone he just hadn't added our drinks to the bill yet. Fine, I'm not looking for a free meal. I just want it to be done and served correctly. So we asked for some syrup for our plain pancakes. We were told they don't have any except for the melted butter they served with the pancakes.... Â Thus my wife's pancakes were now non edible. Â  Our server then told us that the Cheesecake Factory doesn't do brunch well at all and that we should have come for lunch or dinner instead. Way to talk about your own restaurant! Why even offering a brunch menu if you aren't going to offer it correctly? Safe to say this will be my first and last visit to the tourist factory there are way to many good restaurants in Philly to waste your time in a non-customer oriented atmosphere.

Rizwan A.,"Philadelphia, PA",82,199,32,1.0,9/17/2015,"Avoid. This is unfortunately the poorest rendition of the cheesecake factory that I've ever been to. Seeing as how they are the best restaurant in the world normally, I even tried this particular location twice, but each time was just as awful. As an avid cheesecake factory enthusiast, I have to give this location 0 stars, even the pre-made, frozen cheesecake could not be prepared properly by the staff.  The first time I ate here, my entree came with the wrong type of chicken, which I didnt' care about but it was just mistake number 1 of what, ten? I lost count. The waiters here disappear. You can even get up and go look for them but unless you know where the secret time warp portal is located you'll have zero luck entering their dimension to ask for something. I disliked that I had to ask for a refill, ask for a napkin, ask for a straw, ask for a box, ask for an actual box, ask for a normal sized box rather than the 10'' by 10'' box for my leftover cheesecake, and then also have to ask for a bag.  I didn't like how the cheesecake was served warm and melting, without whipped creme, and without any acknowledgement.  I didn't like waiting for over 45 minutes for my food.

The food wasn't quite as good as King of Prussia but they're new so I was willing to write that off because they're still new. Â So I got five star service and four star food, Â so why a three star review?  I've been going out to dinner for over three decades and have never experienced anything like this. Â I also have a pretty good sense of humor and am generally hard to offend. Â All that being said, Â onto the story.  While eating at the bar a server came up and asked me, Â who won the superbowl three years ago. Â I told her I didn't know but I could Google it, she then began to berate me for not knowing and walked away. I just shrugged and went back to eating.  Three minutes later, Â she asked and I quote ""Where would you most likely wake up with a finger in your ass"". I had absolutely nothing, Â wasn't even sure how to reply to that. Then I was treated to stories about how she came to work high everyday and what drugs she uses etc... AND SHE KEPT COMING BACK!!!!! I don't know if she was high then or if she thought she was funny, Â but I hurried up to finish my food and get out because it was just uncomfortable. Â Worse part, they don't wear name tags so I can't tell you who she was. If the powers that be are reading this: she was the VERY obnoxious server working 8/25/15 @ 9pm.

At that point they said we were one of the next tables. Well 30 mins later we will were not called. We went up to complain and were told they were cleaning our table. 15 mins later we finally got seated. Total wait time was 1 HR 40 mins which is pretty ridiculous considering that when we got seated there were 4 large clean empty tables around us.  The server was prompt and polite. I had no problems with him. We put our order in immediately with our drink orders. We got our bread and it was not warm and was very hard on the outside. When the runners brought out our entrees they only brought 2 of the 5 out. 5 mins later (yes I actually monitored the time) the other 3 entrees came out. 2 of the entrees were wrong. My husband ordered spaghetti and received a sandwich and I ordered a burger and received a piece of meat on hard bread, nothing else was on the burger. I told the waiter and he apologized. I told the waiter to take back my incorrect food and that I did not want my food replaced so just take it off the bill which he did. They brought my husbands correct entree, but at that point everyone else at the table was already done.  By the end we were annoyed and just ordered the strawberry shortcake to share. The ice cream was good but the biscuit was very hard and inedible.  Definitely will not be returning!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=100

As soon as we walked in (myself,a friend and my daughter) the host was in the back so she came about 5 mins which wasn't bad but she had attitude and didn't give her a kids menu. Okay! fine not a big deal, but as we're walking almost every table we passed was dirty! I mean DISGUSTING, while the waitresses and waiters was talking with each other. We sit down and the host begins to give her silverware(DIRTY SILVERWARE) we expressed we wanted plastic BC the silverware was so dirty her respond was to one talk to our waiter about that and two put the DIRTY( I mean food still on the fork dirty) back into the draw to give to other customers! (red flag) next I ordered a glass of Merlot .. I should've took a picture of my glass but it was so dirty my friend took it back to the bar BC it was greasy like someone literally just had a drink and they washed it with water and poured my wine in there. My friend took the wine back, spoke with the manager about how dirty the restaurant was, instead of him bringing the wine back asking did we need anything or just see how dirty the place was he sent a waiter. Now, someone comes and looks at the silverware ( not a Mgr) and begins to wipe he DIRTY silverware with a cloth .. A CLOTH! Not rewash them but a cloth! DISGUSTING! Â On top of everything, the waiters , omg their clothes were gross like they were in the back cooking the food themselves! Yes it was bad. Next to us was a set up where they came the dirty dishes (I guess and ice tea along with a register when everything was gross. I'm also attaching photos BC just expressing it isn't enough. So, all of this honestly probably happened within 15-20 mins tops. We got up walked over to the mgr.which is never came back to make sure i even Â received my wine and his respond was l'm embarrassed this place looks like this but I'm just coming in and trying to fix it , we expressed when trying to fix it first you need to rewash your dishes NOT wipe with a cloth! Also, as we are getting up from our table we were expressing it to another waiter with how dirty the place was and HE AGREED! Saying yeah I understand you guys are totally right it's dirty in here I'm sorry you guys had to come in and witness but we were confused BC everyone was standing around literally doing nothing while tables were still dirty ! I will never eat downtown Philly or even a drink at the Cheesecake Factory! My experience was horrible! I would not recommend anyone eating downtown Cheesecake Factory unless you want to get sick BC they don't clean anything! I have NEVER experienced anything like this before!

Sing L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,11,,2.0,10/4/2015,"I have been to only 2 locations for The Cheesecake Factory. This one and the one in KoP. I was amazed by how good the food was when I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience at KoP, so I was thrilled to find out they were opening one up in center city.  I went a couple days after they opened and I was fairly upset with the quality. The pasta was just not as good and the hibachi steak was not as flavorful. The mashed potatoes had huge chunks in it, which kind of ruined that. I figured, they just opened up so maybe they will get better with time. Went there a second time hoping for a better experience but my hopes were shot down. The service was a little worse, which was already a bad start. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta this time and it was not as great as I was hoping. The pasta was decent but the chicken was incredibly bland. My girlfriend got the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo which is a let down. The shrimp was burnt and the steak was too salty. The mashed potatoes once again had huge chunks. Is it that hard to make proper mashed potatoes? We left that night with a Kahlua cheesecake to go because we had to get out of there. I don't know whether it's the thought of that Cheesecake Factory being a disappointment compared to the one at KoP that made the cheesecake a little worse or the fact that it was actually worse. Nevertheless, if you want Cheesecake Factory, take the drive and go to the one at KoP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=100

The nightmare began when our waiter first approached the table to greet us and asked us if we had any questions about the menu, after waiting and waiting, he brought out only three waters.. when there was clearly four of us. We proceeded to place our orders, and after patiently waiting for our food and breadsticks, nothing. We called over the waiter and asked ""hi may we have our breadsticks?"" he replies, ""oh, you want breadsticks? sure"". We were very disappointed at the fact that we may have never received breadsticks if we had never asked. Not to mention, we finished our waters and had to sit around waiting for the waiter that never came to check up on our table. If we wanted more water, we had to wave over our server. So finally, our pasta dishes and pizza arrive at the table. It looks absolutely delicious, as always; however, the server did not bring out cheese.

Upon our arrival, one of my co-workers saw a roach on the floor, we thought that might have been a single incident until after being seated at our table; we placed our orders, was engaged in discussion at which point one of my co-workers saw another roach on the back of my seat, after some bewilderment, we get up, while another of my co-workers kill the roach; the manager comes over and offers us a seat in another location, we say fine; until while standing waiting to be seated we see yet another roach crawling on another seat. The manager acknowledged that there had just been extermination. At that point we all opted to leave the establishment as none of us had much of an appetite after that incident. I highly recommend that extermination be done after hours and allow enough time so that bugs such as roaches be totally eliminated before the establishment reopens. Unfortunately, I will not be back to that particular Cheesecake Factory and will probably be suspicious of others.

My first experience at this restaurant wasn't that good, but I decided to give it a second chance. The staff told us to wait 40 minutes so we did. They made us sit at ""the end of the bar"" which was two seats at a lower counter, so the barman barely saw us. Nobody came to give us a menu so we had to take one by ourselves. Nobody came to take our order for 15mn until we finally ask for someone. They didn't gave us water nor bread automatically, we had to ask for it. Every time. Even for forks, knives and napkins. Â We wanted to change our seats because the counter was next to the restroom so many people were walking behind us. They gave us a ""beeper"" saying that we will have a table in 20mn. 20 mn later, an other woman was working at the front desk and she told me with in a condescending and annoyed way that I can't transfer from a table to another. Also the waiter didn't take our order correctly so we had to wait 35 mn total to finally have our food. I got the meatball pasta, which was really tasteless, my friend had the Miso Salmon, which wasn't bad. At the beginning we wanted some desert but we though that this place didn't deserved our money. This place looks nice and fancy at first but we realized fast enough that it is just a popular and overrated garbage.

She was accommodating until she gave us the checks, we gave her out cards and then when we got the receipts the amount had changed on out of our checks from originally 35 to 42!! How the hell does that happen? Please explain how you randomly add 2 sodas to a check that was already correct before we gave you out cards. Then she wanted to know If that extra was ok or does she need to get her manager... Um yes get your manager.. Then she returned with 6$ in cash Â without the manager...

I am not a stranger to fine dining and have been to several of the top restaurants not only in Philly but around the world so it is not like I have unsophisticated tastes or an unsophisticated palette and I can certainly recognize good service from poor service. I have only been to this restaurant once but what is not to like? Â The venue is stunning and the location is superb. Â The tables are set far apart from each other and the ceilings are very high making it easy to catch up with friends and loved ones in a seemingly private and quiet setting. Â I found all of the wait staff to be very friendly and accommodating and there are tons of delicious and inexpensively priced items to choose from on the menu. Â I appreciate that they offered a skinny menu and found the chopped salad on that menu to be amazing. At $12 I had it for dinner and for lunch the next day. Â My friend and I started with the tuna carapacio which was wonderful and we also enjoyed our cocktails.

The service was terrible, the hostesses were unfriendly and downright incompetent. Our server wasn't rude but definitely not very friendly and took forever to get us our round of drinks when it was mostly empty in the rest of the restaurant. Some of our table resorted to going up to the bar for their drinks, it was just so ridiculous. The general attitude is come in, spend a ridiculous amount of money for subpar food and it's ok because it's Cheesecake Factory.

The appetizer came out in decent time and the food quickly followed but we maybe saw our waitress once at this point and I asked to order a sparkling water and she said sure I'll bring it right out. 20 mins later still no drink, I had to ask another waiter to get it for me.

After this last time in the city, I will never EVER return! Servers are absolutely incompetent, lazy, careless, and snobs. Managers are WORTHLESS! Do not go there unless you want to treated like garbage. Take your business to Cherry Hill , KOP or any other restaurant in the city.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=160

We were a party of 7 and she told us the entire restaurant was full and there were no tables available (although there was no one waiting to be seated). Â I found this concept hard to believe so I walked the floor of the restaurant and found a table that was available to accommodate us but it needed to be cleaned. I let the hostess know and she said she knew b/c they took an inventory (not sure why she didn't take inventory before telling us there were no seats). We waited another five minutes and then we were seated. Now we get the waitress who doesn't want to smile or acknowledge us. Smh. No pleasantries, no bread, took forever with the drinks, never apologized for any of the mishaps, and just outright rude. Stay clear of the Cheesecake Factory! Â The food and service sucks!

Nicole S.,"Silver Spring, MD",4,10,,3.0,10/10/2015,For a Saturday night we were started pretty quickly. Service was good and the food was fine. The cheesecake however was HORRIBLE. When the waitress came over I commented how tiny the slice was. It used to be enough to share but this piece was pretty much smaller than the two dollops of whipped cream. I ended up being happy that the piece was so small because it tasted really bad. The cheesecake part dry and crumbly.

The waitress, Kendra was curt and neglectful. It took my friends 20 minutes just to get the sauces they had asked for when they originally ordered. It did not end there however, Kendra then LOST my credit card when we paid. Â Instead of trying to locate it, she continued with what she was doing. I asked for the manager, Peter who was just as if not more apathetic. ""Yeah..uh sorry, can't find it."" I told him this was ridiculous and his only response was ""well we won't charge you for the drink"". Well obviously not because I no longer have a credit card.

We were then seated after about an hour and a half wait, but when we arrived at our table there were only 11 seats and even those were crammed together. We asked management if we could have another table added to the two that were already pushed together and the staff made it seem as though it was too difficult of a task to be done, so we began to move the tables ourselves until finally one of the employees saw and politely moved them for us. The hostess we had, who never mentioned her name throughout the entire meal, had the worst customer service I have ever seen. She asked if we would like drinks but only took drink orders for 5 of the guests. When asked about one of the drinks on the menu, the waitress seemed clueless. After we finished our appetizers, our meals began to come out, but our waitress did not take any of our finished dishes from the table in order to make room. After our meals, our waitress did not even ask if we would like to have any left overs wrapped to go or if we would like dessert, even after two guests ordered cheesecake.

As his dumpster fire of an NFL career was coming to an end circa 2012, reports began to surface that the former Eagles QB and third overall pick of the 2006 NFL draft was known to spend upwards of $5,000 per week at the Cheesecake Factory. I know NFL players enjoy the lavish lifestyle, but come on, $5,000 per week at the CHEESECAKE FACTORY? You're a millionaire. Treat yourself.

Get 'em, Vince! This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. Not sure how I was able to avoid them for this long. You know, there's a lot to like about this place. The dining room is pretty darn impressive. Lots of head room.  Pressed for time, my buddies and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table. Service was friendly, though not the most attentive. As a fairly outgoing group, we were able to get the attention of the bartenders. But I noticed a lot of quiet couples around us being completely neglected. This was actually making ME feel a little awkward, so I made it a point to tell the bartender not to focus solely on my group and to help the other people standing around. Not sure why this was necessary ... you'd think they would do this on their own. Food portions are HUGE! Has anyone else ever ordered the chicken fingers here? You seriously get like two pounds of chicken and another half pound of mashed potatoes. Seriously. It's obscene. In a good way, of course. Would I come back? Sure.

The portions were huge as well. If you're an average eater, one entree is good enough for two.  Four of us had 1 appetizer and 3 entrÃ©es, 2 cheesecakes and 1 ice cream. The bill came up to 100. Just to let you know. Service was great, though food came a little slow. Still. Food was food. No complaints.  Orders:  Calamari - was salty, though with a nice crisp. Still not worth it Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - distinct Thai flavor with pineapple. Great great dish if you love Thai.  Steak Diane - amazing. Very well done. Had a medium rare. Mushrooms were perfect.  Some sort of deep fried chicken pasta - very average, even possibly below average.  Smores cheesecake - Fantastic, if you love Smores or chocolate. Red velvet - average, nothing outstanding Hot fudge sundae - below average, was meh.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=40

Although cheesecake is in the name, I would say the sundaes are a slightly better dessert option on the menu! I have never been disappointed in a cheesecake from here but I have also never been stuffed. If you want to have a large dessert to share, I would suggest the hot fudge or rocky road sundae. It's large enough for 2-3 people and if you ask for no whipped cream I'm almost positive you get more ice cream haha.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=40
Jason C.,"Philadelphia, United States",251,43,10,1.0,24/2/2017,"Date night. Normally we love cheesecake factory but everything that could go wrong with this trip did.  It starts with not being brought water for the longest, then we didn't get our order taken for a very long time.  We started our order with the Buffalo Blast appetizer, which NEVER came. The drink my partner ordered took about 20 minutes to show up.  Our main dishes were the truffle honey chicken which had good flavor but was 90% breading and the bang bang chicken and shrimp for which my partner asked for extra sauce and received only when his dish was half gone, and then it was the wrong sauce.  Our waiter (Daveanghn) made little attempt to explain or correct any of the wait times or errors. While they were busy, he only had 4 or 5 tables in our section, so we were baffled by the lack of service.  This coupled with a few questionable lunch experiences (my office is right near the walnut st location) probably means we won't be returning to this location.

Jess J.,"Cherry Hill, United States",150,204,511,4.0,21/3/2016,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon with a fairly big party of mainly teenage girls. They were done rehearsals and gearing up for a performance in a few hours. Cheesecake Factory with their large menu and portions is a good pick because everyone can find something they like... Since it was lunch time we could order the lunch portions and go easy on the pockets.  I'd never been to this location.. So one thing I will say is coming in and seeing the hostess stand on the first floor with no one standing there threw us off a bit, sent one of the girls up on the elevator and she ushered us to come up... As we rode up, we saw the hustle a bustle that is Cheesecake Factory. They didn't at all seem annoyed or flustered when we told them party of 10... Within about 10 minutes we were seated. We had one waitress that took care of us.. I like that a lot better than having 2 for either side of the table, and she did an awesome job keeping everything straight. We all pretty much knew what we wanted since we needed time for food to digest and settle prior to show time that was one of the requirements, lol know what u want and no dessert. I hated the no dessert rule after all it was Cheesecake Factory, but hey the food was filling.  I ordered the salmon off of the gluten free menu, swapped the broccoli for asparagus, so glad I made that choice, I must say some of the best asparagus I've had in a long time. The meal as a whole was considerably better than any of the cheesecake factory's I have been to. There is one 5 minutes from me that I usually end up at, but this one put them to shame. I'm definitely a fan, I usually end up here for convenience rather than choice, but this location is awesome. There was a slight mishap where when two of the girls ordered pasta with red sauce they were asked if they wanted tomatoes, so given the choice they said no, but it came out with tomatoes, when they questioned it, our waitress took it back but then came back saying that's just how it comes.. She apologized, knowing she had asked them, the girls were fine, pushed them to the side and still enjoyed the meal, overall it was a great meal, everyone enjoyed, it wasn't dragged out or we weren't rushed, it was a success!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=40

My husband medium and other coworker was both well done. My coworker didn't mind but we had to send my husband steak back. There is no way I'm paying $30 for a steak not done the way I want it. My medium rare, came medium, no pink at all. It was late, around 12am, if it was any other time I would definitely send all four plates back to the kitchen. They need to hire new cooks or train their staff better on how to prepare steak.

Shrimp Alfredo- shrimp was dry and chewy, Alfredo pasta was season less, it's really hard to mess up a dish that's typically good if you just dump sauce on it but Cheesecake Factory center city found a way to make it bland and not very enjoyable. Filet mignon and cheese balls-wanted to swap out one of the sides that came w/ the steak for the cheese balls and simply add the extra cost  (if necessary) since cheese balls are $10 and the sides are $5. They made such a huge deal about it. I even suggested they comp the cheese balls just to accommodate us as paying customers and that was empathically denied.

Amy B.,"Philadelphia, United States",80,342,25,4.0,7/12/2015,"I went here tonight with friends based on one of their recommendations and my inkling to want to try it out. We ate a table near the bar and had very friendly waitstaff who were quite accommodating but a little bit slow, the restaurant/bar area wasn't very crowded. Â We each had a beverage and a skinny-liscious appetizer. Â It took awhile for the food to arrive, I had a trio of lettuce wrapped tacos which were messy but very good. One friend enjoyed his flatbread pizza which sounded and looked delish, my other friend enjoyed her app but part of it wasn't great, I tried it and wasn't impressed. Â All in all it was a fun evening, the music and ambiance was nice. $49 for 3 apps, 1 drink, 1 soft drink seems a little steep to me.

Cam M.,"Southern Pines, United States",4,14,1,1.0,4/10/2015,"WORST BRUNCH EVER! If only zero stars were an option. My wife and I decided to give CCF a try for brunch today. As we came in the door there was no one greeting at the bottom of the escalator. So we ventured up to the restaurant and we were seated right away on the patio. The server was just straight preoccupied. As it took so long that we gave our drink order and food order at the same time. When he returned with our drinks my wife's tea cup was filthy. When the server returned he immediately said ""oh I forgot to tell you, we're out of French toast."" Â The restaurant serves so much bread how are they out of toast. Maybe they are out of eggs? We ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes as a replacement. Â  While waiting for our food we noticed our server serving bread to other tables. So we asked can we have some bread. Â ""Oh ya I forgot"". Â Our food came out before he returned with the bread. My dish was supposed to come with toasted bread. ""Oh sorry they burned it I will bring some out."" My crab Benedict was fine one of the eggs was over cooked. My wife's pancakes that we're supposed to be lemon ricotta were just plain pancakes. Â When I complained to the server. He said the lemon ricotta was inside. Â  Well folks I cut a bite out of the center of each pancake and the lemon ricotta was lie, none found. I complained again. ""I'll let my manager know"". Â When he returned he told me his manager took our drinks off the bill. Â I know this trick, he didn't talk to anyone he just hadn't added our drinks to the bill yet. Fine, I'm not looking for a free meal. I just want it to be done and served correctly. So we asked for some syrup for our plain pancakes. We were told they don't have any except for the melted butter they served with the pancakes.... Â Thus my wife's pancakes were now non edible. Â  Our server then told us that the Cheesecake Factory doesn't do brunch well at all and that we should have come for lunch or dinner instead. Way to talk about your own restaurant! Why even offering a brunch menu if you aren't going to offer it correctly? Safe to say this will be my first and last visit to the tourist factory there are way to many good restaurants in Philly to waste your time in a non-customer oriented atmosphere.

Rizwan A.,"Philadelphia, United States",82,199,32,1.0,17/9/2015,"Avoid. This is unfortunately the poorest rendition of the cheesecake factory that I've ever been to. Seeing as how they are the best restaurant in the world normally, I even tried this particular location twice, but each time was just as awful. As an avid cheesecake factory enthusiast, I have to give this location 0 stars, even the pre-made, frozen cheesecake could not be prepared properly by the staff.  The first time I ate here, my entree came with the wrong type of chicken, which I didnt' care about but it was just mistake number 1 of what, ten? I lost count. The waiters here disappear. You can even get up and go look for them but unless you know where the secret time warp portal is located you'll have zero luck entering their dimension to ask for something. I disliked that I had to ask for a refill, ask for a napkin, ask for a straw, ask for a box, ask for an actual box, ask for a normal sized box rather than the 10'' by 10'' box for my leftover cheesecake, and then also have to ask for a bag.  I didn't like how the cheesecake was served warm and melting, without whipped creme, and without any acknowledgement.  I didn't like waiting for over 45 minutes for my food. Will not be back, the KoP will have to do.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=100
Miliardo P.,"Philadelphia, United States",13,108,3,3.0,1/9/2015,"Ok, this is weird! I had pretty good food and fantastic service at the bar. The food wasn't quite as good as King of Prussia but they're new so I was willing to write that off because they're still new. Â So I got five star service and four star food, Â so why a three star review?  I've been going out to dinner for over three decades and have never experienced anything like this. Â I also have a pretty good sense of humor and am generally hard to offend. Â All that being said, Â onto the story.  While eating at the bar a server came up and asked me, Â who won the superbowl three years ago. Â I told her I didn't know but I could Google it, she then began to berate me for not knowing and walked away. I just shrugged and went back to eating.  Three minutes later, Â she asked and I quote ""Where would you most likely wake up with a finger in your ass"". I had absolutely nothing, Â wasn't even sure how to reply to that. Then I was treated to stories about how she came to work high everyday and what drugs she uses etc... AND SHE KEPT COMING BACK!!!!! I don't know if she was high then or if she thought she was funny, Â but I hurried up to finish my food and get out because it was just uncomfortable. Â Worse part, they don't wear name tags so I can't tell you who she was. If the powers that be are reading this: she was the VERY obnoxious server working 8/25/15 @ 9pm.

Meg W.,"Evesham Township, United States",28,2,,1.0,20/12/2015,"Will not eat at this location again. Started with them telling us an hour wait. So we put in our name and came back 55mins later. At that point they said we were one of the next tables. Well 30 mins later we will were not called. We went up to complain and were told they were cleaning our table. 15 mins later we finally got seated. Total wait time was 1 HR 40 mins which is pretty ridiculous considering that when we got seated there were 4 large clean empty tables around us.  The server was prompt and polite. I had no problems with him. We put our order in immediately with our drink orders. We got our bread and it was not warm and was very hard on the outside. When the runners brought out our entrees they only brought 2 of the 5 out. 5 mins later (yes I actually monitored the time) the other 3 entrees came out. 2 of the entrees were wrong. My husband ordered spaghetti and received a sandwich and I ordered a burger and received a piece of meat on hard bread, nothing else was on the burger. I told the waiter and he apologized. I told the waiter to take back my incorrect food and that I did not want my food replaced so just take it off the bill which he did. They brought my husbands correct entree, but at that point everyone else at the table was already done.  By the end we were annoyed and just ordered the strawberry shortcake to share. The ice cream was good but the biscuit was very hard and inedible.  Definitely will not be returning!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=100

As soon as we walked in (myself,a friend and my daughter) the host was in the back so she came about 5 mins which wasn't bad but she had attitude and didn't give her a kids menu. Okay! fine not a big deal, but as we're walking almost every table we passed was dirty! I mean DISGUSTING, while the waitresses and waiters was talking with each other. We sit down and the host begins to give her silverware(DIRTY SILVERWARE) we expressed we wanted plastic BC the silverware was so dirty her respond was to one talk to our waiter about that and two put the DIRTY( I mean food still on the fork dirty) back into the draw to give to other customers! (red flag) next I ordered a glass of Merlot .. I should've took a picture of my glass but it was so dirty my friend took it back to the bar BC it was greasy like someone literally just had a drink and they washed it with water and poured my wine in there. My friend took the wine back, spoke with the manager about how dirty the restaurant was, instead of him bringing the wine back asking did we need anything or just see how dirty the place was he sent a waiter. Now, someone comes and looks at the silverware ( not a Mgr) and begins to wipe he DIRTY silverware with a cloth .. A CLOTH! Not rewash them but a cloth! DISGUSTING! Â On top of everything, the waiters , omg their clothes were gross like they were in the back cooking the food themselves! Yes it was bad. Next to us was a set up where they came the dirty dishes (I guess and ice tea along with a register when everything was gross. I'm also attaching photos BC just expressing it isn't enough. So, all of this honestly probably happened within 15-20 mins tops. We got up walked over to the mgr.which is never came back to make sure i even Â received my wine and his respond was l'm embarrassed this place looks like this but I'm just coming in and trying to fix it , we expressed when trying to fix it first you need to rewash your dishes NOT wipe with a cloth! Also, as we are getting up from our table we were expressing it to another waiter with how dirty the place was and HE AGREED! Saying yeah I understand you guys are totally right it's dirty in here I'm sorry you guys had to come in and witness but we were confused BC everyone was standing around literally doing nothing while tables were still dirty ! I will never eat downtown Philly or even a drink at the Cheesecake Factory! My experience was horrible! I would not recommend anyone eating downtown Cheesecake Factory unless you want to get sick BC they don't clean anything! I have NEVER experienced anything like this before!

Sing L.,"Philadelphia, United States",0,11,,2.0,4/10/2015,"I have been to only 2 locations for The Cheesecake Factory. This one and the one in KoP. I was amazed by how good the food was when I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience at KoP, so I was thrilled to find out they were opening one up in center city.  I went a couple days after they opened and I was fairly upset with the quality. The pasta was just not as good and the hibachi steak was not as flavorful. The mashed potatoes had huge chunks in it, which kind of ruined that. I figured, they just opened up so maybe they will get better with time. Went there a second time hoping for a better experience but my hopes were shot down. The service was a little worse, which was already a bad start. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta this time and it was not as great as I was hoping. The pasta was decent but the chicken was incredibly bland. My girlfriend got the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo which is a let down. The shrimp was burnt and the steak was too salty. The mashed potatoes once again had huge chunks. Is it that hard to make proper mashed potatoes? We left that night with a Kahlua cheesecake to go because we had to get out of there. I don't know whether it's the thought of that Cheesecake Factory being a disappointment compared to the one at KoP that made the cheesecake a little worse or the fact that it was actually worse. Nevertheless, if you want Cheesecake Factory, take the drive and go to the one at KoP.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=100

Randomly stumbling in on a Monday night, my friends and I were seated immediately. The nightmare began when our waiter first approached the table to greet us and asked us if we had any questions about the menu, after waiting and waiting, he brought out only three waters.. when there was clearly four of us. We proceeded to place our orders, and after patiently waiting for our food and breadsticks, nothing. We called over the waiter and asked ""hi may we have our breadsticks?"" he replies, ""oh, you want breadsticks? sure"". We were very disappointed at the fact that we may have never received breadsticks if we had never asked. Not to mention, we finished our waters and had to sit around waiting for the waiter that never came to check up on our table. If we wanted more water, we had to wave over our server. So finally, our pasta dishes and pizza arrive at the table. It looks absolutely delicious, as always; however, the server did not bring out cheese.

After I asked for the cocktail price.. the waitress gave me a disdained look and never came back! Didn't even look at my friend and I again. Ok so I guess she assumed that we were poor cuz we asked the price of a mojito. After literally 15 Â minutes of no service, no water (cricket).. we LEFT. So I don't do this a lot, reviewing without trying the food. But here it is! My first and last Cheesecake Factory visit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia
Belle S.,"Philadelphia, United States",3,34,8,1.0,30/11/2017,"Came here with my boyfriend last night as we were deciding between iHOP and the CF since we were both really hungry and just wanted filling food.  The first thing I noticed was that when our waiter brought over our water there were lemon slices floating in it. I'm not a health freak but I always prefer my lemon wedges on the side of the glass because who knows if they even washed them? Anyway it was just a passing thought and I didn't think anything of it.  I ordered the pasta carbonara and immediately I knew there was something wrong. The sauce tasted so bland, except where the waitress grated Parmesan cheese over. I added salt and pepper and there was barely any difference. Regardless, I finished about half of it before my boyfriend and I decided to take the rest of our food to go.  I got home and I felt really sick all of a sudden. I went to bed early and when I got up for work the next morning I had an upset stomach. I called out from work and thank God that I did because a half hour later I threw up all the fluids I drank that morning. I threw up two more times afterwards and had an upset stomach two more times later in the day.  I didn't associate this with anything until I called my boyfriend at work and he said it sounded like I had food poisoning. I read up on the symptoms of it and he was right. I was shaking, feeling feverish, and my hands and feet were tingling. I had lost so much fluids that every time I stood up I started seeing black and white and had to hold onto something.  My boyfriend has been in the industry for more than 20 years, owned restaurants, been a partner, and been a general manager. He said that when sauces are left out too long, they lose their taste, and that was probably why I got so sick. He said he noticed me seasoning my dish with salt and was surprised as places like the Cheesecake Factory have dishes with high calorie counts and are already so flavorful to the point of being unhealthy.  I called the restaurant and told Anthony the GM what I had experienced and he offered to give me a gift card. I said no thank you and would prefer a partial refund for at least my portion of the meal. He said that it was not possible. I even offered to bring in the food we had taken home for him to inspect but he said it was not necessary.  Due to his lack of assistance, I called the guest services line in California and they were much more kind even though they still refused to offer a refund, though they did offer to look into the issue. They offered a gift card as well and I was thinking to myself, ""are these people serious? They think I want to get food poisoning again for free this time."" I said even if they can't offer me a refund I don't need a gift card as I would never return.  Clearly TCF Is only interested in money and not winning their customers back or making sure their health inspection standards are on par. Thanks for nothing!!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia
Sara K.,"Philadelphia, United States",0,12,2,1.0,23/10/2017,"As someone who is part of the industry and has been to Cheesecake multiple times, my friends and I were especially disappointed. The food was fine, you always know what to expect.  The service: To our server James, I guess he was having an especially bad day (we know bc he complained to us and our surrounding tables multiple times how he's been here all day). His banter with other tables as well as ours was EXTREMELY uncomfortable and inappropriate!!! Things were said that should NEVER be said as a server or by anyone in the service industry.  We waited an absurd amount for literally every part of our meal. We didn't get water or greeted for a good 10 minutes, in an empty restaurant. After we paid the check (which when we corrected him he told us to just give him $** amount bc I guess he didn't feel like changing it in the computer) and tipped him we waited around for our to go cheesecakes patiently even after everything, he finally came up to our table and said ""you can stay as long as you like I'm just gonna get this out of your way"" and took my friends tipped check and the menus, but ignored the empty dishes in front of us. Then we told him we're sitting here waiting for our cheesecakes, which he so obviously forgot. Even after very clearly letting him know how to separate them for the 3 of us he brought it over in one bag... I am extremely forgiving of service where ever I go, and never leave this long of a review, unless it is this bad and a place where I expect a higher standard.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia

Covered in crumbs and food smears. I cleaned my chair with a napkin before sitting because it was so dirty. Our water had chunks of food or something in it. Dirty tables, dirty walls, dirty seats.

Linda T.,"Queens, United States",128,257,924,4.0,7/7/2017,"This was my 1st time EVER trying the Cheesecake Factory in general. The one in Queens, New York is always packed and has a long wait. My friends told me that the one in Long Island, New York was the same thing. We found this place randomly while walking around looking for a place to eat for dinner. The place here is HUGE and we were seated right away. I'm not sure if people were away for the long July 4th weekend, but I was surprised that the place wasn't crowded. Many of the entree options are 1,500+ calories! I'm not surprised because I have heard on the news before that entrees at Cheesecake Factory have high calorie count. We ordered our entrees from the SkinnyLicious Menu. I opted for the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp and it comes with Angel Hair pasta. It was delicious and the shrimp tasted pretty fresh. The food portions were just right and I wasn't overly stuffed. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. She was happy to fulfill our requests. Our utensils and my napkin cloth were slightly dirty in the beginning and she got replacements for us. She checked up on us often to see if we needed anything else too. We didn't eat cheesecake here since we were full. Maybe next time we'll leave some room for dessert.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia

I normally only get cheesecake while i;m here but the adventurous side of me said ""bruh, lets get some carrotcake"".  And lemme tell ya...the Carrotcake was arguably the best I've had. I've had some good carrotcake in my short life, but the cheescake factory carrot cake was HUGE and very moist! Well worth the $8 value!  The Nachos are really...really..really good, too. It's usually all I can handle unless i'm sharing some with my greedy friends, i mean hungry friends.

Cindy M.,"Lansdowne, United States",274,562,3264,2.0,13/7/2017,This visit was a bust which makes me sad as we visited with out of town guests. We ordered apps which were good (nachos and artichoke and crab dip).  Hubby had a kale salad We barely started and our food came out.  Hubby was only able to finish half his salad which he held above the table since there were too many large plates (there were 5 of us). I ordered the combination ($22 approx) which had my favorite chicken merdiera with a salmon. Â The chicken was so small that it was disappointing. Â The salmon was drowned in a green chopped parsley (type) that I could not even tell it was salmon. Â See my pic One plate didn't come out for about 10 min later so we all waited and ate our food cold. Â I mean if you're going To bring the food out early bring it out together. Everyone's else said the food was good  Waitress was eh. I think I was more disappointed that she didn't say anything when my husband was eating in the air w his bowl  The others had dessert but I was so turned off by my meal that I didn't bother.  $200 later and I was disappointed  Wish I spent a bit more and went to Delfriscos.  Yes I'll try again but I know to avoid the combo and wait to order my meal Â  Â I guess w most chains u get a hit or miss you waitress and you have to know the tips when ordering I should add the last few times we visited everything is great... this visit was just so disappointing.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia
Sherry X.,"Philadelphia, United States",8,79,99,3.0,26/5/2017,"FYI: Their portion sizes are HUGE and the calorie count definitely matches what you get so you might be eating a full days worth of calories in a single meal.  The fiancÃ© and I were in center city on a date night sorta type thing and came here before checking out some DIY wedding supplies at the AC Moore nearby. Let's just say....it's been a while. WHAT I GOT: Grilled fish tacos PROS: First of all, I gotta give it up to our waiter. He was legit the sweetest person ever with the way he talked to us and served us during the meal that it made up for the lack of flavor in our food. And I also appreciate the fact that the Cheesecake Factory lists the calorie count of their food. I mean, for how big their portions are, you can kinda guess how much you're taking in but it's also good to have a set number. The food was cooked pretty well: nice moist chicken and flaky fish. All the ingredients tasted fresh and there were some good flavor combinations in my taco. The ambiance of this place is also pretty cozy and definitely family friendly. CONS: Where to start...well for starters, my taco shells were uhhh...limp and cold. And the fish on the inside joined them within minutes of hitting the table. The cilantro rice they serve with it tasted ok but that's about it. Just ok. They also gave me a little bowl of beans but I took two bites and left it alone. My fiancÃ©'s truffle honey chicken was incredibly bland though. The skin didn't taste like much, neither did the meat on the inside. Most of the flavor came from the sauce on the plate. His mashed potatoes were peppery af but with the chicken, it wasn't terrible. I'm not sure if the quality of the food decreased since the last time I had it but it definitely wasn't really something I'd be like ""dying to try"".",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia

The inside is nice and I'm sure other employees their are nice. The dessert area looked messy and the girl behind the counter just wasn't professional at all. I won't be returning to this location.

Jasmine A.,"Vancouver, Canada",162,276,823,2.0,23/11/2016,"Starving, we stopped at the Cheescake Factory for lunch. Â The Cheescake Factory isn't anything special--typical North American kind of dishes, such as pastas, burgers, etc, the type of food that hits the spot when you're hungry. There were plenty of tasty options, but looking through the menu, I was horrified. Â I knew the Cheesecake Factory isn't the best place to go if you're health conscious, but my god, the calorie content was absolutely horrific; most of their dishes were between 1500 to 2000 calories each, an entire day's worth of calories. Â Ugh. Â Thank goodness they had a ""skinny"" menu which offered lower calorie dishes, around 600 calories each. Off the skinny menu, I ordered the enchiladas (I just couldn't order from the regular menu, knowing that I would be consuming 1800 calories in one sitting). Â I still don't quite believe that they were ""only"" 590 calories, as they were a full portion and extremely filling.

The appetizer came out in decent time and the food quickly followed but we maybe saw our waitress once at this point and I asked to order a sparkling water and she said sure I'll bring it right out. 20 mins later still no drink, I had to ask another waiter to get it for me.

Skyla C.,"Philadelphia, United States",64,156,1570,2.0,26/12/2016,Cheesecake factory has been around for the longest but we decided to dine in tonight because the waiting line at max brenner was just too crazy . I first had cheesecake factory when it was opened years ago back at home in Boston. I never really liked the food there . 5 stars goes towards their cheesecakes though. So we decided to give cheesecake factory a second chance.  When we first walked in hostess greeted us but gave us a weird look instead of a smile . Points off there . And then told us there's about 15 to 20 mins wait and we said okay that's fine. She didn't lock us in the computer at first until another Â group came in after us and see us just standing there. We then was given a number beeper and told we could go right ahead upstairs . Surprising the wait wasn't long . So that was good . Took us a bit to look over the menu because there was a variety to choose from. So our waitress came and took our orders for drinks and apps . We decided to get buffalo Blast and dynamite shrimp for appetizers (as pictured) . The Buffalo blast was good . The dynamite shrimp was okay. It could use a little more flavor . For entrÃ©e I decided to go with the chicken marsala and my boyfriend got the meatloaf. When the drink came she only brought my boyfriend drink and told me my drink will be out shortly. I thoughts all the drinks supposed to come out at the same time and not just one and while the other wait for theirs . But okay. The first appetizer came out which was the Buffalo blast half way eating it my drink still hasn't come yet and I was thirsty after a few bites . My drink didn't come out until my entrÃ©e came out which was probably 20 mins after . Sign of bad service because the couple next to us ordered drinks and all their drinks came out right away by a different waitress . After a few bites of our food we was ready to leave because my boyfriend didn't like how his food taste and my chicken marsala was sweet and the sauce tasted burnt while I was eating it . I didn't want to make a big deal out of it so we just asked the waitress to packed the food to go . I should of just stick to my instance and went elsewhere because the food hasn't meet our expectations .

Renea R.,"Philadelphia, United States",4,219,2,4.0,19/6/2017,"My friend, Naomi (also known as BB or Birthday Bitch), invited a group of around 10 friends to the Cheesecake Factory for a celebration of her being born. Â I had been to the King of Prussia CF but never to the downtown location. Â The CF is always a bit of an odyssey into another world, where people have expendable cash and suburban hairstyles and where decadence is supremely exalted, in both garish displays of dÃ©cor and overall gluttony. Â In this way, the Cheesecake Factory is a quite viscerally American experience. While waiting at the bar I chatted with my buddy, Hawkeye, and spent $10 on a bottled Angry Orchard. Â Cocktails were in the double digit range, and seeing how I was a poor social worker masquerading as a person who can afford to eat at fancy restaurants, I opted to not get any more alcoholic drinks throughout my stay. Eventually we were moved to a large table that could accommodate our group. Â Our server was polite and attentive and tolerant of our low class requests, such as bringing me hot sauce to pair with the free bread they serve. Â Speaking of the free bread, it was delicious and regrettably I ate quite a lot of it despite having given up gluten recently. Communing with the other indigent social workers, Hawkeye and I decided to split some nachos with our friend Brenda. Â The calorie content was well over your overall daily allowance so it seemed that splitting it three ways would be wise. Â Getting swept up in the gluttony of this establishment, I impulsively decided to also order their ""Nashville Hot"" chicken nuggets which were only $5. Â They claimed to be quite hot, which I considered dubious but figured it was worth a try. When the nachos arrived, they were as enormous as we had hoped and had generous portions of good toppings including spicy chicken, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa. Â I wouldn't say that there was anything particularly ""special"" about these nachos, but they were large, filling, and tasty so I was very happy with this decision. Â They were also more than enough for three people and frankly I did not need my impulsive chicken nuggets. Â Speaking of the chicken nuggets, I found them very underwhelming. Â Only one chicken nugget out of ten was sufficiently saucy and the overall heat level was practically imperceptible. BB's new man friend, Landon (who worked hard all night to prove to us that he wasn't a Blandon) got the fried mac and cheese balls and generously shared with the table in what I can only imagine was a ploy to win good favor in the group. Â These were cheese-filled pillows of heaven and you could only hope to be so lucky as to get to experience them for free at some point in your lifetime. Â He also got a very mysterious dish which was a pizza made with chicken-parmesan crust and pasta on top. Â I didn't get to taste it but I can only imagine that it was quite indulgent. At the conclusion of the meal, a handful of the brave ordered cheesecake. Â Thanks to the plentiful free bread I was bloated up like a hot air balloon and had no money or appetite left for dessert but I admired those that were able to go ""all the way."" Â I have had CF Cheesecake before and it's incredibly delicious, probably as a result of each slice including over three quarters of your daily calorie content. In the end, what could be more wholesomely American than group of ten 20-something-year-olds (okay fine, I'm 30...) caucusing in the soft glow of ornate chandeliers of ostentation, eating a week's worth of calories in food they will have to buy on credit to afford, surrounded by suburban families ignoring everything but their iphones. Â BB seemed happy to usher in a new year of life in this manner and frankly I enjoyed myself and the food very much.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=20

There were swaths of time where all of our dishes were on the table without being taken away for room, where we wanted more water, where we waited to order the food, waited for the check.

Bhavika P.,"Philadelphia, United States",75,185,574,3.0,26/1/2017,Had a no calorie count kinda day today and I enjoyed it by having the delicious cheesecakes (while chocolate raspberry truffle being my fav of all).  Starters: Avocado egg rolls was yum specially the dip that comes with it just makes it perfect. I loved it. Nachos was alright.  Main course: bang bang chicken and shrimp. Was too sweet for me. I am not sure if it always supposed to take like that but I did not enjoy it at all due to the sweetness.  Dessert: Plain cheesecake and raspberry truffle.  Great place to go when you are a big group and everyone has a different cuisine in mind as this place serves almost everything right from eggs to desserts!! Low calorie and full of calorie!!  I took off 2 stars only because the service seemed slow even on a empty afternoon lunch hour. We were a big group (16) no doubt but I think we needed 2 people to take care than just 1. The server was really good no complains but taking care of so many people was too time consuming and there was a long break between the appetizers and main course.  The quantity of food is huge.

Angela L.,"Merion Station, United States",273,66,236,2.0,18/6/2017,"I rarely ever complain about a restaurants service and kitchen staff; however, the dining experience at this specific Cheesecake Factory was absolutely awful. For starters, the waiter listened to our orders, didn't write them down and then proceeded to come back to the table and ask us for our orders again. The three of us dining all made modifications to our orders. When he brought out orders over, he did not take note of the modifications, resulting in us having to wait even longer for our food. Once our ""correct"" food came over, there was still food missing and the quality was not good. My mom ordered the grilled chicken tostado salad. The tostado was limp and soaked instead of crispy, and there was no chicken on the salad. I ordered the Tuscan chicken subbed with salmon which comes with artichokes but there were no artichokes, and the salmon portion was so small. I had gone to the King of Prussia location the night before which had a salmon filet double the size served at the Philadelphia location. The manager was nice enough to give me another portion of salmon but the overall quality of service and food was sub-par at best.

Christina L.,"Philadelphia, United States",236,7,15,4.0,31/7/2017,"Take the escalators up to the lively and spacious Cheesecake Factory located in the heart of Center City Philadelphia. Â This place is known for their inviting ambiance, and more importantly, Â the extensive variety of delicious cheesecakes they provide. Food: 3.5/5 - The cheesecakes are without a doubt their signature desserts. Â Rich, sweet, and absolutely fulfilling, these pieces (running from 6-8 dollars a piece) will have you wondering what flavor you should get on your next visit. Â Their main dishes are not as impressionable and tend to be over-seasoned. Â Many of their dishes consist of pasta, sandwiches, and other familiar American favorites (roasted chicken, tacos, etc). Â The cheesecake alone gets a 4.5/5 rating in my book; however, the other options do not measure up. Service: 3/5 - The waiters and waitresses are friendly but tend to get lost during peak dining hours. Â No matter what request you have, they are extremely happy and willing to fulfill your request.... it may just take some time to get your check or that extra straw you needed five minutes ago. Ambiance: 3.5/5 - Like any other Cheesecake Factory, this location is spacious and has a high-ceiling providing a nice break from the usual Philadelphian restaurant scene. Â The warm colored interior invites birthday parties to the casual diners. Â  Value: 4/5 - For a restaurant chain, the prices tend to be on the higher end. Â However, these prices are justified by their huge portions. Â They are much greater than your typical restaurants (especially in for being in the city). Â More often then not, you will be coming out quite full and taking home the leftovers. OVERALL RATING: 3.5/5 Personal Recommendation: For the best Cheesecake Factory experience, I recommend coming here just for the cheesecakes. Â Expecting or looking for more will probably leave you a bit unsatisfied.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=20

We walked a couple blocks over, took the elevator upstairs and were greeted by a hangry mob. Well, basically. It was midday on a Saturday and this place was bursting at the seams with people waiting for tables. Originally we planned to eat-in until we heard about the crazy wait time. No thanks. Fortunately, they do have a to-go counter. While the process of ordering was a bit unorganized and the staff unfriendly, we were able to snag our cheesecake slices and leave within about 10 minutes. I ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough, and it was pretty darn good. I don't want to consider the calorie count on that thing...but if you're in the mood for an extra sweet snack, you could very well visit this accessible spot. Of course, there's also the option of stopping in one of the local haunts, where you're likely to find stellar fare at better prices.

The manager acknowledged that there had just been extermination. At that point we all opted to leave the establishment as none of us had much of an appetite after that incident. I highly recommend that extermination be done after hours and allow enough time so that bugs such as roaches be totally eliminated before the establishment reopens.

They made us sit at ""the end of the bar"" which was two seats at a lower counter, so the barman barely saw us. Nobody came to give us a menu so we had to take one by ourselves. Nobody came to take our order for 15mn until we finally ask for someone. They didn't gave us water nor bread automatically, we had to ask for it. Every time. Even for forks, knives and napkins. Â We wanted to change our seats because the counter was next to the restroom so many people were walking behind us. They gave us a ""beeper"" saying that we will have a table in 20mn. 20 mn later, an other woman was working at the front desk and she told me with in a condescending and annoyed way that I can't transfer from a table to another. Also the waiter didn't take our order correctly so we had to wait 35 mn total to finally have our food. I got the meatball pasta, which was really tasteless, my friend had the Miso Salmon, which wasn't bad. At the beginning we wanted some desert but we though that this place didn't deserved our money.

I have only been to this restaurant once but what is not to like? Â The venue is stunning and the location is superb. Â The tables are set far apart from each other and the ceilings are very high making it easy to catch up with friends and loved ones in a seemingly private and quiet setting. Â I found all of the wait staff to be very friendly and accommodating and there are tons of delicious and inexpensively priced items to choose from on the menu. Â I appreciate that they offered a skinny menu and found the chopped salad on that menu to be amazing. At $12 I had it for dinner and for lunch the next day.

Kendra S.,"Eatontown, United States",0,4,,1.0,17/10/2015,"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever dealt with. From beginning to end the service could not have been any worse. When we walked into the door the hostess did not seem to want to be bothered with any of the customers. I had asked for a table to seat 13 people and was told the wait would be about an hour. After about 35 minutes of waiting, my party and I noticed that the hostess had walked out of the restaurant. A customer had asked us if we were waiting to be seated and we replied ""yes,"" he then informed us that the restaurant had been struggling that night and that he waited over 30 minutes for a to go order. We were then seated after about an hour and a half wait, but when we arrived at our table there were only 11 seats and even those were crammed together. We asked management if we could have another table added to the two that were already pushed together and the staff made it seem as though it was too difficult of a task to be done, so we began to move the tables ourselves until finally one of the employees saw and politely moved them for us. The hostess we had, who never mentioned her name throughout the entire meal, had the worst customer service I have ever seen. She asked if we would like drinks but only took drink orders for 5 of the guests. When asked about one of the drinks on the menu, the waitress seemed clueless. After we finished our appetizers, our meals began to come out, but our waitress did not take any of our finished dishes from the table in order to make room. After our meals, our waitress did not even ask if we would like to have any left overs wrapped to go or if we would like dessert, even after two guests ordered cheesecake. Throughout the entire dinner, my party, as well as myself, did not have a good time and we all agreed that we will not be attending this location ever again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=200
T S.,"Philadelphia, United States",0,1,,1.0,15/1/2016,"The dÃ©cor in the restaurant was great but the service and the food were horrible. Â I tried this location twice and each time has been worst. I tried to attribute the first visit to the location just opening and the staff was new but the second time was worst. Â My husband order an appetizer, the wings and they were dry and overcooked. Â We ordered our entrees, Miso Salmon and I ordered a burger. Â The Miso salmon was dry and didn't have all the ingredients such as the miso that he was used to, when he tried to explain this to the waitress she had no idea what the dish should look like and never brought over the manager. Â My burger which I thought was a safe selection was either left over from the day before and was served on the dinner rolls that they serve when you arrive. Â We have always visited the Cheesecake Factory in the King of Prussia mall and never experience this service or horrible food. Â If in center city stick to the local restaurants or bars but don't try this place.

Rob L.,"Philadelphia, United States",0,3,,2.0,6/8/2015,"i love cheesecake factory--food's not gourmet but the ambiance is fun so it makes up for it. i've been to at least 10 different locations in various states and this one is by far the worst of them all. nothing ruins an experience more than poor service. horrible service.  we were seated pretty quickly on a Saturday afternoon, but no one came to our table for the next 10-15 minutes--not even to give us water. when they came to take our drink order, it took another 10-15 minutes for them to bring it to us--the place wasn't packed and there were servers all over the place and ours was nowhere to be found. a different server came over to bring a beer and then our actual server finally came with my iced tea and 1 water even though there were 2 of us. we were sure to order the app and entree at the same time since it was apparent it would take awhile. the appetizer came at a normal speed--after taking 2 bites, Â a completely different server came with the entree--great timing and communication. as were finishing up the meal--i'm still taking bites from the plate,the server came back and asked if we were done...ok, i guess so. we then ordered a cheesecake to-go--she came back with the check and 15 minutes later the cheesecake came from yet another server. how many people does it take to serve 2 people?

Kirk S.,"Philadelphia, United States",6,13,30,5.0,26/8/2016,"I have written other reviews regarding the regular dining menu at TCF. this review is strictly about the happy hour menu offered between 4 and 6PM Monday thru Friday. I have gone once by myself around Five PM and it was very busy but my experience was very good. had to wait a bit for drinks sometimes but considering thre rush the delay was understandable. This time i went with a friend and we showed up right after Four PM. Big difference in the room. Not nearly as busy or loud. I'll just list the items that we ordered along with their happy hour price-Chicken Pot Stickers ($5.50), Crispy Crab Bites ($7.50,real crab meat), The Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip ($5.50-had two orders in house and my friend ordered one to go, that's how great the dip is. Intoxicating and addictive!), Dynamite Tempura Shrimp ($6.95-not as spicy as I had been led to think they would be but good flavor nonetheless. If you order the house wine, be it white, red, or zinfandel, (I had my usual Merlot) the price is $5.50. Name brand wines will cost more (Like my friend's Moscato @ $9.50). You can get beer for $3-4 and drinks such as Long Island Iced teas, mojitos, and margaritas for $5.50! There are so many appetizers that we didn't get to try this time nut are looking forward to on our next trip. The price is right and the earlier you come the better the service will be. After five it can get busy so things will take longer. Wanted to also mention our server Craig M. who answered our questions and, if didn't know the answer, he would go and find out. He was friendly and patient, even bringing us fresh, warm bread when the first basket came out cold and hard. Thanks Craig!  So, if you are looking to try The Cheesecake Menu without paying the regular prices, try their happy hour. You will probably be tempted into going back to try the regular menu at some point in the future.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=80

Jessie H.,"Manhattan, United States",276,933,651,3.0,13/7/2015,This location just recently opened so I think they're still sorting out everything. I got the chicken pasta carbonara and my friend got the santa fe salad. She asked for her salad dressing to be on the side but they mixed it in.

Shannon R.,"Philadelphia, United States",134,14,,2.0,26/7/2016,"This was my 1st time at this location. Â The building and atmosphere is gorgeous. Â Thankfully they have an elevator in addition to the escalators and steps. Â I was with a rather large group of people, and we were able to be seated in a private room with a wonderful view of Philadelphia. Â This was good and bad. Â Why? Â As it got darker outside, the dimmer the lights became on the inside, to the point where we were all pulling out our cellphones to use the lights to read our menus!  For my drink, I ordered a glass of Moscato. Â Unfortunately they were out of it. :( Â So, I ordered a glass of Riesling. Â It was pretty good. Â The only thing i didn't like was the fact that the wine glasses were so large, yet they only filled it up halfway! Â I guess that's to make you order another glass. Â Who knows. Â Needless to say, for $9.50, that was my only glass of wine for the night. Â Grade: B My appetizer was the Fried Zucchini. Â I asked for mine without cheese and marinara sauce instead of ranch dressing. Â I was looking forward to it, since this is one of my favorite appetizers in the world, and everywhere I have gone either took it off of their menus or it has been absolutely horrendous! Â Well...The Cheesecake factory made me happy! Â Thick pieces of Zucchini sticks, light and crispy breading and wasn't served as a greasy mess! Â The people I shared them with agreed that they were very good. Â The portion was very large. Â I ended up ordering more to go with my main course. Â Grade: A+ My main course for dinner was Fish and Chips. Â Well. Â I can honestly say that I've had better in less-costing restaurants. Â The flsh was fried nice and crispy, but it was very bland. Â The fries were good. Â Grade: C Dessert: Â I ordered the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake for myself and the Godiva Cheesecake for my friend. Â Both were awesome, like always! Â Grade: A+ The only thing that I can completely say that I was truly upset about was the salad that I ordered to-go. Â It was the French Country Salad with mixed greens, grilled asparagus, fresh beets, goat cheese, candied pecans and vinaigrette. Â I was very disappointed when I got home and opened up the salad. Â Extremely wilted lettuce. Â There were only a couple pieces of beets and they looked dried out. Â We won't even talk about the asparagus. Â About 2 goat cheese crumbles. Â All I can say is that this was a major disappointment for the amount that it cost. Grade:D Overall, my experience with the food was ok. Â Our server, Anna, did a good job with serving a large group. Â The only issue I had was sending my check back for corrections. Â  Will I go back to this particular location? Â Not sure. Â We shall see. Â   Overall Grade: Â C",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-philadelphia?start=80

Then finally for desert I had the snickers cheesecake. Omg it was so good. Everything was so good. Although it was crowded when we went, we didn't wait that long for food.

Huy L.,"Philadelphia, United States",0,4,4,3.0,5/12/2016,"First star is for the decoration. This location is for young people who cannot drive to other locations. Second star is for the service. Nice and friendly. Third star is for cheese cake. Should try the mango key lime one. Beautiful cake comes with multiple layer of flavors, tastes, and textures. Minus 2 stars because the grilled food was horrible. I ordered KOBE Style burger with Medium cook. They handed me a burned well done and dried meat. I called the server to request a new one. My friends already finished their meals and I had to wait for my burger in 20 mins. Second time was less burn but still complete well done and dried. They use gas grill and you can smell the gas on every bite. I wanted throw up after a first bite. The sever was so nice so I just let it go and pack it home. Of course, I will throw it away. Cannot eat it. My friend's pork chop dish was $23 and it was burned as well. The burn layer was like 1/8 inches. She had to cut it out and eat it without requesting to change her dish. In general, it was overpriced for the quality of food.

Courtney J.,"Philadelphia, United States",1,23,,2.0,24/10/2016,I am not the kind of person that is against chain restaurants and will gladly eat at a cheesecake factory even when there are other non-chain restaurants to choose from. So I've been to probably 4 other cheesecake factories in different cities and this one was definitely the worst. The shrimp in my pasta was very overcooked and the dish itself was underseasoned.

Jonathan L.,"Garden Grove, United States",10,37,4,1.0,1/7/2016,"This location sucks. So I ordered to go after walking half a mile from where I'm staying so I wouldn't lose my parking spot.

So when I walk all the way back and get to my food, it had no marinara sauce, about a quarter of the tomatoes that it's supposed to have, and only 4 shrimp. WTF?! I paid 20 bucks for this dish and it pretty much was only plain noodles with olive oil. I don't feel like walking another mile there and back to return this bland Â joke of a meal.

So I kindly asked if we go up because we were unattended and she was clearly trying to avoid us. Then she held her hand up and said one minute please in an aggravated tone. So after going in circles for 30 minutes trying to find parking we dont even get acknowledged when we walk in to the place.

She heard our compliant and never returned to let us know what was going on or to even apologized or ask us how our food turned out. By the time the food came out, the other 4 people were almost finished and the kids had to eat bread because they were so hungry. I was never treated so poorly at any other cheesecake factory before in my life.

How long does it take to cook a burger??????? Like really. One positive thing, was the view. Hell, I'll take good service over view any day. Valet was pretty pricey @ $22.00 a car.
