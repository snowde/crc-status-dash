Brenda R.,"Phoenix, AZ",110,155,573,5.0,1/2/2018,I came here to have a Christmas dinner for work and the hostess greeted us right away and told us it would be about 20 minutes because we arrived early. She was kind enough to keep us updated on our tables and they would take us back shortly. As soon as we were taken to our table our waitress greeted us and asked for our drink selection. Considering there was 13 of us the drinks came out really fast and no mistakes. She then took all of our orders and was very friendly. I ordered the filet mignon medium with veggies and mashed potatoes. Everything was cooked exactly as i ordered and let me say i cleaned off the plate. We all then ordered cheesecake to go and they have an extensive selection on cheesecakes. That by far was the hardest part to decide which one i wanted. I really enjoyed it here and will be back to try other foods from their endless menu choices.  This location in particular can validate your parking so make sure to take your chip in with you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix
Funky D.,"Phoenix, AZ",28,119,,4.0,10/9/2017,"The Factory is winning with its appetizers. They aren't cheap, but from small plates to small salads, I don't remember having an app I didn't like.  On my latest visit, I dared to try the fried Mac and Cheese balls. I kept wavering at first, because I couldn't imagine their mac and cheese tasting any different than a box of pre-packaged stuff lurking in my pantry. But whoa! The dish knocked my socks off. Can I get an AMEN for comfort? The nicely fried balls were close to 2.5 inches round with large noodles mixed with creamy cheesy goodness. I don't know what blend of cheese is used, but I was happy that I couldn't taste american cheese. And it wasn't as greasy as you would think. The mac balls are topped with a tomato-cheese dip that also taste pretty good. Four balls cost $11.95 Avocado Egg Rolls (11.95) speak for themselves and the accompanying dip speaks for everything else:  Six half rolls per dish are served on top of some useless white crunchy sticks that I ignore every time. I forgot to ask if I could substitute lettuce for them. At least then the egg rolls would be sitting on top of something pretty. Oh well, maybe I can save packing costs by using the sticks as padding for the next package I send for X-mas. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes (10.95): I've ordered this before and wanted to try a second time. Yes, it's a comforting dish. Sweet corn kernels are baked into three tamale pancakes and covered in garnish of avocado, pico, cream, and some kind of relish (which I just realized today) tastes very similar to Thousand Island. Would I go to the Factory without ordering cheesecake? No, no I wouldn't. Ever since I had a good run with the Struessel (which they no longer carry unfortunately) I've been tasting other flavors. This time I decided on the Lemon/Raspberry, dulce de leche, and white choco/raspberry. Hmmm, I like all three.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix
Lauren A.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,211,137,4.0,10/7/2017,"I hadn't been here in years but it was just as good as I remember it, only a little more expensive. We met some friends here for dinner. Parking on a Friday night is a challenge but they have valet if you don't want to circle around. When we checked in we were told it would be around 15 minutes but they had us seated in about 5. Their menu is huge. Honestly, it's too big but there is something for everyone which is nice. We started with the crispy Cuban egg rolls and the stuffed garlic bread which were both excellent, the dipping sauce for the egg rolls was delicious! There was a variety of dishes from Alfredo, salads, steak Diane, another pasta dish and my orange chicken on the table and everything looked good. My orange chicken had great flavor and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The serving size was huge so I had the rest for lunch the next day. We were all stuffed but but you can't leave without trying the cheesecake. We tried the salted Carmel and a couple of milkshakes for our younger dining counterparts. The service was excellent and our servers were very friendly and helpful.  My dinner bill for 3 with an appetizer, sodas, 3 entrees, 1 piece of cheesecake and a milkshake was $93.00 before the tip. The only downside of the dinner was the restrooms. Two of the three stalls had no toilet paper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix

Reeses was delicious but let's be real, you really cannot mess up a Reeses cheesecake... The red velvet however was extremely lacking and almost flavorless (minus the obvious super sweetness). I'm not a fan of processed food and pretty much everything that comes out of their kitchen (almost any chain restaurant) is processed.

Meals that were ordered included the grande burrito, eggplant parmesan, spicy chipotle chicken pasta, and spaghetti cabonara. Everyone enjoyed it! The waiter was really nice so we ended up giving the rest of our cake to the staff! We will be back again for sure!  The only cons I would say is the lighting inside (pretty dark) and the pricing is a little expensive but I'm sure people come to the restaurant knowing they are going to pay a pretty penny.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix
Gee L.,"Phoenix, AZ",186,463,1457,4.0,9/3/2017,"I am judging this from a HUGE CHAIN perspective, to be fair. The winner here at our meal was the fresh baked bread which seemed right out of Jersey City...the bread brought me back home. I have to think hard about the rest of our meal. I had the Asian chicken, kind of a brown sauce with lots of spice. It was okay. The salad was good. I can see why people like this place, it is large and can accommodate a million families and the dessert menu and case at the exit are quite alluring. I guess I would bring an older friend or parent here. I like better food....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix

The menu is extensive so there's something for everyone, however, since they don't exactly have a specialty, all the entrees come across as bland. My sliders we soggy and several of the other appetizers we tried were average at best. Big surprise - the cheesecake is good.

Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,8/9/2017,"Well, we were all very hungry and we picked Cheesecake factory as it was 1 pm and the crowd was mostly gone.   We got seated promptly, however, our waitress seemed like she was rushing at every pass.  Ordering our drinks, our food, it was like sit down and tell her immediately what we want.  There was no warmth there at any level.  Very poor service.  We felt very uncomfortable. Needless to say, we ordered our salads and we ordered Ranch and got Vinagarette!  How does that happen?  RUSHING!!!!  We had to get them replaced twice. We ordered our entree's along with an appetizer.  So, I don't know what the Brea Ca location is doing right, but the other locations need to follow it.  The QA at this facility was atrocious. We tried the Fried zucchini once again and once again, let down.  There was zero, zip, nada flavor at all.  In Brea, they had awesome seasoning and were cooked perfectly.  Here it was dumped and served.  Just terrible.  I ordered the Eggplant Parmasean for my Entree.  We waited about 20 minutes only for the waitress to come back and say they were out.  How can you be out of Eggplant at lunch at 1 pm???  Again, lack of rigor and discipline in the kitchen as you should never run out of anything especially a top seller. So I had to find something else and ordered the Truffle Honey Chicken.  What a disappointment.  Two small pieces of this so called chicken were as hard as a rock.  You had a very hard time cutting it with the sharpest knife and it was un-edible as it was too hard to chew.  It was like eating rocks. The Gumbo was ok, but slopped in the bowl and lacked any presentation as well as the orange chicken. We tried to end on a good note with a piece of their new Celebration Cheesecake.  Well, unless you like Icing and I mean a lot of icing this is for you.  However, if you like a cake along with your icing this is not for you.  This was layer and layer of icing on a very, very small sliver of cake.  What a waste.  This one needs to be shelved. Needless to say, Cheesecake Factory lacks QA across the board and the food gets wasted as it cannot be eaten.  Very frustrated on this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix

Then save room for the cheesecake of course, depending on your taste you can't be beat here. I go for the old school Strawberry Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake, Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake. Prices are in the $12 - $20 range with good quality and huge portions.

Sarah J.,"Phoenix, AZ",19,103,34,5.0,9/6/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a well oiled, fine tuned machine. They have good food, good service, great ambiance, fun atmosphere, and reasonable prices.  The first thing you notice about Cheesecake Factory is how enormous and grandeur it is. The colors are beautiful and warm, and even though it is a huge restaurant each table feels tucked away and private. This is a great place for a romantic dinner for two, or for a giant group. There is a bar area with tvs for game watching, and a patio for when it's nice outside, so there's a place for everyone to be happy.  The staff is wonderful; everyone greets you warmly and seems to love what they do. The servers are extremely attentive, efficient, quick, and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy and get what you want. They know the menu front to back which is quite impressive considering it is about 20 pages long. The most difficult thing about eating at The Cheesecake Factory is figuring out what you want to eat. The menu is HUGE, and offers everything; pastas, steaks, gourmet chicken dishes, seafood, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wings, quesadillas, and even breakfast. You name it, most likely they have it! You would think with such a large menu the food would be mediocre, but on the contrary it is actually delicious. I have never had a bad meal here or been disappointed with a dish. They even bring out warm bread and butter to get you started. If you save room don't forget their cheesecakes, they are exceptional.  Cheesecake Factory is a great place for a solid meal any time of the day. You'll find something for everyone and you'll go home full, satisfied, and most likely with lots of leftovers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix

Alyssa F.,"Grover Beach, CA",3,60,423,1.0,1/16/2017,"Tastes like dog food. All of it.  Like oh my god.  Worse than apple bees.  I wouldn't even give a homeless person this as a meal...... They probably wouldn't even eat it. Bad service, took forever. I wasted so much gas waiting in the takeout parking spot. The shrimp roll.... Had ONE HALF of a shrimp in each roll..... I guess that's the portion for real... The sauces that come with it are garbage, inedible.  The noodles in it are gross. Overall a bad choice. So disappointing.  Crab artichoke dip tastes like canned TUNA and rotten. I felt like throwing up after I ate it. Plus they gave me four tiny slices of bread for a huge portion of fishy nasty dip. Just pretend you mixed cream cheese with cat food and warmed it up... There you go. Edemame, freaking soggy and salty... Potstickers..... Tasted like canned chicken... Sauce was super strong and nasty. Looked frozen and microwaved. $55 FOR THIS  FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS..............::::: FIFTY.       FIVE.    DOLLLARS.        WHAT THE HELL. I am without words.  I have been to a cheese cake factory before in CA. It was edible atleast... This one was a JOKE.  One word.  DISGUSTING.  We're still hungry and threw it all out. Had to go get a burger some where else. The stand $6 for a burger... What a relief. $6  SIX DOLLARS  SIX.   DOLLARS.   Cheese cake factory.... How are you in business ??? And how do you live with yourself feeding people all of this nasty food... I wonder how many people have been sick and disappointed from eating here... Stay away. Go to the stand or honestly Taco Bell, McDonalds... Anywhere else... Yuck id rather eat pink slime from McDonald's than cheese cake factory ever again...

It was good , nothing special to write home about. It's a flatten chicken cutlet over a bed of angel hair pasta and like a pesto sauce.

Our waitress was useless, she messed up more things about our order than I could have ever imagined, and dropped two of our dishes upon bringing them to our table (This caused us to wait even longer due to remaking of our food.).  After always needing to ask for more water and asking three times for mayo, saying she was awful is an understatement.   The only reason this place is getting three stars is because when you finally get the food it's always pretty good with nice serving sizes.

My dish of Skinny Chicken Pasta was cold and I had to look for my chicken but decided not to say anything.  Our bill was $360.00 and not objecting  to that but the kicker was that my husband was celebrating his Birthday and his cheesecake was supposed to be complimentary.

No one liked what they ordered the only thing I enjoyed was the appetizer and my glass of wine.

Keith S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",19,21,11,5.0,9/14/2015,"When going to this restaurant location specifically I recommend parking in the paid parking lot across from the entrance. It will give you a little yellow token that you can validate when you are leaving and will save you the hassle of trying to find a spot in this busy location.  Now for the restaurant! This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to and the only Cheesecake Factory location I really like. The atmosphere is very lively sometimes noisy and most workers are very friendly and helpful. The lighting is rather dim in certain seating locations. I would say it is ""too romantic"" when it comes to the lighting if that was a lighting setting.  Almost all of the servers I have had in the past were great with timing, knowledge of the vast menu, friendliness and attention to your needs. The food is always great and I have never regretted my decision when ordering. The Red Sangria and Moscow Mules were perfect for drink choices. I even ordered an A.M.F. (a dangerously blue heavier alcoholic drink. Those who know understand) which was not even on the drink menu. I was surprised on how accommodating this location was. They even bring an extra plate if you are sharing a dish and have split it up before. I recommend the Shrimp Bistro Pasta or Chicken Madeira for a main entree and the Portabella, Avocado and Zucchini Fries for an appetizer. Those are just my go to choices.  The only problem, as with every other Cheesecake Factory or Man vs. Food competition, is trying to reach that last bite and in this scenario it's the cheesecake. This cheesecake is probably more total calories than all the food leading up to it and it's worth it. If you ask for a cheesecake to-go container you will put it in the fridge only to open it up before bed and finish it. I highly recommend this location and restaurant chain and don't forget to validate before leaving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=80

I split the Louisiana Chicken pasta and even so the portion was filling. Good pasta with a kick to eat, creamy sauce and perfectly fried chicken.

Leah L.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,15,,1.0,3/8/2016,"We had a VERY disappointing experience here Friday night. I called just after they opened to see if I could bring in a cake for our server to bring to our table for my daughter's birthday. The manager I spoke to was pleasant and confirmed that, yes, I could bring in my own cake, and just let our server know that I had brought it in.  I took the cake and bday candles to them early in the afternoon, and the hostess who took it made a note that it was mine and then put it in their fridge up front.  Once we arrived that evening, I spoke to the hostess (on the DL, so my daughter would be surprised), and asked her to tell our server Brandon that the cake was for my daughter and to bring it out with the candles in it after dinner. The hostess followed me back to my table so she was sure to talk to the right server about the right table/party.  Dinner came and went. It was all very good, but expensive, which is expected there. Then the bill came, and I tipped about 25% because I appreciated the extra trouble of them letting me bring in my own cake, etc.  But after the server took my money, we never saw him again - and no one ever brought out her cake!! NOTHING!! After we waited a while and realized it wasn't happening, we decided to leave. When I stopped at the front and explained what happened (or what didn't happen) and asked for my cake back, the man at the counter casually handed it back without making any effort to make the situation right!!!  I was so disappointed and felt so bad for my daughter to not get the the birthday fun I thought I had set up for her.  Bad job, Brandon and Cheesecake Factory. You really dropped the ball.  The next day I wanted to complete the online survey about my experience, but realized too late that having the receipt handy is required, and I didn't have it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=80

The shortcake was very hard and cold, not fresh whatsoever. On the top of the shortcake their was a sugar crust made with raw sugar. The strawberries were the best thing about this dessert.

Staff is always friendly and if something isn't right, they will make it right with no questions asked. They can substitute just about anything on the menu as well.

Our server was less than par - he waited on every table except for ours for nearly 10 minutes before he even offered to take our drink order. When we finally got to order 20 minutes later it took an additional 25 minutes to get our food. No where in that time did our server check on us to see if we wanted refills and it wasn't until the table 6in away needed boxes did our server even check in on us. Once we got our food we were ready to go. We asked for our food to be boxed (as most other Cheesecake Factory's will box it for you and he had just boxed the couple's food next to us 10 minutes prior) he threw down 3 boxes (for whatever reason, there were only two plates on our toddler sized table) and when we asked for the check it took an additional 10 minutes to get and another 10 to have picked up.

This was nice as we don't usually wait, just a habit.  Our waitress took our drink orders and gave us some time to wait for the rest of our party. When she brought our drinks she tried to drop them off and run, but I caught her and ordered an appetizer. The spinach, artichoke cheese dip was typical, nothing to rave about.  Our party arrived and her drink order was taken and delivered. When our waitress came to take our order we had been catching up and my friend hadn't gotten a chance to look at the menu so she asked if our could be put in while she took a moment to look.  The waitress walked away and I actually caught her rolling her eyes with a look of disgust on her face!  When my friend had gotten a chance to decide she called her over and gave her the order. Our order that was put in about 5 minutes earlier than hers arrived almost 5 minutes after hers.  I ordered a vegan club salad, it was great.  My husband ordered the lemon herb chicken, it was so overboard on the lemon that was all he could taste. Most definitely not worth his money.  My friend ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was so tough she had to borrow my husband's steak knife to cut it.  All in all we waited longer than was necessary but we are OK with that as we were relaxing and enjoying each other's company. The waitress must of been having a bad day, but put on a smile and wasn't rude to our faces.

Ivan T.,"El Paso, TX",47,64,46,5.0,7/22/2014,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. It was love at first bite for my partner and I, and we have made it a must in every trip we have made to Phoenix. - The ambiance is very nice with subdued lighting and nice background music. Staff was always been very attentive and corteous. - Portions are generous and packed with flavor (so far I have only ordered something I didn't fully like). This last time I got the Chicken Bellagio and my partner got the Pasta Carbonara, which were LIFE giving. We had plenty of left overs to prolong our Cheesecake Factory reverie the next day. - the cheesecakes are always fantastic. I got the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake and my partner got the Adam's Peanut Butter cup cheesecake. Very decadent and rich in consistency. The prices are a bit high, but it's the CF. You don't go to be all dietetic and stingy. All in all it has become one of the best chain restaurants I have ever visited.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=120
M G.,"Beaumont, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/25/2016,"I was very hunrgy and so my family and I decided to go to Cheesecake factory. We like that they have a big menu and that the desserts are huge. But unfortunately, we ended up not having much fun at all. On a Tuesday night, we arrived at 7pm and after only 10 min., were seated at a booth, which we had requested. But the booth was so dimly lit that I could't read my menu! Literally... So after a couple of minutes I asked the waitress if we could change seats and she said if I wanted to do that I would have to get up and ask the hostess myself... to which I replied no. I do not have to get up- I have a waitress who can ask her on my behalf. She rolled her eyes and suggested that if I could;t see I should use my iPhone instead... really? How rude, I thought. Why can;t she just help me instead of trying to be sarcastic? Then the manager comes over and asks me if I would prefer a seat in the middle of the room- with hard chairs. I told him no because our family had just spent 4 hrs on bleachers at the baseball game, so I needed a more comfortable seat. (Not to mention the fact that we specifically asked for a booth from the begging and there are other booths with lights) So he told me that there was no other table. That was simply not true, as there were other tables which had light. There was no sense talking to them. The noise level was really high so I felt like they could't really hear me- or else were;t trying. I was wanting them to help me, but they were too busy to care. They basically said take it or leave it. I ended up using my iPhone and letting the kids eat... I drank water since I had lost my appetite. It's hard to want to to eat drink and be merry when you are treated like you don;t belong. I did;t bother getting drinks, or dessert, since I just wanted to leave asap.  I also tried not to be upset with the fact that the waitress barely came to our table and we had to flag her down for napkins, forks, water, ranch, bread... It was exhausting. We left disappointed. I reluctantly left a tip even though I felt like writing her a note on how to treat your fellow man. But I decided that nothing I would say could change their rude, insensitive demeanor. After all, it was such a small request and they made such a big deal out of it. Apparently business is so good that they don't have to treat customers with respect.  After that experience, I doubt I'll be back anytime soon... but that's OK... I doubt they'll miss me...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=120

Stephanie S.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,48,1,5.0,12/16/2016,"To be honest I used to live off the best menu item which was the juicy portabella mushroom burger, I would pick it up for lunch at least 3x per week, in addition to going there for dinner....a total addiction until they took it off the menu. That's ok, I needed a change. I love the Thai lettuce wraps with peanut dressing that's another serious addiction. The sweet Hawaiian salad tastes like candy. All of the salads are among the best salads you can get anywhere. The Chicken Marsala is fantastic. The simple four cheese pasta is crack. Oh the salmon rice dish with a light lemon sauce will fill you up yet you'll feel good. Those suggested pasta dishes are really good. Steak and ribs was ok, yet I order that at a stake house. Fish and chips yummy. Burgers are fantastic. The size of the burrito reminds you of your first born child. So again, I'll admit when I lived down the street at the Biltmore Estates I went here for dinner at least 4x per week at my sons request.

The parking situation is horrible and you have to remember to get validated. I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken and the noodles just weren't cooked right.

No. Think of a place that you go for service where is acceptable to be acknowledged after 10 minutes when is not busy as fuck. This place was no where near busy. We are then greeted by Giovanni who was plenty friendly, but not a great waiter. After taking our order we advised that we were on a break from work so we would like the check immediately. We received our check last.  Our food arrived with 20 minutes to spare from our break. He said that he would bring to go boxes with our order. Not only did we never get a to go box, but we had to borrow one of there mother fucking napkins to bring our food with us.

Rebecca D.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,119,38,5.0,9/21/2016,Fantastic happy hour spot. Going to the Cheesecake Factory for happy hour is a real weekday treat. From 4 to 6 Monday through Friday you can enjoy drinks and appetizers for $5 each or so. I like the Mojito and the Cosmo too. My husband has had the pink lemonade drink and enjoys that a lot. The real draw here is the food. You can order many of their appetizers which usually run $10-$13 for around $5. The best part is the happy hour burger that my husband always orders. Unlike most places that only have sliders this is a full size burger and fries can be ordered with it for a dollar or two more. He loves it as he can have an adult beverage and a burger and fries for like $12. I enjoy several of the appetizers especially the shrimp spring rolls and the avocado egg rolls. There are other things on the menu I am tempted to try but I keep going back to my favorites.

In terms of parking, it's generally easy in the ""token"" lot right in front of the restaurant (2 hours free). If you are going at a busy time, there is additional free parking at the back of the shopping center only a few minutes walk away. There is also valet parking. In terms of the wait, you might experience one depending on when you go. It's a popular place. We try to go just before the busy hours (e.g. 11:45 on a weekend) so we haven't waited more than ten minutes. However, when we leave around 1pm, I can see that there is probably a 15-20 minute wait.

It was either between this place and Red Devil and I wish we just would have went to Red Devil instead. They do not take reservations but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the wait was non-existent on this night and we were seated right away. The waiter took our drink orders and my sister was the only one that didn't want lemon in her drink and he was kinda rude about that, something about making his job more difficult or something but whatever. The menu is huge and they have a Skinnylicious menu that features light menu items if you are watching your weight.  Pretty much anything that you could want is on the menu; italian, asian, american, etc. and let's not forget that cheesecake! The cheesecake is the one item where you cannot go wrong. OMG Red Velvet layer cheesecake is 7.95 a slice as they are all aptly priced but it is a huge slice enough for two people.  The mango passion tea is great as were their mixed drinks which are $9.25++ I got the veggie burger which was okay, nothing groundbreaking in flavor or toppings, sauces etc. The fries were a bit disappointing and the food presentation was pretty disappointing and lackluster. My mom got a turkey burger that was incredibly greasy and she was not happy with it. She asked the waiter if he was sure if it was a turkey burger and he assured her it was but again, did not get her something else or offer to take it off of the bill. So somewhat disappointing considering this is Mother's Day and I wanted my mom to at least enjoy her meal. Summary: Food so-so-may change on a variable basis, Service-abyssmal, we never even got our water glasses refilled, another waitress stepped on my sister's foot but refused to move in a timely manner.

Wanted to order something eat that we could share while having our cocktails.  The waitress could not recommend or guarantee anything that was gluten free.  So I just ate all the free bread and butter they brought and then we ordered dessert.  He got the ice cream sundae and I had a lemoncello raspberry cheesecake or something like that.  The waitress recommended it.  It wasn't very good at all.  I only ate a few bites because I didn't want to waste eating that many calories on something not so tasty. With three cocktails (A mojito for me and 2 gin and tonics for him), the sundae and slice of cheesecake, with tip was $45).  I think that is quite a bit. The best part was the free bread, no joke.  Service was pretty horrid as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=160

I remember reading in Mens Health that this restaurant serves up a heavy portion, high caloric fatty foods. But the cheesecake on the marquee drew me in. I was dining with my daughter and have a tendency to try to fatten up my kids, to no avail and to be fair there is a SkinnyLicious Menu. I ordered up the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Shrimp and chicken sauteed with onions, tomato and peppers in a very spicy Cajun sauce on top of fresh linguine. $17. Certainly a heavy plate, delicious and took home half of it for someone else in the family. My drink was a Stella Artois 22 oz. $7.25 The kid got a marinara pasta. $11.50 We came for the cheesecake. Kahlua cocoa coffee $7. and the fresh strawberry  $7.50. I ate half of mine. It was so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=160
Noor B.,"Phoenix, AZ",124,428,53,3.0,1/3/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is such a mixed bag of good and bad. There's almost always a wait if you have a party larger than 2, even if the restaurant is empty. I don't know if they are understaffed or if there are tons many people visiting on a daily basis. Either way, call ahead if possible. This particular location has a valet, but you can easily park around the mall and walk a couple minutes if you want to save a few bucks. Servers are friendly and attentive. Restaurant is nice, big, clean - kind of reminds me of a Vegas casino. I really like the rye bread - it's soft and sweet. White bean hummus is a nice twist on classic hummus, although I think the accompanying bread was a bit stale. No biggie. I just wish I had ordered a different entree. I got the Chinese chicken salad, which is a stupid choice given their huge menu of American and European dishes. The salad tasted like the Asian chicken salad from Wendy's, but with a bunch of rice noodles on top. Sure, it's a big salad, but not worth the $14.50 I paid for it. Like I said, my own fault - order at your own risk! The crispy chicken costoletta was actually good. Once again, big portion, and the chicken was really nice. Mashed potatoes seemed a bit tired, and the asparagus was nothing fancy. Still, it was good, and I wouldn't mind ordering it in the future. I think the food here is good, not outstanding, and I do think it's overpriced.

Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1181,306,5.0,1/12/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, and cannot say enough good things about them!  I've never been to this specific location before, but have been to a few others in the valley, and I love it every single time I go.  Weather its for lunch or dinner, with family, friends or coworkers, this place hits the spot every single time. Their menu is huge, and awesome!  TONS of great food to choose from. Dinners, lunches, and it all tastes so good!  MMM.  Lunch specials, dinners, deserts you can find everything on their huge menu.  The restaurant is quite large as well so seating is plentiful.   Today I went with my coworker during lunch, and we both walked out so full!  We got pasta lunch specials, and it was Delicious.  We were seated within a few minutes of entering, and our waitress greeted us and took our order.  She brought out bread which was hot and tasty, which we devoured.  Drinks were always filled, and we were in and out in a little more then an hour.  I got the spagetti with meat sauce, and the lunch sized one was HUGE.  I will be having leftovers for dinner, trust me! I will be returning here in the future, trust me.  Menu and food is amazing, love the atmosphere, etc.   I will say, on a side note the parking here has gotten WORSE over past few years.  I will not blame Cheesecake factory because its not their private lot, but its bad.  When I first started coming to this district, parking was open and free, with some valet service.  Then, one day, I came here last year to eat, and it was all chopped up into different pay lots.  the first lots a valet, the next lot is all token pay parking, theirs a pay parking structure in the back, and tons of ""15 minute to go"" parking around the perimeter of the center.  UM, this is a nightmare to navigate!  There's ""free"" parking but they shove you way in the back on the ""north"" side of the lot and you would spend at least 15 minutes walking to cheesecake factory if you were to have parked on that side of the mall. My advice?  Either circle 3 million times, or just drop your car off in the token paying lot down the way.  I think Cheesecake factory may even validate, but that's my thoughts...

Ken L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,10,1,5.0,12/24/2014,"The other day, i took my holiday guests to share dinner at yourBiltmore location. My friends had arrived from Paris and were famished. I chose your establishment because of the extensive selection of menu items and the quality of food. It was approximately 5pm and we decided to enjoy our meal on the patio where it was relatively quiet.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted promptly and seated immediately. I was concerned because I didn't see anyone else eating on the patio which typically means the server sometimes can forget they have people outside. Our table was clean, music was at an acceptable level, the sunscreens were pulled down and everything seemed perfect, then...our waitress arrived and introduced herself as Nikea. At that precise moment, our experience began to change.  Granted, had been shopping all day. My guests were experiencing jet lag from their travels. Their English is not that great which required translation and patience just to get through the menu. The four of us were hungry, but we just couldn't believe nor did we ever expect what happened next. Nikea created an environment which made us feel as though we were being welcomed in her own home. Not once did we ever feel rushed nor did we feel like red headed step children for sitting on the patio. She had other tables on the inside  but somehow knew when we needed drinks or her assistance. She made reasonable suggestions and was present for our entire meal.  Although we had just met, she created an atmosphere in which I felt as though I had known her for quite some time. One might ask what exactly did she do?  Everything. Absolutely everything was perfect and exceeded my own expectations this making taking our dining experience from perfect to a remarkably extraordinary epic experience! If she isn't part of your training crew, I would highly recommend you consider making her one. Her mannerisms, attentiveness and overall professionalism was superb, but it was her personality which boosted her A game and placed a personal touch on our experience. I truly hope you take the time to share this with her. Thank you Nikea for a remarkably relaxing and memorable dining experience. Entertains guests from foreign countries who have limited knowledge of the English language is very exhausting and sometimes stressful. Thank you for making this an amazing dinner for me and my guests.  And if you are reading this to her, I hope you give her a great big hug for me right now.

They're insane. Like, not even the hulk could finish a plate of pasta from here.

The food is always about the same (good), the line always long (hour), and the service is always mediocre ( too busy to be attentive, professional enough not to make it an issue).

There were a few parties waiting outside too.  40 minutes have passed, we came inside and checked to see the status of where our name was. Apparently our pager was dead, they called our name 10-15 minutes ago. We were put off by the manager/supervisor's attitude, he was really rude.  He made it seem like it was our fault we didn't hear our names called because we were standing right outside and that our pager was dead. I saw that they were calling names inside and outside, but the only called outside every other time.  This kind customer service at the beginning set the mood for the evening...not fun. We always try to have a positive attitude, but it was kind of sad when someone that is representing the restaurant is not welcoming, we didn't really want to be there anymore. We stayed though because we are not rude.  They did seat us about a minute after. Our waiter was awkward too, but he tried.

Cory M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,6,,1.0,5/3/2015,"Our server Georgina, took our drink orders and left. When she returned, she had forgotten to bring a tea for one of our party. Moments later, holding a tray with a cleaning rag on it, she dropped the tray just beside me and splashed both myself, and my friend sitting next to me. I absorbed most of the splatter, in my mouth, left eye, and face. She fortunately was only splashed on her body and hand. Georgina didn't even say anything to us, but picked up the tray and kept going. After a few moments of waiting, I got up and went to the restroom to clean myself off, since I didn't even have a place setting or napkin at the table. On the way back, I stopped and asked to speak with a manager. A young man with curly hair, and square framed glasses was brought to me and didn't give me his name. I told him our situation, and what had happened. I told him I could not only smell, but also taste the cleaning solution that had been on the rag and tray. At first I asked if it was bleach based, and he assured me it wasn't. Then he said he'd talk to our server, and left things at that by turning around to talk to the hostesses. Clearly, I was dismissed. So I returned to the table, disgusted, upset, and smelling of cleaning solution. My appetite was ruined at this point, so I choose not to order anything. Having chemicals splashed into your mouth, even a few droplets, will do that to a person. At this point, our friend STILL hadn't received his iced tea. We flagged down a passing server and asked her if she could bring it for him. She went back, and came out with the wrong tea. Now in this, I say it wasn't really her fault. She wasn't our server, and didn't know what type he had asked for. Correcting that issue was minor. Next up, comes our long wait for our orders to be brought out. Georgina hasn't been back to our table for at least 15 minutes at this point. Another young man stopped and dropped one basket of bread and a small dish with 4 butter pats, to serve a group of 7. Another long wait, and the table next to us, who were seated after us, and ordered after us, gets their meals. At this point, my left eye was feeling irritated, and I went to flush it out in the men's room with water as best I could. When I returned to the table, our orders were just coming out. And my roommates order was wrong. He had ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp, and NO asparagus. And he got asparagus mixed into all his noodles. At this point, he notified the food runner who had brought his dish that it was wrong. The young man said sorry, and then walked away without offering to replace or fix the order. he decided to just pick out the asparagus, and deal with it since he was hungry, and didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes. At this point, Georgina has appeared at our table 4 times total. While refilling glassing, she is reaching directly in front of my roommates mothers face, my face, and our friend seated on the other side of the booth. No excuse me, no words at all, and STILL no apology from her for the splashing. While my friends ate, I again went to the restroom to flush my eye. I again stopped to speak with the manager from earlier, and asked him for the name of the chemical used for cleaning. He immediately told me that ""I already told you sir that we do not use bleach products here."" He furthermore told me that he had spoken to our server, and she said she didn't have any cleaning solution or rags with her when she dropped her tray. Outright calling me a liar as I see things. Please take into account, from the beginning I told the manager I didn't want anything, and wasn't asking for free meals, or drinks, or desert etc. I simply wanted the name of the chemicals used, so that I could give that information to a doctor if I felt the need to seek out treatment. He informed me that they didn't use chemicals for cleaning, and then said they used a sanitation solution. I'm sorry, but that would be a chemical. I pointed that out, and told him I was very upset with how this had all been handled. I made it clear again, that I wasn't looking for anything from him, except the name of the chemical. He asked if there was anything he could do to make my evening better, covering my meal or anything. I once more told him that I had chosen NOT to eat, after getting splashed and having that rancid taste of chemicals in my mouth. He then said he would get me the name of the solution used, after my having exhausted every other avenue, and telling him I would be contacting the corporate office. At this point, I told him I was done with the conversation, and wanted nothing more to do with him, as he clearly didn't care about the situation. The rest of our evening was spent with little service from Georgina. She had come and taken a desert order from our group while I was speaking with the manager, without even asking if I had wanted anything. Granted, I didn't. She didn't speak a word to me the entire time after the first complaint, and treated",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=220

Debi C.,"Gilbert, AZ",18,45,3,1.0,2/27/2014,"I was having lunch today with two business executives.  I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad which seemed simple enough. When it was served I began to eat it and noticed there was no chicken.  I politely asked if I had ordered wrong and she said ""no"" the chicken might be on the bottom. I checked, no chicken.

Tam F.,"San Ramon, CA",489,1397,253,3.0,6/9/2009,"I went to Phoenix to spend time with my Grandmother. She is going to be 86 this year and has been having a bunch of health problems so when I told her I would be coming to town, she asked if I would take her to see her financial planner who works in this area. He is great and often drives all the way to Sun City West to see her or they conduct business over the phone and email. Since it is schlep for my mom to do this, I was happy to take her. We had an appointment around 1:15 and since Gram moves a bit slower than either of us expected, our plan to have lunch before the appointment didn't work out so we had lunch afterward. This is how we ended up at CF. She was starving and knew they had a lot of options and she didn't feel like Miracle Mile (and I knew I could eat at the one in Arrowhead) Cheesecake Factory is CF. I know now that I like their burgers and I love their garden salad. It is full of great veggies like shredded zuchini and beets. Gram had the meatloaf and ate about 3/4 and then decided it wasn't as good as it used to be. I refused to let her send it back (one of her favorite things to do-eat more than half and then complain so she gets either a comped meal or another meal that she takes home for another time)-yes,I am outing her trick and she knows I am on to her.... She let me pay because I didn't let her send her food back. Luckily and our waitress was a doll who totally got it. She was from San Jose so we had a good time chatting about the Bay Area and the differences between here and there.  The reason why I am not giving this location 4 stars is because the slice of cheesecake we ordered had some nasty strawberries on it. I have a good taster and when I bit into one it was like biting into an overly acidic chemical taste. I told the waitress and she brought us a plain slice. The waitress told the manager who came over to tell me that NO ONE had ever complained about the strawberries before. I told him to taste one and he looked at me like I was crazy. A few minutes later, our waitress came to me to tell me that the manager did taste the strawberries and that I was right -DUH. Had he come back to tell me this himself, he would have bumped up the star rating in service...

Jennifer G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,1/19/2011,"I can't review the food here because we never got seated! Knowing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, my sister called Saturday afternoon to find out how long it would take a party of 14 to be seated that night. The hostess told her she'd take the name, asked my sister to call 20 minutes ahead to let her know we were on our way and our table would be ready shortly after we arrived, if not when we got there. Sounds perfect right? Not so much.  We called them as requested and were told our table would be ready when we arrived. When we arrived about 15 minutes later, we were told they were running approximately 20 minutes behind. Not a huge deal, being Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night. After 30 minutes, we asked again about being seated and were told that they were waiting for their large table to be vacated by a party who'd been there for 2 hours. Of course... who doesn't go to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 4:00? Another twenty minutes goes by and again, we speak to the hostess station, who tells us the table just ordered dessert. At this point, it becomes pretty apparent we've been lied to. Finally after waiting for more than an hour and 15 minutes for a supposed reservation with two pregnant women, a diabetic and two antsy toddlers, we decided to leave.  I have no problem with Cheesecake Factory not taking reservations. I think it's ridiculous, but it's publicized, so we dealt with it the best way we could.

There were about 10 of us in our group, and before we ordered we apologized to our waitress for needing separate checks. I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first.  I have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue.  The other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side.  Well, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless.  As for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much. I hope for the rest of my life I never step foot in one again.

Husband's left side including wheels and batteries were drenched. Waitress did not initially apologize but stated, ""It's just a spill.""

Even worse; two years ago a waiter dropped a tray of drinks on my son at the same place,and another customer who was sitting at a table next to us was also drenched.

Dinner wise, however, the portions are difficult to finish for the average appetite, but I tend to gravitate toward their small plates menu and order a couple of things off of that.  I also enjoy their Thai Chicken lettuce wraps.  It's a good place to go if you have a bunch of people who like a variety of things or just can't decide.

Andi R.,"Los Angeles, CA",274,71,,1.0,3/24/2010,"Before I jump into this review, let me just preface it by saying that I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Jersey Mike's and Yogurtland excluded). And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants.  Right off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once.  I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta.  When the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory.

I've actually been over-serviced at multiple cheesecake locations, which I guess is better than not getting enough.  On NYE, we went here for Cheesecake, drinks and the free champagne toast; we had two almost identical servers who clearly didn't communicate, and the two of us wound up with four classes of bubbly instead of two.

Hate the wait and lack of reservations.  The Biltmore Hotel called in a reservation for us for a table of 8 for 6:30pm on Sunday.  It wasn't a reservation, nor a pseudo reservation, we ended up being seated at 6:50 pm.  If you don't get there (any of the restaurants early, before 5pm, expect a wait.) I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps, $15, extremely yummy and enough to share with 5 others and chicken and biscuits, $21, enough for 3 meals.  The biscuits are airy like Marie Callenders corn bread, I got 3 chicken breasts and plenty of gravy.  Friends ordered the Steak Diane, excellent mushrooms, miso salmon, shepards pie, just to name a few.  Everything was so good. The downside of our experience at this restaurant was the ordeal of no reservation and our waiter was inattentive, we had to ask for our drinks and appy's.  Had to ask the manager to find out what was going on with our waitstaff and order.  Hopefully, this was not the norm at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=260

Another 20 minutes goes by and we tracked down the manager. He apologized and said he would have the check right out to us. At 7:30, an hour and a half AFTER we asked for our check the first time, we had to walk up to the front, wait in line, and ask the manager AGAIN for our check. He apologized and brought it right out. Instead of offering to comp the meal, or ANYTHING, he took the coffee off. Really? Oh thank you for saving me $2.95. I waited an hour and a half to pay you guys. Needless to say, we left a $0 tip.

We are also huge fans of The Big Bang Theory, and since Penny works there, and Sheldon will actually eat there, how bad could it be? Analysis: not *bad*, just decidedly mediocre. I had the fish and chips. The fish was bland and overcooked, and the fries were pretty terrible. The zucchini small plate/app we had was flavorful and the zucchini was not fried to mush. The ranch it came with had a nice garlic zing to it. Hubby had the veggie quesadilla (a breakfast item, technically) and described it as ""fine"" but otherwise unremarkable. Sorry, Penny.

I'm not really sure how a kitchen can specialize in every cuisine known to man but they manage to pull it off somehow.

It has an Oreo crust, chocolate chips throughout and on the top, and a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side. Then they introduced the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake and I'm like, seriously, Cheesecake Factory? It has a moist, red velvet cake surrounded by layers of cheesecake. It also has a cream cheese frosting with what tastes like white chocolate shavings in the frosting. I came here yesterday with the excuse of validating my parking token (as my husband puts it, yeah right!).

The menus are a bit much with all that advertisements in them. The menu is eclectic, but I definitely think the prices are borderline gouging.  The portions are big, that is correct. But, chicken is cheap, and a plate of it with mash and gravy for $16 is a bit much.  The cheesecakes are delicious, all though we were a bit bummed to find out that the cheesecake is not made in house. My friends first choice was said to be unavailable because it was frozen. That means the place is not a Cheesecake Factory, but merely a Cheesecake Depot, where the real factory trucks in the baked goodies.  I strongly feel this place is WAY overpriced for what it offered.

I know it sounds weird, but really bothered me. Another one of my big pet peeves, if you are wanting to remove a plate from the table and I have a utensil still on it, ask me to grab it off or just bring me a new one. DO NOT remove it yourself and place on the table, ick! She also grabbed my butter wrapper off my plate touching my bread. Just leave me a lone lady, stop touching all my s***! I felt like she wanted to pop a squat with us and have girl talk. Back off.  The food came, it was alright. I started with a side salad and friend for fried artichoke hearts. My salad clearly had been pre made and sitting in a cooler for hours, as the lettuce was brown and over dressed. The artichokes were good and the dipping sauce it came with was yummy.

I was hungry one night and stopped in for a quick bite on December 4th. I've always enjoyed their pineapple Mojitos  and the menu variety . I sat at a small table in the bar area. It was literally 5 mins before I was even acknowledged (I timed it)! Then menus were haphazardly dropped on the table. I wasn't offered water and warm bread came out 5 mins later. Meanwhile, the servers were congregating, laughing and joking in the back station, which was clearly visible from my table. I finally ordered a chicken Marsala and that took another 20 mins (I also timed that), to which I jokingly replied to my server (a young, bald AfricanAmerican server with large diamond earrings) ""I thought that you forgot about me?"" His curt reply was ""It's gotta cook!""....I probably won't go back to Cheesecake Factory based on this last visit, even though it is across from where I live, even if I am craving a pineapple Mojito.

Seriously, Ive been to a Cheesecake Factory for birthday parties... or in malls. But I had to rate this place, bc the waiter was off the charts one of the best I have ever, yep! ever had... I told him I didnt have much of an appetite, as I mulled the book of a menu over and over and kept sending him away and my 'wanting only dessert friend' now wanted some orange chicken too... and bread...and a side salad.. geesh.. how can a 90lb girl want so much food? ... I ended up with a chicken sandwiche and soup... none of which was earth shattering... but I loved the waiter... we had fun with the fact that the seemingly 'we never get out much' peeps next to us didnt know how to act in a restaurant...and he brought us a piece of decadent red velvet cheese cake and even wrote in cursive a cute little note for me and my friend.. and I will leave it at that:-) Score for the factory.. compliments of the waiter...

Funny thing is I've had their cheesecake maybe about two times, because with the ridiculously large portions would I really have any room?  And if you're looking to totally WRECK your diet, this is your place - there's hardly anything healthy on the menu (but they did just start a lite salad menu).  My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the sliders.  Grilled shrimp club, BBQ chicken pizza, blackened chicken sandwich,  chicken chipotle pasta, chicken romano, and chicken madeira are all REALLY good.  I guess I like chicken, huh?

You get a metric ton of food for the price (I brought approx. 2/3 of my club sandwich home with me and my puppy couldn't be happier, plus, I couldn't begin to eat all the fries). No room for cheesecake on this visit or I would tossing and turning at my desk all afternoon. I don't think the food is really the point with Cheesecake Factory. The lunch was nice, the food tasted good, and the atmosphere was really very pleasant. The service was good, prompt, attentive and friendly. There just isn't anything that stands out about Cheesecake factory to make me want to give them more than an average rating.

But I have to say that, over time, I've warmed to this conglomerate - even as I subsequentyly learned that eating here regularly might kill me.     The staff has settled in and mostly toned it down, and now our entire family revolves through CF's front door with confidence, and suspiciously early for dinner, to avoid waiting room rigor mortis.  Overall food preparation is at least one notch below Houston's across the street and one notch above adjacent CPK, which is more impressive than it sounds considering the legendary breadth of Cheesecake's menu.    It's all respectably prepared, if fattening, and often quite good.  I like the fish tacos (standard fish but massive fixins) and the portabella and asparagus omelette. Mom gravitates towards sublime corn tamale cakes, and Chris is seduced by a salad presented in two huge conical mounds he likes to call ""Dolly Parton"".   There's an item or two on this menu to pique anyone's interest, and while the Factory probably wont serve up your best meal ever (unless you dont get out much), a truly disappointing meal here is rarer than Steak tartare. Portions are large and we almost always pass on dessert.  Not the kind of restaurant to whip out an engagement ring in (this is a Factory, after all), but a safe choice for the family, stargazing (Suns opponents staying at the Ritz eat here all the time), or a pre-movie dinner date.

I'm not much of a fan of chain restaurants, but I must say the decor and ambiance have been nice and the restaurant always clean.  On a past visit I had a Buffalo Chicken sandwich which is no longer on the menu...and probably with good reason. It was the sort of quality I'd expect from a fast food drive-thru, only a larger portion and served on a plate. This time, I had the Cuban Sandwich with a Green Salad side. The sandwich wasn't bad, just not memorable. The portion was plenty for lunch and some to take home. My friend had the equivalent of Chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti (don't see it currently listed on their website menu) which he downed in no time, despite the large portion. At the server's recommendation, we shared the Hershey®'s Chocolate Bar Cheesecake, which was fresh and flavorful.  The second server (the first one's shift had ended) was late in bringing some water I'd asked for. While I wasn't concerned about it, he noticed his own service was too slow and he promised to ""make it up"" to me. Not sure what that meant and I never saw any benefit.  While the portions were more than ample, I'm not sure the prices are in line for the quality being offered. Two lunch entrees with nonalcoholic beverages and one dessert came to about $50.00.

I wanted to order cheese cake but was stuffed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200

Chris C.,"St. Louis, MI",0,9,,1.0,2/24/2015,"Went here last night with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. I ordered the Herb Encrusted Salmon and it was quite delicious. However, herb encrusted salmon does not taste quite as good when you're throwing it up. Currently sitting in the doctors office waiting for meds over a bad case of food poisoning. Thanks Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200
Becky V.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,19,,5.0,1/23/2015,"I have gone to this specific location many times, but I have never had such great service as I did on my most recent visit. Our waiter was Tim and he was fantastic (the main reason why I wrote this review). He was funny, attentive and, personable. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and, like always, was happy with the dish. If I was able to give Tim a raise, I would- he definitely deserves it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200
Anthony N.,"Chicago, IL",365,291,189,3.0,8/24/2013,"Huge menu leaves something for everyone.  Prices can get up there, even for seemingly simple dishes. The good thing is that most items (even salads and sandwiches) will get you multiple servings unless you're super hungry. I'm a fan of their rye bread. People think I'm weird when I compare other calamari to the one that's served here.  That said, I wonder how much of the food is actually prepared fresh from scratch. A lot of the dishes are drenched in salt. My friend couldn't eat his pasta because it was so salty.  Service was slow and ""meh"" at best. Cheesecake is good for its convenience and familiarity. In the future, I'd rather spend the same money or less at a local restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200
Luca C.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,209,3,2.0,10/10/2013,"The people were nice but the food was really hit or miss. The appetizers were sloppy, most things were greasy and started falling apart if that makes sense. The pizza was soggy and overly cheesed. The burger came in over cooked. Maybe we should have  just stuck with the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200
Rosalind C.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,137,60,4.0,6/22/2011,"I have been eating at the Cheesecake Factory for years and no matter what city or state I'm in I can always count on them for consistently good food!  I decided to try this location out for my birthday meal since I was craving their chicken chipotle pasta. We started out with the standard bread basket and I had a strawberry lemonade. Our server was crazy busy but he still took care of us for the most part. My chicken chipotle pasta that I also add shrimp too was so delish the sauce is a little creamy but has a kick to it from the chipotle flavoring. The asparagus, tortilla chips, chicken and shrimp  just work perfectly with the sauce and the penne pasta! This is def. my go to entree at the Cheesecake Factory. For dessert since I'm not a fan of cheesecake I went for the carrot cake and it was everything I wanted and more! Moist delicious cake with nuts, raisins and carrots and just enough frosting.  I have also met my girls at this location several times for happy hour and they have an awesome menu menu with $5 appetizers and drink specials! And the portions are huge 1 appetizer can serve as a meal or can be shared easily.  Cheesecake Factory never disappoints, I will always be a fan :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200
Nancy S.,"Novato, CA",312,191,130,5.0,4/4/2014,I do love cheesecake!  Those two words should not be combined to create a word to describe such deliciousness...but I will not allow such transgressions to distract from my indulgences!  The CF does such an excellent job...I should have ordered two to go.  The red velvet is superb...I'm now wearing it permanently on bum.  Yes...once on my lips and bam...there it is!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200
Jacqueline M.,"FORT HUACHUCA, AZ",38,45,1,3.0,7/1/2013,This is a nice location. We were seated quickly and our food was quick to come out.  We sat in a booth that was like sitting on a bench. We noticed the other booths were well padded. I don't know if this was intentional but it was uncomfortable after about 30 minutes and we ended up getting our meals to go. That was a definite draw back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200
ronnie g.,"Phoenix, AZ",96,13,1,2.0,7/12/2014,"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years now and it's become my favorite restaurant. This location, however, is my least favorite. I went in for dinner one night and had Michelle C as a server and it just seemed like she was in a bad mood and didn't want to be there that night. I'll take my business elsewhere thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200
Denise L.,"Rochester, MN",6,32,,4.0,12/13/2015,"The Thai Glazed Salmon and Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp are both out-of-this-world delicious! I would have given this 5 stars if our server had been even 1 star. While he started out acceptable, he left us sitting for 20 minutes after he took our credit cards. We could see him tending to other tables, but he never came back. We finally gathered up our leftover and went to the front desk to get their assistance in retrieving our credit cards and receipts. This server experience will not keep me from returning to this restaurant because the food is awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200
S. Rose M.,"Glendale, AZ",0,16,9,4.0,6/23/2014,"Went here the day before my birthday with my boyfriend, everything was delicious as usual. Probably the first time I didnt have a vey nice server, he was kind of distant, but he was on top of things for the most part, normally the servers ask if we re celebrating something but he didnt, not did he ask if we wanted an appetizer. We sat for a long time, being a server I can see how that can be a little annoying but we did leave him a 35% tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-phoenix?start=200
