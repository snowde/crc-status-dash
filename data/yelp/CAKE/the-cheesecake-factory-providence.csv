Brendan H.,"Fall River, MA",38,16,,4.0,10/9/2017,"I have to say I am not big on chain restaurants so I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised.  The food was great, fried mac and cheese and pan seared artichoke was excellent and of course the cheesecake was to die for! Our waitress was also one of the most attentive, pleasant servers I have ever had which really made it such a great experience. I will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence
Anthony C.,"North Providence, RI",49,3,13,2.0,12/27/2017,"From the start.   No call ahead seating we waited in a cold area for 45 min The buzzer they wanted us to hold smelled like a dead animal.  It probably was not disinfect in weeks. We sat down in the middle of the restaurant and it is about 60 degrees.   I asked for heat and it just got colder the excuse is it is because the doors keep opening.  I would expect this from a small local tavern not at a million $ chain. Ordered food and they are out of 2 things I want.  I am here with a gift certificate.  We had to ask for water and a piece of bread for our meal.  So far I blame management not our server she is pleasant.   We ordered non alcoholic beverages.   15 min and the bread finally comes out no bread dish.   Our children are now waiting for food ours is here and getting cold.  I never eat without my children getting their food it is just plain rude. Food came out for all and it tastes great.  Portion is good.  We just went from a 1star to a 2 star because we are rating the entire restaurant experience, Not just the food.   Deserts are good but my Linda's Chocolate cake is frozen $9 per slice for a cake made in a warehouse not their kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence
Robert S.,"San Antonio, TX",4,29,6,1.0,11/24/2017,"Warning: do not visit here. If you do, it's buyer beware. Long wait times and questionable food safety.  Waited 90 minutes for seating after being told 45 minutes was the wait by the hostess. Warning, there is very limited indoor / outdoor seating.  Waited 10 minutes after seating for our drinks.  Waited another 70 minutes for food to arrive.  Yes, we made a poor decision waiting that long.  Then the worst started.  One meal of chicken Parmesan pizza had several hairs in it.  Another meal of chicken Parmesan pizza had pieces of plastic the size of a fingernail. Waitress stated that ""sometimes the kitchen just rips off the plastic on the frozen chicken and accidentally cook plastic into the food"".  After getting the bill, the waitress accidentally stepped on one of the children's feet (2 year old that just learned to walk). To be fair, little one was standing close by her side next to the table.  We had our meals comped. The Cheesecake Factory here is really far below standards. Our regular Cheesecake Factory in Texas never treats us that way in all our years of visiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence
JonSteph R.,"Attleboro, MA",14,12,,5.0,1/11/2018,I'm not big on chain restaurants but I make the exception for this place. FYI read a menu before going they have so many choices its like reading a book and will save you time choosing. I love the food but I usually get the same meal every time. The chicken marsala over pasta. I have not tried one better anywhere else yet. And no cheesecake will compare to theirs. Why you ask? I'm not even a fan of cheesecake. But theirs taste so good! And if you are full after your meal just take one to go. That is after you finally decide which kind you want.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence
Kristen S.,"Providence, RI",14,86,171,4.0,8/30/2017,"I work in the city so I end up eating here about once a month. I'm not usually a fan of chain type restaurants and don't really care for places that have super ridiculously large menus, and even though this restaurant fits into these categories, I've always received really friendly service and have enjoyed the food here.  The appetizers, entree salads, and dinner plates like Chicken Madeira and the Factory Meatloaf are my favorites, but I've never seen anyone not enjoy what they ordered. Who can resist taking a piece of cheesecake to go? There's dozens of flavors and varieties to choose from, so pick something that sounds good and enjoy!  Pro tip: Sit in the bar area between 4:00 - 6:00pm Monday-Thursday and ask for their special bar menu. They serve many of their appetizers and small plates for $5.95 each - which will save you a ton of money and let you sample some things you may not have tried before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence
Maryam A.,"Providence, RI",43,38,63,4.0,12/27/2017,"SHOUTOUT TO OUR SERVER BRYAN R! I've been to TCF more times than I can count, but last night's service prompted me to want to write a review. Our server was absolutely amazing. He was attentive, refilled our drinks numerous times and checked in on us every time he walked by. Usually the service here is okay and sometimes subpar, but last night we were very pleasantly surprised. Reason for the four stars is really their lack of appetizer options available last night. Also, the food is good, but not five stars good. We shared a fried cheese appetizer, since the stuffed mushrooms and  avocado egg-rolls we wanted were not available anymore for the night. It was good, nothing really memorable. I ordered the sausage and shrimp pasta and it was delicious. My friend had the four cheese pasta and the sauce for that dish was very tasty too. All in all a good place for lots of comfort food. Thanks again Bryan R for the great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence
Jennifer S.,"North Attleborough, MA",31,143,56,3.0,11/17/2017,"First, the wait is way too long. The table next to us were seated after us, yet were served bread before us. Not a big deal but that's a pet peeve of mine. The waitress is super friendly and checked on us a few times. I haven't had meat in months but decided to order my favorite, Chicken Constoletta. The asparagus was cold. Chicken was okay but nothing to write home about. I asked for extra lemon sauce for the chicken and I got it, thankfully because they never put enough on. Ok, so portion size is very large. It's enough for three meals. Restaurants should start offering half portion sizes with 25% to 30% discount. Many would choose the smaller portion which would be a higher profit. The best part of this evening, was the cheescake and staff singing to my daughter for her birthday, as well as the waitress. Otherwise the place is overpriced for subpar food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence
Mark M.,"Riverside, RI",113,45,52,4.0,11/12/2017,I've eaten here several times and never had a bad meal. It's a little pricey for a chain but I like the food.  We sat in a booth Wednesday night and the lighting was poor. We needed our phone lights to read the menu.  Our server was friendly and competent.  The fresh bread for the table was warm and delicious.  Our entrees were cooked perfect and seasoned well.  My espresso martini was off. Not sure what but not great.  Celebration cheesecake was more cake than cheese.  Bad decision.   Overall an enjoyable evening and we will return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence

Tiffany W.,"Providence, RI",218,145,208,2.0,9/6/2017,"I don't know why I keep coming back really. Sometimes we come here for last minute convenience. This is not the same standard they held themselves to say 10 years ago, and I just can't justify the visits anymore really. My go to item was always the chicken cobb salad. Most recently, the chicken on it wasn't the same as it used to be and was just ok. They actually removed my hunny's go to item (Kobe beef burger) from the menu.  On the visits over the past year, we have tried the salmon, burgers, pasta, and salads. All were somewhat below average and not as great as we remember. Service has somewhat become hit or miss too.

Linda S.,"RI, RI",6,47,164,5.0,5/10/2017,"SO SORRY, Cheesecake Factory that I have taken THIS long to write a review! I have been coming here for YEARS and I will continue to be a Loyal, grateful customer. I used to go to the one in Braintree, MA a lot since I lived in Boston at that time. It wouldn't be as packed as the one in Providence only b/c there were other restaurants around the vicinity. I also noticed that the price of the Well-Mannered Dirty Martini in Braintree is $11 and the one in Providence is $9! Score!... Since I moved back to Providence and it is my favorite 'tini! I always call ahead to see how long the wait is. It is the only one in Providence so you have to expect a long wait time, especially on the weekends. I love the fact that they're open late to 12:30AM on weekends! You have to imagine how the hosts & workers feel with hungry, hangry, rude customers complaining about waiting 10-20 minutes. They must be stressed out with all those customers hovering over the hostess stands. Give them a break! I LOVE their food. I've had almost everything on the menu, no Lie. My favorite though, is Steak Diane (med rare), stuffed mushrooms ( that I cannot find the recipe for), fried zucchini, shrimp scampi, bistro shrimp pasta, tuna tataki salad....Oh man, the list goes on! But FAVORITE FAVORITE is the Steak Diane b/c I always seem to get that. The flavor is sooo delicious and that sauce?! I can't get enough of it. I dip the steak into it...mix it into my mashed potatoes! I will have to go digging for my old pics to post and it's going to make me want some more! They should open up another location in RI b/c one Cheesecake Factory isn't enough!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence
Elizabeth S.,"Johnston, RI",147,74,199,3.0,5/27/2017,"Where does your daughter want to go after her college graduation? The Cheesecake Factory! We got there shortly after noon. Thankfully, there was no wait.  Our party of 4 ordered drinks and appetizers. The calimari was nice and tender, though I'm used to the garlic oil with banana peppers instead of tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Everyone was happy with their entrees. The menu is huge, so it would be difficult not to find something that you'd like. I went for the Shepard's Pie, which was quite good. My daughter got the 4 cheese pasta, son got chicken and biscuits, and ex got the  shrimp and chicken gumbo.  Portions were pretty large.

Mary P.,"Cranston, RI",6,188,269,3.0,11/16/2017,"Well I will admit the cheesecake is the best ever! At 8$ a slice it should be. Not impressed at all with this place though. Went in the afternoon for dessert and it was slow. They tried to seat us in a small cramped table near the bar next to a family with six kids. We asked to sit outside and the man said "" I will have to check to see if it's ok"". Ok with who? Since there were six open tables outside. He went to the front desk where the woman said hey I guess it's ok. Like really? Why wouldn't it be! Disappointed in that for sure which removed stars for my review. I wouldn't suggest sitting outside though to anyone reading this. It's loud and the traffic is to much for conversation. People passing by swearing and seriously some looked like they would steal your bags of given the chance. The cheesecake definitely is why they got three stars from me. Other than that no go because of the way we were treated. They said it was because in case they got busy but they were not busy so why can't you chose where to sit? Next time I will get it to go as I always have. My mistake. Two cold brew coffees and two slices of cake 35$.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence
Trinh V.,"Wallingford Center, Wallingford, CT",66,26,30,2.0,9/7/2017,"My boyfriend and I knew that the restaurant gets super packed during dinner hours so we decided to play some quick games at the Dave & Buster's nearby and then stop in for dinner at around 10:45-11:00 PM. And just like we thought, the place died down a bit that evening and we didn't have to wait for a table.  We were assigned a nice waitress but the service wasn't great at all. Asked for some extra napkins for a water spill on the table but never got them, our meal didn't arrive until well past an 1.5 hours later, our waters didn't get refilled until AFTER we finished eating, and we still had to wait a good some time after we finished eating, got the check, and paid for it.  I can expect this kind of service during super busy hours but I was hoping to NOT since there weren't that many people there that night.  I would have given the place a lower rating if it weren't for their Oreo cheesecake, perhaps the only thing going for the restaurant (I would hope).  Too long, didn't read: this restaurant is super hyped so it's not worth stopping in.

Elizabeth R.,"Providence, RI",86,107,120,3.0,4/10/2017,"It breaks my heart to give such a bad review to a restaurant I love but here is why... Saturday night, around 6pm, we are given an hour wait time. No big deal. We expected that so we killed an hour outside talking. When we finally get to our table, the girl waiting on us was very sweet. She was filling in for our server, Grace, who was on break. We ordered waters and then about 15 minutes later, our meals. He went with a bacon bacon burger with sweet potato fries. I ordered Parmesan herd crusted chicken with red skin garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  Our food took a normal amount of time for a busy Saturday night. Our food was exactly how we ordered it. I only ate one of the 3 pieces of chicken and a few bites of the mashed and also green beans. It was amazing but I just couldn't even dent it. Our server Grace was back at this time. She took my food to wrap it up and we ordered a huge piece of chocolate cake to split. It was delicious.  She brought my food back and also our bill. It was only about $50 for the both of us and he put his card in with the check. Our server ran the wrong check with his card despite giving us the proper check in the first place. She charged his card $130 for the table across from us. This wasn't a huge deal. Just a pain and a stupid mistake.  We fixed that and left. Later that evening when I got hope, I opened up my left overs thinking I'd have some more chicken but nope! The girl sent me home with the wrong left overs. So gross. Someone's half chewed asparagus was in the place of delicious meal. This was such a let down. I had 75% of my meal left. That's the main reason I am doing. This mediocre review. I thought of calling the restaurant and complaining but it was just a mistake.  I'll go back again and hopefully have a better experience so I can update this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence

The portions are absolutely absurd and overwhelming. The bread is delicious and the cheesecake, if you have room, is quite delicious but very heavy.

Chantee L.,"Attleboro, MA",3,27,86,3.0,9/25/2017,Came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and my goodness it was super packed! For just us two it was a 45 min to an hr wait! I'm assuming it must be busy due to the WaterFire event they got going on that night. We were starving and really wanted to try the place out so we decided to wait. One hr later we finally got called in and you already know what I ordered first... the drinks! Drinks were a bit pricey but packed a punch. The Tex Mex Eggrolls really saved the day because if it didn't taste so bomb I would still be pissed for having to wait this long for food! Entrees were okay. It wasn't the best but it wasn't bad either. It really filled me up with their huge portions.

Sulay E.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",115,1,1,1.0,10/20/2017,"I always have been a loyal customer to the brand, but this place has a great staff in regards to customer service. Even though that doesn't cut what I came for, the food was poorly prepared and was very tasteless. I ordered a chicken ceaser salad , and it tasted like a clove of garlic with cheese and the chicken was more like eating unseasoned cauliflower. My pregnant wife had a Cajun chicken seafood pasta that was so bland and noodles undercooked, now that is very unhealthy for any woman caring a child. They took the food off the ticket when she requested it from the waitress. I'm truly disappointed and this place needs to scrap the cooking staff. Another reason I gave it a star, is the silverware was set on the table and not even a napkin or anything to keep it from touching the table that numerous people have been sitting at.

Steve A.,"Riverside, RI",20,58,69,3.0,1/4/2017,"You know what they say about first impressions.  Believe it or not, this week was my first time ever going to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant despite having heard great things about both the food and desserts for quite some time.  The place was very busy, so its understandable that it may take a while, but I felt that the wait between apps, main course, dessert and even the check was quite long.  At one point we were wondering if they forgot about our table. The food to me, in general was ok.  The apps which consisted of calamari, nachos and stuffed mushrooms were all good.  No complaints there.  The entree I got was the spicy chipotle chicken on penne.  It wasn't bad, but it had some sweetness to it that didn't seem to fit.  Others that I ate with that had been there before commented on how the food tasted rushed as it was much better when they had been there previously.  The overall consensus was disappointment. For dessert I got the banana cream cheesecake and tried the Godiva and tuxedo slices as well.  All ranged from good to ok, but not good enough to makeup for the wait or the main course.  The apps and our server were the only saving graces from going with a lower rating though a 2 1/2 would be more accurate. As I told my girlfriend, I wouldn't say I'd never eat there again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back and its not on my list of places I must go back to soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=20

For appetizers we had the mac and cheese bites and the stuffed mushrooms. Both tasted heavenly and mouth watering. For my entree I ordered the Chicken Madeira, which was two sautéed chicken breasts, mushrooms mashed potatoes asparagus and cheese, all my favorite ingredients.

Jenna P.,"Lawrence, MA",70,94,150,2.0,9/19/2016,"I've been to this particular restaurant countless times now with various party sizes and have yet to be thrilled with the quality or speed.  A large group of us came in around 5 for dinner. We were told the wait was 2 hours or to sit at the high top tables - which we did, fine, no problems there. Our waiter was a cool guy and did well serving us. The drinks were well presented and of decent size. I asked for my mojito to not be too sweet. It was too sweet and progressively sweeter with each order as if my server or bartender forgot the detail.. Each mojito was $12.95.. which is a totally incorrect price for a chain restaurant. $10 would have been more appropriate. Their meals in general were, in my opinion, a few dollars more than they were worth in many instances too.  I ordered Baja Chicken Tacos. The tortillas were [for some reason] double layered and mushy to the point of falling apart. The rice you could probably chip a tooth on.  I only ate the inside of the tacos and small side order of beans. Most of the others at our table ordered burgers which were decent. I tried someone's fries when they came out and they were room temperature. One girl did not even eat 1/5 of her burger and our server did not ask if she liked her meal (she did not).

It was a decision by our company executives to use this figure and we do so in all of our restaurants nationwide. Prior to printing a suggested guideline on our checks, we did review different restaurants in the high casual dining segment and found that the practice was mixed. Some were calculating pre-tax and some, post-tax.   I am sorry that this decision has disappointed you, and will share your feedback with our company executives.

Ayushi A.,"Plano, TX",394,81,13,4.0,2/11/2016,"One thing thats awesome about the Cheescake factory is how extensive their menu is. For those that don't like too many choices this may be overwhelming but I personally love it.  So in breakdown by dishes:  Skinnylicious Tuscan Chicken: The dish was gigantic so if you're going hungry and considering this it will not do you wrong. The sauce soaked in the tomatoes and the farro was mouthwatering. I absolutely devoured the tomatoes. However, the chicken itself was not cooked that well and was very hard to break it off. It also didn't really have a taste which was surprising because you would have hoped that the sauce soaked into it. I think there are better things on the menu.  GET THE WHITE CHOCOLATE CARAMEL MACADAMIA NUT CHEESECAKE:So the group I was with for the most part we were all trying to be healthy but this was something we could not resist. The nuts are a perfect compliment to the smoothness that is cheesecake and every bite only left you wanting more. I love white chocolate so perhaps I may be biased but 4/4 of us said we would order it again.  Key Lime Cheesecake: THis didn't hit the home run quite so much. It definitely was strong in the key lime flavor so don't expect anything else. But I personally dont enjoy cheesecakes that are fruity based because I am looking for chocolate.

Over the years I've stayed away from the run of the mill cooperate chain restaurants. Although they do have one hell of a menu, a nightmare for servers and bartenders I'm sure (since I am one I can relate), I've noticed a steady decline in details. One example,  the table we were sat at was not wiped down. Not even an attempt to wipe it down was made. It was sticky to the touch and covered in what looked like some sort of kosher salt. Perhaps from a pretzel app or margarita glass. There was salt all over the table. It wasn't busy when we came in for lunch. The waitress was friendly.

Marc S.,"Worcester, MA",38,7,2,1.0,6/26/2017,"I can't for the life of me fathom why people frequent this restaurant with such ardent fervor. It. Is. Terrible. The worst. All around.  First and foremost, the service is beyond terrible. The servers are plain rude. My wife called to make a reservation. The first server told her they couldn't take reservations until 12:30 and hung up. When she called back, a different server told her they don't even take reservations. They aren't any nicer in the restaurant. They ignore you while you're waiting. Once we were finally seated, they barely came around. We were there two hours. No wonder the line is so long.  Second, their food is nothing to write home about. My eggplant parmigiana was cold and was on par with Olive Garden. My wife's chicken and avocado salad was so bland and unimaginative that it's hardly worth mentioning.  And I can't stress this enough: the cheesecake is not that good. Seriously. If you're from Boston or Providence, go anywhere else and it will be better (and less expensive).  My parents love this place but to me it's overpriced and overrated.

Ramesh A.,"Terre Haute, IN",15,42,221,1.0,6/28/2017,"Ever been to a place and feel like you shouldn't come back again. That's this cheese cake factory location in Providence. Right in the downtown occupying prime real estate. What a waste of my time for choosing the worst customer service ever. This incident happened last night 06/23/2017. It started with me and my friends waiting for 5 mins to 10 minutes to be noticed by a receptionist . There was no one at the reservation table. After asking a guy who was adjusting the menu, he helped us out and got us seated in 10 mins which was a pretty quick service.  There comes our waiter- tries his best to show off with his specials menu and then asks for a drink. Once the drinks are placed he hurries us for the order, at that point my friends and I order appetizers and were in no mood for entree. The guy gives this nasty look which my friend feels offended . I brushed it off saying he  probably didn't mean anything. Once we were in the middle of our appetizers he comes back and asks for anything else. At that point I ask him for dessert recommendations. He points at the menu on the table next to me and says give me the menu. I was taken back and offended by way he asked (rude and demanding) and when I asked him dessert recommendations again, he repeats three times to give him the menu on the table . There was no please or may I have the menu please?. At that point I was furious after handing him the menu and he turns to the picture on the menu and says I wanted to show this. This is all in his condescending, arrogant attitude. I wasn't sure what his problem was, I am not sure if it was because we were brown skin ( this is the first time ever I had encountered this kind of incident ever) . I didn't want to confront him for his behavior , I politely asked him to call his manager. By the way the waiter name is Anthony.  Manager showed up and said he was sorry on behalf of the waiter . I asked for a different waiter/waitress which he did. (the new waitress was courteous and professional and even apologized at the end for his colleagues behavior) .I asked the manager if there is going to be any follow up about what action he will be taking, he didn't have an answer. I insisted I would like to know and I will be posting a review on yelp for response. Manager told me I could post one but he can't answer to it .  I am not sure what policies does cheese cake factory has to deal with this kind of behavior by one of their staff members. The manager did try his part to be professional, but had no information for further response.

Allison Y.,"Markham, Canada",184,869,2397,3.0,7/4/2015,"I have heard many faves about The Cheesecake Factory.  I was looking forward to this first encounter.  I admit that I was let down.  It is rather easy for me to summarize the impression I have of The Cheesecake Factory in Providence. Pro: Nice decoration Professional and friendly wait staff Large portion Reasonable price as per portion and decor Fresh ingredients Delicious cheesecake Con: Cutting corners/steps in cooking The BBQ Pork Sandwich was noted in menu as using pulled pork.  The product contained chunks of pork, none pulled into stripes.  The flavour didn't infused inside the pork chunks.  This shortcoming would not have been noticeable should someone have pulled the pork into stripes.  Having said that, the burger was delicious (thumb up to the sauce) if this was a BBQ Pork Chunk Sandwich.  My suggestion is to either pull the pork as described in the menu description, or change the menu description into ""chunks of pork"".  I never expected fish tacos to be authentic in Rhode Island.  What I expected was something that looked like fish tacos and tasted good.  The fish tacos looked okay and came in double corn tortillas.  The white fish strips were chunky and fresh enough.  Unfortunately, the double corn tortillas were completely cold and half stiff.  This indicated that they were not kept warm and moist, or at least not re-hydrated and warmed up before use.  The best way I can describe how unenjoyable these tacos were is to imagine someone serves a hamburger in cold and half hardened buns.   The accompanied bean and rice were not refried beans and Mexican rice, yet both tasted alright.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=40

David E.,"BUZZARDS BAY, MA",1,93,,4.0,6/30/2017,"Ate here today with my mom and aunt. My mother got crab cakes and stuffed mushrooms. and my aunt ordered flatbread pizza and a side salad. I picked two items. First, I got something new from the ""small plate"" options, Nashville Hot Chicken Nuggets (if you've never had Nashville Hot Chicken, it's fried chicken brushed with a spicy paste that includes smoked paprika and cayenne pepper, then served with dill pickle slices and white bread). For my entree, I picked a filet mignon grilled well done, with mashed potatoes. To drink, we all just had ice water. My mother and aunt only said they really enjoyed their food, not saying too much more about it. I really liked the Nashville Hot Chicken Nuggets (any time I can get boneless chicken is a plus) they were a different take on spicy chicken than buffalo wings, and pickles were a nice touch. Unlike hot chicken served in Nashville, this did not come with any bread, just pickles and a side of ranch for dipping. My filet was cooked just as I wanted it, juicy and flavorful, with no pink in the middle. I know that Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants where the prices are on the expensive side, but I didn't even see how much the bill came to, because my aunt snatched it up right away, and announced she was paying for lunch, and didn't want any arguments. No problem here. Our waitress was friendly and attentive (frequently coming by to see if our water glasses needed refilling, and doing so without us having to ask her). Our food did take quite a while to come out from the kitchen, but we attributed that to the crowded dining room. I'll be back soon. I hope they keep that Nashville Hot Chicken on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=40

I didn't know what to get so I go with something I've gotten many times before....the orange chicken. In the past the chicken has definitely been a slightly better quality and the vegetables were way too salty this time around. Too much soy sauce. My boyfriend got the Catfish. I tried a bite and it literally tasted like pure dirt/mud. We Google immediately what the flavor is supposed to be and come to find that the dirt flavor stems from not being washed/soaked properly. YUCK!!! He asks to take it back and get something else. This time the chicken and biscuits. It was good except when I took a bite, got a little crunchy sensation.  Previously I had asked for a ginger ale which I don't know why took so long. So she finally brings out a small bottle of Canada dry that has already been opened?!?!?!?! Wtf.

Now I have been here before and received pretty poor service but didn't hold it against them because I am in the industry and the food is still Delish. This review however is specifically for our server Anthony S.  He was very fun. He didn't have to read specials off a little notepad but he remembered it and all while not sounding like a robot (I hate that) he was for the most part being himself which is awesome. He was extremely patient with my four year old Delilah who had a lot of questions that Anthony had no problem answering. He made her smile the whole time. When the food came out he was concerned about delilahs plate being hot so he brought out a side plate and even helped her cut it so that it could cool off.  I am in the industry and have been for 11 years Anthony actually taught me something last night and I thought I knew it all. What a great server.

I agreed that line of thinking made sense and it had occurred to me, but I still planned to have some cheesecake since the Cheesecake Factory was just a block away.  The local fair I decided to try was a let down, and only the beer I had was worth it. So I didn't eat and beat my feet back up the hill.  Because I wanted to room for my cheesecake and this place always gives a hefty piece, I opted for 2 appetizers rather than a meal. I decided on the: *Chicken Samosas - Crispy wrappers filled with spiced chicken. Served with cilantro dipping sauce. $5.95 *Crispy Crab Bites - Bite sized little crab cakes served with mustard sauce.  While the samosas were good, I didn't entirely enjoy the pairing with the cilantro sauce, though it wasn't bad. The crab bites and mustard bites were nearly divine and at 6 for an appetizer, that's more than enough.  For the reason I go to the Cheesecake Factory I tried a new cake flavor that I've never had. Which was: *Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake - Banana cream cheesecake topped with Bavarian Cream and fresh sliced bananas (I got my bananas on the side.) This is probably officially my favorite cheesecake flavor now.  I had a wonderful solo experience and can't wait to sample the food and dessert here in Providence, RI again, or one of my local factories here in NJ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=60
Chelsea S.,"Providence, RI",124,2,,2.0,1/4/2017,I had originally come in just for cheesecake and the original person I spoke to was so nice and told up to sit if we wanted to eat even thought they were closing shortly. The waitress I had never told me her name and barely came to check up on us throughout our meal. The drinks were warm and ice melted quickly. The food was not worth the hype and completely overpriced. Cheesecake was am amazing but the over all experience was shit,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=60
Stephanie V.,"Providence, RI",26,20,2,2.0,1/9/2017,"Yesterday was my 32nd birthday, my girls surprised me with munchies and cake at the Cheesecake factory, which use to be my favorite restaurant. When we talk to the front desk to make arrangements for a table it was a 45 minute wait but it was okay we knew it was going to take that long anyway because it's such a popular place. My friends go and tell the front desk this is our best friend's birthday please do something really special. The front desk stand  (female, African American & gentleman) stated of course we're going to embarrass her will do something really special and they complimented on how Young I look. I was so excited. 45 minutes later we are lead to our seat. They let us up the stairs and I thought we were going to the booth dining room area but they made us literally took a loop all the way around the restaurant just to sit right where we were sitting waiting for us to be called. That was slightly annoying.  The gentleman who served us was very quiet made no Small Talk whatsoever. Asked us what we wanted to drink we give him our drink order and our appetizer order and we wanted to look a little bit longer on the menu. He did not come back to take our order until 15-20 minutes later. Then he disappeared for another 15-20 minutes, returning finally with drinks and our appetizer. We tell him our order, which we ordered several slices of their cheesecakes for all of us to sample.  The slices are huge and they tasted amazing but when he came back he just dropped off our cakes and walked off but back back two minutes later with the entire staff to sing happy birthday to another table across from us.  They looked completely stunned because they did not request nor had a birthday in their party. Comes to find out they screwed that up so we just paid the check and left. The food and cakes are amazing, the service seriously stinks...I am gonna sadly find a new location that not only have great food, desserts and extremely better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=60

Of course the wait is going to be long, its attached to a huge mall, near the statehouse, and the train station, and on a very busy main street.   Were you thinking it'd be a 5 minute wait???   Hell, even The 99 has an hour long wait at times.   If waiting is such a problem for you, order-out.  Yes, The Cheesecake Factory menu IS available to-go. Now as far as the menu... Yes it has alot to offer.  I would think thats a bonus.  You certainly cant get bored of your menu choices.  To have that many options, and to have them arrive at your table well prepared deinitely says something about the kitchen staff.   The food is always delicious!!!! I have NEVER had any issue with the waitstaff.  EVER.   They've always been sweet, interested, and attentive. My guess as to why you need to go outside to the restaurant is so they dont have to close when the mall does.  Remember theres also an entrance inside the parking garage. Lastly...the cheesecake.    I almost always have a hard time choosing which one to get.  Whenever I go there with friends we always order different cheesecakes so we can take turns trying each others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=60

Things got so much worse from here. Let's talk food. That second star up there is for my husband's burger. He loved it. I opted for the lettuce wraps. The chicken was not edible- it had not been cleaned properly...don't need to further elaborate.

This guy has no place in the front of the house. Nice etiquette.  This review is being written after I contacted the establishment directly with my concerns and was not acknowledged.

I always order a small meal because it's all about the cheesecake. In this case, I ordered the sausage and ricotta flatbread and the Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake. Both were exceptional. The flatbread had just the right amount of ricotta - enough to taste yummy but not so much to make the flatbread mushy. As an added bonus there was a little spinach. That was a surprise that tasted so good. I was catching a flight a little later, so I ate part of my dessert there and took the rest with me. Both servings were so good. Chris's Outrageous has tons of chocolate, some coconut, and real cheesecake. It's truly wonderful overkill. If you like Cheesecake Factory, you'll like this one.

I don't know about all of you, but my girlfriend and I sure love cheesecake, but honestly that is probably the only thing that is actually really good at this restaurant.  I normally order the burrito grande and allows enjoy it and the food seems to be just above average for the rest of the menu from what I here from friends and those whom we eat out with.  Honestly I believe some of the meals are overpriced and the service as been diminishing since this place became so well known.  My girlfriend and I went here this past Friday with two friends of ours and left not as satisfied as we expected.  I ordered the burrito, like I said, and she ordered the eggplant parm.  My meal was very good and filling and was at a cost of around $15.  Her meal was similar in price; however, the eggplant was very dry, the pasta was plain, and there wasn't much sauce that came on it at all.  Overall she was not satisfied with the meal she had gotten.  My friends ordered two pasta dishes and seemed to enjoy them enough; however, weren't ecstatic about their meals either.  We started off the meal with the traditional bread which is allows some that that is great to hold you over before a meal.  We also ordered the nachos and my two friends bought two beers to start as well.  The nachos were pretty good; however, it took an extremely long time to get them and that something that simply shouldn't occur with an appetizer.  My friends beers were at a cost of $9 which is a little pricey especially for the common beers that they chose. The beers took over 15 minutes to get to the table and that is another thing we were disappointed in.  The server seemed like a robot not really caring about what we wanted, but more so focusing on giving some what of an automated and typical  introduction of the menu.  She was polite; however, very slow.  We all ordered cheesecakes to go and three of us had meals to take home.  The server took each plate and wrapped them for us, but when she gave them back to us she handed them to us individually and when we all got home we realized she had given two of us the wrong meals.  We had already parted ways at this point so we weren't able to switch them back.  The cheesecake was very good as it always is.  I had the red velvet cheesecake and Tori had the Oreo cheesecake and they were both very good.  Honestly this place has changed since it began and not in a good way.  Overall the food was subpar for what you pay for, but the cheesecake was still good.  I'm not sure if I will come back again due to the bad service and average food, but I may be back just for the cheesecake because that is the one category they never disappoint me with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=80

I've gotten the salad previously at another Cheesecake Factory location and really enjoyed it, but this time not so much. The beets tasted like they had been fermented in a salt brine. The last time I ordered this, they did not taste that way. The salty flavor did not complement this sweet salad at all, and it was just plain funky.

I will forever keep returning The Cheesecake Factory.  Sure, it's a little pricey for a chain, but the portions are incredibly huge. If you're super hungry, it's worth it, or you can take home leftovers. Win-win. I have a love affair with the Chicken Bellagio. I remember when it was a new special on the menu years ago and I'm so happy they made it a permanent menu item. I have a really hard time ordering something other than that when I'm there, but I'm getting better at venturing out. It's easy with such an insanely big menu. The nachos are amazing but more filling then you could ever imagine (even without chicken on them). My boyfriend and I made that mistake... ordered nachos for an appetizer and got entrees. Never again. Now if we're in the mood for nachos, we get another small appetizer to split. Usually the chicken sliders. They're amazing. My boyfriend was only disappointed in his meal once -- a Hawaiian pizza that was seriously undercooked and looked like it was frozen. He didn't eat it, we were comped, and it was okay. Now, he stays far away from the pizza. Luckily, there are a million other options for him to try. We always get cheesecake to go, because I would actually be worried about my well-being if I tried to eat a slice of cheesecake after such huge portions.  Overall, I really do love it here.

Jeannette G.,"Bronx, NY",3,17,,1.0,12/5/2016,"Today my boyfriend and I attempted to have lunch at the Cheese cake factory, what an epic fail! Our waiter Carlos was pleasant and professional. The kitchen staff and management is probably to blame for our disatisfaction. We arrived at 1:20, placed our order as soon as we were seated, we literally waited an hour for our food which never arrived. We only ordered two sandwiches, I do not think it requires that much time to prepare especially when the restaurant was not very busy. Our waiter did come and apologize for the wait and stated our food was being plated, 20 minutes later Carlos returns again to apologize as well as to offer us free dessert, very tiny consulation for waiting an hour for food that never arrived. I am not sure what the issue was with our order, but it just didn't make sense. Needless to say,  we got up and left. I think the manager should have came to our table and talked to us instead of our waiter. A free dessert was not going to change the fact that our food was taking way too long. Even if it did arrive an hour later at that point I would not have felt eating the food anymore. Sadly, I will never return to this particular location again.

Leela S.,"Seattle, WA",47,858,126,3.0,6/10/2014,"If you're ever up for a gastronomical challenge, come finish a single slice of cheesecake by yourself without exploding from either being too full or too overloaded with sugar. No, they're not terrible; they're just giant, giant slices which are extremely sweet. Sizes follow the same gargantuan theme when it comes to entrees. However, I find the entrees overpriced simply because they aren't tasty enough to justify ~$15 a plate! You will probably get a meal and a half out of the serving, though, so I guess there's that. This is a good place to come with a big group because they have oodles of seating available. Their menu is also varied enough to cater to a wide range of palettes; everyone in your party is likely to find something they want (vegetarians included).

The bread - amazing, as  always. Our waiter was nice and attentive, which is usually my experience here. I ordered one of my faves, the chicken bellagio. Two large chicken cutlets over pesto pasta and a small arugula salad. Everything was prepared perfectly and tasted great. We skipped dessert (I know, a sin) as we were all very full and hoping to not have to be rolled to our cars.  The menu is extensive and the cocktails are always very good.

Meg N.,"Millville, MA",15,72,6,1.0,2/28/2016,"Just get the damn cheesecake to go. My family had a gift card that we received at Christmas for this fine establishment.  We arrived at the restaurant around 730pm on a Saturday and were told that the wait would be approximately an hour for the four of us. We were find with the wait (its Saturday night, there is going to be a wait wherever we go) and were handed a pager.  Around 845, we still had not been paged/called. I went up to the host and asked how much longer our wait would be, seeing as how they told us an hour at 730. He said that we were next on the list and it shouldnt be any longer than 10 minutes for a table. At 9, I went up again to the host. Said it had been 15 minutes, and asked if we had been forgotten as people who were waiting that arrived after us were being seated. He said we werent on the list, and insisted that he had paged us 10 minutes ago. I had the pager in my hands. It had never gone off.... He said ""Im paging it right now."" as I held that pager that was not going off right in front of him. So, CLEARLY your pagers are not working properly and your ignorant host(s) have no clue what they are doing... Fast forward to when we order, my husband and I ordered salmon and pasta, both of which came out together... My SIL and BIL food was no where to be found. TEN minutes later, the waitress walks by and notices that they dont have their burgers. She comes back with the burgers and tells us the places are EXTREMELY hot... which in the restaurant world means ""Sorry, your shit has been sitting under the heat lamps for a long ass time so if it tastes awful, my bad."". My BIL and SIL didnt touch their burgers, they were completely inedible. They looked disgusting. The waitress took both burgers off the bill... By this time it was close to 11pm...

Megan L.,"Milwaukee, WI",46,251,816,2.0,1/4/2014,"Well, the CCF is your run of the mill restaurant and extremely overpriced. And I mean EXTREME! Like...unnecessary.  None of the apps are cheaper than $8 that I saw. Most were around the $9-12. And we're just talking apps people!!! This isn't some fancy, 4 or 5 star restaurant. This is the CCF...a chain restaurant. Okay. I got the chicken quesadilla app. It's HALF a quesadilla, 4 slices. This is a perfect portion for an app to share with someone before a meal....for $6 not for the $12 it actually cost. And because everything is so overpriced, I decided to only have an app as my meal. However the price, it was a decent quesadilla. Not the best, but I enjoyed it.  The cheesecakes that I took home were $15. This I don't mind because I'm not about to make a banana cream cheese cake for fun at home. It was by far the best cheesecake I have ever had! Ugh I really loved it. I've also had the Oreo, which is good, but was just too rich for that whole piece.  So I gave the CCF 2 stars because there were only two good things about our visit. 1) banana cheesecake 2) our waiter was super friendly and honest about the food when I asked.  Atmosphere is fine. It's huge! And loud, but so am I, so that balances itself out. No long wait on a Saturday for lunch. Too many options on the menu. Overpriced.

Jef S.,"Providence, RI",97,552,,4.0,12/30/2013,"A-ok. I brought in my two little guys for lunch today, and we had a nice time. I'm not one for chain restaurants, and normally I wouldn't be caught dead spending my money here. But we had a gift certificate and gave it a shot. I've been in CCFs all across the country and their m.o. is always the same: we'll make you wait at least an hour for a table, feed you a ton of food and overcharge you for it, and you're gonna like it, beeyatches. And this CCF is ALWAYS mobbed. Ahem. In spite of this philosophy, today was pretty good. We went right at open and there was no wait. Our server Heather was friendly (if not overly chummy), very helpful, and delivered everything with the quickness. The kid food was kid food, but well presented. The rugrats thus satiated, I settled on a Firefly margarita (egads, sweet! But still a good margarita), Ahi Tartare (bomb, but not a large enough portion to my liking...wonder if they have it dinner sized?), and Asian Chicken Lettuce wrap tacos....really very tasty with great topping sauces. And the brown bread. Gotta love the brown bread.  The price tag was surprisingly cheap, as no single plate was more than $7... The margarita was the most expensive item.  Yeah, you have to park at the godawful PP mall to get in here. But all things considered, if the circumstances were as perfect as they were today, I'd go back happily.

AJ T.,"Cumberland, RI",43,92,13,2.0,12/30/2015,"Go for the cheesecake. My girlfriend received a gift card for the Cheesecake factory so we decided to have to appetizers and drinks before going to the movies at the Providence Place Mall.  The restaurant already had a line forming at 4:30 so we sat at a high top at the bar.  Our server seemed completely disinterested in us, and I was disappointed there were only 3 draft beers available, sam adams, sam adams winter, and blue moon.  So I ordered a tall blue moon and my gf got a strawberry basil margarita.  Little did I realize, upon checking some of the reviews on here, that there was a happy hour from 4-6pm, as our server never informed us, nor gave the special happy hour menu.  Whether or not this was to get us to buy items not off that menu (which are 15-30% cheaper) I don't know, but when I asked her for a happy happy hour menu she seemed confused.  Long story short, we ordered (from the happy hour specials), the beet and goat cheese salad, buffalo chicken pot-stickers, tuna tartare, and pretzel crusted chicken. My beer was flat, my girlfriend's drink sugary and lacking almost any alcohol, for 10 bucks a pop on those drinks you expect something half decent. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out to us, which I understand it's busy but these were all appetizers that didn't require much attention.  All I took away from this was a mild stomach ache. If you like the Cheesecake Factory, by all means go nuts, but for now I'll just stick to the cheesecake there (which ironically I didn't even want after going this past time).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=140

Victoria G.,"East Providence, RI",30,196,209,4.0,1/27/2015,"Coming back the food was Amazing. So good I couldn't put my fork down , but very filling. The bread they gave in the beginning was fresh and toasted perfectly on the outside. I ordered the pizza which is cut into 10 slices and reasonably priced and filling. The dough was soft with a bit of crunch to it and just really good. Finally trying the cheesecake was just out of this world! I ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake which includes a bottom chocolate crust layer with regular cheesecake and humongous globs of cookie dough with walnuts drizzled on top and in the cookie dough. I can't forget the whipped cream they put on the plate and on top of the cheesecake. Lastly the chocolate chips they sprinkled on each whipped cream circle. Why you may ask this is only four stars? If the food wasn't good then this would have been another one star for me. We waited 2 hours and 32 minutes to be seated. No reservations could be made on Sunday, so we took our chances and went in at 4:15 for a 5:00 dinner. They said an hour and a Half wait so we put our name down for the next available table and we went to the mall next door and looked around. Nearing the hour and a half mark we went back to the restaurant and was told another 20 minutes. Ok another 20 minutes we can live without it. There is one small booth to wait which was filled to The max with people. So we waited and waited, our feet getting tired of standing , our stomachs grumbling and then our buzzer vibrates. We arrived at that restaurant at 4:15 and was seated at almost 7:30 with the exaggeration of only 20 minutes left. This restaurant lacks severely on their waiting times , waiting area and just front organization. It was a mad house of people, squishing In everywhere waiting. In the way of other people eating , in the way of waiters and waitresses, just complete chaos. Our server was very nice though , and checked in about every 20 seconds asking for refills. So that was good. We had two servers in the beginning but one of them went on break and forgot to tell the other one of my friend's order and she got her meal while we were eating dessert. At least our other good server continued to be wonderful and asked if she wanted any bread or food to tie her over until then. One server was amazing(wish I caught her name ) , the other terrible.

It was huge, dressed perfectly, and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. I love salad but I don't usually order it in chain restaurants because they are too often overdressed or limp.

You basically have to fight for tables here unless you want to wait a longgggg time. So how about when they call your name and you think you have a table...you don't. You wait at the top of the stairs for them to call your name. Not a great system if you ask me....Then the wait service was slow and the food took forever to come out. The food was just average and I found it to be a bit overly salted. I think the cheesecake was the best part of the meal. The place was so noisy and crowded and clearly could not handle the large crowds of people.

Rena W.,"Woonsocket, RI",5,69,159,2.0,6/16/2016,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. I went in last Friday with a co-worker who took me out for lunch for my birthday.  We arrived at noon and seated promptly. When we were seated it took a bit for our server to arrive but I didnt think anything of it.  Then we ordered water and waited and waited.....I said to my friend ""why is it taking so long for water"" when it finally arrived. Since we have an hour for lunch we gave the waitress our orders at that time.  We each had a salad.  Then we waited and waited again....no salads....no waitress...nada until 12:40....as I was watching my clock. When she brought the salads. I said ""that was a very long wait for salads"".  I was shocked with her reply....""I will get you the manager"". There was no...""I'm sorry for the delay"" or anything like that.  Plus, I didnt even ask for the manager.  During the next 10 min, no manager came by, no waitress either to see if we needed anything, to ask if everything was ok, etc.  She came back and said ""did the manager come by?""  and I told her no.  The manager finally came by and I explained what happened.

We arrived at The Cheesecake Factory at 5:30 pm. There was an hour wait. We waited. We were seated at about 6:35. We ordered our appetizers and entrees at the same time. We asked to have them put in at the same time so we would make it to our play on time. Our food didn't come out until about 7:20. It was only 2 out of 3 of the appetizers we had ordered and no entrees at all. The waiter apologized as one of our apps hadn't been rung in at all. The entrees hadn't been sent yet. So he said he would put a rush on it. It is now 7:45 and STILL no entrees. We ask to speak to the manager. We tell him we cannot eat our entrees now and we need to leave. So, he apologizes and packs them TO GO. He tells us if we want we can come back after the show for free cheesecake to make up for it. Our bill was about $150, we were late for our show after wasting 2 1/2 hours of our time, and majority of the food collected condensation in take out containers in my car. It is soggy and nasty. To add insult to injury, we went back for our cheesecake at around 11:00 pm when the restaurant was empty and STILL waited 20 mins for a manager to come out and get it for us.

Marcy L.,"Douglas, MA",458,550,533,1.0,4/26/2013,"Lunch : that moment to yourself during the hectic workday.   Friday Lunch : ...freeeedooomm!  My department was ordering lunch today and, rather than be the ""party-pooping vegetarian locavore"", I set my preferences aside and went with the popular vote: Cheesecake Factory.  [shrug] -ok!  Each location has its own take-out menu, so I perused the 20pages of massive meaty meals to find (aaaaalllllllllllll the way at the end) the light/""SkinnyLicious"" menu of low(-ish) calorie items.  With pear and blue cheese in sight, I made my selection: Pear & Endive salad (claiming to be under 590 calories....good....it's a SALAD!) : Grilled Chicken, Endive, Radicchio, Arugula, Butter Lettuce, Roasted Pear, Blue Cheese, Candied Pecans and Tomato Served with Our SkinnyLicious® Vinaigrette"" $13.95.  Sounds pretty good, right?  I placed my order (sans poulet). Friday antics resumed until our coworker returned with the order.  The ""call-out, carton pass"" ritual ensued until we were left with one box, and my empty hands.  ""What the heck is THIS?"" my coworker joked and he poked at the last massive take-out box.  I peered inside at the scant layer of wilted greens and three tiny blue cheese crumbles.  ""Must be mine....""  I reported in a disappointing tone. The serving was LESS than my coworker's SIDE SALAD (yet placed in a MASSIVE box, perhaps to add extra insult for declining the poultry), and there was no pear at all (sooo it was a soft-lettuce and blue cheese CRUMB salad?....for FOURTEEN DOLLARS?!).  What I *DID* consume was relatively tasty; your typical ""sugared American salad"" to appeal to those who don't like vegetables.   I was 100% disappointed in the time it took to process the order, the flavor, and the most PA-THET-IC excuse for a FOURTEEN DOLLAR salad that I've seen in a long time. Lesson learned.  As the Genie in Aladdin said: ""Remember, bbbeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee yourself.""  I wasn't true to myself when I ordered this flop.  Cheesecake Factory: you might be able to fool others with your loud ambiance, your ""fresco"" décor, and your bajillion-calorie desserts......but in the city of truth, there are so SO many better options than your sugar-coated menu",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=100

Going there as a part of Tom's Birthday dinner, was a treat. Always a beautiful restaurant, well kept, and great waitstaff.   While we have been here many times, the large selection on their menu always causes a long debate. However, this time I couldn't branch out I had to re-try the Orange Chicken. I had ordered this previously at a different location. it came out beautifully garnished and with a strong orange scent. Who would think, Chinese food at the cheesecake factory could be so delicious. The flavor was one of the boldest flavors I have experienced when ordering Orange Chicken. My only disappointment was the lack of sauce, I live for the extra sauce on the place and due to the beautiful garnishments and presentation there was no extra sauce to be had! This was such a light, refreshing chicken dish prepared with a light and crunchy coating.    Louisiana Chicken Pasta, this was an AMAZING dish. This was a  Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce. The New Orleans sauce was to die for!! Such a bold cream sauce, packed with flavor really made the dish. The chicken was perfectly coated and baked, but the best part was the sauce... I truly cannot rave enough about this sauce!

The sauce was blah!  Prior to the meal, we were brougt warm bread ( always a good move for a restaurant) but the white bread was too hard to eat.  Ordered their namesake = cheesecake..

Tea L.,"North Providence, RI",0,8,,2.0,3/9/2017,"Definitely had one of the most bad dining experiences here. First, let's talk about how they do not take reservations on weekends ( their busiest times) I personally do not understand this logic. Because as soon as you walk into this restaurant it's like trying to enter a club..it's literally shoulder to shoulder ridiculous. The wait was 45 mins (ended up waiting over an hour). That's fine, it's expected on Saturday night. But ..but.. how do you not take reservations, knowing how busy this restaurant gets and have a waiting area big enough to seat two ppl! So it literally is comparable to chaos in there. For such a huge restaurant they definitely could do better with the seating issue. Now when me and my friends finally were seated. We waited about 10 mins just for our waiter to get to us (with no water) then waited an additional 15 mins for our drinks. Still, with NO water. The waiter did not bring us anything the whole time we were sitting at the table like idiots with bread with nothing to drink!! Our waiter was ALL over the place could not focused and we could barely get his full attention for more than 60 seconds. The only reason I'm rating this place 2 stars is because the food no doubt was DELICIOUS. I mean after waiting 35 mins for it it's better be right? Anyways, after finishing our food and asking for our check. We waited 15 mins before our waiter shouting about how his house was on fire and had to leave immediately. So he left and we sat at table again like idiots waiting for our check with no one waiting on us... finally we caught the attention of another frazzled waitress and got the hell out of there.

The good thing too is if you want to eat healthy, you can (I know sans cheesecake) but if you want to treat yourself, CF is there for you too. An underrated cocktail selection is always on the rotation for the season. Service is always top notch. The only issue that many complain about, no reservations. Key for you then is to go to CF on a weeknight right around 5-6.

Connie W.,"Cupertino, CA",231,48,758,3.0,6/4/2014,"I have a friend who loves cheesecake as much as I do - she and I have tried all of the cheesecakes here. The winner of our ""Cheesecake Bracket"" was the Red Velvet, but I like to save it for special occasions. If I were to get a cheesecake on a regular day, I would go for the lemon raspberry (the tangy lemon mousse and ladyfingers keep it light, and the raspberry sauce is actually surprisingly genuine), tiramisu (fun and creative interpretation of an Italian classic), or the cherry cheesecake (the classic with sour cream topping and a cascade of sweet and tart cherries - only for cherry lovers!). Oreo Dream Extreme is also amazing, if you like oreos (profound, eh?).  Why the 3 stars? While service is usually good, once in a while there's a waiter with an attitude. Also, the savory food is really not that special. The only savory food I would order again is the blue cheese, pear, and walnut flatbread - a cliche yet scrumptious combination of sweet, salty, nutty flavors. The perfect appetizer to a dinner of cheesecakes (you need something savory to keep yourself sane). As long as you make cheesecake the main event, you'll have an enjoyable time. P.S. You know that brown oatmeal bread they give you? That stuff is good with whipped cream/cheesecake smeared on top.

I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants and this place is wicked overpriced, but as much as I want to hate them, I just can't! Every time I come I have to get the fried mac & cheese. It is like heaven. They make balls of mac & cheese and then bread, deep fry them, and serve over a pink/red sauce. They are so cheesy, crispy and addicting! Recently my boyfriend ordered the pear & blue cheese flatbread, and it was one of the best things we have ever eaten. The combination of flavors was wonderful and all of the toppings were very fresh. The blue cheese crumbles were HUGE and had a bit of a nice smokey flavor. Our only complaint about it is that the serving was much too small. We also loved the zucchini, portobella and avocado fries. They were nice and crisp and not greasy or soggy at all. On the side it came with two dipping sauces that were very good. Once I'm done eating here, I never have any room for cheesecake.... and that's sad because it's really the best part. Luckily they can always box up some slices for you to take home.

When the waitress came back with our drinks she explained what was going on and how the alarm system is connected to the mall. She then took our order. My friend was very specific in saying no onion and that he had an allergy. She acknowledge it and told him she make sure no onion. When we got our food, he had onion in his dish. They took the dish back. The waitress told him that she noted it when she sent the order in and apologized for the mix up in the kitchen. The manager came by after and apologized.

Keyana G.,"Woonsocket, RI",0,27,12,1.0,7/17/2015,"Ruined my 21st birthday! I had a reservation for 15 people made three weeks in advance. It was a party of family members travelling as far as New Hamshire for my birthday. It was 11:45 am when I arrived for my 12:00 reservation, traffic was horrible due to April construction and there was practically no parking. The restaurant was empty. I went and told the host that I arrived for my reservation, she said, ""Actually they already checked in but we can't seat you until everyone is here."" I turn around and see six of my party over in the waiting area. So half of my party is already here (since my boyfriend and I arriving makes eight people) and they won't even seat us? I sat down with them and my seven year old brother and one year old sister are getting restless since there is nothing for them to do and we wait for the rest of the party to get here. My grandparents call me and say they are parked but can't find the restaurant because it's a hike from the garage, and while I'm on the phone with them the hostess comes back over and says that she can only hold the table until 12:05. So I turn to her and say, ""You are going to turn away a reservation for a party of 15 for not being here within five minutes of the reservation? In what universe does 15 people arrive at a place within five minutes of each other?"". She explains it's ""house policy."" In every restaurant we've been to, reservations are held for a courtesy of 15 minutes. My boyfriend gets off the phone with the remainder of our party, which traveled in together, and said they were walking over as we speak, and the hosts are already dismantling the table (it's 12:01!). At 12:07 everyone is here and our table was dismantled, the restaurant was STILL empty, and 15 angry people walked out of the restaurant and down the street to another more conveinent location for Saturday lunch.

Amy G.,"Acushnet, MA",7,37,22,5.0,1/18/2015,Visited this location after a show at a local theater - and we were looking to have a quick bite so we could get back home to relieve the babysitter.  Unfortunately we had a 30min wait - but seeing the bakery area where they display all those Devine cheesecakes - we held on. First and foremost our waiter was fantastic - we let him know we were running short on time - and he worked his magic with getting bread and drinks on our table in a flash. I know that this sounds too good to be true - but we got our meals within 10 min of order - I was shocked!  I ordered the Asian lettuce wraps and I was more than pleased (ordered a light dinner as I knew that trying some of their legendary cheesecake was in my definite future). The chicken was grilled perfectly and coated in a delicious  sauce. The Bibb lettuce was crisp and held the ingredients well. The two sauces they offered were a great compliment to the dish. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and he actually commented that they cooked it the way he ordered it - amazing as he hasn't had that happen in a long time. Due to the rapid disappearance of his burger I noted he was enjoying it - one thing that really impressed me was the thick cut bacon they used (not that thin crappy kind you get at other places). The waiter was so attentive to our need to scoot outta there - he gave us our bill without prompting and delivered two ice teas in take out cups for our ride home. I could have hugged this guy he was so good. Now we had pre-planned that dessert was going to happen but we needed it packed - so when we got home (and our stomachs had settled) we got to enjoy the real star of the night. Godiva chocolate cheesecake and Tiramisu cheesecake - it was so rich you just can't finish the slice. They prepare the take home slices with the sauces and whip cream so they do not spare the details - which makes this dessert a must try!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=180

Anita D.,"Cranston, RI",200,147,212,4.0,11/20/2010,"This place ranks as the King of all chain restaurants.  If anyone dares to argue that, I have 14 pages of scrumdiddlyumptious menu items to prove otherwise.  The difficulty of going to CCF is that I'm torn between getting something I know and love or trying something new and exciting. I left out a star because you really need to go during off-peak hours or else you are waiting a long time in a small space. Bar area seating is first come/first serve, but its like a hunting scene out of Discovery Channel...groups of people eyeing that ONE dirty table, and the people at that particular table seem like they will never leave.  Once they finally do, its a matter of who gets there first... Also, ask for a booth, even if its an extra wait, it is worth the personal space. Nothing like New York bistro style dining...WHEN YOU'RE IN NEW YORK.   Here are a list of items that I've had: *small plates & snacks/appetizers* -edamame- perfectly salted, always plump -ahi tartare- yummy, just a bit on the salty side -mini corn dogs- mmmm good -thai lettuce wraps- dont be fooled, in all its deliciousness, NOT low cal or low fat. -buffalo blasts- think crab rangoon, but filled w/cheesy buffalo chicken. -spicy ahi tempura roll- pretty good, t the 1st choice -avocado eggrolls- makes the Chilis southwestern eggrolls look like cheap freezer food....oh wait, THEY ARE *pizzas* -they're all good, get one w/a side salad. *burgers* -factory burger- my favorite one! My man likes the classic burger.  *specialties* -fish tacos- very tasty, beware of fried tortillas, so good they're bad -bang bang chicken & shrimp- think Thai food, spicy coconut based curry, veggies & rice. Love it, one of my favorites! *pastas* -louisiana chicken pasta- spicy, cajun & good. Fried chicken too greasy for my liking -evelyns favorite pasta- fantastic vegetarian medley, tossed in light olive oil -garlic noodles- one of my favorites, should be served w/a pack of gum *seafood* -miso salmon- my ALL TIME favorite dish. Its the perfect glazed salmon w/a creamy miso sauce, pea pods & rice.  *salads* -caeser- best one I've had, I like the bite from the imense amount of garlic in the dressing. Also need a pack of gum -chicken tostada salad- fabulous, if you like mexican  -weight management asian chicken salad- suprisingly delicious! I would definitely get this again *a list of my favorite cheesecakes* -reese's peanute butter chocolate  -lemon raspberry -pineapple upside down                  -dutch apple caramel -chocolate chip cookie dough         -pumpkin -snickers bar                                   -oreo The Lemoncello cream torte is light and fluffy if you want to stay away from the heavy cheesecakes. I had breakfast there a couple of times and the omelettes were very good.  My favorite was the eggs benedict florentine w/spincah, bacon & grilled tomato. Drinks, well all I can say is the Ultimate Margarita is worth the price and gets you where you need to be. Strong, not like the crappy juice ones that you get anywhere else! Beware, margaritas tend to be high in calories (500+) All in all, if you want to save money, go around lunch time. You ALWAYS get a heaping of food, but they have lunch portions available, I cant tell the difference either way.  You are more than likely going to take home the rest of your meal, unless you have a tapeworm problem or are training for the olympics. If you are not a leftover type of person, share your meal with someone. Either way, good food for a good price.  The 14 page menu can be confusing, but get a drink, nibble on their yummy bread and take your time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=180

The cheese is cooked just enough, and the mushrooms are bountiful. With a drizzle of truffle oil, these mini pizzas are wonderful appetizers not to be shared.

Ami G.,"Providence, RI",25,99,,4.0,8/10/2012,"Six weeks ago, I declared to my husband that when I finished my semi-torturous session of summer classes, we would go out to dinner (on a weekday night) to the one place we never go to since it is way too busy on weekends but that we both mutually love and adore- the Cheesecake Factory! See, here in Providence, there is only one Cheesecake Factory, and it is epically busy on weekends, to the point you usually have to wait an hour or two if you go around a normal dinner time. We typically get there at least twice a year, but this year, we haven't gone once yet! In fact, since I became vegan in December, the Cheesecake Factory has been off of our radar!   Well that all changed on Wednesday night.  We didn't get there until about 8:30, and there was still a fifteen minute wait.  I wasn't sure how much I would still be enamored by the Cheesecake Factory now that I avoid dairy and gluten, but after my experience there, it is safe to say the Cheesecake Factory remains at the top of my chain restaurant list!   They brought out their famed pumpernickel and sourdough bread and butter, both of which I passed on but did have a love affair with in my gluten-eating days!  We started with their made-to-order guacamole, and I asked that they leave out the sour cream in favor of double salsa.   The guac is outstanding! We ordered it spicy, and while it wasn't really, it did have a nice kick that reared itself periodically. It was uber-flavorful though- way better than any store-bought guac I have tried, and honestly, it was better than the guac I get at my favorite Providence Mexican restaurant!   Of course, no guac is complete without an endless supply of salty, crunchy tortilla chips!   For dinner, I ordered their ""Skinnylicious"" fresh vegetable salad. Now a word on this ""Skinnylicious"" business- I think the only difference between this and their regular fresh vegetable salad is the pomegranate dressing is low-fat in the Skinnylicious version. Honestly, I could have cared less if I got the Skinnylicious version or the regular one, but since the lower-fat option was available, I went with it.    I did make some changes to the original salad- I asked that they leave off the cheese and grilled chicken, and instead add some pecans and dried cranberries. Out waitress warned us there was an extra charge for that, which I thought was silly because I was essentially just making swaps, but whatever- I did it anyway!   The salad was. . . astoundingly gigantic, to say the least! It was an awesome mix of greens, edamame (yay for vegan protein in a chain restaurant salad!), apple, cucumber, tomato, green beans, beets, pecans and cranberries. Everything was chopped into perfect bite-sized bits, and the pom dressing covered every single component perfectly. I have to say, this salad was epic (been using that word a lot in this post!) and incredible and I am sad I was only able to eat about a sixth of it!   The reason I couldn't devote my full appetite to the salad was because my husband and I made an ordering oopsie. He got a burger, and asked that the fries be on a separate plate so I could have some. However, I had my eyes set on sweet potato fries, so of course, I ordered them too!  You figured out what our oopsie was right? Talk about over-ordering! My order of sweet potato fries was about double the size of the ones he got, which in and of themselves were quite plentiful in the fry department! In other words, we had fries up the ying-yang, and since they don't come home as leftovers as well as my salad would, I had to prioritize and keep my focus on fry consumption. Ok, when you have fries this crispy-on-the-outside and gooey on the inside, perhaps my dilemma wasn't entirely so bad! I ate a load of fries, and they were so tasty, but truth be told, there still was a load or two left!   I am upset with myself that my stomach shut down so quickly.  On a good day, I could have eaten so much more of those delectable sweet fries drowned in ketchup. Back in the dairy-eating days, I would always follow up my meal with a huge slice of either the peanut butter cup or Oreo cheesecake. I am actually glad (for my stomach) that I didn't even have that option last night, as I don't think following up that enormous meal with cheesecake is what I needed at all!   The Cheesecake Factory, in my opinion, is like the Bentley of chain restaurants. The food is always so consistently delicious- in all my times going there since it opened in Providence years ago, I have never had an experience with their food that was less than stellar.with their food that was less than stellar.

We were told we could not call early either...that at least one of us would have to show up a couple of hours early and that ""could cut our wait time in half"".  When I told the manager that we didn't want to make a large group of kids stand outside like that he said "" large groups of elderly people, even with walkers and canes have to do it all the time"".  What an ass.  I understand not wanting to take reservations, but with a large group who will be on the list for hours...when you have nowhere for people to wait but outside on a street corner sidewalk in the middle of the winter, seems heartless and greedy.  We'll go to the Melting Pot instead.   It's a little more expensive there, but a least they treat their customers with respect",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=200
Eva B.,"New York, NY",10,38,,4.0,6/26/2012,"I've been to the cheesecake factory on multiple occasions over the years. I enjoy their huge selection and being a vegetarian, it's nice to go to a chain restaurant that has more than two vegetarian options on the menu. Their cheesecake is delicious, the only cheesecake that I will eat. They also have delicious pasta dishes like Garlic noodles and Evelyn's pasta which I usually get. Their raspberry lemonade is divine and their crispy artichoke hearts are the perfect appetizer. Just recently I went to the cheesecake factory with my boyfriend and I decided to try some new items off the menu. I got the farro salad which was absolutely delicious and unique with chewy farro, sweet beets, goat cheese feta, tomatoes, and crunchy english cucumbers. The salad was refreshing and as a small plate, just the right portion. In addition I also got the Sweet corn tamale cakes, which were also very unique. These mexican style corn cakes had a very yummy salsa verde, fresh pico, and creamy avocado pieces on top. However without the sauce the cakes tasted a tad bit too sweet and would have tasted better if they were cooked crispier and weren't so soggy. My boyfriend enjoyed his food for the most part, I believe he got the steak diane. On the downside however, our waitress was terrible. She put items down and ran away and was the slightest bit personable. I had to talk to two other male servers to get the lowdown on the tamales, assuring me that they were good. When I asked her she gave me a blank stare and seemed unsure in her answer to my question. she cleared our plates promptly, but didn't posses the best people skills. You usually cannot go wrong with the cheesecake factory, the only huge problem usually is the long wait. I get impatient when I'm hungry and this is probably one of the only negatives about cheesecake besides the occasion rude waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=200
Andria T.,"Providence, RI",72,198,17,1.0,3/10/2012,"In a city with as many amazing restaurants as Providence, there is absolutely no reason to go to a place as horrific as the cheesecake factory.  But people do, and I just don't get it.   I've been there about three times and it is always jam-packed with people.  It's like the mall at christmas time every day in that restaurant.  Here's just a short list of why the Cheesecake factory is crap. Overpriced. The food is mediocre. The decor is atrocious. It is incredibly loud.  And my biggest complaint--the unforgiveable-- THERE ARE ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE MENU (sorry to shout)  As if it's not annoying enough to pay those kind of prices for lame food, they are actually trying to sell you things right there as you decide on what to eat.  I found that so appalling that I actually wrote an email to the company.  They replied with:  ""Thank you for e-mailing us regarding your dining experience at our Providence Cheesecake Factory restaurant. I apologize that you were offended by the advertisements in our menu. For the past 20 years we have included advertisements to promote area businesses and to compliment our ""book-style"" menu. It was not our intention to offend you. I will certainly share your comments with our company executives."" The ads are not for area businesses, they are for handbags, cruises and the like.  And how does adding ads make something ""book-style""?  Books don't have ads, you morons, magazines do.

She definitely likes her job and it shows. Our server (Nicole?) was awesome, gave us time to look at the menu, made suggestions/answered questions for my SO (his first time there!??!) and made sure we were always being checked on, had water filled, plates cleared, etc. I always get the Thai Lettuce Wraps for dinner, he had Buffalo Chicken Blasts, Caesar Salad, and the Filet Mignon. Everything was so good, came out at the correct staggered times, cooked properly, etc. Instead of cheesecake we both had a Georgia Peach cocktail, consisting of vodka, and frozen raspberry + peach puree swirled all around in a snifter with a huge piece of mint. It literally tastes (and looks!!) like a yummy, frozen peach.. so good on a Summer's night. We took the advice of out server and host and checked out WaterFire. I guess it was the first lighting of the season and I'm glad they mentioned it to us. Made for a great end to our date. If I had anything to suggest..

Well, this CF was the best one I've been to. I'll start with the service -- the host was very gracious, and we had a phenomenal server who offered my mom a great recommendation (she got the navajo and LOVED it). My water was always full, and everything came in a timely manner. Now the food. I was torn between using the skinnylicious menu (yes, that is right, they have an entire menu of ""healthy"" options -- everything under 590 calories for an entree -- and all delicious) or the regular menu. I opted for the skinny version of the veggie burger (which is the same veggie burger on the regular menu, sans cheese). It was not your traditional gross microwaveable patty. It had farro, brown rice, beets, and some other ingredients -- and was absolutely delightful. And healthy.  After dinner we both ordered our cheesecake. Yes, they are a bit pricier, but I'm a dessert person and it is always fantastic, so I didn't mind spending more on something I really enjoy.

So then the server came and offered me something in the meantime, but I suggested he offer the woman without the meal - I was the wrong person. I also verified he would be comping her meal, and he said absolutely. Then we never saw him again. He must have been embarrassed and didn't return.  Eventually, almost 15 minutes later another server came and cleared our plates and offered us dessert. By then we just wanted to leave. They missed out on additional orders of drinks and cheesecake by not serving us again.  Then they charged the woman whose meal was missing! But she didn't pay.

Joanna R.,"Washington, DC",91,171,,2.0,8/29/2011,"This is definitely an example of how local, authentic food in Providence triumphs over commercialized, chain restaurants.  A friend was visiting from out of town so we stopped at the Cheesecake Factory for dessert before checking out a movie at the mall. We were seated immediately (I was shocked because normally the wait is at least 20 minutes). The service was fine, nothing exceptional but not horrible. The cheesecake- we both tried two of the more simple offerings, vanilla bean and dulce de leche. Both were delicious and the portions, like everything at Cheesecake Factory, were massive. The waiter recommended that I get coffee ice cream with the vanilla bean (very nice accompaniment) and an espresso martini.  This is where the two star rating comes in. The ice cream was an additional $3, probably didn't need it with all the whipped cream that comes with the cheesecake. My biggest gripe is with the martini. Unlike everything else served at the restaurant, the martini was served in a smaller than normal glass (without the shaker to refill the glass). While we were eating it was OK, but definitely something I wasn't going to order again. It tasted like the bartender used instant coffee and insane amounts of sugar, the amount where you feel like your teeth are going to fall out. The bill arrived and I was shocked to see the price of the martini- $12! One, this isn't NYC. Two, the quality and size were really should have placed it in the $7-8 range. I was insulted that they charged $12 for such a poorly made drink. I know that the Cheesecake Factory is not known for having a hopping bar scene; I just thought that I would receive something a little more interesting.  Overall, the Cheesecake Factory is like a faux designer bag trying to pass itself off as the real thing.

I want to love you but I can't get over the fact that every time I go there is something wrong with someone's meal and I've never had GREAT service, ever! I always order one of three things and it's inevitable that there is always something MISSING from my dish! When the food is good, it's REALLY good but the prices, on a whole, are very high for what you get. But i'm sure most of the cost is for the ""ambiance"" and ""experience"" of the establishment.  I live close by so I tend not to go when I know it's going to be busy because I don't have the patience to wait, there are plenty of other restaurants to go to instead of waiting so long, it IS Providence after all...  My three favorite meals are: Thai Chicken Pasta - always delicious, moist chicken, great sauce Corn Tamales - great taste, rich & creamy, burst of flavors Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad - Fresh, flavorful, filling A pet peeve of mine is that EVERY time I order water (with lemon) I get it in a plastic glass... What, is my water not worthy of a GLASS??? I always have to ASK them to put in it a glass.. (very annoying) Treat all of your beverages equally!! I'm also not so keen on the seating arrangements they have.. I ALWAYS request a booth, I can not stand sitting at a table and have the people sitting next to you practically AT your table..  On occasion I like to treat myself and stop in for a cheesecake to go! The cheesecake is very rich. Some people like it some don't.. Personally, it's good.. I've had better, I've had worse.. but they do have a very large selection! Until we eat again.. NiNi M.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=220
Dan H.,"Boston, MA",85,14,7,3.0,1/27/2013,"I've visited this restaurant numerous times, and every visit seems to be an okay experience. This restaurant is located in downtown Providence, connected to the Providence Shopping Center, Prov Place Mall. Parking is inside the garage and the good thing about that is that there is a door to enter into the restaurant from the garage.  The Cheesecake Factory is always busy, especially on the weekends. The wait for a two person table during dinner time is usually 20-30 minutes. There is so much to choose from the menu list, and it could take hours to decide what you want to eat.  For starters (small plates) I highly suggest that you try something fun and different. I stick to Roast Pear & Blue Cheese Flatbread. For my entree, I love the BBQ Salmon. The flavor is so rich and satisfying. You can't forget to order dessert while you are here. I don't like cheesecake, but I absolutely love the Carrot Cake from here. My next visit, I will look out for the other options, but the overall experience was nothing special. Be prepared to spend about two hours+ when you dine here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=220
Gina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,45,40,3.0,7/21/2011,"This is a chain so despite what I say people are going to know what to expect food wise (all 50 pages worth)....its the service wise I can put my two cents in.  This review should be a 2 due to service but those damn avocado eggrolls and fried mac/cheese balls gets me every time so I gave this experience a 3. The food bumped it up. The thing about Providence is this.. expect that everyone in the state will be going out to eat Friday - Sunday. Thats it. Every single restaurant/take out place is going to be packed. Its like some sort of strange light has been turned on in every person in Rhode Island. GO EAT OUT. Even that Chinese place on the corner you see no one ordering from.. Friday - Sunday they are going to have business. So...fair warning.. unless you want to wait 2+ plus hours at this place to eat on a Friday-Sunday I would go earlier during the week. I went on a Wednesday night (8 pm) and I still waited almost 20 mins for a table outside (which is faster seating but those seats hurt). So my experience: It seems that they got rid of the buzzer notification to let you know that your table is ready. Why?? So the hostess screams your name with so many people around (between the bar and the cheesecake checkout area). Let me warn you to stay close to the hostess area cause you are not going to hear them. No silverware/napkins/plates. We had our apps waiting and getting cold on our table and still no one brought anything over (we had a table of 3). So we asked another waitress and she begrudgingly gave us the utensils and what about the plates I asked for? Oh hm, she dared and asked do you need plates too? I said yes, please. I don't want all of my fried mac and cheese all over my woman shelf thanks very much. Wheres the bread? Granted this wasn't a big deal until I realized every single other table had bread except us. We never got it. It's the point. Hey, I am done...?? I am that type of diner that likes to stack of the plates and the silverware for the runners to make it easier on them. Its also a sign that hey, I am done. Wanna get more money out of me and sell me some cheesecake? Well, our dishes were stacked for a good 15 minutes and our waiter kept on walking right past us. We had to flag him over. Maybe it was an off night..I keep on telling myself but nope I can recant all of the negative service experiences I've had there.

Warned us the 18yr was going to be $22. I said what the heck, it's his birthday - bring us 2.  The 2 shots we got would have been a weak pour if they'd been combined into 1 glass and served as 1 shot. After having had the discussion with the bartender about stepping it up a notch, I was appalled that she gave us such pathetic quantities for so much money. It was unacceptable.

A H.,"Houston, TX",9,83,,2.0,1/23/2014,"I went here in Sept of 2012 as a tourist in RI.  First of all it is located in a mall called Providence Place.  You have to pay park in their garage as there is no street parking.  The crowd in the mall was kind of shady and thug like.  There were straight up thugs hanging out in front of the mall.  Anyway, Cheesecake Factory  is a nice place to go in terms of how clean it is and the fixtures/furniture inside.  From a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being McDonalds and 10 being a place you need reservations 6 months in advance this is a solid 6.  The music is instrumental jazz playing on a loop.  The volume was too loud for me to have a conversation with the other person at my booth at a normal volume.   The service is good; the host and waitress were friendly and welcoming.  The real problem has to do with the prices for what you get.  I ordered a grilled fish dish for $18 and my date got a pasta dish for $17.  It looked like reheated Sysco made food to me.  It was not bad but in places I go in my hometown you get made from scratch food made to order for $12.  Portions are generous and there is a lot of variety and custom combinations for everything.   If the prices were lower and more in line with what you get for what you pay it would be better.  The mall could have more police/security out in plain view to prevent incidents before they start.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-providence?start=220

The food is average, but the servings are large and the prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food you get.  We started with the factory nachos, while my fiancee had the asian chicken salad and I had the orange chicken.  Everything was cooked okay and tasted fine.  You could tell it was just chain food, though, and nothing too special, but, then again, this is to be expected from a chain restaurant, a la Chili's or Fridays.  Our server was perky and efficient, no complaints there. The cheesecake, of which they have an ungodly amount to select from, has always been good, and it was again last night.  One would hope this would be the case, though, since it's in their name.

When we wanted to place our order, we basically had to drag down our server. While our appetizers were delicious, our meals weren't anything special (also served by a different server.) Mine was cold and over cooked and at that point we just wanted to leave. We couldn't even get drink refills, seeing as we hadn't seen our server since he took our orders. After someone came over and told us our server had too many tables to handle, we finally saw him and asked for boxes. When I asked, I told him it was my friends birthday. He replied with, ""oh."" and rolled his eyes. Even though they brought out dessert and sang, I did NOT want to tip 20% and I never want to return.

Yes, CF is a chain restaurant, so there's nothing terribly unique outside of their desserts. Although a crowd, we didnt wait long for a table. During out 20 min wait we saw friends in the bar area and were able to mingle there. I was not impressed with the system used to notify  you of your  table availability. The hotess yells out your name (in a very loud atmosphere). I think this is the cause of the large crowd at the entrance waiting. What ever happen to the flashing beeper technology? Or text me! Please do not scream my name across a crowded, loud restaurant.  The menu was huge and varied which was a plus for me; it seemed to have something for everyone. Our waitress was very nice, but definitely new. I would think with an anticipated crowd on a Friday night they would schedule a more experienced wait staff.  After dinner we chose to get a dessert to take home. We went to the Cheesecake bar to order. This area should be stationed away from the mob waiting to hear their name yelled. There was no distinct line formed, so people stood and just looked at one another trying to see if they were next.  I love the atmosphere and food. I think the service was fine but felt bad for the girl who was obviously new and  flustered.

I've been here six or seven times and it's always the same. As a matter of fact, doesn't really matter the state, it's always formulaic.Um, hence the chain thing.   The dinner salad is gi normous.
