Brad L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",40,13,4,1.0,7/31/2017,"NEVER going back. Over an hour after ordering, our server said she was going to check on the food. Fifteen minutes later, we just asked to have our food packaged 'to go'. A little more than fifteen minutes later she came back with the food. I wish I could show you a picture of the train wreck they put in the containers for me to take home.  I guess I should have been more vocal. I just have a real problem spending $70 for two people to be treated like this. I go out to eat to have a pleasant experience. If I wanted to be treated like crap, I could have stood in line at the DMV and paid for someone else's car registration.  Once I got home, I was so upset, I couldn't even eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=20

Jenn J.,"Redondo Beach, CA",178,188,1560,3.0,8/15/2017,"I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory chain. The food quality (decent, consistent) and quantity (big portions) here are consistent with that of other locations.  Notable mentions that are specific to this location: - View of the docked boats is unique. Can sometimes see seals. Entertaining when they bark and communicate with nearby dogs  - Parking: Only valet or metered parking nearby. For free parking, you'll need to trek quite a few blocks up the hill and into the residential area - Proximity: Close to the Redondo Beach Pier dining, shopping and bar scene While most Cheesecake Factory locations are good for kids, I don't think the restrooms here have been fully thought through with a family in mind. For example, while there is a family bathroom (yay!) and a diaper changing area, there are no paper towels to dry baby hands. FYI - Babies freak out when the super loud air blowers are on and they definitely will not let you stick their tiny arms in the two-hand drying cyclone. They freak out with full force!  ...Pretty please with cherry cheesecake on top: Offer paper towels in the family bathroom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=20
Lilly R.,"Huntington Park, Los Angeles, CA",234,9,35,2.0,12/14/2017,"Im a huge fan of this chain and was extremely excited to enjoy the offerings closer to home. We ordered three apps, two mains, and were planning on getting cheesecake to go.  I was beyond disappointed -- 2/3 apps were incorrect, 1/3 had contamination (blonde hair from maybe the server). I mentioned this to the server and, though she was nice, she did very little to fix the situation and we just asked for the mains instead of reordering the apps. When the mains arrived, my dish was great but my friends was completely at room temp -- how does that even happen? We decided to cut out losses and not waste any more time (diabetic and insulin dependent..  couldn't wait any longer). We paid the bill, including the three apps that we didn't consume as well paid for his steak which also wasn't consumed.  I'm hoping this was a one off but spending nearly $200 on wine and food that we didn't even eat... kind of seems unreasonable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=20

Ever since I was a child, my brother always bragged about the cheesecake factory, well he loves cheesecake. The portions are humungous and so impressive! I ordered the shepherd's pie. Also at our table were orders of pasta, spaghetti, steak, and salad. We could have split the 5-dishes with only 3 and finished our food. Prices are around $15-$20 per entree, so a bit more than the average chain but they try to make up for it with the scrumptious flavors and large portions. This location is always always packed but it's because it's right on the water and fits crowds for birthdays perfectly.

The pancakes are my first favorite... very rich with Ricotta and zesty with the lemon. I've personally tried to make them and they just did not come out the same. The Brioche French Toast is decent and huge. Both are great for sharing.  This popular spot packs a unique breakfast to be tried and tried again.

I've even been alone and that's great, too.  My most recent trip was alone around 3:30 in the afternoon. I was seated next to the window that overlooks the marina and boats. Beautiful spot!  I ordered the Cobb salad which was about the size of Mars, but I'm not complaining! Who complains about TOO much food? It's called a TO-GO box! To go home and enjoy and eat again (which is like typically an hour after I leave the restaurant ;D ).  My server was Travis and he was super kind, attentive, and prompt. He immediately greeted me with bread, water, and even offered his favorite recommendations which I love (more reasons to come back and try new dishes)!  This place can definitely get packed. Like, DMV packed. Just find an awkward time to eat on a weekday and do it. The bar is also self-seating, so opt for that if you can't swim your way to the host/hostesses booth.

Elizabeth K.,"Torrance, CA",19,5,24,3.0,1/7/2018,"The Cheesecake Factory has honestly been one of my favorite restaurants in the South Bay so it makes me feel a bit heart broken writing this, but even though their food is quite good the customer service here is unsatisfactory.  Today was a prime example of a horrible experience I had when I ordered my favorite dish of Eggplant Parmesan and requested that the pesto be replaced with marinara(because of my allergies). The waitress came back a while later saying that the pasta itself was made with pesto and asked if that was okay, I said it wasn't and that I would like regular spaghetti pasta with marinara sauce. We had an understanding or so I thought. About half an hour passes and my meal finally arrives, but it's the wrong order. The waitress that came out with my dish was different from the waitress who took my order so she went to go consult with her about this error. I was out eating lunch with my mom and her order came out just fine(even though her order was modified too) so I told her to eat without me.  The waitress comes back about a minute later and tries to convince me that she made a mistake telling me that the pasta was covered in basil oil, not pesto, so there shouldn't be a problem. She then proceeds to ask me what I am specially allergic to within pesto which made me feel like she was trying to find a reason to get me to eat the incorrect order and not have it remade. I tell her this was not what I ordered and just it's presence in front of me started to give me a lot of anxiety. She retorts that I never said that I wanted marinara on my pasta and that I said I wanted it on my eggplant. Again, this woman was not my original waitress who took my order so I don't know where she got that from and as I even clearly stated before, I told my original waitress that I wanted regular spaghetti with marinara instead of the pesto. However, she kept pinning the blame  on me and looked at me like ""what do you want me to do about it"" so I told her I wasn't comfortable eating this and that I wanted what I ordered. She was obviously annoyed at this point and went back to the kitchen.  My order was brought out again and she asked it was correct, it wasn't, but I said it's fine because I didn't want to cause more of scene then this was already creating. My original waitress came by asking if everything was alright because she noticed that I haven't even touch the food after ten minutes and I tell her that I wanted to take the food home. She could clearly tell I was very upset at this point because I was on the verge of tears out of pure frustration so she quietly packaged it up and left it on our table. I ended up wasting about $20 on a incorrect order I was not satisfied with and what made this all worse was that it's not going to be eaten at all and was literally going to go to waste.  The only good thing that came out of this was the Fried Cheese small plate with marinara sauce I ordered before things went downhill. The Fried Cheese small plate ended up becoming my lunch along with two small slices of the free bread which was sad because I haven't eaten all day and was looking forward to a meal, not a snack with a side of attitude from that waitress.  The wait for the small plates was about 20 minutes while the main course took an additional 30 minutes. My mom actually ended up falling asleep waiting for the food to arrive which I thought was sad that service was slow enough that there was time for a nap.  Valet parking is available and is $4 during the day and goes up at night. There is also street parking available which I believe is about $1.50 or $1.75 an hour which may be cheaper than valet depending on how long you plan on staying so make sure to bring quarters. There is also a great view of the marina and it's especially beautiful during sunset. The lighting inside the restaurant itself is quite dim so it's best to come during the day time when there is a lot of natural light if you want the best pictures of your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach
Vicki A.,"El Segundo, CA",1,9,2,4.0,12/22/2017,"Went for a business meeting with three of us. Arrived at the restaurant at opening on a Friday, 11:30 a.m. and it was already getting busy. My only complaint is about the huge size of the menu; really too big! So I gave up on that and ordered from the Skillylicious menu which is their collection of fresh options with lower calories.  I had a garden salad - small - that was not small at all. Very tasty. Enough veggies - carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes  and zucchini - that I didn't even need dressing. Nor could I finish it.  For the main course, I had Shrimp Summer Rolls. There were 4 - 6 wrapped rolls with asparagus, shrimp, mushroom, cilantro and rice noodles served with peanut dipping sauce. There was too much food to finish.  The two others I was with enjoyed theirs as well. One of the gentlemen was on a very restrictive diet and requested much of it on the side and our server had no problems with any of the requests. She was super prompt and polite and her service was excellent.  I recommend The Cheesecake Factory for a nice lunch overlooking the harbor. The view was excellent! Sort of know what you want to eat or expect to spend 15 minutes reading the choices. Although we skipped it this time, the cheesecake is also excellent with white raspberry chocolate being my favorite.  Valet parking is $2.50 or you could probably park not right in the harbor at no cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach
Max S.,"Palos Verdes Estates, CA",407,167,1749,4.0,11/4/2017,"I came here with coworkers during lunch on Friday, which turned out to be a great time to come. It has been a while since I have come to this particular Cheesecake Factory because it is extremely busy in the evenings and on the weekends.  Their location is great, right next to the marina. They have limited free, self parking. The rest of the parking lot is valet, which costs $2.50.  The food portions are still big. I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad off their Skinnilicious menu, which is a nice alternative. This menu offers meals that are fewer in calories than the regular menu. It was a pretty large salad; I couldn't eat it all. Yet, I still ordered dessert, the Coffee and Cream Chocolate Cheesecake.

Antonio M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1016,180,1195,4.0,12/18/2017,"What is there not to like about The Cheesecake Factory?!?!? The menu is HUGE, you can literally order anything you can think of! From fish tacos to burgers to pizza to salads to breakfast items. I love going here and the Mdr location is amazing. The one thing I do not like is that if you dine outside the menu is limited. I don't get that, just because you are a few more feet away from the kitchen the chefs are able to make that ""one"" meal for you? But either way, I love this spot. Caesar salad here is a must for me. The wheat bread is absolutely my favorite with the caesar salad.  Their burgers are all very good! NY Strip is actually very delicious.

I liked the new snacks and small plates menu along with the new specialties. We ordered a few small plates to sample like chicken nuggets, edamame, skinnylicious salmon roll and Korean spicy cauliflower, they were very comforting and flavorful. Hubby had carne asada steak medallions, they overcooked it the first time but the second time was done right that hubby liked his steak so much.

Kat M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",673,731,348,2.0,7/30/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!  Their cheesecake is my absolute favorite, and I eat it regularly.  However, the food at this location has continued to decline.  (Other Cheesecake Factories have not had this decline.) Recent Complaints during several different meals (We used to dine here regularly until now): 1. I had a rubber band in my food.  The manager came over and said that the rubber band was from the cilantro, and it accidentally made it's way into my food.  He apologized, but did not offer us any compensation.  I was on a lovely date with my hubby and did not want to cause an issue, so I held my tongue until now.  I literally had to pull a purple rubber band out of my mouth and wasn't even offered a dessert. 2. My artichoke had paper in it that said artichoke.  The waitress comped this without us having to ask.  This made me lose my appetite.  3. My miso salmon, which I usually love, was overcooked.  It still tasted good enough, so I did not complain.  I was on another date with my hubby, and wanted to just enjoy my evening with him. 4. Today my cheesecake had paper in it.  I pulled it out of my mouth, unrolled it, and discussed it with my server.  She apologized and said that the cakes come with this paper to separate the cheesecakes.  I did not make a deal about it. 5. My salad today had almost no chicken.  I thought the kitchen forgot the chicken.  I was showing our server that they forgot the chicken, when I finally spotted a piece after moving the salad at least 5-6 times searching for chicken with my fork.  She had the manager give us more chicken.  The rest of the salad was seriously lacking in ingredients.  There was a skimpy amount of corn, beans and cheese.  We just ate at the Pasadena location twice, and their Santa Fe salad was amazing.  I don't like paying $16 for lettuce. I still LOVE their cheesecakes, but this location has lost my business until they CLEAN up their act.  I don't appreciate finding rubber bands and paper in my food on a somewhat regular basis.  I was only offered something to make up for these faux pas 1/3 times I found foreign objects in my food.  This location is skimpy on their ingredients. The cheesecake is still AMAZING =).  The new Celebration Cheesecake is yummy and fun!  The view is very pleasant, ocean and sailboats.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach

Since this was a Thursday night we were seated right away.  Our server Gerardo G was beyond awesome... such a friendly and amazing guy.  We ordered and the food came rather quickly.  My friend had the meatloaf and I had the pasta carbonara with chicken. He raved about the meatloaf; however, while the pasta carbonara had plenty bacon and the noodles were hot and fresh the sauce was kinda bland. Maybe I am too picky, but I would try it again.

They have a very tiny self parking majority of time you will have to valet park since they have a bigger lot. Coming on a Sunday or Saturday for brunch to sit inside can be a wait from 45 to a hour during the brunch time 10am- 2pm we sat out in patio which was less of a wait. Service is ok food wise can be slow but service in general was good. I ordered the lunch pasta special for the pasta with shrimp and sausage minus the onions and peppers but it was still spicy for me now I know next time to stick with the shrimp and angel pasta or the four cheese pasta. Also got a Godiva chocolate cheesecake to go hopefully that won't disappoint later on.

After 10 minutes, our server came up and just acted nonchalant and kind of seemed careless, lacking energy. He didn't even apologize for the long wait.

Selah D.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/9/2018,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. A few girls and I went to grab drinks and there skinny Long Island ice tea tasted terrible. The the waitress named Virginia who had already been giving us attitude & She was visibly annoyed when we took one sip and asked to exchange the drink for a skinny mojito and went to tell her manager. The manager Ray proceeded to come over to our table and speak to us like we were kindergarteners in a condescending tone about how skinny drinks ""taste different and he's confused on why we sent them back""  We simply told him. The taste of the skinny Long Island tasted bad and we just want something else. He was not satisfied with that answer and kept nagging us on more info. Now people in the restaurant are staring, we can't enjoy our time together and we are agitated. So we tell him he has ruined our evening and we are leaving. 3 out of us 4 girls DID NOT EVEN TOUCH THE DRINKS because he was reprimanding us the whole time so we told him to take everything back and we're not paying. When we go to leave, 2 of his staff (Antoinette & Virginia) come running after us accusing us of a dine & dash and Antoinette starting using the F word at us. The manager Ray comes out & it takes a whole other 15mins to resolve! Ray goes on to a long sermon about how his bartender is a veteran and has been making drinks for years and he's so confused as to why several girls didn't like their drink. I have never in my life gone somewhere and if you order something and you do not like it , that they will not let you return it in exchange for something else.

Alyse T.,"Torrance, CA",207,158,859,3.0,6/15/2017,"Cheesecake Factory can be counted on for consistently good food, ambiance and service, and this location is no exception. Their ridiculously large menu and excellent view of the ocean makes this a great place to celebrate a special occasion.  I came here on a Sunday for dinner to celebrate my mom's birthday. We were seated right away at a nice table with a view. I split two appetizers with my boyfriend. We ordered: Avocado Toast: Cheesecake Factory is trying to hop onto this trendy bandwagon. Their version is a bit underwhelming. They take the standard bread they give you before the meal, toast the crap out of it, then pile some avocado on top. The bread is simply too hard and thick to eat easily. Otherwise it's quite tasty.  Samosas: this appetizer comes with 4 small pieces. They're fried nicely and have a good curry flavor. The yogurt sauce was pretty good too.  The service was excellent as per usual. They gave my mom a complimentary sundae and sang happy birthday to her. Pricing is the same as every other location - the good thing is generally the portions are so large you get two meals out of it.

Selena D.,"Chino, CA",3,57,35,3.0,12/19/2017,I've heard amazing things about this restaurant. My cousin actually works here so I was given a whole list of dishes I HAD TO try and had to stay away from. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. The food is so pricey and I know you get what you pay for and you definitely get enough but I almost feel like you get too much. I know that's not what someone typically would complain about but it was too much for bf and I. Then again I guess it could be related to that fact that they give free bread and who the hell doesn't love free bread??? CRAZY PEOPLE Thats who ! But I do have to say their service is top notch. That is why I give them 3 stars. Another reason I docked two stars is because I do not feel their food was of the best quality. I would expect better quality if I am paying that much for it.

I used to always say that's one big chain restaurant that almost always delivers a positive experience. Sadly not true anymore. Sorta like buca di beppo (what in the world happened to that place?). Even though I asked for an inside table, the hostess suggested first available as it would be a long wait. Our buzzer went off quickly then we were sent through a parade of empty tables and booths inside to literally the farthest table outside. The waiter there visited us once every 30 min or so. And even apologized repeatedly and thanked us for being patient. Which was weird because it was a Thursday night at 9pm and it wasn't that busy.  Food was ok. About the level of BJ'S. But rather expensive for the level of food which is a glamorized Dennys.  The kicker was everyone in our party had diarrhea all night.

Food arrived hot and fast, though the bar took a little while on our margarita. The margarita was TWICE as big and TWICE as strong than Marina del Rey, so we'd go back to this location just for the cocktail generosity. Our server was OK---definitely a personality clash with us.  I think he thought he was being funny or witty, but sounded more condescending than anything.   Things were said like ""whoa, that's a lot of food"" and ""man, that steak didn't have a chance, huh?!?""  were just not appreciated by us as we were eating, especially since the tone came across as very judgmental.    Other things were said but I think in this case we just wanted him to shut up and stop interrupting with his snarky comments.

We had to ask for it because kids love it and I felt embarrassed by the look I got when I asked for it. We had to ask for straws several times. We ordered some appetizers and some dishes to share. After we placed the order the waitress asked ""that's all?"" with a tone that was more ""you are ordering three appetizers and two main dishes and two kids meals  for 3 people and two kids, that is not enough""! So I told her yes if it is ok we would only like to order what we just told you. All the food came at the same time. All of that would not be a big deal but after 10 min the waitress started showing up every 3-4 minutes cleaning the table and asking if want to order more food or drinks. She took my half full glass of lemonade and I had to tell her I am not done we barely started eating. We told her everything is fine and then she came while I literally had my fork in my mouth and my kids were in the middle of their dinner asking ""should I box up anything for you""? That was 12-15 min after the food came. We used to eat here every Sunday but their new service made sure we are not returning. We spent 20 min waiting and 30 min sitting here including waiting for the food to be brought out.

I saw a lot of couples on dates and anniversaries here while I dined with family. The hostess was very pleasant and sat us right away. 6pm on a weekday is the perfect time to come as when we were leaving around 7.30, there was a line out the door.  Our server David was very nice but all his ""lines"" seemed rehearsed. He misinformed us about an appetizer we ordered but he was very gracious and apologetic when I pointed it out. It wasn't a big deal. 5 stars for him.  The food here is never that great but people come because they're BIG PORTIONS. Mashed potatoes with the shrimp scampi was delicious. The chicken piccata was good too but after a while you get sick of it cos it's very rich. Jambalaya pasta, STAY AWAY if you've ever had jambalaya elsewhere or even know what it is. The jambalaya here should be renamed as chicken with bell peppers (not spicy at all).  All in all it was a pleasant experience. I've been here about 10 yrs ago when I first moved to the US. Wasn't impressed then, isn't impressed now. The service is what gave this place my 4 stars.

Tiffany L.,"Torrance, CA",2,63,,4.0,11/6/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is pretty much self-explanatory.  This huge restaurant chain serves so much good food. The menu has so much to choose from so there is always a hit-or-miss menu (for example, orange chicken and Jamaican black pepper shrimp). But, there's always more good food than bad ones. Whenever we go to visit, we love to order spicy chipotle pasta (which is a must-order dish!), crispy crab bites, nashvill hot chicken nuggets, roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread, crab and artichoke dip, miso salmon, steak diane, and bang bang chicken and shrimp. We go to the Cheesecake Factory every once a month so we tried so many other dishes as well but cannot remember all at the moment.  The portion sizes are large enough to share with everyone at the table.  There is nothing to say about their original cheesecake because it's just so good and melts in your mouth.  Customer service is excellent. However, during lunch hours the service is noticeably more slower for some reason. They are always packed on holidays and wait is little long on weekend nights so always try to go on weekdays for better food and service.

Ashley C.,"Grand Terrace, CA",21,7,4,5.0,5/22/2017,"This review is specific for the special events team. This past April I had my wedding reception on the 2nd floor of the Cheesecake Factory. Jackie, Addie and Danny were all great at staying in communication with me during the planning process. Unfortunately I procrastinated and in the last 2 weeks I had to bombard them with e-mails to follow up on last minute items. They were all very professional and helped me plan everything to the last minute.  I was also concerned because the restaurant is still open during the whole event and I was worried I would feel like we did not have enough privacy. However on the day of the event we had all the privacy we needed. Our dj was still able to blast his music, we danced, talked and was able to be loud if we wanted. The food was great and best of all very affordable for the area.  My wedding was everything I visioned it to be and it would not have been possible without the staff and amazing space that the Cheesecake Factory provided.

The Valet even pointed us to an area where parking is free. (avoiding the 4$ charge) Not only that, one of the servers (who brought out our dishes + showered the pasta in cheese) went out of his way to bring our table Sriracha, even though for some reason the bottle exploded on him when he opened it!

I would definitely recommend bringing a date or your mama here :)  yum: -Sweet Corn Tamale cakes (has sour cream, salsa, avocado & salsa verde). It reminds me of corn bread, with a twist! -Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (has chicken, asparagus, peppers, peas, garlic, etc). This pasta dish has so many different textures, and comes in abundance!

They don't allow everyone to be seated until the entire party here but luckily the people we were meeting up with were already there. Never been there at night, but the interior was dimly lit, great for an intimate date night out. Unfortunately, the place we were sat didn't have any direct light over so reading the menu and eating got to be a little difficult. We started off with the chicken taquitos, the Nashville nuggets, and the calamari. The chicken tacquitos were great, definitely a huge upgrade compared to any hole in the wall Mexican take out place. Nashville nuggets had a spicy flavor that went great with the ranch it came in. The entree I got was the chicken maderie with the herb crusted salmon. Came with a side of mashed potatoes and string beans. The salmon could've used some more salt/flavor, but the sauce that the chicken came with went great with the mushrooms on the side. For desert we had the cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, and the apple pie, damn we were stuffed. The cheesecake was pretty dense but delicious, whereas the tiramisu cheesecake was much lighter.

Don't forget to order a slice of cheesecake! TIP: Only eat half of your meal so you can get the yummy dessert =) The slices are HUGE and I generally share with a couple people (and we don't always finish). They have a good sized banquet room and bar upstairs. We almost had our wedding reception here (they can set up your ceremony there too) but it could not accommodate our 200+ guest list.

Looked like someone wasn't wiping down properly,  just pushed the food off the table onto the seats and floor.  Bang Bang chicken- Dry dry chicken. Wife sent it back for a chicken Parm sandwich which Was decent but not something she really wanted. Just played it safe with the usual which is the sandwich.  Jamaican Black Shrimp- good. Saucy. A little kick. Good plate here.  Drinks. Two Sodas. Refilled once.  Dessert. Black Out Cake- Good any day.  Waiter was all over the place. The poor guy was very tired. He had taken over for the original who first saw us when we seated but then had to go since his shift was over. So this new guy took over and he apologized to  us and the two tables beside us for his lack of service, but he said he was overwhelmed by to many tables he already has at the same time. So it became a waiting game for anything after the drinks. The waiter was sweating tired I saw his face giving up. I really wanted to help him. So I never asked for anything more. We just waited to catch him in a breather and then I'd ask.  To cut it short. This waiter was obviously over worked. Someone should have helped him. But no one did. Where is the supervisor?

Then for dinner I ordered chicken marsala with pasta.  There was so much parsley sprinkled into the food after cooking it was all I could taste.  When I mentioned to the server she looked at my plate and agreed with me - that was all she did.  We also had to ask for bread. The cheesecake was good as expected. The 'birthday sundae' was nice - but the fudge was so rock hard it couldn't be spooned out.  My dad also had ice cream with fudge and had the same issue.

The name tells the truth, it us a factory. A factory of yumminess. Cheesecakes in such a wide variety of flavors, it tickles the mind. So many possibilities. Just one mouth. However can you decide? Can't help you with that one. But just reading all the cheesecakes is a marvelous thing.  But there is more, with real food that is interesting and tasty. Great appetizers and small plates, for times when you are hungry for just something small and yummy. They bring you free bread and butter. The bread changes a little, but it usually includes the dark soft squaw bread and it's yummy.  My favorite appetizer is the Stuffed Mushrooms with it's fontina and parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a yummy sauce. White Bean Hummus served with warm flatbread, is worth trying. The Beets With Goat Cheese is really good, made with fresh beets, apples, baby arugula, pecans and vinaigrette. The Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip is sooooooo good, and the grilled sourdough bread they serve it with is a great pairing. Yum. When I am feeling virtuous I order the Kale Salad, with cranberries, apples, marcona almonds and green beans, with a yummy buttermilk black pepper dressing. It is so yummy, it doesn't feel like diet food, it tastes like I am indulging. My friend swears by the Kobe Burger, with its American style kobe beef with sauteed mushrooms and onions on wonderful fresh bread. He says he craves it. I believe him. His face looks so blissful when he is eating it. They offer huge portions. Bang Bang Chicken is not to be missed. The Chinese Chicken Salad is yummy and enough for three meals. The Orange Chicken is the best Orange Chicken-EVER. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta is as interesting as it is delicious, with lots of layers of flavors and textures, with asparagus, peppers, peas, garlic, with perfectly prepared pasta and seasoning. They have seasonal favorites and such a huge menu. So many choices. Ordering always takes a long time. Always a dilemma, to try an old favorite or venture out and try something new?  Great views of the ocean and the marina. Lovely sunsets, if you time it right. They have indoor and patio seating. They have a wonderful special events rooms upstairs. They have a friendly cheerful wait staff. They have a bar and you can wait here, if you are waiting for a table. Great food, great service and predictably amazing cheese cakes and desserts. Really, if they just had the spellbinding White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, I'd keep going back. It's that delicious. Don't take my word for it, go and taste it for yourself.

After we got some food bagged up by our server, we went to the cheesecake counter. Ashlyn greeted us and I asked her for two Oreo cheesecakes. She rung me up and handed me my receipt. I didn't give her any tip because she didn't show me why she deserved one. All she did was push a few buttons. She hadn't done anything. So when she sees she got no tip she decided to take her sweet ass time in getting said cheesecake. It took her 10 mins (I counted) for her to give us our cheesecake. Mind you, WE WERE THE ONLY INES THERE AT THE COUNTER. There was NO ONE else in line. It was about 4:30pm on 4/18/17. Just my boyfriend and I and Ashlyn. What she could have done to receive a tip was get my order, show me how quick she could get it to me and how efficiently. Instead she did the opposite. Then when I took my bag and told her thank you she gave me an eye roll. Advise to management: reprimand and retrain her. Everyone else in the restaurant was super pleasant but her. Update: after the manager of the Cheesecake Factory reached out, I have to update my review. They seemed genuinely concerned that I had poor customer service from one person.

Came here to celebrate with my parents and the hubby, only to look back and say, ""It sounded like the perfect spot at the time!"" Brunch with a view, refreshing drinks & their infamous (red velvet) cheesecakes, what can possibly go wrong?!  Well let me tell ya...pretty much, customer service was a huge let down and food was average. I had high expectations from the last time I've been but I guess I was wishful thinking. The customer service we received in San Diego was way better. It's been a while but I totally remember how exceptional they were--quick and on top of things the whole time we were there.  On our visit to this location, we arrived right at opening so the parking lot was still empty--3 to 4 cars tops. No need for the valet. We walked in and had to wait 5 minutes to be seated. Not bad. We weren't on a time crunch.  We chose to sit at the outdoor patio for the beautiful view. Just our luck, other groups had the same idea. If only I knew we were going to be stuck with ONE server and she has to serve 5 or more tables all at once, best believe I would've asked to move back inside instead. It bothered me the most but my group didn't seem to mind so much until later on. Our server forgot multiple requests we had asked her to do/bring over to the table, so we had to constantly remind her. She was multitasking okay-ish at the beginning but she could've also asked for back up.  Anyways, food was a wait as well. But that, I didn't care so much. Thankfully, they had warm breads and butter for the table as starters. We also added the avocado eggrolls as appetizers. It looked the most appealing off the menu but it was okay. I didn't like how their menu was never-ending too. IDK if that's just me. It made it so difficult to choose. Options are great but it was time-consuming. My entire group found ourselves flipping through back and forth and we kept changing our minds...basically, we had to settle. I didn't like that.  I wanted to like CF, i really did. Our experience just wasn't as great. We ordered desserts for take out and ordered at the counter. Damn, I don't remember the slices being so expensive. The ladies behind the counter wasn't as cheerful either. C'mon now, the day just started. Be happy?

Cecilia M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,20,4,3.0,1/10/2017,Well I was going to complain about the extortion I encountered at the valet but I just looked at other reviews and saw many of the same complaints. I almost always carry cash just in case but this time I forgot to bring some. Cash only valet which you find out after they have your car and keys. I was directed to shade hotel (New by the way) what did they do prior?? The ATM charged 5.00 does the valet owner operate that ATM?? Then my bank charged me another 2.50.  The food and fun at Cheesecake Factory is basic family friendly fun. Menu with something for everyone. The valet service here is completely unnecessary and therefore dampens the experience. Not to mention dodging bikes and pedestrians on the way in.

I commented about how dark our table was and the fact that I needed a flashlight to see the menu (not joking).  The table next to us was really annoying as well with a bunch of teens mindlessly backing up into my bf w/ their chairs like they were the only ones in the restaurant. Basically, I was being a negative Nancy and expecting the same bored service on top of being next to these obnoxious kids, lord! Thankfully, Rachel was super sweet and also not just sweet but interactive without being intrusive.

It's sooo good. Their cheesecakes are definitely on the heavy and rich side but so satisfying  for some reason, everything I have ordered here comes a little bit too salty but I don't mind since I like salt. I love love love their brown (is it wheat??) bread that they serve before you receive your meal. I've never had an issue with customer service here, bathrooms are always clean, and it's right by the ocean.

The wait was rather short which was lovely since it was only a friend and I, but once we were seated it took forever to get a waiter to take our drink orders. After we got our drinks and had ordered our food, it took about an hour to actually get our food. I ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, which I've had before at other locations, and it was very over seasoned to the point where it wasn't appetizing. Throughout our lunch we only were checked on once and our drinks were never refilled.

James K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",251,26,,2.0,3/19/2017,"First, this review is not indicative of the service. The waitstaff were amazing, and that is something the Cheesecake Factory should be proud of. I would give 5 stars for our server Adrian I believe?  He was on top of everything and a real polished pro who understands that good service is how he earns more money.   The hostess station was not so pleasant, nor very informative. When we called, she could not give us an idea how long we might wait said she ""could not predict the future.""  I think if you work enough nights at a place (that annoyingly takes no reservations) you could give a ballpark estimate about how long a guest should expect to wait. I think we don't need Nostradamus to predict the future but maybe since that is part of your job,  maybe be aware of how long folks may expect to wait. Not brain surgery it's customer service.  You might know the average wait time because your restaurant doesn't take reservations, this is the worst, most annoying part of this establishment. I cannot believe folks wait so long for basically a glorified Denny's. Food is good, portions are hearty, but you wont feel great afterwards. There is a ton of butter and oil in the Scampi. Chicken Romano is good, sandwiches all good, not amazing but good fatty American food.   Inside: It is dark, a little too dark for me. And we were seated next to the door to somewhere  outside that made it feel like we were in a wind tunnel every 25 seconds when it opened.  I felt like I was in a cave with the dim lights, stone tables and floors. This could have been a much better review but the first people one has to deal with, need to be a little more aware of what they are doing and if you expect folks to wait over an hour I would try a little tenderness and not be so matter of fact or even a little bit unpleasant to folks.

Let me begin by saying that The Cheesecake Factory is MY FAVORITE restaurant and I have gone there for my birthday every year for the last 12 years. Mistake - attending the redondo beach location.  I ordered the buffalo wings which are usually, AMAZING.. They were dry and tasted old like they had been under a hearing lamp for hours. They didn't even LOOK appetizing.  Next, I ordered a signature dish I've had a million times - chicken and shrimp gumbo. I could tell when it was first brought to me something was wrong because it looked orange and creamy more like a curry. Tasted like tomato sauce with cream - awful. I took 1 bite and sent it back and ordered nothing else.  My boyfriend ordered he Jamaican black pepper shrimp and chicken, another dish I've had a ton of times. The brown rice was mushy and WAY over cooked and same goes for the plantains - They LOOKED burnt, but were soggy and dry than the sahara desert. Chicken was dry... I normally get cheesecake but I was so turned off by the food, I decided to play it safe and just go home. The service was good and he was patient with our unhappiness  and the drinks were excellent.. Unfortunately the most important part is THE FOOD. WILL NEVERRRRRR ATTEND THIS LOCATION AGAIN AND I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST WASTING YOUR MONEY HERE, go to the Cheesecake Factory on Ventura in Sherman oaks, worth the drive to avoid this mediocrity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=120

The truth is that the food was great but the service was terrible. It took the manager one hour to advise us that they ran out of salmon and that they would not be serving the dish for one of my guest. What really did it was that when I informed the manager that we were displeased about the amount of time it took to let us know, over an hour, was not acceptable. The manager  raised her voice and responded with attitude, frowned red face and said; ""It is not our fault the person before us beat us to the last salmon"". That was incorrect because the person who did not order enough salmon for that night dropped the ball and that person was at fault. Dont know who makes the orders of food and fish, my guess it was the same restaurant manager that displayed unprofessionalism and disregard for care and service for their guest. Additionally, when they brought out the salad I informed one of the waiters that the salad she had in her hand was for my father, sitting across from me, but she  continued to ask another waiter who the salad was for. The waiter pointed at my father confirming what I had just told her who that salad was for. She disregarded my advise, ignored me and proceeded without an apology.

We were seated next to a bussing station, which I know would piss people off, but no!  One server was throwing her plates into the bus bin. There was major complaining going on between employees, and it was just plain dirty and gross. The hardest working guy in there who gave it his all was the bus boy and even after he finished cleaning up after all of the sloppy servers, they would seriously just carelessly drop $h!t on the floor again.

Jon D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1045,148,15,4.0,11/3/2015,Went for dinner with my baby to redeem a gift card. We went on Saturday night during Halloween which was awesome! While most were out trick or treating the streets were quiet and so it was easy to find parking and get seating on an otherwise busy evening.  Our server Wendy was nice courteous and professional. We started with a fresh house salad and bread with olive oil. My girl had tempura shrimp with flatbread pizza which was tasty and delicious. A bit on the heavy side but tasty nonetheless.  I had the veggie burger on brioche with fries. The bun was a little thick but the burger was well cooked. We finished with a seven later chocolate cake which was decadently rich but more like seventeen layers. We're still finishing it today.  Will definitely be back and this time will eat a little lighter. The only real challenge is that there are almost too many choices and the portions are too large.

My friend and I made the mistake of ordering an appetizer AND filling ourselves up with bread before the main entree came out, resulting in us taking most of the main entree home.  Just keep in mind that all their dishes are fairly large and that the bread has endless refills.  The bread at Cheesecake Factory is some of my favorite, especially the wheat type.  The bread comes out very fresh and hot, making the butter easy to melt and spread.  We ordered the Mac N' Cheese bites which is essentially Mac N' Cheese pasta in a fried dough ball.  I expected some bit size balls but each of the fried dough balls were about the size of an apple!  The Mac N' Cheese has a creamy cheesy taste and the fried dough balls are placed in creamy marinara sauce.  All in all, I would recommend this appetizer, but maybe with more than 2 people because the dish comes with 4 fried dough balls and are pretty filling.  I ordered the Herb-Crusted Chicken which was essentially a chicken encrusted with herbs and cheese.  The chicken came with sides of mashed potatoes and green beans.  The dish was tasty but I was too full to finish the rest of the dish after our filling appetizers.  The green beans were pretty tasteless and unappetizing to me though; they had absolutely no flavor and tasted like they had simply just been blanched.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a nice family establishment that many people often visit for celebrations and events.  I also highly recommend saving some room for their many flavors of cheesecake, of course.  Cheesecake Factory's dishes are a bit expensive but for the setting and size of the dishes, I would say that it's worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=140
Denise B.,"Long Beach, CA",36,237,120,2.0,12/13/2016,"i love this place but this time my experience was poor. I had a giftcard for my birthday I had been saving till me and my husband could go on a date night. We finally used it in November. We came in around 6 right before the Saturday dinner rush. We were seated right next to the kitchen with someone who was training someone else. We ordered apps... the tex mex spring rolls. They  came out soggy and oily. We also ordered our food with the apps so everything could be prompt. I ordered the catfish and my husband a pasta dish. We waited 45 mins for our food. We finally asked our servers what happened. He went to the back and came out with our food. Mine was cold. Idk if they gotten forgotten or what?! Since we waited so long I contemplated should I return it or just deal with it since my husband got his food i didnt want to wait with nothing. I sent the food back. We waited 10 mins than my Jamaican dish came out. It was better than the 1st things I ordered but it just sucked to eat alone. My husbands food was salty so he didnt continue with his. i also didnt like that when I ordered a refill of my cucumber lemonade I could tell they didnt make another cucumber lemonade, he just poured lemonade on top of my ice and left over cucumbers from the first drink--lame. The manager took off the first dish I sent back. Since we dont get out much I wish our experience would have been better.

Borzoo H.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",42,90,116,4.0,3/28/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is the kind of restaurant you go back to week after week because it's so good and they have so many options to choose from. They was over 200 menu items so you are bound to find something you like   The food is a great value considering the huge portions you get. The food is always consistently great, but the same is not true about the service.  The service is good most of the time but sometimes it can be pretty bad. TIP: do not sit outside at this location. The service has always been so bad whenever we sat outside.  I usually get the miso salmon with mashed potatoes instead of rice, which is $19.99. The portion is huge. One of my favorite dishes.  The side of Mac n cheese, which is almost $7. Is the best Mac n cheese I have ever had. It's so cheesy and saucy it's sooooooooooo good.  ANOTHER TIP: if you want the salad get the garden salad. It's 6$ and almost the size of an entree salad.  Some other great dishes are any pizza, eggplant parmigiana, four cheese pasta, almond crusted salmon salad and avocado egg rolls.  This is one of my favorite places to eat. If they can just perfect the service it would be the BEST place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=140

B B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/18/2017,"Worst restaurant experience!  We waited about 40 minutes to be seated.  After being seated our waitress brought us two glasses of water (for a table of 6).  When we asked for two more waters without lemon she brought us hot water (no lemon, but no ice either).  All of this, lwhile being seated on the patio at a table that had little to no umbrella cover on a sunny day.  The view was great, so I don't sound too negative. Food was sad. I ordered the honey truffle chicken, which looked so good in the advertisement.  It was bland and the asparagus had nothing on it. It was like food you receive with a dietary restriction. My husband ordered the salmon and shrimp.  They looked so sad on the plate, one tiny piece of salmon and about four small shrimp artistically placed on the canvas of a plate with asparagus and fries. Next, my son orders the spaghetti and meatballs, and receives poorly sauced spaghetti with a burnt (black) meatball.  When I told the waitress about the spaghetti she looked at me and said nothing. I had to ask if we could get another meatball because my son had not touched his food. She took the meatball and brought us a new one ( Too bad it was the end of our meal) and comp'd my son's meal).  But for me, it was too late. Refills on drinks (what is that!????) We ended up getting cheesecake to go, which was the highlight of the legendary ""Cheesecake Factory"".   Overall, I won't be eating at this Cheesecake Factory and sadly to say I most likely will be getting my cheesecake to go from any other location.  This one experience has tainted my ideal view of Cheesecake Factory.  They look so nice and delicious, but my experience was not worth the money, time or aggravation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=140

Melisa C.,"Monterey Park, CA",218,170,67,4.0,1/9/2016,"Somehow I almost always end up here whenever my parents are in town to visit and it's not even because of the cheesecake! FOOD: I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci and I had them substitute the penne pasta for bow-tie pasta this time. They can substitute for other pastas as well which is a nice option. Portion size is pretty big here and it's often hard for me to finish what I order. You can always take part of it home though so you can save some room for a slice of cheesecake :) The Pasta Da Vinci comes with sautéed chicken, mushrooms, and onions in a wine sauce. The chicken is tender and slightly crispy at the edges. Overall most pieces aren't too dry to eat comfortably. The sauce has a hint of sweetness to it and you can barely taste the wine. Solid dish. One of my favorites when the pasta doesn't come swimming in sauce which is what happened this time unfortunately. In general the pasta dishes here are usually quite oily and the sauce quite heavy so I like to request for the sauce on the side. It's a hit or miss with this request because sometimes they get it right and sometimes they don't. When it does, I'd give it a 4/5, otherwise like this time, unfortunately it'd only be a 3/5. Overall: 3/5 SERVICE: Usually within a few minutes of sitting down, someone comes by to drop off some warm bread to snack on. It's always nice when you have to wait a bit for your server to come, which is typical for a Friday or Saturday night. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive and our server checked up on us from time-to-time. Overall: 4/5 DECOR/AMBIANCE: Casual. They try to make the restaurant more upscale by dimming the lights at night and having a heated outdoor patio. The restaurant is situated at a nice spot overlooking the bay but you can't see much at night. There is a bar area off to the right where people can watch sports and grab drinks. You can also eat there as well if you don't mind smaller tables. Some of the tables in the restaurant itself are a bit small and it can get cramped, especially if you're at a table for 2. Overall: 4/5 There is a parking lot out front but it is valet only unfortunately. There are a handful of spots to the right of the lot for people picking up to-go orders. If you're lucky maybe you can snag one of the metered parking spots along the street on Harbor Drive or park by the pier and walk over. Overall a casual, kid friendly place that's perfect for parties and dinners with friends and family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=140
Katrina D.,"Torrance, CA",245,40,46,4.0,6/12/2016,"Never have I been disappointed at a Cheesecake factory. Parking: Ever since Redondo Beach did the street renovations, street parking hasn't been great.  Parking has become more limited to the valet ($4 + tip), or the self-park lot if you're lucky...I'm never lucky, or I'm just too hungry to wait for someone to leave, lol. Service: **RESERVATIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTED, so always inquire about the wait if you know you won't be able to sit and wait for a table** The service at this particular location has always been great, and the servers have always been very attentive.  I've noticed that the bar area tends to get less attention, so sometimes you'll just have to flag down any server you can make eye contact with, but otherwise they're pretty good.  They pack your leftovers too, and are always happy to check with the kitchen if you're concerned about substitutions based on preference or dietary need. They accommodate large parties here, and are also really great when it comes to hosting large events upstairs.  I had my grad luncheon here and they're fantastic at helping you plan and really make it exactly how you want it (e.g. linens, decorations, menu, etc.). Happy Hour:  Happy hour is 4-6pm, and they have a pretty decent selection of appetizers and drinks.  Really sad that they removed the calamari from the happy hour menu, but happy to say that the avocado egg rolls are still there!  Fun fact: portion sizes during happy hour are the same as in the normal dining area, so be prepared to get stuffedddd. Food: PORTIONS ARE HUGE...and they also offer complimentary squaw and sourdough bread with butter.  Contrary to the more upscale restaurants, Cheesecake factory offers scenic waterfront dining where you can ALSO get your money's worth when it comes to portion sizes.  Most dishes average about $16-$18, but I almost always leave with leftovers.   There's a ridiculously large selection of chicken dishes, but they're consistently prepared and yummy.  The chicken piccata, chicken bellagio, chicken stuffed tortillas, and moroccan chicken are all great. The appetizers are pretty well-sized for a family of 4/possibly 5 if you're eating it along with the endless bread.  Desserts are obviously cheesecake or cheesecake, lol.  Personally, I'm anti-cheesecake, so I can't say whether or not they're good.  However, I've dined with enough people who love it, so it's probably worth it.

The scenery was very relaxing and pleasant. Our server (Nice, young african american male. First name begin with a W?)  was very attentive and courteous. We ordered salmon for my son, buttered pasta with shrimp for babygirl and I got my fav bistro shrimp pasta. My son said the salmon was delicious! He usually order fish and chips, but he said this was almost better. For an extra $5, we added shrimp to my daughters kids pasta. There were 5 tiny shrimp on her plate. For $5 they should added 10 shrimp or at least 5 large shrimp! The bistro pasta was very tasty (as usual). Thin spaghetti in a creamy lemon sauce, shrimp, tomatoes, mushrooms and arugula. I always enjoy the bread and butter as well. Espcially the brown bread (it's either squaw or molasses bread).  For dessert we had the 30th year annivesary, s'mores and Craig's outrages cheesecakes.

LaVette A.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,12,2,1.0,10/21/2016,"This review is one I am having mixed emotions about writing. I like this location and haven't had any issue with it but today I was not happy and thought I should let it be known. Normally when I go here, and it's not terribly frequent, every thing is quite delightful. The waitstaff is usually cheerful, kind and helpful and food is always good. The food was good as usual but the service left much to be desired. Our waitress, Amber S., needs to find another line of work. Seriously. She hardly checked on us after we were served our food unless I flagged her down. She went sailing past our table numerous times without checking to see if we needed anything and I could hear her at other tables surrounding us asking if they needed this or that but we always had to catch her in mid-flight. After about the third flag down, I sensed a bit of an attutude so I decided it was time to go. We then went another stretch of her basically ignoring us unless we flagged her down. Once she brought the check, she waited until I had my attention diverted and she zips by and grabs the folder off of the table before I could address what needed to be done in regards to the bill because I was using a giftcard as partial payment of the check. Anyway, I'm not going to go on and on about this but as you can see this was frustrating as hell at best. I'm not sure if this job for her is a means to an end or if this will be a career choice for her. Whichever it is, this is a customer service oriented job with emphasis on CUSTOMER SERVICE. Her ""niceties"" were quite transparent and it was obvious she is not enjoying her job. And if that's the case then at this point all I can say to someone like this is to find your passion so you aren't low key salty all the time. Furthermore, sweeten up your attitude, treat people respectfully and in the meantime don't take your frustrations out on innocent customers who've done nothing but merely walk into your establishment and end up having the misfortune of being seated in your section.  ***The 1 star rating is for the waitress not a commentary on the Redondo Beach location as a whole.***",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=160
Jocelyn M.,"Los Angeles, CA",939,396,2734,4.0,9/17/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory is a lot better than other Cheesecake Factory's that I've been to. The best thing about this one is the location. It's right by the water in Redondo Beach. You can sit by the window and see the harbor or even outside too.  The wait was around 15 minutes when my boyfriend and I came for dinner on a Saturday night around 6PM. We asked for the first available seat and were seated outside. Our server took awhile to come greet us. We were started off with some bread. I think the bread is my favorite part of Cheesecake Factory....that wheat bread and sourdough bread..I can eat baskets after baskets. i should definitely stop though because I always get full before my meal even comes out yet! Oh well. No regrets. For appetizers we got the avocado eggrolls. Man, these were AMAZING!! The portion was huge and we were already full after just finishing these. I also ordered a cup of soup of the day which was baked potato soup. Bread dipped in soup = HEAVEN.  By the time our entrees came out, I was already super full. I ate maybe about only 1/4 of my pesto pasta. My boyfriend ordered the Mac and Cheese Burger. It was huge and he definitely had a hard time finishing it as well. But he pulled through and ate most of it. Good job boyfriend!!! Food was good. I think we ordered too much. Next time, we'll definitely order less...and I need to learn to control myself with the bread haha. A side-note, our server was a little bit...slow. He didn't seem to know the answers to a lot of questions that we asked. Plus, when I asked to substitute the chicken for shrimp in my pasta, he didn't give me a substitution price.

A party of 5, we were seated within 20 minutes, which was ok for a Monday night. The server was nice but appeared very inexperienced. The appetizers we ordered took FOREVER, like maybe 35 or 40 minutes. The nachos we're good but calamari was a waste of money, and both were overpriced. The dinners, when they finally arrived, were good but not great, with the exception of the Madera chicken. The cheesecake was nothing special, especially at what they charge. It would have been much nicer to have good service since we were celebrating a special occasion.

Lisa Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",815,400,1654,5.0,5/29/2014,"I always like coming to this Cheesecake Factory. The menu has a wide variety and a nice selection for anyone in your party.  The location is pretty--it's right by the ocean, and you can see all of the boats outside in the marina.  The overall atmosphere is nice, from the décor to the friendly staff. Also, the restaurant and bathrooms are kept pretty clean. Parking is not the best, but if you don't want to valet, it's not usually too difficult to find metered street parking across the street. Appetizers: Let me first start off by saying that I love crab cakes. I mean LOVE. Whenever I see them on a menu at any restaurant, I am immediately drawn towards them.  So over the years, I've had quite a few different ones. I can honestly say that Cheesecake Factory has THE best crab cakes I've ever had. They are my absolute favorite! I am a little disappointed, though, that lately they have become smaller and smaller...but other than that, they are amazing! These crab cakes contain a lot of crab!...not just filler like many other restaurants. Avocado Egg Rolls are also a must-try! The contrast between the avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, and tamarind-cashew dipping sauce, create wonderfully complex flavors of sweet, salty, and tangy. Entrée favorites: - Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - Lot of veggies, but delicious flavor! The sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts definitely make this dish! - Bistro Shrimp Pasta - I'm pretty sure I saw this on one of those lists of really unhealthy pasta dishes...but let me tell you, it is worth those calories! Crispy battered shrimp, fresh mushrooms, tomato, and arugula tossed with spaghettini and a basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce. Does that not sound amazing or what?! - Pan-Seared Salmon with Angel Hair - The lemon-caper sauce is really good! - Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Mushrooms, pancetta, and peas are great combination in any pasta! Dessert: I know we're talking about The Cheesecake Factory here, but truthfully, I'm not the biggest fan of cheesecake. GASP, I know. However, they do have a few non-cheesecake options, to which I am very pleased with. Linda's Fudge Cake is definitely the way to go if you want something sweet, rich, and chocolate-y! A slice of this 7-layered cake is HUGE, so make sure you bring someone to share it with!....or not...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=160

With me?? What was it?? Did I put it in? Yes. I put it in"" We got our drinks at the bar, two other people dropped off water and bread. So literally the one thing I ordered from her she had forgot..

Giovanna M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,12,,1.0,7/19/2017,"I don't know if management has changed but this Cheesecake Factory is going, no, actually it has gone down hill. Way down hill. It sucks now. My family and I all met at the Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach this past Sunday (7-16-17) for a get-together lunch. We've been going to this Cheesecake Factory for so many years so I always think that the last BAD visit was just a random, once in a while situation. Yes, you have to take ""some"" bad with the good. Well, I think that bad service and bad food can be considered the norm at this Cheesecake Factory now. I can honestly say, at least the last 6 visits have been awful. Both the service and the food is lacking any quality. No joke - This Cheesecake Factory really sucks now! ~The valet parking - the decorative trees at the entrance of the valet hang low so when I drove up in my F-150 truck, I tried to go as far in the middle as possible so not to let the trees rake the top of my truck. One of the packing attendants noticed and moved the little podium, which I thought was great. But then he made a comment in Spanish to the other 2 attendants, which I understood, then they all started laughing. ~ We were a party of 6 however, we were led to be seated right away. When we were given a table right between a busboy station and the exit door to the deck. I didn't say anything, I figured that every once in a while, you need to accept a crappy table. We waited 15 minutes for the waitress to approach our table, and waited an additional 25 minutes for waters and ice teas. We were given 1 batch of bread - 3 pcs for 6 people. We asked for more but never received any. The whole time we made the best of the day and stayed positive. The food arrived another 35 minutes after the drinks were served. And our ice teas were never once re-filled. We were all over the bad service and bad food so we didn't have any desert. We received the bill before our plates were even cleared away from the table. By the way, during the whole meal - there was this 1 waitress that kept throwing dishes into a bin in the busboy station. Literally throwing them. They made this incredibly load sound that startled me each and every time. It was funny at first. We all laughed at it, but then it got really annoying. *By the way - I found something in my salad that neither my sister or I could make heads or tails on what it could be. Then 1 random waitress that over heard us talking took it and returned to explain it was a piece of onion. I know what an onion looks like, raw as well as cooked, sauteed, boiled, fried, steamed, poached, caramelized, broiled, damn it, that wasn't a freaking piece of onion! Whatever, mental note - ""Don't think about that thing you found in your salad."" We then received the bill, of course before our plates were even cleared away from the table. We paid the bill and we walked out, all with the same disappointed feeling of a crappy Sunday get-together lunch. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=200

It took a full hour to be seated after being told it would be 30 minutes. It took an hour to receive the first three of seven plates for dinner.

There was a crowd of people standing at the door waiting for it to open and a man steps out and says ""just to let you know we have four more minutes until opening"", um okay not sure why you needed to do that but whatever. When it's finally 11:30 they open the doors and we wait to put our names down. The girl at the desk (I forgot to get a name) was extremely rude and just seemed irritated, which I could understand if it had been a long day but they literally just opened the doors, but again we left it alone. So we put our names down figuring that it shouldn't be too long of a wait since they just opened, wrong! Not only did they proceed to seat 2 people in front of us (that did not have reservations) but then they came and said ""oh we can't seat you except for the bar not enough servers sorry"". You're joking right? And you do realize parking is not free? I'm gonna assume they will say something along the lines of ""we are a big restaurant and we try to accommodate as best we can, blah blah blah"". Honestly, they could've handled that a little better.

Justin L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",253,41,353,3.0,8/17/2015,"This is actually my favorite CCF location because it is by the water. All you see are the boats in the harbor and not really the ocean, but nonetheless, it's still very nice.  Let's start out by saying that parking here sucks. It's valet only $4 plus tip. However, I believe on the weekdays, you have the option to self park in the very tiny lot on the right after you enter. Later on, I found out that the parking lot isn't owned by CCF so they had to pay the city money to use it and therefore, the fee passed down to the consumers. It still doesn't change my mind about how sucky the parking is, but at least I understand.  Next, please come early. The lines at this place is strangely outrageous. To be honest, CCF isn't even such a great restaurant, but this location is always packed and I don't understand. For dinner time, try aiming for 4-5 because you'll have to definitely wait any time after.    The menu has a lot of variety and can be overwhelming at times because of the many pages. Keep in mind, the portion size at this place is really big and I have never finished anything that I've gotten here. The give free bread!! Who doesn't love free bread!? My favorite is the wheat one, it's way better than the white one. As for entrees, I think the spaghetti and meatballs was pretty good as well as the parmesan chicken. My mom seem to really enjoy the meatloaf. For dessert, you HAVE to get a cheesecake. The cheesecake here is absolutely delicious. I've tried the red velvet, mango keylime, and strawberry. All three were really good!

T Z.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",2,9,4,1.0,9/6/2016,"OMG... We always go to this location with family and friends. However we decided to take my in laws on Labor Day and we got there around 12pm. I never experienced a horrible service in my life that we got yesterday. I was soooo ashamed front of my in laws. Our server was so unfriendly with a big attitude... Everything we asked for it took her a long time to bring. When we got there it wasn't busy yet so I'm surprised that it took 50 min to get 4 orders of California Omelette. And after 50 min when I asked the server why is taking such a long time to bring our food she said well you asked for cream cheese that usually on Mondays we don't have that much..um okay. She had our toast and before she puts it down with an attitude she said so should I take back ur toast or you want it? I mean really is this how they trained you here? When I asked for the manager all he had to say was sorry and our food should be ready soon. Two other tables got there after us and they ordered lunch menu they both got their foods and was ready to pay...I always go to this location, but after yesterday I will find a different place to go spend my money or take my family. Oh and I ordered my omelette with egg whites and asked for tomatoes, and when I got my food after 50 min my omelette was with regular egg and on the side with crispy potatoes. My husband asked just for a regular coffee it took her 15 min just to bring his creamer...I mean his coffee was cold already... I understand its busy but have some manner and treat your customers with some respect. Horrible service so unprofessional..still in shock of her attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=200
Dennis C.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,480,24,4.0,6/23/2015,Visited on a busy Saturday night. We asked for outside seating and were attended to in under 30 minutes. We were given a good spot overlooking the marina and it was just what I was expecting!  Entrees came out quick and servers were everywhere willing to get you what you needed. I had the bacon-bacon burger and while it may not have been the best burger I have had. I enjoyed all the food and all the service we received. I like this particular location due to its overlooking the ocean. $4 for valet parking. Not a huge line for cheesecake either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=200

C R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,139,51,1.0,12/30/2016,"On December 29th, 2016, at approximately 9:20pm, my friend and I visited this restaurant for dinner, like we have countless times before. We were promptly seated in a booth, and we were told that Antoinette would be our waitress. She had never before been our waitress. She took much longer than usual to take our orders, and then we waited for our food. As we waited for nearly an hour, Antoinette must have passed our table nearly 10 times without saying a word. After we sat down, an African American family sat behind us and Antoinette stopped at their table 4 or more times, and they received their food before we did. By the time we began eating, the African American family had already left, and I made an effort to check by looking behind me. I watched Antoinette, and she was waiting on 4 different tables near us, but never once stopped to ask us if we needed water, NOR did she tell us ""your food will be out shortly, sorry for the wait, etc."" She also was not knowledgeable, and wanted to charge me extra for a turkey burger patty. She told me that if I wanted the turkey burger patty wrapped in lettuce, that it would be considered protein style, and that it would be an additional charge. However, in previous times there was no additional charge, and with barbeque sauce.  I told my friend that I was going to wait till 10:25pm, more than an hour after we arrived at the Cheesecake Factory, to inquire about the whereabouts of our food. At 10:25pm, I walked up to the hostess and told her that we had been here for more than an hour, and we did not have our food yet. I then saw our ""waitress"" Antoinette, and asked her ""where is our food, it's been an hour"" and she rudely said ""I DON'T MAKE THE FOOD, WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK INTO THE KITCHEN AND ASK WHERE YOUR FOOD IS."" I was shocked and speechless, and then I told her ""isn't that your job?"" and she rudely responded ""YOU DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY."" I told her that I had the right to ask where my food was and she stormed off and once again said ""YOU DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.""  It became crystal clear that my friend and I were being directly targeted, and this was a clear case of discrimination. I spoke to the manager, Aurelia, who was polite and professional, and she immediately brought out our food. It turns out that our food was just sitting on the counter, and ANTOINETTE WAS AWARE OF THIS, BUT SHE PURPOSELY DID NOT WANT TO BRING OUR FOOD OUT. Antoinette never apologized, she just walked by and gave me nasty looks. I will remind all of you that Antoinette is an employee of The Cheesecake Factory, and represents the company, and according to Respondent Superior, a company is liable for the wrongful actions of their employees. Antoinette failed to conduct herself according to the code of conduct of Cheesecake Factory, and failed to perform her duties, and went as far as telling me to perform her duties for her, when she told me to ""go back into the kitchen and ask where my food was."" In addition, she used insulting language when she raised her voice and told me that ""she doesn't cook the food.""  I will NEVER allow Antoinette's uncivilized, and hostile conduct to go unnoticed. While employees sometimes make mistakes, this was a CLEAR CASE of malicious, hateful, and purposeful conduct that Antoinette carried out with the specific intent of ruining our dinner experience; therefore. I am 100% convinced that Antoinette was completely aware of the fact that our food was ready, and was purposely neglecting us, and she was just waiting for me to inquire about my food so she could lash out.  I emailed the district manager, Mr. DeMoro, on Dec. 29th, and he never responded. I had to call him, and he said ""Oh I forgot."" I called again, and he told me that Antoinette offered NO explanation as to why she acted the way she did, and that disciplinary action had been taken against her. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) grade for this place is a ""D-"", I'm not surprised. They never responded to my BBB complaint. How unprofessional. The CEO of Cheesecake Factory (Mr. Overton) dropped out of his sole graduate degree (UC Hastings Law School). When I called corporate, some Irish woman spoke to me on his behalf, and told me that I ""chose to stay"" and finish dinner after the incident with Antoinette, as if I was partially to blame, when I absolutely wasn't. I felt that she was speaking WAY above her level, but this is typical of undereducated people. UPDATE: they cut the size of their black out cake by a 3rd, and they are charging the same price, $8.50 for a tiny piece of cake. Disgraceful! I won't be returning to this loud, unprofessional, and dismissive establishment EVER AGAIN. I can get better service and ambiance elsewhere, and BETTER & CHEAPER DESSERTS. Lastly, the coffee here is DISGUSTINGLY watery. Cheesecake Factory is currently being sued for an issue with their bill split tips. I hope this company goes bankrupt in my lifetime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=200
Niles C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,68,,2.0,1/1/2016,"The food is good, but this restaurant's heyday is in the past. I have been coming here with my family since the first Bush was president, on a regular basis I might add. I doubt there are that many people who have dined at this restaurant more than we have. 1) The food is still good, but the portions are not nearly as large as they were 10 years ago. In fact, in the 90s, the portions were borderline comically large. This is not the case anymore. 2) Customer service has DIMINISHED. The new waitstaff is NOT well trained. I can excuse inexperience, but stupidity and arrogance I will not.         a) Months ago, the waitress abandoned us for 20 minutes. We got the manager who                      explained she switched serving areas and forgot to tell the new waitress. No compensation or even apologies from the manager. Wow!        b) Another time, we ordered a salad as an appetizer. The waitress brought it during our dinner. We reminded her that we wanted it as an appetizer. She blamed the kitchen staff, said it wasn't her fault, and offered no apologies. Young lady, seriously?!?! And you think this is going to win you a generous tip. Last point, Cheescake factory, I understand this isn't FINE dining, but for the love of god, can you please instruct your waiters to bring NEW glasses for refills on soft drinks. It's tacky and inelegant to have to hand your drinks to the waiter...which brings me to anther gripe. Instruct your waitstaff to place the plates and drinks on the table INSTEAD of handing them to the patrons.

They apologized and said their kitchen was busy.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon.  Then they told us that they will make us a fresh food.  When my food arrived, it was the same food!!!! They tried to hide it by moving the part I had eaten under and putting fresh cheese on top!  The noodles were warmer but looks they just added more sauce to warm it up.  Don't trust your food this Cheesecake Factory.  The manager walked away looking embarrassed when I showed her where they tried to pretend I got a new freshly cooked food.

The Cajun jambalaya has shrimp and chicken with green and red peppers, red onions and bits of tomato tossed in linguini. I always ask for extra spice and it is like an explosion of flavor.

Appetizer came out with entree which also had sauce after requesting no sauce. Kids meal wasn't cooked all the way. I didn't even touch my entree, it was obvious and she said can I take this away. Never asked if anything was wrong. We used to eat here at least 2 times a month and the service and food were amazing. It has gone down hill quickly.

Jenni M.,"Downey, CA",425,684,2351,4.0,10/10/2013,"My hubby & I didn't request to sit near a great view, but we got one anyway. We were seated outside under an umbrella. I wish the umbrellas casted more shade, but my husband wasn't bothered too much by his arm getting burned. The views of the marina were nice. I had only two complaints about this place... 1). Valet parking is $4. My hubby didn't want to use their services so he asked to park our car himself. It just doesn't seem like a valet restaurant. Very unnecessary. Maybe next time we'll use the meters on the street.  2). Sparrows & other small birds kept flying in for scraps.  When we had lunch here, it was a Monday at around 11:30. It was moderately busy while we were there, then when we left at around 12:30, a few groups were waiting to be seated.  The restrooms were clean. They are located at the front to the left of the desserts, fyi.  I had the turkey sandwich with a side salad from the lunch menu. The portions are generous. To drink, I had the ""Frozen Iced Mango."" It was so delicious. It even came with a slice of pineapple which I don't care for, but I even nibbled on it a little. I just wish they had blended it a little more. It was a little on the chunky side.  Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. She tried fairly hard to get us to order some dessert, but I had to decline. I don't have a yearning for sweets after every meal is all.  While I am not Cheesecake Factory crazy like some people I know, this location is a fantastic one.

Chinadoll B.,"El Segundo, CA",19,84,10,1.0,1/16/2017,Jan 15th was my sisters birthday so my mother bought her a gift card for $100 to her favorite restaurant which is the CHEESECAKE FACTORY. She ordered her favorite meal TO GO...The SHRIMP SCAMPI. She also ordered me the CAJUN JAMBALAYA. Along with two appetizers and two pieces of cheesecake which cane up to $85 and some change. I don't know if there was a different cook on duty or what but her shrimp scampi was dry with barely any sauce and the Shrimp was over cooked. Also there was about 2 shrimp in the Cajun Jambalaya!!! No exaggeration. The appetizers were great and also our cheesecakes but the main dishes were not acceptable. NOT TO MENTION NO BREAD IN THE BAG????? We're regulars there. At least every other sunday. This Cheesecake factory is our go to spot because the food is always good and we live close by. We never had this issue until of course we had our order to go. I will be calling corporate to complain but wanted to say if you eat there often as we do then you know exactly how their food should taste. Which is always good and made perfectly but This time this wasn't the case.

Jenn G.,"Torrance, CA",1680,1066,6642,5.0,5/12/2013,"A sweet lunch @Cheesecake Factory for the sweetest mom ever :). Happy Mother's Day! I took my mom out to lunch at The Cheesecake Factory today for a Mother's Day lunch. I love this Cheesecake Factory location because it has a great view of the Redondo Beach harbor! It's so lovely to be enjoying lunch with my lovely mom enjoying a lovely view. The blue skies, sunny day and pretty boats made for a great view. We started off lunch here with some warm complimentary bread! They bring out two types of bread, sourdough and squaw bread. I like the squaw bread the best. It has a slight taste of sweet.  My mom and I chose to get the portabella mushroom, avocado and zucchini fries from the small plates menu. I like the small plates menu because they are small sides that are like appetizers at a cheaper price. These fries we got were only $6.95. It was a such a great deal! Three types of yummy breaded and fried veggies that were served piping hot along with two types of yummy dipping sauce. The menu of Cheesecake Factory is huge! I am fond that there are several vegetarian items and a skinnylicious menu with healthier entrees that are still yummy but less calories.  One of the nicest vegetarian entrees I have gotten is the garlic noodles. It has asparagus, shiitake mushrooms and oven roasted tomatoes on top of spaghettini noodles with garlic sauce. My mom's favorite is shrimp with linguine. It's a great looking dish with long thin noodles topped with large succulent shrimp!   For this Mother's Day lunch, my mom and I ordered two classic favorites. My mom got the most popular chicken dish, chicken madeira! It is no wonder this is so popular because it is delicious. There are two large chicken breasts topped with asparagus, mushroom madeira sauce and mozzarella cheese! It comes with two large scoops of mashed potatoes too! It's one large and tasty meal.  I chose to get the lunch portion meatloaf! I was so surprised at how big the lunch portion is! It comes with two large meat patties that were topped with thick gravy and grilled onions. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and corn succatosh. The meatloaf and mashed poatoes were so soft. They pratically melted in my mouth! The succotash had a such a great flavor to it. My review would not be complete without mentioning the cheesecake here! It's one of the hardest decisions on which cheesecake flavor to get. There are so many!  My mom and I tried the Oreo dream extreme. I loved how it was topped with an Oreo cookie! It's more chocolate flavored versus Oreo though, thus making it very chocolatey bold and rich in taste. Our favorite cheesecake is the red velvet! It is just the right amount of sweet. The layers of red velvet cake is nice and moist!  The Cheesecake Factory is a wonderful place for bonding with my mom. It has a nice view and good eats! My mom deserves no less than the best and I am thankful this place offers the best variety. Every item we have tried here is scrumptious and awesome!

Eriko P.,"Santa Monica, CA",188,426,2604,5.0,5/10/2015,"I came here on  Sunday, May 2, 2015 around 11:30am. It was already packed! Beware, there is road construction on Harbor Drive, and the entrance to the Cheesecake Factory can be missed. Upon arrival, I found out the only choice was to Valet park... ugh... $4. not including tip. I was not happy about this, but I didn't have a choice. I didn't see any street parking available, due to the heavy road construction, so I reluctantly gave my keys to the valet. This was the only negative aspect, and I later learned this parking lot is a city lot and The Cheesecake Factory must pay the city for the use of this lot.  As soon as I arrived, the receptionist greeted us with a smile and asked if we wanted to be seated inside or outside. We opted for a quiet area, inside. The overall restaurant is noisy. We were seated promptly and Michelle, our server greeted us an truly took care of us during our lunch.  The menu is extensive, and I haven't been to a Cheescake Factory in years, so it took we a few minutes to decide. We both decided on the LUNCH menu, which is the best bang for the buck! The bread basket arrived shortly after we ordered. Warm piping bread.I restrained myself from eating more than one piece because I wanted to save room for my salad and later cheesecake.  We started with the avocado eggrolls! OH MY! I could of had this for a meal. It comes with 6 pieces, and splitting it between us was easy, but I could not imagine eating more afterwards, but I did. These rolls have a crunch, the creamy avocado with the sundried tomato and the chimmichuri dipping sauce is incredibly tasty!    My lunch size Luau salad was large, tall, stacked architecturally, and beautiful. I admired it for a few minutes, before breaking it down. Every bite was superb. My friend ordered the Chicken Piccata, which looked heavenly! My friend told me her chicken piccata was ""melt in your mouth"" delicious. My salad was so delicious, I can still taste the different textures, ingredients which make this combination a perfect salad.  We both enjoyed our lunch, but saved room for a cheesecake dessert! We split the lemon raspberry cheesecake. The crust is made from ladyfingers. Overall, this is a light cheesecake, not heavy and rich. We both loved it. It was a perfect ending to a great lunch.  Thank you Michelle for serving us with a smile and taking good care of us.

There is no parking validation if you eat there. The lunch portions are not that much of a discount and the portions are a lot smaller. I would recommend just getting the dinner portions for the extra few dollars. Food was not warm and cheesecake is over priced.

Carolyn C.,"Torrance, CA",394,116,1434,1.0,7/18/2014,"It's crazy how one bad experience can ruin how you look at a restaurant from then on.  I've frequented different locations and had good experiences, but this would be my first time here at redondo beach. We chose to have dinner here for my birthday.  Business was busy as usual and luckily we were seated right away. We were facing the marina but it was already too dark anyway to enjoy the view. This was on a Tuesday evening. Ordered our drinks and appetizer and those arrived in a timely manner. However my strawberry lemonade was super sweet so I asked for a glass of water to dilute it. Our food arrived and everything was going well until my water finally arrived.  Our waiter, Dan reached over my daughter to hand me my water just as he bumped into another waiter and SPILLED HOT COFFEE ON MY DAUGHTERS BARE BACK! Common sense would be to deliver the hot beverage first, right? Now I know accidents happen but this could have been prevented. He then delivered the coffee anyway to the patron who ordered it! He did offer us some towels, which I asked him to make cold. He wasn't apologetic at all and became absent after he spilled the coffee. This would've lessened the hurt and embarrassment we had to endure because of his negligence. The manager, Jennifer was the most apologetic and helpful of the night as she called paramedics to check my daughter out. What a fiasco huh?!  Before this incident happened, he delivered a coke refill to our table but pretty much ran over with it, slammed it down and rushed to the next table to retrieve an appetizer plate that had been wrongly delivered. They were already digging in when Dan removed it and said ""this isn't yours, this is for another table."" He ran off with that as well, unknown if he delivered it to the correct table. I found out on this night that he was a new hire.  The food we ordered was good, however the circumstance we endured. We had shrimp and angel hair pasta: 3 stars. Crispy chicken costoletta: 5 stars. Steak Diane and chicken Madeira: 3 stars because there was a huge uncooked potato in my mashed potatoes. Lol. And my little one enjoyed her bow tie parmasean and butter pasta.  Our meal was cut short, we didn't even get to enjoy cheesecake. No birthday cheesecake for me!!!  ;(   This is the nearest Cheesecake Factory we live by and will probably only order cheesecake to go.

I believe it was partly because our server was relatively inexperienced. Nice kid... I mean really nice, but obviously he was new and the bad part of it was, the Cheesecake Factory management team either didn't recognize it or they just didn't seem to want to provide him any support. Even though there were many other employees in the area, serving other customers. Seriously, it felt like we were part of a ""stress test"" in a Bar Rescue episode!!! One of the dinner orders was incorrect, (maybe it was the noise in the area), which resulted in my daughter waiting an additional 30 minutes for her meal, (can you say COMP?), and our dessert order was incorrect as well. Bottom line... got there at 7:00ish and didn't get to pay our check until ~9:35... That was a couple drinks, an appetizer, 4 small meals and a desert order. Nearly 3 hours!!!

Prior to this visit, it has been a no-brainier, Cheesecake Factory pleases where ever you go.  Unfortunately, this location must be under new management, or the Waiting and Cook Staff needs a New Supervisor, because this place has let go of their usual high standards! Whatever the problem is, there is NEVER ANY REASON TO BE RUSHED TO ORDER AS SOON AS ONE SITS DOWN?? THEN AFTER BEING SNUBBED FOR 20 minutes , FOR NOT BEING READY? THEN  HAVE EVERYTHING DUMPED AT THE TABLE.... WATER, DRINKS, BREAD, APPETIZERS AND MAIN COURSE AT THE SAME TIME..! With an attitude as to asking them why?? Why this was happening??? What a JOKE..! We are not prudes here, nor do we expect special treatment. Just your low-key Redondo Beach Locales. We Just want the norm, a possible smile, Time to Look at the TWENTY PAGE MENU....YES!? And a reasonable relaxed environment to enjoy ourselves, and leisurely eat some good food. We were so embarrassed to think this place would impress some special guests. Of course they judge this as the Norm for an American Experience.....just OMG! Being possibly they had been busy, short handed, or training was going on might have been the case the last two visits. Sorry, not being nasty here, as it seemed none of the above was the case. It was not that busy, and quite a few empty tables with waiting staff manager wandering around texting and ignoring the whole affair. Unfortunately, this time and the time before, in 2016, The food was simply awful, like Entree Salads, how hard is it? Lacking an dressing, spoiled tomatoes? The other, Shepard's Pie, just is AWFUL now...! Before this visit, the other disaster,  it was a simple chicken dish and pizza, was a joke...just slop....what the hell? What is going on? What ever is the problem, Management, the waiting staff, and food prep, servers all are either pathetically undertrained, or just do not care. Simply put, just rude, impatient young folk, that do not care, that reflects a WE DON""T CARE IMAGE for the whole restaurant.

There was a good amount of people waiting outside, but the wait was only 15 minutes, so they were quickly seating people.  The location is very nice (sitting on the ocean), but the free parking is very limited, so bring some quarters for the meters across the street.  Our waitress was friendly and although very busy, she was attentive and helpful.  The appetizer/complimentary bread is very good. I really like the brown with the oats. The texture is so soft and chewy, with a slight sweetness. Tasted fresh and was perfectly warm when they brought it out.  The menu is huge and many items aren't the greatest for you, so I definitely appreciate all the Skinnylicious items they offer.  I decided to get the skinny lemon garlic shrimp, which is served with angel hair pasta and asparagus. I got the sauce on the side and only added a part of it to my dish. It was very flavorful and the shrimp was cooked nicely. I would definitely get that again. A bit expensive for the amount, but it was quality.  My whole family really enjoyed their meals as well. My mom said the skinny turkey and avocado sandwich was really good and was surprised that it was under 590 calories.  For dessert we ordered the Kalua and the Craig's carrot cheesecake. Both were delicious! A definite cheat day, but we enjoyed every bite of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=260

Kyung E.,"Gardena, CA",354,290,923,4.0,9/23/2013,"Came on a BUSY Saturday evening. We were asked if we wanted wait for an outside/inside table, or if we wanted to just take first available. We opted to just take whatever, because we were in a hurry. Plus, the weather was nice, if we were inside or outside, it really would not matter. We waited maybe five or ten minutes, and were seated in a nice booth towards the back of the restaurant. It was really busy, so I was surprised we got seated so quickly. The service was super fast and friendly. My bf was wearing a chive shirt, and one of the managers came over and said ""chive on!"" and said dessert was on her. Cool random act of kindness... I got my faves. Louisiana Chicken pasta and tex mex egg rolls. I have tried many dishes at cheesecake, but these two, I always go back to.  The pasta is bow tie, in a light, yet flavorful, slightly spicy Cajun style sauce. It is topped with 4 thin chicken cutlets that have been breaded with panko and expertly fried. This dish never lets me down.  Tex mex egg rolls are a delish combo of chicken, corn, black beans, rolled into a wonton wrapper, then fried, and served with a creamy avocado sauce! My bf LOVED the sauce. It is kind of addicting, and I've often wondered how they make it. Must google that after I finish this review.  BF ordered the Kobe burger. By the time we had our drinks and appetizers, he was pretty full, but the burger isn't too over the top. He was able to finish everything (except for the fries) and I boxed most of mine to-go. I think it was a perfect meal before our big Saturday night. I will definitely be coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=260

Wayne Y.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,33,1,2.0,11/29/2016,"My family went to this Cheesecake Factory to have a birthday lunch for my son this past weekend. First the positives: We went at around 2pm and there was no wait for our party of five. The server came promptly and took our drink orders. Now the negatives: there is no self-park option. Vaiet parking costs $4 and there is no choice but to use it even if there are ample spaces available. The server took our appetizer orders which took a very long time to come out. The bread basket provided us was not full (it was short a few pieces), maybe the server thought that since we were ordering appetizers, we didn't want as much bread? That should still be our choice, right? Finally, the food came but I have to say, the quality of the food did not seem as good as it once was. It all looked and tasted like the food was micro-waved and not freshly prepared. For example, the buffalo wings were soggy and tasted like those you purchase in bags at the supermarket. My son's angel hair pasta was overcooked and my daughter's and my entrees were overladen with mashed potatoes with the meat portion seemingly undersized. The price point of the menu should translate to better quality. The server did not come back to our table for a long time to check if everything was ok and whether we needed refills for beverages.  Cheesecake Factory used to be known for good quality food and large portions for sharing which justified the higher prices but recently, the focus seems to be more on the ""Factory"" part of the name - emphasis more on getting large parties in and out as fast as they can. Finally, on the bill, restaurants now often calculate the tip for you so you don't have to so the math. And it would be useful but this Cheesecake Factory starts its suggested tip at 22 percent! and scales up to 25%! Is this to catch unsuspecting foreign tourists who do not know what the usual tipping practices in this country are? I found this somewhat disingenuous. All in all, this Cheesecake Factory experience indicated to me that it is a place for a group to be able to gather and enjoy each others' company if food quality and service are not the highest priorities.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=260

Ben D.,"Southgate, MI",28,94,29,5.0,11/23/2014,This is a place that I try to visit when here in Hermosa Beach. I love the menu especially the cheesecakes. There is such s variety of foods and the view is awesome.  Just make sure you save room for the portion of food you consume. The portion sizes are probably for two. They also offer lunch portions on most if not all of their foods.  I always love the Chicken Romano (lunch portion of course). I also get the beef sliders and Mac and cheese balls. My favorite cheesecake is the Tuxedo cheesecake.

Jessica F.,"Carson, CA",66,28,24,4.0,8/10/2016,First off let me say that Natalie is awesome! Such a sweetheart :) she has a fantastic attitude and a smile to match. She was very helpful guiding me towards ordering a cocktail and she gave her honest opinion on the house cocktails which I really appreciated. She was prompt in greeting myself and my guest (we arrived separately) and she took our entree orders in a timely fashion. The bread service took a bit of time to come out but I'm guessing that's because they had just reached their peak hour of guests arriving. Our food was great (grilled fish tacos and smokehouse burger) and she was kind enough to ask us if we wanted our desserts for here or to go. We actually did want them to go so I was happy I didn't have to ask for that. I tried the 30th anniversary cheesecake and while it was okay it kind of paled in comparison to some of their other dessert selections. Other than that overall it was a great experience! One suggestion that I would make is for you guys to either install your own atm because your valet only accepts cash or to have some kind of system that accepts credit or debit cards outside. Especially when 95 percent of your parking lot is for valet. Also keep Natalie happy because she is awesome :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=260

The wait to get a table at one point was an hour and a half. However I am disappointed with the quality and the standard that the cheesecake factory has evolved into.

This review has everything to do with the unfair, ridiculous, asinine parking accommodations for the public.

How embarrassing is it that there are only 20 FREE parking stalls for the hundreds and hundreds of public diners to the restaurant, yet over 200+ VALET parking stalls in the lot as well? To force your customers to Valet park just to dine at your restaurant is utterly ridiculous. We're already coming to spend money on the food, at a minimum you can provide free parking to the thousands of customers you see weekly.

Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,5.0,2/25/2014,"I've been to many different locations for The Cheesecake Factory, but I would say this is one of my favorites. The ocean/waterfront provides the perfect backdrop for dining (definitely recommend coming here if you are planning a romantic meal for that special someone). The first time I came to this location, it was for an anniversary dinner on a weeknight and it was pretty late - around 9 p.m. But that ended up being extremely beneficial, as there were hardly any customers and our server was most attentive. One of the reasons why The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants is due to its extensive menu. There is truly something for everyone on there (picky eaters and those who love exotic cuisine). And did I mention the selection when it comes to cheesecakes/desserts? For first-timers, here's what I would recommend (based on my love for cheese and easy-to-please palate): Fried Macaroni and Cheese (appetizer): This gooey, cheesy mac and cheese mixture gets even better when deep fried and covered with a thin, crispy crumb layer. Cheese simply oozes out of the shell with every bite (truly a must for cheese lovers). The four mac and cheese balls are served with a creamy marinara sauce (not a very strong tomatoey taste) and bits of shredded cheese on top. Macaroni and Cheese Burger (glamburger): This burger definitely falls under the ""gourmet"" category. It's unique because it includes a slightly flattened deep-fried mac and cheese ball (like the ones featured in the appetizer mentioned above) atop a charbroiled patty, Cheddar cheese sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickles, an onion and mayo. I would recommend only eating half of this savory burger if you plan to save room for dessert. Grilled Cheese Sandwich (sandwich): This used to be a staple on the very bottom of the ""Glamburgers and Sandwiches"" portion of the menu, but the eatery has since taken it off ever since the menu was revised. I was told, however, that I could still order this delicious grilled cheese upon request. The dish features the customer's choice of cheese sandwiched between two pieces of egg-battered bread and is served with French Fries that are generously salted and tasty. Chicken Madeira (specialties): This chicken dish is famous as the eatery's ""most popular chicken dish."" Flavorful and savory, this one is definitely a winner. The dish contains a couple pieces of tender, sautéed chicken breast topped generously with melted Mozzarella cheese and pieces of asparagus. It's also covered with flavorful mushroom Madeira sauce and is served with fluffy mashed potatoes. Again, if you're a cheese lover, you'll want to indulge in this savory dish. Chicken Piccata (specialties): The flavor from the capers combined with the strands of Angel Hair pasta are probably the crowning glories of this dish. It features sautéed chicken breast topped with lemon sauce, mushrooms and capers. I would recommend asking for extra cheese for additional flavor/savoriness. Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple (cheesecake): Be forewarned - this is probably one of the sweetest cheesecakes on the menu, but it's definitely one of my favorites. This decadent dessert features the original cheesecake in an Oreo Cookie crust and includes caramel, chunks of Butterfingers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and peanut butter throughout. Peanut butter lovers will especially appreciate the fresh dollop of peanut butter mousse that comes atop the cheesecake.  Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake (cheesecake): Even though this sounds overwhelmingly sweet, ironically, this cheesecake isn't as sweet as its close cousin, the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, because it contains layers of moist chocolate fudge cake in between the layers of cheesecake (versus layers of pure cheesecake). The layers of moist chocolate cake offset and complement the layers of cheesecake in a nice way, and peanut butter lovers will rejoice upon eating the dollop of peanut butter mousse atop the dessert. There are generous chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (my favorite candy) loaded in the cheesecake layers, and there are also thin layers of caramel. Finally, the crust is an absolute wonder, as it's covered with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups as well.  Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake (specialty cheesecake): Currently, the regular ""Oreo"" cheesecake has been replaced with the ""Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake"" on the dessert menu. I personally prefer the regular ""Oreo"" cheesecake because it does not contain the layer of Oreo Cookie mousse (whereas the ""Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake"" does). However, both cheesecakes have winning qualities, including generous chunks of Oreos baked into the layers of cheesecake, a sweet milk chocolate icing and a decadent Oreo Cookie crust.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=300
Tyler T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",23,19,,5.0,11/29/2016,"Last night, I had the pleasure of visiting one of my favorite chain restaurants. The Cheesecake Factory has always been a favorite of mine. The one in Redondo Beach, I particularly enjoy, because it sits right next to the docked boats & after a meal it's nice to walk along the docks, look at the fish & boats, and make your way to the Portofino Inn & watch the seals. Last night, as I was saying, I decided to indulge my carbo cravings by choosing the Four Cheese Pasta, and I'm glad I did. The Penne pasta was cooked perfectly, the Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano, and Parmesan cheese blended in perfectly with their light Marinara sauce & fresh basil. The menu offers an option for chicken, but I strayed a bit and asked if they would include an Italian sausage to the dish instead. It was wonderful. The bread was soft & piping hot so the butter melted on contact & our server was delightful! I ordered a cucumber lemonade, which I recommend, but I asked for them to water it down. Finally, to quench my sweet tooth, I went with Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake which definitely, did not disappoint. This deliciously designed masterpiece, is a multilayered, creamy chocolate chip coconut cheesecake with chocolate cake, chewy brownie, and a coconut pecan frosting, This place never disappoints!

Appetizers: - Tex Mex Eggrolls (Southwestern style eggrolls with avocado.

In recent years they've added a small plates menu and a healthy options menu, which is great because they are generally known for giant shareable portions, which unfortunately come with a big calorie load for those of us lacking self control ;)   I love the ahi tuna tartar and the pear gorgonzola flatbread, so good, and good size portions for like $6, both under 500 calories, love it. The cheesecake is also phenomnal and comes in about 40 different varities if you're feeling indulgent.  My personal favorite is the carmel turtle, so freaking good. Also a couple often overlooked non-cheescake deserts there worthy of trying out are the lemoncello torte and the warm apple crips a la mode, both excellent.

Susan M.,"Corona, CA",127,294,96,4.0,6/9/2015,"A beautiful view of the harbor, convenient valet parking and yummy food make this a winning restaurant. I love their Chicken Piccata....the best I have found anywhere. The sauce is the perfect blend of lemon and butter, and the chicken is incredibly tender. It is served over angel hair pasta. I ask for it without mushrooms and they happily accommodate.  For dessert, cheesecake is a must. This most recent time I ordered the Oreo which was sinfully good. I also like the white chocolate raspberry.  So given that I liked everything, you may be asking why the 4 stars? The reason has to do with being a parent. My daughter is 2 years old and this restaurant had no coloring or crayons. It is quite unusual for a restaurant to not offer anything to keep the little ones busy. Thankfully, I had some crayons and a coloring book in my car.

We literally just left and I thought I could brush it off but her attitude was just so unnecessary.  I came here with my mom and her two friends for a quick celebration lunch for me graduating and passing my licensing test to become a nail tech. My moms english is not bad at all but her two friends cant speak/understand as well so i ordered for them. It didn't seem to slow her down, i felt like actually it was helping her since their english would be difficult to understand. But the whole time she acted annoyed with our table. I let it go but it was when we were leaving.  We asked for boxes since we had a lot of food leftover and she asked for our plates. When she grabbed them she asked one of my moms friend to ""leave the fork"" and her friend thought she meant on the table so she did. And the server said ""no leave the fork i need it to put the food in the boxes"" but like i said her english isn't the best so i was like oh okay and proceeded to grab the fork for her but instead she looked at us rolled her eyes and walked away saying ""no its fine ill just grab another one"" i was like wtf?? But when she came back she gave us ONE BAG so my moms friend said ""oh separate please"" and the server replied with ""YEAH i know I'm going to bring some after"" in the rudest tone!

First thing you'll notice: huuuge parking lot BUT valet only! why?!? $4 valet too.... FOOD: This time around I ordered the jambalaya pasta while my gf ordered the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce. The jambalaya had great flavor: spicy with a bit of sweetness from the onions and bell peppers. However the noodles and shrimp were way over-cooked. Noodles were mushy and past the point of al dente. Shrimp when cooked right has a snap when you bite into it. These had a slightly mushy exterior. Also, the whole dish felt overly oily, but I think that is with all pasta at Cheesecake. 2/5 The chicken with scampi sauce is better: the noodles are cooked al dente and the dish didn't feel as heavy as the jambalaya. 4/5 Overall: 3/5 SERVICE: Our food came in a timely manner and everything went smoothly. Our waitress was nice and checked up on us every so often. Overall: 4/5 DECOR/AMBIANCE: The restaurant overlooks the bay and is very beautiful during the day, but you won't see much at night. Dimly lit restaurant that has a casual feel even though I know Cheesecake tries to make it very upscale.  Overall: 4/5 Their pasta can be hit or miss. As with my Jambalaya tonight, it was a miss, but my gf's dish was good. I really don't get why they require valet service for a place that has such a large parking lot. Their cheesecakes are great, but only if you have room for it afterwards. Their portions are pretty large.  PRO-TIP: if you get the pasta, get the sauce on the side so that you can mix in your own amounts to prevent the overly oily and heavy feeling of the sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=340

I asked if it would be like the slice I had ordered last month from the Grove location with the Raspberry Sauce and whipped cream and was told yes that is how I would receive it. Fast forward to picking it up. I waited over 20 minutes as it sat on the counter in the box for someone to place it in a bag and let me know it was ready. I had her open it up to make sure it was the right on. I asked about the Raspberry Sauce and was told it would be an additional $1.50, Fine but where were the rosettes of whipped cream? I was told we can't do that. Come on, this is for a Holiday dinner party and it does not even look like what I had previously ordered.

Alvin R.,"Carson, CA",115,46,17,2.0,8/24/2015,"I've been to this location in the past, and although The Cheesecake Factory isn't my favorite restaurant, I do enjoy some of their menu items. The food during our visit yesterday was no different, so my review is based on customer service. I took my parents to this location yesterday for lunch and received lack of customer service. I can't say it was bad or terrible, but a lack of service because we felt our server was hardly around or took a long time. It took a while until we first saw our server, so I figured we order everything all at once - drinks, appetizers, and main dishes. While waiting, I noticed it was taking a while before we got our waters. In fact, my dad's cocktail was brought sooner by another server than our waters from our actual server. Anyone notice something odd about that, but me? I don't know how long it takes to make cocktails, but I'm pretty sure it would take much longer to make cocktail drinks than pour a glass of water. Also, it's probably a lesser complaint than what I'm about to share, but when our bread was brought out, I noticed our server had another table's check booklet on top of our bread. You don't know who's hands or dirty tables these booklet carrying checks have touched. So, to see that on top of our bread was a little rude, I thought. After our meal, I asked for the check and boxes for our leftovers. Again, it took a while for our server to deliver these items. She first comes by for our boxes, but doesn't have our check. When finally she hands me our check on her second trip to our table, she was nowhere to be found for me to pay for our meals. At this point, I pretty much had it because I was in a hurry. So, I went to the front counter expecting to pay there. To my disbelief, I was told by 3 ladies near the front counter working the dessert bar that I would have to go back to our table to pay. WTF? Not until I asked a gentleman behind the counter if he was the manager did I find out that it was absolutely fine to pay at the front counter. At that point, I pretty much lost it. I'm not one to be vocal and start a scene with my complaints, but the fact 3 ladies at the front counter, including one who takes down the number of guests at the front, did not have a clue what to do totally blew my mind. Either they did not have any idea how to resolve a problem or they did not want to deal with it. I'm really upset how the situation was handled. I had to wait until I asked the gentleman behind the register, if he was the manager in order for me to pay at the front counter. I've never worked as a server, but if you can't ring a customer at the front counter because it's the duty of the table server, I'm sure there's a manager who can override and get it done. Why did no one do that in the first place? Because I was able to get it done... and I don't even work there. The food is delicious, but the customer service here during our visit yesterday was nonexistent. The ladies who work here rubbed me off the wrong way and gave me the impression they had no clue how to resolve an issue. A COMPLETE DISREGARD for customer satisfaction. I honestly received fast and satisfactory treatment from their valet.

Jay W.,"Riverside, CA",159,82,50,2.0,8/30/2015,"This is hands down the worst experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake factory by an extreme margin. Our party of 6 are all fans of the chain, and we were simply shocked at how poor the service was with our waitress (mid-late 30s blond with really short hair). We were there on the 28th, seated on the patio at around 9:30 pm. This is the nicest Cheesecake Factory I've seen to date, which made the service even more disappointing. To preface my issues ... I realize restaurants are strangers serving other strangers. We don't know each other, and I don't think the world revolves around me or my loved ones BUT as customers, we want to 1) eat good food, and at a sit down establishment such as Cheesecake ... 2) be made feel our business is valued and presence desired. If someone is having a special day (especially) and we've chosen the establishment you work at to celebrate, it's extremely insulting to be treated with total apathy regarding customer service in general, much less that something special is happening. After all, it's why you .... the waiter or waitress .... are able to collect a tip which should be commensurate with your level of service (the waitress is fortunate I have enough integrity and too big a conscience to NOT leave a 0% tip ... but in hindsight, I truly wish I would have). The night we attended was my Daughter's 23rd birthday and an ideal rendezvous point for ""the rest of the family"" to meet with her and her fiance (who had just proposed in a helicopter just prior to meeting us). After having waited an hour and fifteen minutes to be seated, it was another 15 minutes after being shown to the table before we were greeted by our waitress. After being informed by a member of our party as to ""the birthday girl"" being present as well as the proposal just having happened, the waitresses response was an indifferent ""Oh"" followed by a monotone request to another guest asking them what they wanted. We had to ask 3 times for straws. My daughter's steak was served with no knife, and we sat for another 10-15 waiting to see her before finally flagging a different waiter down (we were also brought our straws by a different male waiter). Additionally, I placed my order and our waitress was gone for 15 minutes before returning to tell me they no longer carry that item on the menu and she'd forgotten to tell me previously. When leaving, she dumped a dirty fork in my GFs lap (who was wearing a white dress) and responded (still consistently apathetic) by saying ""Yeah, I saw it going over the side there"", but didn't apologize at all. In fact, not once was there an apology for anything being slow, forgotten, etc.  What makes this all more insulting is observing this waitress's service to the female couple at the table just next to ours. One of the female customers informed the waitress she'd just proposed to her (now) fiance sitting next to her, and they were engaged. It was the first (and only) semblance I saw of happiness, kindness, and customer service come from this waitress and one would think they'd all been life long besties based on the warm socializing and prompt customer service that consistently transpired.  The ONLY saving grace to this place getting 2 stars vs 1, is the 2 male waiters that assisted with our table. They seemed genuinely concerned as to whether we had what we needed, and displayed more sense of urgency in meeting our needs than what was actually necessary, but given our waitress's behavior, it was simply nice to see and much appreciated. Food was (at least) consistent with what can be expected at Cheesecake Factory. If it's a regular night out, you're not in any kind of hurry, and customer service is irrelevant as long as food is good, then ""sure""go here. If there's any kind of special event going on and you don't wanted it tainted by someone with an absolute shite attitude serving you, it's worth giving consideration to another location. Despite seeing positive reviews as well regarding this particular CF, it's interesting to note the parallels in description of bad service for those who also rated it poorly. Guess we were one of the unlucky ones, and my advice is to not take the dice roll if it's an important occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=340

I remember when i was younger (junior high / high school  age) I loved the food and their encyclopedia sized menu. However since I've become an adult I have realized that the food quality is not there for the price, the service is just kind of meh and that encyclopedia i mentioned earlier is actually a bit alarming; they can really keep ALL of the ingredients on deck with out anything going bad? Just a little OCD, I'm sure it's fine, right? I guess It depends on the time of day and the server but in the last handful of visits I can't remember ever leaving and saying that was a fabulous meal or that was great service. If you're just looking for cheese cake and a view this place would definitely be more like 4 stars.

Farah R.,"Lawndale, CA",15,71,9,4.0,8/30/2014,"I have been coming here for years. I frequent this Cheesecake Factory and the one in Marina Del Rey. If you want a beautiful view of the marina, you should visit the latter. This one does have a gorgeous view of the boat slips and yachts during the day, but there is no light at night so you can't see anything except the hotel/restaurant across the water. However, the romantic ambiance makes up for the lack of view at night. Every time I have come here, I have enjoyed  the food. Maybe nice or twice the service was a miss, but I won't complain too much because again, the good is amazing. My favorite appetizers are the Firecracker Shrimp and the Buffalo Blasts (cheesy chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce all wrapped in a pastry crust and deep fried to resemble a crunchy, meat-pie-shaped egg roll - pure heaven).  Main course favorites are Madeira Chicken and Shrimp, Orange Flavored Beef and their BBQ Beef Shortribs (melt in your mouth). And you can't go wrong with any dessert. They are all delicious. The Ghiradelli Brownie Sundae that we had last week was divine. At least 3 tables next to us asked us what it was because of the presentation.

Sarina V.,"Los Angeles, CA",801,553,1304,4.0,4/9/2013,"First time at this location. I do love cheesecake factory, I think most of their food is delicious and their cheesecakes are bomb, some dishes are lacking in flavor that I've tried in the past but I usually stick to what I know.  However this time, since I came for lunch instead of dinner, I didn't get my usual Chicken Madeira, but the new dishes I tried this time were satisfying! Once we got there, majority of the parkin lot is VALET, then a really small parking lot for self park with like 15-20 spots maybe on the right side. I REPEAT, YOU ARE NOT FORCED TO VALET, THEY HAVE THE PUNY PARKING LOT AND YOU CAN ALWAYS METER PARK ACROSS THE STREET.   I didn't want to wait for valet or pay, it's cheesecake factory, come on -__-  So we waited for awhile in the small parking lot and got a spot! First off...I loveeee their bread! Whats even better is if you order it with alfredo sauce! (5+++) The alfredo sauce is SOOOO GOOD. I'm always going to get a side of this when I come to cheescake now! Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich (grilled instead) (4)- cooked perfectly and good flavor! It had a nice buffalo flavor to it too! Baja Chicken Tacos (4)- yummy, came with like 4 tacos, lots of food! The flavor was really good, could have used more sauce and halfway through it became soggy and the tortillas were falling apart, thus the 4 stars. Still enjoyed the flavor and would order again, just need to eat faster! Also I reallllllyyy liked how they prepared the rice! It was with like a cilantro mixture or something.  Too full from bread to order dessert, but the service was great even on a busy easter Sunday.

Sarah C.,"Portland, OR",223,369,1222,1.0,11/15/2012,"I had an early morning flight out of PDX & didn't give myself enough time to eat breakfast. The little bag of peanuts provided on the plane wasn't enough to carry me over so by the time my plane landed in LAX I was famished. I met with my cousin, her fiancé & his family for lunch here at the Factory. This wouldn't be my first choice of places to eat & obviously we wouldn't be here if they had sought guidance through Yelp. My cousin & I ended up sharing a pizza & I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio. The pizza was an unmemorable one. Maybe two hours later, while we're driving down the freeway, I started to feel nauseous. It was bumper-to-bumper traffic & as time passed I became worse. We finally made it to the mall where I was to meet my aunt & other cousin & I couldn't keep it in any longer. I got sick & it was embarrassing since I just met my cousin's fiancé for the first time only a few hours before. I continued to get sick throughout the wedding rehearsal & rehearsal dinner to a point where I wasn't sure if I'd make the wedding the following day. In the end I did make it feeling 100% better. I couldn't figure out if it was the food or the wine but my postprandial experience was unappreciated. I've eaten at other Cheesecake Factory's in the U.S. & it just hasn't ever tasted good to me.

There's an upstairs area for separate parties. The other night, my party sat outside. The heat lamp provided adequate warmth, but the seating was a bit tight with the table directly behind us. That was a minor bummer. As for the rest, you should know what to expect when eating here. It's a semi-formal experience, and the atmosphere is usually pretty loud, again, this is expected.

But since I asked to speak to the manager after the parking attendant insulted me and said, ""when you come back later it might be different "" in his broken Spanglish. (Obviously threatening to vandalize my car)... The manager 'was too busy to take my call'... I figured what's the use with a detailed rant. I will say, if the owners care...this had been a preferred restraunt to take clients and out of town guest. My companies employees spend 700. - 1500 a week entertaining client. I have heard complaints about service and parking but looked the other way. As a result of my personal experience, Monday morning I ordered my entire staff the this establishment is off limits for any company expeditures. Why did I post this? they don't care! (Our ledger reflects we spent 14700 dollars there last fiscal year and they are loosing that to a quite receptive and wonderful neighbor.

Ivana B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",39,20,5,4.0,3/13/2013,"First let me say that this is my favorite Cheesecake location to go to simply because of the staff and its outdoor seating. Moving on... The parking situation can be tricky if you go during their busy hours (duh) but it's valet so you only have to deal with it until you get to the front of the line. Parking is $4. There's always people who are a bit fishy when it comes to valet parking but I've never had a problem here. They open the door for you, tell you everything you need to know, and send you on your way. When it's time to go home they get your car to you ASAP, they run to it like they're in some kind of competition. It's especially appreciated during cold nights. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their outdoor seating. The entire time you're eating you have a view of all the boats docked at the harbor. During the day you have the sun shining with a pleasant breeze and when the sun begins to set it looks really pretty. For those colder nights you find yourself sitting outside they have heaters which definitely do their job because I have never been cold out there but I always have issues when I go to other places.  Indoor seating is pretty much 'seen one, seen all' as far as Cheesecake goes. There's  nothing really special. I've eaten inside once and I have no complaints, I just prefer sitting outdoors.  Now, the staff. Umm I wish these people worked EVERYWHERE. I have never once had an issue with anyone who has been assigned to my table. There's never been an attitude and most of the time I end up having a great conversation with them. For my last birthday at one point we carried on a lengthy conversation with someone who wasn't even assigned to us, he was so animated and hilarious! I definitely love that I never have to worry about how my service is going to be when I go here, they have won me over.  The food is your regular Cheesecake food, there's nothing special here that you can't find in other locations. My favorite thing to get would have to be the sweet corn tamale cakes, which are great for sharing with the entire table, and the herb crusted fillet of salmon. The salmon comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus with some kind of sauce. It's my go-to dish if I don't want to flip pages. The cheesecake...there are no flaws. My favorite is the basic strawberry one but I've tried many of them and they all are sooooo good. During the holidays they always seem to throw in a new flavor so if you're a fan of christmas candy chances are one of those will end up being an inspiration for their season cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=380

We planned a surprise dinner here for my mother because it's her favorite place for dessert. We had two waiters that never seemed to care to check up on us. It wasn't that busy for a Friday night either. They took our orders and only brought out half the items and we had to keep reminding them we still were missing drinks, utensils, etc. We were charged for the wine which was never brought to us, the waiter never brought my father a straw after asking 3 times for one which was starting to get annoying at that point. We finally had to ask for a manager and much to my surprise he was not at all that helpful. Never once did he apologize for what was supposed to be a nice dining experience for my mothers birthday.

Booker P.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,17,,3.0,5/7/2016,"I used to eat here all the time, and after not visiting them for several years went twice in one week. The place is apply named, a factory where the service is fast and efficient- and you feel like an item on the assembly line being pushed along. The food does come out fast but they appear to be cutting corners to achieve the speed.     For appetizers we ordered a tamale dish, and it was amazing- sweet little corn cakes with a cilantro sauce. We also had some chips with delicious fresh guacamole.    As an entree, I ordered two of my old favorites, the Cajun pasta and Evelyn's pasta. In both dishes it appeared that the pasta was prepared ahead of time and allowed to dry out before the sauce was added. For the Cajun pasta the linguini was clumped together as we have all seen happen when pasta sits in a colander after being cooked. A bit over cooked, on the mushy side, too. The Evelyn's had a different problem- way too much oil and the rigatoni had a rubbery texture. One other person in our party of six ordered the same dish and had a similar comment about chewing on rubber. My guess is they make these ahead of time and let them sit under a heat lamp. Some advice- call Gordon Ramsay for a review of the methods in your kitchen and an update to that stuck in the eighties menu.    I always liked the atmosphere, sitting by Redondo's sleepy little small craft harbor where you can catch a view of the sunset. It is disappointing to see an enormous wall has been built on one side of the property, just a few feet from their outdoor patio, blocking the view to the north practically from the street to the water. I don't understand how they allowed the hotel developer to build such an eyesore. This restaurant has given Redondo Beach millions of dollars over the years. Surely the Cheesecake Factory management could have fought to stop this monstrosity from being built, or at least restrict it to a reasonable size.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=380

When he introduced us to our real server we were disappointed.  The high level of care our break-server gave us was quickly downgraded to a server that took 5-8 minutes to refill our drinks, bring us dessert, and bring the check.  No one wants to wait around for dessert and then wait for the check.  I almost didn't want to eat my cheesecake in protest!  But it was a ""Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.

Ron Mexic O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",10,25,1,2.0,9/18/2015,"This is a review about Cheesecake Factory in general. Not just this location.  I've been to many different Cheesecake Factories around L.A. The service and facility is the same across the board, very good. Everything is usually clean, the servers are nice and attentive, I'm usually there for a special occasion, people are happy, and the food is good. Corporate must be cutting costs because I've noticed a steady decline in the past few years. Portions have gotten smaller and the ingredients and quality are not what they used to be. Add this to rising prices and this may be the last time I go to Cheesecake Factory for a while if ever again.  What corporate and management fail to realize is that most people go to Cheesecake Factory for special occasions and/or want a meal that is not typical and will therefore pay accordingly. They can dim the lights all they want and upgrade the architecture to Michaelangelo or Da Vinci levels, but the bottomline is the food has to be up to par...it no longer is.

We finally just said ok lets just go sit inside. Our server was Alberto he was pretty nice, professional, and very patient.  We ordered our food quickly, got our drinks,and bread.

Gabriel P.,"El Segundo, CA",144,26,4,1.0,6/16/2016,"Just came home from celebrating my sons 8th grade promotion. Some of the worst service and lack of accountability I've seen with a restaurant of this caliber (which is above average) for our family. My plate came out 20 minutes after my party was complete. Our server simply asked if I wanted to take my order to go, I asked to remove it from bill, which resulted in no dinner for me and a fat bill minus my food that never came. She acted as if she was doing something good for us by asking to package it to go (yet still charge me for it). I asked for bill, and that took another 30 minutes to arrive. The server didn't offer to pack up our leftovers but simply handed us boxes and bags (even when we asked if they could pack it for us). All we received was a blank stare and a shrug followed by her exiting the table. After asking to speak to manager he took our bill went to back and came with new bill minus two appetizers and the plate I never received. In my eyes he made no effort to save our business at this location, especially after telling him we eat at cheesecake factory often. I will go out of my way to drive further to another location in LA. To top it off, our server never came once to check on us or are if we needed anything..our party was 7 people. Needless to say this sucks, but even more so that this was the place my son chose to eat it to celebrate his middle school promotion. Even after all that I still bought cheesecake to go because the server never asked if we wanted dessert. How can you go to cheesecake factory and not be offered cheesecake? Oh..forgot to add that I was offered an unsolicited bowl of orange soup while I waited..had no idea what kind it was not was I told what it was..I told them no thank you and watched them take the same soup to a table a few rows down?

The Pros:   1. They seated my party of 10 after 15 minutes when we were told it would be about an hour. 2. The staff was courteous, prompt, attentive but not intrusive, and accommodating. 3. The appetizers, and cheesecake were amazing.  The entree's were above average for everyone but myself, however to be fair, I ordered something that I typically wouldn't order because I was feeling adventurous, so I am going to give them a pass on that. The Cons: 1. They basically require that you use their valet service to park your car and then they charge you for it.  I would expect an establishment of this perceived class to comp the valet if they are going to require that you use it. 2. Upon arrival we were told that one member of our party had to wait in a special area for the manager who was walking around the restaurant surveying open tables and availability to come and quote you a time to seating.  The rest of my party was told to wait in the bar.  This was a family birthday dinner for my daughter, so I was required to be separated from my family on my daughters birthday so that I could wait for 15 minutes so that the manager could tell me that it was going to be an hour until they could seat us.  They provided me with a buzzer, why couldn't they have told me that they were going to alert me as to when the manager was available to speak with me? 3. The bar menu doesn't list pricing for cocktails.  Had I known the bottom shelf, weak and flavorless martini's were going to be $12 each, I would not have ordered them.  At least I know for next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=400

Kerry B.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,46,170,2.0,9/30/2014,"This was my first time going to my favorite restaurant chain on the west coast and I was disappointed at the service. I ordered a shrimp scampi and cheesecake which in and of themselves were good. A little too much lemon in the scampi but still awesome nonetheless. I got my food to go and didn't dine in. Usually for takeout orders if I have a few spare dollars I'll throw it in a tip jar or just tip in person. Today was one of the days I didn't have some extra dollars. Usually for dine-ins I tip 20% and up. Well I guess the cashier may have took it to heart. First of all, when I ordered on the phone the lady asked me if I'd like bread and butter and I told her sure, whole wheat. I paid for the order before the food came out of course. When it finally arrived, the cashier looked at the signed receipt and then came the change. It was only the shrimp scampi, no bread. I told her politely I asked for bread, she asked me what kind (hello, didn't I already specify on the phone with my order someone wrote down?) went to the back, came round and said it was all gone, do I want sourdough (yuck). Then she asked if I needed utensils, I said sure and then I arrive home and there's no utensils! I don't want to make a mountain out of a mole hill but to me it seems suspect. I hope I am wrong but I doubt it. Not getting the utensils despite her asking me and motioning as if to put it in the bag is what aroused my suspicions. I don't think I'll be getting takeout there again.

Alyssa J.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,4,1,4.0,5/5/2015,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon for a friend's birthday dinner. Our server Adrian was amazing. Three of those stars are for him and his great service. He rattled off the daily specials without missing a beat and had a smile on his face the whole time. We asked him a question about one of the drinks and he gave his honest opinion, which being a server I can appreciate. Our drinks did take a little while to come out but we saw he had a large party and he was apologetic and came back often to check on us. Our meal was delicious and served piping hot. I had the chicken bellagio and it was amazing. Anything with prosciutto has me sold. My boyfriend got the  margherita pizza and it was good too. My friend got the chicken Madeira and told me to find the recipe for it because she liked it so much. We ordered some cheesecakes to go because it was fight night and the boys were getting restless. The only thing that spoiled the note was actually right toward the beginning of the meal before we had even sat down.  We were given the option of dining room or patio and since it was nearing sunset we chose the patio. When we were being walked to our table we noticed it was a little far and we were passing a lot of empty tables. We kept walking father back. We were sat at the absolute last table on the patio, next to the server station where you can hear their conversations, people would pass by us with trays of dishes and when the drop the plates down it sounded pretty loud . It was a little noisy so my friend's husband asked if we could be sat somewhere closer to the middle or even the table next to us which had a great view of the water. She said no that table wasn't available. We didn't question any further because we just wanted to have a good time. About 2 minutes passed and they came back and we're going to sit three men at a table in the middle but asked to sit at the same table we tried to sit at. They led them straight to it while at my table we all just kind of looked at each other. My friend told me that she kind of felt discriminated against because we didn't get a choice when three white men did. Were all pretty young and Hispanic.

Especially since we are all the way out in Redondo beach and going to a restaurant that is just right around the corner from us back at home! Really??  But I had not been to a Cheesecake Factory in years (unless I was picking up a cheesecake which I DO recommend) and I was pleasantly surprised to a section of small plates/tapas in the tome of a menu!  Right up my alley! I was able to talk one of the other guests at the table into sharing several small plates and having a tapas style meal.  The bread is still good just as I remember it. Chewy, dense, whole grain or squaw style.  I sipped on my Strawberry martini while enjoying the view of boats bobbing on the water.  And when all the little tapas arrived, I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The Pear gorgonzola flatbread was nice. I do however prefer the pear cut into thinner slices blanketed over the bread so there is a more perfect amount of pear in each bite. These were big cubes sprinkled on so some bites had too much pear, and other bites no pear at all.  The white bean hummus was very nice and creamy. Good texture.  Stuffed mushrooms were bathed in a nice sauce and very flavorful.  But the highlight for me was the wonderful kale salad. It's so nice to see raw kale salads more often when I go out. I usually  have to make these at home myself. The others companions with me didn't  even know you could eat kale raw. They all loved this salad. I would probably be willing to go back to CF to try more of the small plates and get more kale salad.

Mark C.,"Torrance, CA",129,576,668,2.0,8/8/2012,"First off, you're forced to use the valet which costs $3.50. If you're looking for a nice, cozy place to eat where you can view the ocean, you're not gonna find it here. This Cheesecake Factory is usually busy and packed.  Our waiter Darren was a complete gentlemen who was very knowledgeable about the menu and the current discounts of the day. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich. I did have to wait a little longer for whatever reason to get my order but at least the sandwich was quite delicious. The salad that came with it wasn't so bad either.  But looking at the name of this place, I just simply had to try out an actual cheesecake. We ordered a whole pie... Hrm, that sounds awkward... What do you call a whole circle of cheesecake anyway? In any case, I have to say that I was disappointed with it. For a place to be called Cheesecake Factory and not have the ability to churn out superb cheesecake is as disappointing as everyone in your life forgetting it's your birthday.  You know, if we're gonna have to pay $3.50 for valet, I expect them to retrieve my car in a timely fashion. We had to wait outside far longer than we had to. It actually would have been faster for us to walk to our car and drive out of there ourselves.  Finally, I didn't see any Vultures, Siege Tanks, Hellions, Thors, or Goliaths around. I asked if they used an infernal pre-igniter upgrade to defrost their cheesecakes. All I got was a look of bewilderment.

We got the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta & White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake..everything was yum! The reason I'm taking 2 stars away was for the service. Our waitress seemed very rushed the entire evening and forgot to get us stuff like lemon for the water, straws and the bread (my fav part of dining there)! Even when she would stop by to check on us, she would literally be walking by our table and quickly say, ""howsthefoodiseverythinggoodgreat!"". I'm just like, huh? Can you please speak a bit slower and actually STOP at our table to ask if everything is fine?? Another thing that annoyed me was where we got seated. We were seated in a 2-person booth which was adjacent to the kitchen. They had a window on the wall where we could see the kitchen. Some people might like that but I definitely did not. I could just hear pots and pans being banged around and the kitchen staff talking and laughing loudly. So much so that I could barely hear our own conversation. As you can imagine, with a frustrating dining experience like this, I definitely don't think I will go to this Cheesecake Factory location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=400

Ten minutes later, and we still couldn't find a spot; so we went to another parking service and were told that they are full. In the end, we had to street park the car, 400 feet away, and walk.

Andrea S.,"Lawndale, CA",48,12,11,3.0,3/11/2014,"I REALLY want to give this four stars, but I'll explain why I didn't. So I've been a guest at the Cheesecake Factory a number of times over the years with above average service. The food quality is overall pretty good. Deserts are amazing as always. Be prepared to be willing to spend some money as it is more of a high end restaurant.  So I went today for my brothers 22nd birthday. We sat outside, and although it was chilly, the windows block out wind and the heaters do an amazing job. Our server Cid, was a good server. Not too talkative, just did a basic server job. Now I work in the restaurant business and I know 7 steps of service. Food took about 25 minutes which isn't horrible but a little lengthy. I ordered the lemon herb chicken as that was what he recommended. I don't eat bone in skin chicken and I thought the chicken would be breasts, now a full half chicken. I was pretty disappointed but I figured to try it out. The flavor was bland. I had a different server take it back. My meal was comped off, but my appetite was ruined. Another reason why I give this 3 versus 4 stars is because my dad had ordered a cheesecake and I had told the server previously it was my brothers birthday. So I figured they'd bring him out a complimentary sundae like they did a table nearby. But instead our server decided to assume that my dad was ordering the cheesecake as a birthday desert and not to go. I mean I'm sorry, but maybe you should clarify with your guests and communicate I bit better to avoid such mistakes. If I could, it'd be 4 stars. But as of now, it remains at 3!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=440

Marlena S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",203,239,27,4.0,12/5/2013,"I'll preface this review by saying that I'm not, in general, a huge fan of chain restaurants, so I am biased against giving any Cheesecake Factory 5 stars as no Cheesecake Factory has ever ""wowed"" me. However, if you are generally a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, then the one in Redondo Beach is a lovely location overlooking the RB Harbor, and on a sunny afternoon, I would try for the coveted patio seating. If you prefer inside, there are rows of booths and tables lining up near the window for the ocean view. I have found the service to be good at all of my visits.  -Valet parking is $4, but there is also metered street parking (coins only). -Cheesecake Factory doesn't take  reservations, and this location can become especially busy on weekend nights.  -There is event space upstairs that is nice for large group events.  Finally, in my most recent visit I tried the asparagus salad with olive oil, pine nuts, sun dried tomatoes and a fried egg on top. It was DELICIOUS!!  I also had the soup of the day, the mushroom soup, and I also really enjoyed it!

Most of the servers are quick and attentive, if you get the one that's not, there are plenty of others that can help and make sure your waiter is around at all times. I've tried a few appetizers: egg rolls, potstickers, popcorn shrimp, calamari, and macaroni balls. However, they serve delicious bread that's fulfilling just by itself. The servings are a decent size and many times enough to take home. I've tried a few plates but I always go back to my favorite, the CHICKEN & BISCUITS! it's so delicious I'm getting hungry just writing this = ) I definitely recommend trying a cheesecake slice, it goes perfect with the meal, and there are plenty of different selections to choose from.

As soon as we sat down I noticed the table had been cleared, but it didn't seem like anyone had wiped it down. There were still remnants of food from the last party who had sat there and my appetizer plate was dirty.  There were also a few ants on the table, which didn't make things seem very appetizing.

Miguel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",643,894,860,4.0,3/28/2012,"Cheesecake and Factory aren't really appealing words on their own and put together to name a restaurant they are not very appealing either. Not very creative. I'm not going to judge this book by its cover though. Oh, and I am not the typical Yelper that gives chain restaurants a default 3 every time haha! MINUS ONE STAR THOUGH FOR THE FACT YOU HAVE TO USE A VALET TO PARK HERE! NEEDLESS TO SAY IT IS NOT FREE! UGH! Anyway, the host and hostess that greeted us were very courteous. The lobby is quite cute. They have white doves painted up above. Both times we have been here we have been seated by the windows which afford a great view of the marina! Simply romantic, and I mean even on a night which isn't really supposed to be romantic. There's nothing like the shimmering reflection of lights on the ocean! The walls are painted a nice yellowish color and the ceiling is covered with material that makes for good acoustics. The lighting is great! Very romantic for something like a factory that serves cheesecake haha! We started off with Grilled Artichokes. My BF who loves them says they do them exceptionally well here. I enjoyed them too. They are served with a vinaigrette type sauce and an aioli type sauce. I ordered the Miso Salmon. Superb! Great portion of salmon and great portion of white rice. It tastes like a subtle combination of miso paste and teriyaki sauce. It's on the sweet side. Very tasty! Fresh crisp snowpeas accompany the salmon as garnishes. The presentation is gorgeous. My only critique would be of the buttery sauce they add around the rice. It really seems to be just part of the garnishing and it's not tasty at all. The Orange Chicken my BF ordered was really, really good. It's a very filling plate. I think that this is among the best Orange Chicken plates I have ever had! The chicken is flavorful and soft. The taste of orange is not terribly subtle. It's just right. Our servers have been very attentive and friendly both times. They were so good at their job we made remarks about it at the dinner table. This place is a pleasant surprise. Most chain restaurants tend to get three stars on Yelp. This is a good example of why even chain restaurants should be reviewed since the managers make a big difference. There is also the fact each restaurant has its idiosyncrasies. This one has its nice view and the deplorable parking situation (both times we have been here we could see no reason for the need of valet parking since the lot did not get full). Thanks to the ambience and service and quality of the food I highly recommend this restaurant. What did Elites think about this place? The overall Elite rating of this place is 3.4 stars.

Nicole S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",206,74,7,3.0,8/6/2014,"My hubby and I took our two boys out for a family date night this past Sunday and choose the Cheesecake Factory.  Upon arrival, there was a huge amount of people waiting for tables but I have to say that it was only about a 15 minute wait.  Not bad.  However, the clientele that was there was pretty gross.  Nobody dressed up to go out to eat.  What's wrong with people these days?  It was loud.  People were pushy.  I understand it's not a 5 star restaurant but they are still going out to eat.  Put a little effort into yourself and don't talk so loud that everybody around you can hear you!  A lady kept talking about how tall I was hoping that I would chime in...  Finally, she tugs on my arm and asks how tall I am.  Funny.... My son ordered chicken breast w/ veggies and mashed potatoes off of the kids menu.  Super yummy.  My other son ordered the burrito off of the adults menu.  It was HUGE but also yummy.  I ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp.  It was yummy but not what you'd expect...  but delicious all the same.  Not sure I would order it again as it was a little heavy and I felt like my butt was growing as I took each bite!  lol  My hubby ordered some noodle dish and it SUCKED.  He barely ate any of it.  The waiter asked if everything was okay and I told him that my hubby's dish was not good.  He just did the ""oooooh"" sad face.  The end.  What?!  No trying to make it better or even seem interested.  I would want to know more being that he could at least make a recommendation to the kitchen or future guests...   We all ordered a cheesecake each to take home. You can't go wrong with any choice you make.  I ordered the carrot cake which was very light.  I think this was the least of my favorite as it didn't have much flavor.  No true carrot cake / spice flavor that you would expect.  The fudge cake was amazing!  and the red velvet cake was superb!  the smokes cheese cake was my husband's choice but I didn't try it....   All in all, if you want a good meal but a loud environment...  go here.  The menu is HUGE!!!  They even have an entire ""skinny menu"" to choose from if you are cautious with what goes into your body.   Our bill was $150...  not the cheapest date night but we did order a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=420

It's beautiful at night of course.  I was pleased with the way I was treated there. Very nice.  I'm not a pig ok...but I opened the take-out tray and for $17+ tax, what was in there looked like leftover portion.

The service was friendly and attentive, but the food was underwhelming for the price. I had the Tuna Tataki Salad with big slices of seared Ahi tuna. It was a refreshing dish, but I'm glad I got the dressings on the side because they were pretty oily and heavy, although savory. My mom got the shrimp jambalaya and did not enjoy it very much.

The appetizers are of large proportions so, you can actually have that and skip the entrée. Parking really bites the big one! There is a small free parking area to the right as you pull up. The rest in valet. I usually check to see if there are any available free spaces before paying for valet. Shhhh... I've noticed that the bartenders have  heavy hands.

Clifford P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,101,,4.0,7/31/2014,"Actually 3.5 stars, but in honor of National Cheesecake Day, I rounded up to 4. Some basics first. They have a very small lot for self parking and take-out (it was completely full when we got there), valet parking is $4. They don't take reservations, so it's best to arrive either very early or very late. Despite being a large restaurant, expect a wait if arriving during prime dinner hours. On our visit, we arrived around 5:30pm and were told we could be seated immediately inside, but there would be a long wait for outside seating. We opted to sit inside. We started with 2 appetizers, Fried Calamari and Crispy Crab Wontons. The calamari was perfectly cooked, nice crispy exterior, and came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce. The wontons were also well prepared and came with a sweet chili sauce. For our entrees, we ordered the Mushroom Burger, Pepperoni Pizza, Chicken Enchiladas, Grilled Coulotte Steak, and Renee's Special which consisted of a 1/2 turkey sandwich, cup of soup du jour, and a small green salad. Everyone seemed to enjoy their entree except for the Chicken Enchiladas. The black beans and cilantro rice were both surprisingly spicy, and the enchiladas themselves were just so-so. The desserts were the highlight of our meal, as should be expected from a restaurant named Cheesecake Factory. We ordered the Dulce de Leche Caramel, Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore, Pineapple Upside-Down, and Wild Blueberry White Chocolate cheesecakes. All were equally good in their own right. Each came with a double portion of whipped cream, and each slice could have been easily shared by 2 or 3 people. Needless to say, we ended up taking home quite a few leftovers. Service was courteous and efficient, with our drinks and food arriving promptly after ordering, and soft drinks being refilled as needed. The Cheesecake Factory boasts quite an extensive menu (I lost count after page 15 ...) with seemingly endless choices for appetizers, entrees, and of course, cheesecakes.

Kirk M.,"Hemet, CA",58,19,9,5.0,11/6/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet when dining out - but the Redondo Beach location may be the very best location in the entire chain. We almost always sit out on the patio (even in oh-so-cold January), as the heaters more than compensate for the cool temperatures. It's just so therapeutic to us to dine and enjoy the view of the Redondo marina just a few feet away. The service is EXCELLENT, particularly Anthony, Kacey, Melinda, Klare, Robert, Sandymar, Sean, Summer, Heather, Mariel, Antoinette and Amber (yes, we've been there a few times). Some of our particular favorites on the menu include the Mexican Tortilla Salad, Sheila's Cashew Chicken Salad, the Kobe Burger (with green salad), the Buffalo Blasts, Onion Rings, Fish & Chips, the Tuscan Salad, and the Huevos Rancheros. And of course, the cheesecake rocks - Vanilla Bean is one of our favorites, but the pumpkin cheesecake in October and November is a definite treat. The Key Lime/Mango cheesecake is like having a bite of a summer day. I have it on good authority from my wife that the Pomegranate Margarita is da bomb, too (I don't drink, so I have to take her word for it). You can park on the street for $1/hour (bring quarters), but you're going to be there at least two hours, and Redondo PD is very aggressive with ticketing. The valet parking for $4.00 is worth not having to hassle with the street parking and the parking enforcement.

So far I've read other Yelper's unpleasant experience is because they thought the server thought they were young and would not tip well? Hello?? How judgmental is that? Sometimes it's the elderly that doesn't tip well! If the service is good, I will tip you well!  It was not that busy that night and it literally...I mean literally took 20 mins to have anyone come to our table to ask for beverages or any sorts of greeting.

Shortly after that, she stumbled to the table next to ours and apologizing to them about slow service. OH I know she knew we were listening to her apologizing. ummm WOW, they have their drinks, appetizers and gets treated like a royalty... Oh yah, I forgot, they were older than us.

Yah yah, the view was suppose to be nice but whatever! You can go to other location and have better service. Poor service can ruin your mood.

We were served a plate of avocado egg-rolls and right before any of us touched the plate, we noticed two egg-rolls were about half the size of the rest. Upon further inspection we noticed teeth marks in the egg-rolls  along with a crescent shaped bite mark. We couldn't believe what we saw and so told the waitress someone had obviously taken a bite. She agreed and apologized and said she would inform the manager who we never saw. We at least expected to be comped the egg-rolls which didn't happen (they brought us a second plate, bite mark free which we paid for) but we're really disappointed we didn't even have our issue addressed with management.

Serg M.,"Torrance, CA",65,76,15,4.0,7/3/2013,"Usually my reviews focus on the food and customer service. This review will specifically focus on the service. Food was excellent. not going to lie. Its so good that I have been back once since then. Our waitress did a job, on a scale of 1 to 10; an 8. She was tired and overworked (been on shift nearly 12 hrs). When we got the bill, we specifically instructed her to split the bill in half charge the $24 tip on my friends card since the other person was their guest. Anyway, a few days later...I called the bank to inform them I lost my ATM card and if there were any charges in the last few days. The only charge was Cheesecake Factory at 64 dollars. It should have been 40 for the meal. The server ended up charging both me and my friend 24 dollars each. That's $48 for a $80 meal. That's b.s. No way we are paying more than 50% for tip. I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, Robert Ghyczy. I explained to him the situation and said he would investigate. He kept calling every 20-30 minutes for about 2 hrs keeping me updated, which I truly appreciate. He found the mistake and offered to return the money on the card which would have taken up to 6 weeks (stupid merchant policy IMO on their bank) or take a gift card which would only take 3-5 business days to arrive at my house. I choose the gift card.

. ..,"Hermosa Beach, CA",4999,903,1604,2.0,8/3/2014,"My friend and I attended a late lunch / early dinner last night here at the Cheesecake Factory. We had a party of 9 and upon placing our name on the waiting list we waited about 20+ minutes for a table which seemed like a long wait because at the time we arrived the CCF was not all that busy.  Upon being seated we had a short wait for our server to show up which was fine because it gave members of our party time to talk. A server finally arrived and took our drink order. From the time our drink orders were placed until the time they arrived on the table was a good 10 minutes. I ordered water with lime; my drink was served in a plastic mug with melted ice and no straw, not that big of a deal but you expect a higher level of service at the CCF.  I took a look at the menu and had forgotten how many things are on the menu. My mother used to tell me never trust a restaurant with lots of items on the menu which is a good point, how do these restaurants keep all of these items fresh? The simple answer is they usually cannot. With this is mind I went with a simple order. I ordered a chicken club with avocado on toasted wheat bread with no mayonnaise & no cheese. I also asked for the chicken on the sandwich to be grilled / cooked until it was black / burnt. I had the choice of having French fries or a green salad as a side; I decided to go with the green salad.  The other members of our party ordered rice, to herb roasted chicken, to soup, to salads & burgers. The wait for the food to come out again took quite some time. When the food finally arrived at the table it was subpar at best. The wheat bread I had asked for was now soggy white bread which was barely even toasted, the green side salad I had ordered was wilted and when I finally picked up my sandwich it literally fell apart in my hand. I ended up taking the sandwich apart and eating the rest of it with a fork. When I took the sandwich apart I observed the chicken to have no grill marks, it was not blackened and it was not even close as ordered. I ate maybe half of the sandwich and decided to not test out the wilted greens that looked like they had not seen the inside of a refrigerator in quite sometime. During the course of our meal which lasted almost 2 hours I was never once asked if I wanted more water which I finished quickly while trying to wash down my meal.  My friend ordered the herb roasted chicken which she only finished 1/3 of. I will have to say that I had a bite of the mashed potatoes that came with her meal and they were good but not great. The mashed potatoes were lumpy with the potato skins blended in which is just the way I like them.  I was severely disappointed with the quality of my food. The Chef's in the kitchen should also be disappointed in the quality of food they are allowing to leave their kitchen. I love to cook and I know I would of never of served a guest of mine let alone a paying customer a soggy sandwich that is unable to even be held without self-destructing.  I looked around the table and every member of our party had a large majority of their food left over. They were either not all that hungry or like me they found the food to subpar.  We had all spoken about ordering dessert before our food arrived but at the end of our meal everyone decided against it.  There is little to no chance that I visit this location again. The last time I visited the CCF was the location in Marina Del Rey many years ago and I had a very similar experience in regards to the quality of food. In my personal opinion the CCF should focus on reducing their menu to ensure everything that is coming out of the kitchen meets the standards of the prices on the menu and the décor.  There is no self-parking available at the CCF, it is all valet until I believe dinner hours. When dinner hours arrive you are still required to pay a nominal fee to park your vehicle. I refuse to leave my vehicle with a valet and luckily being a surfer who surfs in the general area I knew exactly where to park for free on the street and that is exactly what I did.  I still had an enjoyable time. Our party had a good conversation and good laughs but if I called the food poor that would be giving it an upgrade. As stated above the Chef's working in this kitchen should be embarrassed when a fast food restaurant is putting out better quality food then they are!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=500

AHI TUNA SALAD: The tuna was fresh and the tomatoes were hearty. The avocado was a bit mushy and on the brown side.  On our way home, we all noticed we had a 'funny' taste in our mouths. What was it? Some weird, lingering after taste? I thought it was me 'cuz I had fish but all three of us had it (one friend had fish and chips and the other had a chicken dish) so that's a bit concerning. Four stars for the location/ambiance. Three stars for the food and service. Two stars for the weird after taste feeling we all experienced. $3.50 for valet parking. There was parking located right on the street so if you see some, park there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=500
Pouya J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,4.0,12/2/2013,Cheesecake Factory's food quality varies based on location in my experience. This location is one of the better ones. And I think the portions are bigger here too. Or maybe I was hungrier when I went to the other locations. As always you get plenty of calories per meal and a healthy part of that is coming from carbs and oil. So there's that.  The one thing you only get at this location is the view. Try to get a table on the balcony and sit there looking out on the boat dock. It's quite beautiful. Also try the Arnold Palmer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=500
Jesse P.,"Burlingame, CA",39,84,103,2.0,2/11/2013,"I was here for a wedding in their upstairs private rooms. The atmosphere was warm and the food is what you expect any chain restaurant to be, average.  This place forces you to valet part - no self parking permitted.  Normally this isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially at $4. But they returned my father-in-law's car with a nice dent in the front quarter panel. He also happened to be the father of the bride for the wedding. All the staff acted as though they were not responsible and no one came forward to admit the damage. Very frustrating to deal with considering the damage was not there before entering their property. He was forced to return the next day to fill out a form and speak to a different manager and they still refused to acknowledge their error.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=500

But the strawberry shortcake is what you need to try. It's a shortbread biscuit with sugar crystals baked on top. They cut it in half and stuff it with vanilla ice cream. Then they pour sliced strawberries over it and top it off with whipped cream. That dessert alone gets 5 stars! I gave this location 3 stars because of it's parking. There's only a handful of self parking spots so you're pretty much forced to valet. These valet guys don't really hustle to get your car. Maybe it's just me and my expectations of valet attendants. But most attendants kind of hustle to get my car and I was watching these guys just kinda leisurely walk to get the cars. Not a big deal though I guess.

McKenzie P.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,7,1,5.0,12/5/2013,"Bottom Line: For being a chain restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory sure knows how to deliver. I may have been to many different restaurants of this branch, but this location in particular has now become my favorite. First of all, this location is BEAUTIFUL! I dined here a few nights ago for an early dinner, which meant that my friend are I were able to catch the stunning winter sunset. We chose to sit outside on the patio, and were fortunate enough to be sat at one of the table right by the window. It was a little chilly at first, but after getting settled in, we were able to feel the warmth from the heaters that are scattered all along the patio area. I'll give them one star for their convenient patio with an amazing view. The food here is actually pretty tasty. I ordered the chicken costoletta, and it was so delicious! The chicken was crispy fried, yet it wasn't oily like normal fried chicken. This chicken dish came with some type of creamy lemon sauce, which seemed a little weird to me at first, but it ended up complementing the fried chicken very well. Another star for their killer costoletta. And of course, I couldn't miss out on some cheesecake! My server did her whole show of telling us about the cheesecakes that they're featuring, and also mentioned that one of which that they offered would lead to the company giving 25 cents to Feeding America for every slice sold. I thought that was a pretty nice gesture from the company. My friend and I decided to share a slice of the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake, and my oh my was it amazing! The cheesecake had a perfect mixture of cream and chocolate, maybe even a hint of vanilla? Well whatever is in it sure gave me a reason to add another star. The ambiance at the restaurant was really nice too. Sitting out on the patio was very relaxing. I could feel the cool crisp winter air, but I was still safe from shivering in the cold. The music and talking from other customers seemed very quiet, and it was very easy to have an intimate conversation without feeling like I was yelling to my friend. The patio's calm environment got another star out of me. And finally, the very last star. Why did  I give this restaurant five stars? Well, not only did their food and location make my time here enjoyable, it was also the service. Every employee that came in contact with our table was very kind and helpful. They have so many staff people working here, and I love it! Never once did I feel like I had to search to find someone who could help me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=540

I understood that it was a hectic schedule to go there, but the server that we had was very apologetic and accommodating. He made sure that we had everything we needed. What's more interesting was that the chef went out of his way to give my mom his complimentary soup due to the delay of her dish. The manager checked up on us to make sure that we were having a grand time. And another server went up to me to say I looked great in my dress, and that our last name sounds pretty.

Dani V.,"Torrance, CA",4,2,,1.0,2/14/2015,"I honestly wish negative stars were an option. The most unprofessional establishment I've ever encountered. For Valentine's Day, my husband and I decided to order food to go. Called in our order, gave the worker our phone number (as requested), and told us it would be ready in 25 minutes.  Parking took forever, but it was Valentine's Day at dinner, so I can't be upset about that. We finally got in, paid for our food, and when we were presented with the food, they told us one of the dinners we had ordered is not available at their location yet (though it is advertised) and they were out of the appetizer we ordered. They charged us for both.  My question... It's obviously Valentine's Day. I'm obviously ordering food for two. What kind of an idiot wouldn't think to call the customer and let them know half of their order isn't available?  We told them to forget the entire order. About fifteen minutes later, they refunded the one dinner item only. No... We don't want ANY of it.  Finally, after the second time asking for a manager, we speak with one. She refunded our entire order and told us the money wouldn't show up in our account until the next day or so. She did not offer us any sort of incentive or apology. Unfortunately, I didn't catch her name, but she was rude and sarcastic when saying ""happy Valentine's Day! Have a great night!"" Thank you, Cheesecake Factory, for ruining out first Valentine's dinner as a married couple. Not only did we wait OVER FORTY MINUTES for a refund, we didn't even get a meal.  I will never visit this location again. I am truly disgusted with disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=480
Jenny C.,"Lawndale, CA",88,100,85,3.0,11/21/2013,"Service was slow, i didn't think it was extremely busy, but food was good otherwise. One waitress stopped by to drop off our Portabella Mushroom, Avocado, and Zucchini Fries, but did not pick up our empty plates of what was the Grilled Artichoke--i thought that was weird. Another waitress dropped off two plates since we were sharing, one happens to be dirty. I had to ask for another clean plate. Sanitation is questionable.  Portabella Mushroom, Avocado, and Zucchini Fries were awesome. I would order it again. It was crispy and well-balanced. The veggies were not overpowered by batter. Grilled Artichoke was good, but nothing special. i probably wouldn't order this again. Lemon Herb Chicken; the chicken was slightly dry, but the lemon herb flavor was good. Carrots were cooked perfectly, not too soggy or too crunchy. Mashed potatoes were tasty as always.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=480
Lisa M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1078,909,1293,1.0,6/6/2011,"Came here with a group of 7 to celebrate a friend's birthday, and they buzzed us to tell us our table was ready. We trot in... oops, they buzzed us incorrectly. Gave us a new one. 5 minutes later, we get buzzed, so we trot back in. The lady tells us to stand off to the side and someone will seat us. So we wait. And wait. People who were getting buzzed AFTER us came and left as they were seated. Lots of people. We wait some more.. then when we see them seat another party of 7 before us, we get legitimately pissed off and inquire at the front. It's pretty obvious the hostess lost our name because she keeps scrolling through her screen. After saying that she can't find us, some guy comes by and actually insinuates that it was OUR fault we weren't seated right away because we ""weren't waiting in the correct spot where they told us to."" UHHHH seriously?? I can only assume this guy was some assistant manager, but the restaurant should send him to some customer service classes because he didn't apologize once after realizing that they sat the wrong group and gave away our table. NO APOLOGY. A simple apology would have sufficed, but I guess he's not the bigger person here. So we finally get seated after waiting in the area for 20 minutes (this is AFTER we were buzzed, mind you), and got offered no complimentary appetizers or drinks or desserts or anything to make up for their mistake. Oooook, whatever. We order our food, devour our bread and drinks... what a surprise, our waiter sucked too!! We had to flag him down to get refills, they forgot our friend's beer, and he disappeared when it was time for the check to come. Imagine our anger after learning there's a mandatory tip added to parties of 6 or more. I understand it's pretty much rule to add on gratuity to large parties, but should we still have to pay it when we had the worst service ever? I thinks not, but instead of arguing or making a scene, we decided to swallow our frustration and just pay the bill. Course, it's another 15 minutes before we can get our waiter to come and take the check... he actually ended up NEVER coming to get it, so at this point we just wanted to get the hell out of there. We were about to take the check up to the front when our waiter caught us right before. We're standing around like idiots waiting for this guy to swipe our cards, when the non-helpful assistant manager from before strolls by. I'm guessing he saw our pissed-off faces because he actually bothered to ask if we had a problem this time. Food is consistently decent here, but with their overpriced dishes and pretty horrific service, we all decidedly stated that we're never coming back here again. We were extremely disappointed, not to mention it put a damper on my friend's birthday celebration.

Heather L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/28/2015,"This is my second review. My family, knowing nothing about my previous experience 5 days prior but knowing very well about my love for cheesecake, made reservations for a birthday lunch for me here. Without revealing my sources, I can tell you that I am aware that management knew I was coming. Nonetheless, you did an excellent job of trying to make up for your mistakes. We had a party of 8. We were given the best waiter in the house. Being distracted by the festivities, I did not take note of his name, a lovely gentleman who was very attentive and even anticipated our needs. He was very patient with the 3 young children (and the adults!) when we placed our order. Everything was served promptly. My soda glass was refilled before I even knew it was empty! The food was, as usual, good quality. The best part of the whole meal was the dessert, of course. When they brought my cheesecake out and sang happy birthday, the plate they brought it on had ""Happy Birthday Heather"" written in chocolate with colorful sprinkles scattered around. It was better than any restaurant birthday dessert I have seen! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory management, wait and kitchen staff for taking good care of me on my birthday.  My hope is that this serves as a learning experience. At my initial visit, the lack of attention to my needs as a customer was pervasive, being essentially ignored by multiple staff members. At my second visit it was exactly the opposite. I will be back, by myself sitting in the dining room as before, at sometime in the future.

T A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",4,177,5,2.0,12/19/2012,"The food is okay - nothing wonderful, nothing overly horrible.  There are dishes  I've eaten here that taste good, but it is chain restaurant food and nothing innovative or exciting.  Usually we only come here at someone else's request - but I've never had any huge complaints about it.  It's not my first choice, but we leave full and reasonably pleased.  Recently, however, we had a meal here, and I left feeling pretty dissatisfied.  The drinks: overpriced and weak. The only upside was that I tried a daiquiri and it was made with fresh fruit, yum. But really, $23 plus tip for 2 mediocre mai tais?  Jeeze.  We were here late afternoon and the sun was pouring through the windows, which we were seated next to. Way too bright (necessitated some of us wearing sunglasses), and they don't have any kind of shades?! The service was spotty. Waitress was nice enough, but not really on it. One member of our party was left waiting a good 10 minutes for their food after the rest of us had been served. Really uncool. They have an extensive list of cheesecakes, yet didn't have the first two I attempted to order. Not the biggest deal of the day, just irritating on top of everything else.  Pausing here to say that the reason I give it 2 stars is because of the cheesecake. Only great thing about this place. I love the carrot cake cheesecake, caramel pecan turtle, vanilla bean, strawberry, chocolate tuxedo - really, every one I've tried is great.  I think if I ever return, I'm skipping everything else and just having cheesecake.  The kicker during this most recent visit is that when our bill arrived, one of the items was priced higher than it is shown on the menu. It was only a dollar, but that's not the point. Update the menus to reflect current prices, jeeze! At the end of the day, we paid about $100 total for lunch (for two) and cheesecake, with 3 alcoholic beverages and a strawberry lemonade - and not only did I feel that we didn't get our money's worth, but I could have made a much tastier, healthier lunch at home for less than 1/5 the cost, and with a lot less stress.   Icing on the cake:  I became physically ill before even leaving the premises.  Good times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=560

Belle B.,"Walnut, CA",155,914,12849,4.0,10/1/2010,"Went here for lunch today with a friend.  The valet parking is nice, but for $2.50 I would have preferred to park my own car - if self parking was an option.  We wanted to sit outside, but for some reason they couldn't accomodate the request.  They did sit us at a table with a full marina view. The view is really beautiful, but the sun kept getting in our eyes which was a little bothersome.  My friend ordered coffee and the lunch chinese chicken salad.  The salad came without dressing and with a ton of fried noodles.  When the waitress came back with the dressed salad, she actually put more noodles on the salad.  My friend said the salad was good.  The positive was that they were really attentive with her coffee.  They were quick to offer refills and were very conscious of keeping her coffee warm. I had the renee's special: 1/2 turkey sandwhich, clam chowder and a salad.  It was perfect.  I had them put a ton of fresh ground pepper on my salad and soup.  Truthfully, I should have asked for tabasco for my soup (a little bland).  Other than that it was great. They let us sit and talk for hours (we had not seen each other in a long time) with no pressure since it was later in the afternoon.  I have been to a private party upstairs at this location before - which is a great option for a banquet or large gathering.  They  have a private bar and dining area upstairs.  Highly recommended!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=560
Tom M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",156,529,126,2.0,11/15/2012,"I really like their outdoor patio. But as the sun slowly sinks over the Redondo Harbor marina in the west, so sinks the quality of this place. Fascinatingly, as quality goes down, the portions seem to get even bigger.  Apparently, that's their business plan: big plates of uninspired food people can't finish. I know people see it as a value, but what's the value of bland leftovers in take-out containers drying out in your refrigerator? To be fair, there are some big protein items they do well with, such as a herb crusted Salmon. But otherwise, I just don't understand the attraction of their heaping bowls of enormous calories. I would rather have a standard portion and pay less! Which brings me to the ""light"" menu. Good on them for doing one. Bad on them for not understanding the concept. I had a 560 calorie meal of chicken breasts and tomatoes. But if I'm watching calories, why do I need THREE chicken breasts? One good quality breast would be welcome rather than the trio of dry, pounded, overcooked pieces I received.  Excessive is the rule at TCF, including the cheesecake (which does taste good). And while one piece for a family of 4 is plenty, why do you have to insult it with a mountain of spray whip cream? To make it look bigger than the calorie bomb it already is? To turn your liver to fois gras before the check arrives? Is there complimentary valet parking for paramedics? Attention America: we don't need this much food. The entire country of Brazil doesn't need this much food. And while the idea of leftovers obviously appeals to so many, there is a huge amount of food wasted at each and every outlet.  Personally, I find that more disgusting than any of their fat-laden menu items could ever be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=560

I took a group of close friends here for my daughter's 21st birthday on March 15th. this year. She had celebrated all weekend but this was her actual birthday.  I had called several weeks ahead and was told that they do not take reservations. Coming from the industry I am not sure how smart that is but I must say that one of the servers told me to ask for her and call that morning with the head count and they would be ready for us. They were! My friend and I got there early with balloons etc... had a drink and by the time we were done, we had the table set for our party window seat and all.  We had the best service, and the food is always great anyway. Some think it is a little over priced but with a party of 12 with a few extra salads and appetizers and a couple alcoholic drinks we still got out of there for under $300! This was the last of all the parties for her 21st  so I still wanted to make sure it was special but it didn't have to be the best one and it turned out feeling like we had paid double.

The cheesecake was delicious as always, although $17 for 2 slices of cheesecake seemed a bit steep. I have had cheesecake at Junior's in NYC and it was not that expensive and in my opinion it tasted better, but for the south bay this was very good.

Christa H.,"Lakewood, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/11/2013,"My review is on the service. I went there to celecbrate my father's birthday. When I arrived I told the host that I have a total of 8 people in my party but 2 of them won't be arriving until late. The guy told us that we could not sit down until at least half of our party was there. 3 of us were there. I informed his this was a bit of a 'surprise birthday' party and I would like to be seated so when the guest of honor arrived he would see us at the table already. So do you know what they offered to do. They offered to put my balloons down at the table but we could not sit down at the table until someone showed. How STUPID is that. Once again I explained that 2 people in our party would not be arriving until later so technically half of my party is here. NOPE...they made us wait until the guest of honor showed up and saw us in the lobby. But don't fret, the BALLOONS were sitting at the table.  Then we had a flighty waitress that we could never find. Had to ask about 3 other servers for assistance. This is the problem when you go out with large groups and they automatically charge gratuity. But guess what...YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE GRATUITY. You did not sign any contract that states that you will pay, all you have to pay is the bill. My attorney informed me of that.

Went for lunch the other day and was actually really surprised at how good it was.  Had the potstickers, the BLT salad and the fried chicken sliders.  All were great but the sliders were A-Mazing.  Very reminiscent of chick-fil-a.. As far as the parking goes - they kinda force you into valet but its only $2.50.  I thought I would be smart and park at a meter right  across the street.  To my dismay I came out to a $45 expired parking meter ticket.  Next time ill just let the dudes park my darn car.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=620

Jeannie L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",181,308,368,4.0,11/21/2013,"i love cheese cake factory.  I have been to a lot of different locations of cheesecake factory but i have to say that this location is my favorite.  It is located near the beach so you can enjoy the beautiful water view.  They have valet but I am not a big fan of valet especially paying $4.  Don't worry: there are plenty of street party right across the street.  It doesn't take credit card, so you just need to make sure you have enough coins though.   I think the foods were as good as other cheesecake factory stores.  and of course, you cannot miss their cheesecake!  The only complaint I have is that the waiter who served our table was very rude and I did not like his service at all.  I ordered miso salmon, one of my favorite dish at cheesecake factory, but it didn't come out even 10 minutes after everyone's orders come out.  We asked him about my order, and he just answered in a very rude tone ""It's coming!""  Few minutes later, one of managers came and apologized to us that the fish was burnt so they are re-doing it.  Since it took a long time, couple managers stopped by to apologize.  I am usually not too picky about the services but I do expect that waiter would have told us the same thing as managers did when we asked.  The manager complemented us by not charging us on miso salmon and a cheesecake that we ordered without us asking.  I really wanted to leave more tips for managers' services but since managers don't get to keep the tip, we did not leave as much as we would normally do to the waiter.  I appreciate their efforts to keep us satisfied with our experience there.  However, maybe they should keep closer eyes on their staff for service.

We were seated immediately, but at the very back of the restaurant, by the servery area- where the waiters ring up stuff, get extra utensils, etc. Not wanting to sit there, we asked to move outside. Again, she sat us at the very back, near the outside servery- swinging doors, kitchen noise all over again. And only one seat facing the water.The entire patio area was empty.  Our waiter arrived, and we asked to move again. he finally said, 'sit anywhere you wish'. So we picked a table in the middle of the patio, where it was quiet and we both had a nice view of the water. One of the servers (not our waiter) had an enormous amount of perfume on, which killed my appetite every time she walked by. Other than the seating arrangements and the heavy perfume, our waiter was stellar and the lemon ricotta pancakes were absolutely perfect. Still puzzled as to the seating choices when the entire place was empty.

I believe the only few times I had crap for service was when I ordered a salad dry and it came with everything on it and a verbal argument broke out as to what I said. Asking him to get his manager changed the situation and they took it off the bill (I just wanted a dry salad). The other time was when I had mold on my bagel and they tried to tell me to cut that part off. ""Oh Manager!,"" I said and that was comped and changed to something totaly different. Enough with the bad vibes. They have a great bar and you can order the entire menu there if you don't want to wait and a space is open. They have a ""skinny"" drink menu. Not sure you can get burboun any skinnier. But the drinks looked fun. When they are busy expect to wait or else go on off peak hours. The food is always good quality and you certainly get enough you just need to be with people that you enjoy being with and relax because if it's busy things there move at a moderate place.

But the beans, corn, avocado, and onion rings, made up for the lack of adequate dressing.  The pizzetta was amazing!  Fresh riccota cheese and flavorful sausage.  The vanilla bean cheesecake was, as usual, amaaaaaazing. But the slice that was served to us had an obvious thumb print on the edge of the slice. We alerted Dustin, who without complaint took back the thumbed cheesecake. He was apologetic, even though it wasn't his fault.

Patrice M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,5,,1.0,5/30/2012,"I wish I could give this location zero stars. I visited this location with my mother on 5/27/12. I figured it would be a great place to have my first alcoholic drink since I had turned 21 earlier this month. It started off good. We had a short wait time and a nice server.  But then our food took forever to come out. I ordered my usual - the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo.  At this point I still didn't have a problem. They were having difficulties in the kitchen and I wasn't starving, so it was fine. A manager came to check on us and I felt that was very nice of him. Later on I received my food which was great until I found a piece of hair in it. A PIECE OF HAIR IN MY FOOD! It was completely gross especially since I had eaten a good portion of the food.  It was a long thin strand buried down in my dish. I have never ever found hair in my food while eating at ANY Cheesecake Factory Restaurant.  I politely notified the server and he quickly took the plate away. Moments later a manager came and I asked me if I'd like anything else. I said I'd want my same dish to go. BIG MISTAKE. Of course my food ended up being complimentary but I received another surprise when I got home. I went to eat my food yesterday 5/29/12 and it was BURNT. I honestly could not believe it, it was like someone played a cruel joke on me. First, there's hair in my food then they send me home with a burnt meal.  I am very disappointed and disgusted at this Cheesecake Factory Location. From now on I'll ONLY go to the one in Glendale or the Grove. What's funny is that I started to ask the manager for a free drink instead of another meal and now I really wish I had of.

I was told they do not take reservations and it was suggested that I arrive an 1/2 an hour to 45 minutes before our planned dinner time to ensure we would be seated close to our planned 6 pm dinner time. I arrived an hour early. I was told we would be seated about 6:30. That didn't seem unreasonable.  Well...at 7:10, I had about lost my patience.  We were finally seated. We had two servers. Average service at best. One was actually indifferent. My husband's food came to the table about 15-20 minutes after everyone else was served. To top it off, he ordered a turkey burger and they brought him a ground beef burger. The manager comped his meal, which was nice. Bottom line...I'll never plan a big family dinner here in the future.

It was actually my new year's resolution one year to try every single cheesecake they had and what do you know, it was the only new year's resolution I have ever kept! My favorite cheesecake, white chocolate caramel latte, was actually gotten rid of, so my new favorites are pumpkin pecan, red velvet, or the tuxedo. You really can't go wrong with any cheesecake though, or any of their other cakes. (I love the Chocolate Truffle Cake the most) The food there rarely lets me down too. I've had most of their appetizers and my top picks are the fried macncheese balls, the avocado rolls, the spinach and cheese dip, the buffalo blasts, or the firecracker salmon rolls. Out of their pastas, I love the four-cheese pasta, the carbonara, or the farfalle with chicken and garlic. Their salads are amazing too, I usually never order salads when I go out because I never feel like its really that satisfying, but at the cheesecake factory, they are tasty enough as a meal and definitely fill me up, especially the BBQ chicken or the luau salad. Their burgers are always a solid choice too. The only things I've gotten there that I wouldnt get again are the fish and chips, which I thought were bland, and the belgium waffle, which was just like any other belgium waffle.  Anddd of course, I can't forget about the amazing bread they start you off with! Lets just say its a struggle for me to not fill up on the bread; got to have the bread...

I ordered a calamari appetizer which was OK as it did not come with any really good sauces but it was a decent size and was average.  My coworkers fish and meals seemed pretty decent but nothing special.  I ordered the Jamaican shrimp which had a nice sauce, fried plantains, mango salsa, and some rice and black beans.  I would suggest that you order it without cilantro as it ruined the meal.  If they only put a little cilantro on it the meal would have been OK, but my meal was ruined by the over use of it.  The mango salsa was good with the minute amount I received.  I got to try some Mahi-Mahi which was pretty good, but the meals are so big that dessert was not an option.  Next time I come here I will have to try a piece of the cheesecake.

Flavorful, just the way I ordered it (medium), bacon was great and those onion rings lol yea they were perfect. My brother and dad said the same about their food but I literally left my plate clean. The service was just as amazing, friendly staff, helpful and even though it was busy everyone kept calm and were communicating with each other the way it should be.

Henry Y.,"Carson, CA",99,141,60,5.0,8/21/2013,"""Come all those who are toiling and weighed down, and they will refresh you!"" This experience was magnificent!!! Where do I start??? The first paragraph will be a bit of background, for those of you who just want to get to the review then please skip to the second paragraph. For quite some time now  my Grandfather has been battling cancer and recently was in horrible condition. On the day  we went to visit this Cheesecake Factory location, my Grandfather had taken his last breaths earlier in the morning. My mother in a despondent state left work early, as my sister and I took her out for lunch to support and talk to her about our loss. We've recently just had his funeral in the city and state of Indianapolis, Indiana so please excuse the tardiness of this review, there has been a lot going on.             This place was very welcoming and our server was very nice. He gave us great attention, and answered all of our questions as many as there were. We would say ""I have a question"" and his reply was ""I have an answer!"" with a smile on his face. When our food arrived we were one plate short, wouldn't you know it, it was my mothers. Our server apologize, and then another server came over and apologize. The second server came with his chin up and said "" I don't know what (the first servers name) told you but it was completely my fault, I accidentally took his order and gave it to another customer. Once again I don't now what he told you but I take responsibility for my own mistakes. Is there anything I can do to make this situation right?"" With a bit of hesitation my mother asked for a slice of cheese cake. He said ""no problem I'll bring it right over."" The manager then comes over and inquires if everything is alright. At this time it was ""shock and aw"" the level of service provided. We spoke with her regarding the incident, and she added to the complete comfort and peace that we previously received from the two servers.               We enjoyed the rest of our delicious food and the cheese cake was brought out to my mother with excellent presentation. The manager came over one last time to make sure all was well and we thanked her for her loving-kindness and hospitality.                Although small, gestures like these make the big difference. My mother came in feeling horrible, and although time heals all, the excellent staff at the Cheese Cake Factory (having no idea of her mental state), definitely is credited for her initial upswing leading to emotional recovery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=640

I remember it used to be filled with goodness. nothing now.  Pizza was just bland. I know it is not a pizza place.  But I just used to have such good memories of this lunch.

Pascha S.,"Inglewood, CA",2,20,11,1.0,10/14/2014,"One of the worst experiences I've ever witnessed. On Friday 10/10/14 my husband and myself went to this Cheesecake Factory for dinner. But unfortunately we didn't have a chance to eat.. As we were waiting for our table, we saw a young couple walk in and an employee of the Cheesecake Factory stopped her in her tracks and told her, "" your guest are trying to eat without you. And continued to have a discussion with the young lady. I felt so bad for the lady who's party it was. It appeared that she was giving her husband a surprise party that her husband was unaware of because he said ""your guest, what guest"".  Shortly after this I see the redondo beach police coming up. I overheard the hostess tell them that people are up stairs smoking marijuana. The young lady came down and was talking to the police and she asked them to come up to her party to see for themselves that no one was do no such thing. When the officers came back down. The hostess said well they have the scent of marijuana on there clothes. To me this situation was not handled in a professional manner, the hostess seemed as if she was uncomfortable with the ethnicity group of this party. There was no outrageous behavior from the group up stairs nor did my husband, myself and a few other guest that we there waiting on a table smell any type of contraband being used in the facility. We were actually there long enough to see the party being asked to leave the establishment. The most upsetting thing to us was when we saw a gentleman (African American) and two young ladies being asked to leave also. They were not even a part of the party. They actually had a dinner table themselves. I really hate to say it, but it appeared this party had been racially profiled and discriminated on. During all this commotion my husband and myself missed the calling for our table, which was ok because we refused to dine at an establishment who conducts business this way... My apologies to the young lady who had to endure this hardship on what appeared to be a special day.

Their drinks are also off the charts good black iced tea, strawberry lemonade/ peach Bellini's, mojito's and margaritas.

Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",340,1543,221,4.0,7/18/2013,"I love The Cheesecake Factory and always have, but I didn't have the best experience at this one. We went on a weekend evening and were able to get a seat on the outdoor patio after only a couple minutes of waiting. That was a pleasant surprise, since they don't take reservations. Our service was pretty crappy. Our server was MIA, it took forever for him to bring out bread (even when we asked), and it just didn't seem very professional. The food was good, though, as it almost always is! I liked the outdoor patio here, but was annoyed by the heat lamps... It got chilly once the sun went down and an employee came around to light all the heat lamps. Luckily, I was sitting directly underneath one, so I was nice and toasty. During our meal, though, a woman at a neighboring table asked our server if he could turn off the heat lamp because it was ""such a lovely evening."" Without hesitation, the server turned off the heat lamp - even though I was sitting much closer to it than this other woman, right underneath it, and with a light jacket on - clearly I wasn't hot or uncomfortable. I was really annoyed that I wasn't even asked if I was okay with that decision they made. Anyway... I will always love the CF for the delicious food, epic proportions, humongous menu, and of course the cheesecake. I just hope the next time I go to this location I get a better server! Also, it was valet parking only so we parked across the street at a meter. For some reason, CF seems to be a fancier deal out here than it does on the east coast.

Melissa A.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",305,97,67,4.0,2/28/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory to being with, but this is my absolute FAVORITE location! The Patio seating is  wonderful, it's perfect during the day and provides a very imitate setting at night! Their Patio is situate on the harbor, the stunning view consist of docked boats, but you get the fresh ocean breeze and ocean sound.  The times I've gone there, we've only sat outside, the inside part of the restaurant is like any other Cheesecake Factory. It's beautiful during the day, and they provide umbrellas for coverage, on cold days or nights it's still special to sit outside and they have heaters strategically located.  Food there is fresh, delicious, flavorful and the dessert - REMARKABLE!!! I love their Cheesecake! They are so rich and creamy. I love have they have minimum two pages dedicated to all their many cheesecake selections! I have been guilty of skipping my meal to make sure I have room to indulge in a slice of cheesecake! They have a large menu which if you're not exactly sure what you're in the mood for can be a bit overwhelming. I've samples different item, I'm a huge fan of how they prepare their Salmon, their pastas are creamy and they have excellent salads. Their appetizers are just as good and definitely unique, when it's in season my favorite thing to get it the Fire Roasted Artichoke, I highly recommend it. I'm a fan of everything on their menu and as a very picky eater I am rather adventurous with my selections and to this day I haven't been displeased with anything.  This location has Valet parking, it's only $4, I'm not sure if they do allow public parking but for $4 you can't complain. The times I've gone here there hasn't been too long of a wait, I want to say the longest we've ever had to wait was about 10 minutes, but we were with a large party. As far as the service goes, I've received great service, good service and not the best service. The first few time I went was with a large party and the service was remarkable! My boyfriend took me there for dinner, again patio seating and the service was just as remarkable. However, this last time I was there the service was under standards. For a party of 5, our meals did not arrive altogether or relatively close, there was about 5-10 apart which made a big different with the menu it's that should have arrived hot. We constantly had to ask for items, like bread, and other tables that arrived after us had their orders taken before us.

Kyle D.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/13/2012,"I had to create a yelp account because I was so dissatisfied with what happened here today, on Mother's Day. To preamble, I am a bartender and I get it... But this was a laugh out loud joke. 1) It took 25 min to get all of our orders to the table (a table of 12)  at the same time. 1/4 of the plates were cold, and 1/4 of the orders weren't correct. Every kind of problem from the wrong toast, a small problem; or an omelette prepared incorrectly, large problem. Three of our dishes had to be remade because they were prepared far too early (according to the server). For a corporate chain who prides themselves on superb service, this was rough, my brother (30) and dad (68) who have a good stress tolerance were 100% hangry.  2) The expo had attitude with my father when he said, ""this isn't what I ordered."" I understand that if a customer is dissatisfied and it's not your direct fault you still should not snap back. 3) The restaurant was at 1/2 capacity! We had brunch at 9:45 am! Get it together cheesecake! 4) When the disaster became official, 5 expos flooded our table with apologies, correct sides, the extra avocado and piping hot food that was 25 minutes late. No manager showed up, which to me, a bartender was rude. My girlfriend and I chose to eat our food warm-ish because we didn't want to deal with the fiasco at hand (but as before a yelp was needed) The server was a sweetheart and quoted every order that was prepared incorrectly from memory, totally not her fault. The back of the house needs to lock it up and figure it out. The expos should smile more and roll their eyes less. I'm sure the server was glad she could auto-grat the table due to the headache that was my cheesecake experience. Thanks for the Happy Mother's Day! My boss owner of multiple restaurants raves about this place and I was 100% disappointed. I will have a talk with him.    Worst, Cheesecake Chain, Ever...

Hello K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,160,3,3.0,4/5/2013,"Over the years this place has gone downhill from what it used to be. The food is just not as tasty as it once was. The service is ridiculous. On my last visit the waitress was trying to hurry us and kept trying to take our bread basket away from us (there was still bread in it!) I had ordered a cobb salad with the blue cheese crumbles on the side. After waiting awhile like usual a different person (not my waitress) brings me a salad and walked away. I notice that it has the blue cheese crumbles mixed in the salad so I have to wait for him to walk by again. So I get his attention and said I ordered it with the blue cheese on the side. He said ""Oh OK i understand"" and takes that salad away. He comes back a third time and hands me a salad that still has the blue cheese crumbles in it but no dressing, he put the dressing on the side. I really don't understand how difficult that could have been but my friend had to start eating her food before I got my correct order because hers would have gotten cold. Even while eating our dinners the waitress kept trying to take our dang bread basket - what the heck was that all about?! I felt like I had to fight for my bread! Then there was the ever so annoying switch of the waitresses because someone is going on break or leaving (who gets the tip from our table anyways?) The chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake is made with a giant lump of cookie dough in the center of the entire cheesecake. So when you get a slice it's like regular cheesecake with a tiny bit of cookie dough at the end. Lamest cheesecake I have experienced there. They should disperse little cookie dough balls throughout the entire cheesecake mix so you get some in every bite. And this place is just way too noisy to have any kind of conversation and the sun coming through the windows will burn your retinas. I recommend coming here after dark and maybe trying to sit in the bar area if it's less crowded.  Next time I go I might have to keep one hand on my fork and my other hand with my death grip on the bread basket!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=660

They do have a great banquets/catering department and they execute events really well. Also, sometimes you can self-park to the right when you pull in to avoid the hideous valet at $2.50 for lunch and I think $4 for dinner?

Long story: Food was average was service was TERRIBLE.  I was appalled by the lack of respect I was shown because of my age.  I am a young man and I have been a server for years and still work in the restaurant industry.  I tip well because I know how stressful this job can be, but treating a customer like I was treated today is never okay.  My friend and I sat in the bar area because the wait was long and we just thought we'd grab drinks and dinner really quick.  We get to the bar and was never greeted by a server and after about 5 mins a lady asked if we had our drink orders taken yet and I told her no, but we'll have 2 waters for the moment (my friend was in the bathroom and I didn't know what she wanted).  We waited close to 40 Minuets before we got any order put in.  This is after trying to flag down the wait staff and also trying to order at the bar, but we weren't allowed to if we weren't drinking at the bar counter.  The male server in the bar section was ASSIGNED to our table because the 2 of them fought over which one had to take us.  He NEVER came over!  I would mad dog him and he would look right at me and walk past me and my friend and take drink and food orders of the newly sat people all around me.  5 parties that had come in after had drinks and apps before my drink order was even put in.  There is no excuse to that.  Finally my friend stood up and went to the female waiter and told her we're still waiting to get helper and she was a bit snippy with us.  I told her we'd been waiting for 40 mins to put in our order and she promptly says ""well you do know this isn't the dining area.""  Seriously?  Yeah that happened.  This point we don't STILL don't have drinks.  Why does it take 40 mins to get our drink order.  That same server dropped off our drinks and offered us a complementary chicken soup because of the wait.  We said yes and thank you.  She never came back to check up on us and the soup never came.  That is just insult to injury.  They brought over a 3rd server and besides refilling water we were the ONLY table she was waiting on.  The other 2 were such big pricks that they had to bring in a 3rd server because they didn't want to deal with the young couple.  We talked to the manager, who turned out to be the lady who brought us water, and we told her how we felt like we were being ignored because of our age.  She kept trying to assure us that wasn't the case and how the guy thought we'd been taken care of and we didn't need anything, but that was obviously a lie.  He has NO place working in the restaurant industry if he thinks a table with menus, waving there hands, staring him down, asking for help, and empty water cups is okay and doesn't need to be helped.  If you get a new table, no matter what, you go over and introduce yourself to let them know you'll be taking over and ask if they need anything.  He never came over to apologize.  The 3rd server was actually very nice to us and was left a decent tip. I will never come back here.  I never cared for this place before, but that has now turned into a deep distaste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=660

Rachel R.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",54,73,8,4.0,10/13/2014,"Although this is a chain restaurant, it's one of the best. This location has a spectacular view and has an upper banquet area for renting out for parties. The food is delicious, and the portions are generous, I always take half home with me. The one downside is their menu is huge, making it hard to choose what you want to order. If you are having drinks with friends and don't want to order a huge meal, they have a small plates menu to choose from that is about half or 1/3 the size of their normal appetizer portions. The service is almost always great, even when they are crowded and have a 40 minute wait. If you come towards the end of the night as it slows down, I've found its a little harder to get my server to come to my table and end up waiting a bit. A tip if you are with a small group of 2-3 people and their is a long wait, check the bar, usually their are seats open or seats that open up and you can order the full food menu at the bar. The cheesecake of course is delicious, and I've had almost every item on their cheesecake menu. I would have to recommend the red velvet cheesecake as my all time favorite.

The Pizzas were average and we ate them, but were not worth what I was charged for them.  I must say I am totally disappointed, I should have just ordered a cheesecake.    PS.  The Restaurant is lovely and the people I interacted with were polite and gave good service, my issues are with the lunch time meal I was given.  8-12-14  I am updating this review.

Eddie C.,"Torrance, CA",196,42,,4.0,9/28/2010,"My visit to the Cheescake Factory was very enjoyable. I don't go there often, but when I do I try and enjoy it as much as I can. :) When I went, I asked the hostess for a window seat. The view of the dock, boats and water were wonderful, I got to enjoy the nice ocean view while I was there enjoying a meal. If you've never been there, its really worth trying out (ask for a window seat). The menu has pretty much everything so you can try with whatever cravings you have. I ordered the wild mushroom burger. The food was good and portion is decent, not too big but its fitting so I don't over eat. Overall dinner was nice, but the really good part is when I tried the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. That cheesecake is delicious, not too overly sweet, the center was rich and creamy just perfect I think. Its worth trying out. If your not much a chocolate fan, this is something you should try. Hey! its Godiva Chocolate, how can it taste bad. :p Anywho, this place is great! :)  The food, servers, the atmosphere and the view of the harbor was great. Can't complain about anything in there. Only thing I didn't like was the parking that they have. Self parking has very limited spaces, because practically the whole lot is for  valet parking only. I parked across the street with the meter parking, cost me a few quarters, still not bad.

Michael W.,"Wellington, FL",4,5,,1.0,7/14/2012,"Poor experience in Redondo Beach, CA  It started with the hostess getting my name wrong. Typed in Mile instead of Mike. Not a big deal, but had to include it in my overall experience. We sat down and the waiter took a long time to get to us. When he finally did, he took our drink orders and when we inquired about some bread he said that they ran out an needed to make more. Understandable except that there were other tables who sat after us and they were served bread upon seating. We were told that the last of the bread went to the other table. We would have to wait.  We then ordered main courses and waited appox. 45 minutes until our waiter came over to the table and said that he had to talk to the manager about why our food was taking so long. Nice to get the manager involved when he could have come to us first. He then said that the kids meal was holding up our order. Huh? I've never heard of 2 sliders holding up 3 full sized meals. In any case, a different server came out and gave us 2 of our 4 meals. We didn't want to eat without the other meals arriving, and they should have kept the two in the back until the others were ready. Abiut 10 minutes later, the manager comes over with our other 2 meals. 1 of the other 2 was the wrong order. She got a Chicken Madiera instead of what she ordered, a Chicken Marsala. Again, not terrible as that could be an honest mistake. So we waited for another order to be cooked and in the meantime, my Memphis Burger I had found to be raw when I ordered it medium. I had to send it back and requested a new one. The manager brought the new order of Chicken Marsala and I waited and waited for the new burger to come out. 10 minutes later it finally came out, a piece of cheddar cheese was slapped onto it, not even melted as it should have been. Now I was finally ready to eat. Undercooked again. So I told them to just take it away since I was done trying to get a proper order completed.  Then the waiter came to the table with a new waitress and said that she will take care of us from now on since her wanted to go on a break. What does she do? Left me the check! Nobody asked us if we wanted dessert, which we did. We all wanted a piece of cheesecake since I was in town from Phoenix and this was our vacation so we were going to splurge a bit. We all could notnbelieve that they just wanted us out of there.  ****UPDATE**** Well, it seems as the only person who actually did get their meal correctly, may have contracted food poisoning that evening. Breakfast was eaten at home (pancakes and coffee) and popcorn at the movie theater. Nothing else but dinner (obviously no dessert since we weren't offered), and the symptoms began within about 3 hours after eating dinner. ***************** When I go to Cheesecake Factory, I expect the same service and quality of food at each restaurant I visit.

Chris Y.,"Lawndale, CA",64,282,36,4.0,12/9/2010,"It's always a treat to visit the Cheesecake Factory. This particular location is nice since it's near the ocean & the pier. The decor is very bright & clean. It's usually busy during dinner and the wait time usually deters me from eating here more often. But the select occasions when I have dined here, I've always been pleased with both the food & the service overall. The menu has a large selection of dishes. However, reading the menu is almost like picking up a novel. It can be tricky to read & navigate. (I must remember to bring my bookmark next time) Just like the wait times to be seated, the wait time to get your food after you've placed your order can be a bit long, but they give you some delicious bread & butter to tide you over in the meantime. Portions are usually large. I've never left hungry. The cheesecake is, of course, phenomenal! But the name ""Cheesecake Factory"", you'd expect no less. They have more kinds of a cheesecake than you can shake a stick at. And the slice they bring you is very large. I always feel like I'm about to slip into a diabetic coma after I'm finished. I used to think the prices were expensive, but after taking a look at most decent restaurants these days, Cheesecake Factory is about on par with the rest. Service has always been fantastic. Very courteous and professional. Not always the best when it comes to attentiveness, but it's understandable considering how many people they have to wait on. In addition to their large dining room & patio area, their second story can be accessed by stairway and leads to more private dining halls/sections, complete with a full bar and views of the marina. Perfect for private gathering or company banquet. Parking is done by valet, unless you can find a spot along the street or in the adjacent lots.

Lydia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/9/2014,"Went there last night to celebrate a birthday, chose this location because of the view and the last time there with a large party service was Great!! This time not so much.  Once seated our party of 11 was given 1 basket of bread. After 3 requests finally received water. We were told by our server that the order will be taken in order so it can be delivered that way.NOT THE CASE!!! Meals were  delivered in randomly with 2 meals not being delivered.. Then 15 20 minutes later after speaking to a manager the final 2 entrees were delivered but one order meatloaf had to be returned because it was burned so bad you could not eat it. Then of everyone else's food got cold because we were waiting for everyone to have their meal...

It was my little sisters birthday and my mom and I wanted to do something special for her. We drove there and I thought okay Redondo beach ,good location.  We were seated immediately which is rare! Our Server was named Ryan and at first we thought he was friendly. Okay that  was a thought. He failed to cater to us as well as he did to other tables. We told him it was my sisters birthday and he told us the policy was if you buy a cake, they wrote the name in chocolate and sing. If you don't buy a cake, they give you ice cream and sing. Well we didn't buy a cake and bruh no ice cream! So leaving he took forever to give us a bill and take it. I think I might not go back to cheesecake factory. Not worth it.

Marc B.,"Long Beach, CA",40,38,5,4.0,12/12/2010,"CHEESECAKE FACTORY - always a good place to taste. For this specific cheescake factory, I must say that the parking is HORR-I-BLE. The horrible parking is due to the fact that the restaurant is located next to Redondo Beach's King Harbor - and in LA there is no such thing as good parking next to the beach (without paying for it in some form). The view once inside is very nice and the wait area is super tiny. So plan accordingly.  Try to get next to the window to look out at all the nice boats parked in the harbor. Even if you don't get a window seat, the menu is to die for (as it is at all the cheesecake factories). Since it was lunch and I was craving basic seafood, I chose shrimp and fries (pretty basic for cheescake) and my girlfriend chose Hibachi Steak and mashed potatoes with asparagus (excellent choice by the way). They have so much on the menu (a fat man in hell could not eat his way out of it), that you might as well try something that sounds good if you've never heard of it. They also have wide selection of drinks that are really good, but on this occasion I did not try.  But let's be honest, who is there for the main course? It's the CHEESECAKE factory, I came for the damn cheesecake. I got a reese's pieces chocolate cheesecake (seasonal on the menu) - turned out to be uber delicious for those peanut butter fans reading  (highly recommended). But I was so stuffed by the end I needed to take it home - shout out the our waiter Julio who did a good job.

But somehow, the one in Columbus, OH that I went to was possibly less and the food tasted better... Anyway, I got the Ceasar's Salad..but either the raw garlic in the dressing gave me heartburn or something...it tasted more like horseradish--the feeling when eating it straight. I got the Filet Mignon...medium, but charred...I don't they'll ever make my steak the way I want it AND they ALWAYS forget my steak knife, as I keep on asking for one after they bring my entree.  Moreover, I didn't realize my Filet Mignon dinner conly comes with the mean on a oval plate and a basket of friends with 3 onion rings...pretty ugly presentation...maybe they missed something? The Spaghetti with meat sauce was ok...but lay off on the black peppers cooks! The cheesecake!  This hasn't changed--decent taste.  I think I choose the more plain types of cheesecake as the others are just WAAAY to sweet and make you feel like you'll be diabetic. I gave two stars for the hostess and the lady manager for that area, as they failed at their job. My server was ok, but the bread came out way too late...waaay too late...I disliked my water in a plastic beer mug. Will probably go back for some cheese cake, but not too much for the food.

Our waitress was very nice even though she did seem busy. I ordered a Cosmo and my husband, an old fashioned. My Cosmo was very good but my husband said his drink was mainly ice and a waste of money. The food was good but my main complaint for this visit is that whoever was on dish duty in the back of the house was not washing the dishes well at all. My sons plate had food stuck on his plate and my water had a nasty brown smudge all on the inside of my glass!

Denise S.,"Torrance, CA",0,19,,4.0,5/29/2013,"Went on 5/27 for a graduation dinner. Angela, sorry you had such a bad experience as we were there the same night.  I guess it really does depend on the server.  I was a little skeptical about going here after reading the less than great reviews.  I wonder if managers/owners have been reading Yelp comments (they should every day!), as the more recents reviews seem a little more favorable.  We had a very nice dinner.  I wanted to go early, being it was a holiday, wasn't sure how busy they would be.  Got there around 5:15 and was seated right away.  I believe our server's name was Summer, and she did a great job.  By 6:00 it was filling up fast. She was attentive, friendly and on top of things.  We had the chicken piccata, steak sandwich, and my friend's pasta dish (which I can't remember which one.)  All were very good.  I don't go here very often but will be back. The only comment I have is that when you pull in, on the right is a small parking lot with maybe 15-20(?) spaces, which is not valet. Park yourself if you want.  There were several spaces empty. When we pulled up the attendant opened the door and my son said he was going to park in the self park, he gave my son a dirty look and walked away.  Ok, $4.00 is great for valet, but I don't like waiting for my car to be retrieved and there was a space right up front so why not?  The way they have it set up, it looks like you HAVE to valet park. Just stay in the right lane and see if there are any spots open.  If not, the attendants work both lanes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=720

Don N.,"Pasadena, CA",549,188,83,3.0,12/28/2011,"I really wanted to like this cheesecake factory, but I don't care too much for it. This is partly my own fault because I was passive and didn't ask for what I wanted.  Quick and Dirty: Parking: -2 stars, they'll try to trick you into valeting your car, but you can self park Location: 5 stars, beautiful right next to the water, but make sure you ask for seating next to the windows if you want them, especially if you look young.  Food: 3 stars, It isn't gourmet, except for their sauces. Once you run out of sauce, good luck finishing the big portions.  Wine: Raven's Wood Zin was good for its price.  Service: 3.5 stars, pretty decent. Attentive enough. Overall: 3 stars. I wouldn't really come back here except that it does have a nice atmosphere... that said, there are also other places on the water that I'd rather check out instead.  Longer than needed review: Parking:  Negative 2 stars. When you enter the lot, you see a valet sign with a service price. If I hadn't checked online and with yelp, I would have been conned into paying them $3.50 or so + tip to park my car like 20 feet away... instead I asked about the self-park lot... which is directly to the right of the valet sign. The problem is is that this lot is minuscule compared to the valet lot, which probably can accommodate more cars than the restaurant can diners. When we were leaving we saw a car or two lined up for the self-park lot.. so I guess I'd recommend coming a little earlier if you want to self-park. I think you can probably ask the valet if you can self-park on the valet lot side if the lot on the right side is full and/or just pay them the $3.50 because I guess it is a ritzier location.   Location:  It is right on the water so it is a pretty nice location = 5 stars Seating:  2 stars When we came they didn't seem too busy. We asked for a table for two and were seated immediately on the upper level next to the wall, still within view of the windows, but weren't really able to see out of them being as it was night (it is harder to see out at night when inside is brighter) and there were diners inbetween. I was kind of hoping for a seat closer to the windows but I was preoccupied and didn't ask.. figuring that all the seat near the windows were already taken... I was mistaken. About three minutes after we were seated I saw the hostess lead an older couple to a sear near the window. Lesson for me: Ask to be seated near the window. What the hostess could/should have done: Ask our preference and/or let us know there were seats near the window. My thoughts: She probably saw that we were young and figured we wouldn't spend/tip as much as older folks... I spent and tipped plenty, thank you.  Food:  Sauce (5 stars), Portions (3.5 stars), Once you run out of sauce (2 stars)   I've come to the conclusion that the cheesecake factory food is pretty sub-par but they have definitely mastered their sauces and give you a fair portion - we barely made a dent in our mashed potatoes. They don't seem to marinate anything, i.e. once you run out of sauce you better ask for some salt, pepper, lemon, and hot sauce. My friend and I both ordered combos. My friend ordered a Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon. I ordered the Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira. They Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon were decent. The chicken madeira was bland even with all the cheese on top. The lemon sauce on the salmon was really truly freaking delicious. We ended the meal with a white chocolate raspberry truffle cheese cake. The presentation of the cheesecake was pretty... they sure used a ton of whip cream to get there so great for all your whip cream lovers.  Waiter: Our first waiter I guess was breaking somebody and was really nice. He recommend a raven's wood zin to go with our steaks. We ordered one glass of that and a glass of the house merlot just to test out. I'd recommend going with the zin. The second waiter was okay; he'd come around ever once in a while but I definitely liked the first guy better - hope he got tipped out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=740

Nancy M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/3/2014,"My experience at this Cheesecake Factory maybe the worst I have ever had at a restaurant.  We waited a rather ling time for attention, ( I never saw her at more than 4 tables) finally our waitress came for our drink order my husband ordered a bottle of Champagne and the the waitress ask me what I wanted to drink - duh.  We could have given our order at that time - our menus clearly closed and waiting, but no such luck.  She returned with our not very cold Champagne, still did not take our order.  She returned a bit later and took our order.  I ordered the crab benedict with 'soft' eggs.  When our meal finally showed up it was covered in scrambled eggs - a word I never said, poached eggs, which the dish comes with are boiled - duh soft boiled eggs.  I sent the dish back. At least 10 maybe 15 minutes (while my husband eating his meal) later it she brought my meal with poached eggs.  Well it was not very good.  The was very little Hollindaise Sauce or crab for that matter, the poached eggs were not soft, and the dish itself was was not that great since it was 75% potato, I would add that the side offered was more potatoes or tomatoes I choose tomatoes and here it's the middle of Summer and they were tasteless.  Yes the manager came over to apologize but I didn't 'feel it'.  When my husband said I want to take home the chicken littles and nothing else, he was brought  a container.  But after he put them in and the waitress came back she did not even bother to remove his plates.  Not until he after he got his B&B and Cappuccino did she pick up the plate.  I ordered a low carb cheesecake to go, with strawberries, I decided on takeout because I could not stand to be there any longer. When I looked at what I brought home I was incredibly disappointed, the piece of cheesecake was half the size I remember from previous experiences.  The amount strawberries is chintzy as is the amount of whipped cream, I say this because my husband and I had our Wedding Reception there 23 years ago on Monday. Which was a very lovely experience.  This negative review was both a poorly trained sever and Cheesecake Factory greed.  I have longed love going to CF but now I have to wonder if I will ever go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=740
Jay S.,"Irvine, CA",21,88,17,3.0,6/10/2009,"This restaurant is the perfect place to go if you're taking a big group of people who have different tastes. The menu is practically a book unto itself, and includes america, asian, and mexican cuisines, among others. I usually order the spicy cashew chicken for its bold, slightly spicy flavor. And the portions of all their food are more than enough to satisfy anyone's hunger.  With regard to service,  most waiters are just average. There are a few who go above and beyond (i can't remember their names) by giving refills without asking, making sure that things are going okay, showing great knowledge of the dishes in the menu, etc.  The main problem here is that, for some reason, the cooks often have problems forgetting to properly customize an order; for example, by forgetting to not-put-bacon on the dishes.  I have a friend who often orders the chicken and avocado club sandwich, but without the bacon. On many occasion (ie more than 6), they always leave the bacon on the sandwich, forcing her to send it back to make a new one--even though she told the waiter repeatedly to write down no bacon on the order sheet. Although this is a problem with the cooks, it nonetheless happens often. Management, however, does a good job of fixing the problem and usually compensates for the mistake by providing free cheesecake or by refunding the cost of the sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=740
Vynetta R.,"Honolulu, HI",198,98,45,1.0,6/10/2013,"This location was horrible. Let me begin with arriving in the parking lot. The valet told us it is mandatory parking and there was no open public parking. It was $4. They forced us to  use valet service. Not to mention there is no ATM on site. We walked in the restaurant and it was out of control loud. The servers were yelling, the hostess looked confused and the manager didn't seem to have a grip on her employees, we were seated near the window which was nice. The waiter was nice however he was confused about the menu. The utensils provided were dirty. The menus that were given to us were also dirty. As I got the looking around, under the table was dirty. Like all they did was wipe the table :( the dish I ordered was the BBQ PUlled Pork Sandwich which comes with fries and a salad on the side, the pulled pork sandwich was not shredded meat but more like chunks of meat thrown in the sandwich. The sweet potatoe fries were delicious and fresh. The Salad didn't arrive until 25min later. The waiter brought me a cole slaw salad and not what was described on the menu. The drink I ordered was a Passion Mojito. No alcohol what so ever. I will not go back to this Cheesecake Factory location.

Elena S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,21,48,5.0,12/12/2009,We had our wedding reception here.  We rented the entire floor.  The service was amazing.  The food was incredible. The banquet managers were top notch. Overall if I had to do it again I would in a heart beat.  We were able to have a mariachi there and a dj.  They took care of all my needs and made it look incredible.  Our guest were impressed with their attention to detail.  We had cheesecake for our dessert and a chocolate fountain to go along with it.  I would recommend this restaurant not only for an everyday event but for special occasion too.  We had servers walking around and cleaning up as things went along.  The bar tender were great.  It has private bathrooms and you can use the elevator. We had 120 guest and they all fit comfortably.  We had a dance floor and we did all the traditional stuff.  They accommodated our vegetarian guests although we ordered chicken and salmon for our entrees.  They served the kids meals for the children.  The amount they charge is a set amount for the room and you can distribute it what ever way you want.   They set up our tables and everything from the guestbook to the flower pedals on the bar area.  They are professional and extremely organized.  They kept to the timeline I gave them and made sure our guest were taken care of. For all the things they did for us we have to THANK them.  They were amazing and I would recommend it to anyone having a wedding. They took so much stress out of my life.       If you would like more information please ask. * All photo I uploaded taken by Studio 7 Photography,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=740

Kathy W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",213,545,113,3.0,3/11/2012,"I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory location since it opened over 20 years ago.  I am now beginning to think that whoever manages this restaurant has their head up their butt.  A friend is one of the servers, and he tells me the exact same thing.  For example, a server will get FIVE TABLES all at once!  How in the heck are you supposed to keep all of them happy?  Someone's going to be feeling neglected here.  But, I digress.  Three friends and I showed up this afternoon for lunch and were seated outside almost immediately, which is great as we were expecting a wait on such a beautiful day.  A server comes by and takes our drink order.  Then he comes back with another server and tells us that this guy will now be our server.  Whatever.  Another person passes right by our table to bring two of our drinks to another table, meaning we had to flag them down.  The other two drinks arrive by yet another person who again passes right by our table to deliver them to another table, so again we have to flag them down.  We finally order.  Our bread takes forever; only when we ask are we told that it's in the oven.  Fine; this means the bread will be fresh.  Two of our entrees arrive; the food runner goes right past us to another table.  He tells us that he was given the wrong table number.  I asked for the avocado in my salad to be on the side, and the kitchen interpreted this as *extra* avocado *in* the salad, so it had to go back.  Anyway, it is apparent that there is utter chaos in this facility, on this day at least.  On the positive side, the food and atmosphere were great.  We all enjoyed what we ordered, and we split a slice of absolutely fabulous mango key lime cheesecake that had this to-die-for coconut macaroon crust.  I just wish they could get the rest of their act together, then they would deserve more stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=740

Anyhoo...had dinner at the Redondo Beach location with my two boys.    We had a gorgeous view of the marina from our table with the sun setting in the background.  Hubby ordered the prime rib and I had the garlic noodles with chicken, which I shared with baby.  Hubby enjoyed his rib, but my noodles had a little too much sauce.  So I used the sourdough bread to mop up some of the excess. Our server, Joel, took really good care of us.  While we were waiting for our order, baby was hungry but didn't want the snacks we had for him.  So Joel brought him his own plate of bread and sliced bananas, and baby was really happy.  What service! Now as for dessert (which we didn't have) here's what I would've selected:   Cheesecake: Key Lime, Snickers Bar or Peanut Butter & Chocolate Other: Carrot cake or strawberry shortcake I'm feeling bloated just thinking about these treats.  But I know that Cheesecake Factory will have them ready for me when I return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=800

Of course the free bread is good, always plentiful. The best appetizer has to be the FRIED MACARONI CHEESE BALLS, if you have a chance i really recommend this! Who else has macaroni cheese in balls? It tastes really cheesy and the creamy marinara sauce goes very well! I've only really had pasta's over here and i have two favorites the Pasta Da Vinci and the Fettucini with Chicken and Sundried Tomatoes. I've never had a problem over here! And of course i have to talk about the cheesecake, my favorite has got to be the Chocolate Tuxedo, its more creamy and less chocolatey than other chocolate cheesecakes i've tried. it tastes even better with the whipped cream!

Ts W.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,9,13,2.0,7/2/2013,"We went to cheesecake factory in Redondo Beach with a group of 10 to celebrate our friends birthday on June 30th at around 8:30 pm. Our experience was by far one of the worst we have ever experienced there. Our server didn't seem very attentive to us, and took excessive amounts of time to not only take, and bring out our orders, but to also get our checks. We notified the staff that it was our friends birthday, and we were under the impression that the ""birthday cake"" brought out was supposed to be complimentary, however we were charged $7.50. (To be fair we did order a slice of cheesecake, but it was NOT intended to be for the birthday boy). We assumed they would bring something separate for him.   Our bill came out to be around $225 with added gratuity of around $31 dollars. We distinctively remember giving $188 in CASH, (This is accurate because 3 of us at the table counted the money at three completely separate times) leaving the unpaid balance of $47 to be split onto 3 credit cards. $47 split into 3 is $15.66. However each Individual Bill came out to be about $20. This simply cannot be. When we confronted our waiter and asked him how much cash we gave him, he said $168.00, which is impossible. He showed us the money, and we noticed that he only had 4 $20 bills in his hand. We KNOW FOR A FACT that there were 5 $20 bills when we handed it to him. The only explanation we can think of is that our server, put $20 into his pocket. We had no way of proving this at the time, and we were EXTREMELY annoyed at how long the entire payment process took (about 30 minutes AFTER WE GAVE OUR CREDIT CARDS AND CASH) so we didn't want to cause a scene and left. Needless to say we will NEVER be eating at your restaurant or any of your other locations EVER AGAIN. This is unacceptable, and you can expect to see this review posted on not only Yelp, but Facebook and any other social media link you guys have, so that it never happens to another customer again.

H M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",103,7,1,5.0,7/3/2011,"Hello, I wanted to email the coordinator of this restaurant in Redondo Beach. I was a Wedding Coordinator for a wedding at this location on June 25th.  I have worked at some of the top venues in Southern California and it is very rare that I have the pleasure of working with someone as professional as Lauren (I hope I have her name right, she did not have business cards).  When I arrived at the venue at the beginning of cocktail hour Lauren and her attentive staff had the room completely set with every detail the bride had requested. I knew that the bride had moved up her reception time, giving the venue only one hour between an earlier event, but there was no evidence of an earlier party. Lauren was very detailed and went over every aspect of the room set up with me. She then compared my timeline with hers and checked that we had the same schedules. She also verified her timeline with the photographers and DJ. She was extremely efficient and genuinely cares about all aspects of the event. The entire evening all I had to do was look up, and Lauren was there asking me if there was anything I needed. I barely had to suggest dimming the lighting, or adjusting the cake serving time and Lauren was already working on it.  I would just like to commend Lauren for a going above and beyond to make the experience at her venue perfect. She is very qualified and puts many coordinators to shame. I would highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory Redondo Beach for future events.

Paul L.,"Irvine, CA",729,418,1098,2.0,10/26/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory just blows. Now, in saying this, I realize that I have just dissed the sacred cow of dinner date/celebration restaurants, but I cannot hold back any more. I am literally busting at the gut to let it out: the place just blows ass. For one thing, who puts ads in menus? Isn't it enough that I am about to order a tub full of food? Do I really need to be shopping for a new pool while I am at it? I guess they figure that I will need a bigger one after this meal is over. And another thing, while I personally have no problem with high concept fusion cuisine, I do have a problem with dishes that think ""fusion"" simply means a whole helluva lot of food. And what's the deal with their Thai dishes anyway? What's so Thai about the addition of carrots and peanuts? I lived in Thailand for months and never ate a carrot nor peanuts, much less together. Tonight, Joy and I popped into our local Factory to satisfy a sweet tooth we were both having. Just a little somethin' somethin' to put the day to bed. Had I known that I would still be burping 4 hours later, I would never have entered the joint. So we order the Mud Pie, a sickening combination of chocolate cake, two kinds of ice cream, hot fudge, all covered by a duvet of whipped cream. Sounds pretty good at first, eh? To be honest, it is very good.  But when you get to your twelfth spoonful and you're still not even past the first layer of cream and frosting, you start to get images of your dentist going CHA CHING! Out of frustration, we decide to eviscerate the poor sucker, just to get at some of the cake -- you know, the stuff you are actually paying for. I guess that behavior comes from my Chinese mother, who would always tell me to finish the most expensive part of a dish whenever I started to get full: ""Mom, I'm can't eat any more!"" ""Just eat the meat then, "" she would respond. After ten more mouthfuls, and two more cups of coffee, I am on the verge of exploding -- literally. My body has started to reject all the sugar I have ingested, and the coffee isn't helping any either. A quick trip to the bathroom and I have just flushed $6.95 + tax down the john. Unfortunately, I do not feel any better afterward. For all this, I blame The Cheesecake Factory. I mean, who serves a piece of cake the size of Joyce's Ulysses? Do they really expect people to eat so much food? Of course, I did not have to finish my Mud Pie, but the fact is, I tried. Am I another victim of the chubbification of America? Or is this just another example of the failures of US liberal democracy? We often perceive of America as a land of plenty, a place where freedom and opportunity abounds. If The Cheesecake Factory is emblematic of this kind of plenty, then why does it result in such excesses? We are often socialized to think that bigger is better, that more is merrier, that consumption is a sign of strength: this is an ideology that crosses over into every realm of our lives. But it is this unbridled hunger for consumer goods that is producing sweatshops in the third world, levelling rainforests at a lightning pace, and leading us into war with Iraq. We are on the verge of firing smart missles at the Middle East, all because I had a fuckin' sweet tooth. So how did I get from The Cheesecake Factory to the war in Iraq? I don't know; I blame the sugar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=800

Was told it was going to be slow on a tuesday night, seemed pretty busy to me. We got seated quite promptly and proceeded to order the avocado egg-rolls appetizer cuz those are sooo good! (good fat too right!)  Once again, the cheesecake factory menu managed to confuse me with way too many choices and of course i took forever to choose. The specials menu didn't seem special so and i couldnt decide what to get either so found the combination section and chose the grilled salmon and beef medallions with rich mushroom sauce. It was good, although it seemed like the sauce of the salmon didn't match too well with the mushroom sauce of the beef. It doesn't matter, the red velvet cheesecake was waiting in the wings and its as good an end of the meal as the egg-rolls are at the start of the meal.  p.s. - its a 15 min walk to the pier, seems like there's sufficient parking next to it if you just wanna drive there.

This menu is jam packed full of all kinds of different foods.  There really is something for everyone.  We always order an appetizer because they have so many good ones.  The artichokes are a good starting point.  One of my favorite dishes they have is the Herb Crusted Salmon.  It's cooked perfectly aside some amazing mashed potatoes.  My girlfriends favorite dish is the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic.  I really haven't had something that I didn't like off their menu.  Last but not least, get the cheese cake.  Try anyone because they are all good!!

Two of my favorite dishes are the shrimp angel-hair pasta and the chicken ceasar salad. The food is just so tasty and the portions are large, so I always walk out with leftovers.  Of course, you can't end the night without trying one of their cheesecakes! Being the old school person that I am, I always order their classic cheesecake (with strawberry topping). This is probably what I'm looking forward to the most. Creamy and oh so tasty! Service here is great. Staff is very nice and always check on you every 5 minutes.

Melisa K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,1,,1.0,5/9/2011,"My  family and I went to the Redondo Beach location for Mother's Day dinner. Our first mistake was going to the Cheesecake Factory on such a busy day, and our second was actually waiting over an hour and a half to be seated. Nonetheless we waited and we ate, but it was the worst experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. I am a regular at the Sherman Oaks location, because that is where my office is, and I have never been so disappointed in the service, or lack thereof.  As we approached the restaurant we knew there was going to be a long wait, as there were several groups waiting outside. We put our names down, and we were told that for a table of 7 inside it would be an hour and a half wait if not less. We decided to sit in the bar area and order a few drinks and appetizers while we were waiting for our pager to buzz. Approximately an hour and 40 minutes later, our pager buzzed and we went up to the front desk. We were then taken to our table, which was where we were just sitting! They sat us back in the bar area, had we wanted to dine there we could have ordered our dinner earlier and finished eating and not have waited an hour and half to be seated. In addition to the lousy seating area, the table cloth was dirty with recent stains from earlier guests. To make matters worse, the girl who brought us to our table, and whom we initially complained to, did not take the time to listen to our complaint or apologize. All she kept saying was I can get a manager. What was really infuriating was when we said we did not want to eat at this table, but to eat at a table in the dining area of the restaurant (which is what we were waiting to be seated for), she responded with: It's Mother's Day and you're going to have to wait a really really long time to be seated. At that point we asked to speak to a manager.  We waited and waited for a manager, the nice gentleman who was waiting our table earlier came by to check on us, he asked if a manager was coming, and he was very helpful. Ten minutes later we got another table, but the manager never came to talk to us, never diffused the situation or came to here our complaint, just ignored the problem and offered a different table (which we should have been seated at to begin with). Had the manager came he would have known that the table cloth was dirty, that his associate needed a lesson in customer service, and that we were dissatisfied with our visit before we had even ordered our dinner.  We were seated and greeted by a waitress who was filling in for our waiter who was on a break. She took our orders and introduced our waiter shortly afterwards when he returned from his break. Our food arrived and my order was wrong. I asked for no bacon, because I don't eat bacon, and she even repeated my request when I ordered, but of course my meal came with bacon and I had to send it back. This was the most miserable visit to the Cheesecake Factory, and will definitely not visit this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=760
Micole C.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,230,45,2.0,9/1/2011,"I didn't think a cheesecake factory could be worse than the one in Marina when it took on a hood element clientele (yeah i said it sue me or call the PC police i really don't care) but seriously if you go to this one for the view like i did don't waste your time and go to Marina location. First, we were seated outside & although the view was nice as you are literally right next to the water & boats they have these huge glass windowpane's blocking anything ocean or breezy it totally killed the whole vibe.  Now I am assuming that this is because of the short distance to the water that these huge panels are to prevent water blow back, but they are so big and tall they COMPLETELY block any possible or even hint of an ocean breeze which sucks. And I know it doesn't have to be like this because there is a now defunct restaurant next door that I saw when we walked on the pier & its windows opened, I mean the cheesecake factory could have had windows like that so their would be a breeze flowing...im sorry but aside from the view & environment in general one of the perks of ""ocean side eating"" is a nice ocean breeze and there is NONE here. Ill just keep going to Marina location because even though you aren't right next to the water as here, you don't feel trapped in a fish bowl and get nice breeze & view. Second, our waitress didn't like me. I have no clue what i did to this woman in a past life but she was horrible and to make it worse, I came with my bff & the waitress gave her impeccable service the whole time  -_-. I kid you not when I say this started from the beginning, her first time at the table she asked my best friend if she wanted something to drink, she told her what she wanted and then waitress went to get it, not once acknowledging my presence or asking me about my drinks. I wont keep going but it went like that the whole time. smh Finally, I think these are new but you absolutely must look at the skinnylicious menu and try the Chicken Samosas...OMG those are the best things that have hit my mouth in a long time.  Talk about flavorful & extra yummy they are a must try!!! oh but the skinny mojito bleh something was off about it & i didn't taste any rum... don't order. all in all i tried here because i  just discovered this location but i wont be back...ill just return to Marina like I've been doing for years, ill just go during the off peak hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=760

Sahar S.,"San Pedro, CA",137,17,1,1.0,12/14/2008,"This has always been a favorite spot of mine... picturesque location, good food, nice staff, and attentive service.  Note the word ""has.""  Although the location is as lovely as ever, and the food is still good, their service has hit the PITS!  No joke.  Seriously, I get better service at In-N-Out!  Cheesecake Factory: FAIL.  Big time. What happened to you old friend?  My reliable and constant friend is no longer....nope; it is now replaced by a shell with incompetent cooks and inept management.  How sad.  I guess as the economy goes down, The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) thinks that the level of service can go down, too.  How distressing. I paid a visit to TCF about ten days ago with a friend.  It was a Thursday night, and the place was comparatively busy.  I ordered a Raspberry Martini (très délicieux) and their scrumptious Avocado Eggrolls.  So far so good.  I ordered the Chopped Salad which comes with Romaine Lettuce, Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Avocado, Corn, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Apple and a House Vinaigrette.  Being the ever-so-picky eater that I am (wish I wasn't...but I am), I requested NO bacon, blue cheese, and tomato.  Rather, I asked them to double-up on the avocado and corn.  My friend ordered the Classic  Burger.  The waitress asked how he wanted it cooked and he said medium-well.   Our food arrived, and much to my dismay, my chopped salad was missing the corn and avocado.  The two items I had specifically requested were MIA.  How disappointing.  My friend's hamburger looked great on the outside - but inside, it was another story.  The hamburger he requested was medium-well.  What he got was medium-rare.  Big difference.  Like oozing with blood difference.  The waitress came by and I informed her about the mistake with my salad.  My friend explained the mistake with his hamburger.   The waitress was sweet and apologized to the both of us.  She said she would bring my items, and put in a new order for my friend.  He said told her ""no"" that it was OK, he would just eat the fries, but she wouldn't take NO for an answer.  He told her that he had lost his appetite for a hamburger (Eww, wouldn't you?).  So he ordered a Chopped Salad like mine - but with all the trimmings. About 10 minutes later, a ""Manager"" brought my missing items.  She then asked my friend what had happened to his order.  He explained it to her.  She apologized.  Although my salad looked amazing and tempting, I sat and waited for my friend's salad to come. Irritated?  Yes, a bit.  I turned to the manager and said in a cute-meets- persuasive-tone ""I'm sure you will make this up to us with a nice dessert.""  Hint-Hint.  The manager smiled and said, ""Oh, I've already taken care of his meal"" and walked away.   His salad arrived, and we were able to finally eat our meal.  Our waitress asked if we wanted any dessert, and we said no.  I eagerly waited for the check to come to see what the manager had done.  Much to my astonishment, the only ""action"" she had taken was swapping a salad for the hamburger!  All I could say out loud to my friend was ""WTF?  Really?  Are you effin' kidding me?"" So, Cheesecake Factory,  let me get this straight: 1.  You Efff-up on not only one, but BOTH orders 2.  You make us wait 3.  You DON'T volunteer a free dessert for your faux pas, much less offer         to make the entire meal ""on the house""  4.  You put a total damper into our dining experience 5.  When your customer (AKA , me) suggests that you ""throw in"" a       dessert for your bungling  mistakes, you reply with ""Oh, I've already      taken care of his meal"" 6.  You LIE about ""taking care"" of any part of his meal.  Deleting an order       that was incorrect and adding a new order of a salad does not        mean ""you've take care of his meal"" Capiche?  Let me repeat that,         CAPICHE? All I have left to say is Shame, Shame, Shame on you Cheesecake Factory!  My friend begged me to let this issue go...to not call in that ""manager"" for a few words.   I obliged.  However, if he was NOT with me, I would have let that ""manager"" know that what she did, or rather, what she DID NOT DO, was unprofessional and unacceptable.   With so many businesses going down the drain in this economy, with so many restaurants at our fingertips to choose from, do you really think that skimping on service will win you back former fans?  Not this fan.  Taco Bell does a better job training for their cooks and management!   What a total disappointment and what a total waste of a Thursday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=760

M. M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,31,10,1.0,6/17/2012,"While I really love the cheesecake here, I have to say it is the worst place to go and eat.  My trip today for a cup of coffee and cheesecake was the most basic thing to serve up.  First when I arrived the wait was fairly short, but they were so disorginzed at sitting people down.  All at once five or six groups were paged and asked to stand to one side until someone could lead them to their table.  That meant there were something like twenty people huddled around the host desk.  When we were led to our table apparantly a man sat down at our table to eat.  He left the bar area to sit down wherever he liked without regard to others.  Nothing was said to him, but I had to go back to wait to be called again.  When we were finally sat down, I noted that they had set the utensils on each side of a small dish with a napkin a top.  My first thought was that the utensils should have been placed on top of the napkin.   Supposedly all the table had been cleaned but there were all type of food stains on the sides and corners.  The cup of coffee that my husband and myself had ordered BOTH had lipstick on it.  The mug of water that was served up had all kinds of food debries on the rim of the glass.  The waitress wiped down the spoons that we had asked for before coming back to our table.  They must not have been clean, I think that the food stuck to the spoon itself gave it away.  The only thing I can say is YUCK!!!  The only plus here was that the waitress was so freiendly and cheerful.  I can say I will never be coming back htuck here again!!!  I am not the only one that thinks it's dirty and it's sad to say.   I may consider calling DHS on them. I agree with one of the other reviews that had mentioned the horrible coffee!  It's soooo TRUE!  Worst of all is that the waitress had decided to place the coffee cups on the table holding it by the top of the cup instead of using the holder.  So you mean you are going to tuch the rim of my cup where I am going to place my lips on?  Can you say bacterial transmission?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=760

C A.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,92,819,4.0,10/10/2009,"This location for this national chain has been an ""old faithful"" of mine for many years. You know the food will be nice, the cheesecake is always delicious, and it's a place to go for a casual or nicer event (I've been here for birthdays and graduations... I think even my own high school graduation). Even though the food isn't the greatest, the location is decent and though it can be a tight fit, they are able to accomodate large parties... a big enough party and you can probably set up something for the upstairs area.  Meals are a little pricy for what you get, but I guess you're paying for the atmosphere and the plates are very filling... I rarely have room for cheesecake after dinner. (ave. $16/ dinner plate and $7-8 for cheesecake) The things that annoy me here is that you can't make reservations... there is always at least a little bit of a wait, but it could be 30 to 45 minutes if there is some sort of event (like graduations). You may want to call and ask how long the wait is if you're hungry now. Also, you are pretty much forced to valet park which is more of a minor annoyance since it is cheap, but I like to park my own car. The service has always been pretty friendly, but sometimes they just disappear and you're left wondering when your drink will ever be refilled. This is a water front restaurant, but for some reason the view isn't very attractive here and I bearly notice it. The outdoor patio is nice, though it can get windy and keep the beach temp. in mind. The biggest draw for me comes on half price cheesecake day at the end of July?

I prefer the outdoor patio in the summertime, and the window seats away from the patio door on cooler nights.

""Um, I think I'll just stay with the diet coke"" ""You sure about that, sir, sometimes people are hesitant to try it because they've never heard of it, but it's new, and I personally prefer it over our conventional diet sodas"" ""Ya, I'll stick with the diet coke"" ""*looks away*... okay sir, got it""... *looks at me* ""And you?"" ""Diet coke, thanks"" This went on and on, with everything that 8-9 people ordered... from drinks to sandwiches, to salad, but mid-dinner, everyone was fed up and told the guy NO DESSERT just b/c he throws 15 options at you, you choose your own or one of them, and he looks away if you didn't get what he wanted.

So one friend told me they have happy hour so i gave it a try and let me tell you this is by far one of the best happy hours around! many many choices! the appetizers are regular size! ONLY $5! so they will fill you up. I've had the fresh made guacamole with chips it was tasty and super fresh! the crab wontons with cream cheese are to die for !! really good, you do taste the crab. Hmm what else oh the fried calamari is good too, their small salads are healthy and delicious, i saw another table get the sliders and they looked amazing and big! the only two things i don't recommend is the corn cake tamale that is super sweet and is not really a tamale because it has no meat, and the dumplings because they were a little oily. Now for drinks i got the mojito and i liked it, the margarita was good but stronger so u can get that if you want a buzz, the second time i went with my boyfriend we got beer i believe only $4 for an imported premium draft which is a good deal( we don't drink the light piss beers such as budlight,coors light, and those i rather have water! ). Monday-friday 4-6pm i believe but call and ask them the time.

Tosh I.,"Los Angeles, CA",570,806,604,3.0,8/18/2010,"Years ago, this was the place to go for several reasons: nice view of the boats in the harbor, a vast variety and a menu as extensive as a novel, so there's something for everyone, and enough food to take home for a second meal.  This is a great choice for large groups with picky eaters.   Also, the cheesecakes are good, but most of the time, one can be too full to truly enjoy them.   I recently came here again as we had a gift card.  Service seemed better than what I remembered.  The wait for my dish took longer than the rest of our party.  I didn't have to flag down the manager.  He informed me that my dish was being redone.   I appreciated the proactiveness.  But my spicy chicken was not up to par, and the manager graciously took it off the bill.  I was already semi full anyway from my fave, the avocado egg rolls. So I ""begrudgingly"" :  )  ordered dessert... the Red Velvet cheesecake.  This is no ordinary cheesecake as it was not on the menu the last time I came here.   Now, I have fond nostalgic memories of Red Velvet cake after living in Texas, so my expectations are high.  I'm also both delighted and disappointed at how mainstream it's become lately.  Bastardization of Red Velvet cake won't do! To enjoy the full effect, I had my Red Velvet cheesecake the very next night for dessert.  The cake itself was moist and had that hint of chocolate.  The white chocolate frosting and the whipped cream were divine.  Of course, the cheesecake section did not disappoint either.  I like the tiramisu here too.   It does add up here (both monetarily and calorie-wise), but you do get your money's worth.   It's fun to come here and order a bunch of appetizers and desserts to share with your friends.  We used to do that during the holidays.   This is a good place to take your out of town friends who visit so they can enjoy the view and have a plethora of food to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=780

Her shrimp still had a little bang bang it in it if you know what I mean. It grossed her out. Doo Doo vein in The shrimp. Sorry but that's a fail. We didn't get mad. Dion said no big deal took it back. 5 minutes later out comes this little man who I presume was the shift manager or supervisior or head douche. Standing at maybe 5 feet tall Mauricio spoke with my lady and said he didn't see any veins and he checked all the shrimp in her plate. As though we were making it up or something. Then was like are you gonna order something else or are you done. DUHH idiot she is obviously hungry yes we are!!! Now mind you our bill was $105 dollars. Drinks, appetizers, dessert, two entrees and a kids pizza. Mauricio AKA Little Big Man we don't need to have our food comped we got this.

Andrea D.,"Eugene, OR",55,227,20,2.0,8/20/2007,"I got some bug up my butt one night to go to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner.  I have no idea why, since I'd only been there once (like seven years ago) and don't really remember it being good or bad.  I think I just like the name and the potential for greatness that the name holds.  I mean, a factory that makes cheesecake?  Glorious. So we get there and it's jam-packed full of people and the wait was going to be at least an hour.  I would have loved to have waited outside since I get a little crazy around too many people, but it was February and freezing.  So we found a little ledge  to sit on while we waited near the restrooms and bakery display.   I noticed that there was a party rockin' the house in the banquet room on the second floor.  A few minutes later, the bride and groom from the reception came down and headed towards us.  I assumed they needed to use the restroom.  But then I realized that they were looking up.  Looking up at their photographer who was still up on the second floor balcony taking pictures.  He snapped a few frames of them standing in front of the entrance to the restrooms and he then came downstairs.  He then started snapping pictures of the bride and groom looking dreamy-eyed, not at each other....into the bakery display.   Now, I'm not married and I'm not a wedding photographer, but why would you want your wedding photos taken in front of the bakery section at the Cheesecake Factory?  Sure, it's cheesecake, but is it really that good? The whole scene was ridiculous (and it got worse when he had the bride piggyback the groom on the stairwell).  But it made the time waiting fly by because I could not stop laughing. When we finally were seated and had our food, I was highly disappointed that I had waited an hour for luke warm Nothing Special.  And my margarita was as expensive as the boy's meal.   At least the cheesecake was good.  Not worth commemorating with a photograph, but good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=840

Beth m.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,9,1,1.0,6/25/2011,"I took a friend from out of town there for a birthday dinner. Our waiters name was Julio, he gave us the worst experience. First of all, we waited forever to get even a water. We had bread on the table and we were ordering appetizers before water came. Alsowhile ordering he walked away, so that we had to call him back so we could finish. Then, my friend who I was treating to dinner, has an allergy to nuts. She told him so that he could provide her a different sauce for her appetizer. When she ordered her main course he neglected to tell her it also contained nuts. Thankfully she asked the girl who brought our plates, and found this information. Then, I know that for birthdays the restaurant usually provides a dessert, and the employees sing. And even though we informed him it was her birthday at the start, no such service was offered. When I paid the bill, I did NOT believe that Julio deserved a large tip from me. I left what I thought he deserved. I guess he thought he deserved more because when we were walking to my car, Julio follows us outside, calling that I forgot to sign the receipt. I walked back to sign, when he yelled that my tip was disrespectful and he did not want it. He tried to throw the money at me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! I told him to keep it. Then I asked for his managers name, which he was very hesitant to give me.  Honestly, I never want to go back to that place again.

After we arrived home both of us had to use the bathroom.

If i end up choosing something on the menu, I flip the page and pick something else.  This goes on for about ten minutes or so until I'm so hungry I just pick my fallback-the seared ahi steak with wasabi potatoes.   Sometimes, it tastes decent.  Sometimes, the steak isn't just seared. It's more like giant block of hard tuna that resembles canned kitty food.  I guess they forget and leave it on the pan too long. Don't ever get the Jambalaya Pasta.  Tastes like salt.  Literally, the pasta is so salted, you can't taste a thing.  I once tried it with rice to avoid the pasta (can't get it unsalted), and it was bland.  No flavor.

The bang bang chicken had shrimp and coconut in it and was like a very sweet curry. All of us were so full by the end of the meal, but wanted to try the cheesecake. We decided on the tiramisu and I think that was my favorite one I've tried on the menu so far. Cheesecake factory is always a safe bet when bringing visitors out to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
Paul K.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",126,9,,4.0,10/29/2009,Truly a great place for ambience and good food. Servers were great and prompt with the food. Hostess seated us right away! I would definitely recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
Jason U.,"Portland, ME",4,19,,4.0,1/6/2009,"If you have guests visiting you cant go wrong at any of the Cheesecake factory's. however this is my local one which I frequent alot. The best menu anywhere , good portions [ for lunch the next day ]. The Cheesecake is great. appetizers, get the avocado egg rolls, and buy some of the dip to go. its great with any appetizers. Main course. Cajun Jambalaya never fails me, nor do the pork chops, nor do the Sliders, nor does the chicken Marsala. Just go to any of them its all good. Mind you the Redondo beach branch is starting to smell a little mildewy. but hey its an old building next to the ocean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
I I.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,330,,3.0,10/17/2009,Service here was real nice.  You have to valet your car.  I have been to numerous Cheeseback Factories and this one was just as good as the others.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
Mae S.,"Torrance, CA",14,94,1,4.0,2/15/2009,"Been here one too many times.  It's a nice place to go when you want AMBIENCE.  It is kinda pricey though.  I can honestly say I have not gotten past the Asian Lettuce Wrap.  I love the drinks though.  There was one drink that I had that was HUGE and OH SO GOOD.  Bad when you are trying to avoid sweeets.  They helped me embarrass my friend by singing HAPPY BIRTHDAY to her.  She didn't see it comming (it was pay back).  Boy I hope she forgot about that day.  But, other then that nice friendly waitresses.  Hard to find sometimes but, nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
WENNIE L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",46,35,76,4.0,2/11/2009,"Food is mediocre, but I only go there for desserts, which are awesome.  My favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake (to die for), Tiramisu and Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake.  This location has a nice view of the marina.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
M M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,28,2,2.0,4/10/2011,"Food quality is inconsistent.  On one visit the Luau salad was fantastic, the next visit it was absolutely gross with soggy greens.  My other gripe is the unnecessary valet service (fee plus tip). There is ample parking but they force you to use the valet. On my last visit it was pouring rain.  When we came out of the restaurant we had to stand in blowing rain at the valet stand and when our cars finally arrived all of them were completely soaked on the drivers side. Why? Because the valets were sopping wet, clothes and all, and getting into our cars without giving it a second thought. Hell, they might as well have dumped a bucket of water on my seat. It all soaked  into my clothes on the drive home. Some friends had to drive back to the OC completely soaked.  If the valet hadn't been there sure we would have gotten a little wet running to our cars, but we would have been able to get into a dry car with dry seats.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
Julie D.,"Torrance, CA",4,147,65,4.0,6/24/2009,On the one hand I love eating outside but the service is a lot slower there so I tend to gage it on how hungry I am.  The food is always consistent and where else are you going to get that many options for Cheesecake?  It can get crazy on the weekends but you're usually good to go if you venture in to eat a late lunch after 2 PM...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
Julie S.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",15,112,,3.0,12/27/2006,"I had Sunday Brunch here about a month ago.  We had about a ten minute wait for a table.  So, we took a lovely stroll along the Marina behind the restaurant.  It was really nice! We could see little crabs in the water, a couple of fish and lots of nice boats.  We ended up being seated on the outside patio.  It was a beautiful day!  The food was good.  Cheesecake food is pretty consistant.  One detail I appreciated was the waitress knew we were splitting a smoothie.  Instead of bringing one smoothie and an empty glass for us to split it.........They split it for us in smaller glasses and completed both with the fruit garnish.  Nice touch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860

lady gagay f.,"Fremont, CA",4,57,44,4.0,4/18/2008,"This used to be the best cheesecake factory that I've been to so far. We went here Friday night and I was expecting that the wait is at least 2 hours, like SF. But as soon as we arrived we were seated right away. I liked the outdoor seats over looking at the water, it is very romantic at night. The only comment that I have is that you have to spend money for parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
Lawrence F.,"Carson, CA",59,295,1,3.0,10/13/2006,"As chain restaurants go, this one is pretty good. WAY too dark for my tastes though.

Jenna S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",81,46,4,5.0,9/17/2006,I have yet to have a bad meal at this place.  I absolutely love it!  Try the avacado egg rolls as an appetizer...they are amazing.  I also love the four cheese pasta among other things.  Oh...and if you go you have to get a slice of cheesecake...MMM...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
Krissy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",310,126,1,2.0,2/19/2008,"::Le sigh:: Ohh Cheesecake Factory, why has thou forsaken me? You used to be a really good chain -- bold, innovative, fun. But after 10 years plus of sameness, you're stagnant, boring, and assholes for allowing a ridiculously unnecessary valet outfit to camp out in your parking lot for the rate of $4 before tip. I give extra credit to our waitress at this location (Shanelle), who was very patient with me and my Vegan questions. She even had another waitress (a supposed vegan) come over to explain my options to me.  But that's where my compliments end, sadly. Firstly, HOW FREAKIN' LONG does it take to throw together the following simple dishes: 2 pastas, a lunch pizza and salad, and nachos. I mean really, HOW LONG?! Our table went through at least 3 rounds of diet coke and sprite whilst we waited and wasted away. And then it came. Nachos w/o much cheese, pizza oozing in grease, pasta with a soupy-cheese sauce on the side (even though my friend made a clear point of asking ""is the 4-cheese pasta consisting of grated cheeses or a cheesy *sauce?* 'Cause if it's the latter then I definitely do not want it""), and my order of Evelyn's Favorite Pasta which came absolutely *swimming* in a vat of oil. Ugh, disgusting. The amount of oil was so profuse it actually made the penne somewhat melt/ fall apart when it hit my mouth. Fast forward to Kim and I sending back our less-than-palatable lunches, followed by a 15-minute wait whilst the kitchen replaced our orders with something edible. All in all, everyone was underwhelmed.  And we got a parking ticket because our meter expired across the street. On a Sunday. In a holiday weekend. Ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-redondo-beach?start=860
