April V.,"Reno, NV",18,72,177,4.0,1/1/2018,"We were very surprised to see how many vegan options The Cheesecake Factory has today! I had the veggie burger made with brown rice, farro, mushrooms, black beans, and onion, served with lettuce, tomato, pickles and onion. If you omit the cheese and the mayo the burger is 100% vegan. I also had this served protein style (wrapped in lettuce) and a salad on the side, just to get in my extra veggies for the day.  My husband had a small Greek salad sans cheese and the avocado toast! All vegan!  Great option if you are a veg head and others are not.  Service was okay today, our server had no idea what ingredients were in our food and had to go back to the kitchen a few times but we figured it all out in the end. I wish this restaurant had an allergy menu, or informed the crew on dairy free options but all in all it worked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
Michelle H.,"Reno, NV",386,107,138,3.0,12/21/2017,"I've been to this location about 4 times now.  And my lack of two stars, is not for the food.  The food is always really delicious, and I for sure ate WAY too much. I loved seeing that they offer gluten free bread.  I usually try to just eat a burger without a bun, but I splurged and decided to go with the bun and sweet potato fries.  Delicious!  The but held up really well, sometimes when they're gluten free they will fall apart.  But this was great.   The only thing that seems to be lacking at this location is service.  It seems that every time I sit inside I'm there for a minimum of 2 hours.  I don't really want to sit at Cheesecake Factory for 2 hours.  I have things to do.  When I sit outside, the service seems to be great.  Order is taken quickly, food comes out in a reasonable time.  The check comes out on time.  I don't feel like I'm spending my whole day there, yet I don't feel rushed either.  But man, every single time I sit inside, it's a production, that lasts far too long.  I'm not sure if they just don't have the proper amount of wait staff inside, or people just get too busy.  But they need some help in that area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
Vickey A.,"Reno, NV",139,401,156,3.0,12/8/2017,"Food is still great, so there's that.  I'll be damned if they've learned how to handle a large party yet though. We had 16 of us at a holiday lunch today and 1 server. To be clear - we made a reservation.  Yes, there was a food runner, which meant more ""auctioning"" off orders, but that didn't help the fact that our food was brought out over the course of 10 minutes.  This means everyone is at a different stage of eating and it's kind of awkward.  When dessert rolled around there were at least 4 people that had to wait for silverware while being taunted by the tasty cheesecake sitting in front of them.   Overall it wasn't a bad experience but it most definitely could have been better.   I'm not sure why they didn't give us 2 servers??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
Michelle H.,"Reno, NV",98,27,1,1.0,1/8/2018,"I feel like kind of a jerk giving them 2 stars and only now writing a review because I have loved Cheesecake Factory for many years. We have eaten at this location many times and have always enjoyed the food and the service. This review is for the takeout and the food for THIS specific time. We ordered takeout on Christmas Eve.  My burger (see photo) had a lovely piece of string wrapped around it. Lost my appetite immediately for obvious reasons, and since we live across town, we weren't going to drive all the way back. Before I wrote a negative review, I try and talk to management first. That being said, I called them after finding said string.

Sam B.,"San Francisco, CA",287,109,31,5.0,11/8/2017,"Yum, yum, yum, yum.  One of my favorite restaurants. I have never had a bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory, they've all been great, but I have to say this one is my absolute favorite. I love the consistency this location offers. The food, the service, the atmosphere - always a joy.  My favorite entree is the fish tacos. It comes with four, so it's definitely a filling selection. It comes with rice and beans, I am not a fan of rice, so I get the sauteed spinach and it's delicious (I know it doesn't sound good with tacos. Ha! But I love it.)  They have a specious outdoor patio that they keep nice and toasty for the cold season.

Shannon J.,"Reno, NV",71,116,40,2.0,10/17/2017,"So this review is just on the take-out cheesecake counter.  On Friday night while browsing at the mall, I decided to get a slice of cheesecake to go with the husband. Since we were not eating a meal, we went to the to-go counter. There were three employees there and two servers chatting to them while filling orders. So I waited at the counter. And waited... five minutes later one of the three girls behind the counter finally asked to take our order. For a position that accepts T.I.P.S and suggests so on the receipt, I am surprised that no one could acknowledge me while I stood at the counter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6

I was and am still excited that this restaurant is here in Reno.  Makes it easier to convince my family who still think Reno is some small bodunk town in the middle of nowhere that it's not.

Kimberly N.,"Reno, NV",87,87,173,5.0,6/4/2017,"Yesterday was my daughter's 17th birthday and this was where she wanted to have her birthday dinner. Her day didn't start out well - she had to get up early to take a couple SAT's. Bummer! I mentioned to the hostess that it was her birthday and they sat us at a ""VIP"" table - which was really nice! The waitress was clued in and was so attentive and sweet. She really gave us the royal treatment!  While the food for our main meal was really good, I have to jump straight to dessert. All the wait staff came over to sing ""Happy Birthday"" and my daughter's cheesecake came out with a mini-sundae, extra whipped cream, chocolate-- just take a look at the picture! I cannot express how something that may not be a big deal to others made a huge impression on us. The manager even came over later to talk to my daughter about when she took her SAT and how stressful and mentally exhausting it was for her. These little gestures really turned my daughter's day around in a positive way and I can't thank them enough for their kindness.  Despite being a chain restaurant where this type of personalized service is unexpected, this Cheesecake Factory went above and beyond to make us, and especially my daughter, feel important.  If anyone that works there reads this, please know that you made a difference in somebody's day!  Words and actions matter. Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6

Jared A.,"Reno, NV",247,74,258,3.0,1/27/2017,"I love cheesecake! It's my favorite type of cake or pie or whatever you want to classify it as! But as for The Cheesecake Factory itself, it's just okay.  I've been here for dinner a few times, and the experience is always the same: a typically long wait to be seated, a typically long wait after ordering, a good, but not outstanding entree, and an amazing slice of cheesecake to end the night.  One of the problems I have with this establishment is the lack of reservations. I usually go here with a large party, so getting a table in a reasonable amount of time is not to be expected. It would be great if a place like this would accept reservations! Maybe then I can bump this review up to 4 starts. But since it's not, I would recommend going here anytime before dinner or just with a small party if you want to avoid waiting. So after getting seated, the real wait begins. At this point, everyone is starving, which is probably why they don't accept reservations. The warm, complimentary bread softens the blow, but in the end, it fills you up too much. And you can never finish your entree, which can be a good thing because leftovers! So, the waitress first asks for drink orders, then comes back with the drinks after what seems like 10 minutes. Then she asks us for our orders, and we ordered a few appetizers, which came out in another 15 minutes. They were nothing spectacular, just good. Then 10-15 minutes later, our food finally arrives. So after waiting over an hour to be seated and after waiting over 30 minutes after taking a seat, we can finally eat. Like I said, the food is okay. I got Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. The sauce was creamy and the chicken wasn't overcooked, but I've definitely had better at other chain restaurants. The one this this place does have over other chains is portion size. The portion sizes here are ridiculous! This can easily be three normal sized meals. But I guess the portion size matches the price because this place is expensive! The entree was about $20.00, but the quality wasn't. This restaurant might be the epitome of quantity over quality.  As for the cheesecakes here, they are to die for! They are the main reason why this review is three stars instead of two. The cheesecake itself is dense, but creamy. Sweet and rich, but not too decadent.  And light, but not to the point where the other flavors overpower the cheesecake. I would definitely recommend any of the fruit flavored cheesecakes. The chocolate/caramel/candy variations are just too decadent for me. The cheesecake was the perfect end to what would otherwise be a forgetful meal. As for the service, I found them to be really nice and accommodating. After being seated, our waitress was kind, friendly, and regularly checked up on us. She refilled waters very often, and she even offered to split the check.  As for the ambiance, I don't particularly like it. It's WAY too dark. I know low-lighting is supposed to make things more intimate, but this place takes it to a new level. I wish they would turn on the lights just a little bit. But other than that, this place is a little more upscale than your typical chain restaurant. It has a classier vibe, but I still can't get over the lights, or lack thereof. Overall, just go here for the cheesecake. And I would just recommend take-out. The wait was long, the food was unmemorable, the lights were nonexistent, but the service was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
Anna M.,"Reno, NV",106,82,304,3.0,6/27/2017,"I have ate here numerous times and when I think of a sweet treat my first thought is Cheesecake Factory, I love the fact that it is open late and you don't have to go through a crowded, drunken, smoke infested casino, to get decent food before Midnight. I have always had constantly good food from here, and the Cheesecakes are to die for, I would like to try everyone on the menu!! I came in the other night for some appetizers and Cheesecake. I was just so disappointed. We ordered hot spinach and cheese dip, it was seriously lacking flavor...made me so sad, it was just really bland. So I guess I will just stick to what I know is safe and just order Cheesecake from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
Trista B.,"Reno, NV",0,23,5,4.0,10/13/2017,"I was very eager to try this restaurant after hearing all of the hype about it. The interior was very classy and comfortable- other than being connected to a mall. (Makes for a busy parking situation).  The menu is massive and makes it slightly difficult to decide on an entree. I decided on fettuccine Alfredo and I wasn't extremely impressed, but not disappointed either. The food wasn't bad, however It was a little bland. I chalked it up to the fact that they have a massive menu and it makes it hard to perfect each meal when that is the case. The service was great, and we did order a slice of cheesecake for dessert- which was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
William S.,"Reno, NV",18,79,23,4.0,5/27/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory in Meadowood Mall is a restaurant that I visit every couple of months.  I have found the food and service consistently to be good and they do live up to a reputation as being the place to go for cheesecake.   If I was to comment I would say that a lot of their food is ""heavy"".  It is very good - but I like to get the lunch size because the dinner portions almost always have a to go bag.  On my last visit I had the ""Shepard's Pie"".  (By British standards this would actually be a Cottage Pie since it's made with beef instead of lamb).  Cheesecake Factory uses a high quality beef and the dish overall is very good. My friend had a salmon dish which was also very good. This location has both indoor and outdoor seating with heat in the winter.  It is on the outside of the mall so you can shop or just walk around after dinner inside.  I also have never run into bad service with the staff always being friendly and helpful. After a dinner we usually slit the cheesecake.  I really enjoy the season options including pumpkin around Halloween.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
Tom Y.,"Felton, CA",1,88,1,3.0,9/16/2017,"The first time we've been to this location.  Stopped for lunch after some shopping.  The place was still nearly empty, yet we still had to wait over 5 minutes for seating ... Seriously. The food was really, really good, Fettuccini, Cuban sandwich, the Garlic Parmesan bread, cheesecake for dessert. The service was just okay. The cost was very expensive for what we had.  Seriously $9.50 for a half glass of cheap wine, I could have bought three bottles at Trader Joe's for $9.50. Definitely not something place we'll be coming back to. We can eat at most every restaurant in town with comparable food quality for about half what Cheesecake Factory charges. Between the wait, the average service and cost I feel generous giving them the Stars, only because the food was so yummie",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
Samantha W.,"Reno, NV",208,198,531,3.0,10/26/2016,"Well, I'm not overtly excited about this place. It was nothing super amazing and exciting and I was so thrilled with my visit, but it wasn't also terrible that I want to forewarn future patrons.  It's a nice little place with decent food. If you're looking for a finer dining setting either in the mall or in the area, this place is great.  The appetizer my husband and I shared was PHENOMENAL! it was the parmesan garlic cheese bread. Do get this. You won't regret it if you love cheese and garlic bread. I may go back just for this appetizer and the cheesecake. My dinner wasn't amazing. I got the four cheese pasta. I wasn't thrilled with it. It wasn't spiced amazingly, nor were any flavors worth ""writing home about"".  Service wasn't awful. We were seated on a Monday night around 6 almost instantly. Our waitress was prompt on drink and appetizer orders. Once she got our entrée order, she seemed to be nowhere. Trying to order dessert took a little longer than I would have liked. But she was super friendly and cordial and joked with us. We had a gift card that we were given as a wedding present and that's the only reason we came here. As far as future date nights here, probably not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
Brandy W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",83,460,45,4.0,3/16/2017,"Like ever other Cheesecake Factory in the nation, it has pretty tasty food and definitely something for everyone on their enormous menu. I was impressed that although this is the smallest CF I've ever been in, they didn't subtract any menu items. I would think this could even pass for a CF Express, if those exist. It's really 1/3 the size of most I've eaten at.  The prices are pretty expensive, but that bread they bring out to start is just so darn delicious. We all fight over who gets the squaw bread! My kids can't get enough.  During Christmas they run a promo to buy an eGift Card for $25 and you get TWO cheesecake slices free. Considering the price of cheesecake is like $7/slice, it's worth it. We always grab some of those and indulge when the winter starts getting the best of us and we need to escape the house.  We've had so many things, but love the avocado eggrolls, southwestern corn cakes, orange chicken, their Evelyn's veggie pasta, and avocado toast. My kids share the sliders meal because they are light eaters and it comes with two burgers about the size of two McD burgers with fries. It's totally plenty for them.  Always return and always like it... but nothing beyond extraordinary. Just good, solid food that pleases everyone. And that Godiva cheesecake is the very best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
Kelly L.,"Reno, NV",0,3,,2.0,12/18/2017,"Went on Saturday at 1pm with a friend. We waited about 20 minutes for a table but that was totally expected.  After we had sat down and waited for awhile, two other people were sat at the table right next to us. When our server finally came by she took the next table's order first. My issue was not that she took the other table's order first but when she was taking their order, her butt was on our table, she was practically sitting on our table! Not cool.  Anyway, we were already there and it was getting late for lunch so we thought we would just order and eat.  Food was decent, I thought the egg roll samplers were tasty. I've been to Cheesecake several times and I've always enjoyed the food. Two-star rating is not a reflection on food but on the service.  She should have really stood on the other corner of the table or make little more space between the tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6
Lauren K.,"Reno, NV",53,139,767,4.0,2/16/2017,"Open late and always busy. So generally I am not a very big fan of chain restaurants. The food tends to be uninspired, not locally sourced and just leaves you thinking, man with all the amazing places in Reno, why did I just spend 20-40 dollars for a frozen meal basically. Well, not that cheese cake factory doesn't run into some of the things you find in chains, they have fresh food that's cooked to order. And it's actually quite tasty. I have yet to find a better veggie burger locally and there's is huge. I live near by so when it's a late night after the gym I order curb side to go veggie burger with sweet potato fries, side of ranch. Their ranch is really good and buttermilk based and you can buy it along with their other dressings in a jar for 5-6 dollars, by the cheese cake display. The veggie burger is large and in charge and you won't be missing meat with chunks of  brown rice, farro(adds a nice texture), couscous, mushrooms for meatiness, black beans, chopped veggies. PETA website says if you hold the cheese and mayo with the sour dough bread, it is vegan. Holds together nicely and isn't dry at all. The Fontina cheese was melty and stringy and the tomatoes seemed cut to order as well as the onions, very fresh.  The sweet potato fries are yummy in the ranch and come in a cute paper bag that soaks up any extra oil. Curb side to go, you also still get bread if you want.  Couldn't help myself checking out staring at the cheese cakes. I got the carrot cake cheese cake, moist with chunks of raisins and nuts with the super sweet cheese cake and cream cheese frosting. It was ready in the amount of time the girl quoted on the phone. I have eaten here during busy hours and it can be a 2 hour ordeal. Just keep that in mind if you have a movie or something to get to. The patio also offers nice area to sit with heat lamps and appetizers are huge as well as their portions. Their curb side to go has never let me down. The order is always right and they go over it with you before you leave by showing you each item is up to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=20
Michelle G.,"Reno, NV",115,136,327,3.0,3/3/2017,"Who doesn't love cheesecake? I believe it's in its own food group. However I was taught to eat my dinner first then dessert. If and only if you eat all your dinner. So I ordered the steak tacos. The taste was good but they seemed rather small. It does come with rice and beans but the temperature needed to be increased. One of my pet peeves is lukewarm food. I am sure our server was busy, as well as the cooks but nothing is worse than allowing food to come out at the incorrect temperature. Did I have cheesecake after dinner? You betcha... Banana Cream... You redeemed some of my negative impressions by delivering this creamy, piled high with fresh sliced bananas, and out of this world fresh whipped cream.  Wow....

Can't wait however, to go back here again next time for some appetizers and libations  So we came back to this restaurant for our wedding anniversary dinner on June 30th, I anticipated a big crowd and long wait since it's Friday night on the 4th of July weekend, so I decided to call ahead and spoke to a sweet-voice Maitre D Megan, she said that they don't normally take reservation but since I mentioned my husband and I are celebrating our 17th year anniversary, she said she will try her best to get us a table fit for the occasion. We came in and introduce myself and figured the bright eyed sweet smile hostess was Megan.  She was very accommodating and sat us on a big nice private booth to have our special dinner. I thought that was an awesome customer service, our server Zac was also great, he was polite to ask for drinks and dinner bread with butter to start with while we peruse the menu.  We decided to start our meal with their so called ""fire crackers, it's a delightful appetizer, lightly cooked salmon wrap with spinach veges covered by a light wonton wrapper with a salad of purple cabbage and an exotic sesame soy dressing.  I have ordered their factory combo - Steak Diane & grilled salmon with steam rice and asparagus and Rick ordered Medium rare New York steak with mashed potato & some summer Veges, I have also requested for my Cosmo Martini as my dinner drink.  When our food came in the presentation was so first class restaurant look and as we tasted our food it was superb!  our compliments to the Chefs which we advise our server Zac to mention to the Chef.

Marlon T.,"Reno, NV",1084,2369,1519,3.0,6/9/2016,"I don't usually go to huge chain restaurants like this unless a friend really wants to, so I ended up here on a Sunday brunch and had a decent experience. It was one of those times where the corporation was doing it mostly right and things weren't really slipping through the cracks. My outside table was well-placed, the service was excellent, but the food was not the best (more to come on that). I've never had Sunday brunch at a Cheesecake Factory so I had to try something on the brunch menu--I went with the Chicken and Waffles Benedict. The only place in the world that I've liked Chicken and Waffles is in Washington, D.C. at Founding Farmers restaurant. For some reason I keep thinking I might like it elsewhere, especially if there is a twist on it (in this case with eggs and tasty hollandaise sauce). Well, while the dish might've been a little more enhanced than I expected, I still did not like it as much. Furthermore, the ""potatoes fries"" that it came with were overcooked and too crunchy. The plate was mostly brown, and it could've been garnished with some color. So, I would definitely not recommend this dish and wish I had gotten something else. I'd definitely give 4 stars if it wasn't for the flop on the food. So, it's a chain and if you're not a huge food snob, then you'll probably have a better time here than I did.

It was very busy today, and even had some birthdays while there. However, this didn't stop the great service I got. I ordered a dr. Pepper, and fried macaroni to start. It was very good, but that combined with the bread made me more full than expected. I should have skipped appetizer. For my entree I chose the white bean chicken chili. This comes with a nice layer of rice at the bottom of the bowl. It doesn't look like much, but it was very good and I was only able to finish half of it. I ordered the coffee cream chocolate supreme cheesecake to go, which was also verrrry good when I ate it later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=20

Usually visiting a chain restaurant doesn't top my list because they are all the same, right? Well my daughter and I visited last week and I was seriously disappointed.  It was loud, dishes banging around and sounding like they were thrown into dish tubs. It was later in the afternoon,  not even lunchtime. I asked for lemon in my water, didn't happen. Our waitress was more consumed with up selling our experience. Eh, not appealing. We took slices of cheesecake to go. Me and my husband's were good but my daughter's was just ok. A big glob of cookie dough was plopped on top not inside if the cheesecake. It was disgusting!

We ordered the portobello, avocado and zucchini fries as an appetizer which have always been wonderful and just as wonderful this time too. I ordered the lunch special Chicken Piccata which is always one of my favorites.  The lunch special size is so perfect since its so tasty that I tend to keep eating after I am full. This time was no different. I cleaned the plate and have no idea how I managed to fit it all in my stomach. My friend ordered the lunch special Chinese Chicken salad which amazed me on how HUGE that thing was! It looked fantastic and she loved it. Its one of her favorite items.  I am never able to leave without cheesecake but I knew I was so full I wouldn't be able to eat it so I ordered my favorite one, the Oreo Cheesecake to go to snack on tomorrow.

Located in the meadowood mall , there is ample parking. We arrived around 1:30, and had to wait only five minutes. They restaurant is very clean and well lit, and is decorated with a very warm and welcoming touch. It can get a bit loud, the tables are very close together. The size of the restaurant is much smaller than the other cheesecake factories we have been to. I started out with potatoe soup. This was delicious, chock full of potatoe chunks, cheese, sour cream and chives. My entree was a Cobb salad. Included in the salad was bacon , chicken,tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, and cheese. I changed the dressing from vinaigrette to thousand island. The salad was huge, and delicious. I would get it again in a heartbeat. We ended with cheesecake for dessert. The reason for three stars is this restaurant is expensive. For both of us it came to seventy one dollars with tip.

What really made our night, though, was our server, Danielle M.  When she checked my friend's ID and didn't say anything about it being her birthday, I was really surprised (as a server myself I know how easy but important that can be). However, she HAD noticed, and instead of saying anything she brought out her cheesecake all decked out with a candle and pretty ""Happy birthday"" writing. The staff came over to sing and we were all wondering who had asked for that. Then, I realized it was just Danielle killing it at her job. Thought that was really cool. On top of that, my hubs and I both have pretty specific drink orders, she was patient with us and both drinks came out perfect.

Kevin J.,"Berkeley, CA",394,110,57,5.0,2/18/2016,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory so I didn't know what to expect, besides the crazy wait. The crazy wait aside (which you should know about when going to any sit-down mall restaurant anyway), this Cheesecake Factory is a good ride!  The menu is very diverse, with lots of meat and pasta classics, but also some more interesting modern fusion offerings like an ahi carpaccio (thin sliced raw ahi tuna with sauce). I personally had a steak diane+herb salmon combo for $21, and both were made very well. The salmon was seasoned nicely with a good sear on the outside while still remaining moist on the inside, and the steak diane was cooked to a beautiful medium rare.  And of course, you can't forget the cheesecake. Lots of tasty-looking offerings, some of them worse for you than others. I shared the Oreo cheesecake with my sister and we had a hard time polishing it off. That thing is intense. Tasty but intense.  Service was great, especially considering it was Saturday of Valentine's/President's Day weekend, so it was pretty busy. Irene was warm, friendly, and knowledgeable while juggling multiple tables and still remaining timely and attentive towards our needs (more bread, water refills, checking in on us after our entrees arrived, patiently giving us her recommendations on cheesecake choices, etc.) Truly a rockstar!

Jennie Z.,"Sparks, NV",96,60,9,3.0,2/1/2017,"About half way through my visit - I had already determined that this was going to be a 1-2 star review. I brought my family here - a visit that had been built up and postponed for a better time for over a week. We were SO excited. The visit had a terrible start... 2/3 of our knives were dirty with actual dried food (not just water marks)... it took over 10 minutes for them to even take our beverage order - and then brought the adult soft drinks out, saying my daughter's drink would be there shortly - it was another 5-7 minutes at least. They were clearly training multiple employees this day, which is fine, but they were so busy and people were tripping over each other and the duplicate waiter/waitresses was very crowded and made the already busy establishment even busier. It was very overwhelming. Now comes our food.... My chicken salad sandwich was - eh... super greasy bread, I decided to try to eat just the chicken salad and ditch the bread... HOLY SALTY AWFULNESS. The side salad with the house vinaigrette was pretty tasty. But i wouldn't suggest their cream of chicken soup - it tasted like they took Campbells canned soup and through artichoke hearts in it. My daughter LOVES their orange chicken- which i tasted and was pretty good. We also ordered the pancake breakfast with eggs and bacon. You should be warned that their standard syrup is a BUTTER Syrup - which after we complained about the weird taste - they identified that the warmer hadn't been property turned on - causing us to get a not-warm-not-mixed combination of butter and syrup... YOU CAN REQUEST REAL MAPLE SYRUP WITHOUT BUTTER which i highly suggest. When we brought the awful syrup to their attention - their responsiveness to our complaint was the reason that they got bumped up to a 3 star review. They apologized, corrected the situation promptly, explained what caused it, made us a brand new plate of food to-go. The manager even came by to apologize after our initial waiter was able to resolve the issue without any hesitation. The crappy experience turned into a good one - for the most part. Overall - the food is overpriced and not the best.... the cheese cake is truly the only reason to go there. Eat food somewhere else - and dine in for cheese cake - or even just get the cheesecake to-go. I've never had bad cheesecake there - all of the flavors are delightful! Tiramisu is my fave!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=60

We sat on the heated porch and service was admittedly a little slow, but we weren't in any rush. Our waitress came and she was very sweet, bringing us our drinks quickly after arriving to the table...can I just say their Arnold Palmer is really great!  The menu has so many great things, it took me forever to decide, the little longer wait really wasn't a problem for us. My hunny decided on the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich, and I feeling the hunger of not eating lunch that day, ordered with my eyes instead of my mind when I asked for the Macaroni and Cheese, Cheese Burger with sweet potato fries... I thought one bite and boom...heart attack, but my eyes couldn't get past the visual I was seeing in my mind, and the burger wasn't disappointing...  A medium burger for me which means pink, with a fried macaroni ball, topped with cheddar cheese sauce. After my first bite, it wasn't the heart attack that got me, it was the fact that I had died and gone to heaven from happiness! I don't know if it was the hunger of the day catching up to me, the absolute, sinfully delicious burger, or a combination of the both, but I am going to go ahead and say, BEST burger I've had in a long time.

Katie P.,"Reno, NV",167,81,90,3.0,5/30/2016,"I'm going to preface this review with saying their cheesecake is bomb. I mean, if you're ever in need of a really fantastic way to bow out of your diet in a truly epic way, get one of their ridiculous slices of signature I-just-gained-30-pounds-in-my-ass-like-literally-as-I-was-eating-cheesecake. I suggest taking it to go and eating it alone, as you watch Friends on Netflix, in your dirty sweats, while crying. It tastes better that way.  Now, onto their food. It's good. Really. Every time I've gone, it's been seriously lip-smackingly-tasty. The problem I have is the amount of choices on their book of a menu. It's like way beyond overwhelming. It's one thing to have a lot of variety in one realm of food options, like many different choices of Italian fare. At least that way it narrows your decision making down a tad. On The Cheesecake Factory menu you can travel, by way of your palate, to Asia, Mexico, Italy, the South, Texas, and many more, I'd bet. Too.many.options. How can any single person decide between chicken piccata and chicken and biscuits? How? Tell me how!  OK, now that I've discussed their cheesecake and food options, I must mention their service. It could be improved upon. This excludes the cheesecake desk where you can walk up, order your demise, and slip out, without too many noticing you really don't need cheesecake. Every person I've come into contact there has been uber friendly. The area they need to improve upon is their waitstaff. This last time I went and ate in the restaurant with a friend. I wouldn't say it was incredibly busy, but the wait for everything was so long. Fat-kid-waiting-for-his cake-long. Now, if the servers are really working up a sweat, and I can tell they are working their tails off, I don't mind a wait. No. Our server didn't seem to mind making us wait 20 minutes for our Coke Zero.  All in all, The Cheesecake Factory will always make a killing with their cheesecake alone. I'll just have to get a slice to go instead of sitting down and spending more money on a full meal. Such is life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=60

Shame on these big chain restaurants that hire young inexperienced help, then promotes them to position of leadership with little if not zero training.  I know if I was in the service industry and my income relied on customer service and return customers, I would have my people trained on how make our customers have the optimal dinning experience.   NOT HERE I know realistically people will drop the ball, if you read my last review back in December of 2014, you will see that the staff drop the ball there too, just the food was really good.  This time we didn't get any food, because we NEVER got waited on.......

I ordered the lunch-sized Shepherd's Pie (you can still order off the lunch menu fairly late) and my wife had the three-cheese pasta (regular size). My dish was steaming hot and full of flavor. I loved the mushrooms and julienned zucchini- better than the standard frozen peas and carrots at other places. My wife enjoyed her pasta, and had enough to take some home for lunch the next day. My lunch portion was perfect. No leftovers :) We then split a slice of Reese's Cheesecake. Wow! Decadent! I loved the variety of textures and layers- no bite was exactly the same. Just what you want when splitting a slice.  Overall the only thing that made it not worth 5 Stars was the price: $50 without tip.

Katie J.,"Reno, NV",201,102,304,3.0,1/27/2016,"We stopped in to have some appetizers in the bar area and were very please with the attentive service that we received from our waiter. The ambiance is just like any other of their chain restaurants world wide, and so is their foods quality. We tires the chicken samosas for the first time and it only took us 3 more seconds to completely devour the ""small plate."" It comes with 5 triangle shaped fried wonton rolls stuffed with curried chicken and a cilantro-lime sauce. Just YUM! We also ordered the Tex-Mex rolls which we have had before and they didn't miss a beat. Stuffed with corn, black bean, and chicken, they come with just a little of a spicy kick but is safe for people like me who are spice-intolerant to enjoy. This also comes with the same cilantro sauce as the samosas. Overall, nothing else to report about Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=100
Jessica R.,"Sparks, NV",253,381,401,4.0,1/4/2016,"My family and I were treated to the cheesecake factory for my 26th birthday. I was pretty impressed with the inside when walking in. To the left is a case of all of their specialty cheesecakes you can feel free to drool over while you wait for your table.  I suggest calling ahead of tome and making a reservation because they were pretty busy. Despite that, we were seated within 30 mins which was really nice. We just went next door inside of the mall and watched the kids play in the play area. They gave us a ring and a text message on our phone when our table was ready.  I was a huge fan of our server. She was very sweet, polite, and prompt despite being as busy as she was. I do think they seemed a little understaffed.  For the food, I was a little disappointed. I ordered off of the lighter fair menu. It was lemon shrimp scampi with asparagus. My plate was REALLY lacking flavor. Honestly, I could've expected better taste from a box. It was also kind of cold and dry, as though it had sat waiting after done being cooked for the rest of the food to come out. My fiancé ordered a Kobe beef burger with bacon, mushrooms and fries. He's pretty simple when it comes to food. We're talkin' top ramen simple. He said and I quote, ""yea, it was really good"" when asked if he liked his burger. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich for my six year old with a side of fruit (which looked really soggy) and mac & cheese for my two year old. I tried a bite of it when he wasn't looking. It was pretty good. My grandma ordered what looked comparable to KFC popcorn chicken. She was expecting it to be Cajun, but she said it wasn't spicy at all. She seemed pretty disappointed with her meal although she said the vegetables it came were very tasty. Sadly, that was all she said she enjoyed. She said it would've been better if the chicken were seasoned more. My grandpa ordered curry seafood jambalaya. He allowed me to try a bite of his food. I liked the flavor, but the pieces of meat were really small compared to the heaping pile of rice.  I guess they wouldn't call it the ""cheesecake factory"" if they did not indeed serve cheesecake, and their cheesecake be pretty dang delicious enough to build a restaurant around the entire concept. The cheesecake was the highlight of my whole night. I ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake. If ever one could taste a piece of heaven, this was my version. If one could fall in love with flavor, this would be my first food love in 25 years. Holy cow was it delicious. Had I not been full from earlier, I would have devoured the entire thing. For one I love a good cheesecake, two... I love macadamia nuts, three... I love LOVE white chocolate. Okay getting off of the subject. Anyhow, my fiancé ordered a ultimate peanut butter chocolate cheesecake so naturally I snuck a bite. It tasted just like a reeses peanut butter cup dipped in cream. I ordered a slice of carrot cake cheesecake for my younger two to share, this one I was slightly let down with because the other two were so good. It wasn't very sweet and the cream cheese frosting wasn't very good. My grandma ordered tiramisu cheesecake. I'm not a huge fan of tiramisu to begin with so skipped sampling this one. She said that her cheesecake was and I quote, ""very good."" The verdict: would I return? We all felt it was a little pricy for the portion and flavor of the main courses, but as they have a very vast menu, I would give the cheesecake factory another chance and try something else. *I came back with some girl friends and ordered a few appetizers. I was a HUGE fan of the calamari and the wraps. We sat outside on the patio. Loved the ambiance.*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=100

My Sister was sweet enough to drive to the Mall and bring one home for me. It was so disappointing. Nothing like my previous visits or the picture. Literally 1 piece of caramelized onion 2 pears and 4 sprigs of Arugula and a total of 4 nuts. Plenty of Gorgonzola though. Apparently the trainers have all gone home and nobody's following specks or recipe cards. I Manage a major Chain restaurant and know what a stickler we are.

My waitress this last time couldn't even remember simple things like what we had ordered for drinks or that we had asked for sides. Normally this wouldn't bug me, but when they expect to be tipped handsomely for a fifty dollar ticket I expect the same kind of service that tip requires.

Mike S.,"Sparks, NV",605,179,15,5.0,8/22/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is as an American institution as any other restarunt chain. There seems to be a bit of hatred for chains on Yelp and when I read certain reviews I am often pondering, ""Why don't you just stay home and eat a baloney sandwich on Wonder Bread?"". Chains may or not be locally owned, but they are locally operated and you can count on their consistency, if nothing else. They placed this location in what used to be 775 Gastropub and, hell if I can remember what it was before that, I remember thinking when I heard it would be in this location, I thought ""Wow, that's gonna be tight!"" Much to my surprise, the architechts did a hell of a job and it probably helped that they added more outside dining and expanded into the neighboring unit. Sizewise it is about the same as any other Cheesecake Factory located in a shopping mall. Maybe not quite as large as the one in SF that takes up an entire floor or the freestanding locations in other parts of the US, but it is easily twice the space of the previous tenant. It's new and it's in Reno and it's the Cheesecake Factory, so I anticipated a long wait. We were quoted 60-90 minutesm but they texted us in less than half an hour to let us know that our table was ready. With the other review in mind, I saw no people waiting in the dining area to be called to their table. Nor was there any staff watrching me to see if I was going to boost the silverware.  The food was superb. The Vietnamese Summer Rolls and Ahi Tartare were perfect starters. I had a Cuban sandwich with a side salad and have officially dubbed it the Best Cuban you can have in Reno. My wife ordered a chicken and pasta dish, which was also very good.  I washed it down with two Bicardi Mojitos and we finished with the Red Velvet Cheesecake. The most impressive thing I took away was how well the mall has improved since my last visit here mabe 6-7 months ago. The new flooring, lighting and overall cleanliness of what used to be ""Ghettowood"" surprisingly reminded me a lot like Stoneridge in Pleasanton. I wonder if these imporvements had to do with getting Cheesecake Factory to open or reflect new management/ownership? Either way, it left me with the impression that cheesecake Factory is a welcome addition to the area. I hope they do well, the local skinflints will decry the prices and the baloney sandwich eaters will still hate on it, but I will remain a fan and who knows, maybe we'll see a Grand Lux in the near future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=100

Anyhew, many visits and calories later...here we are.  Friday night and I wanted some chicken and biscuits.  That is like one of my favorite things on the menu.  Nice large portion, hot, perfectly cooked.  Yum Yum.  The man had the New York Strip, said it was delicious.  We both love the mashed potatoes.  Delicious.  Waiter was friendly and attentive.  Brought his beers and my iced tea right away, kept them full and kept bread on the table.  Yay.  The place is always crowded, but clean and well staffed.  I like the outdoor patio for sure when the weather is nice.  I have tried like five different cheesecakes, always delicious.   My only complaint...not really a complaint, it just is what it is and I know would annoy some people, is that it is VERY loud in there.  It has the Cafeteria sound...very loud, chatty and if you are near the kitchen like we were, you will hear every single dish.  That is really the only negative.  It is not expensive, but it is not cheap either.  You will pay $17-29 a plate.  Appetizers about $10.  For two of us to have one appetizer, two meals, two beers and an iced tea it was $72.00!  So, it ain't  Applebees 2 for $20, but hey, I like it.  Yummy and you will have your favorites in no time.

Nancy V.,"Reno, NV",261,708,905,3.0,9/4/2016,"Yep - I agree with just about everyone else. It is A-OK. Nothing fantastic, definitely not horrible, but . . . . . it is a chain. We were at the Mall, it was lunch time, we were hungry, we had not been here, and what the hell, why not. Better than the mob scene at the food court.  We went in, and were seated right away - no wait. The space looks totally different from when it was 775 Gastropub. It seems a bit opulent and over the top in a Vegas plastic/glittery sort of way. tables are a bit close together and it is really hard not to hear the conversations on either side. We were seated in the bar area and could look out through the glass on the back of the bar to the patio outside. The patio looks like a nice addition to the space.  We were greeted by our server and offered drinks and were given time to look over the ginormous menu. I guess they want to have a little bit of everything in case a food fusser might show up.  We ended up with sandwiches - I had the Classic Club and my husband had the Chicken Parmesan both with fries. My sandwich was OK. It was HUGE, but but pretty standard. The lettuce was shredded (a big no-no in my book) and the tomatoes were fresh, but had no flavor. The bacon was crispy, but cold and the enormous wad of sliced turkey tasted processed. It really wasn't awful, it was just uninspired. The fries, however, were really good. Piping hot and crispy, not too much salt, and served in a paper cone in a silver cup. Classy.  We did not have any cheesecake - I know, it is their signature item. Maybe another time. We were quite full and had lots of leftovers to take home for another meal.  I would not go out of my way to eat here again, but if I was at the mall, I might consider it.

We enjoyed decaf coffee and could not help but notice, during our meal, if anything was lacking, as in a coffee refill or the bread basket, we did not have to hunt down our waitress, someone walking by immediately refilled for us.

I asked if they could upgrade my steak, she said she had to ask the manager. So then here comes the manager talking about they got the wrong order and the steak Diane never came in, then she says she can sell me the $29 fillet and add on a side of shrimp for $5.... my combination went from $22 to $34! Umm no! She apologized and said I'll give you some time to look over the menu... there I am staring aimlessly at the menu trying to tell myself i didn't really want steak anyways and that I'll find something better on the menu.

I didn't want to ruin dinner for my son and my husband so i just closed my eyes and pointed to something, because let's face it, nothing is going to top steak. So... I ended up ordering shrimp pasta.

Kay C.,"Northwest Reno, Reno, NV",121,7,,1.0,3/21/2017,"My husband, I and our toddler visited this location last night for dinner.  No crayons or activities for the kiddos - which has been my first experience ANYWHERE, so keeping a 3 year old busy throughout the dinner was a challenge in and of itself.  We ordered the crab artichoke appetizer and it was delicious, although very greasy. Then a chicken sandwich for myself, hubby got a smokehouse burger and the kid had the corn dogs and fruit. My sandwich was just plain gross and I'm not really sure how you mess up bread, fried chicken and hot sauce -- but they did. It was tasteless, soggy within moments and unpleasant. The smokehouse burger was decent, although a side of avocado was 3 dollars. And the corn dogs seemed like they were great, but the side of fruit was OLD and SOGGY and literally looked like it sat in a bowl for a week we commented on it and the waitress offered us fries instead, which we declined (kind of defeats the purpose of giving your kid something nutritional with his deep fried hot dogs). For dessert we ordered the White Chocolate Rasp Cheesecake and a Lemoncello Cake -- Both were FANTASTIC.  Overall though, the food was terrible especially for how pricey this establishment is. 80% of the time we were looking for our waitress for sauce or refills or to order something - even desert took 15 minutes to get out to us. In addition, my husband ended up getting sick and was up all night in the bathroom, which we should have expected from how poorly our food tasted.

We came in a big group the last time we were here and it was great. The staff is awesome and friendly. We came on a Wednesday night and it was busy. Man was I glad we got our table reserved.  Also when we were waiting to be seated, we got there a bit early, I noticed the cheesecakes in the display case and man did they look good. I also noticed that people were just lining up to just get cheesecake. I was surprised and never really had their cheesecake there. So I decided to try their cheesecake after dinner. I will talk about that after I talk about the Kobe beef burger with mushrooms. It was good! I would definitely recommend that burger. Now if you don't like mushrooms that's fine because I don't like them either but there I was eating mushrooms. Well, I don't dislike mushrooms but I think the mushrooms add a good flavor to the burger. The fries are good too.  Now let's get back to the cheesecake. We had the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake and man it went down very easy. Between my wife and I we ate it very quickly. I almost want to get another or try another cheesecake. It was very good. I now realized why people were lining up just for the cheesecake, it was good! I yearn for this cheesecake sometimes. It's embarrassing I know but I do. I also yearn for the Kobe Burger too.

I really only truly like the Godiva dark chocolate cheesecake, but 5-6 slices of it seemed a little much. So we had a light bite after golf.  After7 pm seems like a better time, just at the tail end of the rush. We waited only 5 minutes for a table. Service was prompt. Food took just a bit longer than expected, probably because we were so hungry. Then menu, as everyone knows is abut lengthy. Hubby tried the chicken Alfredo, which was enough for two meals at $16. It was a bit garlicky. I tried a couple of small plates for $7 each- stuffed tater tots and crab balls. Both ok but just nothing wow about them, lacked seasoning.  The restaurant seemed very clean. The patio in the afternoon sun would be quite warm.  The slices of Godiva cake I took home did not disappoint.

The service has been ok to great and the food usually good to excellent.  When we've had any type of issue the manager has been quick to comp a meal.  A few days ago friends were needing to finish up some shopping at the Mall and we planned to meet for lunch.  Neither had been to the Cheesecake Factory. I thought perfect, something for everybody and right in the Mall. This is the first time I've come here with small children; infant and 4 year old, both very well behaved. We're told there will be 20 minute wait until we're able to be seated.  I stated there are 3 adults and two children. The hostess says ""5 then"". We think, OK not too bad, lets make a bathroom run, check out the menu, shouldn't be too difficult even when having to stand in the middle of everything with two small children.  35 minutes later we were seated. At a booth without a highchair, we have to stop somebody and ask for a high chair. We wait some more they finally bring a high chair.  Within a reasonable amount of time we're given drinks and our order is taken...We order three interesting appetizers to share and a childrens grilled cheese. 45 minutes later the first human interaction from any staff is the manager who peaks around the corner of our booth apologizing for the delay in getting our order. The order arrives while he's making some sort of explanation and we're finally asked if our drinks need refilling.  There is no grilled cheese for the kids. 10 minutes later a dried out, sandwich with not melted cheese shows up. The Spring Roll and the Avocado Egg Rolls were excellent. The Artichoke Crab Dip was disgusting. It was fishing, oily, and slightly burnt. I had fully expected to have at least one item credited off the bill.  The bill showed up with everything included to the tune of $65.00 I briefly looked for the manager  again, but he was nowhere to be found and we were more than ready to be gone. Needless to say my friends won't be coming back after this experience. I will not be recommending it to anybody with children, and might not be in any hurry to go back myself.

I ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta for $17.95.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious.  My gripe? The shrimp! I got 4 medium sized shrimp and what looked like 1.5 pounds of pasta on my plate.  For $17.95, I would expect way more shrimp!  The only redeeming thing about this trip was the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake.   I'm from the east coast, we love TCF there!

Waiting and service wasn't bad even with a lot of parties tonight. We got seated at a very small table which didn't have enough space to even put the appetizer plate with two waters and some utensils. It was literally more like a table for one instead of two. This location is really crowded, the server had to squeeze in between tables to get orders and refill drinks. Whoever came up with the idea to put the Cheesecake Factory here didn't put much thought into how crowded and small the location is.  Every page on the menu has ""Specialities"" on the top which made the menu not so special. We were kind of expecting a small section of special menu but nope. There were a lot of varieties to choose from though. We had the fried calamari as appetizer and that was delicious. It was light & crispy & it came with two different dipping sauces. For entrees, bf got the chicken Romano & I got the factory combo of shrimp scampi & steak Diane. Both of our entrees lacked flavors & presentation. I asked for medium well for my steak but it came out to be burnt & overcooked. Overall, the entrees were horrible.

Also, as a small side note, it looked like someone had sneezed milk all over the wall at our booth??? The Cheesecake Factory is not one of the cleaner places I have dined at. The food was a solid ""meh."" My fries tasted stale and the burger had soggy buns and bland meat. It wasn't horrible, but I've experienced much better at much cheaper venues. Maybe the Cheesecake Factory should cut down on the menu size and improve the food quality? I'm not sure. We had to ask the waitress for drink refills several times, as she rarely visited our table (the manager brought us our meals and another waitress brought us our dessert). We had to wait around 15 minutes to get our dessert and only after mentioning the wait to the manager did we get it. We waited even longer to get our check and even longer after that to get the credit card returned. We felt very ignored by our waitress. The manager was very nice and is the only reason I didn't rate the Cheesecake Factory one star. Their ice cream and cheesecake are pretty good too!

We walked in on a Sunday night to put our name in.  ""30 minutes"" she said.  ""Cool"" we said.  ""What's your phone number?"" She said.  ""775-999-4444"" I said.  ""Name?"" she said.  ""Kiwi"" I said.

Then came the dessert!!  Ooooh la la!!  It was my wife's birthday weekend so she picked the Reeses Cheesecake.  I took one bite and spit it out.  My wife and daughter almost finished the single piece.  But even one bite was too much for me.  Sugar death incarnate.  The service on this evening was not so harried as just not really organized.  Most of the staff wasn't running around all stressed but they weren't hitting any spots that they should have hit.   So in closing, our preparations were helpful in some ways and other ways we were over prepared.  Next time we go in, I am sure the experience will be different.  That happens when you have a chain restaurant experience.  Because staff never can stay. One warning...most people who are into food have come to understand ""Factory"" as a bad descriptor.  You might want to turn that little warning light off when you go in....because they use the name ""Factory"" on everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=80
Ernie C.,"Portland, OR",268,414,431,3.0,8/30/2014,"Stopped in on a Sunday night.  Decor is standard Cheesecake Factory - big, a little bit opulent and over the top.  A considerable build out from when it was 775 Gastropub, especially with the large patio. We checked in at the host stand, where they told us it'd be about a half hour wait, and asked for our phone number to text us.  They print off a little receipt/ticket deal, that has the estimated time that says to be in the area.  I wonder what they'd do if you didn't have a cell phone or text messaging? So, we wandered aimlessly around the mall for a bit, killing some time, and wandered back.  The receipt had said 6:30, we got the text around 6:43, so a little bit off but no big deal. I hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in 10 years or so (back in Chicago), and the GF had never been.  GF was a little overwhelmed by the menu, which is quite the tome.  I ended up ordered the Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira combo for $20 while she got the Pear and Blue Cheese flat bread for $7.  I remember thinking the prices seemed high when I went 10 years ago, but these prices seemed pretty reasonable to me.  Not sure if it's their price point that's changed, my disposable income, or maybe some combination of the two. The steak and chicken were actually surprisingly decent.  I ordered the steak medium rare, and the chunks of beef were cooked appropriately, while the chicken breast was cooked correctly and very tender.  The miss here would be that while the proteins were well prepared, the mushrooms that topped both were lukewarm at best.  Both were covered in overwhelming sauces with decent flavor, but definitely designed to cover up any inconsistencies and definite salt bombs.  I think the entree was fair for the price. We got the 30th anniversary cheesecake to go ($8).  I'm not a big dessert person, but it seemed decent to me, albeit a bit airy.  The GF mentioned she didn't like the texture either, and prefers the cheesecake at Manhattan Deli (a much denser affair). Our server Allyson was attentive, competent, and prompt - while the service didn't stand out, it speaks well for her and their training considering the newness of the restaurant. Overall, a solid chain dining experience.  If friends were saying to pick a chain restaurant to eat at, I think I'd lean towards Cheesecake Factory, as long as we had the time to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=80

The staff here is really nice, and always incredible pleasant! This last trip here my mom and I both ordered mojitos (her a regular one, and me a blueberry one) and they were phenomenal. Only I problem was they took a little long to make! That's fine though, I was amongst good company. I ordered the lemon-garlic shrimp which is just phenomenal, truly tastes so good! My mom ordered the grilled steak medallions and she really enjoyed it as well. My only complaint ever about the Cheesecake Factory is the fact that everything takes awhile to come out!

And they did a good job at it. The menu is huge and has a large variety of entrées. The food is average with a few really good items here and there. The service is great. I dined with four 12-15 year olds that did their best to behave like humans , but were unsuccessful 30% of the time. Despite that the staff were great and provided great service.

Justine F.,"Reno, NV",303,125,337,3.0,8/26/2014,"We must have come on a good night because the wait was merely 20 minutes for dinner. We got right in and sat at a table inside. Our waitress said that the wait time has been 2 hrs at a time. I really wish that they would have made the restaurant bigger on the inside, which may be one of the reasons that the wait time is so long. Plus, it is a new restaurant. I have always loved The Cheesecake Factory. I think that it is one of the better chain restaurants around America. You can't beat the 20 million page menu. There are so many options! Plus, the cheesecake is always delicious. I am curious if they ship it in or bake it fresh daily? I started out with a mint green iced tea and my boyfriend had a lemonade. The presentation was wonderful. The ice tea came with a mint leaf inside the glass and the lemonade has a rim lined with sugar. They both were good. Our fresh, hot baked bread came right away.  My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Bellagio and I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta dish. Both dishes were huge portions that we both took home leftovers for lunch the next day. I loved Evelyn's Favorite. It came with a bounty of fresh vegetables, such as zucchini, eggplant, and tomatoes. It even had olives and pine nuts in it. The sauce is a pesto based sauce. Afterwards, we ordered the banana creme cheesecake. It was a hit!!! SO GOOD! Beware how tasty this cheesecake is. It was like the pie in cheesecake form.

Compensation for our now less than stellar luke warm meals was never made.  After these last two visits I honestly get the impression that this local Cheesecake Factory has developed the attitude that they are loved by everyone and for that reason they no longer have to try.  Minimal effort is acceptable.  All in all,  this has been two straight disappointing experiences.   I gave two stars because the food is actually good.  You just have to get past the bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=80

We went in after lunch rush and we're seated immediately. Our hostess was the most bubbly, energetic young man. When I told him we had never been there he got so excited and was so passionate about his job.  The server came over and seemed irritated from the start. After looking over the menu and being completely overwhelmed I had questions. I asked what the Luau salad was and she was like it's just layered with lettuce then carrots. I was like ok. What about the chicken almond salad is it just breast meat? Deep sigh and further frustration - I don't know it's just chicken like tuna salad. I found our hostess and after I explained all this he was mortified. I explained I could not alert the manager because my elderly mother was getting upset and I didn't want her to know that I was even talking to him. He tried his best to help me.  For the record the Luau salad was layered with crisp won tons, salad, carrots, pineapple, macadamia nuts, chicken, sesame seeds and a very lite, sweet dressing. Mother's sandwich didn't even gave the dressing nicely mixed it was just glopped on and she said it was very hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=80

Portions were large and the price is fair. We had the Cuban sandwich and the fish tacos.

Yesterday evening my dad treated my family to dinner and I was so excited I was going to try it out!  Upon walking in I as astounded by how absolutely gorgeous it was. The waiter was beyond friendly, really, he was such a jokester. I do appreciate good humor! I also have a soft spot for waiters that recognize that we have young children and they get the orders in for them right away! My eldest son ordered the mini corndogs with fruit and my youngest ordered pizza. Each of them thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I was surprised that the mini corndogs came with the sticks in them. It was so cute! The child's pizza was huge! So huge that my dad and brother also had a piece. Everyone thought it was delicious!   I ordered the Kale & Quinoa Salad and added some grilled chicken. It was A-MAZ-ING! There was a wonderful combination of lemon dressing, sweet red peppers, grapes, and parmesan with each and every bite. My husband had the pulled pork burger that he said was awesome! My dad ordered the herb-crusted salmon with steak Diane and garlic mashed potatoes. The salmon was so fresh and full of flavor ( I tried a bite). My brother ordered the same except chicken in place of the salmon. I was impressed with the flavor that each meal brought!  For desert we ordered a red velvet and strawberry cheesecake to share. I could not believe the size of the slices! Boy was I glad that we were sharing! The red   velvet cheesecake was layers of red velvet cake and then cheesecake with white chocolate shavings on the back. The red velvet cake was so moist and really blended well with the cheesecake. I did not try the strawberry cheesecake, but the strawberries were huge and looked fresh! My brother and father finished it all, so I figure that that says a lot!

Yes. My suggestion if you can afford it and it's worth it, BUY the WHOLE fricken cake! instead of slices. I am going to dock 1 star off this place for service. While food and cake are super deliciously expensive, they need to back it up with some good service. Something I expect when my bill is going to be astronomical.

In fact I only saw her 2 times the entire meal to take our order and then give us the check, then after boxing our leftovers and handing each of us our separate bags she handed us the wrong leftovers, which I found out after getting home.

It is located in the mall but they have an outdoor entrance from the parking lot which makes it really easy to access and the sign is red and HUGE so you can't miss it. The ambiance is lovely.  Warm hues of maroon and gold surround the room.  The hostess counter is black and commanding of your attention as you enter.  We were greeted by a friendly man who directed a hostess to seat us.  It was very busy which is to be expected considering it was prime time for lunch. I enjoyed my very large ""lunch sized"" Cobb Salad.  My husband got the ""Italian"" with fries.  We also got the Artichoke/Crab Dip.  All three items were awesome.  If I had to find a complaint it would be that The Cheesecake Factory serves fries in a cylinder cone type thing with the fries pointed up (as is trending) and it made it hard for my husband to eat his sandwich without his wrist knocking into them.  It's more comical than a complaint though. The best part about this place hands down was our waiter Jacob.  He was stellar.  Our drinks were never empty.  He was attentive and got everything we needed without smothering us. He had wonderful energy and he seemed really happy to be working.  If I could purchase a shrinking ray and shrink him I would totally do it.  I'd keep him in my purse and every time we went out to eat I would un-shrink him so we could have the best waiter ever.  He was that good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=140

It's because after Legends and Summit mall were built and Park Lane mall was demolish,  Meadowood Mall inherited the titled of being the ""trash mall"" That's why they added Coach, Forever 21, Cheesecake Factory and did some remodeling to avoid that reputation.  I would put this place in the same caliber as BJ's Brewery.  Its menu is enormous, they try and do ""everything"".  This has it's drawbacks.

My 30 year old boring white collared chubby ass also likes staring at the hot 20something college guys working here.  So far I've had these cheesecakes: 1. white chocolate raspberry- amazing and not as rich as other cheesecakes 2. cookie dough- good but I probably wouldn't get again 3. oreo- excellent but a little rich 4. lemon raspberry- good but could have used more raspberry  5. aaron's peanut butter cup- so far my favorite!! i love the peanut butter mousse; the only thing is the girl at the bakery section gave me a tiny slice. wtf? 6. chris's something cheesecake- very good and i would get this again but it was the same girl at the bakery so she gave me yet another tiny slice and she wouldn't give me a fork until i asked! watch out for this tattooed girl who always wears bright red lipstick. she's cheap!! 7. Oreo 8. Oreo again I think? 9.  10.  11. 12.  13.  14.  15.  16.  17. 18.  19.  20.  To be continued",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=160
Stephanie C.,"Sparks, NV",351,353,555,3.0,10/15/2014,"I have only eaten here once and I hope to upgrade the stars when I visit again.  We came here about two months after the place opened.  That should give them enough time to work out the kinks. I can't complain about the food.  It was pretty darn good.  We ordered the chicken popper appetizer and it was SO dang good!  If you haven't tried that then you must.  It was worth going back for.  My companions ordered a burger and a chicken pasta dish.  We were all pleased with the food.   The reason behind the three star review was the service.  It took forever to even be acknowledged.  Once we were acknowledged it took a really long time to get our drinks.  Once we got the food served they committed the cardinal sin of serving (in my opinion) in that they gave us our food and walked away leaving us with zero napkins or utensils.  UGH!  One of my biggest pet peeves.  Once we flagged someone down for utensils and napkins we were again ignored for a while.  We split a cheesecake for desert and it was so good.  Then all of a sudden when the bill shows up we get the most attentive and cheerful server all of a sudden.  Wow really?  Where were you during the past hour?   Like I said, I do hope to upgrade the stars when I come back to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=160
Laurie H.,"Springtown, TX",6,95,41,1.0,3/28/2015,We gave them another try. The food was really bad and overpriced this time. The menu changed and the prices went up and the item we wanted to order has been removed from the new menu. So we ordered from the lunch menu. Who serves a mixed up Cobb salad drenched in ranch dressing? It looked like it had already been eaten. Nasty. Sent it back. Waitress was wonderful about it all. Fried mac n cheese was really good and my sons Oreo Shake was great too! It will be a very long time til we return to this store at this location.

The hostess greeted us, said the wait was 5-10 minutes and gave us a pager to hold, never once looking up from her phone. Suddenly the place was filling up and people that came in after us were being seated. After almost 20 minutes, my friend approached her to see what was taking so long. She informed us that perhaps our pager was broken and we should have been paying closer attention.  We were seated immediately without an apology. The food was mediocre at best; the sandwich bread was stale, the fries were burnt,  the butter frozen.  Rachael was our server and only because if her, am I giving this review 3 stars.

The salmon has a nice crusty browness to it.  I dislike mushy fishso i was pleased with this dish. The pesto-type sauce had a nice flavor and texture.    Then there was the cheesecake.   I love lemon pie and cheesecake so why not combin the two and have lemon meringue cheesecake.  Awesome.   Great lemon flavor and the meringe toppiig was a nice touch.

Johnny B.,"Reno, NV",57,362,76,3.0,11/12/2014,"Seating was available immediately on a Friday evening around 6 so we didn't need to make a reservation. That surprised us. The patio is heated so there was the option to sit outside or inside, it was breezy outside so we opted for inside. The first thing I noticed was the size of the menu. It was THICK! But after browsing though it, there are a lot of advertisements. Too many for such a classy establishment. They did have a large selection of food. But the quality was lacking on both of our dishes. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It was served as a couple large chunks of pork, which I had to pull/shred myself. It had ok flavor and they served it with a side of bbq sauce so you could add to your liking. I upgraded to sweet potato fries which were tasty but they forgot to bring them with our food and instead brought out regular fries. I had to remind them and they brought out the sweet potato ones. She ordered the Italian sandwich, which had good flavor but the bread was so hard and overtoasted it was inedible.  Cheesecake selections are enormous. We decided to share the white chocolate macadamia nut. Abnormal from anything else I can remember when ordering a macadamia nut dish, this one was LOADED with macadamia nuts!! I was really hoping for a 4-5 star experience here but they fell short.  The cheesecake was the only saving grace on this trip.

Louis D.,"Reno, NV",72,323,87,2.0,8/13/2014,"There was a time when Paris Hilton was cool.  There was a time when people emulated hedge fund billionaires and Bentleys.  There was a time when women asked you what labels you were wearing, and you thought it was cool wearing Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Boss, Guess.  There was a time when driving a Hummer and living in the suburbs and hanging out at malls charging everything and eating at big name chains was cool.  Yes, there was a time when being a corporate lackey dumbsh t was cool, because like everyone was doing it.  Cheesecake Factory was the ultimate high end chain restaurant during those asinine days hanging out at South Coast Plaza getting your car valeted and eating at Wolfgang Puck's.  I've been to Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto, Newport Beach, Roseville, and Waikiki.  I'm not saying this to brag.  I'm saying it, because I used to be an asinine brand-chasing, corporate lackey moron.  That was before the Great Oil Wars and the Great Recession, and people began to realize that the excessive consumption bubble was an illusion, just borrowing time on a big bomb, a Ponzi scheme.  Millennials have a lot to complain about, but even today, it doesn't seem to have gotten through to them.  They're really screwed.  They'll be paying the rest of their lives for the excessive consumption of Baby Boomers and Gen X'ers who ate at Cheesecake Factory, got their arteries clogged, and need million dollar healthcare while they sit on their fat pensions paid for by none-other than Millennials earning lower pay.  If Millennials were not so caught up in social media and self-congratulatory self-promoting electronic sharing, they'd pick up guns and not just occupy sh t like passive, peasant squatters but overthrow sh t like pissed off revolutionaries.   Until that day, they can eat cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory, sort of a mausoleum of everything that went wrong in the 90's and early 00's.  For me, it's nostalgic.  I've been to this chain with many family and friends especially out of country to show off how Americans do upscale, excessive calorie-chain restaurants like no other nation.  I like the fried tapas/appetizers.  They must have two hundred items on their menus including flatbreads, exotic eggrolls, pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, salads, seafood, pasta, and $20 steaks.  How can they afford $20 steaks?  Well, they're factory, grain-fed sick cows, that's how.  You get sick here, not only from the grease and fat but also the unnaturally raised meats.  The Reno incarnation of calorifically fried gluttony is the smallest version I've been to, and the large glass windows exposing the Forever 21 sign undermines the upscale décor reminding you that you're in some cheesy shopping mall.  The service was outstanding, even though they were packed.  I can only imagine, most of the people were from California and were reminiscing and probably the exact same people who lined up for blocks when In'n'Out opened.  But that's what this is, reminiscing and nostalgia.  I had a roommate who liked to eat baby food.  Now, that's taking nostalgia to the extreme, although arguably, many of us still drink milk.  I'm probably only going to come here once a year for sake of nostalgia, just like I'll hit up Fatburger probably only once a year or have a McRib once a year.  You can't deny that you had some good times back in the day and certain things, albeit unhealthy for you today, help bring back some good memories, but if you really want to do yourself and the world a favor, I'd stick with the local restaurants that serve healthier food without the preservatives, GMO, antibiotics (which will eventually kill us all by creating superbugs), and growth hormones (which make men grow boobs and women grow facial hair).  Unless you've been living under a rock the last decade or perhaps been living only in Reno and not getting out much, you'll think this place is the bee's knees and you'll also try to get people to call the area south of downtown Reno, SODO, because, you know, you're a friggin, clueless, corporate lackey moron still living in the 90's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=180

Jeff D.,"Reno, NV",1,27,,2.0,8/20/2014,"We've always loved The Cheesecake Factory and always seem to find one when we're traveling. Recently, this one opened in Reno, where we live, and we were excited. We knew there would be a long wait. There always seems to be a wait at any Cheesecake Factory location. We were quoted a 60-80 minute wait when we got to this location. I took one look around and saw that this location is TINY...and horribly cramped! Now why in the world, in a tourist city near Lake Tahoe, would they build such a tiny location? Granted the mall might regulate it, but then build somewhere else! As we left to go into the mall to shop, I immediately noticed there are not near enough seats for people waiting. People were standing in or very near the dining area, which is highly inappropriate. The food was great as always, but we kept having to wait exceptionally long for drink refills. They had one person on either end of the dining area overlooking the area, presumably to assist with anything as needed, but they never refilled drinks. One of them, obviously an idiot who has no sense of personal space, kept walking by our bar style table and getting too close. It's hard to explain, but whenever she walked by our table, she looked right at us, like she was worried we were going to steal something. At one moment, I thought she was going to kiss me LoL I understand this is a very new location, but it was not planned out well at all. They are going to lose money because people don't like long waits, and that will continue until people just stop showing up. This location should have been three times the size it is, and they should utilize their staff appropriately and train them on manners.

They bring in corporate openers/managers, their total system is installed, and that's is how it is. Day one. The inability of the computerized system to estimate seating time isn't going to get better (well, people will stop coming). And it is absolutely not OK for it to be so far off. The food is fine. The servers were all nice. The renovation of the space is nice-- the outdoor seating especially. After a 2.5 hour wait, wildly underestimated by the system, the whole damn meal should have been comped, AND it should have  been food of the gods. Our server was awfully sorry everything took so long, and nothing was done to compensate for our time. And it wasn't food of the gods.

Then my son said they are ready to sit us down. Not really thou, now we are waiting by the hostes table behind 2 more couples. I told the lady I was more comfortable sitting at the bar than standing in another line. She smiled and said not too much longer. I forgot I'm getting the thrill of getting the chance to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. We get to go to our table and it was where the screened in area is, I seen 9 empty tables and asked the lady sitting U.S. Why are people waiting when there are tables here. She gave me the cheesecake smile and said we are doing the best we can. Then before I could settle my but cheeks into the seat a waitress comes by and said can I help you? She is standing there with the lady that just sat us down. I said we just sat down give us a minute, this time I did not get the cheesecake smile and concluded I pissed her off. Oh well. I think the illusion of a waiting line is suppose to give you the idea of a great place to eat and while you wait you get to buy expensive drinks. Why else would there have been 9 empty tables when we were being seated. Restaurant trickery I think. I use to deliver food to restaurants for 11 years and I know some of there tricks, a common one is they will buy smaller plates for the illusion of a lot of food another one is thick glass for your drinks. It is still 8 ounces but looks like a quart. I will say the food was very good. Portions were good. I will also say if there is a waiting line I will turn and go some place else.

Rick G.,"Reno, NV",8,33,6,2.0,12/18/2015,Took my nephew and niece here on a Sunday afternoon just before five and was told there would be a thirty minute wait unless we wanted to eat outside on patio - we opted to wait and sit inside but when they texted us to sit down the hostess walked us out to the outside patio - rather than get angry we just sat down and made the best of it - the waitress took over ten minutes to even acknowledge us - I had the meatloaf which was very salty but was served hot - the service was sub par at best and the Resturant wasn't very clean especially the floors - this was my first experience at the RENO location and was not like the other locations I have been to (salt lake city + San Francisco) it will be awhile before I try this place again - the value for what you pay seemed a bit high to me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=180
Shelby B.,"Sparks, NV",62,161,14,3.0,9/29/2014,"Let's get this out of the way - three stars is not bad.   I went in with a poor attitude to begin with as Cheesecake seemed to push out a local restaurant.  Fight the man, and all.   However, service was very good and our lunch of flat bread pizza was just fine.  I do feel they have the tables way to close together, so conversations might was well be shared with the people next to you.  All and all though, that is my only complaint.

Alyss E.,"Carson City, NV",0,1,,1.0,2/20/2017,"HORRIBLE!!!!  This was the biggest waste of 2.5 hours I have ever spent... 1) We were told it was a 15  minute wait for our table and it was 30 minutes. 2) Our waiter came to give us menus and we wanted to place a drink order.  He said, I'll bring waters and then we can order... so we waited... for waters... 3) about 10 minutes later... our waiter returned and asked if we were ready to order.  Sure... he went to my mom first, then I placed mine and as soon as I stated my lunch order he asked my sister what she wanted to order... well, I wanted a drink order.. AS WE STATED WHEN THE WAITER FIRST APPROACHED US!... 4) our table waited AT LEAST 20 minutes before the waiter came back and told us that the bar was ""on it"" and our drinks will be up soon... 5) I ordered the Blood Orange Martini and it was served in a tall glass.... WTF am I ordering a MARTINI that is NOT being served in a MARTINI GLASS!? 5) Our food was FINALLY served to us...  mine and mom's... but no one else from our party... a few minutes later came my sister's and my fiancee's... and then a few minutes AFTER THAT came my grandmother's and father's! 6) When I looked at my pasta dish (the Farfalle something or other) it looked like it had a coating of wax over it.  I asked my sister (who also works SI) and she said that it looked like it sat under the heat lamp for about an hour (about how long we were waiting for our food, coincidence?) 7) My  fiancee ordered his burger ""medium"".  The waiter said ""some pink?"" Sure...  But when it came... RED... BLOODY... GROSS! 8)At that point my one year old was ""being a one year old"" and was getting fussy so I decided to take him out of the restaurant before he disturbed other diners... So I didn't even get to experience the rest of the shitty experience that my family told me about later.  Apparently, my grandmother's meal was comped because although she was adamant about no mayonnaise on her sandwich, it was still included.  But that was no excuse for the absolute shit show that occurred today.  I will NEVER return!

S. B.,"Reno, NV",0,9,,1.0,3/15/2015,"All the hype about this place from my friends, I had to try it, since I've never been to one ever. Well, first visit, they screwed up on my pasta scampi, which I asked for no tomatoes on it and it was all over my plate when I received it. The server apologized and had them make me a new one. That came and it was so so SALTY, but no tomatoes. The mngr came over and asked if everything was good now and I said no. I can't eat it because it's so salty. She apologized and said they probably had to much salt in the water when they cooked the pasta. I decided to skip the pasta and order the Fish and Chips which was pretty good. However, the fries were burnt and the server even noticed it when she brought it out and asked if I wanted new ones. I said no, since I had been waiting a long time at this point because of the pasta fiasco. I just ate the fish.  So a month later my husband wanted to try this place. He ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger ""medium"" cooked. It came out RAW. They took it back since he only took one bite and they brought him the same burger. By the time the burger came back, I was already done with my meal. The mngr on duty had the nerve to tell my husband that in the future ask for it ""Medium Well"" and it will come out ""Medium"". Really? How about working out the kinks of your kitchen where the food is good and consistent each and everytime. We could have easily paid $5+ (ala carte) at 5 Guys up the street for a COOKED burger and saved $8, since the burger was like $13 bucks. Poor quality of food and managers aren't customer service oriented.  This place is OVER EXPENSIVE for the quality of food they serve.

I ordered the orange chicken. Well I took two bites and packed it up to take have and fix it up. I offered Gus a bite and he just laughed and said no thinks, looks dry. Boy was it dry.

Kim J.,"Sparks, NV",0,18,,5.0,10/4/2015,"My family and I dined here for my birthday.  It was the first time we had dined at The Cheesecake Factory and it was not disappointing! My parents arrived first to secure a table as they do not take reservations.  They waited for about 10 minutes and were seated about 7:30pm.  My husband and I arrived a short while later. The menu is extensive.  It almost makes it overwhelming to try and decide what to order especially if it is your first visit.  Then they have a whole separate menu with healthier, lighter fare on it.  If you have room for dessert, or just come for the cheesecake, that portion of the menu will require some perusing before making your decision too!   I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  It was awesome!  It was very flavorful and moist, and everyone I shared a bite with agreed.  I would love to have the recipe to recreate at home.  It was even good the next day for lunch.  The portions here are huge (similar to the large portions at Claim Jumper).  My entree included 4 small, thin cut chicken breasts plus at least a cup of mashed potatoes and some green beans.  My husband ordered a turkey sandwich with a salad from the lighter fare menu, my dad had a Tuscan pasta dish, and my mom had another pasta dish which they all seemed to enjoy as well. We managed to save room for dessert, but even part of that went home in to go boxes!  My dad ordered the classic cheesecake with berries on top, I had the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake, my husband had a four layer chocolate cake that was so rich it took him three days to finish it, and my mom had another one of the cheesecake choices.  We all enjoyed our desserts, and I highly recommend the Reese's Peanut Butter cheesecake if you like peanut butter and chocolate. Our waitress was attentive, very cordial, and quite knowledgable about the menu.  The restaurant was quite elegant even though it is part of Meadowood Mall.  It looks nothing like the one portrayed on the show ""The Big Bang Theory"".  :)  The prices are higher than the average restauant, but the food quality and portion size are excellent, and the cheesecake alone is worth a visit.  The service was great and the ambience is very nice.  I hate having ""Happy Birthday"" sang to me, but they will do so if you request it.  Thank you for an enjoyable birthday evening, Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=200

Sarah G.,"Henderson, NV",0,18,1,1.0,6/24/2016,"This review is only for the one located in Reno NV. I just moved here from Las Vegas and would frequent the Cheesecake Factory there. I love it and couldn't get enough of it. On my birthday, Anniversary, kids birthdays, husbands birthday, Mother's Day and so on, I would get a slice of cheesecake and it was so big it would last me two days. When I went to the one in Reno it was so small that I finished it in 6 bites, no joke. $8 for a tinny piece of cake!!! The staff is rude at the Reno Location as well. I wasn't greeting with a smiling face but with a simple Hi, what would you like to drink. I asked how much an extra side would be of something and my waitress said I don't know then said want anything else. After my meal I waiting 20mins for my check to find out it wasn't even my bill that was given to me so I had to wait another 10 mins to get the right one. It was very disappointing but I saw the light of going home and eating my cake to find out how small it was. I love the Cheesecake Factory but this location is horrible. I would say save your time and money and go somewhere else. There are lots of other amazing places to eat in town.

My first reaction of the restaurant is typical and nice ambiance/decorating, but i was surprised how relatively small it is inside. The service was borderline terrible. Just a ridiculous wait time from ordering until the food was served. I would guess somewhere around 40 minutes, maybe longer. No excuse for that. The real disappointment came with the food however. Having tried the Baja Chicken Tacos numerous times in Vegas, that is what I ordered, and these were nothing like what I was used to, and really were not very good.

When the manager (Joe) heard of our mishap he came over and very kindly greeted us and apologized. Already better service than we have experienced other places. But not only that he boxed our leftovers, brought our check and removed everything except the appetizer! We were blown out of the water with his generosity! It really made our night out special. When these are far and few between it sucks when things don't go as planned, but he took it into his control and made our night. So kudos to you Joe! Thank you for being kind, personable, and humble!

Carla M.,"Sparks, NV",2,33,7,3.0,9/26/2014,"Let me start by saying that the cheesecake is AMAZING! Maybe this restaurant should just be a bakery, because the actual entrees were underwhelming. It gets 3 stars because of their stellar selection of delicious cheesecake, and because the staff was very fast & friendly. I love that they have special parking for those who place takeout orders, and then deliver the order right to your car.   We originally thought the entrees had very reasonable prices - but judging by the quality of the food, they might be a bit over priced. I got the Chicken Bellagio and my boyfriend got the Meatloaf Entrée. The portions are gigantic, so at least you get a lot of food for the price, but the quality isn't so great. The ""crispy coated chicken breast"" I received was soggy and didn't have much flavor. Also, the menu says it comes with parmesan cream sauce pasta.  We ordered for take-out so maybe they forgot to include the cream sauce? In any case, the pasta just tasted like it was dipped in olive oil and sprinkled with parmesan. The Meatloaf had pretty good flavor, but it was spicy. My boyfriend hates spicy food, so it would be nice if they put a warning on the menu next to foods that will be spicy. He ordered a rather pricy side salad, which disappointingly consisted of a small handful of lettice, 1 slice of tomato, and ranch dressing.  The real joke was the appetizer! We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and it was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. So ridiculous, in fact, that I had to take a picture. For seven bucks, we received 5.2 miniature mushrooms with stuffing that tasted like someone took a blow-torch to the top. Stuffed mushrooms are one of my top favorite appetizers, so I order them at any restaurant where they're available. These were the most pathetic little chunks of food I've ever eaten. I almost channeled my inner Gordon Ramsey, and had visions of throwing them against a wall in disgust.   For dessert, we got the S'Mores cheesecake, which is drool-worthy. It has a graham cracker crust, with chocolate ganache and fluffy marshmallow on top. Probably the best cheesecake I've ever had! The serving size is huge. We both had three little bites and had to take the rest home. All in all, I would return to this restaurant again, but probably just for the cheesecake. We have a family luncheon scheduled there for next week, so I'll get to taste a different entrée and see if it's any better than my first go-around. Maybe I'll tell my least liked family member to order the stuffed mushrooms :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=220

Ken L.,"Reno, NV",7,23,7,3.0,6/22/2015,My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner and it was super busy.  They were low on waitresses but they still got us seated right away.  We were waiting for our food for quite a while and soon we started to realize that everyone around us was getting their food before us.  No one had stopped to see how we were doing and finally we had to get the waitresses attention and she said oh I thought you already got your food.  She soon brought us our food.

Brit Y.,"Reno, NV",2,9,2,3.0,2/11/2015,"My Mom and I decided to try out The Cheesecake Factory since we've enjoyed the Roseville location a lot. For being extremely busy on a Sunday the wait time was very quick. We were told 10 minutes and we were seated before the 10 minutes were up. While waiting my mother used the restroom and she said they were extremely dark. The way the hostess calls you up to be seated we had to wait for someone else to come seat us which was odd to us. We were seated at the tables that are half booth, half chairs. That part is fine but the spacing of the tables weren't spaced evenly and the table next to us was right there, we could hear their entire conversation. It felt like we were squished in the corner and they just tried to squeeze us in. The waitress kept squeezing into the small gap between the table next to us and ours. It was extremely awkward and unappetizing while we were eating with her butt inches away from our food. I wish I thought to take a picture of the tight fit. My Mom had to block the bread with her had so it didn't get hit.  On the plus side the food was delicious. We shared the crab cake bites, mushroom, avocado, zucchini fries and split their bacon BBQ burger. We didn't care for any of the side sauces that accompanied each dish. We asked for sides of ranch and bleu cheese. Both the dressing were very good.  Overall.. if it wasn't for the good food, we would not go back. Next time a booth will be requested.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=220
Z N.,"Reno, NV",0,24,1,5.0,2/18/2015,"Great food.  It goes against everything I think a restaurant can do successfully, but does it perfectly.  Usually if I see an extensive menu at a restaurant I immediately know that I am probably in for a mediocre meal, but the Cheesecake Factory has changed my belief in that.  We have been there half a dozen times and no one in my family has had a bad meal yet and it has one of the most extensive menus I've ever seen.  They have a fantastic separate healthy menu with wonderful dishes that will fill you up.  The service is great and the deserts, especially if you are a cheesecake fan, are unbelievably good.  My one complaint, which is really a testament to how good this place is, is that there is often a long wait, so either go in an off time or when you don't mind looking around Meadowood Mall while you wait for their text to be seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=220
Scott T.,"INCLINE VLG, NV",0,3,,2.0,8/6/2015,"Met a couple friends for dinner last night and was excited that there was finally a Cheesecake Factories in Reno. I have been to many others and always enjoyed them. Unfortunately, that was not the case with this visit. I have not had such a bad restaurant experience in a long time. Now, I know mistakes happen and nobody is perfect, but when the service is bad and then the food is bad, its inexcusable.   I arrived and found my friends already seated. Our waitress promptly came to the table and asked if we were ready to order, I just sat down. She took our drink order and upon delivering the drinks, asked if we were ready to order. She came back 3 times in less than 5 minutes to ask if we were ready to order. Apparently, she had asked my friend multiple times if she was ready to order even before we got there. I like the enthusiastic approach, but seriously, give me time to read the encyclopedia sized menu. I ordered the eggplant parmesan, my favorite, and substituted plain pasta with marinara instead of the pesto pasta. One friend ordered a breakfast plate and the other, fettuccini alfredo with chicken. When our food arrived, I had the wrong pasta (this did not surprise me), the bacon on the breakfast plate was so over cooked it was inedible, and the alfredo was huge with only 4 small chunks of chicken. When they brought back my eggplant with the correct pasta, it was cold, overly salty and undercooked. I NEVER not eat my food but had 3 bites and pushed it aside.  When I informed the waitress of my dissatisfaction, she sent the manager over to speak with us. I didn't go into details regarding all the issues, just the eggplant dish. The manager agreed that the eggplant dish was salty and that was because of the way it is prepared. Not a very satisfying answer but at that point I just wanted to leave. She removed the eggplant dish from the check and offered to get me something else but we were over it and ready to go.  Definitely won't be in a hurry to return to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=220

I've noticed at this location the rolls get smaller and smaller each time I go back, and it seems like the rice paper is hard. I wasn't thrilled with the Thai lettuce wraps either as the portions of the wrap ingredients seemed really stingy. I never minded it being expensive back east bc of the quality but this location really is falling short.

The food is right on par with the other CCF I've been to, but the servers in Reno could use a lesson in service. They tend to be slow and don't pay very good attention to their guests. However, the hostesses are warm and friendly. Some servers are better than others - one walking by and checked in to make sure we were doing okay. He also chatted with us for a minute, which made our experience nice. Try the beet salad with goat cheese! It's awesome!

Derek A.,"Sparks, NV",80,73,,4.0,11/24/2014,"I'd been to The Cheesecake Factory several times while visiting Seattle, so I was rather excited to check out the new place in Reno.  I allowed some time for the big rush to settle down before actually going there.  My wife and I chose to go this past Wednesday for lunch around 12:30, which happened to be one of the coldest days of the week at 47 degrees....brrr!   We got there and immediately I knew we'd have to make a decision...wait awhile or sit outside.  Keep in mind that my wife is always cold, even when it's 80 degrees out!  Table for two please...sure, about 15 minutes or immediate seating outside in their heated patio?  Hmm...typically a ""heated patio"" means you have to be right next to the heater or squeezed in between your new best friends to stay warm.  It's Reno so we gambled and chose the patio.  Well, let me be the first to correct myself regarding this particular patio; well positioned and effective heaters that allowed us both to take off our jackets and scoff at winter's breath.  I was quite impressed.   Our waitress was there shortly thereafter to get our drink order as we perused the largest menu known to man....or the restaurant industry.  Seriously, be prepared to take your time going through the page upon page of items to choose from.  How big is this kitchen???!!!  There are all types of food so I'm confident you'll find something you like!  Well, it was lunch so I chose the lunch version of the meatloaf...I mean after all I need to watch my figure and not be a glutton!  My wife decided to have the ""Skinnylicious Turkey Burger"" and salad.  Additionally we sprang for appetizers with the ""TexMex Eggrolls"".   We didn't have to wait long for our appetizers which we cleaned out fairly quickly, not because they were extraordinary but because we were famished.  The entrées came shortly thereafter and I was impressed.  I ensured that I ordered the ""lunch"" version of the meatloaf because it looked like a full blown meal.  I was told that it was...wow!  I'm a pretty good eater but this portion was quite large for being the ""smaller"" version of the entrée, not to mention a healthy scoop of mashed potatoes and vegetables.  For a chain restaurant the taste was very good, moist and flavorful.  The mashed potatoes were great as well and somehow kept finding their way to my wife's plate!  Her turkey burger was good and topped with sautéed onions...not exactly ""skinny"" but hey, she liked it and that's all the mattered.  Enjoying the hot meals on the heated patio with the cold weather rolling over the mountains was a really pleasant setting, despite being on the edge of Meadowood Mall.   Then it came time to decide upon dessert which is their namesake after all.  I had to opt for my tried and true favorite, the ""White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle"".  I was not disappointed.  Very creamy with the right amount of texture to what I personally feel a cheesecake should taste like.  No, I'm not an expert but it contains two of my favorite things...white chocolate and raspberry...how could I not choose this?!  My wife chose the ""Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake"".  I can't even pronounce that but she seemed to enjoy it later at home.  I guess she wanted to maintain the ""skinny"" part of her lunch! For an overall dining experience I have to say that I was mildly impressed.  The service and food were above average and I can't argue with the ability to dine outside and be as comfortable (if not more) than being inside.  This particular instance has to be a 4 star rating for me as I'm sure I'll return to see if they can maintain that.  In the meantime I need to hit the gym to work off the goodness!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=240
Lauren t.,"Sparks, NV",48,22,10,3.0,10/11/2014,"I have been to several other Cheesecake Factories before, so as a fan of the chain was very excited to see that Reno was finally getting one. My friend and I decided to go there tonight for an early dinner. I had heard horrible stories of the wait time and no call head seating. So as you can imagine I was nervous about a long wait. Much to my surprise we were seated in the bar area with in 5 minutes of checking. Our waitress was very nice and took our orders. My friend ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp added and a side house salad, and I ordered Evelyn's Favorite pasta and a side Cesar salad. The waitress asked if we would like our salads first and we both said yes. While we are waiting I have to say they did a really nice job with the decor. My only complaint with the atmosphere is the temperature We were freezing cold, and it wasn't just us the people of the other side of us were complaining about the temperature as well.Within 15 minutes of ordering, our food is brought out. Here is where I have an issue. My friend added shrimp to her pasta dish it was an extra $5 for 4 shrimp. I mean we could have just gone to Red Lobster around the corner and gotten a better deal. We also never received our salads. The restaurant was so busy and all the wait staff seemed super rushed. Not only that, but you could visibly see the waiters going to the managers and letting them know about a complaint, or a ticket that needed to be changed. Call me old fashioned, but I thought that is supposed to be done off the floor? There was no time to stop and enjoy the experience. It was May I take your order, here is your food, are you all done with this, and here's your check. Overall: Food - not as great as the other locations, just really bland  Staff- nice/friendly, but way too visibly frantic  Drinks- delish I recommend the mango crush  Price- it's a bit much for what your getting, and they aren't exactly Claim Jumper portions Will I return?

Twenty minutes pass...now I know it's not a fast food place and if I wanted something immediately I would have gone to the food court,  finally the food comes out. The flat bread was soggy, ,bland and  a poor choice on my part. The hamburger was well, a hamburger.

Brendan E.,"Monrovia, CA",22,77,7,2.0,11/16/2014,After reading a lot of reviews on here I was surprised at the bad reviews. Cheese cake factory is usually top notch. I frequent the cheese cake factory a lot. I live in California and always go to the arcadia and pasadena location. My normal menu choice is the spicy cashew chicken with white rice. It's normally moist and full of flavor. Sadly the meal I got tonight was not up to cheese cake standard. It was dry with little sauce and was an overall disappointment. Comparing this cheesecake factory to the ones I'm used to going to this one gets two stars.  I was asked if everything was okay and I'm not one to send my order back so i said yes.

Natalie-Felix U.,"Carson City, NV",0,11,,4.0,10/8/2014,"Okay, I know you're not supposed to review if you're connected to employees or you get freebies... But I get food home almost every day from the restaurant because my sister works there... And I still chose to go and eat there and pay for something I pretty much got for free every day. I think that means a lot.  I've eaten a lot of things from there. My sister Tina has worked there since before it opened and we even went to the staff appreciation breakfast and got to try a LOT of the menu. But this review is about the times I've been there and paid for food, so I'll stick to that.  Our waiter was J something. My sister and I went in late August after the premier of the new Doctor Who series and we got hungry after. Tina and I squeaked in just before closing. Everyone pretty much knew her, but since it wasn't her shift she didn't really know them. Our waiter was cool, he brought out Tina's and my drink without asking (And he got it right). I kinda like going places where they know your habits! So we ordered. I can't remember what Tina got... I think it was a French dip, but not sure. I'm pretty sure I ate it the next day because she won't eat leftovers. I remember it was good, really good, but I never pay attention to what she orders. I got the smokehouse burger, extra bbq for the fries. It was really super good, and I didn't finish it then, but I did about four o clock in the morning, right before I took her back so she could work.  We had the Oreo cheesecake. That... didn't really make it home. The slice of cheesecake is HUGE, and we had trouble finishing it size wise, but it was so good we were fighting over the last bite.  I like the environment. We were there at about ten at night and while the tables are close together, it was pretty quiet. I love the decor too.

Stacey K.,"Reno, NV",0,7,,4.0,8/23/2015,"The food was good, not worth price I don't think, but good nonetheless.

The kids meals were relatively okay priced but again not worth the cost with the exception of my son's Alfredo which was delicious. My wife and daughter enjoyed their macaroni and cheese burger but their only complaint would be the deep fried mac and cheese wasn't big enough. Cheesecake was amazing! Service was SLOW...and I mean SLOW. the entire process, even though we called ahead, took over 3 hours. This is waiting for tables, ordering food, waiting, eating, ordering again (dessert), eating, waiting for our check (this took forever) and paying. We didn't take forever to eat either but took FOREVER! Would we eat here again? Yes, if there was maybe 2 of us and we had nothing else to do with our day.

Everyone was really pleased with their choices, but I was super impressed with my Habachi Steak. The flavors were perfect, the meat was tender enough for my 7 month old daughter to eat some, the Wasabi mashed potatoes were just spicy enough. I have been thinking about it ever since. If I had the money to spare I'd probably have gone back a couple times since. The only reasons I didn't give them 5 stars is that for being named after it, their cheesecake isn't all that great, definitely tastes frozen and thawed.

Teresa F.,"Reno, NV",0,15,4,5.0,8/9/2014,"We've never been to a Cheesecake Factory, this was a first and it was excellent!  We had no idea they served so many food items.  We had the lunch portion of delicious fettuccine alfredo which was enough for 2 people and extra to take home.  They serve warm bread, which was great!  The atmosphere was very nice, we sat on the patio.  The only problem with the patio was the flies, not sure they can remedy this problem?  The staff was friendly and the cheesecake delicious! Our waiter, Fernando was very good and really friendly.  We will definitely be going back soon!  We will always request the patio in warm weather, flies or not....the decor is too cute right down to the chairs!  Felt like we were in California.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=260
Sarra K.,"Sparks, NV",152,115,123,4.0,9/17/2014,I was very happy to see that this restaurant came to reno! I have only been to the one in Sacramento and that place is huge!! The reno one is half the size. We ordered tuna tar tar and chicken simosas for an appetizer and that was delicious! I also got the berry mojito and that was very tasty. For my entree I got the oriental chicken salad. That was tasteless. Super bland. Bjs by far has a way better one!

Lauren C.,"Reno, NV",21,13,55,2.0,9/16/2014,"My second visit to the Cheesecake Factory was for dinner on a Thursday night. We waited 45 minutes for a table, which was expected. I was seated and waiting for friends when one of the hostesses was extremely rude the my gf trying to find the table we were already seated at!! She was 9 months pregnant and the hostess was absolutely horribly rude. Lots of attitude. We were seated by the kitchen right under the window that the kitchen connects to the dining area. I killed four flys and gnats at the table. There were flys EVERYWHERE! You could see them inside the glass to the kitchen as well. Needless to say we didn't have much of an appetite after that. I don't think I'll be returning to this location. Which is too bad, because they make a mean Reese's chocolate cake cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=260

I order a Cajun jambalaya pasta, I bite into my chicken and it's wet like, I'm a freak when it comes to undone chicken and when I told my mom in law who had the same dish she says that the chicken is just soft. Wtf! Soft and chicken are two words I don't want to put together. Sorry mom it's not cooked. As I pull all the chicken out and continue to eat the shrimp I am grossed out by a slimy, mushy underdone shrimp. Come on really why are you in business?

Jeffrey G.,"Reno, NV",12,10,1,3.0,9/8/2014,The Reno Cheesecake Factory is a standard restaurant of the franchise. This isn't necessarily a bad thing seeing as the franchise provides what they provide and they do it well. They took over the restaurant space where the former 775 Bistro was in the Meadowood Mall and expanded and renovated the space nicely. I went with a couple of friends and we all had a decent experience.

Chey E.,"Reno, NV",1,21,,1.0,8/30/2015,"We went here for our first time a couple weeks ago. We called in our order because our son fell asleep. They stated it would be 20-30 minutes. Right at 30 minutes we pulled up to the area where you can call for them to bring the food out to you. I called immediately. We waited another 15 minutes outside of the 30 minute time frame and our first call so I called again only to be put on a never ending hold. Could I have gone in? Yes! But the reason I ordered to go and used their call service was so I didn't have to wake my sleeping baby. Don't offer a service or time frame you can't keep. We finally got our food at just over 50 minutes from the initial call. My husband ordered the shepherds pie and it was so salty. He would have been better off just eating plain salt. This is coming from a man who salts and peppers everything! I ordered the tacos and they lacked flavor. They were also wet. It was hard to hold. It came with a side of rice which was so full of garlic that I just tossed it. I love garlic everything so for there too be too much garlic flavor, it must have been bad! My sons chicken strips were not any better than the rest of the experience or food so he just ended up eating a peanut butter and jelly from home. The only good part was the Cheesecake. My husband was upset about how awful the whole ordeal was so he called the next and spoke to a manager. Before we could even make the complaint we had to give her our card number to make sure we actually ate there...how ridiculous. She ended promising a gift certificate to him that still hasn't arrived two weeks later.

Nicole U.,"Reno, NV",0,20,2,3.0,9/12/2014,"Luckily I looked at the reviews before we left the house and I told the sitter this was going to be one of our longer dates due to the wait times people were reporting here. We visited on a Friday night and we were told the wait would be about 50 minutes. It is great that they take down your name and telephone number and will text you when the table is ready so you can walk around the mall. We ended up waiting 1 hour. I understand, the place is new to this area, in an extremely small location and it's had a lot of hype. Two tips for future Cheesecake Factory goers 1. They don't take reservations and don't have call-ahead seating 2. Don't wear heels! Between the long wait time and the incredibly slick floors, you'll be sorry! We are finally seated and wait 10 minutes for water, 20 minutes for my husband's mojito but I would say the wait for our food wasn't that long. My happiness about the food coming at a reasonable time was short lived because I found two 3 inch roots in my mashed potatoes! I am pregnant, was really looking forward to the mashed potatoes and was very turned off the minute I started digging through my food looking for worm looking roots. Yuck! We were also seated right by the front and people were looking at our dishes when they arrived and talking to us about the food and poking their heads over the half wall. I found that pretty rude and frustrating but there just isn't enough room in this place. We were there so long that we didn't have time to have dessert there so we decided to order to go. Another 20 minute wait for two slices of cheesecake and in that time, I saw two other tables send food back for reasons I couldn't hear. My husband had the BoomBoom shrimp and rice dish and it was amazing, I'll also say my original plain-jane cheesecake was amazing but it was such a long wait and time seated that I'll only be coming back to pick up desserts to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=300

I had the italian sandwich with fries with a mango cocktail. All of it was great, but the fries were not anything special. I also got a tiramisu cheesecake for dessert - yummy!

She got our drink orders promptly and was extremely patient as we picked appetizers. Once we were ready to order she took the order and kept getting bread for our group as we waited. She was attentive to our group making sure to refill our drinks. The appetizers and the few entrees ordered came out promptly, and everything tasted amazing. Rebecca talked with us while she was at our table making it a more personal experience. We ordered cheesecake as well of course and when they brought it out they placed candles in them, and decorated our store managers plate to celebrate for us.

Anyways we had a few drinks at the bar (great service, good drinks.). Finally seated. Our waitress, excuse my language was such a ditz. First, we were seated, no silverware, no napkins, no water. All standard btw. I've never worked in a restaurant but I've eaten out enough to know this. Anyways, we kept having to ask, can I get more butter, another glass of water, maybe more water, another napkin (since I asked for one and she didn't bring one for my guest).

The restaurant is small in size but has a full bar. Seating in the booths gives you the impression of privacy. The noise of the music and the other patrons was loud. Had to talk over the noise and really had to listen to the wait staff when ordering. The food and cheesecake was very good and worth the wait. Will be making this restaurant the special occasion restaurant. Restrooms were clean and well maintained. The busboys for some reason were being kept busy cleaning the floor next to our table. Did not see anyone spill anything on the floor. The uniforms on the wait staff were very professional looking. Parking at the MeadowWood Mall is a bear at anytime near the restaurant location.

Flower M.,"Reno, NV",68,67,76,3.0,3/18/2015,I went for lunch with two friends of mine. We asked to sit at a table so we could all see each other while we visited. They were accommodating. I had the lunch herb crusted salmon thinking it might be a sensible option for someone who is desperately on a mission to watch their caloric intake. I opted for the asparagus as my side. Which both tasted fantastic but when I got home I researched the calorie count of my food because I also go the low carb cheesecake. The whole meal weighed in at over 1200 calories. I'm a little sad that I thought I was choosing all the healthier options. I learned my lesson. Stay far away from the Cheesecake Factory or try on option on their low calorie menu. None of those items seemed appetizing when I was there today. And for the love of God try to find a cheesecake slice that doesn't have more than 400 calories a slice. Lol the low carb cheesecake has about 570 Low carb does not equal low fat when it comes to cheesecake:(. The salmon came in at 757 calories which was surprising to me.

And let's not get started with the choices of cheesecake (which is my absolutely favorite and my weekends) after much consideration I went with the white chocolate raspberry truffle slice oh boy I was in heaven. The prices aren't too bad for the size and yummy was if the food! I also learned that YES you can indeed order a 17"" cheesecake for about $24 and a big while cheesecake for about $40. Our waitress was phenomenal and answered any questions with much ease. Also we got to sit outside on the patio which was perfect since the weather was good and personally I'd rather be outside on warm weather days. The wait time was pretty intense 60-85min but when you have a mall to browse to help waste the time it goes by quickly and they text you when your numbers ready which is awesome so you don't have to wait!!!!

The restaurant was fairly empty so we were seated quickly. However, the waitress tried giving us a table that was right next to an occupied table that had very loud guests. I told her I wanted a different table, and after rolling her eyes, she sat us in a different area.  The food was disappointing. I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken since it is one of my favorite dishes. As soon as they set the plate down in front of me I could tell it was different from the other four cheese pastas I have had. First, the FOUR CHEESE pasta had no cheese, and I had to scavenge the plate for the chicken. Second, the waitress knocked over my fork and some pasta onto my dress as she was serving parmesan cheese. I was barely offered an apology. The waitress was very inattentive and had a bad mood when she would come by to the table.

Je'an H.,"DOYLE, CA",0,28,4,5.0,11/1/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory at Meadowood Mall in Reno is the ""New Restaurant In Town. The Cheesecake Factory is a corporate restaurant. As restaurants go, they all have good days and bad days. New restaurants make more mistakes as they have to find that balance that they are trying to attain on a regular basis. New restaurants ""of course"" have the most problems when they are crowded. What sets restaurants apart is the fact that some try harder than others to give you that ""Foodie"" experience rather than just making they're mark as a place to eat. The Cheesecake Factory at Meadowood Mall is one of those restaurants that seem to try harder to give you that all around 'Foodie"" experience rather than just slinging out the chow. The restaurant itself has a nice look and a nice feeling atmosphere with conscientious  employees. You can be seated inside or in the outside courtyard. They also have a bar area where you can also eat. When crowded it can be a bit noisy but it is not uncomfortable or loud. The menu is extensive and is set by the corporate office. I must say somebody at that office knows what they are doing. As extensive as the menu is, one would be hard pressed to find an item lacking in style, flavor, and quality. Me and my wife were lucky to experience the Cheesecake Factory when they were spot on with food and service. This is what good restaurants strive to attain. This is an upscale casual restaurant. The price of the food is at the medium range. Average price for appetizers is $6.00 To $13.00 dollars etc..  Average price for entree's is around the $15.00 to $20.00 dollar range with Fillet Mignon topping out in the $30.00 range. They have two great extensive menu's. A Skinnylicious menu and the Regular menu. The skinnylicious menu is more healthy fair were the regular menu has the main dishes like steak, fish, shepherds pie, meatloaf, and pasta etc.. Both menu's are awesome and original in variety. I have to say the sauces that are served with quite a few of the menu items are very, very good. The food in general is fresh and over the top in quality. You pay for what you get. We ate there on a Friday around 3:00 p.m. We started our dining experience with two appetizers (which we shared) that were very tasty and fun....Yes I said fun.  The Ahi Tartare, and the Thai Lettuce Wraps were fresh, tasty and fun to eat. The sauces that accompanied the dishes were over the top. My wife ordered the Kobe Burger which was perfectly cooked ""Rare"". Not medium rare or medium. it was cooked Rare. And that burger melted in your mouth. ""Over The Top"". My wife chose the soup of the day as a side. It was clam chowder and it was very tasty but cannot compete with the Peppermills Oceano restaurant clam chowder. Again tasty but not enough clam taste for our liking. I ordered their famous meat loaf. I am a picky meatloaf lover. The meatloaf melted in my mouth, the side dish succotash was spot on and the mashed potatoes had a very rich taste to them that lingered on your taste buds for a while. ""Over The Top"". The seasonal pumpkin cheesecake was perfect....That is to be expected after all, it is The Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress was Kimberly who was very helpful and added to our dining experience by waiting on us as if she really cared that we had a good time and a good meal. ""Over The Top"". Other staff that would walk by our table seemed to take notice if a plate was empty and needed to be removed, or if our water in our glass was low etc. Very balanced. The manager ( Lezlie Siegel) of this restaurant seems to know what she is doing and has a vision for what she wants this restaurant to be like, and she seems to be that type of person that will get what she wants to accomplish. Good going .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-reno-6?start=280
