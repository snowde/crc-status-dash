Amber L.,"Lincoln, CA",13,72,12,3.0,12/10/2012,"holiday dinner party! so sad that they don't take reservations for large parties for local businesses on the weekend!! But I was able to call ahead of time and tell them my name, the time we were coming and how many were in our party. We were planning on arriving at 6:15. I got there at 5:20 to make sure we had our table at that time. Everyone else arrived on time, when I told them we would be there... And we ended up waiting to be seated until 7. By then we were super hungry so it is nice that they serve bread. We had bread for about an hour until our food finally came (I think they refilled it about 3 times) and by then we were full off of bread. A couple of people ordered burgers and wanted them well done with no pink at all. They came out rare, and were sent back and prepared again and brought out when everyone else was done eating. I've had better experiences here.. I know they can do better. Guess they just can't handle larger parties.. So wouldn't recommend for special occasions. Especially when your tab ends up being $300+.. Go spend it somewhere that can handle it and treat you well...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=520

Mrs. B.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,419,37,3.0,11/22/2010,"This is what happens when a restaurant tries to do too much. No need to have asian food and mac & cheese in the same restaurant. The cheesecake is tasty but with 80g of fat in each piece (yes, that's more fat grams than most hamburgers) I recommend sharing a piece with a friend (or three). You could easily consume in excess of 4,000 kcal here in one meal & for that reason I choose not to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=520

Jen H.,"Roseville, CA",236,222,51,3.0,7/31/2010,"I am not sure how I feel about this place.  The cheesecake is great - that should be a no-brainer.  However, on my last trip I ordered the Avocado egg rolls and was really disappointed.  They were too tangy.  CPK has them beat for that recipe.  Our waiter was great at the beginning, but as the meal progressed he was harder to track down.  I just wanted boxes and my bill, but he had other things to do I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=520
Randall S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",127,138,,5.0,8/10/2010,"When I go here I always get the avocado egg rolls, and the teriyaki chicken which is awesome. The thing about this place though is it does have such a wide variety of food, and when your in the mood for something in particular, they usually have it (unless it is pretty unusual).

Audrey G.,"San Francisco, CA",5,4,,5.0,2/14/2013,"My boyfriend and I went to this chain tonight and were pleasantly surprised with the customer service. We both ordered burgers and I ordered mine medium well as usual. Unfortunately, my burger was a little too pink for my liking. I let our waitress, Anna, know and she immediately took it to the back to get it replaced. Her manager, Chris, then came over and made it clear to apologize for the uncooked meat and to let me know that if there were any more problems, he would love to pay for our dessert. A few moments later, another manager, Slade, came over and also apologized saying that he wanted to make sure we were not upset. I got the burger back within minutes and it was PERFECT. Slade and Anna both came back to check on me and make sure I was satisfied. When we were ready to order our desserts, Anna let us know that they were completely covered and we couldn't have been more surprised! That is not what we were expecting at all and it made us very pleased and eager to return. I totally recommend this restaurant. Not only is the food and cheesecake phenomenal, the customer service is amazing. They definitely have a great team.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=520

Marissa C.,"Sacramento, CA",15,55,3,4.0,5/18/2008,"After a long day of shopping, we decided to try the Galleria's Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch.  We walked in around 1pm and it was packed!  I asked how long of a wait for a table of 4 and the hostess said around 15-30minutes.  After a 15 minute wait, our buzzer went off.   We were seated in the bar area which I was interesting since we had our 3 year old son with us.  It was fine since we were at the edge of the bar and he was more interested yelling out the colors of each drink he saw.  Our waitress was wonderful!  She never let our drinks go empty and always kept the table uncluttered.  We had our Calamari appetizer, it was tender and lightly breaded.  The garlic dip was bland and tasted more like mayo. We waited a LONG time for our food.  As we looked around, everyone had the same face ""Where is our food?""  At 2:15, our food finally came out, the Herb Crusted Salmon, Crusted Chicken Romano, Lettuce Wraps and Grilled Cheese all looked and tasted wonderful.  Our son did not touch his grilled cheese because he wanted to go outside.  The long wait for food did not do well for him.... The manager came around right after we got our food; which was interesting because where was she when we were waiting.  Besides the wait, our lunch was great and will go there again.   PROS:  Great wait staff, attentive assistant waiters, and great food. CONS:  No kid's menu, and the long wait for food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=520

Candace Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",83,395,486,4.0,12/22/2017,"While doing some Christmas shopping, we decided to grab a few appetizers as a light lunch /snack to refuel.  As you might expect, the shopping hordes were out in numbers, and there was a bit of a line. As we waited to be seated, I noticed a separate table set up to sell gift cards across from the cheesecake to go counter.   It looked like they were accommodating the extra traffic for to-go dessert products well. Once led to our table, I noticed the decor and the various glass light fixtures illuminating the space.  There were several sconce-style lamps that resembled the Eye of Sauron and a few that looked steam-punky with reddish-brown glass cones with black iron supports. (It's a pretty cool effect.).  We quickly picked three appetizers:  the Cubano, the samosa, and the mushroom plate.   While we waited for them to be prepared, we were pleased with the bread and plate of butter that was served to us.  The brown wheat bread was very good, and the sourdough was not bad.  The butter was soft enough to spread easily, I observed. The food came, and we dug in.  The small plates were pleasingly presented.   I was hungry enough to have to consciously slow myself down to taste and enjoy.   All three dishes were pretty good, albeit the Cubano was a tad on the oily side.  The mushrooms were savory with the seasonings.  The samosas came with a white sauce that went well with each crisp bite.   The service was good.  It was quick and courteous service.  I get the sense that this establishment has a good training program.  We'd been seated by one person, who subsequently introduced us to our server.   After the bread and the order-taking, there was a shift change, and we were introduced to the subsequent server.   We did not experience any lapse in service, which was a pleasant surprise.   I do believe that this enhanced our experience.  I will confess that I do not normally frequent large chain restaurants, but this dining experience was unexpectedly quite pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville
Doug G.,"Lincoln, CA",242,268,356,3.0,12/12/2017,"I had been doing some last minute holiday shopping at the Roseville Mall and decided to stop at the Cheesecake Factory for a light lunch. I had never been to this particular location. It was peak lunch time and the place was busy .... I mean really busy There was a line of folks waiting to be assigned and then ... subsequently shown to their tables. I opted for the bar and grabbed the first available bar stool. Looking around I could see that this was a typical Cheesecake Factory restaurant. Modern, classy look and feel and very good service. Why mess with a solid business model. I started with a Conn Creek Cabernet Sauvignon and ... a club soda to stay hydrated. Then, I ordered a cup of soup and a small green salad. The soup was a chili, lime, chicken tortilla and it was delicious. Chicken cubes in a rich broth, fresh lime juice, green onion, cilantro, cumin, red peppers and corn tortilla strips (and much more I can't identify). Generous serving. The green salad included lettuce and spinach. The tomatoes were a little too firm - not yet rip. The balsamic dressing was pretty good. All in all, a positive experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville
Kelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,642,695,4.0,12/7/2017,"I've been in here a few times and it's a great location. Most of these restaurants are the same and this one is no exception, which isn't a bad thing. My friend and I have the same thing every time we come here. We start with the edamame and then we split the spicy cashew chicken. But the highlight of the meal is actually the cucumber lemonade. It's so refreshing. Everyone must try it at least once. Their bread is always fresh and warm. You have to be careful not to fill up on that first or you won't be able to finish your meal.  Their portions are huge so if you don't want leftovers, just split a meal with someone. Their service has always been great. If you're looking for a good meal this Cheesecake Factory won't disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville

Sherri G.,"Rocky River, OH",61,132,137,5.0,10/15/2017,"I so appreciate this cheesecake factory location. The food is always fresh and the menu options so extensive that I can't fathom anyone not finding something they enjoy or are in the mood for on this menu. My difficulty is often deciding what to order. What I love most about this location is there ease of carry out. I travel to this area once a month and always find myself having at least one night where I just need to grab and go but do want typical fast food. Cheesecake factory makes take out a breeze. You can call ahead and have the option of coming in to pick up or you can drive up to one of their pick up parking spaces in the mall parking lot. they have four or five parking spaces allocated to drive up pick-up. All you have to do is call the phone number on the sign when you arrive and one of their cheerful staff will deliver the food right to your car.  Yesterday after a full day of weather related Airport flight delays I arrived into my hotel area after 11:30pm.  I was worried that my only option would be some 24 hour fast food chain. To my delight Cheesecake Factory was open until 12:30 AM. I ordered the Renee's  special which came with your choice of a chicken salad or club sandwich and soup or salad.  I chose the chicken salad sandwich which was served on a brioche toast and there soup which was a hearty baked potato, delicious. It really put a positive note on a difficult day. I would highly recommend if you are going to do carry out that you spend some time preparing by looking over their menu online, especially if you are adding in cheesecake which is always the end to a great meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville

I asked to try the tropical iced tea at her suggestion, but I didn't care for it either. I didn't ask for it to be taken off my bill, nor did I expect it to be; but she didn't charge me for it, which I really appreciated. Great customer service!

Donovan H.,"Citrus Heights, CA",298,320,1322,4.0,1/16/2017,"For those of you that have not dined at ""The Cheesecake Factory"", I must warn you that their menu book is about the size of a bible. And trying to find the perfect appetizer, entree, drink, and dessert can be way more of a tedious process than you might expect. To put it simple, they more or less have everything you're looking for; salads, sandwiches, burgers, seafood, chicken, steak, pizza, pasta, soup, breakfast food (during AM hours), well you get the picture. The location that I am focusing on is in Roseville and is more or less part of the Galleria shopping mall. Do keep in mind that parking here can be extremely difficult since the parking lot is shared with the mall shoppers. And it can get even more crowded if you plan on dining during dinner hours, weekends, and over the holiday shopping season. My lovely lady and I were very fortunate to grab a parking spot that was very close to the front entrance. And this just happened to have been on a Sunday afternoon around 5:00pm. The inside can describe several words; elaborate, gaudy, extravagant, and posh. It almost reminds me of being at a casino with the high ceilings, gold trim, and Tuscan artwork throughout. This particular location has a generous bar area, large tables for 10+ guests, and booths for smaller parties and couples. When my lady and I came, we put our names on a waiting list, told it would only take 15-20 minutes and received a buzzer. And they were good on their word as the buzzer did indeed go off in about 15 minutes. What makes the waiting part difficult is that there is no real sitting area except for a few small benches. Once we were seated, we were given menus and only a few minutes later, iced water with lemon wedges. Luckily we both knew what we wanted which helped simplify the whole process. I went with their ""Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon"" complete with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. She ordered their ""Steak Diane"" which also includes mashed potatoes as well as sauteed mushrooms and grilled onions. As for drinks, I went with a 22 oz. of their Racer 5 IPA while she had their Red Sangria. Our server was very friendly, had a good sense of humor, and made us feel right at home from the time we were seated until the time we left. And as busy as this place was, our food came out within only 15 minutes. Keep in mind, there must've been at least 200 guests dining here when we ate here so I am guessing they have a huge kitchen with at least 3 dozen chefs/cooks. As for our food, everything tasted good as what we had expected. My salmon had a nice seasoned flavor while the lemon sauce was a great addition. Her steak was seasoned very well as each medallion was tender yet there was quite an abundance of mushrooms on her plate.  Since we were both very full (this place is notorious for serving their guests hearty portions), we decided on ordering a slice of their cheesecake to-go. We both agreed on their ""Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake"". This included glazed strawberries with a few whipped cream puffs in our to-go box. When eating it at home, I do have to say that their cheesecake is one of the best I've tried and it's what they're known for, not to mention worth the extra calories. Overall, ""The Cheesecake Factory"" is and always will be a restaurant that has a little something for everyone. I do advice researching what you'd like to eat prior to coming in here to simplify the entire process. In the past, I have had many different food items and the quality of their food competes with restaurants such as ""BJ's Brewery"", ""Yard House"", and ""Outback Steakhouse"". Prices are competitive and if you're looking to save a few bucks, they do offer an excellent Happy Hour menu. Not to mention, a Sunday brunch for the weekend warriors. My rating for the Roseville ""Cheesecake Factory"", a respectable 4-stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville

Jessica H.,"Davis, CA",11,26,12,3.0,9/23/2017,"There's a reason they don't call this the Pasta Factory. We ordered a Chicken Bellagio and Louisiana Chicken Pasta, both popular enough dishes to warrant copycat recipes on the internet.  The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is bow tie pasta (haven't had that since elementary school!) dotted with little slices of mushroom and red bell peppers topped with parmesan breaded chicken breast. The pasta itself was bland and the sauce lacked Cajun flair. The breaded chicken was delicious: tender and flavorful and dusted with cayenne pepper for an added kick. It saved what would otherwise have been a really lackluster dish. The Chicken Bellagio is basil pasta and cream sauce topped with breaded chicken (yay!) and arugula. Arugula itself is slightly bitter, and the dressing was just plain sour. Interesting combination. I felt like I was being punished with a healthy serving of greens before I was allowed to dig into the rest of the dish. Once again, the highlight of the dish was in it's breaded chicken: tender, delicious (but no cayenne pepper here). The pasta itself tastes like a bland rendition of pesto pasta. What does it matter if the basil is in the pasta or in the sauce? We topped off the evening with some Coffee and Creme Chocolate Supreme cheesecake. You know it was good because it rhymed and because well this is the Cheesecake Factory.  Overall, the experience was as expected and consistent with other Cheesecake Factory restaurants I'd been to in the past.  Special shoutout to our server, Jenna, for being super sweet and recommending the awesome dessert. If this review were for your service, alone, I'd be rating a hell of a lot more than 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=20
Joanne C.,"Sacramento, CA",58,28,10,2.0,9/19/2017,"Arrived last night around 7pm. There was a few people in the lobby waiting to be seated. We waited for a table for 6 people. We got seated fairly quickly. Our waiter took our drink order, delivered our drinks then gave us their delicious bread and butter! Shortly after we ordered our dinner. We ordered Tex mex egg rolls for an app. Our waiter came by shortly and said they were out of the egg rolls and if we wanted something else. So we decided on the taquitos. Shortly after that the manager comes by and she apologizes and says they are out of the mix and asked if we wanted something else. We went with the hot wings and she comped us for that. Which we appreciate!  Here's what bugged the crap out of me. The table to the left of us ordered 5 mins before we did. The table to the right of us had a different waiter who took their order 10 mins after we got seated.  Long story short both tables were served their dinner and ate, devoured their dinners while we were still waiting for ours. The table to the left actually ordered cheesecake and we still haven't been served our food!  Both parties were done eating while we sat there looking at each other!  Get it together cheesecake.

Alena M.,"Citrus Heights, CA",33,64,216,2.0,5/11/2017,"Mediocrity at its best! That about sums it up for my experience at the Cheesecake Factory this last Monday night.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants to begin with and definitely not the restaurants that do it all. Mexican, Italian, Asian and so much more all packed into an enormous menu. You know that saying? Jack of all traits is a master of none, well this definitely confirmed that theory.. Came here for my husbands company dinner and left pretty disappointed. The biggest disappointment was the service, followed by the less than average meals provided.  Our waitress ( forgot her name) was just blah... not friendly or personable. No general knowledge of the menu or drinks and carried a smart ass kinda attitude.  My hubby wanted a Bloody Mary and asked how they were here ( not all Bloody Marys are created equal) , her answer "" ah I don't know, aren't they all the same? Never had one come back!"" Really?  That's the best you can do? What a turn off! Same snotty , unbecoming attitude continued throughout the evening and especially when it came time to splitting the bill. It took every good part of me to keep me from ripping her a new one. God knows, I'm trying to be a better person. We saw our waitress a total of 3 times through our entire night, once to take orders, one drink refill and to pay the bill. That's it's! Forget the "" do you need anything?"" The "" how's your food?"" Or "" would you like another martini?"" No where to be found.  Forgive the rant but when have people given up on service and stopped taking pride in their work? Since when doing just the bare minimum become sufficient?  Food was just ok, not good, not bad. Pretty to the eye but lacking in flavor. Over cooked pork chop and bland fish tacos bout sums it up. Edible but certainly not enjoyable. I had to pour hot sauce on my tacos for flavor for Christ's sake ! In all honesty I really wanted to give this place a 1 star review but the delicious dirty vodka martinis could not be ignored. By the way Cheesecake Factory, your Bloody Mary sucks!

At this point I was regretting not choosing a different place, and was thinking of leaving! Anyways he approached us and we ordered, and waited another 30 minutes to get our food, the food was okay, I'll give them an extra star for that but in general their customer service needs major changes! Also I was disturbed with the dinnerware and how it wasn't even clean and super old, you could see spots and, just didn't even look like they're well cleaned!

I ordered the carne asada steak medallion and they over salted it and the rice was so dry I barely touched it. Also we ordered the chicken samosas for an app and they were over cooked.  Hubby had steak and he said it was tough meat. The price they charge you think they would improve the quality of their food.

My husband and I had a gift card and decided to order out since it was a Friday and packed. I got there and I had to wait in line 30 minutes because you pick you food up at the same counter where they have customers indecisively picking out cheesecake. Especially as a pregnant woman, this was no fun. The wait also meant that our food was even more cold and stale by the time we got to actually eat it. My husband turkey burger had a massive amount of grilled onions on it, my roast dip was way too salty, and put fries were hard. Everything had that greased glazed on it and we spent $31 on the 2 meals.

Ursula O.,"Lincoln, CA",1045,288,720,2.0,3/14/2016,"The night started out great... We arrived about 10:30 with a 15 to 20 minute wait-which was accurate. It was a good crowd for Friday night.  There isn't much of a waiting area. Maybe 2 benches that sit comfortably for 2. We awkwardly stood in front of the to go area. There was a case of stuffed animals with the names of some of their cheesecake on them... they were cute. It was elegant and the designs on the wall were intriguing. It was like walking into an art gallery with designs everywhere... When our buzzer lit up, they sat us toward the right side of the restaurant. It was a very cozy table. After a few minutes, we ordered an appetizer-the zucchini sticks and a bacon burger to split. It came with 2 kinds of bacon-thick candied bacon and crispy bacon. Sounded great! We asked that they not put on the ""secret sauce."" Our waitress was very attentive, very nice.  She brought us bread and butter and a few minutes later, we got our zucchini sticks. The zucchini sticks were great, but the ranch tasted sour. So next time, I'm bringing my own ranch, lol! We finish all of our zucchini sticks by the time the burger made it out. We had received an extra plate so that we can split it ourselves. As we checked out the amazing looking burger....AND found that damn secret sauce on it! So we told the waitress, and a manager made her way out to let us know they were working on another one. We sat about 10 minutes waiting for our remake. When it came out, a manager delivered it. :-) We check for the no sauce on the burger, cut the thing in half. ... 2 bites in, I thought I had hair in my mouth....but couldn't really find it unless I wanted to split my food out and inspect it. Plus, I only thought. When I looked back at my plate, sure enough, there was a dark hair on my plate. Trying to convince myself it was mine, I tried to pick it...but it had been intertwined in my burger. It was thin, about 4 or 5 inches long and absolutely not mine. My husband watched as I wrapped it around my hand to pull it out of my burger.  Disgusting!  We stopped eating, they apologized and asked if we wanted anything else.  Not really. I THINK I HAD PART OF THAT HAIR IN MY MOUTH! They did offer us a slice of cheesecake, which we took home. It was the salted caramel.  We paid for our zucchini sticks and Steve's soda, which came out to $9.  Normally, this obviously would've been a 1 star review...but our waitress was so attentive and nice.

FoodLover C.,"Carmichael, CA",0,14,18,3.0,12/14/2016,This review is based on our food that we ordered. I had the hibachi steak and my girlfriend had the da vinci pasta. We also ordered the deep fried zucchini and avocado. Too much salt in our zucchini. We tried the fried mac n cheese and it was good. My steak was done medium rare. I didnt eat my mashed potato because i dont like mashed potato and I forgot to switch it with other sides. Deep fried asparagus is good. The hibachi steak is like steak topped with terriyaki sauce imo which is not a good combination. The outcome of my steak was a little bit sweet. I was expecting to taste at least a little of the wasabi.  The da vinci penne pasta of my girlfriend is somewhat okay but I'd recommend you to get a different pasta. It is lacking of taste and a kick. There was chicken and mushrooms but i feel like it is lacking of taste. I feel like I'd like to boil my pasta with salt and after sautéing my chicken and mushroom I'd simmer it with chicken broth and mix the penne pasta in it. Service is okay.

Our waiter hardly came by even tho she had to know we were gunna be spending a bit of a chunk of change for a 2 people party 3. Our mixed alcohol drinks (Hennessy and Coke and mojito), numerous of them tasted very watered down and like the alcohol was non existent! This trip was a waste of $95!

Regina A.,"Folsom, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/2/2017,A friend of my loves the Cheesecake Factory. So I went there today at 4pm to purchase a gift card . I approached the podium and asked if I could purchase a gift card. The hostess at the counter who I later found out was the manager ( Jennifer March) never looked in my direction or ever greeted me in any fashion. But said we will be with you. I approached a second hostess station and was told by other employees that I needed to go back to the first station to purchase a gift card. I told the employees at the counter that I felt Jenifer was rude and showed a bad example of customer service. I requested her business card. At first they didn't want to give my her business card but after I insisted on getting their names they gave me what I asked for. Overall worst example ever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=100

We were never talked to or apologized for how long it was taking. Then all 3 of our families had messed up orders. Wrongs Salads, food given to other people, kids meals without fruit,  burgers with no cheese and 2 bottom buns. I'm sorry but when your paying $15 for a burger this is unacceptable.  To top things off a plate was dropped on my 11 year old nieces back and broke. Finally the manager apologized. To little to late.   Offering for 3 families of 12 people to share a slice of cheesecake when you had to come 4 times and we waited over half hour.  Needless to say I will think twice about spending $15 per person for this kind of service. I could not believe when we received our bills and NOTHING was taken off.

Joseph K.,"Rocklin, CA",6,27,4,1.0,8/9/2017,"This is by far the most disappointing experience i've ever had at the Cheesecake Factory. I told the waitress I had celiac and that I needed the steak to be gluten free. She responded back with A lot of attitude. When I asked her if the meat would have a nice char on the outside if I ordered it medium and she responded ""no"". So I then ordered it medium well. There was absolutely no pink in it. It was like they left the steak out to die. Dried out and burnt to a crisp..disgusting. On top of the service and food being terrible. My stomach was in absolute pain after the meal. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone, especially people with celiac or food allergies. I can't think of one good thing that came out of this experience. In the past I've always had a great experience with the servers but this was comparable to visiting a restaurant in hell. Maybe they were really desperate in the hiring process.

Josh N.,"Folsom, CA",612,1292,568,3.0,3/29/2016,"Sweet old Uncle Milton gave us a gift card to this joint so off to the Cheesecake Factory we went. I have visited their location in Arden Arcade a handful of times for work meetings and I have always had a decent experience. TCF is a odd duck to me, the restaurants are quite beautifully adorned but the patrons are generally casually dressed. The food is typical chain restaurant ""menu for every taste"" yet is expensive for what you get. The menu touts fresh proteins and local sourced produce when available, which is not common to chain restaurants. Fresh food is commendable but when your menu is exactly 714 pages long execution can become a problem. I ordered the ""Roadside Sliders"". Noted hamburger aficionado George Motz wrote an article recently touting the Roadside Sliders as one of the better examples you can get. I don't disagree with his assessment as all the ingredients are there: white squishy bun, fresh beef, onion and pickle (and for some reason ketchup, I held the ketchup). The problem lies with the aforementioned 714 page menu. How can you cook everything properly when you have so much to do? The answer in my entree was you can't. The beef was overcooked, the onions were beyond charred and I had to steal some of the daughter's ketchup (shame!!!) to tackle the dryness. That being said the server was given back a clean plate. I couldn't leave without a slice of cheesecake. I ordered the ""Original"". Tremendously delicious!! Graham Cracker Crust, creamy sour cream filling and whip cream to round it out. It is tough to beat. In closing, disappointing entree and phenomenal dessert. That is one fat man's opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=100

Kim H.,"Rocklin, CA",61,106,34,2.0,3/9/2017,"I can honestly say (honest, imagine that!) that my review is based on their service, not so much the food itself. We have had three visits in the past year, with exception to ""date night"" where it was just my Husband and myself, the other two times we had a part of 8, and a party of 11.  On both the occasions where we were with large parties, our WAIT time was over 2 hours.  That being said, it is understandable that there would be a wait.  The first time, it was a FAMILY gathering, we were told multiple different times that our table would be ""coming soon.""  After the 5th time you've heard that, you start getting irked.  On the second occasion, it was the evening of Sierra College graduation, and it rained that night prompting the ceremony to be cleared due to rain/lightening.  When we arrived, we were told an hour wait, by the time we were seated, it was 2 hours and 26 minutes later.  The ""thing"" that really bothers me is the REPEATED TIMES we were given, ""Your table should be ready soon.""  No, it wasn't.  Now, my vision of customer service (especially on visit # 3 where the MANAGER became involved) there was NO offer of free appetizer, dessert......nothing.  THAT is not good customer service. The food was VERY slow coming out, and 3 orders were wrong.  The server was EXCELLENT, so we brushed it off and adhered to our 18% tip policy.  Now, ONE of those entrees should have been given FREE of charge, but again, NOTHING. We won't go with large groups ever again, perhaps just our date nights.  Hoping that any Manager seeing this review considers the ""wording"" to large parties as far as when their table might be ready.   The food is typically pretty good, even if I don't eat cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=60

Mike D.,"Sacramento, CA",70,7,1,1.0,9/22/2017,I'm very disappointed this evening.. normally our favorite place to eat for a celebration or date night. Tonight was my birthday and my fiancé wanted to take me out. I always get the same thing.. Parmesan crusted chicken. Tonight was horrible it was the worst preparation I have ever had.. it was beyond soggy to the point that it was mush on a piece of chicken. The waiter was at no fault and we were very polite about it. I told him I didn't wanna send it back because I know what happens when you complain about food.. however he ensured me it was no issue. I agreed he could have them remake it. Shortly after I believe it was a supervisor that came up and apologized about the inconvenience and assured me it would come out perfect! I said thank you and about 10 min later a fresh order came out. Before the waiter left he said how is this.. I took my fork and scraped off a puddle of breading.. it was way worse than the first time! At that point I lost my appetite. My fiancé had stopped eating waiting for me to get the remake.. so now her food had been sitting for 20 min. The waiter took my food back and the supervisor came back and said we took it off your bill and had it grilled up more.. we ended up leaving the remade food because it was still mush and wasn't happy at all.. so we received the bill and paid it.. still tipped 15% because it wasn't the waiters fault.. still ended up paying almost 60 bucks..  2 sodas  1 potsticker order 2 pieces of cheese cake Her lettuce wraps.

Robbie R.,"Rocklin, CA",15,322,991,2.0,3/11/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located right at the Roseville Galleria Shopping Center along with other upscale chain restaurants. I only came here cause a friend dragged me in here, she really like the place. For me, it seemed just too busy, not too many people wise, but the atmosphere I found far from relaxing. The service was fast and efficient and all bubbly in a rehearsed chain restaurant kind of way. The menu is huge to so many choices it's too had to decide. We started with the fried calamari for $13. It was a pretty standard prep and similar to what most sports bar make, but $13 , I thought was a bit high. For my lunch, I had Fish and Chips $18 and my friend had the Chinese Chicken Salad for $15. The food was tasty enough, nothing to make me gush, but the prices for what you get sort of left a sour taste in my mouth, like I sort of felt ripped off by our $60 lunch with tax and tip and all I got was Fish and chips and a shared appetizer of calamari.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=60

One order had more than seven different mistakes on it including salad sizes wrong, incorrect burger, dish with pasta instead of rice, fries not delivered at all, and more. W called and the manager started interrupting after each complaint we told, trying to explain something or other, until she realized how bad their mistakes had been. This was during the NBA finals dip their entire staff must have not been paying attention. Really bad bad experience. Tried again last night. Found a nice sized bug in the salad.

However, last night I was feeling brave and ordered something different....the mac & cheese burger.  Oh em gee!! It was so amazing & perfect & cheesy & delicious! Basically, it's a chargrilled burger on a grilled roll topped with a deep fried patty of fried mac & cheese and then sliced cheese on top of that.  It is served with shredded lettuce, tomato, pickle, & onion on the side. This burger has got to be the best burger I have ever eaten. I always make sure to order a slice of cheesecake to eat when I get home. CF is one of those places that will satisfy just about anyone's craving. Don't forget to eat the brown bread!! It's to die for! The only negatives are: Limited seating in the lobby area The restaurant is LOUD The restaurant is pretty dark.  The lobby gets to be really crowded & it makes it difficult for the servers to pick up Cheesecake from the cheesecake counter.  Other than that, CF is great!

I came in for Lunch, and usually I prefer lunch service than dinner service.  It's always busy, crowded no matter what day or time you come here ...  and on their Menu you can order anything at anytime!  I love the Ahi Tartare appetizer, it's very tasty, pretty presentation, and nice flavors of the soy sauce with Avocado, ginger, Ahi tuna.  I tend to always order the same thing to eat, either the Steak Diane or Chicken Madeira.  Those are definitely my top 3 favorite choices.  Haven't tried many other items on their menu yet, but I did have Brunch at Sacramento Arden, which they do have an awesome Sunday Brunch menu. As for cheesecakes, I usually try to order a different one each time I go there and haven't been disappointed yet.  I tried the Pumpkin one last year, so I know that is great!  Salted Caramel was OK.  So far my most favorites are the Tuxedo and Red Velvet, but want to try so many more!!!!  Yesterday was actually the first time I ever ordered Cheesecake a la mode.  I guess I was expecting only one scoop of ice cream, but it came with two scoops of Vanilla ice cream.  Definitely could not finish it :(  I really enjoyed the Red Velvet cheesecake with the ice cream, it was perfectly delicious together.  You can also purchase whole cheesecakes, they are kind of expensive.  I am thinking about ordering a whole one for Christmas this year, if my family can make a decision on what flavor to pick!  They have so many cheesecake flavors, it's a long list... Lunch was great as always.  I highly recommend the Steak Diane, though on menu I thought it said $17.95, and my receipt was $19.95, so prices may have increased recently.  Hostess was Welcoming and I have a preference where I like to sit, which she gladly accommodated me.  My server was friendly, attentive, polite.  She did a great job and was helpful to kindly box up the leftovers.  The inside of the restaurant, design and colors are quite beautiful.  Hopefully will be back around December and Christmas shopping, definitely want a slice of Peppermint bark cheesecake too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=60

Kenny W.,"Suisun City, CA",448,118,46,2.0,11/23/2016,"The wait was ridiculous. When a place is this busy I think they should think about providing there customers with small cheese cake bites while waiting or offer water to those waiting in the lobby or in front. Or have a water location that is infused with fruits or something. Get creative. Hostess should update the top of the list ( 5 Names) how much longer so they can feel a little at ease while waiting instead of chit chatting among themselves and going on their phones. Which I get it we all do it. Wait times ruin the experiences at restaurants. Add a little candy or a water station to get customers to feel welcomed. I got water and totally forgot I was waiting long. Well not really, but it is worth a shot. The food was great. In this location. others not the same outcome.  Thank you Roseville, Cheesecake In response to Roseville Cheesecake. Yes we did go at a later time and have been in early and random times. I disagree and agree time can play a factor.

Rick B.,"Rocklin, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/6/2017,"#2 After receiving your reply to my less than stellar review from last evening, I can see that it was just going through the motions. I read all the other posts and see that when someone didn't receive the kind of service we all expect from Cheesecake factory or any other (non fast food) average chain restaurants, the replies are copy and pasted. The promise to address the issues and limit the experience to an isolated one, is obviously not being done properly or at all. Someone who truly understands customer service should be put on the payroll and some serious training of staff should occur. After my personal experience was mishandled by both the server and manager on duty, I write to you to open your eyes and expect to receive a little more than oops we are sorry and we will do better next time. I find that I am disappointed yet again.  How my situation should have been handled is: After I informed you that the food was not prepared properly, the Manager should have made sure it was perfect the second time. The 2nd plate should have been made fresh with all side dishes fresh as well. This didn't happen! The 2nd dish came out looking worse than the first and even less meat than the first dish had. It was sloppily presented as well. When I pointed this out to the Manager who personally delivered the second dish, He should have apologized again, asked if he could have 1 more chance to make it right and then he should have not charged me for that dish. To go a step even further, he could have given me his business card and wrote some type of goodwill gesture on the card. Perhaps a discount on the next visit or a free appetizer or something that goes beyond minimum effort! If you all want to improve your service, you need to think outside the box. I would have written a wonderful review and praised your actions, had you handled the situation better.  I live in Rocklin, there are many good restaurants around. You were on my list of better restaurants. Please get with the program and see to it that improvements are made. PLEASE!  #1 I am so disappointed in the service I received this evening. My family and I met for dinner. I arrived early and had a few martini's. Once my wife and daughter arrived we ordered dinner. I ordered the medallions medium rare. It arrived dry and gray in color. Very well done. I don't like to complain but wanted to enjoy the meal. I decided to mention the meat was overcooked to my waitress. Her reply......""Let me send it back, I didn't cook it!"" ??? What? My family tries to wait but didn't want to let their food get cold or soggy. They finished their meals. Finally a manager came over and apologized for the overcooked order. I mentioned the response I received from the waitress. The Manager said he would speak with her. 15 minutes later the manger hand delivered my newly cooked dish. The meat was again dry and gray in color. The mashed potatoes were dry and appeared to be from my original order. I hurried to cut two medallions in half showing the manager how the meat was cooked well done again. He looked at me with a look that told me he was done helping me. I said the meat is still over cooked and the meal appeared to be dry overall. I received a blank stare from the manager. I said we'll, I don't have more time to wait for yet another replacement meal. The manager just walked away. Soon after the waitress returned and stated; she was sorry for her remark and added usually people laugh at her remark that she didn't cook the meal. I looked at my wife and daughter in disbelief. Is this customer service at Cheesecake Factory? I think not!  ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=60

They were far too young and immature to be working at such nice restaurant as they treated their hostess job as it was simply a time to make fun of their customers. The group of hostesses were very condescending and made my party feel extremely unwelcome and uncomfortable.

Ordered my usual Steak Diane (cooked medium) and Chicken Madeira combo that came with mashed potatoes. The chicken was topped with sliced mushrooms and asparagus. This has always been my go-to here and has never failed me - including this time around. For dessert, I went with their seasonal and new Salted Caramel Cheesecake. The only reason why I had to take a star away was because the cheesecake had been overwhelmingly smothered with caramel sauce on the top - which made it a bit too sweet for my sweet tooth and absolute love for cheesecake (and that's a hard thing to say!). But overall, it was still good but I couldn't eat it on my own without having to share it with the others at my table since it was very sweet.

The Roseville location connected to the galleria mall always has great service. I love how the menu has SO many different items to choose from. My boyfriend and I usually order the Fried Macaroni and Cheese as our appetizer - we did again this time and the cook made it perfectly. As for the entree, I decided to try something different since it was a special occasion. I went with the Chicken Parmesan ""Pizza Style"", which was better than expected...I'm looking forward to the leftovers I have in the fridge. My boyfriend went with the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta without the peppers and he nearly finished his whole plate. We also got cheesecake - something we don't ever do - and it was SO good! I got the Oreo Dream Extreme while my bf had the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Both delicious (I, of course, had to have a bite of his).

Drew S.,"Roseville, CA",1,5,2,1.0,11/10/2014,"3-4 bites into her BBQ chicken salad, a member of our party bit into something that didn't seem right... It was the finger of a latex/polyurethane glove. It was the single most disgusting thing I have ever witnessed at a restaurant. The manager agreed to make her something else off of the menu and comp it, however the other 3 people who lost their appetites and were unable to finish their food were still charged. The diner who got the glove was even charged for her soda. Although the manager assured us that everyone in kitchen wears gloves, the question's swirling around our heads are: Did the cook have any cuts, scabs, etc? Was it a slice of the glove that caused it to be dropped in the salad? If so, was there any blood? It seems like a mistake of this level should have been handled with a bit more than a free quesadilla. I posted a photo of the glove on Cheesecake Factory's page. I guess it could have been worse, as it kind of looks like a condom in the photo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=160
May A.,"Roseville, CA",718,939,14068,5.0,1/11/2014,"I'm a fan! Have not been to a Cheesecake Factory ever anywhere! This would be my first time visit and dining here... I know! As much as I love food how could I have not tried this place before! Well, as I stepped in the huge double doors I'm thinking there must be a reason why this place is so packed each time... I mean, even the happy hour tables had a waiting list. There was an older couple who just walked in and took the table next to us that was supposed to be for our party and I heard them ask our server if it was reserved, she politely said that the table was taken and they had to move elsewhere or be on the waiting list. Felt bad for the couple. For us, last night, we had to wait about 20 min to get seated... that was okay because my friend and I were still waiting for 2 more friends to complete our party.  The host was friendly and our server was great! Her name was Kayla (I believe). As much as there were so many people dining that evening she was attentive to our table and always came at the right time. She must be used to serving this many people... great and friendly service!  Okay, I haven't even gotten to talking about my food yet! I have been preparing myself to come here... I printed their menu on-line! I know, nerd, right?! Anyway, I don't do spicy so I highlighted ones I thought might be interesting to the taste... it was hard to choose but I ordered the Avocado Eggrolls! Mmm! Love at first bite... and second, and third! I also wanted to try the Fried Macaroni and Cheese. My co-worker ordered it and gave me a sampling! Mmm! Love at first bite... unfortunately, I didn't have a second, nor third! Well, there's always a next time! Hmm, I didn't have a chance to order any cheesecake this time, although, another co-worker did and he ordered the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake and he gave me a teaser sample of that... yummy!!! I took pictures for Yelp and posted to FB and garnered many 'likes' and even a trail of conversations :) It was a fun evening! Great first time experience dining here (or any Cheesecake, for that matter). I only have one thing I didn't like, ready?!... although the ambiance was nice, the lighting (for me) was a bit dim! What can I say, I'm old. Luckily for me, I printed the menu online before coming to the restaurant... hehehe :) By the time we left around 6:30 the place was more full to the outside.

Jeanice S.,"Sacramento, CA",269,271,424,3.0,1/2/2016,"Food: I love their ribeye steak here. They are the only ones I've found that serve it on a place with some kind of juice that helps the meat stay juicy. Although, the steak does not stay warm throughout the whole time you're eating it, or maybe I'm just a slow eater, but there are some places that cook the steak with the plate so well that every bite of the steak is warm. I do like their pastas, but they got rid of the sun-dried tomatoes pasta, which was THE best pasta they had on their menu. I've tried a few of their pastas, and they're good but nothing out of the ordinary. Their french fries are crunchy and golden. They always serve two huge onion rings with the steaks, and it's OK. They side vegetables are plain. I ordered the string beans and broccoli once and they could have been cooked a little longer. Their PASSION FRUIT MOJITO is delicious! It has the right amount of everything in there. My boyfriend likes this location's food more than the Elk Grove location. Service: Sometimes we get a waiter that is great, sometimes we get a waiter that just isn't that happy. I don't come to this location much but the waiters seem not as cheerful as the ones in Elk Grove.  Price: The price is kind of expensive but then you do get a large amount.

Jason S.,"Roseville, CA",544,716,1845,4.0,4/28/2013,"I must say i really love the Saturday/Sunday brunch they have here...The key is there is not a ton of selection, but what they do have is dialed in. I personally like the pork chiqualla's they have served with eggs and homemade tortilla chips. This is not to mention sipping on some delicious mojito's or mimosa's. The selection is great with items like lemon ricotta pancakes (these are the bomb!), juevos rancheros, monte cristo and awesome fresh fruit and yogurt.  If in Roseville a definite place to hit up for brunch and if you are like the lady that sat by us at brunch you can skip past all the food and go straight to ordering cheese cake which this place is known for. If you have lived for the amount of time that you have and not allowed yourself to be pleasured by some cheesecake from here STOP! Make this a reality in the next 10 days...best cheesecake selection on the planet. if you can dream up they have it red velvet(yes), carmel apple pie (yes), key lime (yes and one of my personal favs), Plain (yes, but why) , strawberry and this is soooo good! (yes), turtle (yes)...you get it!  BTW...just in case you have been living in another universe other than earth they also have a great dinner and lunch selection. My personal favs are the jambalaya and the lemon roasted chicken.

Even though the Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that some people might snub their noses at, I couldn't be more impressed at the visually appealing décor of Egyptian and Art Deco combinations of the interior!  It actually took my breath away, because this is my kind of taste!  I knew then and there that I was going to love this place no matter what!   The menus are extensive with food selections that would appeal to every appetite.  Even so, cheesecake was always in the back of my mind.  But we didn't want to feel too guilty by not eating something more substantial, so my boyfriend and I decided on eating some healthy salads first.  Our waitress Natalie was very nice and had a fun sense of humor as she guided us through the menu as first timers of this restaurant.  Our meals began with huge glasses of Diet Coke and ice tea with some hot, fresh breads and butter.  Then we ordered an appetizer of their popular Avocado egg rolls with an accompaniment of a sweet tasting dipping sauce.  Everything was perfect right from the start!   The main course: I ordered the Carlton Salad, while Joe K ordered the Luau Salad.  I couldn't believe the huge portions that were piled on our plates!  My salad was very good and had plenty of Romaine lettuce, grilled white meat chicken, feta cheese, avocado, dried cranberries, raisins, pears, oranges and pecans tossed in a vinaigrette dressing.  On the other hand, my boyfriend had the Luau Salad, but didn't seem as impressed with his, stating that it lacked some of the ingredients and flavor he was expecting this salad to contain.   Eventually, I had to stop eating salad or I wouldn't have room for dessert, so I got the rest to go.  The exciting finale arrived as we ordered the cheesecake!  I got the Caramel Pecan Turtle and bf got the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut.  I didn't want to slice into these mouth-watering works of art, but forced myself anyway!  The combinations of chocolates, fudge, caramel, nuts and creamy cheesecake just can't be described in writing.  You'll just have to try it yourself!  Now I know why they named this restaurant after its heavenly desserts!  A great marketing tool that will draw in cheesecake lovers like me into becoming a continuous patron!                 My dreaded business mini trip to Rocklin, CA couldn't have turned out to be more of a successful and fun filled day that was highlighted by eating at the Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=160

I know - what a weird mix of flavors but i love the ingredients in the Mexican Tortilla and the flavors in the wasabi vinaigrette. They got rid of the wasabi vinaigrette for a while but I'm glad i asked for it because it's back! i don't think they sell it up front for take home - but honestly - even if they did who can finish a huge jar in 5-7 days unless they are having a party right? This salad runs like $13.99 or $14.99 - a bit pricey for let's be honest - a salad. I do love how they have the variety of bread and butter for the table - that's a highlight since there's usually 2-3 kinds of bread :) yum.

I arrived with a party of four during lunch rush and waited 20 minutes in an overcrowded waiting area to be seated. We were seated awkwardly in the middle of two other parties. we ended up being here for three hours simply because our server Austin neglected us the entire time and took exceedingly long to bring us our food. My friend ordered the mushroom burger without the beef because she is a vegetarian and he said ok got it! Next thing you know he brings a burger with beef in it, after everyone around us who ordered after us already got there food, and we had to send it back. When we tried to get our check so we could leave he completely ignored us and did not even ask if we wanted desert. We had to tell him ourselves. The couple next to us even noticed how poorly he was treating us and said that we were doing the right thing being nice because maybe he is just having a bad day. If that's the case maybe he should choose a different profession? Also, The garlic noodles were the worst I ever had!

They do not take reservations, but we were able to put our name down for a table about an hour before the party started.  The staff was very accommodating and put several small tables together in one area to fit our group. We were able to order off the lunch menu still since the party started around 4:00 pm. They allowed us to bring our own cake too. If you slice the cake yourself, there is no slicing fee. They did not rush our party and the service was fabulous with the server checking to refill waters often.  The staff even came over to sing to my daughter. Very nice !!  And when were leaving, I needed a better box to take the remainder of the cake home, and they kindly escorted me to the bakery section and provided me with one of their very nice bakery boxes!

People diss the whole chain thing but theyre amazingly consistent if you like their food. Shrimp scampi and a bbq burger were out late night eats. Also started with the fried calamari which was cooked perfectly. How many places have i gone where the squid is over and rubbery? I shudder to think. They were spot on. Same with the burger mid rare.

They were very rude, and they acted as if they didn't like their customers nor their job. Not one time during my lunch did I see them smile or act accommodating towards the guests.

She asked the chef and came  back and said something about using different batters and ingredients.

It took forever to get menus, get beverages, food, check on us, wait for bill, etc.  I ordered ""Renee's Special"", which is a sandwich, soup & salad. The bread was extremely hard. If you have false or loose teeth, I wouldn't recommend it. It took a lot of effort to bite into it. They also don't put cheese on a turkey sandwich, which was weird. The turkey was also dry. The salad was soggy, but the dressing (Chinese Plum) was pretty good. I will say, the stuffed mushroom appetizers are great. But I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.

The hostess said we would have to wait 10-15 minutes for our table. I went to the ladies room in the meantime and i passed numerous open tables both in the bar and restaurant section. What's the deal with this? Don't they want customers to be served right away? I really don't get it. This particular location is not that busy compared to the others. I'm not surprised that this is the case after my last visit to this restaurant.  Now for the food, we knew what we wanted so we ordered our food right away but it took the server 20 minutes to give us bread as ""they ran out and they are making fresh bread, as we speak"".

Food portions are large for most people. Enough to have leftovers more than not. Dishes are seasoned and at times a little much on spice but not to completely ruin. Bread is warm and refilled respectively. Beverages are periodically refilled appropriately. Dessert to purchase is offered.

I liked how there was a light menu (under 590 calories) so that way I don't feel as guilty when I eat their cheesecake lol. There's also bread to snack on while you wait for your food.

She told the waitress that we had gotton into a fight and I left her there all by herself and she only had 40+ dollars on her and that wouldn't cover the bill but she was more than willing to work off the rest. The waitress told her to keep her money so she could get a ride home and will have the manager void the bills.

Micki M.,"Sacramento, CA",422,617,5201,5.0,5/15/2014,"Came here to celebrate my birthday on Mother's Day weekend. Since they don't accept reservations or call ahead seating, we arrived a half an hour early to wait for a table for nine of us. As expected, the place was packed! But then again, this place is always packed. But, we were able to get a table in about forty minutes, not bad considering it's Mother's Day weekend.  While we waited for others to arrive, we waited at a table in the bar. Adam, our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. While hubs ordered his usual adult beverage, Long Island, I wanted something different, Adam knew that I was indecisive, he gave me some suggestions, and when I decided on one he didn't recommend, he suggests the Passion Fruit Margarita. When my drink arrived, it was delicious! Something new, out of my norm, nice change!  When the rest of our party arrived, we were seated in the patio area, at first I was reluctant, it was a windy day but it was very tolerable, since the table was closest to the building. Madison, was our server for the dining area and she was phenomenal. She was very professional, expedient, and attentive.  It took our party a lengthy amount of time deciding what to eat, especially me. There's over twenty pages in their menu with a variety of entrees, salads, apps, sandwiches, burgers, and desserts. I like that there's a bit of almost every internationally inspired dish here. There's Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Greek, Japanese, and American. With so many choices, it was super difficult to make a decision. On this visit, we had Moroccan chicken, bistro shrimp, meatloaf, fish n' chips, lemon chicken, miso glazed salmon, french dip, teriyaki chicken and flat bread pizza. Everything was delicious. I tasted my brother's Moroccan chicken on a bed of cous cous, it was really good. I had to sample the ever popular miso glazed salmon and that was phenomenal! The salmon was grilled to perfection with a crusty outer exterior. Seasoned to perfection. I think I'll be ordering that on my next visit. The teriyaki chicken was yummy as well, I had asked my daughter if she was sure about her choice because she is very finicky about her teriyaki chicken. She had it before,  therefore she was adamant in her choice. She made an excellent choice, loved the presentation including grilled plantains.

A mojito will set you back $11.50. A slice of cheesecake starts about $8.  Now I don't mind emptying my pocketbook for dinner because I LOVE food, but after dining here again and again I have come to the conclusion: it's just not worth it. It is NOT bad, but I never find myself craving it either. When reminded of the prices after a recent visit, I'm just not impressed. Our service was less than average. It wasn't bad, but it was the kind of service that makes you irritated that tipping 18% is customary in our country. For an addition 18% on top of already overpriced food, I would like impressive service. Unfortunately I didn't find that here. Our waiter was busy, I'll give him that, but more specifically I felt he was distracted. We didn't get ignored and service wasn't bad, it simply wasn't anything beyond sufficient.  To summarize: In my opinion Cheesecake Factory is overpriced average food served in a very unmemorable fashion. Now, lunch time and happy hour is another story.

It seems as though they assign too many tables to their wait staff.The delays for getting drinks, refills on drinks, bread dropped off, and paying the bill leaves us looking around like ""where on earth could the waiter be?""

The pasta carbonara was soooo good. My absolute fave thing there now. Not really a big fan of the chipotle pasta anymore. The chicken was a bit dry. The fried calamari is always good! I love the calamari at Cheesecake Factory! Always my favorite. But the crab bites were gross. It was so dry and hard and not as good as the normal crab cakes. It was such small pieces and didn't taste much crab. Granted it was only around $6 or $7, I would rather pay full price for the normal crab cakes.  The service was ok.

The zucchini was delicious but the deep fried avocado was a miss as far as we are concerned. $6.50 sausage flat bread pizza, this seemed smaller and more expensive, but still tasty, probably not worth $6.50 any longer though. $3.50-$4 or so Strawberry Lemonade: this was crazy good, not to sweet not to tart with free refills a huge hit.

I was seated and forgotten until he arrived 40 minutes later. I knew he'd be late, but I expected to be checked on by staff. No bread. No asking if I wanted to order anything while I waited. The waitress brought me water and never returned. Even after he arrived, she only checked on us once. No drink refills. Just felt pushed out.  2) Food portions: my favorite dish is the Lemon herb chicken dish. Still is. But the portions were half what they normally are! I've noticed it getting smaller, but this was ridiculous. One time, while big and pregnant, they brought this dish and the chicken was raw!!! I had to send it back, which I very rarely do.

Jenni T.,"Roseville, CA",346,970,7114,3.0,10/20/2013,"If I was comparing The Cheesecake Factory to other chain restaurants, then it's about average. If I was comparing it to local restaurants, then I would stay away. Food- 2.5/5. For the money you get HUGE portions. Please take half of it home! Or don't eat anything else for three days. Your choice. I honestly can't really find anything here that I particularly like with the exception of two things. The cheesecake is really good and they have a ton of flavors so it kind of doesn't even taste like cheesecake sometimes which is good. Cause I don't really like cheesecake. The other thing is the ranch dressing. Yes, that's right, they have the best ranch dressing I have ever tested. Hard to believe right? I still have not found anything to compare. Other than those two things, everything else is eh. The Grilled Cheese is edible, salads are OK, nachos are fine, the garlic noodles are gross, and well, that's about all the vegetarian options. My Husband loves their Shepherds Pie which he gets every time we come here. Either it is that good, or he likes nothing else.  Atmosphere- 5/5. The restaurants are always so beautiful. Nicely painted, interesting light fixtures, comfy booths, etc. great for a night or with the family or date. Service- 4/5. I don't think I've ever had bad service here. There always seems to be enough people working and they are attentive.  Vegetarian Friendliness- 2/5. As mentioned above, there are only a few things on a menu with 30 pages for vegetarians. Kind of disappointing! And they are just the basics too, grilled cheese, salad, nachos, etc. You would think they would have more inventive dishes considering the menu. Overall- 2.5/5. If I had a choice between The Cheesecake Factory and another chain restaurant, I may pick The Cheesecake Factory. Or not. If I had a choice between The Cheesecake Factory and pretty much any local restaurant in town, I would eat local and save 3000 calories while doing it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=220

The portion was huge which was cool to look at, but the patty destroyed it.  Absolutely the worst veggie burger i have ever tasted.  And to be fair everyone else at my table enjoyed their food.

Joe K.,"Sacramento, CA",731,610,440,4.0,2/26/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory was my next stop on my quest for the best salad in Sacramento.  Believe it or not, my girl friend and I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  We both liked the large roomy interior which kind of reminded me of something you might see at Disneyland. We were promptly seated in a nice comfortable booth next to a window (I guess we just live right) where our waitress took our drink orders and gave us extensive menus that resembled children's books in both size and the thickness of the pages.  We were in no way intimidated by the size of these menus and immediately found our way to the lunch salad specials.  (It helps to be on a quest.) I think the waitress was quite surprised when she returned with our drinks and we already had decided on our orders.  We shared an avocado eggroll appetizer, Ida ordered a Carlton Salad and I ordered a Luau Salad.  The avocado eggroll was so damn good and I must admit that it set me up extremely well for the disappointment they called the Luau Salad. The chicken they use on their salads is a bit on the disgusting side.  It has kind of a boiled gelatinous texture and is completely void of any resemblance of flavor.  The rest of the salad was mostly lettuce with barely a touch of each of the vegetables they had mentioned on the menu.  The fried wontons were good and the dressing was good but they were not even close to being enough to save this boring mound of mediocrity.  I could barely even taste the meager distribution of sesame seeds that was my reason for ordering the Luau Salad in the first place. Now for the good part:  What do you do when you go to the Cheesecake Factory?  You eat Cheesecake.  I ordered a slice of White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake and Ida ordered a slice of Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake.  I am surprised they don't have the paramedics standing by.   You should have seen the size of those slices of cheesecake.  They were rather large and very rich and decadently topped with whipped cream.  I think I must have gained ten pounds before I even took a bite.  Oh; but it was a wonderful ten pounds indeed. My suggestion would be to order the avocado eggrolls and the cheesecake.  Skip the salad, it is a complete waste of calories. P.S.  Our waitress was wonderful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=220

My new favorite. My husband and I really like Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - a very rich and flavorful Thai style dish, too mild as for the thai style though. The small appetizer salads are great too and cheap! I've tried every single one of them and they were yummy. Also, CF has the best mashed potatoes of all places in town!

First - the service is not the fastest.  If you know what you want when you order your drinks, I recommend you do it - otherwise you won't get it for a while. It isn't  a terrible wait - but I believe this place is under staffed.  Once you order your food, service seems a bit normal. Second - if you have kids, get the ""kids plate""... I didn't even realize they had this, but the hostess asked me if we wanted it.  All it is is 4 pieces of bread and some banana slices.  This makes this place worth the money alone! You know how many restaurants I go to just hoping my kid doesn't freak out while in his high-chair.  The kids plate will keep him entertained until you get your food )my kid is 18 months, BTW). Lastly - a food review. Typically I order the skinnylicious soft tacos... which are basically 3 tacos which are really, really good.  If you order their normal size plate, it is inly 3 dollars more and you get FOUR tacos and rice/beans.

Richard P.,"San Jose, CA",3,250,,2.0,6/12/2015,"Richard Pro here with another review. Cheesecake Factory looks incredible. That's a given. Your servers are professional. Booths are comfy. The interior is stunning, but lighting could be more generous. Portion sizes are extremely reasonable . . . but when we talk about taste, that's where Cheesecake Factory falls flat. The dishes are overly greasy and buttery. The flavors are usually overkill with sauces that are too heavy or creamy or tangy or whatever. There's no fusion of flavor, there's just one overpowering element in any dish you order that kills it.  The cheesecake is exceptional, but at $7 a slice, I don't think I can stomach it.  Won't return on my own, but it's a nice place to catch up with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=240

I usually don't refill my water if I know that I wont finish what is already in my glass.

Charles N.,"Rocklin, CA",0,19,2,1.0,2/23/2015,"I'm really sorry to have to do this, because all of my prior experience with cheese cake factory has been great.  To begin with, they somehow put our reservation on ""hold"", meaning that they had called our name but we hadn't responded. However, we had been sitting or standing right in front of the hostess station the entire time.  So instead of the 20 minute wait we were told in the beginning, it turned out to be closer to 40. It was still a 20 minute wait after we cleared that up. I think this mixup was in part due to the young females hostesses spending far too much time chatting with each other- something management needs to pay attention to.  The very worst part and the reason for the one star. Service was excellent, the food came promptly. I ordered the Shepherds Pie, and it seemed to taste ok. However, within less than an hour I was home and terribly sick. Not to be rude but it was coming out of both ends if you catch my meaning.  Unfortunately I've had food poisoning before, and I know exactly how it feels.

Pair it with their awesome iced green tea and a seat out on the patio, and it's some kind of paradise.  The service I received wasn't necessarily attentive, our server was much more occupied with the table of obviously wealthy women next to us as opposed to the my group of twenty-somethings.

I usually order the chicken and shrimp jumbo! They give you a decent amount of meat, but not proportionate to the size of rice they give you. I also recommend their bang bang chicken and shrimp!

I believe it was 30-45 minutes. Tonight I took my mom out dinner. She had the lettuce wraps, wow this was a big portion plate. I asked if it was the sampler platter because it had many different types of lettuce and about 6-7 total, each one generously filled. She really liked her dish and plenty  leftover for tomorrow's lunch! I had the Miso salmon, a little bit smaller then what I usually get else where, and $2 more. However, it was Yummy...this was a very simple dish with great flavor, if you like it sweet. But then, who doesn't like it sweet  you get your choice of white or brown rice, I chose brown. They laid the Miso salmon over the bed of rice, then laid snow peas around the bed of rice.Next time I will ask for more snow peas, or maybe a side of veggies, because they only give you about 6 snow peas total. Finally, they topped it off with a tasty white wine cream sauce, yum, I'm almost ready for some more. We couldn't shut it down with out the cheesecake! Because we were stuffed, we decided to share a slice of the red velvet cheesecake. I liked it, but now I'm over it, it tasted more like a whipped cream cake, then the traditional solid cheesecake that I've come to love! Oh well, I'll try something different next time.

I used to love going to this chain restaurant that is loved by pretty much everyone and it is a disappointment I have to write a negative review.  We went around 9pm and it wasn't busy at all. We were seated quickly but after that it was horrible, slow service. Our waitress took forever to take our drink and appetizer order!  We got our appetizer- the Crab Wontons- which were actually delicious and ate them. It took us about 20 minutes to eat them and we realized the waitress still hasn't came by to take our order even though she walked by countless times. It was an additional 15 minutes before my fiancé had to flag her down. He ordered the classic hamburger and I ordered a Caesar salad with added grilled shrimp. It came out in a timely matter- but the food was nasty. My shrimp was dry and there was hardly any dressing on the salad. The dressing was also bland and I had to send my salad back because I could not eat it. The waitress then became very rude and had attitude. My fiancé also didn't finish his food- his hamburger was dry and tasteless. I was surprised how a chef could ruin a simple salad and hamburger. I am not sure this horrible service and food was because it was late and the employees were not having it- but I will never go here again.

Michael C.,"Sacramento, CA",22,12,,2.0,9/19/2015,"Went here on a Thursday night with four other people.  I ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, huge fail.  There was 6 half rolls that looked like a five year old had rolled them, only 2 of the six actually had shrimp in them, This may have been a blessing in disguise as the shrimp still had the shells on them. Very disappointing. On the bright side, the sauces that came with them were wonderful.  For our entrees, three of us ordered the Steak Diane (all medium rare). One came out medium rare, the other two were medium well. All were horribly under seasoned.  About 10 minutes after we ordered we were informed that there was a shortage of mashed potatoes and were asked if there was a side dish that they could substitute for the mashed. I said that I wanted the mashed and didn't want a substitution. Another five minutes goes by and the waiter comes to our table to inform us that they now have found some mashed potatoes and all was right with the world, that is until I tried them and found that they had large chunks of uncooked potatoes in them (argh!).  The other person in our party ordered a burger and fries which wasn't too bad except for the fries which are large fresh cut fries much like In & Out Burger serves just a bit thicker.  And just like In & Out fries they are great when they are hot, but five minutes later when they cool off a bit, they become incredibly nasty.

It was an hour and 10 minutes. Meanwhile almost all other parties were seated before us. I complained twice. By the third time, we were ALL pretty perturbed. They finally sat us, where we sat for over an hour before we got our meals. The trouble goes on and on. I had to go to the social station (oh, I mean the server station) to tell someone to send the manager over, but that was a joke. Nothing changed except that 4 servers brought our meals. After that, we went back on ignore. I can't stress how aggravating that was. With that many people extremely unhappy and very hungry before they even get seated, get out of social mode and GET TO WORK!

This wasn't a big deal as we decided to go early and put our names down in case in was busy...It was of course but we had a lot of time to kill. It was a nice plus to see that instead of waiting with the masses inside the restaurant they give you the options of text messages while you walk the mall. The final wait Til was over an hour and half, no surprise there, but by that time we were just happy to get a table. Our waitress was surprise nice and super quick, got our bread and drinks out almost instantly.

We ordered two, the pineapple upside down cake and white chocolate raspberry. I can't complain about either, both were delicious and a great ending to the meal.    The menu is a little overwhelming with so many choices.

As for the service...it was FANTASTIC!  Hank was our server, and he made my mother-in-law feel extra special, putting on the charm with her, having other servers come out and sing Happy Birthday to her, that kinda thing.  Is some of it a put-on, or is he just *that* happy of a person?  Honestly, I think he's just a happy dude that puts his all into the job.  Does it hurt with the tips?  Hell no. lol  He's really nice, though, AND thorough; he doesn't write anything down--how does he do it?  I can barely remember my own order.  ;)  He was speedy, remembered drink refills, and was always charming & funny while doing it.

Alexandra K.,"Chico, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/4/2015,"I went to the Galleria Cheesecake Factory for lunch this past Saturday (May 2, 2015) with 2 of my friends. We ordered the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer, which were good. Then I ordered their mushroom chicken lettuce wraps as my meal. When my plate was delivered, there were multiple bugs (very small) crawling all over the lettuce that was served with my meal. I immediately had the waitress return the plate to the kitchen, and did not order an additional lunch plate. As someone who is ServSafe and HACCP certified, this is incredibly alarming and a clear indication that this establishment is not following proper procedures and protocol for their food preparation.  The waitress had the manager come and apologize for the ""inconvenience"". The manager did not seem genuinely apologetic for the incident, and did not make an effort to rectify the situation. Generally, restaurants with excellent customer service would offer some form of incentive to return to the establishment after an experience like this, but the manager did not.  This poor customer service and clear lack of food safety precautions will result in me not returning to this establishment. I also intend on writing to their corporate office to let them know about this experience.

We got seated and got greeted by our waitress and her name was Emily. We were already ready to order when she first came and after that she never came back to our table.

She was also serving the table right next to us and every time she came to their table and asked them how everything was doing I made eye contact with her but she just literally ignored me. She even had time to refill their water and clear their plates and even got them a box. We sat there for about 15-20 minutes just waiting for her to come by again to get her attention .

Cheesecake Factory definitely topped my expectations in terms of service, but just met my expectations of food (excluding the cheesecake, of course!).  Ambience is one you'd expect from an American food chain restaurant. Dimly lit on the inside with a mediocre sound level. Not quite formal, and not quite homey. Our server was very nice and friendly, so no complaints there.  A tip on their food - their avocado eggrolls appetizer is absolutely delicious! It is a must try on anyone's dinner menu. All other foods are so-so, nothing quite so memorable. Cheesecake is delicious as expected, but I'd have to warn that I'm a rather boring eater sometimes. I always go for the original cheesecake (or the strawberry topped one), so I wouldn't bet on my cheesecake experience as a reliable review.

THE FOOD:  I ordered the seared tuna salad for $16.95.  Considering the huge portions that the Cheesecake Factory is know for I was expecting a good amount of tuna for the price right?  Well I was very dissapointed with the 5 very thinly sliced pieces about 1x1 1/2 inches each.  Also, the picture online shows sesame crusted tuna, this only had a spicy seasoining that tasted just like Tony Chachere's which was too much.  The dressing was tasty and overall it was edible but dissapointing.  I would not order it again. My husband had the BBQ salmon with corn succotash and mashed potatoes for $15.95.  He loved it and it was a big portion.  I tasted the salmon and potatoes and both were great. The other three enjoyed their meals but I did not taste them. I didn't hear them saying they were particularly wowed by their meals and one said the food was overly salty... We had cheesecake for dessert and I remember the slices being larger in the past, especially for $6.95.  Not worth it. The service was excellent and timed pretty well. As we were leaving, on the way out the hostess said, and this is an exact quote:  ""Thanks for leaving...

The amount I signed for was voided out and my card was charged for the full check amount without my permission.

They are honestly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, and the boyfriend and I crave these things daily now! Fried Zucchini (appetizer) - these were for me since my boyfriend doesn't eat vegetables. I'm a huge fan of fried zucchini, and these were the best I've tried so far.  Fettuccine Alfredo (meal) - probably not the best fettuccine alfredo I've ever had but it was still pretty good. Crusted Chicken Romano (meal) - this is basically like chicken parmigiana. Breaded chicken breasts over tomato cream sauce and noodles. It was pretty good as well. Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake (dessert) - couldn't have asked for a better tasting birthday ""cake"". I love love LOVE pineapple upside down cake so this was perfect for me.  Honestly, this place has a great atmosphere, great service, and delicious food. The menu selection is enormous, so there really is something for everyone. The cheescake, no matter what flavor you get, is delicious. Highly highly recommend.

We have a 2 year old and an infant and the we've had some really good experiences there. We've gone twice in the past two weeks and were really happy both times. My son always gets the corn dogs and fries kids meal. The corn dogs are made from fresh in the kitchen, not frozen and heated.  On one night, my husband ordered the steak diane and they accidentally brought him a similar dish. We thought they changed the dish but the manager came out a few minutes later and apologized for the mixup (without us even mentioning it). We told him we were fine but he insisted on giving us the steak diane as a to go meal. I've been ordering the ahi tuna salad off the skinnylicious menu and I love it.

I haven't had any issues with wait time either, and am usually able to get a table within minutes (granted, the last 3 times I've been here have been for weekend lunches). The food is fine. Their menu is humongous, so it's hard too choose what to order if you're the indecisive type.

Asked for another table and was informed that none was available.  We got up and wslked out, and went to another resturant, Mimi's and enjoyed a really good meal and much better sesting. Maybe that table location would not have been such a big problem, but when your 6'4"" you would think that the hostess would take that into consideration.  Will never return to this place again and will pass on the gift card on to the trash can.

I had: Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - $15.95 (Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce.) Fried Zucchini - $3.95 (Lightly Breaded and Served with Ranch Dressing.)

Diet Coke - $2.95 (Easy ice) The deep fried zucinni were coated with a light crispy, crunchy batter and served hot with a special ranch dressing dip.  The pasta was very good and cooked al dente.

Annette H.,"Rocklin, CA",79,262,618,4.0,7/9/2016,"Nice location, beautiful interior. We received a generous gift card from a family member last year so we've been going to this Cheesecake Factory off and on to use up the balance. The menu is HUGE and takes a while to read through.  Since my husband just had oral surgery, we needed super soft foods so we figured soup and cheesecake might be the way to go.   Got a clam chowder bowl to share (which was a HUGE bowl!!).  It had a lot of big pieces of clam.  Pretty good.  Maybe a little on the saltier side but maybe that's why they give you bread. Husband got the California omelette, which didn't come with any additional protein so he opted to add chicken.  We also substituted the breakfast potatoes for mashed potatoes instead (since those would be easier for him to eat without chewing too much).  We didn't know this till the end but that ends up being a pretty pricey omelette at $13.50 plus $3.50 = $17.  Glad we had the gift card! I got a Cobb salad with honey mustard on the side.  It was great!   We got a bunch of desserts to-go to use up the gift card:  red velvet cheesecake, lemon raspberry cheesecake (recommended by our server), Godiva cheesecake and the chocolate layer cake (not sure the exact name).  The two chocolate desserts are amazing.  The other two, not sure we'd get again.  They were just ok. Servers were great, food was good.  Only downsides are the prices can be high (our entire meal cost us around $90, including tip!), AND they are super busy on Friday evenings and weekends.  Our wait on a Friday evening was about 20 min, which wasn't too bad but as we were leaving around 7:30pm, the place was packed with people waiting.  This location seems considerably smaller than the Arden one. I'd come back again if we got another gift card, and I'd try to come at off-peak hours to avoid the crowds.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=40

I only hate half of what was on my plate, and also saved an entire serving of black beans untouched specifically to take home with me. When I asked our server for a box so that I could take everything on my plate home, he insisted to box my food for me, so I said okay. I was disappointed today to see that only half of my food was actually boxed, and the entire bowl of beans that was on my plate was nowhere to be seen.

I ordered the ribeye steak because on my first visit the ribeye was superb! I said ribeye medium no onions. I got what looked like ribeye soup. my steak was drowning in what I call liguid au jus because being a meatcutter for 47yrs there no steak that gives you a cup and a half of natural juice. I ate the steak to not cause embarrassment to my boss. In all fairness the other two meals said were good. I love a great steak with no au jus so i'll just pay premium and go to Ruth Chris.

Our server was friendly and was able to answer a couple questions about the menu, but we barely saw her the whole meal. When she was actually at our table, she was always in a hurry to run off and forgot anything she didn't write down. Waited ten minutes to order drinks, waited another ten to actually get them and when she dropped them off she put them all on the edge of the table and ran off before we could say a word. That's not a huge deal but really? Food took longer than usual and we weren't able to get more bread/refills because she didn't come back until some of the food was out, and learned only then that one of the entrees was missing. Asked for bread again, and again, and finally got it as we were leaving. I get it, it's a Saturday night and it's busy, but honestly tonight's service just felt lazy and the lack of it turned what should have been a 45 minute dinner into at least an hour and a half.

Food: If you can't agree on one type or genre of food, TCF is perfect because it has pretty much everything and there is something for everyone. Ambiance: An upscale yet casual place full of families and couples that's good for a birthday dinner, first date or a quick meal. Only hang up, is parking can be difficult especially if the mall is busy. Service: Servers are friendly and fairly knowledgeable considering all the items on the menu. The bartenders at this location are great too. Price: $10 - $30 depending on what you order, but more then likely, there will be leftovers for your next meal.

My friend wanted her 30th birthday party of 18 girls to be at the Yard House which just opened down the street (doesn't take reservations).  She didn't make reservations, however, she had all of us going there at 7pm on a Saturday night with her husband there at 5pm reserving the table for us.  Guess what - the Yard House couldn't accommodate us. It's now 6:30pm on a Saturday night and we have 18 women heading to the Roseville area from the bay area, foothills and Sacramento.  WHAT TO DO? We called BJs Restaurant - nothing. We called The Cheesecake Factory in the Gallaria and spoke to this wonderful manager that said ""well I wont have anything available until about 7:15p and it would have to be outside."" Well, what he didn't know is we wanted outdoor seating and waiting 15 minutes was nothing!  WOW I was in shock!  We sent the husband over there to show the manager that we were serious about 18 people and BAM they made it happen! I feel so bad that I don't remember our servers name but we had ONE server for 18 women and OH MY GOSH she was FANTASTIC! I upgraded this 4 star review to 5 because our server was amazing!  I've never seen one server serve a table of 18 PLUS other tables with such grace and skill!  She was never late on anything, nothing was wrong with the order, the drinks came out in timely fashion... she was awesome!  The complimentary cheesecake for our birthday girl was an added treat and we loved the outdoor location! The Georgia Peach drink is super yummy!

Their cheesecake wasn't too bad either, but for $8 a slice, I could have gotten an entire cheesecake at Safeway that tasted better.  The atmosphere was like a badly decorated Vegas casino- and just as loud! No offense, if that's your style. It's not mine.  We ordered several things to try just because the menu was so huge there must be something this place excels at, right? Wrong. The food is WAY overpriced for the mediocre crap you get. The broccoli was not even steamed correctly. It was like crudités that sat in the back of the fridge for a couple weeks until they were kind of limp, then warmed briefly before being served as ""steamed veggies"". The pasta was ""eh"", the potatoes sucked, and the appetizers were gross. You know how Chef Ramsay always says pick a limited menu and excel at that, because you can't be good at a bunch of random items? He was right. I wish he would do a Kitchen Nightmares episode at The Cheesecake Factory. I can't believe people actually enjoy eating here. I can't believe this place is still in business.

Especially in Sacramento where most restaurants are SO inconsistent, and often disappointing.  There is NO place you can order such a wide vareity of palate pleasing food at such (relative to the quality) low prices!  Most of the time I order my personal favorites, lettuce wraps/scampi/pizettes/steak diane which are always excellent, but tonight I tried their chicken and shrimp gumbo with andouille sausage. The flavor of this dish was indescribable, but simply delicious! The combination of different flavors were truly like a party in my mouth, I realize this sounds silly, but if you've ever been so fortunate you know what I'm talking about!

We finally got our 3 appetizers about 30+ minutes later...appetizers mind you... Our waitress was too busy having meaningless convesations with anyone who even looked remotely in her direction. She did not bring us our food, nor did she refill our beverages herself. There were about 4 tables, including us in her station.  We ended up finishing, and wanted to share a piece of cheesecake but by the time she finally got around to us it was after 6pm and we had to drop cash and leave. We were 1/2 hour late to our concert b/c she was so slow. Annoying!!! 1.5 hours to get a round of drinks and 3 appetizers. This waitress needs to learn to step it up or step out.

I will spare you the details, but believe me when I say it was HORRIBLE!!!! Over 48 hours later & I'm still recovering. No one else got sick & I was the only one who ate my shrimp so I'm guessing that was the culprit. I called to let the manager know & he was apologetic. He took my address & I'm guessing he's going to try & lure me back with a gift card or something. Even with a gift card in hand it would be hard to forget this experience & muster up the courage to eat here again. To be fair, I know you can get food poisoning anywhere.

When calling in for pick up they always ""put you on a short hold"" to transfer you to bakery, which is fine. But when it comes to the service inside when picking up your food it depends on when you come in. If you go in the middle of the day its hit or miss. Sometimes the people in the bakery are aware of someone standing at the counter and other times they have their backs to you, so you have to call out for help. On weekends.......forget about it!! They hardly even pay attention to you. Even the people at the front counter dont even bother to ask if you need help or not.

Tina F.,"San Clemente, CA",209,160,81,4.0,11/6/2011,"Shrimp bistro pasta was so good! Love the desserts , late night closing schedule and the good service.  A few months ago, we also had dinner there and I didn't like what I ordered - curry something. It had dessicated coconut instead of coconut milk mixed in the curry sauce. I abhor dessicated coconut even as a kid.  Now, to mix such an ingredient to a curry dish is just pure laziness! I love the taste of fresh coconut milk in curry sauces but I do understand that to keep costs down they need to have an alternative ingredient. Now, coconut powder mixed in with water also tastes almost as good as the fresh ones. They could have used that instead of dessicated coconut. It was gross! Our server noticed that I barely touched my food and I told her that I didn't like it. She replaced my order with a pasta dish.

Lindsey C.,"Roseville, CA",89,104,125,4.0,5/29/2013,"Crispy fried cheese, taquitos, french fries, BBQ chopped chicken salad, and lemon raspberry cheesecake. All some of my favorite items at the cheesecake factory and all are pretty much completely unhealthy. Still good nonetheless. Cheesecake factory has pretty much turned into my family's go-to pick for birthday lunches/dinners, casual family dinners, as well as a popular pick when I go on date nights with my sister.  I almost always start with an order of crispy fried cheese, which is mozzarella cheese that comes shaped as triangles with marinara sauce on the side. (I always ask for a side of ranch because who doesn't like fried cheese dipped in ranch?) The BBQ chicken salad at Cheesecake is delicious: romaine lettuce with veggies, chicken, bbq ranch dressing topped with onion straws. When I come to Cheesecake Factory I normally come with the predetermined idea that I going to indulge, so with my salad, I ruin any chance of healthiness by order a side of french fries. The french fries that they serve are some of the greatest fries that I have ever had. How do they get them that perfectly golden and crispy? Now if I am at Cheesecake for a birthday party or some other form of a celebratory event I go for the lemon raspberry cheesecake. There is NO other cheesecake that compares. It is not overly sweet and the tangy raspberry sauce that the slice sits on makes it even more delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=420
Marie N.,"Sacramento, CA",317,272,129,3.0,1/5/2011,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory on Arden before and my review then probably would have been a 4-star, mostly because I had never been there before and I was easily impressed by my dinner and the awesomely long cheesecake menu.   The food here is good, not spectacular, but good.   I ordered the Hibachi Steak which came with Wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus.  I do believe that the small and slightly green tinted puddle on top of my potatoes was meant to be the Wasabi... but I tasted nothing of the sort.  Bummer.  My steak chunks were decent, and the asparagus was tasty (although more than two pieces would have been cool, yannow?).  I tried the Tiramisu Cheesecake for the first time, and it was just ok.  Plenty creamy but not much coffee or liquor flavor. Drinks are overpriced and I should have known that any cocktail with the word ""Typhoon"" in it was going to be a cup of sugary water, bleh.  That and it had fruit salad on top.  Totally my fault right there.  Glass of Malbec then, please?  I received a half full glass, inquired about the full glass charge on the tally, and was told that half of their glass IS considered a full.  So therefore half of a half is ... half?  Some manky math you got there, CF. All in all, an OK experience.  Service was pretty good and food/drinks came out in a timely manner, but really nothing terribly WOW'ing here.  You're probably thinking, ""well that's what you get for expecting more from a chain restaurant!"" right?   Really unless there is a group outing or some sort of work function done here, I'd rather go somewhere else in the future.

Courtney A.,"San Francisco, CA",361,166,8,4.0,2/18/2011,"Ok, look at the nutritional info so you know what you're getting into- some of these entrees have more saturated ft than you should eat in a week (or a year...) that being said, there are a lot of healthy options if you pay attention. But most people come here for a splurge as it should be. I love the strawberry lemonade and its refills (but be aware--you've got like 300 calories per glass). Lately I've been trying out the new small plates. I highly recommend the pear and goat cheese (or maybe it's gorgonzola?) pizzette and the arugula salad. In my personal opinion, the thai and chipotle pastas are just so-so (despite sounding AMAZING in the menu). the lunh specials are a good deal, and they are still HUGE! I got the goat cheese and roasted vegetable pizza with a house salad, and it probably could have fed two people for 10 or 11 bucks. Not so bad. My biggest advice here is know what you're getting into. It's not fun to go out to a restaurant and obsess over grams of fat, but a lot of the dishes on the CF menu that you would THINK are virtuous (the lettuce wraps, for example) really pack a punch.  The service is okay, not bad, not great. But I will always love this place for its variety--everyone can find something they like. The only bad thing is that you risk spending an hour trying to decide!

""excuse me"".......""hi, do you want something??"" ............really? yes um i'd like to get 2 slices to go......*irritated stare from girl* ""sigh"".............i ordered....she rang it up, i apparently had to pay for it right then and she went back to blankly staring in front of her.....is this standard for this restaurant? why have people like this on your staff? Another couple arrived 10 mins after us (still no cheescake btw) ordered and within 2 mins they had their desserts and were gone......ok.....15 minutes later.....""excuse me how long does it take to get 2 slices?"" oh well, we're sorry but we're really busy right now and i'll need for you just wait till i can get someone to fill that order..... ok so now its 25 mins, no cheesecake and we're ready to go, i was furious i couldnt even be bothered to ask for my money back and we're running quite late for another appointment......as we're about to leave, a hostess walks up looking to change a large bill but this girl behind the counter says something and walks away.....my guy offers to change the large bill for her so she can proceed with her  night.......so no home support either.....congratulations! you have an ineffective team member and she's slowing you'r entire to-go section on a saturday night......a valentines weekend at that. 30 minutes by now and my guy just tells the young lady(if we dare call her that) to forget the order we're leaving and she bustles around irritated and gives us 2 containers with messy slices.  i said forget it!, we left the containers, took our money and just left. Im at loss to describe why that happened, what in goodness did we do to piss her off and why were we selectively picked on by this individual i will never know. Im a paying customer, i've always loved coming here, but this time was enough to ward me off.

Anthony G.,"Alexandria, VA",17,85,95,3.0,11/23/2010,"Ehh, they're okay. I mean, they have a diverse menu and are fairly consistent but I'm just not a fan.

If they tell you it's a 15 min wait, that means it's a 30 min wait.  I once ordered a salad there and it came out with no dressing.

Johnna S.,"Sacramento, CA",606,335,109,2.0,8/16/2010,"So it was 10:30pm and we hadn't eaten yet after a long, hot, typical Sacramento Saturday in July. You know how you just don't get hungry in this weather? Man, I have been suffering. Has this been the hottest summer ever, or what? I'm dyin' to leave town at any opportunity! So anyways, we use the old iPhone Yelp! app to find something open after we're done with our 5 million new-parent obligations.  Bam, Cheesecake Factory, open 'til 12:30 and 1.7 miles from our current location. Made a legal U-Turn and off we went! Let me start by saying we were more than willing to settle for anything at this point. So we weren't coming in being haters, at all. We were totally expecting mediocre, edible food and I was so thankful for their flexible hours that they started at a generous four stars. Yay. It was also baby Z's 6-month birthday. Our server looked like he'd been ""drug through a knothole backwards."" Those are the words my husband used. Isn't he precious? Who the eff says that with no time to think?  The new mother in me was concerned by this young man's condition. Even Zoey was looking at him weird. After we placed our orders, he came by the table to let us know that someone else was going to relieve him. Good, I thought, because this guy looked worked.  The new server told us that the other server had been working since noon. I mean no big deal, when I waitressed I worked a lot of double shifts. Those are also known as money-making shifts, and you usually get out of tedious side work duties when you're on over time. No restaurant  manager in her right mind is gonna make you marry ketchup bottles if you're getting time and a half for it!  Wrong. I watched as the promoted-too-soon manager-on-duty, whom looked less than 21 years old, checked his side work, and made this clearly worn out dude refill 1 salt  shaker. She did this right in front of us, and clearly got off in doing so. Instantly, I decided that I'm never coming back here. A close friend of mine created many of the items featured on the CF's extensive menus. I know what they're supposed to taste like. Which brings me to my next point, which is that the kitchen executed our order horribly. That nit-pickin manager lady needs to concern herself less with salt shakers and socializing and more with with the things people are coming here for: food and drink. But I'm sure it's much harder to throw your weight around back there, where folks are making less than 10$ an hour. The service was not great at any point during our visit. Baby Z was smiling and talking to these people and none of them acknowledged her, other than the exasperated over timer. No stars docked for this but god, how do you ignore a cute little baby that's hooting and cooing with satisfaction just to see your jaded face? Be nice!  My recommendation is this: hire/train a more competent management staff, be nice to the babies, and focus on the food.

Yves J S.,"Sacramento, CA",96,280,42,4.0,4/11/2010,"A fun place to go with a group of friends for dinner or just to enjoy some coffee and desert. Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant, bar, bakery in a large elegant building, playfully designed as if it was taken out of a dream filled with candy and sweets.     The food in the restaurant is offered in a variety of flavors from different parts of the world. Each dish boasts a certain quality and taste that is consistent regardless of what you order. The portions are usually served in large portions, leaving in the gluttons such as myself satisfied.     The bakery has an om nom nom factor of om nom nom to the nomth degree! Sweets offered by Cheesecake are the equivalent to those you would think of in a dream. Not only do you have a large array of cheesecakes and cakes to choose from, they also have cakes with cheesecakes! Most of the deserts are their own creations and most worthy of being boasted as Cheesecake originals.      The service tonight killed Roseville Cheesecake from getting 5 stars. I often frequent the Arden location and thus far have been pleased with the service. Our server seemed very lacking in customer care. She appeared to be scheduled to leave soon and decided to be lacking and left us wanting more. Our waters were left to run dry and my cappuccino arrived spilled. I didn't request another since I decided to take the cost of it away from her tip.

Sarah T.,"Sacramento, CA",98,63,13,3.0,6/16/2014,"We went here yesterday for Father's Day and had an overall pleasant experience. Our waiter was great and our food arrived in a relatively decent amount of time. We always order the avocado rolls as an appetizer. I also like the beet and goat cheese salad. We used to order the vegetarian pizza with goat cheese, but since they've removed that off their menu, I'm yet to find an entree that I LOVE. I ordered the ""Incredible Eggplant Sandwich"" and unfortunately it didn't quite live up to its name for me. After our meal, I received a survey code, after which you get a $10 eCard. I did the survey while my son wandered in the kids' area at the mall, and to my excitement, the code arrived shortly after so we headed back to the restaurant for a slice of cheesecake to go. This is when things went a little sour for me. Now I understand that they are called the CHEESECAKE factory and naturally their dessert section would be pretty busy, however, I stood at the counter and made contact with MULTIPLE employees, none of which even ACKNOWLEDGED me!! After a few minutes of waiting, I finally blurted out ""This is where I stand to make an order, right??"" after which they responded they would be right with me. I ordered ONE slice of cheesecake that was readily available in the counter and then had to wait for over TEN minutes for them to get it ready!!! What the heck! When they finally did prepare it for me, it literally took less than a minute. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR THEM TO GET IT FOR ME??? I was tempted to just go back there and get it myself! I'm a relatively patient person, but it just irked me that they would leave me standing there (with no other customers waiting at the physical counter) wait for over ten minutes for something that takes less than a minute.  In summary, meal time was great, but ordering a take out dessert was a much less than desirable experience.

Geoffrey K.,"Roseville, CA",25,68,8,3.0,1/24/2010,"This review is a bit mixed and it reflects the first time we went to this location of the restaurant. Because of the complexity of the menu, to judge it based on two items is a bit unfair and we will be going again. So take this for what it is worth. We had no waiting time and a Thursday night. The service was excellent, if a bit hyper. ;-) I started with a cup of clam chowder. Considering the size, large, I'd hate to see what a bowl was like. In any case it was very good with a reasonable amount of clam that was very tender. My wife ordered the Spinach, Mushroom, Cheese and Bacon Omelette which comes with potatoes. Sadly both the omelette and potatoes were dry. I could tell the eggs were dry just from appearance. Very disappointing. I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp which is served with Black Beans, Plantains and Cool Mango Salsa. I was very pleased with the shrimp. Unlike most restaurants I received a large number of shrimp with were cooked perfectly and with a nice amount of spiciness. The fruit salsa was very good and the plantains were well seasoned and still firm. Black beans are not a personal favorite, but these were well cooked, not mushy but still firm. The rice was on the dry side but the shrimp sauce solved that problem. For desert we split a piece of the Red Velvet Cheese Cake. First we were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the serving. The cake was light and flavorful. We were both very pleased. So over all the experience was mixed, but we certainly will be going back again and hopefully we will both be pleased with our choices.

It was 9 PM after all, so I ordered the summer rolls. My older son didn't see anything on the kids menu, so I OK'd the order of pot stickers. The bread they brought out was soooo good...either that or we were just really hungry. We ate both portions and asked for seconds. My older son didn't like the summer rolls, so I ended up eating all 3 servings. It came with two dipping sauces. The one was good, the peanut one, I didn't like. The pot stickers were excellent! Very crispy outside, but what made me and my son a fan was the soy sauce sauce it sat at. We both could have drank it. I dipped my summer rolls in it rather than the two sauces my rolls came with. It was soooo good. My toddler ate his chicken strips, and as usual, no complaints from him. His meal came with two dipping sauces as well - honey mustard and ranch. We ended the meal with a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake. My older son said the graham cracker crust was the best he ever had - and that's what he ate. The little one ate the two big dollops of whipped cream, and I ate the actual cheesecake. Very yummy. Would come back and try other things. The service was good.

Laura W.,"Sacramento, CA",48,158,8,3.0,8/14/2009,"My review is based on the two times I've been to the Roseville location. The three times at Arden were horrible, but my Roseville experience has been mixed. First experience: Went for a late lunch/early dinner. It wasn't crowded, the three of us were seated at a quiet booth and our server was excellent. I had the burrito, which is ginormous and filled with yummy chicken, cheese, rice, beans, veggies and fruit. It comes with a SMALL amount of guacamole and sour cream, but not hot sauce.  I named my first teddy bear ""Hot Sauce"" when I was 3 years old, so I need me some spice to Mexican food. They brought me their red hot sauce, warning it was *very* hot. It's medium hot, at best, but added the spice I needed. The burrito is like three meals, so it's a great deal. The ladies I were with loved their food and we shared a delicious slice of vanilla cheesecake.  I was so impressed with the service, burrito and cheesecake, I chose to go there for my birthday dinner....and I never CHOOSE to go to Roseville.  Second experience: Went for a late dinner with a party of seven. They were not crowded at all, but our food took a long time to come and almost everyone, if not everyone, was underwhelmed with service and food.  Maybe I should have known better than to order Thai food at an American chain restaurant. But the description of ""A Spicy Thai Dish with the Flavors of Curry, Peanut, Chile and Coconut. Sautéed with Vegetables and Served over Steamed White Rice"" sounded really good. For something called ""Bang - Bang Chicken and Shrimp,"" I expected it to have some BANG! to it. Especially after the waiter's warning it that it packed quite a punch. More like a pat on the back. It was bland to the blanditty bland. I asked the waiter if it could be spiced up, he suggested more sauce, which didn't seem like it would help considering how bland the sauce was, but I said ok. It didn't help. I love Thai food and this was terrible. I also love carrot cake and cheesecake, but their carrot cheesecake is just ok.

Marina P.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,7,4,5.0,12/11/2011,"Wow, skinnylicious indeed!!  My hubby and I are regular patrons of Cheesecake Factory in multiple cities.  The dishes we keep ordering again and again include the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, cajun jambalaya pasta, miso salmon, chicken salad sandwich and most of their soups.  We have never considered the soft tacos because we thought they wouldn't compare to the ones at authentic Mexican restaurants.  Okay, my hubby had tried their enchiladas before (but that's because he loves enchiladas and would try enchiladas at pretty much anywhere).  Today we were given the skinnylicious menu in addition to the regular menu and I was going to order the skinnylicious chicken salad sandwich when suddenly hubby wanted to try the soft tacos.  I looked at him in shock ""don't you normally like crispy tacos? I am the one who likes soft tacos!!"".  Our server then proceeded to tell us the skinnylicious soft tacos is one of her top three favorite dishes at Cheesecake Factory and that she absolutely loves it.  We both decided to get it and we were worried how we would like a dish we both hadn't tried before.  The tacos (three soft corn tortillas filled with spicy chicken or shrimp, avocado, tomato, onions, cilantro and crema, served with spanish rice) came and they looked good.  Little did we know how much we were going to LOVE them!  We both inhaled them as fast as we could because they were just divine!!  They were not greasy or heavy and the sauce on the side gave the tacos a nice ""kick"".  Even after three tacos for each of us, we didn't feel the heavy, heartburn-about-to-happen feeling.  We felt like we could inhale a fourth one and were glad they ""only"" came with three.  I was always suspicious of the ""under-so-many-calories light menu"" because I would rather take the calories and be fat than have bland hard-to-get-down food.  I seriously don't know how these three tacos and the side rice dish can amount to under 590 calories.  I am so over the moon with this soft tacos dish that I want to have it again tomorrow for lunch (that would involve going to the restaurant again because, of course, we didn't have any leftovers!).  Thank you, Cheesecake Factory, for the heavenly skinnylicious soft tacos.  I also saw so many other items I want to try from the skinnylicious menu.  Wow, unbelievable, I am speechless ;-) Super yummy delicious food on the skinny menu!!

I really can't even begin to explain how much I love it, I could probably eat it daily and still love it! The portions are large, but that could be due to the fact that they serve you endless bread that's so yummy to where I'm not even hungry when my food comes! This Cheesecake Factory is smaller than others, but the service is much better! Every server and hostess I've talked to there are very nice. Last time I was there my friend's dish had a hair in it, and the manager himself came out to explain how sorry he was and he seemed very genuine about it.  I only have 2 issues with the place: 1. It's always very busy, which is fine. But expect to wait a little longer than they tell you. If the hostess says 30 minutes, expect 45 minutes, at minimum. 2. Last time I went they have the calorie counts directly posted, practically ON the cheesecake! I understand that this is the law now, but seriously, to see that one piece of cheesecake that I would love to demolish has enough calories to feed one for an entire day is a slight turn-off, and surprisingly, it made me not want to take any cheesecake to go!

Sometimes I have good experiences, and other times bad. They put a whole heck of a lot of cilantro on a lot of the dishes, to the point where that's all you can taste. I usually love avocado egg rolls, but these taste like they just got out of the microwave. I do like the chicken and biscuits here and the California cheesesteak.  They have one drink here that is just fricken amazing. The Georgia peach is one of the best drinks of anywhere. Tastes like biting into a juicy ripe peach. I'm also not the biggest fan of cheesecake, but I do like their original cheesecake. However, it's extremely overpriced. Like $20 for a small cheesecake.

The bread that is brought out prepares you for the beginning of a great meal. Each of the chicken plates I've had so far are delicious. I have to point out that the plate portions are large! Two people can easily share a plate.  If you want to establish a standard for making homemade cheesecake, find your taste here at CF and take it from there. I've had the Red Velvet, Key-Lime, and the list goes on and on. The cheesecake is phenomenal and when my wife makes homemade cheesecake we wonder who CF can do what they do.

I ordered the Combo - Steak Diane with Herb Crusted Salmon.  It was just what I wanted and it was really delish.  Underneath the salmon was some very fresh and perfectly cooked asparagus with a lemony sauce - it paired perfectly with the salmon. I was really happy with the mushrooms that came with the steak and the sauce was very yummy! For dessert I ordered their Lemon Meringue cheesecake - it's new and it was really good.  Had great lemony (tart) flavor to accent the creamy sweetness of the cheesecake. Best thing about it?

Claudia P.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/29/2017,"Firstly, I'd just like to say that this review only received 2 stars because our waitress, Nicole, was so polite and courteous to us during our horrible visit that she deserved the recognition and extra star. But the restaurant itself deserves zero stars, but it received one since that's not a possibility.  We arrived at 4:50 on a Saturday night, expecting some sort of wait since it was a Saturday and Saturdays are typically busy nights and the Cheesecake Factory is always busy. We were told 40 minutes and we're seated by 5:30, so no issues there. We were then told that new menu additions had been added tonight to test out and were shown a new, additional menu with around 10 new items. We thought nothing of it at the time but you'll soon learn why this was an issue. We had placed our order at around 5:45 and by the time 6:40 had rolled around we still had not received our meals and the manager came over to tell us the kitchen had backed up and our meals would be out in a minute. 15 minutes later our meals finally arrived,  about on hour after we had ordered them.  Mine as well as my Dad's arrived cold and my mom's arrived wrong as well as burnt. The manager offered to fix my mom's meal but she simply made do because she didn't want to wait another hour. The waitress (a different one as Nicole had gone on break) offered to take mine back and get a new plate but by the time she came around I was already halfway done and didn't want to wait any longer. Thankfully, the comped my meal and gave us free cheesecake which was generous and we were thankful for that. But the experience didn't end there.  After we had finished eating we spent another 30-45 minutes simply just waiting to check out. This was due to the fact the the Break waitress had run the wrong table and had to go through and cancel everything to redo it. Nicole was very straight up with us when she came backs as well as apologetic for what had happened, even stating how bad she felt and we appreciated the honesty but truthfully we were anxious to get out as our dinner experience had already lasted 2 hours.  Word to the wise Cheesecake Factory: Don't test 10 additional menu items on the busiest night of the week. The kitchen can't handle it, it stresses out and causes a multitude of problems for managers and waiters/waitresses and makes really unhappy customers. I know for a fact that we were not the only table that the manager had to come to for a problem, so I'm sure that my family as well as others had a very long and unhappy Saturday night dinner all thanks to the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=120

I have only been to this location once about 5 years ago.  Its just a not a place I think about going.  I had been with friends but my husband had not so we agreed to go.  It is a little smaller than the one on Arden.  We walk in for late lunch around 230 on Wednesday.  Little did know it was cheesecake day and all slices were half off as I saw on the flyer at the counter.  Not ONE employee ever told me about it.   We had walked in with another group and the hostess was a little confused who to help so I politely tell her that they were first so she takes them to her seat and we view the dessert case trying to make our cheesecake selection in the meantime.  I turn around and she is helping/seating the new people who just walked in.  Hello???  Our server came and got our initial drink and food order in a good amount of time but went down hill from there.  I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken as I remembered really liking it.  Husband got avocado rolls which for a meal left me unsatisfied but was actually tasty.  My dish was not as good as a I remembered.  Noodles were a little too al dente and not as flavorful?   Waitress was inattentive. Checked on us once about 3 minutes after our food delivered and I had not taken a bite yet. Then nothing.  Our drinks were bone dry and we were about to get up and get refills ourselves at the drink station that was so teasingly close to our table when she finally came.  I told her we both made sure to leave room for dessert!  so she asked if we'd like a dessert menu.  Yes please!  Their desserts are very expensive.  EVERYTHING is $7 minimum.  They wanted $6.95 for a bowl of fresh strawberries.  Are you kidding me??? and $7.95 for a hot fudge sundae.  A cheese cake slice is $7-8 in which I can accept but still so pricey if you figure on a table of 6 would add another $42 to the bill.  Thank goodness for being half off day.  We decided what we wanted and waited.  And waited.  And waited 10+ minutes before she came by to take our dessert order.  The wait was so long that it didn't sound good anymore and the wait was not worth it as we had things to do.   As for the survey for your $10 egift card.  Be wary.  It asks for your name/address/phone/email and not a whole lot about your visit.  Two questions exactly.  Seems like a phishing expedition on their part even though there is a whole one page disclaimer but I think that is why they do it. I have never seen such a long in depth disclaimer in my life for a survey!  Overall I was very disappointed in this visit.  Service was terrible.  Food was not outstanding.  I couldn't even try their infamous cheesecake.  Looks like another 5 years before I return to this location.  There are just too many good places to eat in Roseville now to want to come back.  Plus I am not a huge cheesecake fan.  I like it but don't love it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=120
Charles C.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,6,,2.0,7/11/2017,"It's been awhile since we've been back here, and technically we didn't even stay to get in.  Basically we were informed that it was a 15 minute wait to be seated.  However during that same time period at lease 5 plus groups went in, at least 3 after we asked to be seated.  This was because they were 3 people or less.  If the restaurant wasn't half empty wouldn't even mention it, but since it was largely empty it didn't quite make sense that they could accommodate the same or more number of people, but only in smaller groups.  We were seating 5 people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=120

Vanessa S.,"Fair Oaks, CA",29,9,,5.0,6/2/2011,"My boyfriend and I went here for our date night. We haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory for about 5 years and my boyfriend wasn't thrilled about going here again. I had to basically twist his arm to get him to go eat here. We got there and the host said there would be a 5 -10 min wait. In about 2 minutes, our name was called and we were seated. Our waitress came over and took our drink order and brought us some bread and butter. I liked the sourdough and my boyfriend liked the other dark kind..don't know the name of it. It was nice to have a choice of bread though. After we finished that basket, our waitress brought us another one right away, refilled our drinks and took our order. My strawberry lemonade I ordered was one of the best ever, and I only ever order strawberry lemonade at restaurants, so I know a good one when I taste one. Our food came out very quickly and looked delicious! I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken and my boyfriend ordered the smokehouse bbq burger. I LOVED my pasta! It was filled with gooey cheesy deliciousness! Next time I will order it without the chicken, it didn't add anything to the pasta, except $2. My boyfriend also LOVED his burger. He said it was the best restaurant burger he ever had, which for him is very high praise! The fries weren't anything to write home about, but he said his burger more than made up for it. After stuffing our faces, and still having leftovers for tomorrow, we decided there was enough room in our bellies for a piece of cheesecake. We ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake. Two words come to mind...DEAR GOD! It was so rich, smooth and creamy. Then I ordered the Snickers Bar Cheesecake to go, as a surprise for my boyfriend to take home. Boy was he excited for that too! On our way home, I asked my boyfriend if he was happy we went there and if i was right to pick The Cheesecake Factory for our date night. He told me that I was right and that he was glad we tried it again! It's now on our favorite restaurant list!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=540

Randolph A.,"Elk Grove, CA",21,57,19,4.0,1/12/2009,"So I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory ever since my first time eating at the one on top of Macy's Union Square in San Francisco. This place didn't have the same views but the food and of course the cheesecake made up for it... can't complain. My girl and I ate here Friday night with some friends and had pretty good tasting food along with great service.  Just like any Cheesecake Factory... no matter where or what time of day, I swear there is always a wait... for us, it wasn't too bad... 15 minutes or so and we were seated. Our server, Mike, was prompt and friendly. He was also very helpful pointing out specials of the day and even some items not in the menu. But all of us kinda knew what we already wanted so we didn't get anything he suggested... maybe next time. Me and my girl ended up getting the Clam Chowder for an appetizer and the Crispy Chicken Costoletta for the main course.  The wait for the food wasn't too bad... I think it was because I was stuffing myself with the damn fresh complementary breads... not sure... but anyways the food came pretty quick. When we got our chicken, it looked hella good. It looked like it was breaded just right and it didn't look too oily either. When I took a bite, it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside... it was pretty good. The only thing though was the lemon juice was a little too damn overpowering. Whatever sauce they mixed with the lemon juice, I think I tasted more lemon than the chicken itself. So I didn't use much of the sauce but still enjoyed the chicken. The asparagus was to really fresh. It was crunchy as hell and it was full of flavor... and it wasn't from the lemon juice. The mashed potatoes were pretty good too. As for the clam chowder... it was descent... I think I'm spoiled from Boudin's Clam Chowder in San Francisco... I haven't found anything better than that yet.  Overall our server was on point the whole night, filling up the waters for everyone and checking on us once in awhile to see if we were doing okay. So far, I've always been happy with Cheesecake Factory's service... and I've mostly been very happy with their cheesecake! After eating that big dinner, I didn't have room for cheesecake so I brought it home. My favorites are the Tiramisu and the Pistachio Chocolate Swirl.

Kevin L.,"San Jose, CA",5,46,,1.0,3/22/2013,"Absolutely the WORST service I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Lazy, rude and not service oriented. We were seated for 10 minutes before our server came and recognized our table telling us that he would be right back, 5 minutes later he returned to grab our drink order. 5 minutes later he returned with half of our drinks and bread which tipped over on his wet tray and then put on the table. When I told him that we would not accept the bread off of his tray he put up an argument informing me that the trays are sanitized after each use - I worked in food for 6 years, doesn't matter if your tray came right out of dishwasher - food should never touch it, he finally took the bread back. My brother ordered a sweetened green tea, it took 10 minutes longer for this drink to come out - I was able to have my water refilled by the time my brother got his ice tea, and my refill wasn't done by our server. So 30 minutes in we now have drinks, and our server continues to not be around, we manage to get him over to grab our dinner order and at the end he finally introduces himself as Micheal and takes off to the kitchen. During the 45 minutes our food was cooking Michael refilled a few of our drinks and got my brother another ice tea within 2 minutes of requesting it, why'd it take so long the first time??? Finally food came out - my brother gets shorted again- wrong order, my mother- missing sides. A manager, Mike, comes over and attempts to figure out what was wrong with the order, it is then that we informed Mike of the horrible service we had received, Michael overheard this and attempted to interject quickly being cut off by his manager and my brother. Manager Mike tried very hard to fix things, it wasn't happening though, by this point we were so frustrated with the lack of service we had received there was nothing he could do to make our dinner better.

It represents All That Is Wrong with suburban restaurants and, even more, the people frequenting them. Yet it isn't Windows Vista-bad (though highly bloated). The foulness is more subversive than at surface. The food is decent enough, the staff quite friendly, and it seems to cater well to the target audience. The problem, though, is that this kind of ""good enough"" becomes so popular that it steals a slice of banana-cream cheesecake from the independents pushing for something better.

Michelle B.,"Fair Oaks, CA",117,197,58,5.0,1/27/2014,"I started coming to this Cheesecake Factory location a few weeks ago. I've been here several times now and every time the service is absolutely wonderful, especially Heidi, and the serving sizes are plentiful. Plus, I feel the entrees are fairly priced. Depending on the mood I am in, going healthy or cheating on the diet, there's something for just about everyone. 1st visit I had the Beets & Goat Cheese Salad, it was surprisingly plentiful and filling. If you're also getting an entree, I recommend sharing the salad. I recommend asking for extra apples.  However! When I mentioned it to the server that they should up the apple quantity in the salad, she actually called the manager over, so I could share my comments with the manager (made my opinion feel really valued). I spoke with Ron, wonderful guy, and he absolutely agreed. In fact, Ron said he asks for extra apples on his own salads too. So, it is possible that they may, in fact, have already started serving it with additional apples!!! 2nd visit, I ordered the Buffalo Hamburger, but I ordered it protein style (with a lettuce wrap). When it came out, it barely had any buffalo hot sauce or blue cheese crumbles. I let the server know and she said originally the kitchen had goofed and they made it on a regular bun, hence my condiments were probably stuck to the bun. She quickly sent out a hearty bowl of extra buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbles and the manager Ron delivered them. Again the manager was genuinely interested in my feedback and getting to the bottom of the issue regarding the lacking condiments. The burger was perfectly cooked, how I requested (medium-rare), and very good!  3rd visit, we had a big group and we were looking for appetizers and dessert. We ordered the Chicken Nachos which were HUGE. We had 4 kids and 2 adults and there were still some nachos left over. We also ordered the calamari, it was very good. Not the best I've ever had, but good. As well as we ordered the deep dried Macaroni Balls, these were a great hit with the kids. For dessert, we split 3 cheesecakes among 6 people. Smores', Dulce (caramel), and New York Plain Cheesecake. They were all equally wonderful, but how can you go wrong with cheesecake?!? Beverages: their hot chocolate is incredible! One of the best blends I've ever had. I will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=300

tina p.,"San Ramon, CA",225,223,28,4.0,3/22/2015,"Came here for a business dinner in late January. Hadn't eaten at a cheesecake factory in probably close to a decade. The avocado eggrolls were just as delicious as I remembered. Had the Salmon Genovese, asked for broccoli instead of green beans. It was delicious! Paired nicely with the Kim Crawford sav blanc. Service was good, and wait wasn't too long (though it was a Wednesday night around 8pm).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=300

Rachel B.,"Rocklin, CA",1,32,5,1.0,10/29/2014,"Went to the location in San Francisco and had bad service so I should have known not to come here. The restaurant it's self is clean and nice on the inside but you can barely see. Kinda like the inside of Abercrombie and Fitch or hollister no lighting. The wait was not long on a Tuesday evening. We got sat in about 5 minutes. Sadly our server seemed very rush and in a hurry and didn't know a lot about the alcoholic drinks/menu. The whole time we felt like she had no time to give to us if we needed something or to take our orders. We first ordered a salad which came out incorrectly. Then our actual meals came out which seemed like really small portions for what your paying for. Not worth the money at all. My steak and potatoes were cold, my moms pasts was pretty mediocre and my sisters pasta was super greasy. I am not a complainer but I expect a good meal coming to a restaurant I can live with bad service but please make the food good! Finally we ordered dessert which was cheese cake. Honestly I can say that was ok. The portions are pretty big and the presentation looks nice. So they did one thing alright.  I must say cheese cake factory needs to work on there customer service and Learn how many tables to give a server so you actually get good service. For what your paying for drinks, a meal and desert which comes out to be around $150 for four people, they really need to have better service. In the San Francisco location same thing, service was very bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=300
Katherine G.,"Elk Grove, CA",19,71,310,5.0,8/28/2013,Excellent service and the food was on point.

Sandra And Barry G.,"Rocklin, CA",46,6,1,2.0,12/23/2015,"Ate here for dinner with my husband, we both ordered pasta, before we even made it out the restaurant we both were sick to our stomachs - food poisoning.

Cindy K.,"Folsom, CA",208,1066,517,4.0,8/1/2011,"Last Sunday was the National Cheesecake day. Did you go get your half-off cheesecake??? Well I did and it was awesome. We went here for some lunch after shopping and D&B.  I admit, even though this place is amazing sometimes I don't want to come because I'm worried about what kind of service I'll get. It's a hit or miss. Actually this time it was sort of a miss. Our waitress took forever to come back and take our order. She was borderline rude/indifferent towards us. We asked her several times for break. It just felt like a horrible waiting game with her. Luckily her shift ended after we got our meal and we got a new and better waitress.  The bf tried the Renee sandwich combo. YUM! He even got their sweet potato fries. The soup that came with it was delicious. Tasted like chicken pot pie without the pie. I think there was too much mayo in the chicken salad and could've use more almonds. I got my usual, pasta da vinci.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=300

David S.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,16,1,1.0,9/7/2014,"I don't really even want to leave this review, because they will probably figure out who left it and spit in my food next time I'm there, but I just have to. My GF and I go to this place 3-4 times a month.  We really like it. However, it just needs to be said that Natalie is the absolute WORST waitress I think I have ever had.  I mean EVER. She totally ruined this place for us. So I order a cocktail and some bread to start.   After I drink it and we eat the bread, she comes back and asks if we want any appetizers.  I order another cocktail and a soda, my GF orders a beer and we ask for more bread.  She comes back later with my drink and a glass of water(?) ok, fine.  She said she's going to give us another minute to look at the menu.  She comes back with her beer and we order.  Now she has her hands just full of crap, so she doesn't write anything down of course.  She leaves (still no bread or soda).  We never see her again until after our food comes out (NOT like we ordered it, of course!).  She doesn't even bother to check on us, I had to wave her down and she literally rolled her eyes.  We couldn't believe it, right in front of us, gave us the craziest look ever for bothering her I guess.  Whatever.        So we're almost done eating and STILL no soda (or bread, but that doesn't even matter anymore).  Finally, she remembers and brings it out.  I'm pretty much done at this point with my meal.  Ok, no big deal.  Not like she's going t charge us for a soda that took an hour that was delivered when I had maybe 3 bites of food left, right? WRONG.  $2.95  right on the bill.  Whatever, I just want to leave.  Now. back to that bill.  This lady had the audacity to draw faces and crap all over the bill and even had the time to put hearts all around the SUGGESTED TIP part.  Oh hell no! Not for this crappy service!  No wonder she forgot the drinks, she was too busy trying to subconsciously pad her tips on people's bills.  It was so blatant, we had to post it on facebook to see if we were overreacting.  We weren't .  I used to work for tips, for a long time, actually.  I usually tip 20% even for bad service, just because.  I typically do 25-30% and that's why the bartenders know me everywhere, but I just couldn't this time.  I wanted to stiff her SO BAD, but couldn't.  I still left her 10 percent for some dumb reason,  which, I think I've now only done twice--EVER and I just pray I NEVER get her section again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-roseville?start=300
