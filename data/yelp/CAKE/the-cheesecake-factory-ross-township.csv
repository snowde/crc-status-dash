Eric T.,"McKnight, PA",0,3,,4.0,10/26/2017,"Generally do a great job but I've got a rant.  You changed the eggplant parm dish.  The new dish is awful.  Please go back to your old preparation.  I'm guessing the new one comes straight from a freezer to the microwave to your table which is the reason for the change.  The previous dish was beautifully prepared.  I liked it so much I had most of my family ordering it as well.   Lastly, I've enjoyed some very nice meals at the bar.  Can't recall the gal's name but she is a gem and I've gone back just because of her.   I'm going to give 4 stars as I think you do a good job but you have to fix that eggplant dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township
Tim W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2562,527,597,2.0,8/20/2017,"I have been coming to The Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years and I left truly disappointed.  My wife and I had a rare Saturday night to ourselves so I decided to take her out to eat after putting up with me at the Nordstrom Anniversary sale. Once we arrived there was a 25 to 30 minute wait which I didn't mind. Once our pager went off we almost literally broke our necks walking to our table as the floor was so slippery.  Once seated our waitress Meghan came and took our drink orders. We hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while so it was nice to see some new items on the menu. When we finally decided what we wanted I chose the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage and my wife chose the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. A few minutes later Meghan came back with our bread. 10 to 15 minutes later Meghan came back and said that our food would be coming soon. By this time a few other groups had been seated and placed their orders as well. Another twenty five minutes later we still have no food. All of the other tables around us had gotten their drinks, appetizers and entrees and we still had nothing! Finally we got our food almost 45 minutes after being seated. We did not order appetizers just entrees so we had bread and water until our food finally came. By this time I was really feeling some type of way! At least our food as good! After I got our check and paid I was going to just let it go but I couldn't so I asked to speak to the manager. Once she came over I let her know what happened. I let her know they we had been come to the Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years and never once had to wait that long for food. She apologized and offered us a piece of cheesecake. I usually enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but after this experience, I don't know when or if I will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township
Kelly V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",97,40,144,4.0,1/7/2018,"While it was super busy, Kelsey and I walked in and were seated right away. We started with the bread and butter (we both love the brown bread) followed by the Mac & Cheese appetizer. It's huge! It comes with four pieces total. Very good! I had the Farfalle chicken pasta with garlic. I've had this dish before and today it was just okay. Overall we have a great lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township
Erica S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",51,78,62,4.0,1/10/2018,This visit I ordered the veggie burger and the side salad. The veggie burger has a really good taste to it. It's made out of black beans and rice and It comes with lettuce tomato onion and pickles on it. I added mushrooms because I put them on everything as well it came with a piece of cheese. The only thing about the burger is that it breaks apart easily. The salad is really fresh and comes with pieces of tomato and I believe little peppers. The balsamic that they toss it with is very VERY light. Just tasted like wet lettuce. I still have them a 4 Star because they normally have excellent food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township
Gwen K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,20,13,5.0,1/1/2018,Even tho the price is high but it worth every penny. Sometimes I just go there to buy cake. The only downside is the wait. Line is always long. Not just here and every Cheesecake Fac.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township
Kelsey V.,"Hollsopple, PA",111,10,30,4.0,1/7/2018,A Vann sister favorite! The Cheesecake Factory always is a big hit with us. Today I got the Louisiana Chicken pasta and split the Fried Mac & Cheese Balls with my sister. The pasta has a nice kick to it and breading on the chicken is light and crunchy. The only downside today was I found a dark long hair in my pasta. The Mac & Cheese was fantastic as always though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township
Roya G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",128,7,11,4.0,1/5/2018,"Ahhh the cheesecake factory. An absolute nightmare for indecisive people like myself. 3 menus (regular, special, and skinnylicious) for me to debate over until I just about give up and order something spontaneous because the waitress has visited my table 3 times now asking if I ""still need more time"". And that begins our tale. My fellow yelper Madilyn and I headed into the Cheesecake factory tonight with an open mind... Yet I felt my choices were still made poorly. ANYWAYS, I got chicken samosas as my starter - it was actually delicious. Super hot and crispy, well spiced, and the cilantro sauce was an excellent pairing. Reminded me of a good Indian restaurant. Okay so the entree is where I feel I made the wrong decision. I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta, which was listed as being ""very spicy"". First off... not spicy at all. So that was disappointing. Also the pasta was definitely overcooked, WAY past al dente and starting to all stick together.. almost mushy. I think there were 4 pieces of small shrimp. It still had an OK flavor - just not what I was expecting for $19. Ended up taking most of it home. OH- I also got a moscow mule and an asian pear martini. The moscow mule didn't even come in a copper mug... I wish I took a picture to show how sad it looked but it wasn't even worthy of one. But I gotta say the pear martini was amazing. I'm still giving 4 stars because of the following reasons - friendly, attentive staff - nice atmosphere - extensive menu - great bread/butter to start - it was actually WARM inside compared to other restaurants i've been to lately. Always a pleasant experience, as I've been here many times before. Will surely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township
Fox E.,"Buffalo, NY",3671,4883,17405,4.0,3/7/2017,"If it were the Cheapskate Factory then everyone that comes here would be using coupons, groupons, and trying to get stuff for free. Oh wait, that's basically what happens. I'm no fan of corporate chains, and I don't even think TCF's Cheesecake is very good. Their prices are extraordinarily high, their burgers are average, and their shakes are, well, excellent. However, this particular location is something special. It's probably my fave in the country. Not just for the shakes, but also, the employees at this place are incredibly helpful and nice.

Please reconsider having to ""dine in"" for this offer. It sucks to have to wait so long when you know 75% of the people waiting only came for dessert I'm personally working on trying every flavor they sell!  Went for the banana this time.

Eva R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",291,254,620,3.0,7/20/2017,"Cheesecake factory is always the place to go to when craving some cheesecake. Their menu is extensive and portions are huge. Since it was lunch time, I went with something lighter. I had the Mexican chicken salad. I guess I should not have been surprised that the salad portion was still huge. It had a fried tortilla on the bottom, lots of greens, tomatoes, grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and dressing. I wish there had been more chicken. My friend had the Tuscan chicken dish off the skinnylicious menu and still could not finish her portion. We then of course had to have cheesecake. My favorite is the mango key lime cheesecake, which has a nice coconut crust,key lime cheesecake, mango mousse, and mango glaze. It is creamy, but also very refreshing!

Kimberly B.,"Findlay, OH",26,6,2,1.0,1/13/2018,"My first time at a Cheesecake Factory and I was severely disappointed. The wait was about an hour, which I was ok with especially after hearing so many rave reviews of the food and cheesecake. While waiting I couldn't help but be distracted by one of the front desk girls who was constantly on her cell phone while patrons were trying to get her attention. Once we were seated, our waiter was nice enough. I ended up ordering their fish and chips and my husband ordered their club sandwich. When the food came I have 5 smallish pieces of fish and fries (I got a salad instead of the coke slaw). At first, I thought the portion size was a bit small for being over $17 for the meal but I figured it must be good. My fish was over cooked and unseasoned. It was chewy!  My husbands club sandwich was ok although the bread was over toasted as well. When I asked for extra ketchup our waiter gave me a nasty look and walked away. I assumed he hadn't heard me and must have gave a weird look for another reason. He did come back with the ketchup. We got cheesecake to go and I haven't had it yet but I sure hope it is awesome!  I will not go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township

Veronica B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",259,80,117,4.0,2/14/2017,"Pretty decent! I decided to stop in after work and I ordered the Steak Diane. It was definitely grilled to perfection and so tender, but my only hesitation is that it didn't have the exact quality I was looking for. It tasted a bit commercial, and I know it's a commercial chain. However, because of the price, I just still feel it should be a bit more quality in authentic taste.  The other issue is that I ordered it go, and it was almost ice cold when I got home. I don't live far and I didn't make any stops. Because of the temp, I am sure it would have seemed a bit cold to me even if I ate there.  I am not totally counting it, and will go again.

Robert U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",130,696,131,4.0,12/14/2016,"It delivers. Yes, it's part of a big chain, but I don't care.  This place is solid, it's consistent, and it delivers, over and over. Their menu is vast.  I don't like that they don't seem to have a specialty, but they seem to get away with it.  A burrito or taco?  Excellent.  Some Italian food?  They nail it.  A burger and fries?  Solid. And, of course, their huge variety of cheesecakes is part of the fun.  But here's a surprise - their coffee is really quite good (I'm hardcore, and most big restaurants serve crappy coffee). Service, as expected, is consistently very good and efficient.  It's a big huge place, but they make it work.  Expect a colossal wait.  Put your name in and go browse the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township
Andrea S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",46,75,117,3.0,6/18/2017,"Only giving 3 stars because the waitress was so nice & my mojito was good. I don't come here often but when I do, I usually order the Cajun chicken pasta which has a thick spicy cream sauce, veggies & is topped with tortilla strips that add really nice texture to the dish. (I order it without chicken). The waitress brought it to the table & asked me to stir it & make sure there was no chicken, which I thought was really considerate because a lot of times people forget to not add meat to dishes. It looked fine (We sat outside & it was dark) but after she left I began to eat & the sauce was so thin & there was barely any of it in the pasta, so it was pretty flavorless. I was really disappointed in the execution. It's always been really consistent in the past. I'm sure I'll be back again & will order that dish again, but I'll make sure to ask them to ensure the sauce is creamy, as it should be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township

Aaron Z.,"Wexford, PA",133,190,34,3.0,10/6/2016,"I went here on a Friday night with my wife and another couple.  I was expecting there to be a huge wait, but we were pleasantly surprised that it only took us 20 minutes to get a table.  The inside is impressively decorated and the lighting is a bit darker inside.  The menu is a bit overwhelming here.  Too many things to choose from, but in the same breath you can come back frequently and never get the same thing.  Everything on the menu sounded appetizing, and my wife and I settled on two different types of pasta.  Mine was supposed to be a spicier pasta, but it really didn't have much kick to it.  My wife liked hers which had peas, bacon, and Alfredo sauce. It wasn't anything spectacular but they do give you a healthy portion.  The bread that came with the meal was fairly good.  The couple we came split fried chicken and mashed potatoes as well as a salad.  I was a little more envious of their meal than mine.  For dessert, we had the Tuxedo cheesecake in a to go box which for sure exceeded my expectations.   Overall, this is a very expensive place to go eat at.  Our meal was around $60 for 2 dinners and a dessert.  I'm not opposed to come back, but if I'm going to spend $60 for dinner I will go somewhere nicer.  I think the menu does have items that are reasonable and that I would look to get if I end up going here again.  The cheesecake is for sure excellent, so I wouldn't hesitate to stop in to pick up dessert sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township
Michael Y.,"Alexandria, VA",385,113,205,4.0,5/19/2017,"The world famous Cheesecake Factory. Not much different from the others, which is fine by me since I'm a fan of the place. The food here is what I would call ""splurge"" food---it's really unhealthy and oily---but, if you're at the Cheesecake Factory, that's probably what you're going for anyway. As much as I love eating their super flavored, greasy food, sometimes it's just overpowering and makes me feel a sense of ""ugh"" inside. For example, I got their Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp, and as much as I love eating flavorful things, I thought that the meal was just really heavy for me at the end. Also, the crabcake appetizer I had was really heavy and I didn't know if I even wanted to eat my main entree. Other than the huge dump of calories in my body, I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. The decor is Disneyworld-like and really gets you in the mood to have fun.

Well we should have. It took one hour to get any food. The bread she said she would bring, we had to ask her for 30minutes later as we were starving. Our appetizer came but the main course which were salads took another 20minutes. By that time we were full on apps and bread and had to package them to go.

It would be nice to have more space. They definitely need to make room for the volume of costumers they get.  But anyway, I ordered a Veggie Melt sandwich. It doesn't sound exciting but it was de-licious! I didn't even miss meat while I was stuffing my face, which I think is a sign of a good veggie dish.

Arlene M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",356,771,3128,3.0,7/21/2014,My city has two Cheesecake factory restaurants. I have eaten at both and they are identical. My first recommendation is to get there when it opens otherwise you will be waiting quite some time for a seat. Normally when I eat there I go for lunch since they serve huge portions. I normally order a lunch salad and it is so huge I really can't eat much more of anything else. They do serve two kinds of bread with your meal. My favorite is the brown bread with white seeds on top. They do have various cheesecakes in a cooler case when you enter so you can see the various types. You can also purchase them for takeout. They are very filling but the are NY style. Believe me it isn't authentic but the next best thing to it. I usually end up taking food home since they serve large portions.

A little too sticky and there were odd bits of lettuce in the cheese (when the sandwich does not contain lettuce). Wasn't a fan. The fries were OK, but considering I paid $15 for my lunch, I expected something a little better.

Julie D.,"Wilmington, NC",380,1200,1382,4.0,8/30/2014,"It's taken me forever and a few years to write a review for The Cheesecake Factory at Ross Park Mall.  I guess it's because I don't really understand the love and the appeal.  This place is almost always packed!!  I also don't really understand how they can have such a large menu that covers almost every type of food there is and get everything right.  And that's because they don't.  Even so, the masses flock to this place like bees to a hive. It should be the ultimate place to dine while at the mall!  Beautiful interior, soaring ceilings, custom painted fancy columns, dark wood booths.  Service is friendly and generally spot on.   Back to the menu (complete with advertisements, am I the only one that finds this so tacky?), you can get pizza, pasta,(including jambalaya style) seafood, steaks and chops, salads, sandwiches, burgers, omelets and Sunday Brunch.  For beverages, they serve wine, beer, cocktails, frozen drinks, espresso, milkshakes.  Again, you want it, they got it.   Quantities can sometimes be too large.  I got a salad here one time that was so big it was almost embarrassing.  I could not longer see my date over my salad.  It was more greens that I could eat in one week.  Oh, and the cheesecake.  The choices here are also over the top and decedent.  But really, who has room left for dessert?  Of course, they are more than happy to bag it up for you to take out. A recent addition that is making me like them more is The SkinnyLicious Menu.  Again, an overkill with all the choices.  And you will never get skinny eating these meals, but it is a vast improvement over their regular fare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=40

Stephanie P.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,5,,1.0,3/24/2017,"Hi,  I felt I had to share my experience with you since I will never eat at your establishment again during to the poor management staff you have at your ross park mall location. On Monday afternoon my lunch guest and I ordered Renee's special. Nothing too complicated, right? We waited thirty five minutes for our meal and this entire time we never saw our waiter. He never filled our ice teas   or water or checked on us to pretend he even cared. To really top this lunch trip off when we finally got our meal, our French onion soup was ice cold. Again, we didn't see our waiter until we were almost done with our meal, sans the soup. We told him our disappointment with the soup and wait time and he sent over a manager. The manager told us that HE forgot to turn the soup warmer on and offered to warm up our soup. THAT'S IT! After waiting for thirty five minutes you want me to wait while you warm up my soap?

Stephen B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,8,,2.0,12/13/2016,"This is a 2 star only because my wife's meal was edible and the manager took care of my meal issues.  We went to lunch expecting a nice meal.  We have been to this location at least 30 times over the years and have had good meals.  Today not the case.  Start with the edible meal.  My wife ordered chicken tortilla soup and turkey sandwich with small salad.   The bowl of CHICKEN tortilla soup had 2, maybe 3 pieces of actual chicken in it.  Hardly any tortilla in the soup, but it had flavor and was spicy.  We were given white sourdough bread, but expected the good dark sweet bread that we have received every other time here.  For some reason we didn't get the bread we liked but the tables next to us got it?   Her sandwich was okay, nothing to brag about.  I ordered a dinner portion Cobb salad.  I have ordered this before and really enjoyed it.  This time it came out looking sad.  I noticed a literal ball shape of chicken on the right side of the salad.  Upon inspecting it and peeling apart the chicken layers, it was nasty.  It showed many signs of being undercooked, was a bit slippery, and was fatty.  It was also stone cold.  It looked like someone reached into an old tray of chicken and grabbed a ball of old chicken and set it on my salad.  The kitchen staff obviously did not inspect the chicken.  The rest of the salad was not too good.  Hardly any egg around the edge like I normally get.  Barely any dressing in the salad and not much bacon.  It was basically chopped lettuce.   I showed the waitress the chicken and her face showed it all.  She showed the manager and he came over and apologized and agreed that the chicken looked bad.  He did not charge me for the salad.  I was offered replacement food as well but did not feel like eating anything else there at the time.   The salad was $15.  I hope they have not changed their salads since the last time I had a good one there.   It definitely was not worth $15 even with a good piece of chicken.   Overall, a nice day off with my wife and the lunch was a huge disappointment.  I probably won't go back to this restaurant for a while.  The staff were nice and I left a 15% tip based on the full meal price before the comped salad.  Not the waitress fault that the kitchen was inept today in performing their job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=40

Jackie N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5,5,,1.0,4/28/2017,"First we went out because it was my mother in law's birthday and my husband's. Absolutely HORRIBLE hostesses. Just a bit of advice... if you want to talk about a customer wait until they can't hear you or read your lips. They were rude. I called ahead asking if it would be busy, they said it shouldn't a problem. When we arrived they said it would take 2 hours for a table. My father in law went in no more than 15 minutes later and asked for Why two tables were empty and if we could just sit there. The hostesses rudely said yes and we were able to seat IMMEDIATELY. We sat down at the table around 6:45 and ordered the food around 6:50. My son got his food at 7:40 and IT WAS AFTER I had asked for it to be brought out as soon as possible. It was corn dogs and fries. There were several tables that sat before us and were served. We did not receive our food until 8:00. The food was cold and the salmon had MULTIPLE bones in it. One of our guests had to LEAVE without even being able to sit and eat because we had waited so long. She had to ask for it to be boxed. The manager didn't even say a word about it. The manager didn't even act like she cared and she looked disheveled. The standards at this restaurant are equivalent to a fast food restaurant, but with colder food. I will continue to tell everyone and anyone not to visit this location if they ever want to be satisfied. A waste of $110, while no one at the party got to eat a good and warm meal.

The bad: -It's very popular.  LOTS of people here at all hours.  It is not surprising to have wait times 1-2 hours on any day of the week at any hour of the evening. -The drinks cost a small fortune.  My wife and I waited two hours for a table one night and thought...""why don't we just have a couple drinks while we wait?""  We did.  We paid our bar tab and then bought dinner and wine.  When we paid for the meal it cost less than the bar bill had for two drinks each. Best way to enjoy the Cheesecake Factory is go an hour or so before you really want to eat and get on the waiting list.  Take a buzzer with you into the mall, shop for a while and then check back.  Otherwise, the wait is too long.  Plan ahead, and it's a nice evening meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=40
Kira S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,17,15,3.0,6/13/2014,"I have been here several times and it is always because it is just a convenient option. As far as chain restaurants go, it is fine. The decor is always awful and quite frankly I have no idea what it has to do with cheesecake. I also wonder why they make their servers dress in white. It seems like a bad idea because they will always look dirty. You just can't keep white clean in a restaurant. I think they want you to feel like you're in heaven but if so, it must be the dodgy part.  The food is decent but I find their portions to be way too large creating inflated prides. Also, their menu is so large it seems impossible for them to make anything amazing food-wise. I do like their cheesecake but I question the amount of unnecessary ingredients they use.  We ordered the white bean chicken chili from the Skinny menu (because we wanted normal portions). And we also shared the kabob appetizer. Both were among the most enjoyable things I've gotten there. The chili was very good and a bit spicy. The kabob could have been better but I wasn't expecting authentic kabob taste. The meat was the disappointing part. The yogurt sauce was good though.    Our waitress last nice gave us an extra 25 minutes to decide on dessert since we weren't ready the first time. I'm not sure where she went but we didn't even see her to flag down in that time period.  Overall this place is fine in a pinch but it will never be among my favorites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=40
Grandin H.,"Sacramento, CA",1,37,,2.0,4/13/2016,"I know exactly what to expect from Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The food is always consistent, they have plenty of choices (maybe even too many), and the cheesecake is rich and delicious. I've been here a few times during off-peak hours and there is sometimes still a wait. The wait on weekends just isn't worth it.  The food is rich. Everything is rich. Sauces, toppings, cheese... and if those weren't heavy enough, they bring warm endless baskets of bread with butter. Hmmm, can anyone really leave without dessert? OK, it's delicious. Yes, it's delicious. But, this isn't the place you want to eat three times a week, or you'll soon be buying a new wardrobe. (Check out their calorie counts for each menu item--some entrees have a whole day's worth of calories--and that's before you add on appetizers, bread, and, of course, the cheesecake!) Enough of that...  The menu is about a half inch thick with lots of variety. It's a 'something-for-everyone' place that offers seafood, meat, poultry, and pasta. Most of the entrees are pasta-based meals in very generous portions. We usually leave with plenty of leftovers to make another meal.  Every Cheesecake Factoy I've ever visited has the exact same menu, the exact same portions, and the exact same decor. Once inside, you can't tell if you're in a Cheesecake Factory in Florida, or a Cheesecake Factory in Pennsylvania, or a Cheesecake Factory in Moscow (if there are any in Moscow!) There is a reason they call this place a 'Factory.' It's like going into an expensive McDonald's--you know exactly what to expect, both good and bad. The decor is 'Bellagio' meets 'Disney World.'  The interior of this place (like all other Cheesecake Factories) is someone's idea of ancient Rome (I think). It looks like the interior of most houses on that old TV show ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' proving that there is no correlation between wealth and good taste.  As everyone else comments, the wait is long--sometimes painfully long--and the seating is often cramped. They don't accept reservations, and the range of the pagers is not too far from the front entrance. The hostess will give you a fairly accurate estimation of how long your wait will be, so you're probably safe taking a walk around the mall and returning reasonably often to ask, 'How much longer....?' That's IF you really want to eat here. When I do go here, I usually plan on a late lunch/early dinner (3PM) or visit on weekday evenings. I have to admit, I started this review with 5 stars, and as I wrote all the negatives, I kept whittling away at stars, until I ended up giving them 2. If you're in the mood for heavy, rich, 'comfort' food, by all means splurge (both calories and $$$) and eat here. I usually go here when friends suggest it.

It felt like MY birthday when my Morning Quesadilla arrived.  There were so many goodies in there, I couldn't believe it.  And goodies on the side, too - heaping piles of salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  So delicious.  I highly recommend.  I also ordered the Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes because I've heard such good things about them.  They tasted almost as good as they smelled which was heavenly.  But after my quesadilla I was only able to eat a portion of the pancakes, even when assisted by my friend.  I took home the leftovers and they were still delicious the next day. I also ordered a piece of Godiva cheesecake to go.  I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a piece of their cheesecake and this was some chocolatey goodness.

Ken P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",18,19,,4.0,7/16/2013,"Part of me doesn't want to like this place, but let's be honest...for the most part, the food is freakin' delicious.  What I'm trying to get past though is the 500 page menu with nothing that is particularly healthy. Also, as a general rule I try to stay away from chains (it helps me feel more snobby). But like I said at the Cheesecake Factory, everything seems to taste great. On our last trip I went with the ""Bang Bang Chicken."" Sure, it wasn't what I'd expect from an authentic Thai restaurant, but I wouldn't have been at the CF if I wanted authentic Thai. For an American take on the dish I'll say it tasted awesome. If nutrition is on your mind, it's a bit tough to navigate the menu. You'll probably be able to get out under 1,000 calories, but you need to know what to look for, limit the alcohol intake and skip dessert. At the end of the day, if you're looking to meet up with friends it's a great venue. Tastes will appeal to almost anyone, the drinks are good, and if you're splurging, the Cheesecake is fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=60

I was wary that with a 15 page menu featuring advertisements the food would not be good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got some sort of Italian thing and it was quite good. It seemed fresh and made today, not freeze-dried. The portions, like everything else in Pittsburgh food, are huge. So huge, we wound up getting our cheesecake to go to eat at home. Not a bad deal, but you'd want to eat it there considering it's called the Cheesecake Factory, not the Generic Styrofoam Take-Out Box Factory.

I was in the mood for something spicy and this did the trick. It wasn't too hot where I was dying while eating, but good enough to get the kick. The chicken was so soft and the shrimp perfectly cooked. The linguine was really good too! Only thing was, it was a bit too oily and kind of heavy. (Sidenote: this dish only comes in full portion. I wish it came in lunch size because it's pretty big.) My friend and I also split a chocolate raspberry cheesecake. At first it's really good! but then it gets to be a bit too rich for my taste.

Darren W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2949,1450,4662,4.0,2/20/2011,"Mission: Lady Kay was owed an official belated St. Valentine's Day dinner. What did the dart land on? Cheesecake Factory. Wanting to avoid the wild, wooly South Side, we came all the way out to the Forbidden Land of Ross Park Mall.  Never before have I ever had to wait for over 2 hours to be seated anywhere. I was reluctant. ""I didn't come all the way out here to eat in a damned mall food court,"" Kay snarled, her hunger making her into someone that was not my beloved. ""But babe, I read that there's a Five Guys, and I always wanted to try..."" I saw cat's eyes, angry cat's eyes staring back at me.  ""Ok, give me the glowing beeper,"" I said to the kid behind the desk.  And off to the Mall we went to burn extra time.  When we returned, we waited another 20 minutes, played peekaboo with a darling baby girl who was being held by her dad, and were then seated.  By this point we were becoming flesh-munching undead.  Cheesecake Factory has a bewilderdingly extensive menu despite being centered around their dizzying varieties of cheesecake.  They also appear to have a fixation on that mobster of the vegetable world; the avocado. It's in half their dishes, from app's to ent's. They purport that their guacamole is as Sheetz sez, M-T-O. However, we already had something to tide us over at the mall, so we went straight for main courses.  I SO wanted to try that fresh guac though. So what did I do? I got it on a burger. No questions asked by our adept server Vicki, no funny stares.  CF calls 'em Glamburgers, and like the cheesecake, there are many different kinds. You'd think they'd have voluminous, teased-up hair and a thing for cocaine and groupies. Mine had American Kobe beef and came with grilled onions and mushrooms, but in addition to the guac, I got mayo, tomato, and lettuce, just to make it...rock.  And for the most part it did. It was served on a sweetly toasted and buttery sesame seed bun and came off like an Eat 'N Park Superburger that fell out of a limo and into a gutter wearing nothing but leather pants and boots.  I'd never had Kobe beef before, so here I was with a chance to try it. Now, it has been THE rage for a long spell. However, I also recall someone on   saying that it tasted like cat food. Hmmm. To my gaping maw, it was just a pretty damn fine burger. It wasn't as transcendent or ascendant as it had been hyped to be nor was it something passe as the Pitchforkesque foodies would have you believe. I mean, as a burger, this falls before the mighty Tessaro's or Cheeburger Cheeburger or Burgatory, but I can't say it would tap out easily. Pink inside, charred blacker than night on the outside, it makes a comeback before succumbing to an armbar in the 4th round.  NIIICE fries, guys, cooked twice 'cause they were illegally crispy/chewy. They come in a metal cup with an inlay of bakery tissue paper which I always find to be a cool, cool touch. The tin cup was HOT, though. Vicki told us she burnt her hand on it. Ow. Shepherd's Pie. A fancy chain like CF happens to have it on their menu (what don't they have?). I've never had it before until last night when I sampled what Lady Kay ordered.  Thumbs up, dude. Mashed potato, minced meat, it all held together well like the Thin Lizzy of old used to (cue the harmonized axe licks). I felt the thick, succulent comfort, y'know?  Dessert would come next, and if the large selection of cheesecake flavors isn't plenty, they have sundaes, cakes, apple cobblers, tiramisu, and even a plain bowl of strawberries. Dilemmas afire!  Inspired by an ill-fated visit to the store of the same name, Kay got the Godiva cheesecake. Feeling Aquarian, I went against the grain and got  Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake, which contains a layer of their Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake. Each is served with clouds of whipped cream and their fresh hot fudge (for extra $).  Eh. Now, I got a gander at their brothel of goodies in the foyer and was tempted, but my chocolate cake turned out to be as what my reg'lars know as a bimbo dessert; all looks, not enough taste. Not that it was horrid. It looked like a dominatrix with all those chocochips acting as studs and was impressive to behold overall. It had a hide like an armadillo in fact. Upon taking a bite though, I could tell that it had been sitting around a while after having been shipped in suspended animation. I can think of a number of indy bakeries in Pittsburgh that best CF at their own game, easily. Fresh is always better.  Kay's cheesecake was a little more interesting, but if Godiva chocolate is that unaffordable, then folks are gettin' swindled. It was chilly and errr...moussy in flavor with a bombastic presentation. Fine to look at, when you get to know her, you find you weren't missing out. The whipped cream was flat and the runny hot fudge only slightly less-so. Yeah, we thought the desserts would rawk too.

I've always gone here on a week day for lunch. There was also a lot of parking near the restaurant too. Everything I've ever tried from The Cheesecake Factory has been delicious - pizza, soup, sandwiches, pastas, salads, appetizers and so on. For your appetizer, you must try the buffalo blasts! They're yummy little deep fried wontons filled with chicken and hot sauce and I think cheese. Then you get little bowls of more hot sauce and bleu cheese. (Seriously thinking about dragging the boyfriend out there for lunch today as I type this...) Their menu, ah their menu. It's such a beautiful place so the ads in their menus always get me. BUT if it's to keep their prices the way they are, I'm all for them. Seriously - a girlfriend and I ordered a lunch sized portion of their BBQ chicken salad for around $11 and there was enough to feed four of us! I'm not complaining though, I love their portion sizes because I love having left overs. Then the cheesecake, ohhh the cheesecake. You have to have it! It runs around $8 a slice but its soooo worth it! I love the vanilla bean, the Reese's peanut butter kind and this past summer they had a pina colada cheesecake. All were divine! The one thing this location in particular lacks is decent service. Every time I've visited our waitress was awful.  One visit in particular went like this: Drinks weren't kept full - we were seated outside in 80+ degree weather, I was 9 months pregnant and drinking water like a fish and the girl refilled our drinks maybe twice and both times with water warm enough to bathe in. She rarely checked on us and when she did and we needed something, she was soooooo slow to return. We needed boxes to take all of our leftovers home in (seriously a ton - buffalo blasts, 3/4 of a pizza, our bread and half of a salad) and she brought us two tiny boxes. Umm, just all of the salad we had fit in those two boxes, she should have been smarter than that. She never offered us dessert, we had to ask. Then it took another year to get it. Then she let us sit there, minus drinks with all of our food packed up, dessert finished, until we flagged her down to get our check. Ridiculous. Did I mention that I was 9 mo pregnant sitting out in that heat minus enough cool water for over two hours because of a crappy waitress? I'm still upset about that and tempted to write the manager. She didn't get a tip. Typically, when I experience crappy service like that, I never go back and I tell every single person I know. BUT the food is that good that you should go back. Again, we had that much left over and we only paid around $30 for it all. It fed my boyfriend and I for the next two days! If I ever get treated like that by a waitress there again, I will have no problem asking for a manager right then and there and telling him what's up. Oh, and another weird thing.

It has a large variety to chose from and it definitely takes a few minutes to look through all of their choices. We ordered the nachos as an appetizers and was a lot more than the 2 of us imagined, (I'm 6'3"" so I'm not some small guy), but we managed to eat what 3-4 people could enjoy.  We ended up taking our cheesecake home for later because of how full we were so its always a treat to have something to look forward to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100
Jim M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,52,3,2.0,9/3/2013,Food was just okay. The shrimp was overdone and not the proper size for a entree dish. The server Patrick B. was one of the worse servers I had in a very long time.   Had no people skills and did not know the menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100
Marlene C.,"Fairmont, WV",44,22,2,4.0,9/13/2010,"I was here for a birthday and let me tell you...the food is really good, our waitress was great (she handled our party of 9 great), and the cheesecake is absolutely wonderful!! I thought it was a bit pricey, but nothing too outrageous.  I'm used to sides coming with the dinners and not paying a la carte for them.  The floor is a bit slick so please watch while walking.  I don't know how the waiters and waitresses didn't slip.  Great food and great fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100
Shanna C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",33,72,11,4.0,11/5/2008,"There's nothing new to be said about The Cheesecake Factory itself - yes it's a big expensive chain (with advertising on every page of their menu). Granted. Since Ross Park Mall is now revitalized with upscale stores, you're limited to the Cheesecake Factory for upscale eating (who wants to shop at Tiffany's and then go to a crowded foodcourt?), aside from the crowded cafes at Nordstroms. During peak shopping times (Anytime on Weekends) be aware of the very long wait ahead of you - an hour, probably. It's going to be busy. However, the vibrating reservation gadgets work all over the mall, so if you're in for a day of light ""do-as-you-please"" shopping or you're only there for one stop it may be a good idea for you to grab a reservation before you start out into the mall. Cheesecake Factories are probably the same expensive, yet delicious, food all over the country. You get what you pay for - especially in the case of the Ahi Carpaccio. It MAY (a HUGE may) rival Nobu for the special place in my heart reserved for raw tuna.  I'm generally unimpressed by their very large salads and pasta dishes. The real stars at The Cheesecake Factory are the appetizers and the cheesecakes themselves. You can never go wrong with the cheesecake varieties. The slices are pretty big, and you may be stuffed from all the food, so it's good to know that they can very neatly split one slice up for two people. A word on the beers: currently they have Blue Moon, Yuengling, and... I'm blanking on the last one. (It's not Guinness, and that's all I care about.) They have many different bottles, in addition to pricey cocktails and wine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100
Tricia S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",86,38,,3.0,12/2/2007,"Although they have the same large (!) menu, service, prices and general decor as the rest of the chain - I was disappointed as the dining area feels more like a cafeteria with their rows of small tables (due to their limited space).  It's a little out of the way, so if I weren't at the mall already I probably wouldn't battle traffic to venture up to the hill top mall area just to dine here. That said, mall parking is free and if you're shopping there anyway (especially during the holidays), it's nice not to have to pack up the car and relocate once you are finally done or need to refuel before getting another fix of your shop-till-you-drop addiction. The curbside-to-go service makes this a nice addition to the North Hills shopping experience, so you might want to jot down their number and pocket a to-go menu (or visit their website) and call in an order before heading home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100
Michael S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,9,,4.0,10/13/2011,"can't get passed the dessert list on the menu. their cheesecake is out of this world good! i always leave with a ""doggy bag"" and end up having to bring my cheesecake home to eat hours later because of how full i get from appetizers and the main dish. great place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100
Rachael B.,"Valencia, PA",7,23,,4.0,3/1/2012,"Great experience, service was very attentive and on top of their game. We had a table of eight and they still managed to keep everyone's drinks filled and the bread basket full. We ordered the artichoke dip as an appetizer; a bit on the disappointing side. The chips were nice and crispy, but a little over-salted. I went with something I knew was good there...the Herb Encrusted Salmon with Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes (ha I write it like it's a move title). Anyways, it never fails to disappoint! They cooked the salmon medium rare (the way it SHOULD be cooked!) and the lemon butter sauce gave a nice sour edge to the entire meal. The decor is nice and laid back, although the lighting gets to be a bit too dim by the end of the night, at least in our section. Sometimes I feel like they crowd their menu a bit too much thus serving a lot of so-so dishes. They could benefit from a good spring cleaning of the menu :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100
Cindy E.,"CRANBERRY TWP, PA",23,2,,1.0,9/4/2011,"OVERRATED!!!  Food was average.  Service was horrible!!!  It took 45 minutes to get our food and waited 20 minutes for our waiter to come back to take our dessert order.  By time he came back the kids were too tired and didn't even want to stay.  It shouldn't take 2 hours for dinner.  Plus, the kids were charged for drinks which should have been included in the kids meal.  Asked the manager to correct the issue and was charged twice.  We will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100
Patrick B.,"Allison Park, PA",0,17,,3.0,8/29/2011,"This is a decent, affordable restaurant.  Every time I visit I have try the passion iced tea and one of the small plate appetizers that range from $4 - $6. they are the perfect portion and price. The restaurant could be better, though.  Having to wait for a table, and then wait another 10 -15 minutes next to the hostess podium to be sat is odd.  The portions are friggin huge, and while they dont charge a fee to share entrees, the chefs will not split the entrees for you, the way they will at Bravo.  The server will hand you another plate and a serving spoon - there ya go, have at it! Charging $7 - $9 for a piece of cheesecake is robbery given that the cheesecake is just defrosted from a cardboard box.  The atmosphere is ugly and outdated, and I always look up to wonder if one of those cone-shaped fixtures is about to fall and impale me.  The service staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, and you can definitely find something on the menu to rave about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100
Linda R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,5,,4.0,3/2/2008,"The factory was over-crowded Saturday night. For two of us, there was about a 90 minute wait. Good thing Ross Park Mall is next door which gave us plenty to do while we waited. I ordered the Hibachi Steak which was fantastic. The service was very good even though we were a little disappointed to be seated in a little corner in the bar area. Even though the place was mobbed, we could still have a nice conversation. I would go back again, but not on a Saturday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-ross-township?start=100
