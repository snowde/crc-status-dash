Leung Y.,"Toronto, Canada",7,38,301,4.0,12/24/2017,"After the 1 star review for the Toronto store, we decided to go Cheesecake Factory in the States :) We went there are lunch time on Dec 23 to the location right next to the busiest mall, and we were able to find parking nearby without paying for the valet service (which is at a extremely reasonable price for crazy holiday times at the mall!).  We went in and got seating right the way, at a great location inside. The waiter service was prompted.  He gave us water, automatically ask if we want lemon with it.  I asked for the brown bread only. I took a picture of the menu, and decide to go for my chubbilicious Chicken Marsala.  My chubby boyfriend got his burger and fries. The food took a while to arrive, and so I used the time for the bathroom.  Good god I love the USA bathroom.  Gigantic stalls and clean!  The water is a bit on the powerful side though.  They are smart enough to put a trash can next to the door, so you don't have to touch the door with you bare hands.  That is thoughtful. Food eventually arrives (after we ate 2/3 loaves of bread from the first basket).  The taste is as good as I remember.  Chicken is soft (4 slices).  Burger meat well cooked and still juicy.  Chicken Marsala pasta is a bit on the greasy side but I knew what I am getting when I ordered. I originally wanted to get the strawberry cheesecake, but got no more room after the large pasta order.  My boyfriend got his usually key lime cheesecake (which I stole a couple bite).  If you don't like whip cream, ask for no whip.  Some lactose intolerance guy argue saying they don't come with whip... and I was right!  Every order come with whip, unless you tell them you don't need it. We got our water refill without asking (but very close to ask). We were seated next to a big party with at least 5 kids and it was quite (despite all the sugar they were having!). I looked and the kids come with plastic cups with straws.  Very thoughtful. Gave it 4 stars only because I the arrival of the food was slow. I will return!  Just have to burn those carloies first before I could return.  The skinny menu options ain't bad, but I am going to the dark side :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento
Gisele X.,"Sacramento, CA",47,223,486,4.0,12/18/2017,"I had a good dining experience tonight at Cheesecake Factory. The two of us were sat quickly, within 5-10 minutes. There were larger parties waiting. Our server, a woman in her 40s-50s, with shoulder-length hair, was our server. She provided stellar service. That was the highlight for me. The pepperoni pizza was ok. The white chocolate caramel macadamia cheesecake was ok. I'm no fan of the airy flavorless puffs they put on the plate. (Sorry for whining.) It's difficult for me to write a review on a large chain restaurant. I'm rarely a fan of chain restaurants. They usually underwow me with the quality of their food offerings. I'm especially not a fan of chains with a lot of blind followers. (It doesn't deserve a wait of more than 10-15 minutes, but doesn't every location always have an outrageous wait time?) I've been to Cheesecake a dozen times or so in the past 20 years. I'll go (once in a while) if that's what someone really wants, but meh, I could live without. Four stars because the service was great and the food was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento
Ray H.,"Carmichael, CA",4,73,58,1.0,12/16/2017,"In the last month we've been here three times. First time Oscar was our server. He was very good. If we asked if they could make something a little different he would go and check. He was  very accommodating and deserves 5 stars.    Then we had somebody she never told us her name but the first thing she did when she came over was to ask if we wanted bread?  That seemed unusual because we've been coming here over 20 years and I servers just bring you the bread to the table. It maybe she's stupid because when we asked her what the difference was between two dishes she said the sauce was just different. The statement the sauce is just different is so ambiguous what is that supposed to tell the customer? It turned out one dish was covered with cold chopped tomatoes vs a tasty lemon-garlic sauce (a male perhaps the kitchen manager knew exactly what we wanted THANKFULLY)   Tonight we've been sitting at a table for an hour, when I finally got my strawberry smoothie (i will say is very very good). I ordered an appetizer which came out the same time as my entree. Seriously am I suppose to eat both of the same time?  So they said they would bring the entree out later. Little did I realize it would be the same entree burnt marks and all.    Lucky for us our waitress was taking a break from the gentleman who replaced her seems to have his active gather whoever it is thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento
Diana L.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,87,83,5.0,1/13/2018,"Decided to try Cheesecake Factory's weekend brunch.  Wonderful menu selection!  Family ordered the lunch-size meatloaf dish, chicken & waffles, French toast with a ham steak, & the lemon ricotta pancakes.  All were delicious!  Service was great!  Weekday lunches and dinners here are great!  Although, we highly recommend their weekend brunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento
Joseph T.,"Sacramento, CA",17,30,48,5.0,12/28/2017,"I came for Happy Hour, and I had one of the most best Happy Hour experiences of my life. I usually go to restaurants for Happy Hour, and am usually disappointed by the subpar selection. However, not with this place. I had 3 drafts on tap, 3 humongous plates of food, and complimentary bread!  The ambiance was smooth yet lively. And the best part about it was that I was treated like a King. Tim was my bartender, and he was super friendly, yet professional. He checked in with me quite often to see if I needed anything, and I didn't ""feel rushed."" I will definitely be going back!!

Yao C.,"Sacramento, CA",231,343,3616,3.0,8/27/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is always so so busy! This place is a great place for large parties, family get togethers, and even romantic dates! The bar area is cool because it's large with tvs so you can eat appetizers and watch the football games!  Parking is okay, can get very busy but there is plenty of parking because it's connected with the mall. They also have valet parking as well. Food is average, nothing spectacular! They have a wide variety of choices which is good when you bring a large group but I feel the food is only mediocre.  I've had their burgers, to pastas to the steak. Just recently I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and it was very dry... the chicken was not moist but the chipotle mayo was good. I also tried the BBQ burger and again, it was dry.... overcooked. The fries are crispy and good but the burgers are only so so. My lady had the fish tacos and they were good, not great. You can have your fish tacos either fried or grilled and we had it grilled which was a good decision....  We tried 3 different apps... the deep fried mac and cheese balls, stuffed mushrooms and fried zucchini! The mushrooms were small and you only get 6... flavor blend.... the zucchini was small and lacked flavor. The fried mac and cheese balls were really good... good batter and flavor... my favorite of the night. Cheesecake is their signature dish.... i tried the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and it was good and light but too much whip cream!  Overall, it's a fun place for get togethers but food is only mediocre.... not bad but not stunning!  Lastly, they do not take reservations and you have to be prepared to wait at least 35-40 minutes! Solid 3 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento
Rosa P.,"Sacramento, CA",23,102,61,2.0,9/13/2017,"What happened?!  What happened to the ONE chain restaurant I could always count on in Sacramento. Ugh, what a disaster.  If Monday wasn't already shitty enough, Cheesecake made sure to put the final nail in the coffin.  Got to CF with friends around 7/710p. We waited abt 10 min to be greeted by our waitress and waited abt another 10 for water. I asked for straws as I hate drinking straight from the cup. ( I know, I'm a psycho). After the third time, I eventually ended up asking another waitress for the damn straws.  We were finally able to order and also asked her for more bread while we waited. After asking twice, she brings more bread and ends up spilling my water all over the table, my sweet potato fries and my lap. Sigh.... at this point, I thought: maybe she's busy and stressed? Idk, I try to give ppl the benefit of the doubt.  That changed when my meal came. We didn't get our dinner until after 8p and my meal was just a plate of orange chicken. Lol no rice. My friend ordered the Carne Asada steak medallions and it was three pieces of meat while the rest of the plate was covered in rice and whatever else they threw on there to make it look full.  Once our food arrived, our waitress disappeared. Never saw her again. Up until it was time for her to get the tab paid.  We eventually asked for the manager as the entire night was just one failing disaster after another. He was attentive and ended up giving us 25% off our tab. He left aaaaannnndddd our waitress never came back! After waiting for her for about 15 min, we ended up walking up the hostess to find us someone to help close us out.  I was craving CF soooo bad and this experience just sucked balls. I was disappointed in the way we were waited on. She was hardly attentive and seemed like everything we asked for was a nuisance. (But it was all basic shit we should have gotten) I usually always sit in the bar area and am always treated so awesome by the staff there.  I really wanted a piece of cheesecake, but by the end of the night I just wanted to get out of there. Dammit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento
Kelly C.,"Davis, CA",304,172,200,3.0,11/12/2017,"This Cheesecake factory location is smaller than most. With the limited seating, there is usually a long wait time, so when my boyfriend and I went around dinner time on a Friday night, I was expecting the wait to be longer than 30 min. However, after waiting exactly 25 minutes, we were seated.  Food is not that great. Super oily/greasy and HUGE portions (it's what they're known for). I got a pasta dish and was able to eat 1/3. I took the other to go. My boyfriend on the other hand was super hungry and ate it all. One thing I do love about the cheesecake factory, is the brown bread!! I usually ask for seconds.  The cheesecake is bomb, but I never have room to eat it after such a large meal. (but you can order the cheesecake to go!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento
Leilani L.,"Sacramento, CA",203,60,66,3.0,9/11/2017,"So... I'm pretty sure I picked the worst Monday to go to CF. Normally, service would be outstanding. My food is usually fantastic and brought out in a decent amount of time. Giving them 3 stars because of all of the other pleasant experiences there, prior to this one. Here's what happened, yes, all in one night: never got a soup spoon with my bowl of soup, (it's a giant bowl), we asked for straws three times with two different people, our server spilled water all over our table and my friend by accidentally dropping the butter dish for the bread, they replaced the fries that the water spilled on, but not her utensils and napkin. Our server was completely apologetic but I felt like we had to ask for everything! This is only for the service.... Now for the kitchen: it took about 45 mins for our food to come out. We waited so long that the booth behind us had 2 different parties that had come and gone. Also, My friend that got spilled on ordered orange chicken with extra vegetables and white rice. Our server wrote it down right but the kitchen plated it without rice. My other friend ordered carne asada medallions with rice... her poor plate had 3 chunks of meat on it... it looked like the saddest plate in the world! If you're hungry, don't order that! I know I sound like I'm just complaining but this was bad this time around. We did speak to the manager and he tried to make it better but I feel like this last time around may be the last.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento
Allen Y.,"West Sacramento, CA",133,67,169,4.0,10/31/2017,"They have the best cheesecake! I mostly come here to grab a slice and leave. You can order a slice by going up to the front counter where the cheesecake display is and order a whole cake or a slice. And you just pay and leave. Simple and fast. I rarely dine in. The food was good but nothing to rave about. First time, I had the garlic lemon chicken. It was cooked in a fire oven and was super juicy and delicious. The lemon juice really shines through. It came with cooked carrots and mash potatoes. Carrots were not cooked all the way so it was still hard. Mash potatoes were definitely like a 2/5. But hey, at least they nailed the protein which really matters. I have tried their pastas and burgers dishes but they were nothing to rave about.  My friends always come here to get me a slice of cheesecake to go on my birthday. So if any of my friends are reading this, you know what to get me for my birthday.

Julie P.,"Northern California, CA",6,147,460,3.0,5/29/2017,"What the heck happened to the Cheesecake Factory? We sat at one of the tables in the bar area  for faster service. There were 2 of us and we sat at table with 4 seats. There were already 4 small appetizer plates and 4 silverware sets.  We ordered the French onion soup and Thai lettuce wraps. The lettuce wraps were good , no complaints. It came with noodles, carrots, cucumbers and bean sprouts. And chicken satay of course. There was peanut sauce and a ginger sauce. The 3rd sauce was good but I'm not sure what it was made out of. There were large pieces of lettuce to wrap all the goodies in.  The French onion soup was lame. There was not enough cheese in it. Not sure if this was the ""low cal"" version or what.   Service was ok. I do like to be left alone when I'm at a restaurant.  The biggest disappointment has to be those 4 plates on the table. Each and every one of those small appetizer plates had food particles stuck to them and looked visibly dirty.. Greasy finger marks or something !! I opened all the silverware and there was food stuck to those as well! Disgusting. This is why I prefer to eat at home.   Maybe it's time for a new dishwasher! Gross.  The best part about our visit today was the carrot cake :) Maybe the crummy-ness of the experience has to do with the shit hole area it's in. The Arden area by the mall is nasty.

In spite of the place being packed, I felt the service didn't even feel the pinch.  Our waitress was good...in spite of being spread thinly across all the tables she served. The food was okay.  I ordered medium-well and from what I received, it looked more like well-done...but the wife insisted that at my age, I should always order well-done, so I guess that was good(?).  Presentation was also good.  It could've been better.  And the cheesecakes for dessert were huge and heavy.  We shared a cheesecake and ordered a few more to go.

I always got the Steak Diane and it was just lovely. It was always cooked to perfection! Definitely recommend for you mean eaters!  I've been trying to eat less meat and dairy, so I ordered the vegetarian burger this time with a dude of fries. The burger was not tasty at all, it broke apart as soon as I grabbed it and wasn't cooked/mixed well because the rice and beans they used was still in tact. Do not recommend this.  I'm also really upset about the fact they charge for their Special ranch sauce that I used to have with their brown (wheat) bread. This wasn't too pleasing to me and actually took me back given that we pay a good amount per portion. Other than that, the overall experience is usually and was this time really good.

Henry L.,"San Mateo, CA",2337,833,2811,4.0,1/28/2017,"Nice The place is located right outside of the mall. You actually have to walk outside for quite a while to get to it, because it's near the outside boundary of the parking lot. Outside, the structure looks huge, like some kind of church. Inside, the decoration is also fancy, with paintings on the wall, dim lighting, and lots and lots of customers waiting for tables. You get a vibrating device that notifies you when your table is ready. There is a huge cheesecake counter right next to the waiting area so you will be more than hungry before you sit down looking at all the cheesecake! The service are all quick and friendly. The food took a while to come out, but that's only because they have so many customers. The food was amazing! I got the Factory sandwich, which was actually toasted hard on the outside. There was lots of beef and ingredients. The angel hair pasta was also cooked pretty nicely, served warm and and lots of flavor. The Cosmo cocktail was fruity and sweet. Finally, the free bread was awesome, especially the black bread which actually tasted sweet.

Nicole B.,"Elk Grove, CA",269,211,644,4.0,7/10/2017,"My two cents on Cheesecake  Atmosphere-  Usually located in most midsize and large cities.Besides Sac I have been to Walnut Creek, LA, Atlanta, with San Francisco being my favorite.  Spacious, good size bar,  plenty of seating. Casual while being slightly elegant.  Great place for a casual date, family, outing or special occasion.   Service- Like most chains hit or miss. Some occasions service is stellar. Can get prompt, friendly, efficient service. Other times you can get a subpar server, and service can be slow.  Food-  The highlight of Cheesecake factory is the wide variety of their menu. From the burgers, salads, appetizers, to full size entrees they have something for everyone. Servings are generous and the food is always tasty. Wide variety of cocktails that are delicious with many creative non alcohol drinks as well.

Robert S.,"Vallejo, CA",96,1,1,1.0,6/24/2017,"Let me begin this review by saying I've never been inclined to post a review before. The fact that I've been driven to it in itself should say a lot about my experience here. We were seated quickly and our server came and asked us what we would like to order, we ordered and that was the last time we would see him for the next 45 mins. Once the food arrived (sent by someone else) one of our orders was wrong ( we asked for cheese on our sliders they came to the table without). We informed the person who brought our food of the mistake and it was taken back to the kitchen to be corrected.  When the sliders came back the cheese had been torn (by hand) and tiny broken pieces were added to each slider. The manager ""apologized"" rushing us asking again and again as we tried to address the issue ""well do you want the sliders taken of the bill?"" The original server (who mysteriously returned to serve the table next to us again and again throughout this ordeal) instead of apologizing issued excuses for both his absence (I was busy with other tables) and the poor quality of the food (it was the kitchen)  As I began with I don't ever review on yelp I'm a pretty even keel person and know that bad service can be the result of a bad day and I would hate to do something to potentially hurt a business or endanger a job but service from our server to management was lacking. I will be sending this review to corporate as well hopefully they can do better for other customers but I will not be back personally.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=20
Terri N.,"Concord, CA",533,725,2908,4.0,6/28/2017,"Consistently good experiences here!   Once you get past the overwhelming nature of the Cheesecake Factory experience and are a seasoned pro, no longer startled by their menu so large it contains advertising space, their reliability and predictability can make them a very safe and satisfying option. Whether that's a good or bad thing is entirely up to you! As for me, I dig it!  I have two very safe go-to meals at the Factory - their fantastic Thai For White People dish called Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp (coconut peanut heaven, and easily 3 meals on one plate), and their killer Club Sandwich, probably the best club sandwich I've ever had. Generous of course, with nice fresh ingredients, but what makes it for me is some sweetness in the sandwich bread - it elevates the sandwich into the heavens and makes it so much more than savory. And everything at the Factory makes wonderful leftovers - which they must anticipate, with their insane portion sizes.  Don't forget about the cheesecake!  And disregard so many other reviewers throwing caloric shade on dessert - don't kid yourself about where you're eating dinner. And friendly reminder, they are more than happy to box up a slice of cheesecake for you, which for me always last a couple days! Everything in moderation, including moderation. And if you still doubt, don't forget you can order a bowl of fresh strawberries for dessert too, you silly people you. But you could also score a slice of their amazing lemon meringue cheesecake, or the glorious red velvet, or the orgasm that is the Limoncello cream torte. Go big - the Factory wants you to.  Always keep in mind that this place is a gold mine, and they don't take reservations! A wait is damn near guaranteed. Don't get mad at them for being popular, and attached to a mall! I will definitely be back. A visit to Cheesecake Factory is like a visit to a reliable old friend - you know what to expect, and you know you'll walk away smiling.

Nathan Y.,"Carmichael, CA",175,308,72,3.0,6/19/2017,"Holy cripes, this place is packed. It was super-crowded, but fortunately, there's a fast turnover, so we didn't have to wait too long for a seat. The service was fast, but it was rather inattentive (which I found ironic given that we were surrounded by Eye of Saurons decorating the seating area). The dirty dining floor and restrooms needed cleaning. Our waiter also forgot one of our entrees. It was actually a hidden blessing that he forgot because the portions we got for everything else were huge. First, we were given 3 servings of bread for 2 people. The sweet multi-grain bread tasted amazing with the slightly-salty butter. Neither of us liked the rye bread, but it's not like either of us were compelled to finish it. Second, my gf got full off the appetizer dish by itself. I ordered the Flying Gorilla, a chocolate alcoholic mixer. It was like a really good spiked chocolate milkshake, and I highly recommend it. The fried calamari appetizer was crispy and overall quite tasty. The tomato basil pasta with chicken was average, but enjoyable. All of this was comfort food. The dishes were expensive, but they were also huge, so order accordingly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=20

Kevin K.,"Berkeley, CA",527,188,514,2.0,12/23/2016,"The Mediocre Factory . . . It's easy to be taken in by the ""classy"" ambiance of the Cheesecake Factory, but it really is all just smoke and mirrors.  The food isn't that great at all, and HORRIBLY overpriced.   I know I like to whine about overpriced food on yelp from time to time, but Cheesecake Factory really prices their food too high.  I don't think a bacon cheeseburger is worth $15.  Pasta da vinci, albeit decent, isn't worth $18 either.  It's just pene pasta with chicken in wine sauce.  I could make that at home for $4.     Obviously the food does indeed taste decent, but it's definitely a splurge every time I come here.  I don't quite get the huge hype surrounding the CF.   When my friends and I were served our food the other night, we all started eating and almost immediately, my friend found a hair in her pasta and it took a while for us to wave down our waitress, Jess to send the dish back.  Hair is always a disgusting find in a dish.  Needless to say, it seemed that our experience at the CF was turning into a CF. It wasn't Jess' fault.  It was a very busy night at Cheesecake.  It was just sad because my friend had a delay in her eating.  Jess apologized profusely and was very polite about getting my friend a new dish.  The manager even came right up and apologized and comped her entree from the bill.   It was a really nice display of customer service. Jess took wonderful care of us during the whole time though.  Even though I'm not super big on the food at CF, I know good customer service when I see it, and Jess definitely had it.   I ordered a burger and my friends all ordered pasta dishes, with which we were fairly pleased.  I don't like getting little cups of ketchup delivered to me with my burger.  Just give me the bottle please so I can properly drown my burger and fries in ketchup!  It's nice to look classy, but not with ketchup.  It's not amazing food, but it was alright and I had a really nice time with my friends on their last night in town. I definitely wouldn't class my food as anything above mediocre, but it was made up for by the exceptional customer service we experience there from Jess and the manager who was so accommodating.   None of this changes the fact that I just don't really like the food (or the prices, omg) at Cheesecake factory.  It's a lovely looking place with nice and helpful staff, but that's about it. Good job to Jess though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=20

I always take my left overs home and they're always still pretty good the day after.  My last visit there, for our appetizers we ordered the crab bites and stuffed mushrooms. Now these portions were really small. Came with about 6 pieces each. They were literally bite sized pieces.  For our main dishes we ordered the everything pizza, and the jambalaya pasta. I wasn't too big on the pizza, nothing about it really stood out to me. The jambalaya said it was going to be in a very spicy sauce, but I felt it was mild. The shrimp and chicken pieces were very tender and juicy. As for the sauce of the pasta, it was just ok to me. Again, nothing stood out.  For dessert we ordered the salted caramel cheesecake. And holy moley! It was sweet. Very rich and creamy. And their slices are always very generous.

Our server never introduced herself and when she asked us what we wanted to drink...I asked for water...she rolled her eyes and walked away immediately. She came back about 5 mins and brought our waters and stale bread. We didn't say anything. We were deciding to get a bottle of wine but we asked if we can get a sample first of the 2 sweets ones. She rolled her eyes and again walked away without saying anything...at this point I feel like we bother her. Brought our wine about 15 mins later with 2 glasses and knowing we have 3 people dining. So we asked for another glass and once again showed us the biggest attitude. We asked if we can order our appetizer...ummm isn't it your job to ask us what we want to get?! I told her ""excuse me, hey girl!"" (to get her attention since she never introduced herself to us) and she said ""my name is Jessica ok"" lol ok sorry! I feel like she don't want to deal with us at all. We were seated for more than an hour and still without any food on our table besides the stale bread. I asked for the manager and told her about the situation..she changed our server to D'andre. Omg this guy is the best!!! He was very entertaining and super attentive! We just loved him. He took our orders, we got Thai lettuce wraps, truffle-honey chicken, and steak Diane.. which we really enjoyed! He was chatty and really made our dinner very enjoyable. We got our food in a timely manner as well. He made sure everything was good and I couldn't ask for anything more. We also ordered 3 oreo cheesecakes to go and another item. We gave him a big tip after that. 3 stars because food was superb and outstanding customer service from D'andre and all negative coz of Jessica.

Something like this usually from experienced management and staff.  2. CONSISTENTLY GREAT FOOD- Ive never had a bad order here and the one I did i remember the manager came out to apologize and they replaced it entirely.  3. GREAT SELECTION FOR BUDGET - their factory combination is a great way to get a good selection for great price and satisfying portions.  4. GREAT LOCATION - As always great location right next to Arden Mall and the movie places along with other good places in the arden fair area.  5. NEEDS CHANGE - The only thing I would say is that since they have optimized the business operations thst they should start innovating some new things to expand the cheesecake factory brand into either new ways to present their product or introduce a new product in a new segment.

Leslie D.,"Sacramento, CA",66,2,1,1.0,8/7/2017,"Embarrassingly disappointed. It was family tradition to dine here for my birthday celebration every year (since I was 18, I'm 22 now), but I'm sad to say it's time for a change. The wait was exactly 30 mins so not mad about that, but it all started going downhill when the lady seated us at our table pulling a chair out into the middle of the walkway when I preferred sitting on the booth side so I had to push the chair back in and make my way to the booth.. not a big deal just annoying. Then our server came by and we ordered drinks and you guessed it, he totally forgot mine. I just knew he should've taken notes before he even left the table. I still gave the server the benefit of the doubt and assumed he was new and poorly trained.  20 mins after waiting for the server to take down our order, we waited a whole 45 mins before food got to us.. and it wasn't even our food. This lady came to our table with fried macaroni like no, not us but seriously where's our food. Quit playing. One guy literally had 1 table and kept passing them multiple times.. seriously a waste of productivity. It was so unorganized like did all the managers and experienced workers go on vacation or.  Another 15 mins later, entres come out.. before appetizers. Now I'm not even mad anymore, just confused. So let's talk about the entre, farfalle specifically terrible there was a piece of string cheese in it, looked more like a lunch potion than a dinner one trust me I would know since that is the only thing I get from this place. Got charged for the farfalle with chicken when I got it without the chicken, makes no sense. Okay appetizers, don't recommend any of them: tater tots, fried zucchini, nachos all a big thumbs down. I mean factory nachos were a go-to until they burned it.. like how does that happen? The chips were brown, anyone could see that even under the dim light. Yet the server, Theodore who insisted we call him Teddy, (firstly you aren't sweet nor cute like a Teddy so no one is going to call you that) even questioned me like wth, dumb (bleep) you eat it then mf.  Then dessert time rolled around and we would've gotten cheesecakes but unfortunately I was nervous about waiting another hour or Theodore not getting the order right, so we paid our dues and ran for our lives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=40

Also got a complimentary sundae with a candle! The food was delicious and left us all stuffed. Which saddened me because if you're visiting here, you want to taste the cheesecake. I couldn't eat any there, but bought two pieces to enjoy at home. I've only had a forkful of the key lime cheesecake and I can see why this place is so popular. Was a bit pricy, but less than $100 for 3 people and extra cheesecake is pretty nice.  Only thing that was bad was a friend of mine ordered a burger well done, but she got it rare.

Someone somewhere messed up and didn't order  correctly to keep their inventory full. The server told us they were out of most of the items by noon.

Karen R.,"Elk Grove, CA",54,46,45,4.0,4/22/2017,"Came in on a Saturday night. Super packed. We had a group of 5 with a 35 minute wait.  We started with appetizers, they were delicious!  The spinach dip & chips is a MUST ($12). So is the cheesy garlic bread ($10) I'm very impressed.  Next time I'll just order appetizers instead of dinner.  For dinner I had the Steak Diana plate cooked medium ($20). The sauce included caramelized onions and mushrooms. The plate came with the steak already cut up into small chunks and a buttery mashed potatoes. My plate was a solid 5 star meal.  It wasn't dry at all, just all around juicy. And the portion was just right.  My mom ordered the Chicken Marsala($19) and she enjoyed the chicken, but she didn't like the pasta it came with. My dad ordered the Carne Asada medallions ($15)  and it came with rice and corn. He also said he enjoyed his plate but he expected a more flavor. My brother has the Chicken fettuccine Alfredo ($20) and it was a decent portion. Clearly, there was no room for dessert so we all ordered a cheesecake to go. They were all a huge $8 slice.  In the end we ordered 4 cokes ($4 each) , 2 appetizers, 4 dinner plates, & 3 cheesecakes and the total came out to $145.00. I personally thought it was a lot of money for a restaurant that super fancy or anything, but again the food was good. So I would totally come here again but only for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary or something. It just seems a little over the top to pay $145 for 4 people to have dinner (my own opinion of course). Hence my 4 star rating. I wouldn't come just to have a week night dinner.  The pricing here is a little too much for me.  Also, our server, Jamad was great. Very very friendly and despite the busyness he had going on, he did check on us and make sure we were all satisfied at all times.

Parker H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,6,2,1.0,12/29/2017,Worst burger I've ever had plus shitty service. Started off ordered a burger and added cheese to it. I was patiently waiting for my burger and was wondering where the hot bread was and never received it. I haven't been here in a while so I thought they stopped serving it but noticed on other tables around me that they had bread. So sitting there starving with just water at the table about 20 minutes goes by which isn't bad my burger comes out and it has lettuce and tomato on one side of the bun and the burger on the other side which looks like a piece of charcoal just burnt with NO CHEESE. I flagged down the waitress told her that the burger didn't have cheese and she said the burger I ordered doesn't come with cheese and I specifically added cheese to the original order which she forgot I did and remembered when I reminded her. She walks away I continue to eat my fries and my dried up burger that no one wants even at a BBQ just sitting there waiting for cheese finally the waitress brings out a slice of cheese on a hot plate that's partially melted to the plate and have to peel it off and put it on my cold burger that's been sitting there for a good 15 minutes and my fries were gone in the process of waiting. So instead of getting a new hot burger she gave me a flimsy piece of Macdonald's cheese to put on a cold burger. I was so hungry I ate it anyway and it was completely disgusting had no flavor and was cold and burnt. After I ate the nasty burger they brought out bread I mean really ? Too little too late. My girlfriend gave a one dollar tip which I told her to put 0 but her pasta dish was okay. I'm sorry but Cheesecake Factory sucks the service sucks and the food is over priced. The only reason why I went there is because of a gift card we had. I can make a burger 1000 times better than the piece of burnt bs I had. I definitely won't be going back.

The waiter didn't even ask if we enjoyed our food. It was obvious they were understaffed. I felt bad for our waiter who had way more tables than one could handle. Took forever to even get the bread, let alone our food. The fries we got were hardly warm and you could tell they had been sitting for a while.

Todd B.,"Olivehurst, CA",0,73,,3.0,9/7/2017,"So, my reviews always start out with 5 stars and I take one star away for every negative I experience. On the positive side, the food was good. It is the same as every Cheesecake Factory so you can expect some consistency there. But really, does anyone go there for the food or the cheesecake? You go for a bite to eat and a piece or cheesecake right. My cheesecake of choice? The Dulce de Leche cheesecake. Hands down. There were specials there as well like the double chocolate something and birthday cake cheesecakes but my favorite will always be what I order. The waiter was polite. The hostess greeted us and sat us as soon as they could. So, yah. I would recommend this Cheesecake Factory and will probably go there again.  Why the loss of 2 stars then since I liked it so much? Hands down the prices are way too high. My wife and I got 2 chicken plates, 2 ice teas and 2 pieces of cheesecake. $100. $3.50 for an ice tea that we had a hard time getting refilled. So the prices have gotten a little out of touch. Maybe next time we will eat before and just go there for the desert. My second star was removed for a combination of factors. First the restaurant was busy so we had to wait for a couple minutes. No big deal and no star removed for that. But when we were sat we got the tiny table in the back corner that always seems to be forgotten about. So as we waited at this tiny table we were overlooked by our server a couple times. I would have waited another 10-15 minutes just for a real table. Anyway, not too shabby. Just next time we will maybe share a dinner and get our cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=60

Vince L.,"Sacramento, CA",229,605,159,4.0,7/5/2017,I came to try the THAI COCONUT-LIME CHICKEN. It did not disappoint. It was absolutely delicious. The curry was mild and you definitely taste the coconut milk. I also really liked the shiitakes in it. The only thing that I thought was a bit odd was that they didn't peel the stem portion off the snow peas. Kinda odd but you couldn't eat it. The portions were large and The service was great. I also got there early enough to get a Mojito during happy hour. It was a little sweeter than I care for and you really can't taste the alcohol.

Last year, I ordered a cheesecake for my fiancée 24 hours before pick up and when I got there, my order was not written down. Luckily, they had a 10 inch in the back and charged me for the 7 inch (what I ordered). Today, I ordered a 7 inch for my little brother and when I got there, once again, they said it was not written down. On top of that, they only had 6 slices, so my little brother had half a cake for his birthday. He loves cheesecakes. How sad!! They didn't even apologize. Why don't the employees write down orders???

Jason H.,"Hayward, CA",4,269,198,3.0,8/19/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a okay place to come. It is overpriced for decent food. Dishes are $15 plus and for the taste and quality I don't believe it is worth it at all.  I ordered the Mac and cheese bites but guess what they were out! Thanks, I've always wanted my dreams crushed during the first 5 minutes of my date. Ordered the cheese dip which was good but not $9 good. The only salvageable food this place has to offer is obviously the desserts and even then they run for about $8 or $9 a slice!!!!! That is way too much for a single slice of cheesecake. If you have money to throw away or waste, come here. The best cheesecakes are cookie dough, red velvet, Oreo dream cheesecake, chocolate cheesecake, pumpkin cheesecake. If you really want cheesecake, it's better to eat and then come here for dessert, that way you only spend a fraction of the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=60

But a few days ago, I had a pretty frustrating experience. I got in line at the bakery to pay for my pre-ordered cheesecake. Once I got to the register, I was told I had to pay for it at a different register in the front. Given, there was an 8×11 hand written piece of paper stating that is where we pay for it, but unless you really stop to read everything you won't see it. So I went to pay for it, went back to the other register to make sure they saw my receipt and order and then waited. Understanding it was Christmas Eve day i figured it would take a while but more than 30 minutes go by and everyone who paid after me had already left. I went to ask about it and got my cheesecake within less than 5 minutes. Their explanation for the delay: there were 2 of the same cheesecakes sitting out there for a while with no names on it so no one did anything about it. Next time, put a sign where it's visible to everyone standing in line so they know not to pay there and if theres food/dessert sitting out for a while then figure out where it goes.

The service could at times be a little slow but it's understandable because the place gets very busy especially at lunch time. Today, we had lunch here. As expected, it was very busy. But we were given a table right away. Our server, her name was Sonia. She was very nice but I could tell she was very busy and at times perhaps even overwhelmed. But she managed very well. She took care of us ok and I was pleased with her service and attention. She brought us their signature bread and butter. The dark brown sweet bread is just to die for! Our food came shortly after. I ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta. It was very good. For desert we ordered the Linda chocolate cake. Trust me - you can't go wrong with that! Over all, we had a good experience.

Terryann T.,"Sacramento, CA",38,71,70,5.0,6/29/2016,"We came here on a Tuesday right after lunch and it was crazy packed! I guess because it is one of the better restaurants by the mall. There was a 15 minute wait but it didn't feel that long.  I ordered the combo Steak Diane/Chicken Madeira, which came with mushrooms, asparagus and mash potatoes. My mother got the Philly Cheesesteak and my dad got the Hibachi Steak. My food was so delicious and cooked perfectly, there was way too much mashed potatoes but they were better than expected. I had mushrooms with both of my dishes so that was great. My dads said said his steak was great as well but again too much mashed potatoes.  The only bad part of the meal was that my mother did not like her cheesesteak, the meat was kind of tough and the bread was as well. I think it was the same type of sourdough that was brought out when we sat down.  We were so full from lunch that we didn't even have room for the cheese cake, oh well, maybe next time!

Jamie C.,"Sacramento, CA",223,180,1172,4.0,4/10/2016,"I have been craving spaghetti and was excited to see they have a spaghetti dish on their menu! I ordered that and my friend got the Louisiana chicken pasta. The spaghetti was really good. Those meatballs are no joke! They were so big and so yummy. The Louisiana chicken pasta is actually one of my usual dishes here. My friend ended up ordering that and I got to have the best of both worlds! Lucky me. That crusted chicken in the pasta has so much flavor. Total yumminess! The pasta can feel pretty heavy though, sometimes. It's pretty greasy. Probably all that butter they use to cook it, but it's good. We also ordered the loaded potato tots. I thought the tots were going to be actual tots with toppings on top like a nacho, but they're actually mashed potato deep fried with bacon and cheese inside, served with sour cream on the side. They were good. I like anything potato and fried. ;) The complimentary bread is so good. They serve the wheat bread warm and butter just melts on top. I always try not to eat so much bread, so I have room for my food, but that never happens. Their dishes are really big too. My friend and I both didn't finish our dishes. And we felt we still had a full dish by the end of our meal. Two people could share a dish if they wanted.  They have really good cheesecakes. I always come here wanting a cheesecake at the end of my meal, but most of the time, I never have room for it! Depending on when you come, there can be quite a wait for a table.

Monique A.,"Pittsburg, TX",935,327,1180,5.0,3/14/2016,"I have always enjoyed coming here for dinner or lunch. They offer lunch portions and a skinny menu. Be prepared most items are very high in calories but I think that's the point when you come. Portions are very large and way too many options. Today I started with the Beets and goat cheese salad. This is always been my favorite. It's light not a heavy dressing and the portion is on the appetizer menu so it's perfect to start off before your main meal. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken over brown rice and it was a huge portion, I recommend that is big enough for two people if you're not that hungry or you want to eat light. The chicken to me wasn't that spicy may be a little bit more on the saltier side because of the sauce. The cashews were really crisp and the brown rice was really good too.  My son ordered the shrimp and sausage pasta, he said he would give it 8 out of 10. I tasted it it's not one of the best pastas for an Italian dish but certainly it's a hearty dish and not too bad.  Lastly we both ordered cheesecake, of course you cannot leave here without ordering one of the 25 + types of cheesecake they offer. We ordered the raspberry cheesecake and a Tiramisu cheesecake to go. I haven't tasted it yet but no doubt it's going to be really good. One cheesecake I would recommend that I've tried is the red velvet cheesecake, very high in calories I believe it's at 2100 cal but it's so good so share with somebody.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=80
W. L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,35,13,4.0,7/26/2017,"A friend and I had lunch at this restaurant yesterday. The front desk was very efficient in arranging for a table for us. The waitress was also very efficient. I ordered a lunch-size salad. The ingredients were fresh, the portion was huge, and the dish tasted very good. I got the worth of the money spent.  As compared to the hostess at the front desk, our waitress was basically doing her job but her non-verbal communication conveyed a sense of unfriendliness in a very subtle manner. She did all the necessary actions, such as taking our orders, replacing a knife that was dirty to begin with and saying sorry about that, asking how we were doing every now and then even when the place was very busy. However, her facial expression and the way she spoke (sort of in a relatively cold manner) conveyed the unfriendly tone underneath. It  could be that, she was in a bad mood herself yesterday and this had nothing to do with us. I do not know whether she realized what her own non-verbal communication was saying to the customers or not. If she had been as friendly as the hostess, this dining experience would have been perfect!

Ian A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,3,2.0,7/31/2017,"I have been a fan of the TCK establishment for a while. One of my favorite dishes is the Beef Pit Dip where at every location my Beef Pit Dip is served with the typical arrangement of sandwich and au jus dipping broth. I don't know why this location on Arden Way did not follow through with this and essentially offended me when asking for help. Upon receiving my To-Go order and checking the contents, I saw that the sandwich's namesake was missing from the order, the au jus, leaving me with a dry sandwich of bread and meat and cheese (NOT a french dip). I contacted the location and they said I could fight for a refund. I said I only wanted to just stop by and pick up my au jus dipping broth which is typically part and parcel of the ""french dip"" experience that I have come to know from The Cheesecake Factory. When I arrived, I was told to stand to the side and wait for my au jus. After 20-25 minutes of waiting, a waitress comes from the back and before walking towards me turns to some holier-than-thou manager types and they collectively give me a good look.  The waitress then approaches me with a small plastic container, say 1 ounce to 2 ounce condiment container with a brown liquid and says, ""Here is your au jus"".  1) I asked if customers of The Cheesecake Factory are to dip their Beef Pit Dip sandwich into this, she said yes. 2) I asked her why I couldn't have a small soup container with the au jus broth or french onion broth, she shrugged. 3) I asked her if this was the same broth, she said yes.  4) I asked her why the liquid was cold to the touch, she shrugged. Excited to receive my sandwich, I saw I was missing an integral part. When I contacted the establishment about this they said to fight for a refund; I offered to just pickup some au jus instead, which they agreed to. When I got to the location, I was told to wait 20-25 min and was studied by managers. When I received what I hoped was my au jus, it was a small 1-2oz container of cold brown liquid. I left the brown liquid with the waitress and returned to my dry ruined order 40 minutes later. Unfortunately, I have experienced better from The Cheesecake Factory.

I understand that they close at 11pm I didn't think coming In at 9:45pm would upset them . The server Luis m. Wasnt so happy with us at all throughout the whole entire night . I ordered the tomato basil pasta which was good and a good portion my friend ordered the enchiladas which was okay wasn't that great. After dinner we ordered 5 desserts To go 2 tiramisu cales 1 key lime pie 1 mango key lime and a salted caramel cheesecake. Although the server only came back with all but the salted caramel which I just let it go cause while waiting for the check I managed to finish the mango key lime pie (couldn't resist). The tiramisu cakes didn't look at all appealing therefore I returned it requesting for one that would look edible like the other desserts I got. And keep in mind I have ordered the tiramisu dessert before. He returned it back with the same exact cakes and this time the cakes were worst and it was just a mess in the box. So I walked over and ask politely to take it off my bill I didn't expect him to holler over to the pastry workers to point out Im the one who decline to his cake.

Their food is delicious, affordable for the type of restaurant, and there is such a wide range of food options to choose from! In my opinion this is the perfect place for a romantic date night or a celebratory birthday dinner with friends and family!  I mean, you always start off on a good note here when the waiter brings you the delicious soft warm bread that you cannot help but indulge in. To be honest, I go through about 3 of those baskets before my meal even gets to me.  In regards to dishes, you really can't go wrong with any order here but just in case you'd like recommendations, my favorites include: the factory burrito grande and the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. I recently had the egg roll sampler appetizer for the first time and that was delicious too! Ps if you get the factory burrito grande prepare to come VERY HUNGRY! Or you can also take it home and eat it for the next 2 meals. A lot of the dishes are pretty big and I almost always take home leftovers Now comes dessert, because that's obviously the main reason everyone comes here!!! Bring on the cheesecake!!! My favorites are the s'mores cheesecake, the salted caramel cheesecake, and the red velvet one! But truthfully, you really can't go wrong with any of them. Especially not on national cheesecake day when they are half off!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=100
Monica B.,"Sacramento, CA",6,10,20,1.0,2/5/2017,"Here is a breakdown of my to go order experience during a Saturday night. 10:07 PM Called in to make a pick up order. I was transferred and put on hold to make an order after a 2 minute wait. The order taker asked what I wanted, my name, and gave me the price to pay. I got the Cuban sandwich order with fries. The representative didn't tell me how long it's going to be or ask for my phone number to let me know it is done. 10:17 PM Arrived in the parking lot and it wasn't busy since there were a few spots open along the restaurant. Expecting to get the meal within a few minutes. 10:18 Paid for the food at the to-go/cheesecake display area. While waiting we noticed other people were waiting for the cashier to help them out. They must have been at the cashier's for at least 5 minutes without being helped. We also noticed that it wasn't as busy as it normally is since their hallway wait area was not packed and there were empty tables. 10:55 PM Got the TAKE-OUT Cuban sandwich. Way too long of a wait time. 10:56 PM I noticed the fries and sandwich were lukewarm. Didn't even bother to ask for hot food because the wait time was not worth it. 11:10 PM Got home and ate the meal. The sandwich was good because of the great quality meats they had and the fresh bread, but again lukewarm. Not worth the wait. There were about 20 fries in the bag and they were comparable to Burger King's. Not worth the extra dollars for the Cheese Cake Factory name attached. Some of the fries had a frozen fry taste to it as well. I suggest to not get fries or if anything, order them extra crispy to make it palatable. Or maybe even get the side salad instead of fries. In general, I would give them 0 stars and not come back due to the approximate 48 minute wait time for a TAKE OUT order and my meal being under par for having to wait during a time when the restaurant isn't that busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=100
Lisa X.,"Sacramento, CA",0,30,,4.0,2/10/2017,"0 STAR FOR THE FOOD! I have ordered their food before and I'm not impressed by it. It's a little too expensive for the bland taste it can be. The bread they serve first while we all wait for our order is so good though! I only take a small bite... Their utensils sometimes have dry foods from before stuck on it and that's quite disgusting to me. Ever since this experience, I've been coming here once every 6 months or once a year, but it's slowly becoming none a year. And I don't order their food anymore. Just the cheesecake cause who doesn't love cheesecake? :) 4 STARS FOR THE CHEESECAKE THOUGH! I rarely come here, but when I do, it's usually with my sisters. I'm mainly here for the variety of cheesecake that they have. It's hard to choose what to eat since they all sound and look delicious.

I normally lick the plate clean,  but today I left a few morsels on my plate only because I two fisted the bread and butter before dinner. Not to mention a glass of passion iced tea to expand the dough in my belly. Appetizers and munching bread will always ruin your dinner. But I never learn... Oh well.

Ginny L.,"South San Francisco, CA",161,6,2,1.0,6/12/2017,"I've always remembered Cheesecake Factory for their good food and good customer service but for my experience, this one had neither.  First off, our waiter was kinda cold if I may say. He asked what drinks he could get for us and looked quite impatient while my boyfriend was looking through the menu since we had just sat down. He ended up just getting a water since he noticed that the waiter looked irritated. He then came back and mumbled ""can I start you guys off with some bread and butter?"" I could barely hear what he said and my boyfriend couldn't hear at all and it's not like it was extra loud in there.  Food wise, my boyfriend got the steak Diane and said it was pretty good. I got what I always get: Louisiana chicken pasta. However, mine didn't have much flavor and it was really oily. At other locations, they always come with the block of Parmesan cheese right when they bring me my plate of pasta but this one didn't. It didn't bother me much until it took me over 5 mins to flag down a waiter/waitress for some cheese (we were sitting in an area where waiters and waitresses were coming and going so 5 mins was kinda pushing it). Food did come fast but our appetizer came like 10 mins after our main courses and what we had ordered was literally grilled cheese with a piece a bacon so idk why it took so long lol.  As for service the rest of the night, we never saw our waiter again. It wasn't even him who brought us our food. No one came by to ask how we were doing. We had to wait over 20 mins just to ask for boxes for our food and for the check. However, the lady who did help us at the end with the boxes and check seemed pretty friendly and was the type of customer service I was used to seeing at a Cheesecake Factory.  We tipped really little (didn't even want to tip tbh) and that's coming from people who always tip, even at little snack and drink places.  Tldr; love Cheesecake Factory, just not this one.

In the meantime, we enjoyed some drinks at the bar. I ordered the passion fruit margarita, it was tasty but really sweet. For $13 a cocktail, I would hope for more alcohol.  After finally being seated, the service was okay. There was long periods of time where our server was not to be found. We asked for bread 3 times and finally received a refill. This was also after our good has arrived. I ordered the steak Diane, it was okay. I ask for a medium rare the temperature on the steak was all different. Since some pieces were thicker than others so some pieces were well done, some pieces of medium rare. We spent $120 between for our 2 person tab for drinks, entrees and cheese cheesecake to take home. Overpriced for mediocre food and service.

My favorite item on the menu is the Divinci pasta. I order it with angel hair noodles. We also like the buffalo blasts and the chicken marsala. And of course the cheesecake is amazing!

Emerald M.,"Sacramento, CA",8,2,,1.0,11/3/2017,"Doesn't even deserve one star. Honestly at first I wasn't even that mad. Basically online order was messed up and I thought I would just call and they would offer to remake it and I could go pick it up for dinner after work. However what upset me was the way this was handled - so unprofessional and lazy. This WAS a door dash order so I get that the money is handled through Door Dash- fine. You would think though, that since CHEESECAKE FACTORY'S employee is the one who royally messed up the salad, they would take responsibility. But no. Door dash is responsible for the delivery and they did great - arrived early, no hassle... The restaurant is supposed to know how to make their own food. I ordered The Vegan Cobb salad and not only did it have CHEESE (hello...not vegan) but it had two other items it was NOT supposed to have. Also, it was MISSING 5 major items which made up the bulk of the salad -  almonds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, garbanzo beans, and avocado were all missing. When I called and spoke with the hostess she was really nice but then gave me to the manager, Dandy. Dandy was super inflexible, took no responsibility, did not apologize or offer any compensation just kept saying I had to go through door dash. I was *not asking him to give me my money back* all I wanted was for it to be remade. When I asked him for his name he hung up on me. I called back and called him out on it. He denied it. I finally got his name and the name of his manager - gave me the CEO of Cheesecake Factory - David Overton... don't tell me you don't have a manager besides the CEO geez.

Jean S.,"Sacramento, CA",203,245,1453,4.0,8/1/2015,"Our service was top notch! I came here on National Cheesecake Day (7/30) and was seated outside. Our server, Costas, was super friendly, helpful, patient, and had an all-around genuine and positive attitude. The service he provided was fantastic, definitely one of the best service experiences I've had.  The Cheesecake Factory now has a new superfoods menu! Perfect, since healthy eating has been making trends lately and people are more conscious of the foods they are eating. I ordered the almond-crusted salmon salad - pan seared salmon over a salad of kale, brussel sprouts, arugula, avocado, quinoa, cranberries, radishes, and vinaigrette dressing. The salmon was very tender and delicious. The kitchen forget to include the avocado, but our server brought some on the side. Apparently the new menu has only been out for a week so the kitchen was not super familiar with it yet.  I guess after eating a super good food, it's time to eat the super bad food...yet also super good in its own way. The Oreo cheesecake...aka Oreo Dream Extreme is my favorite and I just cannot order any other! Although many other flavors taste good, no other can match the rich, decadent, awesomeness of the Oreo cheesecake. I've been to Cheesecake Factory at least 3 times this year and probably 5 times within the last couple years and each time I've ordered the Oreo cheesecake. I've have tried the tiramisu, s'mores, and chocolate cheesecake, which are all good, but still love the Oreo best. In previous visits, I've had the herb crusted salmon, chicken marsala pasta, and a cheeseburger. The herb salmon was really tender and perfect, the chicken marsala pasta was flavorful and delicious, but the burger was not good. The burger was dry and plain tasting, definitely not their specialty. Also on the negative side, the prices are a tad bit high and there can be a long wait for a table.

One time I came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday and they had a great experience, we all ordered pasta dishes too. For drinks, I tried the J.W. Pink Lemonade and it was okay. For dessert, we got the tiramisu and it was my first time eating it. Our server forgot my dad's cappucino, so I had to remind her, and she didn't check up on us as much as she could have, but I understand since I'm also a server at a busy restaurant. The portions are absolutely huge, so the prices are reasonable. Unfortunately, I don't really like cheesecake (definitely I'm in the minority here), but I come here for the pasta dishes and yummy appetizers.  I recently came here about a week ago with my best friend (after an exhausting adventure of finding Christmas gifts) and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. When we were seated, we were immediately greeted by our server and ordered drinks. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my best friend got another pasta dish, but I forgot what it was. We both enjoyed our dishes and our server came by regularly to refill our drinks and check up on us and our meal. However, midway through our dining experience, our server just disappeared and was nowhere to be found, but that's okay, because another server noticed or either took over, and took good care of my best friend and I whenever we needed anything like drink refills or boxes and the check.

My only complaint is my husband order steak and   took way too long for us to recieve our order.they came and let us know they over cooked his steak and gave him a complementary clam chowder.which had a great   complaint is this after waiting 50 min for our food he got his plate,his steak was so small and thin that it was disappointing.

Romeo S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,1,1.0,12/6/2017,"Let me start off by stating that I love this place and my review is based on an experience we recently had. I must state that I do work in the same complex as these guys so I am more favorable of my opinions towards this place, but not this time. However, We see the same security walk and drive by daily. We park behind the green lines everyday. So if the server who helped us had come into our store, knowing he worked closed by, we would ensure his experience was nothing less than exceptional. This server had a condescending demeanor about him. He did not come by for a while and when we waived him down we had to practically beg for more water. In doing so, he rolled his eyes, walked away and returned with a slam on our table with more water. I am so perplexed to how he is in customer service. No one should be treated as if they were less than a human, especially not in a professional environment. Our horrific experience has tainted our impression on this once great location which has now forced us to do our monthly meetings at another restaurant in the complex. So who was responsible for this horrendous behavior that it has forced me to write such a review? The demonic servers name is Luis M. And if you are punished by receiving him as your server, run and run fast. This review will go on TripAdvisor as well because no one visiting Sacramento needs to have a misconstrued impression of our great people who lives here as Luis is not from Sacramento but hell itself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=160

It does not really matter whether the main course is good or not when there is such a long wait. The good part is that while I was waiting one of the bus-boys smuggled stuffed cheese olives from the bar. He fed me olives as I was waiting and did not charge me so I guess he stole them. I felt bad about it so I tipped him $5 which also made my lunch significantly more expensive. The stuffed olives were fantastic! I'll come back next time I have more time for lunch, probably during my weekend. I may also come back another time if I am in a mood for sampling stuffed olives, but one thing is for sure, I am not coming back whenever I have to come back to work in less than an hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=160

However, they have a ""skinnylishes"" menu with PLENTY of options of low calorie cocktails, appetizers and main dishes.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. Yum. The cherry tomatoes were seasoned with a flavorful dressing and the chicken breast was grilled perfectly. I subbed for brown rice which can be hard to cook, but I couldn't stop dogging in! So I had to give into temptation and ordered a low carb cheesecake. Maybe it's in my head,but it's a tad less tasty than the regular original cheesecake. Just not as rich. Still hit the sweet tooth craving .  Our server mike was friendly, attentive and not to pesty. He placed my to-go order to find it to arrive as we were leaving which was a nice touch. One of the hosts that gave us the buzzer could have smiled and not seem like she hated life, but maybe it's a bad day for her lol. She quoted a 15min wait but it was closer to 10min.

So 20 minutes later again, I asked for a Bourbon & Honey. Better, but still pretty gross.  I ordered a Kobe mushroom burger and requested they add arugula, and a salad as my side. What I got? A kobe mushroom burger with no arugula but a lovely side salad consisting of only arugula... and ranch. My friend ordered a shrimp pasta that was 90% garlic, 8% pasta and 2% shrimp. It had to be sent back and exchanged for a classic burger which was so mediocre it should be Webster's default picture for the word in the dictionary.

I love Cheesecake Factory, I am never disappointed when I get food from here but last night it was just awful. I order take-out for the first time which was a BIG mistake. First let me say that I was so happy to order from here because I found a old $25 Cheesecake Factory gift card and I was excited to use it because I didn't have to cook dinner. When I called in, I was put on hold for 15 minutes. Being put on hold for that long, I was pissed my mood was ruined. Then finally they took me off hold and apologized and everything, it was fine. I ordered and stuff and I arrived at the restaurant. Getting my food was fine, I did the curbside pickup, they didn't take too long and the waiter was very nice. Then when I got home, I was highly disappointed. My favorite pasta that I always get (Pasta da Vinci), it was just plain awful. There was literally no sauce, it tasted old, dry and it looked like they literally just microwaved it and put it in a take out box. And worst of it all the pasta wasn't even cooked, it was way undercooked and it was super cold! The bread that came with it tasted old and it was very cold. I literally live 5-10 minutes away, it shouldn't have been so cold. I tipped the waiter $8 just to get this piece of crap! I love Cheesecake Factory, it's one of my favorite places to get pasta, but I'm never ordering take out ever again. Seems like they don't care for take out orders and gives us whatever is old. They should have a person that is just for phone call take out orders so they're not distracted doing other things. Maybe it was a busy night, that's why I was put on hold for a while, which I understand  but the food was just plain disgusting and not Cheesecake Factory material.

Zaheem B.,"Elk Grove, CA",104,204,179,4.0,3/11/2016,"Where to start.. well I will admit this is probably my top chain restaurant! I think it's the variety that does it for me, they do several things well. My go to appetizer is the buffalo blast, Its the perfect mix of fried, chicken, spice, and cheese. Its their take on a buffalo wing and I am in love with it! This was also the first place I ever had fried mac n cheese, and till this day it is my favorite.  For dinner I also have several items I enjoy: kobe burger, cajun pasta, chicken madeira, farfale pasta, and the hibachi steak. During last nights visit I had the kobe burger and it was cooked perfectly, but the fries it came with tasted mediocre at best. I enjoyed a 22oz. Stela with the burger, which was the perfect mix to a long day at work. Thankfully I had a little room in the tank and ordered a chocolate cheesecake. The cake was fresh tasting and did not taste like a store bought cheesecake.  The only reason I can't give this place 5-stars is due to the spotty service. Unfortunately it is never consistent. I have had decent service, but on several occasions I have had poor service. I don't know why but the servers forget about you and aren't prompt majority of the times with requests (bread, extra sauce, utensils). On a side note I would also ask for the brightness of the lights to be slightly brighter, but I get the whole idea behind the ambiance factor, but at times I have to bring my face down to my plate in order to see specific ingredients in my food (First world problems).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=180

As with any Cheesecake Factory, busy, but not overly so that their service and timing of entrees leaving the kitchen would be delayed in such a way that would be noticeable. Our server took his time getting our drink order, which he got wrong despite bringing an alcoholic beverage to our table prior to checking our ID.  Our complimentary bread basket was only brought to our table after our server noticed he had brought the two adjacent tables theirs. Once our orders were taken, the wait seemed normal. Our appetizer came about 5-7 minutes after. However, our entrees took an additional 45 minutes to come out. A simple order of an omelette breakfast plate, and a Louisiana chicken pasta dinner.  Our server only checking in after about 15 minutes of our adjacent tables receiving their entrees. Who mind you, were 5-10 minutes later in arrival than us. Our server then gave us the update that the kitchen ""just got smacked"" and our orders were coming. Was that before or after our adjacent tables got their orders?  Once our entrees arrived it was immediately noticeable that the Louisiana chicken pasta had been sitting out for quite some time. The pasta was extremely rubbery, the chicken dry, and sauce had come down to a temperature only slightly above the room's.  Overall, surprisingly dissatisfied at the service.

Our server, Nicholas, was very friendly and personable. He even stepped into the kitchen to make my friend's dessert when the chefs were swamped!

Jennifer G.,"Wahiawa, HI",157,22,6,1.0,4/16/2017,Food was ok.... service was horrible. Took forever to get our order taken and to get our check was another 10 mins. She asked if we wanted dessert and we said no and she walked away. So we sat for 10 mins waiting for our check. She sure did give all her other tables great service. Not throwing the race card out or that we had kids with us. But I have read about why waiters/waitress treat people a certain way. But my omelet was pretty good.

April W.,"Modesto, CA",0,15,7,3.0,6/10/2017,"We usually eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Roseville but we were at the Arden Fair mall so we stopped in here. The server was nice but the service was slow. It took quite a while to get our entrees. I ordered the egg roll sampler and two of my egg rolls were so deep fried they weren't even edible. They literally disintegrated to crumbs when I picked them up. We ate at night, around 9 o clock and it is SO dark in there. I like to see what I'm eating but they keep the lights way too dim.

My friend also left all her medication on the table in a pill container and forgot it..the staff put it in a safe until she could come back and get it. I work in a restaurant and actually met my friend because she was my customer.

Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398,3.0,12/6/2015,"I occasionally come here with my lady who's a big fan of this place. When we're hungry, we'll literally drive about an hour to Sacramento just to come here. Imagine driving about an hour out of town only to be met with a 20-40 minute waiting list. I jokingly tell her lets go to Cheesecake Factory when I'm not even hungry. It has gotten to a point where I know in about an hour and a half later before we even get inside and get seated and I know we'll both be hungry at that point. You really have to pick the right days to come in. Clearly Friday nights and Saturdays are going to be busy. Expect a bit of a wait.  Onto the food. This place has so many dishes on the menu it's incredible. If you aren't feeling a burger and fries, they have pizza. If you aren't wanting pizza they have mexican food. If you don't want mexican food they have (list goes on and on here). Dead serious here. The menu can accommodate anyone's pallet. I think the issue is obvious here. With so many dishes on the menu, how do the cooks hone in and specialize on any dishes? From my experience and hearing the opinions of others, they really haven't. The food is certainly average at best. The portion sizes aren't consistent each time I visit.  There have been times where you could tell your food was finished along time ago, but with the amount of tables your waiter or waitress is balancing, they're getting it out to you a few minutes later. This may not necessarily be the truth because this place has staff moving from the kitchen to tables, but it's been too many occasions now where the only thing somewhat warm on my plate is the orange chicken. Imagine being hungry for a couple of hours now, having traveled 48 miles only to be told there's a few people in front of you we'll need you to wait a bit, and then you're served average tasting semi-warm food. This has only been my luck here, as my girl's food always appears to actually be steaming hot.  What I feel this place has going for it is the interior and obviously the cheesecake. Their cheesecake is to die for! If your meal is mediocre, end it with a cheesecake and you'll end up leaving feeling like you at least ate something tasted great. I've yet to comment on the general staff here. They're all very busy (at least the times I've been in). You never just see the staff sitting around and relaxing. They are always moving table to table, and going in and out of the kitchen. I would absolutely love to catch this place on a day and time where they aren't that busy to try to gauge the food and wait time on an average day, but I can't make it out to this location during that day/time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=200
Kyle C.,"Sacramento, CA",384,57,25,4.0,10/23/2016,"Cheesecake is kinda basic, but I can't get enough of this place. I can't compare it to a Mulvaneys or a Biba, but any place that I crave and eat at 2-3 times per month gets 4 stars in my book.  Notes for improvement: - the drive-up process takes a long time.

These little boneless wings are spicy, crispy, and tasty.  Also I orders the spicy crispy chicken sandwich w/ chipotle sauce. The ambience is phenomenal, and the portions are huge. I split both dishes with my date and we still had food to take home. We were both extremely full and satisfied.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the service was a bit slow.

This time there was a hair in our food and the waiter got irritated that we said something..our cheesecake was like falling over which of course it still tasted yummy as usual but I feel like presentation is kinda part too. It was super busy people kept bumping into U.S. While we were waiting and we were sat at a tiny 2 top where our conversations were overlapping with the tables on each side of us so we couldn't have any hard core convo.

This was because it was nearby and we did have a gift card burning a hole in my wallet. I'm pretty aware they usually open at 1100 AM. Well on Sundays it's 1000 AM. Lucky for us there was no wait and we requested to sit out on the patio. Both my hubby and I thought this was an awesome choice as we like to eat outside and when it's not crazy busy!!! Yes! Our waiter JT was very laid back but attentive as he came back to refill our drinks without us asking. I chose to eat healthy and had skinnylicious salmon. We did receive wheat and sourdough bread. Both were delish as well as my entree of salmon and veggies that consisted of asparagus spears, chopped, crunchy carrots and my fave green beans! All in all everything was yummy and really no complaints! If you haven't ever eaten at Cheesecake Factory their menu is like a book! We have been here several times although it's probably been over five years I think! They even had a special SkinnyLicious menu designed for those who wish to eat an entree lower in calories but yet have delicious tasting meal. Both my hubby and I ordered from this menu and it was amazing! I actually chose not to have dessert here as I had something else in mind!

We must have driven by this place a million times!  My wife and I just happen to be in the area after checking out a food fair at a local Jewish Temple down the street. Coming all the way from Elk Grove, we didn't want to go home right away. The Cheesecake Factory sounded like the perfect place to have breakfast or brunch on this Sunday morning.  We had gotten there around 10:30 this morning. As you enter the restaurant, you'll find comfortable bench seating on your right, and a case full of tempting cheesecakes and desserts on your left. They also have a full service bar. Coming this early in the morning, we were able to find close parking as well as not having to wait to be seated. This place can accommodate a large number of customers. There were tons of tables and chairs and also a large number of booths. A perfect place to bring the family to wine and dine. This was a perfect morning to dine outside. They have a huge outdoor dining area! There must be at least 25 tables out there. They offer so many different items on their menu that the menu comes in a little book. There seems to be something for everyone! Starting with appetizers and salads, pizzas, hamburgers, sandwiches, soups, pasta, fish and seafood, steaks and chops. They also serve eggs and omelettes all day long, and Sunday Brunch until 2:00 pm. It was nice to know that they also offer a large number of Vegan Entrees! Today I ordered out of their ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" Menu. I had their ""Sausage and Ricotta"" baked flatbread.(Sausage and Ricotta Cheese with Fontina, Parmesan and Romano Cheese and Herbs). ""Only 490 Calories! "" The flatbread came out ""Hot"". The crust was just the right thickness. Not to thin but yet not to thick. Does that make any sense ? Oh well! This was one of the best tasting flatbread I had in a while.  My wife also ordered out of their ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" Menu. She  had their grilled salmon with steamed asparagus, carrots, and her favorite green beans. The size of the salmon was not small by no means. I would say it was a 4 to 5 oz piece. Cooked perfectly. The vegetables were cooked just the way she likes. Not over cooked, but still on the crunchy side. All of this under 590 calories ! You got to be kidding! The service today was fantastic. Our waiter JT was  very attentive and very professional. He took our order promptly and made sure our glasses were never empty! I mentioned to my wife how impressed I was with JTs service . We had to pass on dessert today. But we'll make sure we leave room for dessert the next time we come.  We had a wonderful time today! And will surely be back soon!

I told him I was really frustrated because it had been an hour since I called in my ordered and I was originally told it would be about 20 minutes. I told him I had been waiting in my car for 40 minutes and have called 3 times to let them know I was there for my order. The server was baffled that I had called 3 times and proceeded to tell me that they JUST NOW told him we were there to pick up our order. He told me he would go get a manager to speak to me. A few minutes later he came back out with our food and a manager. I explained my frustration about the situation and asked her if my food had been sitting in there the whole time. Neither the manager or the server knew how long our food was sitting out from. I told her that we had ordered fish N chips and that is not something that should be sitting out for a period of time if that was the case. She said she was going to take care of our charges and said I have your food here now for you. We really just wanted our food and wanted to get home. The worst part is that when we got home and pulled the food out nothing was edible. The fries were cold and hard as rocks, his fish was soggy and cold, my chicken sandwich was hard and cold. This told me that our food sat out for an extended period of time, yet the manager still gave it to us. This was all the way around unacceptable! I much rather have paid for my meal and gotten edible food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=120

But let me add, I've been to Cheesecake Factory many times and there wasn't a time I was ever dissatisfied. Food is always good especially the freshly baked wheat bread. YUMMY!!!!!! The restaurant is big and spacious. You can eat out in the patio. The restaurant is good for kids. It can get a bit loud; therefore I wouldn't come here for a nice quiet romantic dinner.  Today lunch was fantastic. I was completely satisfied with my visit. Our waitress was Kathy. She was friendly and fast. She refilled our water and bread in a timely manner.  I ordered the Salmon Genovese (lunch portion) and oh my gosh, it was superb. The sauce wasn't to heavy. It help add a little flavor to the salmon. The baked artichoke and sun dried tomatoes made the dish even more delicious. You have to try this dish. I already texted my gfs recommending them to order this dish at their next visit.  ....

I think it's almost everyone's favorite. We did ask for warm bread - like ones right out of the oven, but we didn't get any. Not like that at least.  We ended up sharing the crab cake appetizer. There was 3 crab cakes but for 4 of us. We shared which is nice. I ended up getting the salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. It's always a delicious dish and I really enjoy it. The grilled salmon and broccoli made me feel like I wasn't gorging myself on a million calories even if I was.  We ended up sharing the salted caramel cheesecake for dessert.

Dinner was fine, as in no hiccups or ruined meals, but the food was just okay.  We were in town for a conference... me from the Bay Area, mom from 3 hours up North, & my sister who's local-ish.  I had the Almond Crusted Salmon over Kale Salad which was missing the salad dressing--  no biggie, didn't need the calories anyway.  My mom had the Skinnylicious Enchiladas Plate-- not sure why she would order Mexican food here, but she said it was okay.  My sister had the Avacado Egg Rolls--  she didn't finish them so I can only assume they weren't ""the best she ever had.""  I tasted a piece & thought they were good.  Our server was really nice.  Overall, dinner was 3 stars, pretty average chain-restaurant experience.   As we were leaving, I decided to order 3 slices of cheesecake to-go.  We got to our hotel room looking forward to tasting them, but unfortunately THEY WERE FROZEN!!  Like biting into ice cream FROZEN!  Not sure why they didn't just tell us, hey these are frozen so wait a bit to eat them.  No one said a word!  I mean, had I ordered this to our table, I'm sure they would have brought me a thawed piece of cheesecake, omg!!   Anyway, after paying $8 per slice, we had to put them in the hotel  room fridge until morning... then we had to checkout & be at day 2 of the conference from 7am - noon...  yeah, didn't really get to enjoy that $25 + tip of cheesecake!  So I decided to call a mgr to let them know about the cheesecake mishap...   I spoke with Diana...  she claimed to be the mgr.  She listened & explained ""see what had happened was...""  yada yada, someone dropped the ball.  She agreed that we shouldn't have been served frozen cheesecake  (""deeply chilled"" as she called it).  She concluded with an apology & a thank you for coming in & thanks for bringing it our attention so that next time--- uuhh, NO hun, there will not be a next time since you clearly do not value or respect your customers.  I wasn't looking for a freebie; I was hoping she would be interested in rectifying the wrong.  For now, I refuse to waste my time, energy, or finances on *hoping* for a better outcome next time...  especially after basically thanking me for throwing $30 of your cheesecake into the conference hall trashcan, haha!  Sorry, but no.  If this is any indication of her mgmt style, then I understand how we were served frozen cheesecake.  Too bad I didn't stop by after the conference to return the ruined cheesecake!  Guess Diana would have preferred that I FURTHER inconvenience myself by driving out of my way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=240

My friends also ordered and shared the calamari ($11.95) and onion rings (not sure of the price), which were both fried perfectly.  For my entree, I had the herb crusted salmon filet, which was served with asparagus and mashed potatoes on top of a cream lemon sauce. It was very light and tasty; I enjoyed it thoroughly. My group seemed to be content with their meals as well. And of course we had to order cheesecake! We ordered: white chocolate caramel macadamia nut, the anniversary chocolate, and the strawberry. The best one was the strawberry, but I like plain flavors lol. The white chocolate caramel was too sweet. As soon as we scraped the parts of the cake that had chunks of caramel, however, it was more palatable for me. The chocolate was just okay for me -- very chocolate-ly, so it would be perfect for chocolate lovers.

If you want to overeat on some ""meh"" food but don't have the patience for waiting for a table at Olive Garden, come here.  However, it IS possible to eat a normal portion and not waddle away...you just have to order an appetizer as your main course. The appetizers here are the size of a large-ish normal meal. The only downside is at you have to endure the waitress treating you like a total cheapskate. I'm not a cheapskate, lady, I just don't want to be eating the same leftovers for a week.  The cheesecake itself is ok, but not really great in terms of flavor. They insist on offering about 40 varieties of EVERY category (from salad to pasta to dessert) but they don't really do anything particularly well.  They literally have so many entrees available that I don't remember any of them clearly, so if a friend suggests we go to Cheesecake Factory, I think ""yeah, I guess they're ok..""

So damn good. The sauce they come with is delicious. Fried macaroni and cheese balls. I know,  I know.  It sounds like a heart attack on a plate.  My mouth has never loved something so much.  Every friend I've brought to cheesecake has tried them and you can watch the smile come across their face as the taste hits them.  General concensus : ""damn!"" Served on some marinara,  too good to be true.  Lunch / Dinner: Herb crusted salmon. Freaking delicioisness.  Comes atop some creamy, lemony sauce that's out of this world, with asparagus and mashed potatoes. I always mean to ask for extra sauce but I never remember.  Put that stuff on everything...it's good! Their soups change daily so when you hear the server say ""baked potato soup"" you say ""yes please!"" Creamy, cheesy, bacony...seriously incredible. Drink: Asian pear martini!! It's made with real pear puree so you'll get the yummy graininess of eating a fresh pear. My man gets them too because they're just that damn good. Cheesecake: all of them.  My personal faves are white chocolate raspberry, peanut butter cup, and the sinfully rich Godiva chocolate that comes with fresh whipped cream and a square of Godiva dark chocolate on top. Get it with cofee. Or if you're feeling fun, Irish coffee. I'm usually feeling fun!  If you're too full after the meal to eat cheesecake, get a slice to-go.

Rebecca A.,"Elk Grove, CA",66,81,22,3.0,7/30/2016,"Came here tonight for the first time with my boyfriend. We napped after work and woke up at 8pm hungry. We decided to use our gift card we got for here and have a late dinner.  Upon arrival at 9:20pm there wasn't a lot of parking open so we immediately prepared ourselves for a long wait. It was about 15-20 minutes though which is normal.  The waiting area and the cheesecake to go counter is right next to each other right as you enter, so the entrance is a cluster of people.  Once we got seated we immediately met our waitress who greeted us with hot bread and butter. She took our order of drinks: 2 waters and 1 Sierra Nevada(OMG IT WAS $9 ALMOST!!!) My water tasted really weird, almost like the taste of licking your finger after using nail polish remover. My boyfriends water was fine so I just didn't drink mine. I think it may have been something on the cup, maybe some soap residue making it taste a little strange. My boyfriend was ever so stoked to see the eggs and omelets are served all day! He's a huge breakfast foodie. He got a bacon ham and cheese omelet with English muffins and fried potatoes. He cut into his omelet and cheese, small bacon slices, and cubed ham just oozed out of it, it looked so good! He loved his food and was happy to have leftovers to heat up for breakfast. I got the cheese pizza. I have to say when it comes to pizza I don't care about anything, I'll eat whenever/where ever with any type of crust or cheese. When I bit into this pizza though I immediately got a smokey flavor almost like it was grilled? But the cheese had a very very fake taste. There were herbs like oregano and garlic in the cheese as well but it still couldn't mask the fake cheese flavor. Almost tasted like those off brand $1 cheese pizzas from the freezer aisle. It wasn't terrible but I didn't expect such a fake flavor from this restaurant. I asked for ranch to help change the flavor but the ranch was super sweet tasting at first and then ended tasting like garlic! I wasn't very impressed with my meal! Our waitress told us the cheesecake slices were half off tonight so we both got a slice! I of course being the caramel lover that I am got the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and my boyfriend being the Oreo fanatic he is got the Oreo Cheesecake!  Half off was nice and super unexpected!  My Salted Caramel Cheesecake slice tasted like the Ben and Jerrys Caramel Core ice cream!!! So good. A thick layer of caramel just coats the entire slice. Highly recommend if you love caramel! :) My boyfriends Oreo Cheesecake Slice was amazing. I'm not a huge chocolate person but he is and he was very impressed! Overall, not a bad experience for it being my first time! It was pleasurable, however I don't think I would make plans to eat here in the future, and in glad my meal was paid for with a gift card and not my own money, especially after a $9 beer..

He let us know the specials and brought us out drinks quickly. My daughter has a really tough day and he made her smile and laugh every time he came to check on us.  Bravo Jared!

I ordered a root beer and after drinking it think it tasted funny, I told the waitress that the drink was flat having no carbon in it. Thankfully she came back with a new drink while they changed the drinks in the back for me.  I would come back again because of the great service they have.

The wait time was no problem they said 45 minutes so we went to Toysrus to waste some time, our table was done before that so we came back. We had a nice corner spot to accomidate our table of 9.  Service- Our server was so polite just a very nice person and so attentive and right on every point! We didn't have to wait for anything he was always right there, if he had to come back he would explain really quick that he would be back in one minute, he was very attentive to all his tables and let me tell you this place was packed wall to wall. Drinks- We ordered a few Shirly Temples and water and they came right away no wait time at all. Appetizer- We got the Fried Mozzarella. It came out nicely plated, golden brown, crispy, hot, cheese fully melted and served with Marinara Sauce. Very delicious! I want more just thinking about it. Food- I ordered the Grilled Chicken & Avacado Club. All their food was big portions so you won't be leaving there hungry. My Club Sandwich was the best I ever had. Nice juicy grilled chicken breast, bacon, lettuce, tomatoe and avacado on golden brown grilled bread. Oh so good I'm still snacking on the other half. You can have salad or fries I got the salad with blue cheese dressing.  Dessert- I got the cheese cake topped with cherries and whipped cream that was really good but I already knew it was going to be.  The restaraunt is gorgeous inside from wall decor, paintings on the ceilings and statues, seating area is very nice, the bar is huge and I like how they place the alcohol up the wall to almost the ceiling. I'm impressed I haven't been to a restaraunt in years where it was all around satisfying....  just amazing. Thank you to our waiter for the outstanding service and the chefs and cooks that took  such great pride in their cooking which is hard to find now days.

Nicole H.,"Temple City, CA",8,39,37,2.0,4/21/2016,"Being that this was the first time I had ever eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, our experience wasn't the best. We've all heard that the Cheesecake Factory is an excellent place to eat at and the food is super delicious. But my hubby and i's experience really tells a different story.  My hubby and I got to the restaurant at around dinner time, but we were seated rather quickly. We were given our complimentary bread and butter quickly, along with our drinks, which we decided to have just water.  Our waiter was really nice and quick at getting our orders down, without much deciding I decided to order the chicken bellagio while my husband decided to get the Kobe beef burger FIRST. The waiter left with our orders, but with some more deciding he decided to go with the fried mac and cheese burger (medium rare). He chased down the waiter and asked for a change, which our waiter did right away.  The wait for the food was sort of long, but we weren't upset because we had already expected the wait and we had our bread to munch on while we waited. My husbands food came out first, and then mine took a little while to come out after.  At first bite I wasn't too satisfied with the pasta, it was sort of dry and all stuck together, it didn't seem like it was fresh or that it was heated up all the way. My husband was also not satisfied with his burger, being super picky with his burgers, this one was cooked very well done, but he asked for it to be medium rare. We sent the burger back, but not the pasta because I'm less picky than he is.  The new burger was taking sort of long, but I think our waiter sensed that we were getting irritated because he offered us some soup. He also kept us updated on the burger and how much more we had to wait on it.  When his second burger finally came out though, it was perfect. Although on the negative side, we were both so full from the fries and soup and bread that we couldn't even finish our foods. I ended up eating only half of the portion that was on my plate. And my husband also ate just half of his burger. We ended up deciding to take it all to go, but I was displeased that our food wasn't boxed for us, and that we had to do it ourselves.  Overall our experience at the Cheesecake Factory was not such a pleasing one. Our food took forever to come, it wasn't fresh, we had to send one plate back, the wait was forever and in the end, we didn't even feel like trying some of their cheesecake. But if you guys ever do need somewhere fancy to take your family or friends, the Cheesecake Factory may be a good option, because I've heard that in Asia mostly, this placed is very well known. :^)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=260

Nhi T.,"San Jose, CA",190,37,23,2.0,4/16/2016,"My sibs and I love having an occasional dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. We don't come often but normally the service is good. Friendly people who do a nice job at serving and meeting our needs. I.  Last night, we went as a party of 8 around 920PM. 5 adults and 3 kids. Waited about 30 minutes for a table. Our server was a man named Timothy. We got seated and he took our drink orders as well as our food orders. Since we were a party of 8, our table was really long. Timothy stood on one end of the table trying to take my sister's order (who was sitting on the other end), and she was literally yelling over the background chatter of the restaurant. He finally walks over to that side of the table to take their orders. Shouldn't it be common sense to move to the other end so people aren't shouting across the table?  Anyway, Tried to order my usual dish (chicken chipotle pasta with their Louisiana chicken instead of the honey glazed chicken) but he insisted that they don't allow the substitution at all because it's ""two completely different dishes"". I gave up, I didn't want to waste breath over a chicken substitution so I just ordered it regular. But we requested for the 3 kids meals to be prepared first and brought out as soon as they were done.  When he brought out the drinks, one of the cups knocked over and spilled all over the table. Our waiter said he'd be back with a towel to wipe it off. 10mins pass and we made do with cleaning the spill with our own napkins. A table busser comes to clean the table NEXT to ours. Our waiter talks to the busser and they come over to our table to address the spill (that we cleaned ourselves 10mins ago). We told them we didn't need cleaning anymore. Fast forward to 10:30pm. No food in sight yet. No appetizers or kids food. Kids were getting sleepy waiting and munching on the complimentary bread.  10:40. Food finally arrives and all of the food came out at once. One of the kids ordered a cheese quesadilla but they made a chicken quesadilla. He was hungry so I didn't want to hassle our server in correcting the order since food took so long to come out in the first place. The food tasted good as it normally did. Our waiter never brought us paper napkins that we requested. And when it was time for the food boxing (past experiences, my waiters have 100% always brought the good back to be packed and brought it back to our table) he gave us 5 boxes to do it ourselves, and only one small bag. I don't know what the logic in that was.  Overall it was the worse service we've ever had here and we've been going occasionally for as long as I can remember. Really sad and I hope no one has a bad experience as this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=260

Place was clean and welcoming, but it was FREEZING inside. Just because it's hot outside doesn't mean it should be the exact opposite inside folks.  My margarita tasted like a big glass of overly sweetened lemonade. The tossed salad had several very bitter pieces of lettuce; I didn't even finish it. The main entree of herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes, and asparagus was very disappointing. To start with the presentation (not that I care so much about that) looked like the Facehugger alien from the movie ""Alien.""  A big piece of black salmon over the mashed potatoes with long, green asparagus sprouting out like tentacles. I told the server the presentation was BIZARRE.  Food-wise, the dish was not as hot as it should have been (Why won't restaurants learn that details count?!). The salmon was almost black from the herbs. The asparagus was too big (asparagus should be thin and slightly crunchy, not big and mushy). And they put some kind of cream sauce with it all (??). Why we'd need a cream sauce I don't know.  Entire bill with 15% tip (service was good), $46!!!! Yeah.

Table count:4. The positive. As I mentioned the wait was reasonable and the young man at front was very polite and courteous.  Our food consisted of a salad, the salmon dish and a shepherds pie for yours truly.  Each and every dish was impeccable, tasty and worth every bite.  I like to think that a good dish means less to take home.  We did not need any boxing today. The unfortunate:  I understand completely packed restaurants and hundreds of seated patrons with dozens more on the wings waiting patiently.  But table service was not what I had hoped at today at The Cheesecake Factory.  The water came out fine and in a few minutes,  we had to ask then wait over 10 minutes for the first batch of bread which has three loaves and was ok.  20 minutes later no follow up service and we had to ask for more bread which only brought 2 loaves and was more stale than a piece of croutons. The last positive was the drinks, pineapple Mojito's and typhoon punches.  Definitely hats off to the bartender.  Kind of made up for other aspects.   This is I think was a one off I generally have great experiences.  HAPPY DINING Yelpers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=260

So we stood there waiting for them to finish there conversation for an extra 3-4 mins. We were finally able to hand her our buzzard and were told to wait where we were. The hostess' talked among themselves for another few minutes so I ask the hostess are we going to be seated because we've been waiting an ongoing 7+ minutes? She says yes and then turns to other hostess to say some things about me. Clearly you looking at me and whispering shows your attitude towards me. We waited another 5 minutes before being seated. Mind you we've already been waiting 24 mins, get buzzed for a table and are still waiting an extra 10+ minutes to be seated. Don't buzz someone for a table and continue to seat other people that are buzzed after us and walk in after us. That's rude and since it's your policy of first come first serve for tables, why even seat other people before the ones who've been waiting the longest.   We also asked the hostess for a high chair as you can clearly see my child was not walking yet.

I'm not fond of the wheat bread. It was a bit sweet and hard. I ordered the sweet tamale as an appetizer, very delicious, but I think it works better without the salsa, sour cream, and avocado since it was sweet. My entree was the chicken madeira. It was tender, topped with asparagus and mushrooms, and the sauce was good. The chicken itself had no flavor. The mashed potatoes were my favorite part. My friend ordered the chicken teriyaki. NEVER order Asian dishes from a non-Asian restaurant. It was almost 20 dollars for a plate of hard white rice and mediocre chicken. The maraschino cherry garnish was definitely interesting to see on the plate.... All in all, not a very good place to eat.

I don't care what time of day it is...I'm ordering cheesecake... because it is mind blowingly delicious. Just 4 stars because, seriously, it's too expensive. But, then, so is crack - and this is so much better. (I really don't know that ...because I don't use crack.)  This place is always packed, but we usually get our cheesecake to go, which doesn't take too long. Get this...I almost always order plain cheesecake. No cookie,candy,frosting, etc. People, people... it doesn't need all of that...maybe some strawberries - or chocolate crust variation.

Ai M.,"Sacramento, CA",3,33,21,1.0,2/27/2017,"So, I normally do curbside pick up as its handy when I'm pregnant and ready to pop but still need to satisfy my cravings. I also normally give a tip but lately this restaurant's service is going down hill.  I called in advance and they said it will take 20 minutes to get the food ready. I gave them 35 minutes as I don't like waiting. Called told them I've arrived-gave them my car make which store I'm facing and that I have cash so please just bring out the food. This restaurant doesn't have a card reader  like other restaurants and even if you give them cash, they take your cash then goes back in to get your food--a long drawn out process that could be more efficient. Regardless, seven minutes waiting and still no food. I called and asked them what's up? The lady didn't even apologize, and said the food will come out and hung up on me. Then a guy manager (I'm guessing as he is wearing a dress shirt and tie) comes out after 13 minutes (from when I first called) and said I need to secure payment first before I can bring out the food--even though I had exact cash. I've been coming here every week and normally this doesn't happen--again long drawn out process. Gave him the money, went back in to get my food, after five minutes, he came back out again with my food--mind you now I just want to leave and who knows if they've now spit on my food as I was already annoyed that they didn't come out with my food. The manager started taking out the food from the bag to show me each food, I was afraid the food might fall. I asked to just hand me the food and I can look while he is in front of me. I wanted to check as two weeks prior they messed up and gave me crab bites when I ordered and was charged for crab cakes (diff between $13 or so dollars to $7 or so dollars if memory serves me right and yes when I brought this up, they didn't offer a refund or an apology). Nevertheless, this is my last time going to this location.  Poor service, long and drawn out, not at all efficient, crab cakes is cold as hell, the salmon on my kale salad also cold. Normally, it should still be hot but not this time. 18 minutes to bring out food--ridiculous. And if any one was wondering, there were times that when they take this long, I just went in to get my food--well guess what, its even ridiculous as they ignore you and help out others that are trying to buy in the bakery section. They don't know the meaning of first come, first serve. I guess they figure that it takes awhile to walk to the kitchen to get my food where the people who wants cheesecakes can be helped asap because they clear them out first before trying to get my food.

The dish has pesto angel hair pasta topped with a crispy chicken, arugula and prosciutto. The waiter was dumb and told us that the coupons for the free cheesecakes didn't work saying they have already been used. We were stumped cause it was our first time using it so we found her excuse to be stupid and asked for her to run the coupons again and it worked! She recommended me to get a cheesecake that I sorta did not like but whatever. I shall just stick to my originals, Fresh strawberry cheesecake. Can't go wrong with the originals. She recommended me the Raspberry cheesecake which was fine, but not the best.  I usually come here with the mindset that my meal will be roughly $20 after tip and tax.

Eric C.,"Carmichael, CA",396,183,1044,2.0,11/25/2015,"I really hate to give such a glorious looking place two stars, but in my experiences here -- this place just isn't ""all that!""  If you are just going for dessert, this place is an easy four stars!  Seriously, they do sweets up wonderfully and I have to give respect where respect is due.  That being said, let me tell the rest of the story like it is...      First of all, this place is beautiful inside and out.  When you walk inside you kind of expect to have an extra special experience.  It's always been clean during my experiences here and the staff is most often very friendly and prompt.  Those are the high marks.        The menu is way too big.  I think it is fantastic to have such a wide variety of food available to diners, but this menu takes way too long to browse through if you have no idea what you want to eat.  I am not sure if they have designed it that way for the customer to order appetizers while trying to decide on an entree, but if it is...  It's not cool.  Also, if you are dining in the evening, some of the dining rooms are extremely dark.  My eyesight isn't what it once used to be, so it is hard to read a bloated menu in the dark.      The food...  I can't remember everything I have eaten in the past, but I know nothing has blown my socks off enough to make me remember it.  Last night I tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (I would have taken a photo, but it was too dark in the dining room we were in).  When it got to the table it looked great, but there was no smell to it.  You should be able to smell good food when it is sitting in front of you.  The bowtie pasta was a little too molto al dente for me.  Not only that, there was very little flavor in the sauce.  The parmesan encrusted chicken was moist inside and crisp on the outside, but there was absolutely no seasoning in/on the chicken.  I ate about a fourth of the dish when I thought about drowning the rest in Sriracha.  By the time our waiter came by, I had already lost interest in the dish and had him take it away.  My girlfriend and her mother enjoyed their bacon-bacon burgers.  They also told me, after seeing I was not pleased, that I should try their nachos.  I have had their Mac-n-Cheese burger before and it is a decent burger, but it is nowhere near the goodness that should come with a $12 price tag; moreover, when I come to a place like this...  My first inclination is NOT to order a burger or nachos.  I can get a much better burger for half the price at The Habit (I'm not exaggerating either).  $17 for an overly-bland pasta dish is just unacceptable.  If you are going to run this place with a high end appearance, you should at least serve memorable food.        There is one thing I will remember about this place.  The reason why my girlfriend and her mom wanted to eat here last night was to pick up a Pumpkin Cheesecake for Thanksgiving.  When we saw that it was $52, we decided just to have dinner and skip the reason for showing up in the first place.  Ha!  I hate to hand out two star reviews, but from the handful of times I have been here, it is clear that The Cheesecake Factory NEEDS to step up it's game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=300

The sauce, though it could kill you calorie-wise, is super rich and very satisfying with bits of pancetta.

She didn't smile or make us feel comfortable to be there. I was so upset because I gave it a second shot when I really didn't want to.

It turned out she was training the other server so we were spoiled by a little extra attention between the two of them.  Cheesecake has an insanely large menu so it took us a few minutes to decide. We started with the Tuna Tartare and Beet & Goat Cheese - both of which were excellent!  I tried their veggie burger and she had the smokehouse burger. If you have ever had the veggie burger at Rutherford Grill, theirs is very similar. It's delicious! I can't say how my friends burger tasted but she practically licked her plate.  All in all, we had a very good lunch. I'm so impressed by how well they are able to execute such a large menu.

He finally came by and I pointed out that there were no eggs, and he said he'd get them for me right away. It again took quite awhile for the eggs to come and when they did, again delivered by a different runner, they were poached to the point of being hard boiled. I put them off to the side and did not eat them and while the server walked by a few times and glanced at our plates, he did not seem to notice that the eggs were cooked incorrectly or pause to check on us. When we got the bill I had been charged for an extra side of eggs.

I came around 12ish (and on the day of Easter), so it was pretty crowded. The wait was about 30-40mins. But the good thing is that it's right next to the mall so you can spend your time walking around instead of just sitting there. & they text you when it's time to be seated :)  Okay, enough with that. Let's talk about the food !! ~^___^~ FOOD~~~ 1) Firecracker Salmon --pretty pricey for the amount that you get. ($10.95 for 4 pieces) But delicious. Basically salmon wrapped with egg roll sheets and fried. The salmon inside each did not have a fishy aftertaste, and the sweet sauce at the bottom of the plate completes the overall taste. I don't know if they added the red cabbages just to make it look nice, but I do recommend eating it with the rolls. The cabbage gives that extra crunch that's needed. Plus, the sauce is all over it so it tastes great! 2) Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic --DELICIOUS. It had a smokey taste to it from the bacon bits and the caramelized onions. And the taste of the roasted garlic overwhelms the dish in a good way. The chicken that it comes with was very soft and not chewy at all.  I personally love garlic and onions so this entrée was purrrfect for me. AND who can so no to bacon? 3) Louisiana Chicken Pasta --ALSO DELCIOUS! This dish had a more tangy taste to it with a kick of spice. It tasted like I was in New Orleans! The red and yellow peppers complimented the spices that completed the dish.  Overall, it was a great experience. I'm sad I got so full from the appetizers and pastas because I didn't get to try any of the cheesecakes! & the place is called CHEESECAKE Factory -__-"" but oh wells.

For how surprisingly busy it was at 2pm, we were seated at a booth very quickly, but it only went downhill from there. Once our waiter took our orders, it was almost an hour of sitting there without ANY food before he came to tell us that the kitchen overcooked my boyfriend's burger and had to redo it. He offered us soup or salad while we were waiting, but didn't mention it if was complementary or not...so we declined. Once our food finally came, we practically inhaled it because we had been waiting so long. We were reluctant to stay longer, but the reason we had come in the first place was to redeem free cheesecake slices, so we ordered a slice of pineapple upside down cheesecake. Even that took a while to come, considering how the front cheesecake counter has slices on plates ready to go for the waiters. Once that plate was cleared, we waited for our check. And waited. Our waiter was nowhere in sight, not even at his other tables nearby. Finally, I flagged him down and asked for the check. After TWO hours at The Cheesecake Factory, when all we had wanted was a simple late lunch/linner, we were more than ready to leave. The saving grace of this experience was the cheesecake. The pineapple upside down cheesecake and the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake we ordered to-go were delicious.

Tabassum L.,"Sacramento, CA",4,66,,2.0,5/30/2016,"I have been coming here for years and have brought in different people with me to try this place out who in return have came back and brought other people with them to try it out.   My favorite has always been the  Four Cheese Pasta with a Side of Mashed Potatoes. In the past I have also tried the Salmon, about twice, and each time have gotten sick off of it which is weird because I'm fine with home cooked Salmon. I used to love the food here and the people but I feel like, slowly, not only has their staff changed but so has the food.  The past few times that I came in the food has tasted a little bland. I feel like coming in here now is a waste of money because I can make the same stuff @ home and have it taste much better.  Not only that, I haven't been very happy with service lately either. The last time I came in here was last year with my older sister and a friend. Our friend had asked the waiter what kind of virgin margarita he would offer and his response was whatever looks good to you, he never once asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks, he would pass by our table or act like he was coming towards it and instantly change directions, he took our friends glass and got her a refill without asking her if she wanted another refill,  when it was my turn to order he looked at me and nodded his head at me to order instead of using words like a normal person, we finally requested for another waiter and ended up getting a Complimentary Dessert out of it.

So we wait and eventually get a table. Our waitress was friendly. The menu is pretty big as it has everything from pizza to pasta and burgers. I decided on the stuffed mushrooms for a snack and my entree the pepperoni pizza. My Gf got a pasta dish that I can't quite remember the name. Everything was good that we ordered. Pizza was a bit on the thin side but they loaded it with lots of cheese :-)  oh and they bring out bread while you wait for your food. Overall a pleasant experience.

She apologized and then threw her co worker under the bus by saying I thought it was her table. Her tone was up beat at first. She continued to explain why she took so long that it was her day off but picked up this shift.  Then she finally asked us if we were ready to order we usually like to snack on some bread first but we just placed our order. The portions are pretty big so we like to share. My wife ordered appetizer wings as her entree and I got my usual chicken littles plate. She got coffee and I wanted water at the moment. I'm not sure if what we ordered made her upset or if she decided to not try giving us good service but after that her tone and attitude went down.  Too make my story short we noticed her being upbeat and cheerful with her other guest but with us it seemed she was over us. We weren't rude to her at all which in this case I would of been but my wife went over to the manager on duty and she came over and took care of the situation.  Diana was on it and was sorry we had a bad experience and ended up giving us a new waitress and a free cheesecake. I'm not sure if I got her name right but Rachel was friendly and made sure the rest of our meal and time there was pleasant.  The ironic thing about it was my wife noticed when we were waiting for our server to show up and greet us it was Rachel who told Cassandra that that couple (Us) is your table and has been waiting for you for awhile now and Cassandra rolled her eyes.

Well now I can brag to them that I finally did!  I decided to come to this place for my first time for my 22nd birthday dinner on a Friday night. 4 of my friends and I came here around 6:30pm (sad we missed the Happy Hour 4-6pm) and it was packed, but luckily we were able to get a booth in like 10-15 minutes.  I asked my friends what was good here and I read the reviews of this place and everyone talks about their cheesecake; specifically their Red Velvet cheesecake so I knew I had to get that for dessert.  Started off with the unlimited bread! I love love their brown bread (had a sweet taste to it) I ended up ordering the Avocado Eggrolls for appetizers and shared it with my friends; we all loved it! For my entree I got the Factory Combination (Steak and Salmon) and it was served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I really enjoyed the steak (marinated in a sauce with mushrooms too) and the mashed potatoes (I'm a big fan of mashed potatoes) and the salmon and asparagus was alright. Steak was the right texture, not too tough and the mashed potatoes were creamy. My friend recommended me to get the Factory Peach Bellini (not a strong drink but a very fruity/girly drink) and I enjoyed it! And of course for dessert, I had a Red Velvet Cheesecake and the staff sang me Happy Birthday as well. Everyone was right, their Red Velvet Cheesecake is the bomb!

Most of the previous visits involved birthdays and I don't remember having ever been neglected the slightest by any of the workers here.  Their servers are conversant, but without being too imposing. The restaurant is huge and they are quite efficient with their use of space from the entrance to the bar, from the dining area to the patio seating -- everything is carefully organized and seemingly spotless. It ultimately makes for a clean and comforting environment.  The food has consistently been satisfactory. I've tried their Fried Calamari appetizer. It's light, and excellent with the garlic dip and the cocktail sauce. The most recent visit I had their Loaded Tater Tots, which you have to be careful with because it comes out really hot; you don't want to burn your tongue and ruin your whole dining experience. Give it a couple minutes and then you can selfishly munch on these tiny flavorful tots. Fresh Grilled Salmon was what I got for my main entree. I was feeling seafood, so why not? It was cooked perfectly, and went well with the mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  Now for the REAL main entree ;) -- the S'mores Cheesecake!

Margaret L.,"San Ramon, CA",374,567,247,3.0,6/15/2014,"I love cheesecake factory. I remember this was my favorite restaurant when I was in high school, I haven't been back for many years! So I decided to come back with my family for dinner. Cheesecake factory is always busy, so we came here on a weekend so it would be a short wait! Although we came early, it was still busy. We didn't have to wait very long though. I love that this place has such a variety of foods. The salads are delicious. The burgers are ginormous. The pasta is yummy. The bread is warm and chewy. Everything here is yum, you can always find something here for the whole family!  The reason I am giving this place 3 stars is for the service. I felt like our waiter was unattentive. Although nice, he seemed rush. He gave us our check when he gave us our dessert. When does cheesecake factory do this? He asked us for boxes when we weren't even finish with our foods. What the heck? I just didn't like the service. Usually, I find the service here relatively decent but that one time just made me angry. I definitely will come back, I love cheesecake and the foods here, but be aware - service might not be top notch or pleasing. If you do come here, don't forget to get the cheesecake - yum! Also, their servings are large. I ordered a salad - enough for two meals! Definitely a steal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=360

Staja J.,"Sacramento, CA",172,90,144,3.0,7/28/2014,"For some reason this restaurant has never knocked my socks off but you know you can get decent food here. Honestly, I am not a fan of restaurants that have a tone of menu items. Long story short, I never suggest this place for dinner but when I do have to take one for the team and come here I know I will be able to find something to eat. DECOR: Always very nice. Perfect for a casual or semi-fancy dinner.  FOOD: I mean it is alright. Super basic food in my opinion but how fancy can you get if you have 500 items on the menu? LOL. The food is decent, I always leave full. I actually really love the crab cakes here. Really decent for the price. I am glad I discovered them on my recent visit so now I can have something to look forward to when I get dragged here. BUT. The cheese cake is terrible. It tastes super processed which honestly broke my heart because I love cheesecake. You would think a place called ""Cheesecake Factory"" would be able to get at least the cheesecake right...sad sad sad.  SERVICE: The staff is always pretty good. You can tell they are well trained. One thing I love about CCF is that the staff wears all white. It makes me feel like they do their best to stay clean and be clean. Wearing all white just gives off a good impression. Also, I love that this place is open late.  Overall, I do not mind taking one for the team when I have to come here but I am always expecting average food...nothing spectacular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=360

Linde H.,"Alameda, CA",352,181,138,4.0,9/20/2014,"I really really like this place.  Well, just cheesecake factories in general. Whenever I come here, I usually get too full off the bread and butter before I can even get to my meal. I do have a usual though, I drink the island ice tea with 2 packets of the sugar in the raw, then for pasta, I usually get the pasta da vinci or the louisiana chicken pasta. The pasta da vinci is so sweet, it has penne pasta and a creamy whine sauce with mushrooms and thinking about it right now makes my mouth water. The louisiana is creamy but has a little kick of spice in it topped chicken that's crispy till you get full and leave it in the fridge for the next day.  Leftovers aren't bad though folks.

I ordered my favorite thing in the world: Fettucine Alfredo with Chicken.  Uh, yummmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  My eyes totally lit up when the food arrived. Yes, this place is a teensy-bit pricy. My dish was around $16+ and so are most others I've seen. But they give very generous food portions! It was so delicious (a bit oily though). I ended up forgetting to save room for one of their famous slice of cheesecake. Oh well, worth it.  I will definitely be back so I'm not too worried about missing out on dessert.

The appetizers are always delicious but my entrees either end up bring great, or I'm left dissatisfied and un impressed.  I went this past Friday and I must say that I left dissatisfied. Server took forever to bring the bread, and when she did it was extremely hard! When my friend told her the bread was pretty hard her response was ""That's how it's supposed to be."" We were both in shock and disgusted at her attitude. We both ordered pasta dishes, he got the Cajun Chicken Pasta which was good, and I had the Chicken Pasta with Scampi Sauce. I've had this dish before and it was full of flavor, however, this time the sauce was flavorless and my pasta was a bit dry. I asked for some extra sauce and the server again gave me an attitude. I work in customer service so when I ask for something or bring something to someones attention I'm always pleasant and professional. This gal just had an attitude.  I will say .... for an appetizer .... I highly recommend the Firecracker Salmon! It's always delicious, flavorful, and not too heavy, so it leaves room for all the food they give you as an entree. Because of the poor service this time....we didn't even want to stay for dessert.

You get to your table and the menu im not kidding, is 11 pages long. They must have at least 150 dinner dishes to pick from. The free bread was the most flavorful and fullfilling thing here even though its fairly small you find yourself just waiting for them to bring you more free bread.  Wife had meatloaf and I had a burger.  Both were about as untriumphant and a letdown, as a cat taking a piss on your blanket. Oh wait the dessert cant be bad right? Wrong!

Fried Macaroni and Cheese:  I'm not a fan of Mac & Cheese, but these fried cheese balls were filled with perfectly cooked pasta and cheesy deliciousness. Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese:  Sweet and tangy flavor over a thin crust of crispy flat bread. Crispy Crab Bites:  Yumm-O!  What can I say? Mahi Mahi & Shrimp Vera Cruz:  My friend ordered an entree from the SkinnyLicious Menu.  The fish and shrimp were perfectly cooked, and the flavor profile for the entire dish was superb.  Perfect dish as an appetizer for two if you're sharing.

She was an excellent waitress, she visited our table a handful of times throughout the dining experience. She wasn't overwhelming nor was she leaving anything to be desired. I made sure to ask her name and tell her myself she was a great waitress. The food is always good here, I feel they're a bit on the pricey side, but oh well, I keep coming back don't I? My girlfriend got the Cajun jambalaya pasta and I got the pepperoni pizza. She said her dish was fine and mine was okay it's not that it wasn't made good, but it wasn't made to my particular liking. I'm more of a thicker crust, a bit more sauce, lighter cheese kind of guy. I typically get their spicy buffalo chicken sandwich and it's always perfect, but this time I tried something different, so now I know to go with my usual entree. Like I said, the pizza wasn't bad at all, it's just not how I like my pizza. Let me note that this particular trip here was 5 stars, but the reason I am giving 4 stars overall is because my first time being here a couple years back I was with a couple friends and I felt like we were being profiled based on appearance (tattoos, baggy clothes, etc.) So that definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for a while then I decided to give it a second go-round and have been satisfied ever since.

Hi I'm Cameron F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/18/2016,"In  my attempt to find a place that was open later on a Sunday and served a wide variety of foods we ended up here.I wanted to go to the Porch,... The Food ar Cheesecake Factory generally consists of frozen and fried.They plate the food for the most part.Frozen,fried foods.There is no ""whole foods"" going on back there.The chef's quickly add on the fresh veggies. We orders several appetizers/small plates. We had an order of Chicken pot stickers,and an order of their spin on a Cubano sandwich,fried and presented  like a spring roll, served with some sort of  mayo dip.We had their Samosas,Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, and I ordered a Beets with goat cheese salad. We ordered various entrées. I felt bad for my sister in law,eating fish at that place.I would ONLY eat fresh fish.I'm just saying! The issue with the cake and the service! There is no need to say on your birthday,you just want to relax and have a nice evening with your family and friends.You have a  service expectation.When you manage to make everyone  want to leave,that's just not the experience you signed up for. We had a special bithday cake made at a bakery in Oakland,a Tres Leche cake.Nearly any restaurant will charge a fee if you bring outside food or drink. No problem! However,they are still supposed  to serve it to us!  My parents gave the cake with basic instructions,. (Like, please serve this ), and our name on it when we arrived.My family spoke with our waitress as we were seated. I have ate there several times.I have had 2 bad dining experiences there.This was by far the worst of both negative dining experiences there. After dinner,we waited for approximately 30 minutes talking,waiting.I was nervous  they would sing happy birthday to me.No cake came.No waitress.Finally my mom checked,  and they forgot about the cake.They brought the orders of  strawberries we ordered.Some of our party wanted ice cream and she never came back.My father wanted to complain to managment but I just wanted to leave. For nearly a 30 minutes we sat there talking,no one asked if we wanted coffee,or any other dessert items.She did not come to check on us once.We would question if they were get the cake and then that turned into did she forget about the cake.Again,she did not come back to check on us.My mom had to fo find somone. The cake was dropped of at our table.It was not cut, nor did they give us anything to cut the cake with, or clean plates.They should have brought the cake over,on a cake tray, OUT of the box.Or, asked us if they were not sure.An apology for our wait and for their mistake would have been apprexiated.This qualifies for HORRIBLE SERVICE. I will say this,typically their service is better than this.I have had pretty good service.This is my second encounter with a lousy waitress or waiter there,but she was by far the worst.She certainly needs more training,but the manager/supervisor also needs to be aware of what is going on in the restaurant too. The service of the waitress was rude.I noticed it right away She was not friendly,she had an attitude.She dis not check on us.She did not ask us if we wanted more of the bread.She seemed very distracted.Her service not only did not meet my expectations,for my birthday.She managed to upset everyone there,with her rude personality,lack of service as no show, for my cake as we waited. No one ordered drinks of more deserts when they finally appeared.They  just wantes to have the cake and LEAVE.Everyone was angry that she forgot to give us the cake and kept us waiting. Food,frozen and fried.This okay plated frozen foods.There is no ""whole foods"" going on back there. Basically frozen food.The ""chefs"" add on the veggies.Most of the appetizers/small plates  are  frozen/fried. We had an order of chicken pot stickers,and an order of their spin on a Cubano sandwich,fried and presented  like a spring roll, served with a mayo dip.We had their Samosas,Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, and I ordered a small beets with goat cheese salad. We ordered various entrées. I felt bad for my sister in law,eating fish at that place.I would ONLY eat fresh fish.I'm just saying.  The food is just not for me.

The portion wasn't even big enough to share (three meatballs and a bit of noodles in a NON-MEAT based marinara sauce...) and now I'm regretting not ordering their Kobe burger, also around $15 but probably more satisfying! Their spaghetti was sweet and the sausage meatballs were OK, but it wasn't anything spectacular. They DO have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu which offers healthy alternatives of their entrees (500 or fewer calories) but, in my opinion, all they do is cut portion sizes in half and charge a dollar or two less than what the original item costs--NOT WORTH IT! The free bread they give out is always GOOD (especially their brown bread)... just refrain from peeking at the nutritional facts! :P For actual FOOD, I'd rate them a 2/5--I've never been ""WOW'ed"" by their entrees/appetizers/brunch specials.  I would recommend ONLY coming here for dessert!! Their cheesecakes are DELICIOUS and they have so many to choose from you're bound to find something you like! They even offer non-cheesecake items including; tiramisu, carrot cake, warm apple crisp, Linda's fudge cake, black-out cake, chocolate tower truffle cake, strawberry shortcake, and lemoncello cream tortes. My favorite cheesecakes are the 30th Anniversary chocolate cake (original cheesecake, fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream), white chocolate raspberry truffle, fresh banana cream cheesecake (banana cheesecake topped with bavarian cream and freshly slices bananas), their original cheesecake with strawberry toppings, and their dutch apple caramel streusel (their original cheesecake, baked apples, and a caramel and brown sugar walnut streusel). I've tried their low-carb original cheesecake with strawberries which is sweetened with Splenda and, in my opinion, if you're going to indulge in cheesecake you might as well stick to the ORIGINAL! Cheat meals are OK every once in a while anyways so treat yourself! :)  For cheesecakes I'd rate them a 4/5.   Our waiter, Andrew, was really nice and gave good suggestions on what cheesecakes to order. He was attentive without coming off as being annoying. The service here is always pretty good! (5/5). I'd rate the overall cleanliness of the restaurant a 4/5, their lighting is so dim it's hard to tell what's clean and what isn't. The restaurant itself is very modern and nice for date nights when you're looking to go somewhere slightly upscale and ""safe."" I say ""safe"" because they have a lot of menu items to choose from, anywhere from your typical pizza, pasta, burgers and fries to salmon, salads, and steaks, and portion sizes are usually HUGE so you can always share. Overall, I'd only come back here to PICK-UP cheesecakes versus actually dining in!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=400

Tiles on the ceiling, Roman columns, Tuscan murals and Egyptian decor? What is this, an adult restaurant version of 'It's a Small World'?) But I was in the mood for a steak and this seemed to be the only reasonably-priced local restaurant open on a late Sunday night. We sat outside on the heated patio, which was delightfully quiet and uncrowded compared to inside. Man, that venue is always packed like they're giving away... well, cheesecake. The staff was attentive and friendly. The service was prompt. My friend got the Mushroom Burger and I got the Steak Diane. We enjoyed the food, everything tasted fine, and my white sangria cocktail was really good. We left with what seemed to be a good experience. Aaaand then 2 hours later we both got food poisoning. I had a nasty sour stomach, but my poor friend had chills/fever that night and was throwing up the whole next day.

They have their niche. They are somewhere in a range above Olive Garden and below your local fine dining. They are not TGIF but they also are not that 5-star 2 month wait on reservations establishment.  Yes the menu can be overwhelming. Goodness gracious it's a novel. But they do capture something for everyone...from appetizers to entrees to delectable desserts and of course the best cheesecakes in the Western Hemisphere. The place can be cheesy (no pun intended), but it is a place where all walks of life can meet at neutral ground. While meeting at neutral they can enjoy great food, great drinks and yes again the best cheesecakes around.  The miso salmon, wasabi tuna, and the jambalaya pasta are killer. I try to stay away from this trifecta of deliciousness but I just can't. For the cheesecakes, just try them all. My favorite is the Dutch Apple and the pineapple upside down.

Aron E.,"Tracy, CA",25,9,1,5.0,1/1/2015,"If you're looking for the most interesting (and delicious!) variety of cheesecakes in the valley, come here. If you want to try a host of great food before you skip to dessert, come here. If you're looking for neither, still come here. You will become a believer. As soon as you walk in the door, you'll notice the tidy and inviting atmosphere, as well as the fresh display of almost every cheesecake they have to your left. Once you see those, you know you're coming back. Maybe not tomorrow or next week, as you'll need to recuperate, but face it: you're coming back. The restaurant always looks great. Its colors are relaxing and eye-pleasing, the buidling itself is spacious, and has outdoor and bar seating. The bathroom usually doesn't reek of urine, which is one of the highest forms of compliment I can give to a public restroom. When you sit down to order, they will offer you sweet wheat bread, and either white or sourdough along with butter. And no, you don't get to choose between white and sourdough; I was just too busy stuffing my face with wheat to recall which one it was! The food gets better every time I order. My favorite item on the menu by far is Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp for three words: sweet, spicy Thai. I had to stop myself from ordering it the last few visits so that I could experience a spot of the rest of the huge menu. This is a real item, I kid you not: a burger with topped with fried macaroni and cheese, smothered in more cheese. Need I say that I was scarfing it down during a conversation with abandon? Fish and chips come with huge portions of fish, fries (substitutable for sweet potato), and cole slaw. Everything is huge. For health buffs, you may want the alternate menu, as hardly anything runs under quadruple digits for calories. The cheesecake is served in either large, thick slices for around 7.50 or one of two full cake sizes for special occasions (the larger ones go for 50). Allow me to list off the ones you'll probably want: the large, multi-layered Ultimate Red Velvet, the caramel-covered White Chocolate Macadamia with its sweet cookie-tasting crust, the seasonal flavors, Peppermint and Pumpkin, and the legions of chocolate-based flavors, including Snickers, Reese's, Godiva, mousse, and 30th anniversary cake. That is hardly a third of them. I plan to try them all in years to come. They also have traditional desserts on their menu, which is cute. I may try them someday. The only slight I have against this restaurant is this one server who was visibly and audibly anxious about me ordering several slices of cheesecake to go. It was very rude. Thankfully, I know now to circumvent a rude server by ordering from the counter instead of the table. I'll take my dessert without a side of bullshit, thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=420

Lily D.,"Roseville, CA",78,451,1213,3.0,1/30/2015,"I have not been to a cheesecake factory since 2009 because my last few experiences did not wow me enough to come back.  Decided to try again as I was in the area on business. We walked in around noon on a thursday.  Place was busy but not packed.  I put my name in, walked away for a Minute, and came back to ask how long the wait would be.  She asked me, ""how many in your party?"" Um, i was just here literally a minute ago and you could not remember you already took my name down? I asked how long and she says, ""not long, we'll call you.""  Not digging the lack of info as I was on a schedule.  Anyways, we were seated within 5 mins along the row where its one long bench seats and one wicker chair across the table so you are seated quited close to people next to you.  Waitress came within a 7 mins to take our order.  We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and it was much smaller than expected for $6.99 but good.  The ""helper"" that delivered it first tried giving our artichoke to the table next to us until we got his attention it was ours.   We waited 30 mins for our food to arrive and never saw our waitress during that time.  My friend got the turkey sandwich and salad and I got the lunch portion crusted parmesan chicken.  Both were delicious. However, we again hardly saw our waitress and we had to get going as our lunch hour had passed so we put our credit card out for her to slide to save us time when we finally got the bill.  I looked at the bill and she charged us for drinks when we only had waters which turned out to be the table next us drink order.  Again waited another 10 mins before she ever came back.  Pointed this out and she was gone again for quite some time.  Then had to ask if she voided the original transaction.  She asks, ""did i slide your card?""  so she disapeared AGAIN to fix it.  UGH.  This whole ordeal had us there for 90 mins which should have been only an hour.  I wanted to get dessert but ran out of time.  I give the food a 5 but the service is a 1 so they get an average of 3. Disapointing and made for a very long day as I had to make up my time at work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=420

Myke Y.,"San Francisco, CA",546,147,10357,4.0,12/3/2013,"Ahhh The Cheesecake Factory, widely known for its humungous portions of proteins, fowl, and seafood.  However, on this particular mission, I did not partake in any such delectable food adventures, as I had a liquid dinner, mainly consisting of, or course whiskey.  The mission was specific, it was specifically planned, like ripping a band-aid off, it was overly due, and yes, the force was with me. And now that it's in the rear view, never to be an issue again, a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, I've cleared my mind, my soul, and have never been more focused and happy moving on.  Ok, let's talk about the drinks!  San Pellagrino water to start while the bartender concocted my Macallan 12 on the rocks (shame most establishments don't stock on 18/25+, but I understand... $$$).  I usually have it neat but it was already warm there in a packed bar/house.  And so as the condensation wrapped around my ice cold glass, I took a whiff of that sweet, oak, sherry filled aroma only my whiskey can give me.  And once it hit my lips, the sweet burn from the aged single-malt, to the smooth finish rolling from my tongue down my throat, coating it with the finest blend of alcohol known to man... in that moment, in that warm feeling, I knew it was going to be just fine the rest of the night.  And so were the next three rounds.   Alas, feeling warm, comfortable, and now satisfied from completing my mission, ""Mission unfinished business"", I left satisfied, content, and ready to a little tipsy, hehe.  It was the perfect setting to close out that chapter of my life, and as I walked out the doors to see the glowing lights of The Cheesecake Factory, I also walked into a new life full of happiness and mental focus that no one can break.  Thanks again for a splendid time TCF, was very happy to be back in the 916.

It's the only consistent thing that he has always ordered here.  So I will try to remember everything that I have ordered there. I've had their calamari and shrimp summer rolls. The calamari is ok.. Nothing too special. The rolls are good, it comes with 3 rolls and I got pretty full with just that. I didn't like the kale salad. The cheesecakes are always so good.

Thank you, Cheesecake Factory, for being responsible! I love the Thai Lettuce Wraps- more than enough for two people, but hey, also enough for one without guilt.  The drinks are fantastic. The strawberry martinis are out of this world. If you need comfort food, I highly recommend this place. Unfortunately, you get a lot of people who like to act pretentious, which I'm sure the staff don't appreciate either- and by the way, staff have ALWAYS been courteous here.

For some reason I was not expecting them to be fried, but they were still pretty tasty, regardless. Shared an entree of the luau salad and the garlic noodles with shrimp. The luau salad was awesome! A little on the sweet side for a salad, but I enjoyed the different vegetables and the bits of mango and the crunchy sesame cracker. The presentation was quite divine as well! The noodles were good but not great; they were more on the oily side. I did enjoy the accompaniment of the sundried tomatoes and mushrooms mixed in. Our waitress seemed to be in a bit of a rush, but not a big deal as I did not feel overly pressured to order. For dessert we had the pumpkin cheesecake, as I am a huge pumpkin fan.

Tim N.,"Sacramento, CA",233,13,,5.0,6/25/2016,"My friends and I arrived at The Cheesecake Factory on a busy Saturday evening around 5:30. Because Arden Fair is pretty busy on weekend evenings, it first took a while to find parking (I ended up parking in front of the UA entrance). After I walked over to the restaurant, I discovered that it would take nearly two hours before a table would be ready. Because we had a party of 15, I'm assuming that wait time is ""fairly reasonable"" - in the mean time, some of us visited Arden while the others remained to look over the menu. After our table was furnished, we were greeted by a friendly server and were served bread and drinks. The server was extremely professional in demeanor and illuminated our experience with small-talk. Some of my friends ordered sole cheesecake, while others ordered pasta and I ordered the Steak Diane - with such an array of menu options, the worst part of our experience was deciding which plate to order. After consuming the provided bread, our entrees were delivered in a timely manner. My stead was cooked well, but the entire dish was sitting in a pool of steak sauce, which was somewhat overwhelming. As we ate our meals, our waiter checked in periodically to ensure that everything was going smoothly and even bagged our plates to-go at the end of the meal. Overall, the experience is definitely worth the price - with the whole ""a little extra goes a long way"" mentality - and it is safe to say that I will be returning shortly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=460

Thor F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,2,4.0,6/3/2015,"I ordered a pesto style chicken pizza which was delicious (I am sorry that I do not remember the exact item name). The portions and food were good, the only item of discrepancy I had with the place had more to do with price. I understand prestige branding and quality ingredients, what I do not understand is when your burger items start at $12.00 and other places that specialize in burgers such as Red Robins begin their menu items at a more reasonable price. Other then that I would advise those who do not want to wait to make reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=480

Michael C.,"Sacramento, CA",40,11,,2.0,11/18/2015,Don't order mexican food anywhere other than a mexican restaurant. Not sure how many times I need to learn that lesson.  This was my first time to the cheesecake factory. I ordered their burrito which sounded good. I had high hopes this would be a better experience since there is so much hype around this business.  The red sauce tastes more like spaghetti sauce it was tolerable. But what really was upsetting was the rice. It was undercooked which is something I can't stand. I asked that they remake it and I think they just used the same batch of rice cause the second one came out and it was also undercooked. At this point I was too polite to bring it up. I was under the impression that the burrito was comped at this point but instead they removed it from my receipt and then added it again to the receipt. I think they somehow hoped I would see the removal and not see that they added it again. I thought that seemed kinda weird. I asked them why it wasn't comped and she said the manager brought a salad to hold me over and that would somehow make it right. She said she would go to her manager and see if the cheesecake could be comped. So in the end my burrito ended up being 50 % off but was still unsatisfactory cause undercooked rice is just gross.  Here is the good. The cheesecake was delicious but super rich. I am fine with that. I just eat a little at a time and put it back in the fridge. The Reeses cheesecake was delicious. My husband ordered a burger and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will be back for cheesecake but I really think they should treat the customer with a little more respect and quality check their ingredients. I can't say this enough undercooked rice is gross. You wouldn't give a customer undercooked meat so why would you give them undercooked rice.

My boyfriend and I came here last night to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. Much to our surprise we arrived to find it was National Cheesecake Day (1/2 price cheesecake for dine-in customers).  When I walked in, there was a line of at least 15-20 people ahead of me simply waiting to put their names on the list to be seated. I considered leaving just by seeing the line but decided to wait it out. When I got to the front, I was happily greeted by the hostess. Her mood was extremely cheery and bubbly despite all the chaos and the hectic work shift I'm sure she was having. She told me the wait time would be about 20-25 minutes and took my phone number so she could shoot me a text when my table was ready. How cool is that?! If there's a long wait, you can easily head over to Arden for a while and do some shopping and then just head back a few minutes before your estimated wait time is up without having to worry you'll deactivate the usual buzzers restaurants give you. Anyways, the wait was about 25 minutes as she said, not too bad for such a busy day. Very soon after we were seated, a worker brought us bread and then shortly after that we were greeted by our waiter. BIG shoutout to our waiter, Luis L, for being absolutely amazing. He kept my drink refilled at all times despite my immense thirst and my quick emptying of my glass, he was very friendly and always checked in on us to ensure we were doing well. I ordered the Chicken Madeira and my boyfriend ordered the California Cheesesteak. Both of us were extremely satisfied with our meals; taste, temperature and serving size were all on point. One of the best parts of the whole night  was being able to get two slices of cheesecake for the price of one (thanks National Cheesecake Day!)

Lor G.,"Carmichael, CA",0,42,8,2.0,6/11/2015,"I use to come here for their Skinnylicious herb crusted salmon salad served on a bed of baby greens with asparagus, tomato and tossed with their vinaigrette dressing. Today and the time before last, I have been very disappointed in the quality. They use to serve the salad with a freshly cooked salmon fillet. Now they actually state, 'Chilled Salmon' on their menu. Well, you know what that means! Cold salmon that has been sitting in the refrigerator (probably overnight). For $17 I expect fresh cooked salmon.... like right then, when I order it.  Since I have received the chilled salmon twice, I specifically asked the waiter to tell the cook in the back that I would like my salmon freshly prepared and not chilled.           Now my mama didn't raise no dumb bunny, and I know when I've been bamboozled. So, when my salad arrived, the salmon was room temp and dry as a piece of shoe leather. Which tells me that the cook took a piece of salmon out of the refrigerator and put it in the microwave to heat it up. I had to take sips of ice tea just to wash the dry (hard around the edges) Salmon down. I mentioned it to our waiter and he said that he specified ""freshly prepare salmon"" on the ticket and made special mention to the chef.  Chef! Really? There IS a difference between a chef and a short order cook, which I suspect is what the Cheese Cake Factory has cooking the food, back in the kitchen. Seriously, no ""chef"" worth his/her salt would ever let a piece of freshly grilled salmon come to a customer that dried out and tough All it takes is for me to be lied too. Then it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth for all their yummy desserts. Epic fail Cheese Cake Factory! I will certainly NOT be a returning customer.

I will say the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp though was probably the best dishes I've ever tried from them and I've tried my fair share of dishes from them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=520
Lynn H.,"Sacramento, CA",180,357,194,2.0,5/21/2012,"Yeah, after my one good experience - The Cheesecake Factory has dropped back into mediocrity. Their food was meh... I got the some kinda of peanut noodles... I guess I couldn't be mad at them for false advertising - Because it tasted exactly like peanut butter with noodles. Not so good.  My b/f got a sandwich... Nothing to write home about.  The cheesecake is usually pretty darn good but I got the pineapple upside down cheesecake... It was too fancy, I think. Anyway, not too happy with this place. I am always surprised to see how it could have such a long line when the food is very mediocre. I'll be back to use the rest of my giftcard, but I probably won't be coming back soon after.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=520
Charlie W.,"Stockton, CA",0,25,,1.0,7/31/2016,"Worse meal ever at CCF. Usually one of my favorite restaurants but went for Sunday brunch and never again.  Ordered waffle and fried chicken benedict. Took a long time to get our entrees and now I know why. Fried chicken was barely warm so had been sitting around for a while before being served. Potatoes were way overcooked and a very dark brown color and dried. Hollandaise sauce had no flavor. Only good thing was the maple syrup - guess it's hard to ruin something that you pour out of a bottle. Should have returned the meal, but it was Sunday after church so did not want to make a fuss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=520

Even during the call to ask about the survey, the two that picked up the phone did not ask if they could help me, take my concern. Both occasions the food was cold, yet I was 5 minutes after the ready in 10 minute window. I think it is safe to say they don't keep it warm.

Also, I just want to add that the restaurant was not busy at all. We have been there before and know that bread is standard. Not that we care about bread too much, but all other waitresses and waiters around us were serving bread and we never got any. We finally asked for some, just to see what she would say. She responded with ""I guess I can do that"". We received the bread with the meal, so we didn't even eat it. I asked the waitress to bring ranch with my food, she didn't and then disappeared. My boyfriend had to stand up and find another waitress to ask for it. We didn't see our waitress again until we paid. Overall kind of an awful experience.

Yes the food is delicious and the service pretty good (not the best I've ever had tho) but even talking to the manager did not help us out.

I went into Cheesecake Factory recently and there was a long wait, which is fine, but I decided to go to the bar for a drink. I ordered a classic margarita with an extra shot ( the original drink was too sweet). I was content with my drink until I got the bill. My bill, without the tip, was $23. I don't see how one drink can end up being so much! The tequila was nothing special like Petron, so the price did not equal the quality.

It's soft and a little sweet; it tastes well with the melted butter.   My bf and I were just there for lunch. We shared a regular sized sun dried tomato and chicken fettuccine. It will full you up! It's creamy and a bit tangy from the tomatoes. It's good, but not special. But how special can pasta get?  I generally order a slice of Godiva cheesecake, one of the best cheesecakes I have eaten so far. I love dark chocolate, so the degree of bitterness is great for me. I remember the first time I had it, right after I swallow that first bite, I felt a cool feeling in my mouth. It is a must try!  So I decided to try something different, the Reese's cake cheesecake. It was too sweet for me, but it would be good for someone who loves milk chocolate and peanut butter. For me, the cake layer took up too much space compared to the cheesecake layer. It was too rich and too high in calories for me to eat it all at once, so as usual, I finished it in 2 days (with my bf's help)!

Jenny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",391,160,175,4.0,9/29/2011,"I personally feel that Cheesecake Factory is underappreciated in terms of their food.

The meats are cooked well, the sauces are flavorful, and the portions are generous. Also, the service is responsive and the ambiance is casual, but elegant. On weekends, I come here for the Lunch Special. I am particularly fond of the pizza and side salad special. Delicious, comes with enough food to take home, and very affordable.  My only gripe is that their prices can be a bit steep. Many of the meat and pasta dishes are around $18, which is the main reason I don't eat here more often. Yet at the same time, there are dozens of restaurants I can think of with cheaper prices but far worse tasting food.

I stand there in front of the display like a little kid trying to figure out which one I want to try out at the end of our dinner!  We ended up ordering the Chicken samosas, Crab cake bites, side salad with house vinaigrette and the Rib eye.  The chicken samosas were yummy... but the cilantro dip was a little too plain. I tasted more of the sour cream. but otherwise still a yummy appetizer. It came with 4 samosas.  The crab cake bites were scrumptious!!! Perfectly fried and paired with a mustard dipping sauce. I would say that the 6 mini bites are equivalent to 1 regular size crab cake.  As far as the side salad goes... there really isn't much to say, beside that the purple cabbage should either be drenched in the vinaigrette or at least be separated so it is able to absorb some more of the dressing as well.  The rib eye was fine. It was cooked a little too well done. We asked for medium. But it was still ok. Nothing to brag about here.

In my opinion there are 2 reasons to come here the first is the squaw bread you can at your table and the second is the obvious cheesecake.  You're not going to get amazing or stellar service here. It is no longer an mid to upscale place to go have a lunch or dinner because it is cram packed full of families with screaming children and annoying teenagers.

The food was very bland, had no flavor and was lacking any sort of ""I'm worth $25 a plate... I will not come back to this location, both mine and my boyfriend's food tasted awful.

Great atmosphere indoors and outdoors for family and friends.  Huge variety of food for all times of the day.  Service was on point, our waitress was quick to respond to anything we threw at her (especially knives).  Go on off times for eating unless you want to wait 30 minutes to an hour (Our wait was approx 15 min).  Dine in or take out.  A must-stop by and check out their cheesecake display.  Definitely love this place!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=580

I tend to avoid Cheesecake Factory right around dinner-time just because it always means a wait.  However, if you come later on in the night, especially on weeknights, there usually will be a number of open tables.  My boyfriend and I usually will pick out a cheesecake from the display and share a piece. On our last visit, we shared the Mango Key-lime cheesecake.  It had a nice (kind of different) tartness to it.  It was worth a try, but not as great as other cheesecakes I've had there.  What I like about the Cheesecake Factory is that there are always new flavor combinations of cheesecakes available.  My boyfriend and I really like to try new things, rather than just sticking with what we've had before, so this is a great way to try new desserts/cheesecakes. Notes: -If you don't want to wait, you can order a slice of cheesecake to go.  They package it nicely and still give you plenty of whipped cream. -There is plenty of parking because it's located in a giant parking lot.  They even have valet parking if you're interested.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=580

Prices are reasonable and service was really good. The kitchen did an amazing job with our large party's diverse orders.

If you've never been to Cheesecake Factory I suggest that you try their Chicken Madeira...it never disappoints! And it shouldn't being that it costs $17.95. The positive side of that price is that its enough for 2 people to eat! As a matter of fact..even their ""lunch"" size meals are enough for 2 to share (if you don't want it all for yourself like me).  This meal is so good that it even made the nuked Styrofoam plate that I warmed the leftovers on taste good! (I don't advise you to use Styrofoam plates...it may not be too healthy for ya to intake but in this instance I COULD CARE LESS! Nom nom nom :)  The service was great! We got plenty of refills of the complimentary bread and butter so we didn't even bother to order appetizers. Its located outside of Arden Mall (duh) so be prepared for there to be a crowd. We went around 5pm on a Sunday and for a party of 4, we didn't have but a 5 minute wait to be seated. That's awesome! This is a go to place for a nice family experience. And we always leave with doggy bags. So if the price scares you (about $64.00 to feed 4 people, that's without ordering dessert.

Tiffany K.,"Sacramento, CA",812,1020,303,4.0,4/4/2011,"Maybe I'm flogging a dead horse, 'cause 22 of my best Yelpie friends have already said their two cents about the Cheesecake Factory. HOWEVER none of them mentioned the Happy Hour which is Monday-Friday from 4:00 - 6:00.  Call me uneducated, but I never really thought of a place called 'Cheesecake Factory' to have a killer happy hour. The appetizer portions are full sized which means you could totally make a meal out of these things! Sure they are deep fried and probably contain a gazillion calories, but they sure go nicely with a $5 Cosmo.  What I can recall from the $5 appetizer menu: * Deep friend avocado rolls - I have been told that these are fantastic * Fried Macaroni & Cheese cubes * Calamari - very tender, great aioli sauce * Sweet corn tamale cakes * Buffalo Blasts - rice paper wrapped spicy chicken that is (you guessed it) deep fried * Fried chicken sliders Drink-wise, they had long islands, margaritas, cosmpolitans, etc. all for $5. They make great drinks too!  So yeah, it is a chain, but for a chain, the service is good, the food is good (huge portions!) and the ambiance - while a bit over the top - is nice. Looking around, you had your office parties, birthday dinners, families, couples and dates. My friend Theresa had the Red Velvet Cheesecake.

He made sure to ask us exactly how we wanted our martinis prepared, which I appreciated. There aren't a whole lot of ways to mess up a martini but there are many ways to make one better by personalization. And he did. My friend and I shared the white bean hummus and a chopped salad. Both amazing! And it wasn't a problem when we asked for share plates, more bread, or fresh ground pepper. The prices weren't cheap but the portions were hefty and everything was very very tasty. Don was on his game. Also a pleasant guy to chat with. It's uncomfortable when bartenders never speak a word to you - We know you can hear our entire conversation so please don't pretend otherwise. Conversely I dislike when bartenders talk too much - as nice as we're all being to each other, you aren't the person I came to have a drink with. Don had the right balance of friendly attentiveness.

I guess not ;) Now two cases here and trying to be compact as time is precious :) A) If you already been to 'the cheesecake factory' then           -You know what to expect nice long wait..use smartphone or spend quality time with date girl or watch out..Its good to look around :)           - Now coming back to service, man its your luck. You will not sure which server you will hit upon. I rather find them professional and nice unless they having terrible bad day :) Be considerate and take it easy :) B) New comer    - Yes man(women) all the buzz is really worth it. You taking for a date or special occasion, this experiment wont fall on your face. They have plenty of sweet options and lots of people around.  Go for it. They have huge portions and not too super expensive. Some spots just try to pretend trendy and rob your pocket.

Mark L.,"Portland, OR",226,96,15,5.0,6/20/2013,"Two words: Chicken Bellagio ...okay, three more words: is freakin' amazing. I've been to Cheesecake Factory stores up and down California, and had a consistently pleasant experience, but it wasn't 5-star until I discovered and tried this incredible dish. ""Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad."" ... and it tastes even better than it sounds, if you can believe that. Along my journey of discovery, I don't think I had anything I didn't like. A few standouts: - Fried Macaroni and Cheese - You can't go wrong frying mac n' cheese - Four Cheese Pasta - In case the name doesn't sink in, avoid if you don't like cheese; otherwise it's awesome - Monte Cristo - Delicious, but super rich, so plan on sharing, or taking half or more home However, I've certainly had several dishes that I wouldn't order again. Here's the quick list: - Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" - Chicken fingers on par with what'd you'd get at the fair - Orange Chicken - Stick with Panda Express or Trader Joe's for your Orange Chicken - Bang - Bang Chicken and Shrimp - This one is my fault, as I'm not wild about coconut, and this dish was bathed in the stuff And then of course, there's the cheesecake. Good gracious... I've had so many different ones, and they're all so good, none of them really stand out. When it's time to order dessert, just close your eyes and point, you won't be disappointed. Portions are crazy, so come hungry, or ready to share, or clear some room in your fridge for leftovers. I usually enjoy the second half of my dish the next day for lunch,.along with some of the fantastic molasses bread. Sure, it's crowded, and that critique has applied to all 8+ locations I've been to, so just plan for a wait time or go during off-peak hours. At this location at Arden, we've gotten here by 5:30 on a Friday and only waited a couple minutes. Oh, and I've never had a bad service experience, at least that I remember. Everybody always seems really chipper. Almost eerily so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=600

Mark W.,"Sacramento, CA",5,29,,5.0,5/29/2013,"I just love Cheesecake Factory.  They make so many different types of food, that its hard to believe they can do them well.  But the fact is that I've ordered a bunch of different meals, appetizers, and drinks, and they are always really good. My wife and I have gone there several times over the last few months and the experience has been consistently good.  Here are some of my favorite dishes: Vietnamese Tacos - these are tiny, but tasty.  You could argue its not a very good value, but oh my God, they are so delicious!  The soft taco ""shell"" is like a bao bun, and just a little sweet.  The filling is sweet, tangy, spicy, and delicious. Beef Skinnylicious Soft Tacos - how are these under 800 calories? They are beef soft tacos, topped with avocado salsa.  The shells are corn - not steamed corn or fried corn, but lightly grilled maybe? They are some of the best tacos I've ever had, and I've eaten a lot of tacos. Skinny Tuscan chicken - again, how is this on the skinny menu? The portion was huge; more than I could eat, and it all tasted amazing. Chicken Bellagio - olive oil, pesto, Parmesan chicken, angel hair pasta.  Amazing. Oh, dessert.  Yah, I haven't even tried ether cheesecake in a long time. I know it's awesome but I never have room.  The hardest part about cheesecake is deciding which one to try.   I have never had a bad or even mediocre experience at Cheesecake Factory.  I look forward to going back again and again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=600

Well i will just stop there because I don't know what the hell they put in that because it made me SICK! Not the taste it must have been loaded with sugar or something because I could barely concentrate after drinking it and I have never ever had such a problem before! With that being said I had to get my food to go and It was ehhh and I had also ordered a side of Mac and cheese that was flavorless and the grease actually burned a whole in my container. However the banana cheesecake is delicious! I kinda always thought that this place was sorta gourmet but now I know that it's NOT!

I had ordered the Pasta Carbonara while my partner had the Chipotle Pasta. My food was very delicious and the only reason I'm even considering giving stars to this location. The Chipotle Pasta was debatable. We thought that maybe putting more Parmesan Cheese would make the taste settle down a little. We both raised our hands when a server had turned and she looked at us and completely walked away. We waited for our original server, Marie and after waiting finally got her attention and requested for cheese. She aggravatedly shredded the cheese toppling over on the table and on my partner. She quickly turned around. My partner & I looked at each other out of awe from how rude she was. On top of all this the knife had a green stain on it.

Despite a busy night, the waiters were all really prompt and courteous!  The food came out quickly and, although our nachos were cold, our waiter quickly replaced it with a fresh batch with melted cheese.  Yum!! We also ordered the calamari and garlic chicken farfalle and added asparagus (definitely recommended).  Their nachos are huuuuge but they're not that great.  Everything else was  . Finally, we ended with the best part: dessert!!  Strawberry shortcake and dulce de leche to die for!  I believe it's a consensus that Cheesecake Factory serves the best dessert of all chain restaurants..it's no wonder we chose it for Valentine's Day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=600
Sally C.,"San Francisco, CA",619,339,91,4.0,12/19/2011,"A lot of my friends groaned when I chose to celebrate my 21st birthday at the Cheesecake Factory. BUT we had a great time.  Our waitress was really awesome. She made me feel really special and always asked me how I liked my food or drink and served me first before everyone else.  Came here on a Friday night with about 10 or so of my friends- we were seated outside with some nice heat lamps which she turned up for us. The hungry boys also went through about like a million bread baskets. Our faves was the brown rye bread which we just called 'the brown bread'... so we would ask her, 'Can you bring us like 5 baskets of only brown bread please?' Yes, hard to believe we are in college. She was constantly bringing us bread and did so with a smile on her face, which we really appreciated. She also laughed along with our weird conversations, haha. Ordered our food- girls got pastas and fish dishes, most of the guys got jambalaya or burgers. Everyone enjoyed the food. The waitress actually went through each drink with me to make sure I would like the one I chose. I ended up ordering the sour green apple martini. Not bad, but I liked the mango cooler someone else got.  We all had a great time and finished off the night with a bunch of cheesecakes. I must say, the cheesecakes here are sooo overpriced but so deliciously made at the same time.  Food here isn't cheap and we waited over an hour for our table, but the experience was good.

She told me it would be 30 min to 40 minutes. When 40 minutes came and went, I went up to check with her. Rather than apologize for the extended wait, she informed me In a surly tone that we had ""only waited  44 minutes"". I consider this rude and, not in any sense, good customer service.

One time when we were here, we were not waiting an unusually long time for the food, but the manager came over and told us that they forgot to cook my burger and that it would be out in a minute and they would give us a complimentary dessert. It literally arrived as she was leaving, and like I said we werent even questioning when our food was going to come out yet. Then, at the end of the meal when we were paying, they gave us a survey code to go online and rate the service and we got a $10 coupon!! Not sure if this was a random survey or not, but I've gotten it one more time since then, and they are valid for several months afterward.  Great place to bring a date ;) If you have a large party, try to call in a reservation, or prepare to wait. If you dont mind sitting outside during winter, they can usually seat you right away.

Loki N.,"Sacramento, CA",2,115,,2.0,8/13/2016,"Had lunch the other day with girlfriend. Had been a long time since I ate at one and desserts looked SO tempting. Played it safe and ordered a hot tea with lunch special of soup, salad and half a turkey sandwich. Soup was baked potato and it was delicious, having been sprinkled with crumbled bacon bits, green onions and drizzle of sour cream. Made a perfect match when dipping bread from their breadbasket into it. Loved every single drop! The salad turned out to a disappointment. Mixed greens with maybe, MAYBE a tsp of blue cheese dressing tossed with it. At least the greens were fresh but there was nothing added to it. Not abit of cheese, even croutons, nothing! Just greens with the measly tsp of dressing on it... The sandwich was some fresh sliced turkey on a roll with tomato and lettuce. The turkey was fresh and tasty but that was about it. My friend ordered the same thing and said it was only ok. We split a slice of the Kahlua chocolate cheesecake and that was wonderfully rich and sinful! Our server was okay at first but once we got our food, she was nonexistent! We had to ask for a refill of my hot water from someone else and we never got a refill on our ice water. We had to ask for a takeout box and we felt rushed and like we didn't exist. Ok I get you are busy and want to turn your table but rudeness shouldn't be rewarded tip wise. I really wanted to say some great things about it but this place sadly isn't much more than an overpriced Denny's. Lots of people seemed happy to be there so good for them, I'm happy for you, but I give one star for the soup and Kahlua cheesecake and one star for the fact a lot of people were happily celebrating special events. However, poor waitress service won't have me returning nor will I recommend it to others. Take your dining dollars and find somewhere else or get it to go if their food is your thing. Sorry folks.... PROS: Delish baked potato soup and chocolate Kahlua cheesecake. CONS: Poor waitress service soured the majority of our visit and lackluster overly priced food made this a Failure of the day for us. I had read Yelp reviews before I went but decided to give them a chance. Sadly, I won't be back...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=640

Took my frined here for a meal after we left Comedy Sportz on Arden *The BEST $20 date* I digress.....moving on I have NEVER received such bad service in my LIFE! Let me start by saying I have never been a server but do realize such people live off tips therefore I make sure to always leave something even if it's mediocre service, guess how much Luis received on our $57 bill... that's right folks not ONE darn penny! Normally I start to get anxiety about leaving a server nothing but by the end of our evening I kindly told my date, ""I hope you don't think less of me but this guy was SUCH a tool  I can NOT  muster up even a smart tip of a penny of my hard earned money and he agreed 10 fold.  The Pro's of our evening:  The Food and drinks were AWESOME! We order: *Strawberry Cheesecake * Red Velvet Cheesecake **Chicken Samosas *Appetizer Caesar Salad (that was more than enough for two maybe even three people to share) *A Mint Mojito *And a Passion Mojito (SUPER DELICIOUS) All that for $57 bucks NOT BAD AT ALL AND VERY FILLING!  Now lets discuss how Luis put a damper on the evening, the ONLY reason I gave 3 stars was I normally receive GREAT service, my company and the food we ate was great HOWEVER the overall dining experience was definitely dampened by our server.  THE CONS: Our server was an IDIOT and COMPLETELY inattentive to our table! I guess I wouldn't be as irritated if he didn't ensure he checked on the needs of the not one but two birthday table full of of ladies... guess what creeper you're loosing out on this table's tip!  Speaking of birthday, I asked before we even received our menus that they come over and sing happy birthday to my friend and THAT never happened but the perv sure made sure the table of ladies was taken care of with their birthday song. Ugh RUDE! Whats worst. He bought our cheesecake and left for five minutes..... Anyone want to guess what critical piece he left off.... go ahead I'll wait....that's right he FINALLY came back and asked how everything was and if we needed anything um yea dummy, something TO EAT MY $10 cheesecake with! -_- To which he responded oh I'm so sorry! (IDIOT) after which he began reaching over my date and I to clear our half drank cocktails an the rest of my samosas umm WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING BRO!?! 1) I'm not done with my drink and 2) I'm TOTALLY eating my somosa's in the morning BYE BYE! I kindly told him I was still eating THANKS and continued about my evening. After bring the bill and the to go boxes I KID YOU not my date barely got his cheesecake onto the plate and was seconds away from scooping his dollop of whip cream into his box when this tad grabbed his plate by then I was SO frustrated that I spoke up and let him know WHOA still boxing.

Chris S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,34,32,4.0,3/20/2015,"I usually don't leave reviews for chain restaurants but this will be the exception. I can't say enough about The Cheesecake Factory. The service is good, the menu is huge, and the food always tastes great. I have to say though, I was a bit disappointed today during my visit. Of the many delicious menu items that are served here, there is one entrée in particular that I order just about all of the time. The infamous Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich. This thing is killer. I flipped through the menu today as we sat down for a quick lunch, and I couldn't find the darn thing. So then I asked our server as she was ready to take our order and she gave me the news that I knew I'd be dreading. They no longer serve it. Ouch...heartbreaker. So I guess it's on to the next best thing, their Chicken Madeira. There's not too much to say about it other than the obvious, it's absolutely delicious. Chicken breast draped with cheese and sautéed mushrooms, lounging in a pool of their Madeira wine sauce. It also comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. What was also cool was that I told our server that my wife and I would be splitting the entrée, so they served it on two separate plates. I know it doesn't sound like a big deal but a lot of restaurants would just bring you an extra plate and have you split it up yourself. If you're a chocolateholic like myself forget the calories and give the Godiva chocolate cheesecake a try and you won't regret it. Overall this place is terrific.

Sarah B.,"Galt, CA",56,203,61,3.0,3/24/2013,"Why only three stars? Well, here are a few reasons I'm not a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory.  -Their menu. Why is it so big???? I can never decide because the dang thing is 20 pages long, then I forget I'm looking at a menu because I start to think I'm flipping through a magazine with a bunch of advertisements.  -The wait. I swear no matter what time of day or day of the week there is like a MINIMUM 30 minute wait. I don't mind waiting, but at a place so big and place that I don't understand why it's so popular, the wait irritates me. -The service. I have never experienced stellar service here. Not bad service, just not really good service. Sometimes I wonder if the employees are just overwhelmed.  Now it's not all bad at the Cheesecake, their food is good. I don't think I have ever had anything bad there. The food always seems fresh and is well made. And let's not forget the cheesecake. They have the best cheesecake ever!

The apps were brought by some other severs who were nice. Our waiter only came by to refill our drinks and take the menus because we were still deciding on which cheesecake to order. We ordered the cheesecake and he took our menus. He could clearly see that we did not have any plates and we were eating our hot buffalo strips with our hands. We had to use our menus to eat our bread off of. He didn't really help us much. He helped the other tables around us. I looked all around and all of the tables had utensils and plates.

Anthony W.,"Sacramento, CA",408,409,109,4.0,5/4/2008,"This review is based on a few special happenings: 1. You go on an odd time so you don't have to wait in line. I think I was there like 11am on a Saturday. If I had to wait a 1/2 to 1 hour to be seated I'd be outta there. 2. You order exactly what I ordered. I can't attest to the quality of any other dishes. So this review is really for the 2 items I have ordered and thoroughly enjoyed. First item is the RANCH HOUSE BURGER (Pieces of Steak, Sauteed Mushrooms and Onions, Crisp Bacon and Cheddar Cheese on Top of Our Classic Burger. Served with Fries). It was one of the most memorable burgers I've had the pleasure of eating. It was incredibly juicy, cooked with a little pink just like I asked, piping hot when I received it, bun toasted just right, tender little pieces of steak on top, and absolutely delectable. One the downside I added 10 to my cholesterol reading. The second item is the appetizer sampler (""Factory Appetizer Favorites"").  Great way for 2 people to sample a bunch tantalizing little treats. The item I remember the most was the avocado egg rolls. I loved the combination of ingredients in there, including cilantro and sun dried tomatos. The dipping sauce was excellente. Service was fine, no complaints. The cooks were nice enough to wave at my curious kids. +1 I'm a little embarrassed giving 4 stars to a major chain, but hey, my palate must report all good gastronomical events, whether they are corporate or mom & pop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=680

A g.,"Fairfield, CA",31,14,7,1.0,4/1/2012,"My date and I came here and will NEVER come back! My date ordered a steak cooked well done and received a steak burnt on the outside and blood red on the inside while it was already swimming in it's own blood. He cut the corner piece off and wouldn't eat it. We called the manager over who apologized and took it back for what we thought would be a replacement. They brought back the EXACT SAME STEAK WITH THE PIECE HE CUT OFF PUSHED AGAINST THE REST OF THE STEAK!!!! How filthy and unsanitary! We don't know where that steak had been between our table and the kitchen. Not to mention the fact that not only was it cooked to one temperature then cooled to almost room temp and then placed back on the stove to bring the temp up again?? Is that safe?  I ordered the chicken bellagio which tasted like the butter noodles I used to eat when I didn't have anything else to eat, it tasted like poor mans food except it cost $15 freakin bucks. The chicken was doughy with no taste at all. To top it all off we were seated next to a servers station where this tall chick wearing glasses with a gap and black hair. She bitched and complained about how she could be at home right now and these people were getting on her nerves. Then she says thanks for letting me vent, I turned and told her be thankful she had a job and next time I don't want to hear all of that crap on MY evening with my man. I will never and I mean never come here again it was an absolute waste of time and money.

tre c.,"Sacramento, CA",2,14,297,4.0,10/18/2010,"I came here a several months ago with a friend and he ordered some meat entree that started with a ""H""  for me. I couldn't remember what it was called, but I do recall it was delicious. During that time, I didn't want to look like a pig so I didn't finish my meal. Ate only half of the meal. Awww... Although in my mind, I was thinking, ""Man, watch me come back and kill it!"" hahaha.. So when another friend of mine called up and asked, ""I owe you a late birthday dinner, where do you want to go?""  Cheesecake Factory! - since It has been months that I haven't been there and that entree that I had was calling my name, asking me when I'm going to reacquaint with it. Ordered: 1.  Fresh grilled salmon w/ steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes.      -I just ate a little piece of his salmon, which wasn't bad. I came here for the ""H"" entree!!       2.  HIBACHI steak, which had shitake mushrooms, onions, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus.        -Yay! Viewed the menu and remembered where it was on that page, so I think that was the only entree w/ the letter ""H"" in front, and remembered it had wasabi in it. Loved the sauce to the steak and mushrooms. I was nice enough to share the meat. Med/rare, please. But it didn't come out hot or warm enough, seems like room temp, so that was a disappointment. I always liked eating the mashed potatoes from here. But I ended up killing my meal. Woo hoo!! Ok, I lied, left 1 spoonful of mashed potatoes on the plate. boo hoo hoo... 3. a glass of The Cheesecake Factory Cabernet Sauvignon      -I liked this. A little sweet blend. Goes great w/ the hibachi steak.  4. a glass of The Cheesecake Factory Merlot      -a tad bit stronger than the Cab, but still good. 5.  2 shots of grey goose       -what more can I say about shots? Except... shots, shots, shots, shots!!! hahaha.. Since it was a late bday dinner, they came out w/ a sundae w/ a candle on top, singing the ""Happy Birthday"" song.

I was super thirsty and ordered the New Castle on tap and my-oh-my this was super cold and super yummy!!! I love it when I find a place that serves their beer ICE cold.  I quickly slurped that bad boy down.  My gf is not a big beer drinker, and when I let her tasted mine, she was impressed and subsequently ordered her own.  (You can see how frosty their beer is by the metal ""pipes"" if you will, leading to the tap is frosty-frozen.) We got served some warm bread with butter before dinner.  And may I say that there is a lost art of having warm bread served at restaurants these days it seems.  Sure, I don't need the extra carbs (who does), but damn...I love the dark bread and the sourdough isn't half bad either!  She ordered the blackened Jamaican shrimp with black beans and plantains.  I am not a shrimp person, but she said that it was heavenly!   I ordered a toss green salad, to get some vegetables in my diet that day with the house vinaigrette and it was spot on.  Sometimes the vinaigrette can be too acidic, but this one was perfect.  I also ordered the garlic spaghetti without meat and that was super tasty too.  Unfortunately neither of us had room for dessert...I know, I know...i know, how dare us go there without any cheese cake!   I'll be returning, initially for a frosty glass of new castle and then whatever tickles my fancy for eats!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=680

Its layers of moist chocolate cake with truffle filling and even has chocolate chips in it with a layer of almonds on the outside.  I love their lunch selection because you can get half-portions of their pasta for half the price. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and every bite had peas with crispy bacon and creamy eggy sauce. The noodles were cooked perfectly and there was even enough sauce to take the complimentary french/rye bread and dip in.  The hostess/waitresses/waiters are all beautiful here too! They were super friendly and attentive to the tables. They didn't sneer when I wanted to share an entree with a friend for dinner last night. It was quite busy for a Monday night also, and if our waitress went on break, there would be another one coming along to inform us. The interior design is really homey feeling and alot more upscale.

Steaks not cooked properly I ordered my medium well and it was burned on one side. My dad actually had to have his steak taken back to be remade . On the plus side we did get a free dessert but seriously for the prices that customers are paying the food has to be prepared way better. My mashed potatoes and a wrapper in them which I didn't know until I got home and ate my left overs. The lemon sauce for the salmon is watery.

I've been to a few and they're fairly consistent but this one rates below average.  The amount of flies around our table was just creepy  (and nooo smarty-pants they didn't follow us in).  After looking under the table of our booth we realized that the flies were hovering around due to all the snackins that were lying around by our feet.  I can't imagine a large chain restaurant like this wouldn't sweep at least once a day so I can only assume this was from the brunch crowd that came before us. The server was pretty cheesy.  He would probably be fine for a table with a bunch of kids but it was just my boyfriend and I so not really a good fit. On the plus side, the avocado egg rolls were fresh and had a nice crunch to them. I enjoyed the salad, which was micro greens with balsamic, not that horrible mix of iceberg and carrot slivers that passes for a house salad at many establishments. The pizza can take a hike though.

Anna S.,"Roseville, CA",54,210,101,3.0,5/5/2012,"I came here for my fiancés best friend's 21st birthday.  This is just like any other Cheesecake Factory. Big, loud and a ton of food. We came on a Monday evening and were seated right away. We had a party of 8 but 4 of the members didn't join us until desert. They sat us in the bar area because of this (dumb!) My friend got the Twisted Pretzel drink for his first legal drink. It was amazing. It tasted a lot like a milk shake with chunks of pretzels and vodka. He also got a peach drink, not sure of the name. Both drinks were $10. Not sure they were worth $10 but I have to admit that Twisted Pretzel was awesome. We all shared the avocado egg rolls ($9.99) it was a large appetizer. Lots of avocado, they certainly don't skimp. This place is pretty pricey. Most of the entrees are $12+. I have to say though the portions are huge. I ordered the Shepherds Pie. It was so good except not enough mashed potato for the meat mixture. My fiancé got the Carlson Salad. It had a lot of different fruits and cheese on it. He said it was good. He didn't finish it though. My friend got the Grilled Salmon and it was delicious. They cooked the salmon well and paired it with awesome mashed potatoes. It lay on a corn salsa. His girlfriend got the Hibachi Steak. It was presented really nicely. Again, LARGE portion. For desert we both got the Snickers Cheesecake ($6.99) it was so expensive and so crazy good. The top is layered with chopped up snicker bars. The crust is crushed cookies and then it's drizzled with chocolate sauce and caramel. Oh it was so good.  So after a good dinner why did I dock 2 stars? Well.. THE SERVICE SUCKED!!!! It was so freaking slow! We ended up having 2 waitresses because one had to go to lunch (understandable) BUT they didn't communicate with each other so the order got delayed 20 minuets. Our dinner took 2 hours for 4 people. The other 4 of our party joined us as we were eating and had to wait forever to get dessert menus. It was just ridiculous. The only reason I will be back will be for the food... And the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=720

Great plating and they have a wide selection of cheesecakes that you can try, from your basic cheesecake to a chocolate overload. So save some room for that! I've been here many different times for different occasions and each time has never disappoint, when something went wrong the manager was quick to correct it and if they weren't able to, the meal was complimentary.

Rachel M.,"Sacramento, CA",376,450,411,3.0,5/12/2012,"Okay, it's The Cheesecake Factory.  I normally avoid this restaurant but decided to give it another try. I met a friend here for lunch on a Monday, and the place wasn't too busy and we only had about a fifteen minute wait which isn't bad for a restaurant that seems to be very popular.   We were seated in a booth and were greeted by the most BLANDEST waiters ever.  He seriously didn't have a personality or was just having a bad day and didn't want to work.  Oh well.  My friend and I both ordered a strawberry lemonade (totally hit the spot) and my friend ordered the chicken fettucine and I ordered the chicken enchiladas.  I wasn't expecting much since this place seems to have such a vast menu and definitely didn't specialize in enchiladas.  However, I was quite surprised at how tasty they were.  I was served three decent sized enchiladas topped with melted cheeses and a side of black beans and rice.  My friend, although he ordered the half size of the fettucine, received quite a large portion as well.  Maybe that's why everyone loves this place - great portions!  My enchiladas were so good that I would definitely order them again. What I like most about The CF is that the place is huge and spacious.  The menu is another plus because literally anyone could find something on the menu to their liking.  They have a bit of everything:  burgers, pastas, sandwiches, ethnic foods, etc.  I think I may be back in the future to explore the menu a little more.  Even our boring and slow waiter didn't ruin my experience.  Nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=720

They deemed it ok to put charred and dry old chicken in my enchiladas.. I guess because it was togo they assumed it was ok to put that in my food.. It also looked and tasted microwaved because the tortilla had this hard rubbery thing going on..  So instead of relaxing at home I have to drive all the way back and demand a refund..

The server was mediocre and didn't even ask how the food was. The Thai Lettuce Wraps as an appetizer is always the best item for me to get when I go there. I can't complain about the wraps during today's visit because they amazing as always! However, the Chicken Madeira today was really bad! The plate was cold; the cheese was hard; there was little to no flavor; and the whole plate was pretty much dry. I have to say I was not happy with today's visit. This place usually does a pretty good job in attending to their customer needs, but today the service wasn't even that great.

C C.,"Roseville, CA",1,19,2,4.0,11/27/2012,"Went here the day before Thanksgiving with 3 other office mates for a birthday lunch. Now when office workers come for lunch, time is *always* important. With this in mind, here's my review: We were seated right away and Paul introduced himself as our server. For starters, each one of us ordered something different to drink - 3 diff Iced Teas (Plain, Tropical and Green), we each ordered a diff Tea and one diet soda...Paul brought the bread and all but the Green Tea. We were all over the warm dark bread as we were sooo hungry! But after at least 5 minutes, my Green Iced Tea still hadn't arrived and after chowin' the bread - I was thirsty! ;-( FWIW: We didn't receive auto-water, but I'm OK with that -any time-, b'cuz I understand and am a big fan of not wasting water, so if we don't ask for it, we don't need it... period. As a matter of fact, I will look at water being served automatically as a negative.  Paul returns to take our orders, and we ask about my tea, ""Oh, we have to get that from the Bar and I'll have to check on it"". Oh?! You should have checked on it BEFORE you returned to take our order...  Grrrrr....  He leaves and returns with my tea... Paul then takes our orders, suggesting a couple of things, based on inquiries from my friends, and his suggestions were spot-on to what my friends were interested in, which was the Grilled Eggplant sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries.  Feeling for spicy, I ordered the Cajun Burger and my other friend ordered the Factory Burger. BTW, I *rarely* order burgers, but the Cajun seemed to fit my crave for spicy this day...  Paul asked how I'd like it cooked (med-rare, thank you) and got the green salad side with Bleu Cheese dressing. He sped off, neglecting to ask the other Burger order how he'd like it cooked. We discuss how long it will take for Paul to return with that question - another 7 minutes and he finally returns to ask! Remember? We were on limited time...! Grrrrr... Our food arrived, except for mine -again-  :-(   All looked fab, and the Factory burger was cooked to order nicely -well done-, so why didn't my Cajun burger make it to the table? It takes less time to cook a burger to med-rare than well-done, right? No explaination from our server. I munched on my friends' Sweet Potato Fries while I waited....   My Cajun Burger arrived and it looked fab (sorry, was so hungry, forgot to take pics); cooked to perfection and tasted great, BUT, it was not in the least bit spicy. After I chowed 2/3rds of it, I realized the Andouille sausage was missing! Dammit! Too late to complain, so I sucked the rest of it down. But am here to comment and wonder how such a fab place (I *love* their decor and ambience, and their food offerings are quite good) can screw up so big?!   So that's my latest experience, 4 stars, they need to figure out the Iced Green Tea offer and remember the Andouille sausage, dammit... !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=700

I feel like I'm eating at a fancy restaurant without the fancy shmancy atmosphere.  I love that they bake their bread fresh everyday. Drinks are well made as well. Honestly, I have to say this might be my favorite place for dinner because I can always find something that fits me or my boyfriend's craving.  Never a dull moment. I actually try to hit up as many locations as possible.  If I'm in a new city and I see a Cheesecake, I will definitely hit it up because I know what I'm getting. Great place for a dinner date. The line is always worth the wait.  Too many good dishes to name but you can never go wrong with the burgers, steaks or pastas.

Crispy Crab Wontons  (Good but nothing special, however the sauce that came with it was killer!) Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls (Average) I took a friend's recommendation and ordered the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean for my entree and I was so far from disappointed!  Tender fish on top of creamy red mashed potatoes, topped with warm tomatoes and a fresh basil sauce drizzled over everything.  It was outstanding!   My sister had to send back her dish because it was a bit on the cold side, and she felt a little bad.  Our server was totally apologetic and polite about it though.  A manager even delivered a fresh replacement dish to her and the 2nd time around it was amazing.   I wish I could remember our server's name because she was really gave spot-on service.  This CF is definitely a place I'll be coming back to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=740

Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,4.0,3/21/2011,"This review is for take out only!  Our girls' competition didn't end until 9:30 that Saturday evening. It was too late for us to go out for dinner, and we didn't feel like staying up and waiting for a table. We decided to head back to our hotel (Doubletree, Sacramento) and just unwind and relax from the day's activities.  Still, I was hungry, and wanted something to eat. Used my Yelp app on my iPhone to see what was nearby, there was a Cheesecake factory listed. I asked my family if they wanted anything to go from CF, and they did. Also called our the other family we were traveling with, and also wanted to me to get something for them.  Pretty straightforward. Call them up and place your order. After waiting the allowed preparation time, waited at a specially-designated parking spot for to go orders. Called the front desk to tell them I was there, and they came by with my orders. They took my credit card, and later returned for me to sign.  Pretty painless.  We ordered:  -Two Cobb salads: can't comment, it was for our friends, but each was a sizable portion.  -Four Cheese Pasta: My oldest daughter's favorite. Penne pasta with mozzarella, ricotta, romano and parmesan, marinara sauce and basil. Came with a side of garlic bread. True to CF, this was a pretty large portion. Still hot from my pick up, and good.  -CF Club: Nicely arranged in the take out container. Turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. Came with side of fries. Sandwich was nice and moist, and yes, very big. Can't say much about the fries, because the kids ate them all before I could take a bite.  -Key Lime cheesecake: couldn't resist, had to get dessert. Slightly tart, refreshing, yet so smooth and rich.  The Cheesecake Factory's to go service came to the rescue that night.

Oh! And don't forget to get their cheesecake too ;] I'm usually not a fan of red velvet, but it was better than I thought.  The Oreo Cheesecake is reallyyyy good too.

Kari D.,"Seaside, CA",10,108,12,5.0,7/18/2011,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I love ALL the Cheescake Factories actually.I have eaten at the one in Vegas, Palm Springs, Sacramento, and San Jose. But my review is for specifically this location.  I was here last Friday night. As usual the wait times are extremley long, but it was I think, 7:30 p.m and the hostess told us it would be 15-20 min. Cool. It was just the two of us so thats probably why. We made a way to the bar and it was definately busy but we found a spot. The bartender was super nice and the drinks were AMAZING. I ordered the passionfruit mojito and my boyfriend ordered some kind of peach smoothie type drink. I admit, I have never ordered alcohol when I come here, my favorite is the passion fruit ice tea and the boyfriend gets the strawberry lemonade. But after tasting their real drinks, I am now questioning why I haven't ordered them before.  Our little buzzer thing buzzed and we were sat promptly, we got sat in a booth inside and it was pretty private. I normally sit outside but we were hungry so we chose best available. We ordered the artichoke cheese dip as an appetizer and waited to order our dinner. The boyfriend ordered the gumbo and I ordered my favorite Pasta Da Vinci. And we ordered a side of sweet pototoes just cause we like them lol.  Service was pretty good, the waitress probably could have been friendlier but she was still on point and had everything we requested, even when she went on her break, we got a replacement waistress and she was really nice and friendly and was very prompt as well.  Now the best part...the Cheescake!!! We ordered ours to go, because we had so much food we couldn't eat all of it, so when we went back to our room and just rested, an hour later we dove right in. We orderd the one that wasn't on the menu, the Pina Colada. Let me tell you it was the BEST cheesecake I have tasted from here, it seriously surpassed all the previous Cheesecake Factory experiences, it was that good. It had a like pineapple cheescake filling with a custard and a coconut cake, it was DIVINE and NOT overwhelming at all. As I am typing this, I am fantasizing about it now, lol.

It's probably because everything has so much butter and oil that it has to be good but at least it's not disgusting food. I've had almost one of every kind of food from pasta, chicken, burger, steak, to cheesecake. Their cheesecake really is good but I feel like they have cut down their slices in the past few years.

We were given bread, butter, and water. the brown bread (i forgot what its called) is DELICIOUS!!   i ordered from their 'SPECIAL"" menu tonight and the other time too. it was ehhh. tonight, i ordered some kind of steak and chop. i forgot the name, but it was on their separate menu it was $13.90. it said it was similar to their Angus steak, but uhh it was so NOT! it came with string beans and mash potato, and mushrooms.  FIRST bite of the mash potato-- HELLA SALTY! omg.. then i took a bite of the 'steak' and it was HELLA more SALTY than the mash potato. my friend who ordered the salmon that came with the mash potato said it was SALTY too. i felt like i was eating a spoonful of salt. -___- i was so thirsty. the ONLY clear tasting not too salty was the string beans.  the other time i ordered from their 'SPECIAL' menu-- it was some pasta plate.. OH DEAR GOD.. it was HELLLAAA OILY and SALTY! ugh! the name sounded so good, but when it came out i was like GOD! so gross! i am NEVER gonna order from their 'SPECIAL' menu ever again. -- especially from this location. i had so many bad experiences.. the other time i ordered the Angel Hair with Shrimp - $16.90. the shrimps were huge, but there was still the fishy/seafood smell from it. ughh! and the pasta was hella oily. O_O i really dont know why. =/ i felt really sick from all the oil it had in it. their cheesecake is delicious and really FATTENING! i got the ultimate red velvet cheesecake -$7.95 HELLA EXPENSIVE! but its HELLAA DELICIOUS! i think after a few bites is MORE than enough for me! and save the rest for later! i should have really complained and told them about it since i was paying for the quality of the food. ehh i dont know why i didnt?! -_- our bill was messed up. they charged us 3 draft beers instead of 2. and 1 non-existent ice tea O_O we got it fixed so it was cool. overall, this place is very pricey and fancy.  it is a good place for a special occasion to celebrate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=740

During lunch time, I usually get the pasta lunch special where you can order a lunch sized portion of their select pasta dishes.  It's cheaper than dinner prices and I've never been able to finish a whole one by myself.  The cream sauce for their pasta dishes is simply divine, so whenver I go, I ALWAYS order the Fettucine Alfredo or the Pasta Carbonara.  What's really awesome about it is that I can change the type of pasta used int he dish.  The Pasta Carbonara is supposed to come with Spaghettini, but I prefer Penne pasta.  They change it, no problem, and there isn't any extra charge!  When I go for dinner, I usually order the same thing as lunch.  What can I say, I'm a creature of habit. The only difference, I've just started ordering cheesecake for dessert.  My preference, the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  Oh.  Em. Gee!!!  AMAZING!! It's sweet, chocolatey goodness in my mouth!

She asked us for our names and then our preference of a booth or a table. We then were seated right away.  We were greeted by our server within three to five minutes. He seemed nice, but slightly casual and for the most part, was inattentive. He took our drink and food order, checked on us once during our main course, and then presented us with the check--all of the actual food delivery and other checkbacks were performed by other servers. Also, at one point, he spoke loudly about how much money he had made with another co-worker (a little bit unprofessional). As far as the food, it was above average. Not extraordinary, but definitely good. The Artichoke, Crab and Cheese Dip was a great small plate for sharing and tasted great--with big chunks of roasted artichoke. My girlfriend's main course, the Baja Chicken Tacos, was really really good! If you like Mexican food, this dish actually tastes pretty authentic! My main course, the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean, was good; but I was disappointed in the portion size. The amount of garnish on my plate compared to actual edible fish was maybe 3:1. But, what was there, tasted good. NOTE: I noticed this location was rather small compared to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants I've been to. My advice would be to visit on a weeknight after 8:00 PM. I can imagine a one to two hour wait being in place on a Friday or Saturday night during dinner hour.

So if you're not into the eating in the dark business, you shouldn't visit any Cheesecake Factories) The food *and cocktails; however, are really good. I'm no regular, but I've made a good amount of visits to be able to rate the quality and quantity of their meals and drinks. **For appetizers, I recommend either the lettuce wrap or the avocado rolls **For a meal, I don't have any specific recommendations just because it depends on your taste, although, those that I've tried (and may not completely remember the names) have been delicious. I do remember having some kind of pasta and some type of sandwich and burger. **For cocktail, my favorite is Georgia Peach! It's a refreshing and fun ""special"" smoothie ;) **For dessert, Cheesecake is obviously the way to go. I personally like the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake and the tuxedo cheesecake.

They ordered a quick appetizer to snack on while I enjoyed the *free*, warm bread and butter :) ...

My Favorites are the Mac 'n' Cheese Burger and the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Off all the chain restaurants, they have the best waitresses (Who actually know the menu) and alcoholic beverages(I would rather come here and pay $12 for a fantastic Pina Colada than crappy Apple Bees). Desserts are of epic proportions, I have had their cheesecake(original and dulce de leche) and the Godiva Chocolate Brownie(Wonderful!). The Cons: Price and Waiting time I think anytime you go to the Cheesecake factory on the weekends or special holiday, you are going to have to wait.........there is no way of getting around it, its how the cookie crumbles. I have never had their brunch but I wouldn't even attempt to go wait for it(the wait is pretty long on sunday mornings). Its no better at the Roseville locations either, so dont even attempt to drive the extra 15 minutes to think it will be ""faster""....because it won't. The price is pretty outrageous, for 3 adults to eat, this includes :one appetizer, 3 entrees, 3 standard beverages, 3 desserts and tip will run about $110. Add in alcoholic beverages, you are looking close to $140! BUT, If you are anything like me and only eat out a couple times a year, you want quality food that is going to satisfy you and this place hits the spot. I have never left here feeling like I threw away money like at other major chain restaurants, because of the quality your are getting....nothing beats it.

Served with honey mustard dipping sauce.   I was surprised and aggravated when the bill for LUNCH was $50.  One lunch special, two appetizers, an ice tea, and tonic and lime was $50.  WOW!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=780

I asked the waitress if I could get a new slice of cheesecake on a new dish. At first, she only returned with a new dish of whipped cream, I asked if I could get, yet again , a new slice of cheesecake given that the original slice had the nestled up against the soiled dish in the first place. As if my order was so complicated, she finally took the original slice of cheesecake back, only to return with that same slice of cheesecake but now on a different plate. Frustrated, I told the waitress that this was the same slice of cheesecake she told me no it was not. Unbenounced to her I had created a dent in the same slice of cheesecake with my fork to see if they would actually give me the same slice of cheesecake prior. Nonetheless I sent it all back .

Yes, the food is pricy, but good lord man, look how much you're getting!!! Tragically, I didn't have room to try any cheesecake, and taking a piece with me didn't sound appealing at the time. Oh, regret!  The one down side? Expect a bit of a wait. The place makes you feel like you're trying to eat out in Roseville on a Saturday night.

Mandie F.,"Sacramento, CA",528,180,214,4.0,8/23/2010,"""Where is that thing you are going to order?"" ""It's on page 12."" (both of us burst into laughter) Why is the menu so vast? Why are the portions so medieval? Why does most of it taste so good? I broke down and ordered the salmon, because quite frankly they didn't have anything very appealing as far as vegetarian options go, and I haven't really been against incorporating some fish slowly back into my diet. I will probably go another 6 months before eating meat again though. ANYWHO... We ordered the avocado egg rolls --- I HIGHLY recommend these. They are warm and flavorful (kind of guacamole-ish? but not? just tasty so order them) and there is a really nice cilantro cashew (?) dipping sauce that comes with it. At least that's what the waitress was mumbling. Honestly I was full after that and the bread. We felt bad though and ordered entrees anyway.  I ordered the barbecue salmon off the ""Special Menu"" for 14.95 and it was pretty impressive. You get a lot of food for the price and it really doesn't seem like a rip off. The salmon was grilled with a basic barbecue sauce on it, and it came with a corn, red pepper, and zucchini salad underneath, with smashed red potatoes which were VERY tasty. The salmon was topped with some thinly sliced onion rings. Those were kind of bland, so I was dipping them in the sauce that came with the egg rolls.  My date ordered the fish tacos, there were three of them which were HUGE and had cabbage, cilantro, onions, lime and sauce spilling off the top. It came with standard Spanish rice, black beans, guacamole and pico de gallo.  I ate painful forkful by painful forkful, and barely got through a quarter of it before deciding to box it up. My date started to go into a food coma at the table, and his eyes were like half-open and one was starting to go to the side, so I decided we should probably leave and go take a nap.

Miles C.,"Sacramento, CA",125,114,24,3.0,11/15/2010,"The food here is very tasty and the variety is stellar.  In fact the variety here is a bit of a negative for me.  The nearly dozen pages of menu is densely packed with short descriptions and a myriad of choices that make it hard to remember what on page 3 piqued your interest when you are on page 9. They have a pretty serious bar menu which is full of seriously overpriced booze that I've never ordered.  Might be a great place for drinks, I wouldn't know. The decor is outlandish and absurd but in a way that really makes it feel like something out of Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.  There are a lot of styles and textures and pillars and wow all over.  I find it magical at times and over the top at others (depends on my mood I guess).  What can't be denied is the place has a real sense of identity. It's the only place in town that serves White Chicken Chili which while tasty is nothing at all to do with chili.  It's also the only place in town I've seen goulash on a menu.  It's nto as good as my hungarian grandmother's family recipe but for a place not run by a 74 year old gypsy woman, it's pretty damn good.  I've tried a number of things here and seldom been disappointed (The Carbonara was pretty meh).  That said for the prices they charge it damn well better be good. There isn't a thing on the menu that is less than 7.50 and tracking down a meal less than 12.00 is a chore.  Everything in here is half a price point above a normal chain restaurant like Chili's or Applebee's and while the style here says ""posh"" it can also read ""Full of itself"" and not be wrong on either count. I like the place, my girlfriend loves the place.  I think it's overpriced but I also think it has the best variety in town.  If the servers were consistently awesome (they are generally hit and miss) and the prices were a little less crazed (7.50 is too much for even tasty cheesecake) I would love the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=780

Since our group was large, we had 2 servers.  They were both friendly and attentive.  Prior to ordering, they asked if we would all like separate bills, which is a plus.  They kept all of our waters filled throughout the night and did a good job remembering who ordered what even though a few of us changed our seats.  Large groups can get annoying, especially when they start moving around or getting out of their seats (which we did) but the servers kept a smile on their face and made us feel very comfortable and welcome.

Even when it's busy, the two of us don't have problems just walking in and sitting at the bar. I think that one time we gad to wait for a table or seats in the bar area for maybe 10 minutes.  My boyfriend always gets the chicken enchiladas and they are delicious. Not the most authentic enchilada, but still good nonetheless.  I usually try to get two of the small plates so I can have a little variety. I really enjoy all of the flatbreads they have there. I think my favorite is probably the pear and blue cheese one. It is a little sweeter than I would have expected but was still very good.  The ahi tartare is amazing. I was surprised at the quality of the ahi in there because this is a chain restaurant. But it did taste very fresh and the avocado and sauce that come with it are perfect.  I had the endive salad, but it wasn't my favorite. The lettuce has a very string flavor, which I wasn't really prepared for. The dressing was just alright. Nothing special.  The arugula salad was pretty good. I really like that instead of dressing they just put olive oil and lemon on the salad. The last time I ordered this though, there was wayyyy too much lemon juice and it was nearly in edible. I'll likely request for light lemon juice next time to avoid this.  The grilled artichokes are delicious. They come with two dips and one if them is a vinaigrette that is surprisingly well matched with the artichoke. I'm definitely getting this every time I go here now.  The crispy crab bites and the crab cakes are both delicious! They are also very rich and I could only eat one. I would only get these if there were a group of people to eat them.  The Carlton salad is pretty good. I really like salads with dried fruit and candied nuts, but since I had this there I've had a number of better salads like this. I would pass on this in favor of something else.   The lemon raspberry cheesecake is the greatest. It's the only cheesecake I ever get here. Amazing! The service here is always consistent.

Tyrone V.,"Novato, CA",64,287,10,3.0,11/19/2008,"It's always really cold here (AC wise), which is basically the first thing that stands out to me when I think of The Cheesecake Factory. And even though there's a parking lot, it's still really difficult to find parking , since the restaurant is usually packed. In addition to the temperature, the restaurant is very dimly lit, and very loud, so you really need to speak up when you're having a conversation. Also, some of the tables are really close to each other, almost to the point that you feel like you're eating as a large group, ugh... The one good thing about The Cheesecake Factory is their pastas. I love their marsala and pasta da vinci. I don't stray too far from those two plates, evens though there is definitely a large selection to choose from. Additionally, their service isn't half-bad, if you don't mind them not checking on you very often. They're friendly and will check on you when it's necessary sort-of-thing, especially when the restaurant's crowded. Basically, I'd give the place two stars if it weren't for the fact that their pastas are excellent and their portions are huge. Oh, and I forgot to mention that their cheesecakes aren't very appetizing either, which is really sad since the place is named after the dessert.

Betty T.,"Torrance, CA",68,211,75,3.0,5/14/2011,"My boyfriend and I have been to this particular Cheesecake Factory many times. In fact, we actually had one of our first dates here. I remember feeling extremely impressed with the service -- i.e. water was always filled, we were checked up on, etc. However, since that first time, we've been here many, many times -- usually for dinner. Service has been a hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get someone super attentive, and other times, we'll get someone who hurriedly drops off the food and runs away. Last week, we arrived about an hour before closing time and found our server to be...well, not up to par. She rarely checked up on us and just slid things onto the corner of the table and left. I never saw her spend more than 1-2 seconds at our table. She literally just slid things on it and left.

The pasta was super salty. Now, I thought it was just my sauce, but i told my date and they said that their's was also salty! We figured it must've been the pasta and not the sauce. I told the waiter about it and the guy said they would exchange it right away! He kept apologizing. My date already ate two big prawns (three total) and they replaced all three of them. We both got new plates!  The manager came over to us and apologized to us also. I thought that was very nice of them. We couldn't finish our food, so we got the take out box. We ordered their original cheesecake. It was bombdotcom! I love their cheese cake. The redvelvet cheesecake is also fantastic. But if you are watching your calories, you should not come here..

I had the Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms. I would give it a 3 out of 5 Stars on that dish, because it seemed like they tried to drown my chicken in a wine sauce. I would like to taste the chicken not just a sweet wine. However i Selected the Pineapple Upside-down Cheesecake for dessert, and it was to die for! Simply amazing. I would gladly give it a 5 out of 5 for the Cheesecake. I'm a man who loves his cheesecake and I have tasted a many of cheesecake in my time. Also great coffee =)  The service was nice, the waitress brought me my drink in a reasonable amount of time. Didn't like that i asked for a table for two, and they gave me a table for four. hmmmm.. no no in my book :(  Pros: Variety, Peace, Leave happy, Good vibe.

Stefanie H.,"Sacramento, CA",111,230,,4.0,9/23/2010,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all.  Sure, you'll end up consuming more calories in one sitting than you should have in an entire week...but at least it's delicious.   If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory and you don't know what to expect, I'll summarize - above average chain food, delicious cheesecakes, a menu that rivals the great Russian literary masterpieces in length, and an unholy number of calories in most dishes.  If you take the basic sit-down chains like Olive Garden or Red Lobster and then bump up the quality a notch or two, you get The Cheesecake Factory.   My only real complaint is that I wish they had much smaller portions of the cheesecakes, or some kind of sampler tray for 2 or 4 people where you can get a whole bunch of tiny portions of different cheesecakes.  It's SO HARD to pick just one, and it gets really expensive to order more than a few, even if you do take them home and save the leftovers for later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=820
Juliana L.,"Olivehurst, CA",77,84,82,3.0,4/22/2011,"Ok so the reason why I am giving this place a 3 star review is because of inconsistent service staff. There are days where the waiter/waitress is kind and actually seems happy that you are there & there of course are the exact opposite. And I can't even correlate it to a specific time of day. I recently took my father here for his birthday, I was a little worried because we showed up just before 5pm. It took about 30min for us to get seated, we did have a group of 5, but honestly the place was not packed (yet.)  We ended up being sat at a booth in the bar, which I won't complain because of the $5 happy hour appetizers! I don't remember our waitresses name but she was really nice & patient with us. My father & his significant other had never been to the Cheesecake Factory before and it took them a while to wade through the menu. WTF is up with the menu?! I'm sorry but the menu is monstrously huge! I would say almost inappropriately huge. Oh and what's up with the ads? And if you don't have a nice patient waiter/waitress you won't have a good experience. I choose the fried calamari as an appetizer, let me tell you the garlicy sauce they serve with them is TO DIE FOR!! Portions are huge, so it is worth the $. The CHEESECAKE! Again the menu is quite cumbersome even for the cheesecakes. And I do have a beef with not all the cheesecakes being CHEESECAKE. Some seem to be cake with some kind of cheesecake put in the middle then given the name Cheesecake for the restaurants name sake. I love the original cheesecake. The redvelvet cheesecake is so wonderful, but don't take it home if you don't finish it, it's not good next day. I've also had the Dutch Apple cheesecake which was also surprisingly freaking awesome (I was expecting to like it but it went far beyond my expectations.)

The fried mac n cheese, flautas, taquitos are good.  The southern fried chicken sandwiches needs my secret sauce to make them excellent and special. Oh the cheese cakes.....well, I read the nutritional facts to narrow down to  what to order.  The vanilla bean, is mild with a taste of original cheese cake topped with vanilla bean cheese cake, the lemon one is good (minus the lady fingers), the Dulce de Leche (my mom's favorite) is good, the banana one doesn't have a graham cracker crusted but topped with fresh bananas (it's just okay), the pina colada was tasted cheese cake, and rum cake together was pretty good.  Other cheese cakes looks delicious, but if I eat, I'll never live to write another yelp review.  I would like to try one of their cheese burgers or pastas.

Brandon W.,"Stockton, CA",238,231,2,3.0,5/2/2010,"Every time I go here, I go expecting a typical American/fusion chain meal, loaded with salt and other crap like Applebee's.  I always end up liking my meal even when I try not to like it.  Even better, considering the kind of restaurant it is and the business it gets, the prices are actually reasonable. This place is pretty busy on weekend nights - expect a wait.  The interior looks clean, but the floor always feels wet to me... it could just be my imagination though.  It's very crowded and walking through the place it felt more like a packed San Francisco joint than a chain restaurant in the valley. I had the spicy chicken sandwich with chipotle sauce.  The sandwich wasn't spicy at all, but the chicken patty they give you was delicious - a very thick cut of white meat that was still juicy and tender.  The bun t was served in was toasted and sweet.  The chipotle sauce was too mild for my taste, but still decent.  My main complaint about the sandwich itself was that they give you shredded iceberg lettuce rather than a more leafy cut.  The fries that came with the meal were cooked perfectly, which a nice crunch but no burnt pieces. Another guest had the pork chop. It comes bone-in, with potatoes and a glaze.  I wasn't a big fan of their glaze, but the pork was cooked perfectly and the potatoes that came with it were delicious. Another guest had the misu salmon, which I did not try but I can say the presentation was interesting - it was served on top of a thick ""disc"" of rice and edamame's surrounding it like a clock. For dessert, we had the dulce de leche cheesecake and the strawberry shortcake.  The cheesecake was very good - creamy from top to bottom with a consistent and potent dulce de leche taste.  The strawberry shortcake was probably the best I've ever had - instead of serving it with a sponge cake, it's served with a sweet biscuit-like bread and with a large amount of ice cream, whipped cream, and strawberries.  Both desserts were excellent and a great way to finish the meal.

For example: Once I was here with my accountant for dinner and we had just finished our dinner and were contemplating dessert when I could see the manager eyeing our table.  I guess our table was the holdout because he needed to make a 15 top and couldn't until we left.  It is not like we spent 2 hours there, it was about 45 minutes from sit down to dinner.  I felt that if the manager could vaporize us with his eyes to make us move, we would be vapoooorized to oblivion.

Miika M.,"San Francisco, CA",2238,1693,2109,3.0,12/7/2006,"I had just started off a relaxing evening when I was rifling through my mail and found a letter from my ex, who said, quote: ""You have set the bar too high for anyone.  Give me a call."" Ya, right, loser.  So, since my evening was already somewhat ruined by being contacted in that way, I agreed to meet up with my good friend Melody, who was in the mood for some cheesecake.  We decided to drive to the Arden Mall to hit the Cheesecake Factory. My first experience at this chain, was actually when it first opened in San Francisco.  I was conducting a shopping tour with a bunch of friends from Japan and since we had just finished a rigorous utilization of credit cards at Macy's, staying in the same building seemed like a great idea.  What I remembered, was the whimsical interior design and the mega large portions of food. So, a quick zip back to now, we walked in around 8:30 and find out it will be about a 15 minute wait.  The lobby was packed with people, mostly young.  I felt a stab of remorse.  What was I doing in here, when I should be at home, getting ready to sleep and rejuvenate myself for work the next day  ;o) We were seated in about the time stated in the alcove to the left of the kitchen.  This gave me a moment to adjust my peripherals and vision to the dim lit setting inside.  Let me put it this way, if you are here on a date, you will look good.  There is no lighting on the tables, so wrinkles and other non-efficiencies will not be on display.  The dimmed lighting even made me feel good, not too fond of my freckles and war scars.  In addition to the lighting, the dark wood tables and booths contrast greatly with the whirled beige/rose walls and up into the mosaic of swirls and plush rounds of art displayed on the ceiling.  It made me feel as if I were sitting in a pseudo touchy feely version of an Americanized Casbah.   Our server was Donald (who was all smiles and cute with his successful communicative abilities) and after a quick perusal of the menu, decided that my large butt did not deserve anything other than the large Market Salad, conglomeration of mixed greens, radicchio, endive, fresh sweet beets, pieces of avocado and Kalamata olives tossed in their house vinaigrette ($8.95) and a signature pizza, the Pesto Chicken with a dash of fresh garlic ordered as an extra topping (I think it was around $10).  They have a large menu here, so be prepared to take your time, or at least have an inkling of what you and your stomach are predisposed to.  In addition to standard American fare {Meatloaf entree, hamburgers, sandwiches, and pastas, are their takes/attempts at Asian fusion choices, which are evident in their appetizers (Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, Thai Lettuce Wraps) and more.  They even make omelets, for gawd's sake}  Add in another two pages stock filled with every sort of cheesecake imaginable, and your evening is set. I was impressed with my salad.  Huge.  Large.  And the beets were dumped like bombs, red ones, staring at me with an ominous presence.  Everything was fresh, crunchy, and the right texture.  Our pizza was pretty good.  In fact, better than California Pizza Kitchen.  Lots of creamy cheese that strung off my slice as it traveled the perilous journey from the serving plate to my dinner plate.  Pieces of tender marinated chicken, red roasted peppers, and the pesto base was exquisite.  I can't believe I'm saying this about their pizza, it was not expected.  The crust was thin, but not too thin, as the edge had bubbled up perfectly to ensconce the thick topping and slightly sweet.   All the while, Donald was quite attentive, stopping by several times to make sure everything was satisfactory.  At one point, since I was busy pulling the stereotypical Japanese move and fiddling with my new Sureshot camera, we spent several moments talking about picture depth and macro mode.   After we finished, we had only consumed two slices of pizza from a round of 6, which Melody took home.  Our bill, with the two Market Salads, the pizza, two ice teas and her cheesecake, came out to around $43.  Not too bad, considering she used a gift certificate, which brought our total down to $12-15 each. Good reception, good service, and good food.  After rethinking my cruel and unforgiving opinion of chains, I would come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=840

Anthony I.,"Sacramento, CA",13,8,6,2.0,8/20/2012,"I visited this restaurant on April 30, 2012. This was a Monday. I had called two days prior and asked the receptionist what their slowest day of the week was, so as to avoid the endless stream of Cheesecake Factory patrons. Monday was their slowest day of the week according to the woman on the phone. Monday was my birthday so this worked out perfectly. I show up with a party of four (me included) Monday around 5 pm. I mentioned to the hostess that we would be having four additional guests showing up for dessert only. She was kind enough to give me several seating options. I chose to sit at the tables closest to the bar. Our waitress was decent. She got us started off with the drinks. I ordered the caramel pretzel vodka milkshake. (Had I known that one drink was $10 I would have never ordered it. ALL prices should be listed on Cheesecake Factory's menu, not just some of them!) Sadly the drink was not up to par with its premium pricing. There was more than a pregnant pause between ordering our drinks and ordering our food. I was a little annoyed that ordering took so long, especially because the restaurant seemed very empty. Our orders were placed. Again I felt there was an extraordinarily long wait for our food. We were a party of four, and the restaurant was uncharacteristic of the seemingly always busy Cheesecake Factory I have seen in the past. I do not remember the exact placement of events, but somewhere between ordering our food and getting our food, our initial waitress had left for a lunch break. This is where I felt my visit went downhill. I do not recall the fill-in waitress ever checking on us, nor being present when our food arrived. The food itself was good. Always is. Again I do not remember the exact order of events that took place, but the additional four guests arrived and our original waitress returned from her lunch break. Desert was ordered. Desert was probably the most time consuming part of our visit. It took FOREVER to receive our damn cheesecake! Ironically our waitress seemed annoyed with us, like we had done something wrong! Nothing verbal, just silent body language cues. Desert is finished, and the late four arrivals of our party leave. It is now 8 pm, and I swear 2 of the 3 hours we spent in the factory were dedicated to waiting. We received the check... The waitress charged us an automatic gratuity of 18% for our ""large party."" This angered me beyond belief. Our total bill was about $170. That means about $30 was dedicated to her tip alone. I felt this mandatory tip was well in excess of the service rendered. Aside from a lacking in service I didn't feel that I needed to pay more for four people who only received dessert. When questioned about this mandatory tip, our server gave us a very obvious attitude, and told us it was ""Factory Policy."" I work in retail customer service and I know good service when I see it.

They have italian, chinese, mexican, american, and maybe others too. i often find that at these restaurants the food tends to be mediocre at best. I ordered the fish tacos, with mahi mahi, and my lady ordered the tostada chicken salad. I was absolutely blown away by their fish tacos. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the combination of the cabbage and sauce and lime juice made them melt in your mouth. My lady's salad was a bit overdressed, but at the same time it was well put together, the chicken was marinaded or rubbed with some kind of spices and was absolutely delicious.' The ONLY reason i am giving this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 was because of our waiter. I'm not sure if it was because he was busy, or what, but he was quite asshole-ish and came off very condscending. we were turned off by his bad attitude, and it kinda ruined the ambience of the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=840

He told us that he's going to give us a couple of minutes to look through the menu. However, we waited a good 10 minutes for the waiter to take our order.  We did not get our food until about 15 minutes later.   Since it's my wife's birthday, I asked the waiter if they have anything free as a birthday gift.  However, there is no such thing at the Cheesecake Factory. This, I don't understand.  All other restaurants I visited offers a small cake for birthday occasions.   The food is okay, but nothing special. The food is on the expensive side, especially for lunch.

I don't get that one, neither did my sister-in-law. The menu is enormous and a little intimidating; portions are HUGE and kinda pricey.

I didn't eat all mine in order to save room for cheesecake.  The service was excellent our waitress was friendly, sweet and knowledgeable. I had lots of questions about the menu; she answered all of them with out any problems.  She definitely helped make the meal enjoyable.  I asked for things; I got them promptly.  I never had to ask for water.  It was refilled throughout the meal.  Since I was only drinking water, that was nice.   I will definitely will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=880

We waited for about 35 min with our party to be sat, which wasn't really an issue because we (my boyfriend and I) each ordered a drink. Crown and coke, the same drink we enjoy ANYWHERE we go out to. And by the time we had been sat to order we had about finished our first drink and ordered a 2nd. As our drinks came I began to enjoy mine, but my boyfriend insisted his was not crown and coke. He was going to settle, but at $10 a drink I felt the need to speak up. As the waitress returned I explained the situation, she began to say, ""no I watched him open a new bottle and pour it"", my boyfriend didn't argue and she left. He tried to continue sipping it, but just couldn't handle it as he said it tasted like spiced rum. Point blank I tried his drink and in fact it WAS NOT crown and coke and I found someone who actually cared and returned the drink. Our waitress returned and fed the same excuse she did before. But with the return that she would comp it since we weren't satisfied. I can't handle people like that.

The mound of white rice that came with it made me full even faster.  The cons: I came with A large group of about 18 and was not very happy at All with the 85 dollar included gratuity that came on the tab. Call me a cheap skate and oldshool but I thought tips were optional and awarded to wAiters and waitresses that went above and beyond to actually deserve the tip? Sorry, wasn't feeling that At all. Also, some of our party was a little tardy for dinner so when they got there, we had to shift around the table to fit them in. This was after the waiter had come to take everyone's drink orders.    So when he came back, he was extremely frustrated because it messed up the orderS he had alreAdy written down because I guess they were in a specific order. I thought waiters were never supposed to let us see 'em sweat?! His frustration with everyone made ME frustrated and added to my irritation with the included gratuity at the end of the tab. He also was hesitant when we asked him to split the tab for us so everyone could pay separately. Later I found out that the reason he put up such a fuss about the tab was because If he divided the tabs, the gratuity wouldn't hAve been included. Ugh! He made up some bs lie about splitting each tab would take like 5 mins each. Yeah right! Other than the waiter service we received, this place was great. The dark setting And ambience makes it a great place for a first date or romantic dinner. It was clean, roomy and well organized.  Last but not least, the red velvet cheesecake and white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecakes were delish. The latter was a little  (well actually a LOT) on the sweet side but it was good.

The drink menu is also very impressive. Although, there have been several occasions where I've observed the bartender over pouring the drinks. I once received a rum and coke that was clear, as if no coke was added. The cheesecake menu is as delicious as it sounds. I always end up taking a slice or two of cheesecake home to indulge in later. They have a large kid's friendly menu. This comes in handy when I take my toddler because he's a very picky eater. The waiters, waitresses, and hosts are all very friendly, attentive, and courteous to their customers. The restaurant itself is very clean, classy, and spacious. It is a restaurant someone can easily go to dressed casually or dressed to impress. They offer intimate tables for couples both indoors and outdoors. They also offer large tables and booths for larger parties and families. This, Olive Garden, and Chiles are my three favorite restaurants to go to on a date with my husband, out with friends, and with the entire family.

Gary B.,"Galt, CA",18,28,1,4.0,1/13/2011,"I'll start off by saying that you're wasting a trip if you don't get the blueberry and white chocolate cheesecake :) Some of the best dessert I've had. Overall, it was quite nice. The lighting was dim and the ambient noise was peaceful. I went with the petite fillet mignon which was about 8oz, yet I was still wanting more when I was done. I found it odd that most of the steaks came with french fries so I substituted mashed potatoes. They gave me a mountain of potatoes, which tasted pretty good, but I would have liked a 3rd course such as a vegetable without having to pay an extra $4 for a plate of broccoli (thus the 4 stars instead of 5). The steak was cooked perfectly, and extremely tender. The flavor wasn't all there though. I found myself dipping the meat in my girlfriend's Hibachi steak sauce to liven it up a bit. So if you're wanting steak, I'd probably recommend the Hibachi over the Fillet.  We also had the avacado egg rolls which were absolutely delicious. Someone wanted guacamole also, and that was pretty good too. We rounded it off with a nice bottle of white wine for an overall pleasant meal.

I can take or leave the cheesecakes (I'm not big on desserts) but there are several items in the menu that are consistently good throughout different branches in different cities.  When it comes to chain restaurants, even the good ones, I tend to stick with a couple of favorite dishes because I know I will enjoy them. The luau salad is a delicious salad layered with crispy tortilla-like crackers. It's really refreshing and filling (it has chicken, mandarin orange slices, and I can't really remember what else). I also really love the classic burger. The first time I had it, it was cooked SO perfectly -- medium well and juicy! It was a long wait for the burger but well worth the wait!  Another dish that's really good is a pasta dish with penne, eggplant, sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, and tossed in olive oil (I can't really remember the name but I think ""Denise"" is in it).  Service is always really good there too, so that's always a plus. There's ALWAYS a wait though, that's probably the only annoying thing about it.

Laura W.,"Sacramento, CA",48,158,8,2.0,8/14/2009,"The only reason I even give two stars is because I'm in love with the Factory Burrito and Vanilla Cheesecake. But I'll drive out to Roseville where the service is (sometimes) better if my cravings ever get to me again. I went here when it first opened in Sacramento, and it was terrible. Food, service, wait time, noise, etc. Had the plain cheesecake and it was the worst cheesecake I ever had. My husband concurred. Worst, ever. And we LOVE cheesecake.  Second time we were seated on the patio and the wait staff pretty much forgot about us. My husband knew he had to be to bed early that night, but considering we got there for a normal dinner time, we thought he'd have plenty of time for dinner. He had to leave before the food even arrived. We were there for so many hours waiting, I lost track. After that, I swore the place off. But then I was treated to the Roseville location and had the best experience ever. So husband and I decided to splurge on a nice dinner for our 6 month wedding anniversary at the Arden location thinking maybe since it wasn't so new, they had worked out the kinks. We were being too optimistic.  Waited forever. Were seated at the smallest table, just inches from the people next to us, on either side. Heard every word of their conversation, but could barely hear each other to carry on a conversation of our own. Our table was behind the bar where they had TVs playing sports games with the volume ON. It was astonishingly loud in the place. Service was horrible. I ordered the same burrito I loved at the Roseville location, but it wasn't as packed with all the delicious stuff this time. Still good, but they skimped on the ingredients. Our two dishes barely fit on our tiny table. Waiter rarely checked on us and had a cold demeanor.  But what took the cake was my husband's ""rack"" of ribs, which didn't come as a rack. They were individual ribs (who does that??) and had virtually no meat on them. What was there was fat. But they were so bare to the bone they almost looked as if someone had already eaten them.

My boyfriend and I stopped at this location after running errands one day and had the WORST experience ever! We were seated quickly but it took the waitress almost 10 minutes to come say hi I'll get you some water then walk away before we could order any other drinks or even our food since we were ready to order. When she came back she said she could take our order. I ordered a salad and my boyfriend ordered an old fashioned burger. When our food finally came, she brought my boyfriend what looked like some type of sandwich on sourdough bread, and brought me an extremely small appetizer size salad (I actually think it was from their small plates menu which is even smaller than an appetizer) and then promptly ran off before I could spit the words from my mouth that the order was wrong. When she came back 5 minutes later we pointed out that my boyfriend had gotten the wrong burger and I had gotten the wrong size salad. She mumbled something about the burger saying that's what he ordered and then took my salad away. He decided to just eat what he was given and they brought my salad back another 10 minutes later. My lettuce was still frozen! Maybe it was just in the back of the crisper but I always order salads at Cheesecake Factory and have never had this problem. We tried to finish up and get the waitress' attention but it seemed like she was fed up with us already for some reason. The manager finally came by and asked if our issues were resolved and we explained that she never bothered to get my boyfriend the correct order. He said she indeed brought him the factory burger instead of the old fashioned burger. He offered us a free piece of cheesecake and we accepted. We saw the manager talk to the waitress, and the waitress came after the manager left and dropped off the check without saying a word or apologizing to us.

I rarely ever make it to Cheesecake Factory early so I ordered off the brunch menu, which I think they offer only on Sunday mornings. And this was the first time I actually noticed the wait staff all dressed in white - maybe because it was daytime.  I got my usual strawberry lemonade. It hurts to think about it sometimes as it costs almost $5. But I try to drink as many glasses as possible to get my money's worth. So I ordered the French toast. My brother got the salad/pizza lunch special and my mom had the chicken picatta lunch special. I, of course, filled up on the rye bread before our food got there so the French toast was probably not as appetizing as it could've been as it's basically just more bread going into my tummy. But I found it drenched in too much syrup so it was actually soggy. And they gave you extra syrup on the side as well. I should've just split the salad/pizza with my brother, because as I mentioned in my other Cheesecake Factory review, it's just huge. The chicken was alright but I'm not a white meat fan, I guess.

There was no way I was paying for food that the waiter decided to throw away because of his absent mind.

Chris H.,"Sacramento, CA",2,20,4,1.0,6/8/2009,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory on a Sunday with my parents. I had lived in Sacramento and San Francisco both for years yet never been to one so I agreed to go out of curiosity.  We got in and sat down we were greeted with a menu packed full of dentist and plastic surgery advertisements one of which featured a photo who looked like a 1960's version of the Joker from Batman. None of which I found very appealing while I'm trying to look for food. While flipping threw every other page to see what I wanted I spotted the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta""  thinking it sounded good I ordered it.  After sitting there and watching people around us get there food even though there were more of them and they arrived later then us and staring at my empty cup of Coke the food finally arrived. I was greeted with a giant bowl of rice with chicken, 3 pieces of shrimp and what looked like tomato paste.If this was ""Jambalaya"" then I was Tom Brokaw. I have gotten better from those frozen dinner kits you get at the grocery store.  Figuring ""what the hell"" and deciding not to ruin the good time my parents appeared to be having since we don't go out together all that often I left it alone and asked for some Tabasco sauce. After about 15 minutes and asking 2 waiters I finally got Tabasco and was able to choke down the rest of my food.  I will never eat here again, between the loudness, the bad food, the horrible service and the amusement park type atmosphere I was seriously disappointed.  I've had better food and service at Denny's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=920

Now before you start telling me how I should have tried out some local food spots in Sactown instead of going to a chain, let me preface...when you're with a co-worker or someone that's not a big foodie or if it's a professional meal, it's hard to suggest the whole in the wall out of the way ""cash only"" places for instance.  So...on this trip to Sacramento, I was with a co-worker and I thought a safe choice was Cheesecake Factory.  We were seated after a three-minute wait, which the hostess originally said would take 15 mins. even though there was only one other group ahead of us.  I think they just say that.   My thoughts landed on the BAJA CHICKEN TACOS, which are Three Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Avocado Cream,Tomato and Cilantro.Served with Black Beans, Rice and Guacamole.  Talk about ginormous portions.  I would have ate one and taken the rest home if I could have.   Maybe it was a result of the one beer and pre-dinner bread that I had before my meal, but I was friggin' stuffed.

Drink refills are a big deal for me (see: my BJ's review), so when we were getting refills when our drinks were barely half empty, that is means for a good review in and of itself.

We decided instead of ordering an entree from the regular menu, we would order a few appetizers.  That was a great decision because we were able to see what appetizers we liked and what we' will  avoid in the future.  The appetizers made a great meal and the fact each dish was a different flavor made the meal memorable.   We ordered the following: 1   ROADSIDE SLIDERS      Bite-sized Burgers on Mini-Buns Served w/ Grilled Onions, Pickles      and Ketchup VERY TASTY - would order again, but  as good as it was, it took a back seat to the other appetizers 2. CHICKEN POT STICKERS-       Oriental Dumplings Pan-Fried in the Classic Tradition. Served with       Soy Dipping Sauce       WONDERFUL FLAVOR - would order again and would consider ordering two of these 3.  VIETNAMESE SHRIMP SUMMER ROLLS -      Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms,     Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp. Served     Chilled and not Fried  THIS IS THE BOMB!!  Very tasty, very fresh and the garlic sauce was light and  flavorful.  Would order two of these next time. 4.  FRIED CALAMARI      Served with Garlic Dip and Cocktail Sauce NOT GREASY, WONDERFULLY LIGHT AND TASTY - would order again. 5.  SPICY AHI TEMPURA ROLLS            Fresh Raw Ahi Tuna Seasoned with Green Onions, Spicy Soy Sauce,       Ginger & Garlic Wrapped in Nori and Flash fried Tempura Style  BLAND FLAVOR- would not order again.  The description sounded great and looked great, however, from the first bite, the first thing you taste is the sauce and nothing else. 6.  CHOPPED SALAD       A Delicious Blend of Chopped Romaine Lettuce, Grilled Chicken,        Tomato, Avocado, Corn, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Apple and our House NICE FLAVOR and complimented the rest of the appetizers.  Would order again. We ended the meal  ordering two slices of cheesecake and two double espressos.  We ended up taking the ROADSIDE SLIDERS and the two slices of cheesecake home.  We love The Cheesecake Factory in Sacramento at the Arden Fair Mall.  Our server was fantastic, very attentive without being intrusive.  We'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=920

Luigi D.,"Sacramento, CA",52,24,4,3.0,5/29/2012,"Went to this restaurant with my wife today, as we often do when we go out to Arden Fair Mall.  I discovered that if you order from their ""Skinny Menul"" that is exactly what you get, whatever is delivered to your table is ""skinny"".  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which came on toasted bread.  It came with a salad that was enough for three people.  However, the chicken salad in the sandwich was amazingly skimpy.  I'm not exaggerating.  There was literally a minuscule amount of chicken, just a few flakes and a huge amount of lettuce topped with a slice of tomato.  The bread also fell apart in attempting to eat it.  I also had a bowl of lentil soup that was very good and, of course, the bread they deliver to the table is delicious.  I ordered their ""house Merlot"" which cost 7.95 for half a wine glass.  Good, but it cost two dollars shy of the entrée.  Hmmm.  When I commented to the waitress, who was very pleasant, she explained that the sandwich was ""skimpy"" because they have to match it to the calorie count that is given to the sandwich.  Hmmm, again.  It could have stood a lot more chicken, increased the calorie count slightly decreased the salad amount, thus the dressing on the salad and it would have been fine and getting really close to the assigned calorie count.

It was delicious, filled with jumbo shrimp and chicken. I didn't even have to ask for a side of sauce and the waiter made sure to bring me an extra bowl!! The portions are large, so make sure you bring your appetite!!  So since it was dinner, we decided to also have a drink. I ordered the Tropical Martini... I think I have found my new favorite drink at the Cheesecake Factory! It's vodka shaken with passion fruit, mango and pineapple. It was very delicious.  My coworkers ordered Cosmopolitans and Asian Pear Martinis. I had a sip of theirs and it was also good, but I would rather stick with the one I ordered.

Overall, the meal was pricey and not very good.  The restaurant was loud, with uncomfortable seating, and we waited a really long time despite having a group reservation.  I ended up getting sick from my meal there despite my best efforts to eat cleanly.  I do not recommend this place if you need gluten-free food or other dietary modifications.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=940

It's hard to see the person sitting across/next to you, and because of the colorful lighting, somehow, everyone seems better looking in this light. This is a good place to take a blind date because you'll look twice as good in this light :) Oh yeah, and if you're wearing a diamond ring (or something diamond) or wear other jewelry, it shines and sparkle a lot more in this light, so this is also a good place to give your S.O. jewelry because she'll (or he) be like 'Omg he got it at Jared! It looks so great!' Other than the lights, the main courses are fantastic. I especially like the jambalaya, mostly because I'm in love with the pasta + shrimps + spiciness + lemon/lime combination. Don't forget to order a dessert! That's what the cheesecake factory is about: dessert, cheesecake, and more cheesecake. Yummmm. The tiramisu cheesecake is love.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=940
Tiffany P.,"Stockton, CA",149,76,5,3.0,10/3/2008,Went here on a whim with some friends while at Arden Fair Mall. The wait was kind of long when by looking around we could see that the restaurant was not even half full. When we were seated the host was kind of snippy with my friend for wanting to keep her stroller near the table. Then our waitress was kind of ditzy. We would repeatedly ask for things (like more water) and she would forget over and over. She brought our check and I asked for to go boxes. She said okay and then wandered off and we never saw her again. I actually had to ask some guy who was clearing the table next to us to get us boxes.  But... the food is good.

Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9798,55713,4.0,1/21/2008,"It's funny how polarized opinions of the Cheesecake Factory are. People either really love it or they hate it. Since I grew up with it during my younger years in SoCal it's got that weird comfort food/chain thing going on for me. I can appreciate the gluttony of American excess at it's best but there are certain drawbacks I try to avoid, namely the ridiculously long lines without reservations.  How to avoid that? Go to it on a Sunday night at 10:45pm. Now I'm a night owl and all but this is even late for me. However, when you're stuck in the Sierras because people don't know how to got damn' drive when it snows and there's a chain control, you look for what you can after 10pm in the Sacramento area. After a grueling few hours driving slower than molasses, eating establishments were dropping like flies and In-N-Out, TGIFridays, and Murder Burger (yes I said MURDER) weren't going to cut. We wanted to sit down, stretch out and relax our weary selves. Got the ranch house burger with steak, bacon, mushrooms and cheese. Wow, they actually got medium rare correct. Big plus points for that. The burger was huge and the attempt to pick  it up was complete failure, so I ended up cutting it in half and only finishing half.  After that and a few refills of coke, I sugar'd up some more with a slice of lemon, raspberry cheesecake. Since it was a long weekend the place was actually surprisingly busy for that late at night. Lots of high school kids and this creepy dude that sat next to us. Even a bday celebration broke out. Service was good and we felt taken care of. I have to admit I felt pretty darn good about my experience here with the  long day we had.

I guess you're paying for the great ambiance and decor that the restaurant provides.  Their portions are pretty big, but I don't like the fact that there meals don't come with a soup or salad. You would think that it would, considering how much the meal is.  I do love their pastas dishes though. I always get the Da Vinci.  The service here is usually pretty good. But sometimes you can get servers that act a little ""cocky"" because there servers at ""cheesecake factory"".  I think this place is too overrated. It seems like people in Sac make such a big deal out of this restaurant. Maybe because it's the only cheesecake factory in the area. Although I think they just opened one in Roseville.  I would recommend this restaurant, because the food is good. But a little known fact: Cheesecake factory is owned by the same company who owns Macaroni Grill.

Christopher O.,"Seattle, WA",124,65,,3.0,5/18/2007,"I want to give it four because I've not had a bad experience there, but at the same time, it is noisy there, and though the food is consistently good, it could be better. However, don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten there. This is my thing with the cheesecake factory: It's obviously a chain, a big chain that tries to please everybody. I usually hate that kind of place, because it almost invariably fails. Cheesecake Factory probably still doesn't please everybody, but for a restaurant that has so many pages in their menu that it looks more like a collection of the menus of every restaurant in town, I have to say that I was impressed by how good the food was. Not just ""hey, not bad"", but it actually seemed like somebody was paying attention enough to make sure that it wasn't just okay, but that every dish was thoughtfully prepared. This is not to say that my mind was blown. But just about everything I've ever had there has been good and a step above what I expected. The price also seems somewhat justified. True, for every plate of lasagna at the Cheesecake Factory, there is probably an Italian restaurant in town that costs about the same and tastes better. If you MUST have fantastic pasta, go to that place. But if you're going to have it at the Cheesecake Factory, I don't think the food will be offensive to your taste, and maybe a little gregarious to, but not offensive to your wallet, either. It is often crowded and noisy. Their cheesecake? Yeah, it's okay. Pretty good, even. However, I would expect better from a restaurant that has ""Cheesecake "" in the title, but the moniker versus food quality hardly earns the chain of being labelled as a total charlatan (if you can call a restaurant chain a charlatan). This is a place to go when you're with a big group of people who can't all agree on what they want, basically, because nobody will be grossed out. You'd have to be a huge food snob to find it gross. I went here on a date once, and we had some really good food and wine and had a nice time.

Karen B.,"Sacramento, CA",62,87,45,3.0,1/29/2007,"(That's really a 3 1/2.  We need to lobby Yelp to let us halve those stars!) I used to love this place.  Now I, [sigh] pity the fool (yeah, I know) who still feels that way.  I used to visit the San Francisco CF like it was an event.  I sat as long as three hours waiting to eat there.  I would then gorge myself on bread, a huge portion of whatever entree I ordered, and topped it off with one of their decadent slices of cheesecake.  Since then I have eaten at four different locations: downtown SF, Oakridge Mall in San Jose, Valley Fair Mall in Santa Clara, and our location here at Arden Fair.  By the time I moved to Sacramento (one year ago) I was almost sick of the place.  Why so bitter?  Well, like I said, the place is so nice inside it feels like an event.  Thus, many people choose this place to hold birthday gatherings.  Here's why that's a terrible idea:    1. Prices.  If you're the one member of the party who's strapped for cash and want to walk away spending about $15, you're screwed.  The entrees range from $10-30, the average, I'd say being $13-14.  If you want anything with protein, be prepared to shell out at least $15. 2. Portions. The prices match up with the portions, but who on earth eats this much?  If you order my personal favorite Luau Salad, the leftovers are not going to last a night in the fridge. 3. Wait time.  They don't take reservations.  Did I mention I waited three hours to eat there once?  The wait is always insane during dinnertime.  Unless you show up at 11 am you'll be waiting for a while. The warm and fuzzy in me feels compelled to note that they make some of the best salads I have ever had.  If I want a salad for a meal (which is rare) the first place I think of is Cheesecake, hands down.  My personal favorite is the Luau Salad.  I am also rather fond of the Chicken Tostada Salad (though a little heavy on the cilantro.)     This place makes some damn good cheesecake.  I fail-proof order is the fresh strawberry - it's a classic.  Dulce de Leche, though I feared might be too sweet, was divine - rich without being overpowering.  However, I almost feel that they got a little zealous with their combinations.  Some of those cheesecakes really never had to be made.  German chocolate cheesecake?  Boston cream cheesecake?  These flavors are much better by themselves; I ended up six dollars poorer to find out. In summation, Ups: cheesecake, decor, monster salads, Bang-Bang chicken 'n shrimp Downs: waiting, fatty (FATTY!) food, ridiculously large portions, and cancer-causing Styrofoam to-go boxes. Wow, that was rough.  Hey, if you've never been there, you gotta check it out.  It's still pretty good, I'm just kind of sick of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=980

The menu is gi-normous and I've had quite a few things (me and friends always eat off eachother's plates) and enjoyed all of it. Portions are huge as well, an appetizer would fill up most people. Plus, I always have leftovers which are great the next day and give me an excuse to use the microwave for once.  Things I like are the thai lettuce wraps (with 3 lovely sauces but always so messy) and the jambalaya pasta, not crazy bout the rice but love the pasta and I suggest asking for more sauce, they get stingy now and then. Service is usually good, its a bit loud inside, huge and open but crowded, don't be suprised if the neighboring waiter's behind is in ur face (not a good thing). Its also dark and very, very cold. I can't imagine what their electricity bill is like to make that cavern freeze like that. I'm a cold weather person but I don't like a 30 degree drop compared to outside, however, I'm sure the waiters appreciate it.  Lastly, I'm not a fan of cheesecake oddly enough, I've had some, they're okay, but i'm not the best person to be commenting on that. So anyway, a good, solid place to eat! I like it !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=980
David L.,"Sacramento, CA",24,17,1,1.0,3/23/2007,"Seriously, the only Factory I found actually hold up the standards, was the one in Beverly Hills (LA Location). I really don't like this place, the food is pretty much crappy and as for the cheese cake, I would rather go to Chicago for that. Yes! They have the best kind in the US, its next to this Modern Art Museum (President Clinton would fly out there just to get there cheesecake!) Basically it all seems really cheap, the seats and the interior - yet the exterior is unique is different from anything else in the general area. It almost fools you into thinking it might actually be a good place to go for a meal. Thank goodness I called there bluff, icky. Okay. Story time :) I have two younger brothers, and lets just say they like to start trouble and they had one these hoodlum friends with us. Now to make this story interesting, one of my brothers had my dads visa because he was in Dallas  - Okay, so! We open up getting about 4 or 5 starters, plus 4 bottles of Sparkling Water and some soda as well. We get another 6 Main course plates, three of which were the steak (here is where things start going downhill). When my youngest brother asked for the steak the waitress asked him how he would like it cooked. He replies ""Rare.... RAW!"" - Because of his age, 12 years old she makes sure that he know what he is asking for and he replies ""...BLOODY!"" I couldn't help from laughing, there was more to what  he said but I can't remember his exact words. So bad turns to worse, we force him to eat that.... we also had a pasta dish which got covered in salt, mind you they did that. They just forgot they had and it ruined one of there half eaten plates. As this is going on they are spitting up soda all over themselves from all the laughter. And more experiments took place upon my younger brother, a suicide drink. Noooooow, we didn't have access to any fountain drink thing so they improvised and made a really bad mix of something nasty. So he gets peer pressured into drinking it, GAGS and this mix goes splashing all over the wall and table. Let me tell you we made quite a scene. Another funny moment was when they spit wads at drunk people sitting across from us (let me tell  you, I had no part in this) Other think when flying into other booths on either side of us. I don't think people were very happy with my younger brothers.... I laughing the entire time, seriously - it was chaos! Furthermore, they bent the forks and spoons - now they didn't mean to the first time, they were just cheap (who would have thought...) Soda cups tip over ruining more food. Some how I was unharmed and escaped without a hitch. I am sure more happened, but I don't like that food! BLAH for BLAND!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=980

Kendyce M.,"North Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",213,156,20,3.0,8/31/2007,"Cheesecake Factory food is rich, creamy, spiced, thick, oily, hot, noodley, sweet, crunchy, flaky.  I have no idea what I like best. I've had pizza there I think, some pasta dishes, something with pesto, fried stuff, seafood. We had some leftovers, and when we went to reheat the stuff the next day for lunch, it was congealed and resting in a puddle of grease. This is one of those typical Cali places where you could get all dressed up fancy for an early dinner (cause it's an expensive place) and get seated next to people wearing grubby T-shirts and cutoffs (cause they came in for appetizers after garage sale-ing all day). Not that there's anything wrong with that.   Is it true that a person must be 19 to dine here? Or a rumor?

I suggest the Godiva Cheesecake or the Oreo Mudslide Cheesecake.... oh gosh I'm hungry now! There is a downside though I must say, this place gets crazy packed fast. So service can be pretty slow, but they accommodate you to the best of their abilities. I've been to 3 different Cheesecake Factories and each one is unique in their own way.

Heather S.,"San Francisco, CA",38,104,7,2.0,3/19/2008,"This review is regarding TAKE OUT orders ONLY.  I have not eaten inside of the restaurant yet, so when I do, I'll update this review! We have ordered take out from The Cheesecake Factory a few times now because it just so happens that we end up ordering on the weekends and don't feel like braving the weekend dinner crowds.   The website is relatively helpful when it comes to making dinner decisions (you can even see pictures of some items online), the only downside is that they don't list their prices.  The staff is helpful when taking your order over the phone and bringing the food out to your car. As for the food itself, it has always been mediocre at best.  What I mean by this is that the taste and quality just doesn't seem to match up to the price.  I remember eating a burger and a spicy prawn dish with rice - soggy fries and not enough prawns. The upside is that the portions are a decent size and I usually have leftovers. Overall, I would say that eating food from The Cheesecake Factory is a little overrated and definitely overpriced.  The only upside to ordering  takeout is the convenience factor of them bringing the food directly to your car.  I hope that table service is much, much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1000

Seems they always have messed up my order SOMEHOW whenever I go. Of the four times Ive been, my server seems to be either tired, irritated, or just plain rude and lacking in the whole filling up my drink or even passing by our table every so often so I can attempt to flag them down and ask.  Food is your standard American fare. I will say they have a good variety of things that are a little more ethnic, but of course its all extremely overpriced.

Pippi L.,"Sacramento, CA",183,490,38,3.0,4/4/2006,"I went for the first time on a Thursday after work.  It's a popular chain restaurant located at Arden Fair Mall parking lot in Sacto.  They are so ridiculous, they have valet parking.    The wait was 5 minutes, or about as long as it takes to change a really icky diaper, because when I came out of the bathroom with the beanie, our little buzzy thing was going off.  They sat us in a corner, which was nice.    We got the basic pastas at the top of the pasta menu and a peach cobbler cheesecake.  I can make better pasta at home, but it was definitely hearty and good.  When you are too tired to cook and you want 4 cheese pasta, definitely go to this place, but do it before it's too crowded.  It was pretty expensive.  About $72 for two pastas, two glasses of wine and piece of cheesecake.  Maybe I forgot something, but I'm pretty sure it was $72.  We didn't try any other entrees, but the meat dishes sounded pretty good.  I don't know why this place is THAT popular, but they are.  Maybe I have bad taste in general or something.  Hmmm.  My final decision: too expensive for what you end up getting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1000

Plus the dinner was actually decent.  My husband got the grilled flatiron steak and I had the Steak Diane.  Both were cooked perfectly and tasted pretty good.  Portions were generous too.  Now..the bad parts...I felt like everything I was eating off of was dirty.  2 of my 4 utensils actually had food crusted on them which just made me shudder. My other 2 utensils were so spotted from the dishwasher it looked like they were dirty as well.  When my dinner came, the plate had stuff crusted under the rim.  I figured maybe it happened when my food was being plated?? Anyhow, it was just so gross...and I didn't feel like I could ask for any more replacements as I had already had my silverware replaced.  Plus the table looked like it had food residue on it from prior customers, but in the low light and being that everything else with the exception of my wine glass had been dirty...I could have imagined the dirty table part.  Lastly, the cheesecake was very mediocre.  We ordered the classic cherry cheesecake to share.  It came with a MOUNTAIN of whipped cream on top it and another MOUNTAIN on the plate. Really??? Do we need 2 cups of whipped cream with the cheesecake? So overdone it just ruined it.  Plus the crust was super wimpy..barely could tell there was a crust it was so thin.  I like a cheesecake with a graham cracker crust that you actually have to cut through with your fork.  This crust was more akin to a crumb topping at the bottom of the cake pan.  The cake filling of sour cream was ok, not great.  The cherry topping could have come straight out of a can..certainly didn't have the authentic feel of a place that's been making cheesecake for like 50 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1000

I can actually make better at home. The fetticine noodles are a bit odd, because they're green, but the sauce wasn't to die for. It was dry and not creamy. I've also had the chicken marsala, and that was actually pretty good. But not good enough to wait an hour and a half for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1040

Cy W.,"Sacramento, CA",13,148,64,1.0,3/23/2010,"My mother was given a gift certificate and wanted me to go with her. I felt a bit like a food sociologist going to study how corporate food is delivered. The menu seemed to be a 30 page tome but with all of the left hand pages being ads. While I was trying to ponder their nonsensical menu I was blasted with ads for plastic surgery and credit card application information. In fear that betting all of my tickets on the same horse would net be a disappointing meal I picked 2 small plates. I am glad I did because it ended up one of them I could eat. My mother was in a burger mood. The chilies sounded good on one and the look of disappointment and confusion on her face when it came with a side of pickled jalapenos and not the long pasillas or Anaheim that are familiar to so many of us was a bit startling. It was like a dressed up burger and a cheap ball park hot dog had a love child. I cant say that the stale looking tortilla chips helped. My endive salad was a chopped one.... stems, cores and all. Though heavy on dressing, luckily the stiff body of the chosen lettuces held it up. My ""Pizzaette"" was ordered with mushrooms which the kitchen took to mean not to add more to the mix. I realized this one slice in as my tongue started to tingle, not with delight but with swelling. The waiter promptly took the dish back to confirm of its onion freeness only to be told what I had just learned, Everything is premade and only minimally prepared at the time of serving. It would explain the paltry crust on the pizza. I was too sick for desert (and still later for dinner). Looking over the menu I started to ponder the fridges it would take to hold such a varied menu. It must all just be frozen and sent in then placed on a plate like a beautiful microwave dinner.

Curbside Delivery To Go Being my first time trying this, I thought it was a great concept that they had a ""To Go"" counter, along with curbside delivery.  The friendly staff over the phone said that all I had to do was call them when I was close by, and they'd go out and look for my car.  Well, THAT was bullshit.  When I arrived, I parked in the marked, Curbside Delivery parking spot, the car was running, the AC was running but NO one came out to the car.  With the car still running, I had to make another cellphone call, and still it still took extra minutes for them to come out.  ""David"" finally came out, took my $7.22 cents for my slice, which I mistakenly told him just to round up to $8.00, and STILL took another 5 minutes before he came out with the change and Cheesecake.  Okay, okay, the staff here are at least friendlier than Rick's Dessert Diner.  I'll give them another star.  But yikes, I paid $8.00 to waste a gallon of gas?   Disease-Cake Factory has had my brown seal of disapproval since 2004 (my first time was in Studio City).  Dammit,  fooled twice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1040

First off, when the servers were passing out water to everyone one of the waiters spilled water ALL OVER MY TWO FRIENDS. One of my friend's back was all wet. Then, one of the employees came by and said they were going to give them both a free meal. Then, my other friend found a bug in her water. Later on the same employee (not our server) came back and told them that after talking to the manager they cannot give them a free meal but only dessert. My friends complained and said how they don't understand why they would tell us they would give them a free meal and then change their mind. This just shows that they obviously DO NOT communicate within their group or their manager. We then ask to talk to the manager and she came back saying the manager is busy right now and we said we will WAIT for the manager because we were  pretty upset at this moment. Her response? ""The manager is REALLY busy."" UMMM...are you kidding me? We just asked for a manager and you're not going to give us the manager after we told you that we'll WAIT for the manager. In the end, she said that the best she can do is give ONE of my friends a free meal. BOTH of my friends got wet. Thats just not fair. To top of the night our server who was really nice the entire night asked me if I would like a Cheesecake for my birthday. I said I did not want any but she insisted I get one and made it sound like it was a gift from the restaurant itself. So, we get our check and what do you know? I was charged for the Cheesecake. That made me REALLY UPSET! I am so angry at their service and their lack of communication among the staff. I mean, c'mon now...COMMUNICATE with your manager before you go tell customers one thing and then come back and tell them another. Are you kidding me? They need to change their management and improve their service! I may sound really mean but I work in the restaurant business and I am a server myself so I do usually understand but I am really upset at their management here and they definitely need to change it! IF we ask for a manager and tell them we're going to WAIT for one, YOU give us the manager later. I don't care how long we have to wait.

Wow, I thought this was fast, but our buzzer went off in just 5 minutes and we were seated right away in a booth.   The service was average, a bit slower than I liked.  However, the quality of food was just about the same compared to other locations (well, I'm assuming they have their own factory of frozen flavored dishes anyway).    I've also been here on a Sat or Sun afternoon and since there was a long wait, we were also offered bar seats but we waited instead and got seat outside in the patio...right next to the heater.

Robin T.,"Sacramento, CA",23,94,,3.0,10/2/2007,"Usually chain restaurants with extensive, varied menus spell disaster!  The Cheesecake Factory is an exception.  Pros:  The food is fresh and tasty, the portions are huge and reasonably priced, service is excellent.  The menu is not exceptionally sophisticated but there is something for everyone.  The perfect place for a large group to meet and be assured that everyone will be satisfied.  Their signature cheesecakes are decadently delicious, and I'm a big fan of their appetizers, especially the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  The appetizers are large enough to make a meal out of. Cons:  The wait is ridiculous.  No reservations taken.  Boo.  The interior of the restaurant is very hard so sound gets amplified and it's difficult to hear the person across your table.  The portions may be TOO huge... an exercise in gluttony.  I always try to exercise some self control and take half of my meal home.  Lighting is a bit too dim - I sometimes have a hard time reading my menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1020

I had the filet mignon but it comes with fries and onion rings. To substitute with asparagus and mash potatoes they would charge extra? That's ridicolous. I asked for medium rare and it was cooked perfect. The meat just melts in your mouth and did not require any seasoning. It was a good piece of steak. My fiancee had the the angel hair shrimp pasta and she said it's very good. She loves shrimp pasta. The portions are very generous. The price was about average. I thought maybe a little overpriced. The customer service was excellent. Our waitress paid close attention to us even though it was very busy. She was very pleasing. Great time I would go back again for sure.

I ordered Fish Tacos and extra salsa. I think they were out of fish and substituted chicken, though out of a can and completely tasteless. Their idea of salsa is a tablespoon of rough-chopped tomatoes. (also out of a can I think). Eventually I learned that Tabasco was available and helped make a tasteless dish less so.

I recommend the lettuce wraps, Thai spring rolls, chicken quesidilla, and the avocado egg rolls, all of which are $1.95-$4.95 (and you know what their portions look like). Other items on the H.H. menu include multiple salads, pork sliders, and the infamous fried mac n' cheese balls.  Items on the regular menu that I can't resist are the Kobe burger (ordered rare-med rare, how any cut of Kobe beef should be ordered, duh). Also, the Jamaican black pepper shrimp with black beans and fried plantains is delicious as well. I know people complain about the portion size, but why don't you save a dent in your wallet by sharing an app/entree, this works every time for us. I also love coming here for Sunday Brunch items- My all time fave is the Monte Cristo breakfast style!!!!!! The Brioche bread is already pre-soaked in syrup and dusted with powdered sugar- it is pretty much awesome.  Lastly, one out of about every 5 times I come here, I treat myself to a slice of cheesecake (shared of course, they have roughly 1,000 calories to a slice). I haven't tried that many yet but if you go before the end of October and you feel like splurging on calories, the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake is so delectable.

Matthew W.,"Sacramento, CA",89,77,34,4.0,11/9/2006,"I wish I could give The Cheesecake factory four and a half stars.  It deserves more than a four, but not necessarily a five.  The Cheesecake Factory is an excellent restaurant.  There is a very nice atmosphere, created by the dim lighting, which also causes a romantic air.  There is very good service as well.  While you are waiting for your meal, they serve you fresh, warm bread in two types.  Just a hint: if you are going to order a main entree, plan on getting about three meals out of it.  Personally, I go for an appetizer, which is one or two meals.  My favorite is the fried macaroni and cheese.  You are served four breaded and fried balls of macaroni and cheese on a chunky marinara.  When you plunge your fork into the ball, you will find lots of white cheddar cheese and macaroni.  You may find yourself drowning in saliva while eating this ambrosia.  Then, they bring you the bill....  Although it isn't too bad, it's still pricey.  Then, it's time for desert!  They have about 20 different types of cheesecake.  It takes a while to decide.  My favorite is the ""lemon raspberry.""  Be careful about when you come.  During Christmas shopping season, waits can be as long as two hours.  Normally, they're about 45 minutes.  If you get there early or on a weekday, you may be seated immediately.  This place is a must-try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1080

Sometimes it's over cooked and sometimes it's not even cooked. How can you get pasta wrong?! Then another time, I ordered their house salad and instead I got brown chunks of lettuce on a small plate. Usually the salads are huge (can share with 2 people), but that one time, I got a plate that looked like it was sitting in the fridge pre-made for the last week or so. Gross right?! So gross. Other times I get lazy waiters/waitresses who look like they're fed up with serving. Dude, be happy you're serving me cause I am pretty generous with tips.

Big Appetite K.,"San Jose, CA",29,123,,4.0,8/31/2007,"It took a while for Cheesecake Factory to be established in Sacramento, but it seems like it's been a hit w/ the public so far. Although it seems like there are mixed reviews of this place, I've had some good dinners here. They offer a multitude of options, including (of course) tons of different cheesecakes. I really love the dulce de leche chessecake, but that's usually after a meal. As for the meals... Their Macadamian Crusted Ono is one of my favorites, and their various pasta dishes are nice too. They also have a Soy-glazed Salmon, which is tasty. They also have some nice appetizers as well, if you're in need of starting off the meal with something to get you going. This place definitely doesn't cut you short on options or variety, but one thing that I really don't like are the long waits. I happened to have dined here when it seems busy, but it might be that it'll be busy here for a while, since it's still one of the newer options in the area. The service was nice, and my servers seemed attentive every time I've dined here... As for parking, the restaurant is located in a busy plaza, so sometimes it'll take you a while to find a decent spot... But, you will more than likely end up having to walk a bit from your car to the restaurant... As for bringing kids or family, it's not a bad option.

I love Cheesecake Factory, I am never disappointed when I get food from here but last night it was just awful. I order take-out for the first time which was a BIG mistake. First let me say that I was so happy to order from here because I found a old $25 Cheesecake Factory gift card and I was excited to use it because I didn't have to cook dinner. When I called in, I was put on hold for 15 minutes. Being put on hold for that long, I was pissed my mood was ruined. Then finally they took me off hold and apologized and everything, it was fine. I ordered and stuff and I arrived at the restaurant. Getting my food was fine, I did the curbside pickup, they didn't take too long and the waiter was very nice. Then when I got home, I was highly disappointed. My favorite pasta that I always get (Pasta da Vinci), it was just plain awful. There was literally no sauce, it tasted old, dry and it looked like they literally just microwaved it and put it in a take out box. And worst of it all the pasta wasn't even cooked, it was way undercooked and it was super cold! The bread that came with it tasted old and it was very cold. I literally live 5-10 minutes away, it shouldn't have been so cold. I tipped the waiter $8 just to get this piece of crap! I love Cheesecake Factory, it's one of my favorite places to get pasta, but I'm never ordering take out ever again. Seems like they don't care for take out orders and gives us whatever is old. They should have a person that is just for phone call take out orders so they're not distracted doing other things. Maybe it was a busy night, that's why I was put on hold for a while, which I understand  but the food was just plain disgusting and not Cheesecake Factory material.

Zaheem B.,"Elk Grove, United States",104,204,179,4.0,11/3/2016,"Where to start.. well I will admit this is probably my top chain restaurant! I think it's the variety that does it for me, they do several things well. My go to appetizer is the buffalo blast, Its the perfect mix of fried, chicken, spice, and cheese. Its their take on a buffalo wing and I am in love with it! This was also the first place I ever had fried mac n cheese, and till this day it is my favorite.  For dinner I also have several items I enjoy: kobe burger, cajun pasta, chicken madeira, farfale pasta, and the hibachi steak. During last nights visit I had the kobe burger and it was cooked perfectly, but the fries it came with tasted mediocre at best. I enjoyed a 22oz. Stela with the burger, which was the perfect mix to a long day at work. Thankfully I had a little room in the tank and ordered a chocolate cheesecake. The cake was fresh tasting and did not taste like a store bought cheesecake.  The only reason I can't give this place 5-stars is due to the spotty service. Unfortunately it is never consistent. I have had decent service, but on several occasions I have had poor service. I don't know why but the servers forget about you and aren't prompt majority of the times with requests (bread, extra sauce, utensils). On a side note I would also ask for the brightness of the lights to be slightly brighter, but I get the whole idea behind the ambiance factor, but at times I have to bring my face down to my plate in order to see specific ingredients in my food (First world problems).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=180

I couldn't decide between two of them and asked the cashier what his take was on both flavors. I decided to get the new caramel cheesecake which was a great recommendation from the cashier! I asked them if they had a candle since the cake was for a friend's birthday and they gave me one for free. I was so happy I didn't need to run to the store for one candle! I couldn't help myself and I was practically drooling so I ordered a slice of Chris' Outrageous for myself. They were both divine and we gobbled the cake up after singing happy birthday!

Tim C.,"San Francisco, United States",27,4,4,1.0,1/6/2017,"Overall the service started out normal. As with any Cheesecake Factory, busy, but not overly so that their service and timing of entrees leaving the kitchen would be delayed in such a way that would be noticeable. Our server took his time getting our drink order, which he got wrong despite bringing an alcoholic beverage to our table prior to checking our ID.  Our complimentary bread basket was only brought to our table after our server noticed he had brought the two adjacent tables theirs. Once our orders were taken, the wait seemed normal. Our appetizer came about 5-7 minutes after. However, our entrees took an additional 45 minutes to come out. A simple order of an omelette breakfast plate, and a Louisiana chicken pasta dinner.  Our server only checking in after about 15 minutes of our adjacent tables receiving their entrees. Who mind you, were 5-10 minutes later in arrival than us. Our server then gave us the update that the kitchen ""just got smacked"" and our orders were coming. Was that before or after our adjacent tables got their orders?  Once our entrees arrived it was immediately noticeable that the Louisiana chicken pasta had been sitting out for quite some time. The pasta was extremely rubbery, the chicken dry, and sauce had come down to a temperature only slightly above the room's.  Overall, surprisingly dissatisfied at the service. This is extremely rare as I've had many great experiences with this restaurant in their various locations. Maybe it was just an off night, but in either case, it will be a while before I step foot inside another Cheesecake Factory, or at least this location.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=180

Dave N.,"Woodbridge, United States",14,66,398,3.0,6/12/2015,"I occasionally come here with my lady who's a big fan of this place. When we're hungry, we'll literally drive about an hour to Sacramento just to come here. Imagine driving about an hour out of town only to be met with a 20-40 minute waiting list. I jokingly tell her lets go to Cheesecake Factory when I'm not even hungry. It has gotten to a point where I know in about an hour and a half later before we even get inside and get seated and I know we'll both be hungry at that point. You really have to pick the right days to come in. Clearly Friday nights and Saturdays are going to be busy. Expect a bit of a wait.  Onto the food. This place has so many dishes on the menu it's incredible. If you aren't feeling a burger and fries, they have pizza. If you aren't wanting pizza they have mexican food. If you don't want mexican food they have (list goes on and on here). Dead serious here. The menu can accommodate anyone's pallet. I think the issue is obvious here. With so many dishes on the menu, how do the cooks hone in and specialize on any dishes? From my experience and hearing the opinions of others, they really haven't. The food is certainly average at best. The portion sizes aren't consistent each time I visit.  There have been times where you could tell your food was finished along time ago, but with the amount of tables your waiter or waitress is balancing, they're getting it out to you a few minutes later. This may not necessarily be the truth because this place has staff moving from the kitchen to tables, but it's been too many occasions now where the only thing somewhat warm on my plate is the orange chicken. Imagine being hungry for a couple of hours now, having traveled 48 miles only to be told there's a few people in front of you we'll need you to wait a bit, and then you're served average tasting semi-warm food. This has only been my luck here, as my girl's food always appears to actually be steaming hot.  What I feel this place has going for it is the interior and obviously the cheesecake. Their cheesecake is to die for! If your meal is mediocre, end it with a cheesecake and you'll end up leaving feeling like you at least ate something tasted great. I've yet to comment on the general staff here. They're all very busy (at least the times I've been in). You never just see the staff sitting around and relaxing. They are always moving table to table, and going in and out of the kitchen. I would absolutely love to catch this place on a day and time where they aren't that busy to try to gauge the food and wait time on an average day, but I can't make it out to this location during that day/time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=200

So damn good. The sauce they come with is delicious. Fried macaroni and cheese balls. I know,  I know.  It sounds like a heart attack on a plate.  My mouth has never loved something so much.  Every friend I've brought to cheesecake has tried them and you can watch the smile come across their face as the taste hits them.  General concensus : ""damn!"" Served on some marinara,  too good to be true.  Lunch / Dinner: Herb crusted salmon. Freaking delicioisness.  Comes atop some creamy, lemony sauce that's out of this world, with asparagus and mashed potatoes. I always mean to ask for extra sauce but I never remember.  Put that stuff on everything...it's good! Their soups change daily so when you hear the server say ""baked potato soup"" you say ""yes please!"" Creamy, cheesy, bacony...seriously incredible. Drink: Asian pear martini!! It's made with real pear puree so you'll get the yummy graininess of eating a fresh pear. My man gets them too because they're just that damn good. Cheesecake: all of them.  My personal faves are white chocolate raspberry, peanut butter cup, and the sinfully rich Godiva chocolate that comes with fresh whipped cream and a square of Godiva dark chocolate on top.

Rebecca A.,"Elk Grove, United States",66,81,22,3.0,30/7/2016,"Came here tonight for the first time with my boyfriend. We napped after work and woke up at 8pm hungry. We decided to use our gift card we got for here and have a late dinner.  Upon arrival at 9:20pm there wasn't a lot of parking open so we immediately prepared ourselves for a long wait. It was about 15-20 minutes though which is normal.  The waiting area and the cheesecake to go counter is right next to each other right as you enter, so the entrance is a cluster of people.  Once we got seated we immediately met our waitress who greeted us with hot bread and butter. She took our order of drinks: 2 waters and 1 Sierra Nevada(OMG IT WAS $9 ALMOST!!!) My water tasted really weird, almost like the taste of licking your finger after using nail polish remover. My boyfriends water was fine so I just didn't drink mine. I think it may have been something on the cup, maybe some soap residue making it taste a little strange. My boyfriend was ever so stoked to see the eggs and omelets are served all day! He's a huge breakfast foodie. He got a bacon ham and cheese omelet with English muffins and fried potatoes. He cut into his omelet and cheese, small bacon slices, and cubed ham just oozed out of it, it looked so good! He loved his food and was happy to have leftovers to heat up for breakfast. I got the cheese pizza. I have to say when it comes to pizza I don't care about anything, I'll eat whenever/where ever with any type of crust or cheese. When I bit into this pizza though I immediately got a smokey flavor almost like it was grilled? But the cheese had a very very fake taste. There were herbs like oregano and garlic in the cheese as well but it still couldn't mask the fake cheese flavor. Almost tasted like those off brand $1 cheese pizzas from the freezer aisle. It wasn't terrible but I didn't expect such a fake flavor from this restaurant. I asked for ranch to help change the flavor but the ranch was super sweet tasting at first and then ended tasting like garlic! I wasn't very impressed with my meal! Our waitress told us the cheesecake slices were half off tonight so we both got a slice! I of course being the caramel lover that I am got the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and my boyfriend being the Oreo fanatic he is got the Oreo Cheesecake!  Half off was nice and super unexpected!  My Salted Caramel Cheesecake slice tasted like the Ben and Jerrys Caramel Core ice cream!!! So good. A thick layer of caramel just coats the entire slice. Highly recommend if you love caramel! :) My boyfriends Oreo Cheesecake Slice was amazing. I'm not a huge chocolate person but he is and he was very impressed! Overall, not a bad experience for it being my first time! It was pleasurable, however I don't think I would make plans to eat here in the future, and in glad my meal was paid for with a gift card and not my own money, especially after a $9 beer.. But I don't think I would be against going again if someone else were to invite me.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=220

The restaurant is big and spacious. You can eat out in the patio. The restaurant is good for kids. It can get a bit loud; therefore I wouldn't come here for a nice quiet romantic dinner.  Today lunch was fantastic. I was completely satisfied with my visit. Our waitress was Kathy. She was friendly and fast. She refilled our water and bread in a timely manner.  I ordered the Salmon Genovese (lunch portion) and oh my gosh, it was superb. The sauce wasn't to heavy. It help add a little flavor to the salmon.

The grilled salmon and broccoli made me feel like I wasn't gorging myself on a million calories even if I was.  We ended up sharing the salted caramel cheesecake for dessert.

I had the Almond Crusted Salmon over Kale Salad which was missing the salad dressing--  no biggie, didn't need the calories anyway.  My mom had the Skinnylicious Enchiladas Plate-- not sure why she would order Mexican food here, but she said it was okay.  My sister had the Avacado Egg Rolls--  she didn't finish them so I can only assume they weren't ""the best she ever had.""  I tasted a piece & thought they were good.  Our server was really nice.  Overall, dinner was 3 stars, pretty average chain-restaurant experience.   As we were leaving, I decided to order 3 slices of cheesecake to-go.  We got to our hotel room looking forward to tasting them, but unfortunately THEY WERE FROZEN!!  Like biting into ice cream FROZEN!  Not sure why they didn't just tell us, hey these are frozen so wait a bit to eat them.  No one said a word!  I mean, had I ordered this to our table, I'm sure they would have brought me a thawed piece of cheesecake, omg!!   Anyway, after paying $8 per slice, we had to put them in the hotel  room fridge until morning... then we had to checkout & be at day 2 of the conference from 7am - noon...  yeah, didn't really get to enjoy that $25 + tip of cheesecake!  So I decided to call a mgr to let them know about the cheesecake mishap...   I spoke with Diana...  she claimed to be the mgr.  She listened & explained ""see what had happened was...""  yada yada, someone dropped the ball.  She agreed that we shouldn't have been served frozen cheesecake  (""deeply chilled"" as she called it).  She concluded with an apology & a thank you for coming in & thanks for bringing it our attention so that next time--- uuhh, NO hun, there will not be a next time since you clearly do not value or respect your customers.  I wasn't looking for a freebie; I was hoping she would be interested in rectifying the wrong.  For now, I refuse to waste my time, energy, or finances on *hoping* for a better outcome next time...  especially after basically thanking me for throwing $30 of your cheesecake into the conference hall trashcan, haha!  Sorry, but no.  If this is any indication of her mgmt style, then I understand how we were served frozen cheesecake.  Too bad I didn't stop by after the conference to return the ruined cheesecake!  Guess Diana would have preferred that I FURTHER inconvenience myself by driving out of my way.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=240

My friends also ordered and shared the calamari ($11.95) and onion rings (not sure of the price), which were both fried perfectly.

My group seemed to be content with their meals as well. And of course we had to order cheesecake! We ordered: white chocolate caramel macadamia nut, the anniversary chocolate, and the strawberry. The best one was the strawberry, but I like plain flavors lol. The white chocolate caramel was too sweet. As soon as we scraped the parts of the cake that had chunks of caramel, however, it was more palatable for me.

If you want to overeat on some ""meh"" food but don't have the patience for waiting for a table at Olive Garden, come here.  However, it IS possible to eat a normal portion and not waddle away...you just have to order an appetizer as your main course. The appetizers here are the size of a large-ish normal meal. The only downside is at you have to endure the waitress treating you like a total cheapskate. I'm not a cheapskate, lady, I just don't want to be eating the same leftovers for a week.  The cheesecake itself is ok, but not really great in terms of flavor. They insist on offering about 40 varieties of EVERY category (from salad to pasta to dessert) but they don't really do anything particularly well.  They literally have so many entrees available that I don't remember any of them clearly, so if a friend suggests we go to Cheesecake Factory, I think ""yeah, I guess they're ok..""

Karen R.,"Elk Grove, United States",54,46,45,4.0,22/4/2017,"Came in on a Saturday night. Super packed. We had a group of 5 with a 35 minute wait.  We started with appetizers, they were delicious!  The spinach dip & chips is a MUST ($12). So is the cheesy garlic bread ($10) I'm very impressed.  Next time I'll just order appetizers instead of dinner.  For dinner I had the Steak Diana plate cooked medium ($20). The sauce included caramelized onions and mushrooms. The plate came with the steak already cut up into small chunks and a buttery mashed potatoes. My plate was a solid 5 star meal.  It wasn't dry at all, just all around juicy. And the portion was just right.  My mom ordered the Chicken Marsala($19) and she enjoyed the chicken, but she didn't like the pasta it came with. My dad ordered the Carne Asada medallions ($15)  and it came with rice and corn. He also said he enjoyed his plate but he expected a more flavor. My brother has the Chicken fettuccine Alfredo ($20) and it was a decent portion. Clearly, there was no room for dessert so we all ordered a cheesecake to go. They were all a huge $8 slice.  In the end we ordered 4 cokes ($4 each) , 2 appetizers, 4 dinner plates, & 3 cheesecakes and the total came out to $145.00. I personally thought it was a lot of money for a restaurant that super fancy or anything, but again the food was good. So I would totally come here again but only for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary or something. It just seems a little over the top to pay $145 for 4 people to have dinner (my own opinion of course). Hence my 4 star rating. I wouldn't come just to have a week night dinner.  The pricing here is a little too much for me.  Also, our server, Jamad was great.

Parker H.,"Santa Cruz, United States",0,6,2,1.0,29/12/2017,Worst burger I've ever had plus shitty service. Started off ordered a burger and added cheese to it. I was patiently waiting for my burger and was wondering where the hot bread was and never received it. I haven't been here in a while so I thought they stopped serving it but noticed on other tables around me that they had bread. So sitting there starving with just water at the table about 20 minutes goes by which isn't bad my burger comes out and it has lettuce and tomato on one side of the bun and the burger on the other side which looks like a piece of charcoal just burnt with NO CHEESE. I flagged down the waitress told her that the burger didn't have cheese and she said the burger I ordered doesn't come with cheese and I specifically added cheese to the original order which she forgot I did and remembered when I reminded her. She walks away I continue to eat my fries and my dried up burger that no one wants even at a BBQ just sitting there waiting for cheese finally the waitress brings out a slice of cheese on a hot plate that's partially melted to the plate and have to peel it off and put it on my cold burger that's been sitting there for a good 15 minutes and my fries were gone in the process of waiting. So instead of getting a new hot burger she gave me a flimsy piece of Macdonald's cheese to put on a cold burger. I was so hungry I ate it anyway and it was completely disgusting had no flavor and was cold and burnt. After I ate the nasty burger they brought out bread I mean really ? Too little too late. My girlfriend gave a one dollar tip which I told her to put 0 but her pasta dish was okay. I'm sorry but Cheesecake Factory sucks the service sucks and the food is over priced. The only reason why I went there is because of a gift card we had. I can make a burger 1000 times better than the piece of burnt bs I had. I definitely won't be going back.

You go for a bite to eat and a piece or cheesecake right. My cheesecake of choice? The Dulce de Leche cheesecake. Hands down. There were specials there as well like the double chocolate something and birthday cake cheesecakes but my favorite will always be what I order. The waiter was polite. The hostess greeted us and sat us as soon as they could. So, yah. I would recommend this Cheesecake Factory and will probably go there again.  Why the loss of 2 stars then since I liked it so much? Hands down the prices are way too high. My wife and I got 2 chicken plates, 2 ice teas and 2 pieces of cheesecake. $100. $3.50 for an ice tea that we had a hard time getting refilled. So the prices have gotten a little out of touch. Maybe next time we will eat before and just go there for the desert. My second star was removed for a combination of factors. First the restaurant was busy so we had to wait for a couple minutes. No big deal and no star removed for that. But when we were sat we got the tiny table in the back corner that always seems to be forgotten about. So as we waited at this tiny table we were overlooked by our server a couple times. I would have waited another 10-15 minutes just for a real table. Anyway, not too shabby. Just next time we will maybe share a dinner and get our cheesecake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=60

Vince L.,"Sacramento, United States",229,605,159,4.0,5/7/2017,I came to try the THAI COCONUT-LIME CHICKEN. It did not disappoint. It was absolutely delicious. The curry was mild and you definitely taste the coconut milk. I also really liked the shiitakes in it. The only thing that I thought was a bit odd was that they didn't peel the stem portion off the snow peas. Kinda odd but you couldn't eat it. The portions were large and The service was great. I also got there early enough to get a Mojito during happy hour. It was a little sweeter than I care for and you really can't taste the alcohol. I don't normally come here because there is typically a wait. But i'd come back for the curry!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=60

Luckily, they had a 10 inch in the back and charged me for the 7 inch (what I ordered). Today, I ordered a 7 inch for my little brother and when I got there, once again, they said it was not written down. On top of that, they only had 6 slices, so my little brother had half a cake for his birthday. He loves cheesecakes. How sad!! They didn't even apologize. Why don't the employees write down orders???

Jason H.,"Hayward, United States",4,269,198,3.0,19/8/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a okay place to come. It is overpriced for decent food. Dishes are $15 plus and for the taste and quality I don't believe it is worth it at all.  I ordered the Mac and cheese bites but guess what they were out! Thanks, I've always wanted my dreams crushed during the first 5 minutes of my date. Ordered the cheese dip which was good but not $9 good. The only salvageable food this place has to offer is obviously the desserts and even then they run for about $8 or $9 a slice!!!!! That is way too much for a single slice of cheesecake. If you have money to throw away or waste, come here. The best cheesecakes are cookie dough, red velvet, Oreo dream cheesecake, chocolate cheesecake, pumpkin cheesecake. If you really want cheesecake, it's better to eat and then come here for dessert, that way you only spend a fraction of the price.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=60

But a few days ago, I had a pretty frustrating experience. I got in line at the bakery to pay for my pre-ordered cheesecake. Once I got to the register, I was told I had to pay for it at a different register in the front. Given, there was an 8×11 hand written piece of paper stating that is where we pay for it, but unless you really stop to read everything you won't see it. So I went to pay for it, went back to the other register to make sure they saw my receipt and order and then waited. Understanding it was Christmas Eve day i figured it would take a while but more than 30 minutes go by and everyone who paid after me had already left. I went to ask about it and got my cheesecake within less than 5 minutes. Their explanation for the delay: there were 2 of the same cheesecakes sitting out there for a while with no names on it so no one did anything about it. Next time, put a sign where it's visible to everyone standing in line so they know not to pay there and if theres food/dessert sitting out for a while then figure out where it goes.

But we were given a table right away. Our server, her name was Sonia. She was very nice but I could tell she was very busy and at times perhaps even overwhelmed. But she managed very well. She took care of us ok and I was pleased with her service and attention. She brought us their signature bread and butter. The dark brown sweet bread is just to die for! Our food came shortly after.

Terryann T.,"Sacramento, United States",38,71,70,5.0,29/6/2016,"We came here on a Tuesday right after lunch and it was crazy packed! I guess because it is one of the better restaurants by the mall. There was a 15 minute wait but it didn't feel that long.  I ordered the combo Steak Diane/Chicken Madeira, which came with mushrooms, asparagus and mash potatoes. My mother got the Philly Cheesesteak and my dad got the Hibachi Steak. My food was so delicious and cooked perfectly, there was way too much mashed potatoes but they were better than expected. I had mushrooms with both of my dishes so that was great. My dads said said his steak was great as well but again too much mashed potatoes.  The only bad part of the meal was that my mother did not like her cheesesteak, the meat was kind of tough and the bread was as well. I think it was the same type of sourdough that was brought out when we sat down.  We were so full from lunch that we didn't even have room for the cheese cake, oh well, maybe next time!

This was because it was nearby and we did have a gift card burning a hole in my wallet. I'm pretty aware they usually open at 1100 AM. Well on Sundays it's 1000 AM. Lucky for us there was no wait and we requested to sit out on the patio. Both my hubby and I thought this was an awesome choice as we like to eat outside and when it's not crazy busy!!! Yes! Our waiter JT was very laid back but attentive as he came back to refill our drinks without us asking. I chose to eat healthy and had skinnylicious salmon. We did receive wheat and sourdough bread. Both were delish as well as my entree of salmon and veggies that consisted of asparagus spears, chopped, crunchy carrots and my fave green beans! All in all everything was yummy and really no complaints! If you haven't ever eaten at Cheesecake Factory their menu is like a book! We have been here several times although it's probably been over five years I think! They even had a special SkinnyLicious menu designed for those who wish to eat an entree lower in calories but yet have delicious tasting meal. Both my hubby and I ordered from this menu and it was amazing! I actually chose not to have dessert here as I had something else in mind! The reason for one star reduction is outside the patio its view is Arden Way and the parking lot.

We must have driven by this place a million times!  My wife and I just happen to be in the area after checking out a food fair at a local Jewish Temple down the street. Coming all the way from Elk Grove, we didn't want to go home right away. The Cheesecake Factory sounded like the perfect place to have breakfast or brunch on this Sunday morning.  We had gotten there around 10:30 this morning. As you enter the restaurant, you'll find comfortable bench seating on your right, and a case full of tempting cheesecakes and desserts on your left. They also have a full service bar. Coming this early in the morning, we were able to find close parking as well as not having to wait to be seated. This place can accommodate a large number of customers. There were tons of tables and chairs and also a large number of booths. A perfect place to bring the family to wine and dine. This was a perfect morning to dine outside. They have a huge outdoor dining area! There must be at least 25 tables out there. They offer so many different items on their menu that the menu comes in a little book. There seems to be something for everyone! Starting with appetizers and salads, pizzas, hamburgers, sandwiches, soups, pasta, fish and seafood, steaks and chops. They also serve eggs and omelettes all day long, and Sunday Brunch until 2:00 pm. It was nice to know that they also offer a large number of Vegan Entrees! Today I ordered out of their ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" Menu. I had their ""Sausage and Ricotta"" baked flatbread.(Sausage and Ricotta Cheese with Fontina, Parmesan and Romano Cheese and Herbs). ""Only 490 Calories! "" The flatbread came out ""Hot"". The crust was just the right thickness. Not to thin but yet not to thick. Does that make any sense ? Oh well! This was one of the best tasting flatbread I had in a while.  My wife also ordered out of their ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" Menu. She  had their grilled salmon with steamed asparagus, carrots, and her favorite green beans. The size of the salmon was not small by no means. I would say it was a 4 to 5 oz piece. Cooked perfectly. The vegetables were cooked just the way she likes. Not over cooked, but still on the crunchy side. All of this under 590 calories ! You got to be kidding! The service today was fantastic. Our waiter JT was  very attentive and very professional. He took our order promptly and made sure our glasses were never empty! I mentioned to my wife how impressed I was with JTs service . We had to pass on dessert today. But we'll make sure we leave room for dessert the next time we come.  We had a wonderful time today! And will surely be back soon!

Tonight I called my dinner order in (Fish N Chips and the Spicy Chicken Sandwich with Fries) and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I arrived about 20 minutes later and called to let them know I had arrived to pick up my order. The person who answered (Silvia) transferred me over to the to go section. I waited on hold for 14 minutes and not one person picked up that line. I hung up and then called back. Silvia answered again and I let her know I waited on hold for about 15 minutes to let them know that I was there to pick up my order. She said they were busy and she would let them know I was there. Another 20 minutes went by and still no one had brought our food out. I called back and Silvia answered again...I explained it had be close to 1 hour since I made my order and had been waiting for my order for 40 minutes. She apologized and said she would let them know. 5 minutes later a server came out to our truck with the receipt for our order to collect payment before he brought out our food. I told him I was really frustrated because it had been an hour since I called in my ordered and I was originally told it would be about 20 minutes. I told him I had been waiting in my car for 40 minutes and have called 3 times to let them know I was there for my order. The server was baffled that I had called 3 times and proceeded to tell me that they JUST NOW told him we were there to pick up our order. He told me he would go get a manager to speak to me. A few minutes later he came back out with our food and a manager. I explained my frustration about the situation and asked her if my food had been sitting in there the whole time. Neither the manager or the server knew how long our food was sitting out from. I told her that we had ordered fish N chips and that is not something that should be sitting out for a period of time if that was the case. She said she was going to take care of our charges and said I have your food here now for you. We really just wanted our food and wanted to get home. The worst part is that when we got home and pulled the food out nothing was edible. The fries were cold and hard as rocks, his fish was soggy and cold, my chicken sandwich was hard and cold. This told me that our food sat out for an extended period of time, yet the manager still gave it to us. This was all the way around unacceptable!

The cheesecake is good which is their only saving grace for me because the food is not good at all.

I gave it another shot and went to the cheesecake factory for my husbands birthday. We ordered one slice to share because we were pretty full from our dinner at Bandera. The service this time was horrible. Our server acted like she was extremely busy even though it was later in the evening and not crowded at all (around 945/10pm November 2nd) She wouldn't even fully stop at our table to ask if we wanted anything else, she would just pass by like ""you guys good?"" She didn't smile or make us feel comfortable to be there. I was so upset because I gave it a second shot when I really didn't want to. My husband thought maybe she didn't care about us much cause we just ordered a slice and maybe she assumed we wouldn't tip or something. Well we did tip. We are decent people and deserve decent and profession service whether we are ordering one thing or many things. please encourage your staff to be friendly and professional.

My friend and I were starving and borderline hangry when we first arrived. We started with one server but ended up having another stop by and take care of us throughout our visit. It turned out she was training the other server so we were spoiled by a little extra attention between the two of them.  Cheesecake has an insanely large menu so it took us a few minutes to decide. We started with the Tuna Tartare and Beet & Goat Cheese - both of which were excellent!  I tried their veggie burger and she had the smokehouse burger. If you have ever had the veggie burger at Rutherford Grill, theirs is very similar. It's delicious! I can't say how my friends burger tasted but she practically licked her plate.  All in all, we had a very good lunch. I'm so impressed by how well they are able to execute such a large menu. They are timely in delivery, everything tastes fresh and flavorful and is also presented well.  My expectations are low for chain restaurants so it is so nice to have had such a positive experience.

Sarah K.,"Roseville, United States",0,2,,3.0,31/1/2017,"This wasn't my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory but it was definitely the worst experience I have had there. I met a friend for brunch and ordered the Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Eggs, and I asked for the eggs to be poached medium. When the meal came, there were no eggs. The meal was delivered by a runner, not the server. By the time the server came by to check on us, I had started eating the carnitas and chips, which were delicious. He finally came by and I pointed out that there were no eggs, and he said he'd get them for me right away. It again took quite awhile for the eggs to come and when they did, again delivered by a different runner, they were poached to the point of being hard boiled. I put them off to the side and did not eat them and while the server walked by a few times and glanced at our plates, he did not seem to notice that the eggs were cooked incorrectly or pause to check on us. When we got the bill I had been charged for an extra side of eggs. The server took the charge off the bill, but it was something that should never have been on the bill to begin with as eggs are supposed to be part of the dish. We also never got a refill on our drinks.  I would go back to Cheesecake Factory, but probably not to this location.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=320

Jasmine T.,"Alhambra, United States",82,17,48,4.0,5/4/2015,"I absolutely love it here. It was my first time eating here and it did not disappoint. I came around 12ish (and on the day of Easter), so it was pretty crowded. The wait was about 30-40mins. But the good thing is that it's right next to the mall so you can spend your time walking around instead of just sitting there. & they text you when it's time to be seated :)  Okay, enough with that. Let's talk about the food !! ~^___^~ FOOD~~~ 1) Firecracker Salmon --pretty pricey for the amount that you get. ($10.95 for 4 pieces) But delicious. Basically salmon wrapped with egg roll sheets and fried. The salmon inside each did not have a fishy aftertaste, and the sweet sauce at the bottom of the plate completes the overall taste. I don't know if they added the red cabbages just to make it look nice, but I do recommend eating it with the rolls. The cabbage gives that extra crunch that's needed. Plus, the sauce is all over it so it tastes great! 2) Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic --DELICIOUS. It had a smokey taste to it from the bacon bits and the caramelized onions. And the taste of the roasted garlic overwhelms the dish in a good way. The chicken that it comes with was very soft and not chewy at all.  I personally love garlic and onions so this entrée was purrrfect for me. AND who can so no to bacon? 3) Louisiana Chicken Pasta --ALSO DELCIOUS! This dish had a more tangy taste to it with a kick of spice. It tasted like I was in New Orleans! The red and yellow peppers complimented the spices that completed the dish.  Overall, it was a great experience. I'm sad I got so full from the appetizers and pastas because I didn't get to try any of the cheesecakes! & the place is called CHEESECAKE Factory -__-"" but oh wells.

And now that it's in the rear view, never to be an issue again, a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, I've cleared my mind, my soul, and have never been more focused and happy moving on.  Ok, let's talk about the drinks!  San Pellagrino water to start while the bartender concocted my Macallan 12 on the rocks (shame most establishments don't stock on 18/25+, but I understand... $$$).  I usually have it neat but it was already warm there in a packed bar/house.  And so as the condensation wrapped around my ice cold glass, I took a whiff of that sweet, oak, sherry filled aroma only my whiskey can give me.  And once it hit my lips, the sweet burn from the aged single-malt, to the smooth finish rolling from my tongue down my throat, coating it with the finest blend of alcohol known to man... in that moment, in that warm feeling, I knew it was going to be just fine the rest of the night.  And so were the next three rounds.   Alas, feeling warm, comfortable, and now satisfied from completing my mission, ""Mission unfinished business"", I left satisfied, content, and ready to a little tipsy, hehe.  It was the perfect setting to close out that chapter of my life, and as I walked out the doors to see the glowing lights of The Cheesecake Factory, I also walked into a new life full of happiness and mental focus that no one can break.  Thanks again for a splendid time TCF, was very happy to be back in the 916.

Michael C.,"Sacramento, United States",40,11,,2.0,18/11/2015,Don't order mexican food anywhere other than a mexican restaurant. Not sure how many times I need to learn that lesson.  This was my first time to the cheesecake factory. I ordered their burrito which sounded good. I had high hopes this would be a better experience since there is so much hype around this business.  The red sauce tastes more like spaghetti sauce it was tolerable. But what really was upsetting was the rice. It was undercooked which is something I can't stand. I asked that they remake it and I think they just used the same batch of rice cause the second one came out and it was also undercooked. At this point I was too polite to bring it up. I was under the impression that the burrito was comped at this point but instead they removed it from my receipt and then added it again to the receipt. I think they somehow hoped I would see the removal and not see that they added it again. I thought that seemed kinda weird. I asked them why it wasn't comped and she said the manager brought a salad to hold me over and that would somehow make it right. She said she would go to her manager and see if the cheesecake could be comped. So in the end my burrito ended up being 50 % off but was still unsatisfactory cause undercooked rice is just gross.  Here is the good. The cheesecake was delicious but super rich. I am fine with that. I just eat a little at a time and put it back in the fridge. The Reeses cheesecake was delicious. My husband ordered a burger and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will be back for cheesecake but I really think they should treat the customer with a little more respect and quality check their ingredients. I can't say this enough undercooked rice is gross. You wouldn't give a customer undercooked meat so why would you give them undercooked rice.

We spilt the salad up so we both can share their huge salad and we didn't notice until we ate some that their where two huge pieces of brown paper towel pieces In it and we both look bites of it . Super gross and disgusting !  We told the waiter and they both just looked at us and said we will get a manager over . He didn't come until like 15 minutes later ! We already lost out appetites and where grossed out . He apologized and took it off the bill but it want sincere .

Not that we care about bread too much, but all other waitresses and waiters around us were serving bread and we never got any. We finally asked for some, just to see what she would say. She responded with ""I guess I can do that"". We received the bread with the meal, so we didn't even eat it. I asked the waitress to bring ranch with my food, she didn't and then disappeared.

Clam chowder:  Grossly over seasoned with herbs.  Shepherds Pie: Tasted funny. Sent it back. At least the mashed potatoes were alright.  Came with salad. Vegetable and goat cheese pizza:  OK. Herbed Salmon:  Delicate and moist. Came with asparagus and a rich cream sauce.  Also, a side salad that was crisp and generous. Angel hair pasta with a chunky tomato sauce.  Looked boring, saw my brother in law dumping lots of Parmesan cheese on it.  I personally did not taste it. Dessert: Plain cheesecake, no topping.  Only ok.  I am definitely ruined by my Mom's homemade lemon cheesecake.  And Marie Callenders Kahlua Cream Cheese pie. Ah. So, now on to the really good things:   The manager was more than just attentive.  He made sure Mr. B got a good substitution for the Shepherd's Pie.  We packed it to go, since everyone had finished eating and he had nibbled on other things and had lost his appetite.  The Salisbury steak he recommended was decent and worked well for another meal.  Five gold stars for that manager! Luau Salad:  Really great, but way too much sesame dressing.  If there were a next time, it would have to be served on the side.  Ingredients included crispy wonton squares, carrots, cukes, sweet peppers, lightly cooked green beans, mango cubes, macadamias, large chunks of chicken, and sesame seeds.  The winner of all our selections and quite filling.

I came here Sunday for lunch with my family as we were hosting another family who wanted to go.  (IDK why but whatevs) The bread that the waitress brought over was cold and hard. I'm still unsure why she even served it when she said it wasn't fresh but there was some fresh bread coming out that she would bring that back (she never brought it back btw). I ordered the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The salmon was really good; fresh, grilled just right and a nice size for a lunch portion. The Mashed potatoes had great flavor but were a weird consistency. They were creamy but had big chunks of potato in them (idk how they managed that) like they creamed them and then put chunks back it *shrug* ; then the broccoli...deepsigh...It was as if they took the smallest sprigs they could find and gave them to me, they were so soggy ( they seemed like they were frozen and then thawed, and super salty.  Our waitress was ""ehh"". She kept getting me confused with the other girl at the table, presumably we looked alike??? brown skin, natural hair... whatevs... another conversation for another day....She made it awkward every time she came to the table to ask us for something, since we were talking it was like we were interrupting her trying to serve...

It's soft and a little sweet; it tastes well with the melted butter.   My bf and I were just there for lunch. We shared a regular sized sun dried tomato and chicken fettuccine. It will full you up! It's creamy and a bit tangy from the tomatoes. It's good, but not special. But how special can pasta get?  I generally order a slice of Godiva cheesecake, one of the best cheesecakes I have eaten so far. I love dark chocolate, so the degree of bitterness is great for me. I remember the first time I had it, right after I swallow that first bite, I felt a cool feeling in my mouth. It is a must try!  So I decided to try something different, the Reese's cake cheesecake. It was too sweet for me, but it would be good for someone who loves milk chocolate and peanut butter. For me, the cake layer took up too much space compared to the cheesecake layer. It was too rich and too high in calories for me to eat it all at once, so as usual, I finished it in 2 days (with my bf's help)!

The meats are cooked well, the sauces are flavorful, and the portions are generous. Also, the service is responsive and the ambiance is casual, but elegant. On weekends, I come here for the Lunch Special. I am particularly fond of the pizza and side salad special. Delicious, comes with enough food to take home, and very affordable.  My only gripe is that their prices can be a bit steep. Many of the meat and pasta dishes are around $18, which is the main reason I don't eat here more often. Yet at the same time, there are dozens of restaurants I can think of with cheaper prices but far worse tasting food.

I stand there in front of the display like a little kid trying to figure out which one I want to try out at the end of our dinner!  We ended up ordering the Chicken samosas, Crab cake bites, side salad with house vinaigrette and the Rib eye.  The chicken samosas were yummy... but the cilantro dip was a little too plain. I tasted more of the sour cream. but otherwise still a yummy appetizer. It came with 4 samosas.  The crab cake bites were scrumptious!!! Perfectly fried and paired with a mustard dipping sauce. I would say that the 6 mini bites are equivalent to 1 regular size crab cake.  As far as the side salad goes... there really isn't much to say, beside that the purple cabbage should either be drenched in the vinaigrette or at least be separated so it is able to absorb some more of the dressing as well.  The rib eye was fine. It was cooked a little too well done. We asked for medium. But it was still ok. Nothing to brag about here.  MMMMmmm...Dessert... unfortunately, we did not get to order any dessert because I was too stuffed from dinner, but I'm sure it would have been like all my other visits, yummy and way too sweet for me, but still scrumptious!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=560

In my opinion there are 2 reasons to come here the first is the squaw bread you can at your table and the second is the obvious cheesecake.  You're not going to get amazing or stellar service here. It is no longer an mid to upscale place to go have a lunch or dinner because it is cram packed full of families with screaming children and annoying teenagers.

Steph M.,"Sacramento, United States",735,253,2306,3.0,7/2/2015,"Mediocre and OVERPRICED American food. Ordered the spaghetti with meatballs tonight and it was $14.95... not sure how a simple dish like that could cost so much! The portion wasn't even big enough to share (three meatballs and a bit of noodles in a NON-MEAT based marinara sauce...) and now I'm regretting not ordering their Kobe burger, also around $15 but probably more satisfying! Their spaghetti was sweet and the sausage meatballs were OK, but it wasn't anything spectacular. They DO have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu which offers healthy alternatives of their entrees (500 or fewer calories) but, in my opinion, all they do is cut portion sizes in half and charge a dollar or two less than what the original item costs--NOT WORTH IT! The free bread they give out is always GOOD (especially their brown bread)... just refrain from peeking at the nutritional facts! :P For actual FOOD, I'd rate them a 2/5--I've never been ""WOW'ed"" by their entrees/appetizers/brunch specials.  I would recommend ONLY coming here for dessert!! Their cheesecakes are DELICIOUS and they have so many to choose from you're bound to find something you like! They even offer non-cheesecake items including; tiramisu, carrot cake, warm apple crisp, Linda's fudge cake, black-out cake, chocolate tower truffle cake, strawberry shortcake, and lemoncello cream tortes. My favorite cheesecakes are the 30th Anniversary chocolate cake (original cheesecake, fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream), white chocolate raspberry truffle, fresh banana cream cheesecake (banana cheesecake topped with bavarian cream and freshly slices bananas), their original cheesecake with strawberry toppings, and their dutch apple caramel streusel (their original cheesecake, baked apples, and a caramel and brown sugar walnut streusel). I've tried their low-carb original cheesecake with strawberries which is sweetened with Splenda and, in my opinion, if you're going to indulge in cheesecake you might as well stick to the ORIGINAL! Cheat meals are OK every once in a while anyways so treat yourself! :)  For cheesecakes I'd rate them a 4/5.   Our waiter, Andrew, was really nice and gave good suggestions on what cheesecakes to order. He was attentive without coming off as being annoying. The service here is always pretty good! (5/5). I'd rate the overall cleanliness of the restaurant a 4/5, their lighting is so dim it's hard to tell what's clean and what isn't. The restaurant itself is very modern and nice for date nights when you're looking to go somewhere slightly upscale and ""safe."" I say ""safe"" because they have a lot of menu items to choose from, anywhere from your typical pizza, pasta, burgers and fries to salmon, salads, and steaks, and portion sizes are usually HUGE so you can always share.

I mean I love food, love it, plan my vacations around where we will eat, but by the end of the meal, I can only take one bite of the Cheesecake, it is so rich. So far my fave is the Coconut white chocolate one. Easy restaurant to please everyone in the group.  Will say also drinks are poured a little light, but the are kind of $$ anyway so we really don't go there to drink.   Also the service has usually been pretty good, only one bad experience, and I think she was having a bad day, otherwise pretty good.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=400

Tim N.,"Sacramento, United States",233,13,,5.0,25/6/2016,"My friends and I arrived at The Cheesecake Factory on a busy Saturday evening around 5:30. Because Arden Fair is pretty busy on weekend evenings, it first took a while to find parking (I ended up parking in front of the UA entrance). After I walked over to the restaurant, I discovered that it would take nearly two hours before a table would be ready. Because we had a party of 15, I'm assuming that wait time is ""fairly reasonable"" - in the mean time, some of us visited Arden while the others remained to look over the menu. After our table was furnished, we were greeted by a friendly server and were served bread and drinks. The server was extremely professional in demeanor and illuminated our experience with small-talk. Some of my friends ordered sole cheesecake, while others ordered pasta and I ordered the Steak Diane - with such an array of menu options, the worst part of our experience was deciding which plate to order. After consuming the provided bread, our entrees were delivered in a timely manner. My stead was cooked well, but the entire dish was sitting in a pool of steak sauce, which was somewhat overwhelming. As we ate our meals, our waiter checked in periodically to ensure that everything was going smoothly and even bagged our plates to-go at the end of the meal. Overall, the experience is definitely worth the price - with the whole ""a little extra goes a long way"" mentality - and it is safe to say that I will be returning shortly.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=460

Service- Our server was so polite just a very nice person and so attentive and right on every point! We didn't have to wait for anything he was always right there, if he had to come back he would explain really quick that he would be back in one minute, he was very attentive to all his tables and let me tell you this place was packed wall to wall. Drinks- We ordered a few Shirly Temples and water and they came right away no wait time at all. Appetizer- We got the Fried Mozzarella. It came out nicely plated, golden brown, crispy, hot, cheese fully melted and served with Marinara Sauce. Very delicious! I want more just thinking about it. Food- I ordered the Grilled Chicken & Avacado Club. All their food was big portions so you won't be leaving there hungry. My Club Sandwich was the best I ever had. Nice juicy grilled chicken breast, bacon, lettuce, tomatoe and avacado on golden brown grilled bread. Oh so good I'm still snacking on the other half. You can have salad or fries I got the salad with blue cheese dressing.  Dessert- I got the cheese cake topped with cherries and whipped cream that was really good but I already knew it was going to be.  The restaraunt is gorgeous inside from wall decor, paintings on the ceilings and statues, seating area is very nice, the bar is huge and I like how they place the alcohol up the wall to almost the ceiling.

We've all heard that the Cheesecake Factory is an excellent place to eat at and the food is super delicious. But my hubby and i's experience really tells a different story.  My hubby and I got to the restaurant at around dinner time, but we were seated rather quickly. We were given our complimentary bread and butter quickly, along with our drinks, which we decided to have just water.  Our waiter was really nice and quick at getting our orders down, without much deciding I decided to order the chicken bellagio while my husband decided to get the Kobe beef burger FIRST. The waiter left with our orders, but with some more deciding he decided to go with the fried mac and cheese burger (medium rare). He chased down the waiter and asked for a change, which our waiter did right away.  The wait for the food was sort of long, but we weren't upset because we had already expected the wait and we had our bread to munch on while we waited. My husbands food came out first, and then mine took a little while to come out after.  At first bite I wasn't too satisfied with the pasta, it was sort of dry and all stuck together, it didn't seem like it was fresh or that it was heated up all the way. My husband was also not satisfied with his burger, being super picky with his burgers, this one was cooked very well done, but he asked for it to be medium rare. We sent the burger back, but not the pasta because I'm less picky than he is.  The new burger was taking sort of long, but I think our waiter sensed that we were getting irritated because he offered us some soup. He also kept us updated on the burger and how much more we had to wait on it.  When his second burger finally came out though, it was perfect. Although on the negative side, we were both so full from the fries and soup and bread that we couldn't even finish our foods. I ended up eating only half of the portion that was on my plate. And my husband also ate just half of his burger. We ended up deciding to take it all to go, but I was displeased that our food wasn't boxed for us, and that we had to do it ourselves.  Overall our experience at the Cheesecake Factory was not such a pleasing one. Our food took forever to come, it wasn't fresh, we had to send one plate back, the wait was forever and in the end, we didn't even feel like trying some of their cheesecake. But if you guys ever do need somewhere fancy to take your family or friends, the Cheesecake Factory may be a good option, because I've heard that in Asia mostly, this placed is very well known. :^)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=260

Nhi T.,"San Jose, United States",190,37,23,2.0,16/4/2016,"My sibs and I love having an occasional dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. We don't come often but normally the service is good. Friendly people who do a nice job at serving and meeting our needs. I.  Last night, we went as a party of 8 around 920PM. 5 adults and 3 kids. Waited about 30 minutes for a table. Our server was a man named Timothy. We got seated and he took our drink orders as well as our food orders. Since we were a party of 8, our table was really long. Timothy stood on one end of the table trying to take my sister's order (who was sitting on the other end), and she was literally yelling over the background chatter of the restaurant. He finally walks over to that side of the table to take their orders. Shouldn't it be common sense to move to the other end so people aren't shouting across the table?  Anyway, Tried to order my usual dish (chicken chipotle pasta with their Louisiana chicken instead of the honey glazed chicken) but he insisted that they don't allow the substitution at all because it's ""two completely different dishes"". I gave up, I didn't want to waste breath over a chicken substitution so I just ordered it regular. But we requested for the 3 kids meals to be prepared first and brought out as soon as they were done.  When he brought out the drinks, one of the cups knocked over and spilled all over the table. Our waiter said he'd be back with a towel to wipe it off. 10mins pass and we made do with cleaning the spill with our own napkins. A table busser comes to clean the table NEXT to ours. Our waiter talks to the busser and they come over to our table to address the spill (that we cleaned ourselves 10mins ago). We told them we didn't need cleaning anymore. Fast forward to 10:30pm. No food in sight yet. No appetizers or kids food. Kids were getting sleepy waiting and munching on the complimentary bread.  10:40. Food finally arrives and all of the food came out at once. One of the kids ordered a cheese quesadilla but they made a chicken quesadilla. He was hungry so I didn't want to hassle our server in correcting the order since food took so long to come out in the first place. The food tasted good as it normally did. Our waiter never brought us paper napkins that we requested. And when it was time for the food boxing (past experiences, my waiters have 100% always brought the good back to be packed and brought it back to our table) he gave us 5 boxes to do it ourselves, and only one small bag. I don't know what the logic in that was.  Overall it was the worse service we've ever had here and we've been going occasionally for as long as I can remember.

Place was clean and welcoming, but it was FREEZING inside. Just because it's hot outside doesn't mean it should be the exact opposite inside folks.  My margarita tasted like a big glass of overly sweetened lemonade. The tossed salad had several very bitter pieces of lettuce; I didn't even finish it. The main entree of herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes, and asparagus was very disappointing. To start with the presentation (not that I care so much about that) looked like the Facehugger alien from the movie ""Alien.""  A big piece of black salmon over the mashed potatoes with long, green asparagus sprouting out like tentacles. I told the server the presentation was BIZARRE.  Food-wise, the dish was not as hot as it should have been (Why won't restaurants learn that details count?!). The salmon was almost black from the herbs. The asparagus was too big (asparagus should be thin and slightly crunchy, not big and mushy). And they put some kind of cream sauce with it all (??). Why we'd need a cream sauce I don't know.  Entire bill with 15% tip (service was good), $46!!!! Yeah.

Table count:4. The positive. As I mentioned the wait was reasonable and the young man at front was very polite and courteous.  Our food consisted of a salad, the salmon dish and a shepherds pie for yours truly.  Each and every dish was impeccable, tasty and worth every bite.  I like to think that a good dish means less to take home.  We did not need any boxing today. The unfortunate:  I understand completely packed restaurants and hundreds of seated patrons with dozens more on the wings waiting patiently.  But table service was not what I had hoped at today at The Cheesecake Factory.  The water came out fine and in a few minutes,  we had to ask then wait over 10 minutes for the first batch of bread which has three loaves and was ok.  20 minutes later no follow up service and we had to ask for more bread which only brought 2 loaves and was more stale than a piece of croutons. The last positive was the drinks, pineapple Mojito's and typhoon punches.  Definitely hats off to the bartender.  Kind of made up for other aspects.   This is I think was a one off I generally have great experiences.  HAPPY DINING Yelpers.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=260

My food was burned and when I brought it to my servers attention she didn't seem bothered by it. She came back about 3 minutes later with a small plate and said her manager wanted to her to remove the burned food from my plate. They didn't offer me a new plate, just to bring me a few pieces of sausage. Then they said they would take off a cheesecake off my bill, but did not. We spent $73 that day for 2 people, and they didn't care about the food they served me.

Which is why I deducted a star. Maybe I'm too observant but I notice that when she finishes up serving the tables around us and has to make her away pass us, shed avoid us like the plague. There were no ""how do you guys like the food?"" or ""do you guys need anything?"" or ""if you need anything let me know."" None of that whatsoever. Therefore asking for my extra ranch seemed like such a burden.  I ordered a factory burger that came out okay. I made a mistake by not mentioning what bread I'd like so instead it came out with a baguette. No foul. A friendly server in a restaurant like this one is key to me.

I been to cheesecake factory many many times, and I have not tried everything on their menu. (+1 star) However, I love the dessert menu.

But the managers were awful and made us feel like they didn't want us there. I asked for a booth because I was with my toddler son and they were not really interested in accommodating us although it wasn't that busy and it took a long time to get the table we needed. Then we did order cheesecake, and it was 1 to 1 and 1/2 inches wide at the widest part, about a quarter of the serving compared to all the other Cheesecake restaurants I've been to. Yes, it's rich, but that's why we had half of the slice put in a box to go. But when I saw it was so much smaller than the servings at the other restaurants, I shouldn't have bothered.  I'm talking 2 or 3 bites and you are done with half of it... . Very, very disappointing.

Alison W.,"San Jose, United States",413,1590,952,3.0,2/6/2009,"I remember what a big deal it was when this location first opened at Arden Fair - crazy busy. And my mom usually hates crowded American places. But we had a gift certificate so decided to hit it up. We were actually seated right away so that's a plus. I rarely ever make it to Cheesecake Factory early so I ordered off the brunch menu, which I think they offer only on Sunday mornings. And this was the first time I actually noticed the wait staff all dressed in white - maybe because it was daytime.  I got my usual strawberry lemonade. It hurts to think about it sometimes as it costs almost $5. But I try to drink as many glasses as possible to get my money's worth. So I ordered the French toast. My brother got the salad/pizza lunch special and my mom had the chicken picatta lunch special. I, of course, filled up on the rye bread before our food got there so the French toast was probably not as appetizing as it could've been as it's basically just more bread going into my tummy. But I found it drenched in too much syrup so it was actually soggy. And they gave you extra syrup on the side as well. I should've just split the salad/pizza with my brother, because as I mentioned in my other Cheesecake Factory review, it's just huge. The chicken was alright but I'm not a white meat fan, I guess. We were stuffed but had to top it all off with a slice of cheesecake. My mom isn't a fan of the fancy ones so we just got the plain fresh strawberry topped ones.

There was no way I was paying for food that the waiter decided to throw away because of his absent mind. We brought this mistake to his attention and his response was that he didn't know what happened. Time was going by and it was time to go now, so we simply refused to pay for what we didn't eat, however, we should not have had to be the ones to tell them this, the manager should have comped  it at his own discretion.

Then, one of the employees came by and said they were going to give them both a free meal. Then, my other friend found a bug in her water. Later on the same employee (not our server) came back and told them that after talking to the manager they cannot give them a free meal but only dessert. My friends complained and said how they don't understand why they would tell us they would give them a free meal and then change their mind. This just shows that they obviously DO NOT communicate within their group or their manager. We then ask to talk to the manager and she came back saying the manager is busy right now and we said we will WAIT for the manager because we were  pretty upset at this moment. Her response? ""The manager is REALLY busy."" UMMM...are you kidding me? We just asked for a manager and you're not going to give us the manager after we told you that we'll WAIT for the manager. In the end, she said that the best she can do is give ONE of my friends a free meal. BOTH of my friends got wet. Thats just not fair. To top of the night our server who was really nice the entire night asked me if I would like a Cheesecake for my birthday. I said I did not want any but she insisted I get one and made it sound like it was a gift from the restaurant itself. So, we get our check and what do you know? I was charged for the Cheesecake. That made me REALLY UPSET! I am so angry at their service and their lack of communication among the staff. I mean, c'mon now...COMMUNICATE with your manager before you go tell customers one thing and then come back and tell them another. Are you kidding me? They need to change their management and improve their service! I may sound really mean but I work in the restaurant business and I am a server myself so I do usually understand but I am really upset at their management here and they definitely need to change it! IF we ask for a manager and tell them we're going to WAIT for one, YOU give us the manager later. I don't care how long we have to wait. Customer service should be priority and they definitely failed at delivering that. OH! & They kept offering Cheesecake Factory shirts after we said no so many times...umm NO! We DO NOT WANT TO ADVERTISE YOUR RESTAURANT AFTER YOUR HORRIBLE SERVICE & COMMUNICATION! DONT COME HERE!!!! Eat at another CHEESECAKE factory!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1060

judy l.,"San Francisco, United States",4,114,9,4.0,28/1/2008,"I've been to this location at least 5 or 6 times between last year and the beginning bit of this year.  Cheesecake Factory is a good place to bring anyone because their menu is wide and has lots of variety.  The portions are huge and if you can eat 1 whole dish, you either have a GIGANTIC stomach or you were really really really hungry.  They also have lunch sized portions of some of their dishes if you arrive before 3 or 4pm...I can't remember.   Some people have mentioned they hated the wait....let me tell you, if you have ever EVER EVER been to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco on a Friday night, it's like all hell broke loose!!!  Seriously, the wait in the SF location can be anywhere from 1-3 hours just for a small party (on a friday evening), sometimes even having a 1 hr. wait just for the buzzer thing.  There are hoards and hoards of people just standing around waiting and it is so crowded that sometimes it is hard to get onto the elevator.  *sigh* So when I found out of the Cheesecake in Sac, I had to come try it and enjoy some of my favorite dishes.  I believe Cheesecake makes the best calamari I have eaten in my life!   The most recent time, I stopped in on a Friday night around 7:30pm, there was a small crowd waiting on the benches and around the display of cheesecakes, asked for the wait time for 2 and they told me about 15 minutes.  WOOHOO!  just 15 minutes?! Wow, I thought this was fast, but our buzzer went off in just 5 minutes and we were seated right away in a booth.   The service was average, a bit slower than I liked.  However, the quality of food was just about the same compared to other locations (well, I'm assuming they have their own factory of frozen flavored dishes anyway).    I've also been here on a Sat or Sun afternoon and since there was a long wait, we were also offered bar seats but we waited instead and got seat outside in the patio...right next to the heater. I've never had any problems eating at this specific location and think the waitstaff is great.  I will return....to eat some yummy calamari!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1060

Enough about the food though.  The atmosphere is dark and loud.  The place can be really really busy, especially on the weekend.  Mind you, the last time I went it was a Friday night and we waited only 10 minutes.  But even if you do have to wait, you can always hop over to Barnes and Noble or Best Buy and shop until your hour is up.   Oh, and I can't forget mentioning the cheesecakes.  Delish!!  The Godiva one is too rich for me, but all the others are wonderful, that is if you're a cheesecake person.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1080

Since my first visit i've been back there many times and even had a birthday dinner there. The food is good and you get a big amount. But after going there so many times i've run outta food to order. There were a few dishes where i wished i never ordered, some of them were just black and look like crap, but some were delicious. The cheesecake is definitely the best. They have the creamiest cheesecake i've ever tasted and they have a big variety of cheesecake.

The wait was about 15-20 mins. The waiting area does not have enough places to sit so almost everyone just stood around awkardly looking at each other. The bar area looks nice and its always full. I had the filet mignon but it comes with fries and onion rings. To substitute with asparagus and mash potatoes they would charge extra? That's ridicolous. I asked for medium rare and it was cooked perfect. The meat just melts in your mouth and did not require any seasoning. It was a good piece of steak. My fiancee had the the angel hair shrimp pasta and she said it's very good. She loves shrimp pasta. The portions are very generous. The price was about average. I thought maybe a little overpriced. The customer service was excellent. Our waitress paid close attention to us even though it was very busy. She was very pleasing. Great time I would go back again for sure.

I ordered Fish Tacos and extra salsa. I think they were out of fish and substituted chicken, though out of a can and completely tasteless. Their idea of salsa is a tablespoon of rough-chopped tomatoes. (also out of a can I think). Eventually I learned that Tabasco was available and helped make a tasteless dish less so. Luckily the beer was drinkable and helped wash down this truly tasteless abomination.  Only reason I went there was because of friend's choice.

I recommend the lettuce wraps, Thai spring rolls, chicken quesidilla, and the avocado egg rolls, all of which are $1.95-$4.95 (and you know what their portions look like). Other items on the H.H. menu include multiple salads, pork sliders, and the infamous fried mac n' cheese balls.  Items on the regular menu that I can't resist are the Kobe burger (ordered rare-med rare, how any cut of Kobe beef should be ordered, duh). Also, the Jamaican black pepper shrimp with black beans and fried plantains is delicious as well. I know people complain about the portion size, but why don't you save a dent in your wallet by sharing an app/entree, this works every time for us. I also love coming here for Sunday Brunch items- My all time fave is the Monte Cristo breakfast style!!!!!! The Brioche bread is already pre-soaked in syrup and dusted with powdered sugar- it is pretty much awesome.  Lastly, one out of about every 5 times I come here, I treat myself to a slice of cheesecake (shared of course, they have roughly 1,000 calories to a slice). I haven't tried that many yet but if you go before the end of October and you feel like splurging on calories, the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake is so delectable.

Matthew W.,"Sacramento, United States",89,77,34,4.0,9/11/2006,"I wish I could give The Cheesecake factory four and a half stars.  It deserves more than a four, but not necessarily a five.  The Cheesecake Factory is an excellent restaurant.  There is a very nice atmosphere, created by the dim lighting, which also causes a romantic air.  There is very good service as well.  While you are waiting for your meal, they serve you fresh, warm bread in two types.  Just a hint: if you are going to order a main entree, plan on getting about three meals out of it.  Personally, I go for an appetizer, which is one or two meals.  My favorite is the fried macaroni and cheese.  You are served four breaded and fried balls of macaroni and cheese on a chunky marinara.  When you plunge your fork into the ball, you will find lots of white cheddar cheese and macaroni.  You may find yourself drowning in saliva while eating this ambrosia.  Then, they bring you the bill....  Although it isn't too bad, it's still pricey.  Then, it's time for desert!  They have about 20 different types of cheesecake.  It takes a while to decide.  My favorite is the ""lemon raspberry.""  Be careful about when you come.  During Christmas shopping season, waits can be as long as two hours.  Normally, they're about 45 minutes.  If you get there early or on a weekday, you may be seated immediately.  This place is a must-try.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1080

Sometimes it's over cooked and sometimes it's not even cooked. How can you get pasta wrong?! Then another time, I ordered their house salad and instead I got brown chunks of lettuce on a small plate. Usually the salads are huge (can share with 2 people), but that one time, I got a plate that looked like it was sitting in the fridge pre-made for the last week or so. Gross right?! So gross. Other times I get lazy waiters/waitresses who look like they're fed up with serving. Dude, be happy you're serving me cause I am pretty generous with tips.

Big Appetite K.,"San Jose, United States",29,123,,4.0,31/8/2007,"It took a while for Cheesecake Factory to be established in Sacramento, but it seems like it's been a hit w/ the public so far. Although it seems like there are mixed reviews of this place, I've had some good dinners here. They offer a multitude of options, including (of course) tons of different cheesecakes. I really love the dulce de leche chessecake, but that's usually after a meal. As for the meals... Their Macadamian Crusted Ono is one of my favorites, and their various pasta dishes are nice too. They also have a Soy-glazed Salmon, which is tasty. They also have some nice appetizers as well, if you're in need of starting off the meal with something to get you going. This place definitely doesn't cut you short on options or variety, but one thing that I really don't like are the long waits. I happened to have dined here when it seems busy, but it might be that it'll be busy here for a while, since it's still one of the newer options in the area. The service was nice, and my servers seemed attentive every time I've dined here... As for parking, the restaurant is located in a busy plaza, so sometimes it'll take you a while to find a decent spot... But, you will more than likely end up having to walk a bit from your car to the restaurant... As for bringing kids or family, it's not a bad option.

Christopher O.,"Seattle, United States",124,65,,3.0,18/5/2007,"I want to give it four because I've not had a bad experience there, but at the same time, it is noisy there, and though the food is consistently good, it could be better. However, don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten there. This is my thing with the cheesecake factory: It's obviously a chain, a big chain that tries to please everybody. I usually hate that kind of place, because it almost invariably fails. Cheesecake Factory probably still doesn't please everybody, but for a restaurant that has so many pages in their menu that it looks more like a collection of the menus of every restaurant in town, I have to say that I was impressed by how good the food was. Not just ""hey, not bad"", but it actually seemed like somebody was paying attention enough to make sure that it wasn't just okay, but that every dish was thoughtfully prepared. This is not to say that my mind was blown. But just about everything I've ever had there has been good and a step above what I expected. The price also seems somewhat justified. True, for every plate of lasagna at the Cheesecake Factory, there is probably an Italian restaurant in town that costs about the same and tastes better. If you MUST have fantastic pasta, go to that place. But if you're going to have it at the Cheesecake Factory, I don't think the food will be offensive to your taste, and maybe a little gregarious to, but not offensive to your wallet, either. It is often crowded and noisy. Their cheesecake? Yeah, it's okay. Pretty good, even. However, I would expect better from a restaurant that has ""Cheesecake "" in the title, but the moniker versus food quality hardly earns the chain of being labelled as a total charlatan (if you can call a restaurant chain a charlatan). This is a place to go when you're with a big group of people who can't all agree on what they want, basically, because nobody will be grossed out. You'd have to be a huge food snob to find it gross. I went here on a date once, and we had some really good food and wine and had a nice time.

Seated outside at a nice table with a big umbrella (it was hella hot, so the umbrella was super) and promptly attended to. I love their Strawberry Lemonade.

Their cheesecake list is absolutely amazing.  I've made it a life goal to try every cheesecake on that list.   The food is wonderful and the service is fantastic.  You definitely get what you pay for.  The only bad thing is going on a Saturday night when the place is packed.   And don't forget to try the cheesecake.  That's the one thing you have to try no matter what.  I mean, it's not called the cheesecake factory for nothing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=980
Karen B.,"Sacramento, United States",62,87,45,3.0,29/1/2007,"(That's really a 3 1/2.  We need to lobby Yelp to let us halve those stars!) I used to love this place.  Now I, [sigh] pity the fool (yeah, I know) who still feels that way.  I used to visit the San Francisco CF like it was an event.  I sat as long as three hours waiting to eat there.  I would then gorge myself on bread, a huge portion of whatever entree I ordered, and topped it off with one of their decadent slices of cheesecake.  Since then I have eaten at four different locations: downtown SF, Oakridge Mall in San Jose, Valley Fair Mall in Santa Clara, and our location here at Arden Fair.  By the time I moved to Sacramento (one year ago) I was almost sick of the place.  Why so bitter?  Well, like I said, the place is so nice inside it feels like an event.  Thus, many people choose this place to hold birthday gatherings.  Here's why that's a terrible idea:    1. Prices.  If you're the one member of the party who's strapped for cash and want to walk away spending about $15, you're screwed.  The entrees range from $10-30, the average, I'd say being $13-14.  If you want anything with protein, be prepared to shell out at least $15. 2. Portions. The prices match up with the portions, but who on earth eats this much?  If you order my personal favorite Luau Salad, the leftovers are not going to last a night in the fridge. 3. Wait time.  They don't take reservations.  Did I mention I waited three hours to eat there once?  The wait is always insane during dinnertime.  Unless you show up at 11 am you'll be waiting for a while. The warm and fuzzy in me feels compelled to note that they make some of the best salads I have ever had.  If I want a salad for a meal (which is rare) the first place I think of is Cheesecake, hands down.  My personal favorite is the Luau Salad.  I am also rather fond of the Chicken Tostada Salad (though a little heavy on the cilantro.)     This place makes some damn good cheesecake.  I fail-proof order is the fresh strawberry - it's a classic.  Dulce de Leche, though I feared might be too sweet, was divine - rich without being overpowering.  However, I almost feel that they got a little zealous with their combinations.  Some of those cheesecakes really never had to be made.  German chocolate cheesecake?  Boston cream cheesecake?  These flavors are much better by themselves; I ended up six dollars poorer to find out. In summation, Ups: cheesecake, decor, monster salads, Bang-Bang chicken 'n shrimp Downs: waiting, fatty (FATTY!) food, ridiculously large portions, and cancer-causing Styrofoam to-go boxes. Wow, that was rough.  Hey, if you've never been there, you gotta check it out.  It's still pretty good, I'm just kind of sick of it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=980

Take Out: Depending, sometimes it takes a while to get the food if you pick up from the bakery. It's not that bad. To-Go from the car was quicker than picking up inside at one point. :) The people who pick up the phone are usually friendly and quick on getting what kind of order you want.  Inside: Not a long wait at all, at least not what I'm used to -- having to wait 20, 30 minutes in Seattle. Sheesh!

I'm usually not all that experimental but Cheesecake Factory has gotten me out of my old habits! They also have a fabulous dirty martini complete with a gigantic olive stuffed with bleu cheese. The glass is as big as my head (and that's pretty big), and nothing gets you drunk like a $10 martini (either that or you convince yourself that you are drunk because you just spent $10 on a drink). Even though it takes anywhere from half an hour to two hours to get a table, it's well worth the wait. Outside seating is heated and ok- if you enjoy a view of all the cars driving down Arden Way.

Anyway, it has a different feeling to it than the one located a top Macy's in San Francisco. I noticed they had a sportsbar type area off to the side where you can watch some sports games if you wanted to. Had to wait for almost an hour for seating in which they gave us a ""pager thing"" that would blink red when there's a table available. The food was a bit pricey although that comes with eating at a place like this. It wasn't that great though. I've had better hamburgers at In-N-Out. The cheesecake is what I really like though.

Nesto J.,"Stockton, United States",125,91,79,4.0,2/9/2008,"Yes, its a chain but I really like it here. It is near the mall and gets crowded/busy in the evening. The menu is gi-normous and I've had quite a few things (me and friends always eat off eachother's plates) and enjoyed all of it. Portions are huge as well, an appetizer would fill up most people. Plus, I always have leftovers which are great the next day and give me an excuse to use the microwave for once.  Things I like are the thai lettuce wraps (with 3 lovely sauces but always so messy) and the jambalaya pasta, not crazy bout the rice but love the pasta and I suggest asking for more sauce, they get stingy now and then. Service is usually good, its a bit loud inside, huge and open but crowded, don't be suprised if the neighboring waiter's behind is in ur face (not a good thing). Its also dark and very, very cold. I can't imagine what their electricity bill is like to make that cavern freeze like that. I'm a cold weather person but I don't like a 30 degree drop compared to outside, however, I'm sure the waiters appreciate it.  Lastly, I'm not a fan of cheesecake oddly enough, I've had some, they're okay, but i'm not the best person to be commenting on that. So anyway, a good, solid place to eat!

David L.,"Sacramento, United States",24,17,1,1.0,23/3/2007,"Seriously, the only Factory I found actually hold up the standards, was the one in Beverly Hills (LA Location). I really don't like this place, the food is pretty much crappy and as for the cheese cake, I would rather go to Chicago for that. Yes! They have the best kind in the US, its next to this Modern Art Museum (President Clinton would fly out there just to get there cheesecake!) Basically it all seems really cheap, the seats and the interior - yet the exterior is unique is different from anything else in the general area. It almost fools you into thinking it might actually be a good place to go for a meal. Thank goodness I called there bluff, icky. Okay. Story time :) I have two younger brothers, and lets just say they like to start trouble and they had one these hoodlum friends with us. Now to make this story interesting, one of my brothers had my dads visa because he was in Dallas  - Okay, so! We open up getting about 4 or 5 starters, plus 4 bottles of Sparkling Water and some soda as well. We get another 6 Main course plates, three of which were the steak (here is where things start going downhill). When my youngest brother asked for the steak the waitress asked him how he would like it cooked. He replies ""Rare.... RAW!"" - Because of his age, 12 years old she makes sure that he know what he is asking for and he replies ""...BLOODY!"" I couldn't help from laughing, there was more to what  he said but I can't remember his exact words. So bad turns to worse, we force him to eat that.... we also had a pasta dish which got covered in salt, mind you they did that. They just forgot they had and it ruined one of there half eaten plates. As this is going on they are spitting up soda all over themselves from all the laughter. And more experiments took place upon my younger brother, a suicide drink. Noooooow, we didn't have access to any fountain drink thing so they improvised and made a really bad mix of something nasty. So he gets peer pressured into drinking it, GAGS and this mix goes splashing all over the wall and table. Let me tell you we made quite a scene. Another funny moment was when they spit wads at drunk people sitting across from us (let me tell  you, I had no part in this) Other think when flying into other booths on either side of us. I don't think people were very happy with my younger brothers.... I laughing the entire time, seriously - it was chaos! Furthermore, they bent the forks and spoons - now they didn't mean to the first time, they were just cheap (who would have thought...) Soda cups tip over ruining more food. Some how I was unharmed and escaped without a hitch. I am sure more happened, but I don't like that food! BLAH for BLAND!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=980

Kendyce M.,"North Sacramento, Sacramento, United States",213,156,20,3.0,31/8/2007,"Cheesecake Factory food is rich, creamy, spiced, thick, oily, hot, noodley, sweet, crunchy, flaky.  I have no idea what I like best. I've had pizza there I think, some pasta dishes, something with pesto, fried stuff, seafood. We had some leftovers, and when we went to reheat the stuff the next day for lunch, it was congealed and resting in a puddle of grease. This is one of those typical Cali places where you could get all dressed up fancy for an early dinner (cause it's an expensive place) and get seated next to people wearing grubby T-shirts and cutoffs (cause they came in for appetizers after garage sale-ing all day). Not that there's anything wrong with that.   Is it true that a person must be 19 to dine here? Or a rumor?

We have ordered take out from The Cheesecake Factory a few times now because it just so happens that we end up ordering on the weekends and don't feel like braving the weekend dinner crowds.   The website is relatively helpful when it comes to making dinner decisions (you can even see pictures of some items online), the only downside is that they don't list their prices.  The staff is helpful when taking your order over the phone and bringing the food out to your car. As for the food itself, it has always been mediocre at best.  What I mean by this is that the taste and quality just doesn't seem to match up to the price.  I remember eating a burger and a spicy prawn dish with rice - soggy fries and not enough prawns. The upside is that the portions are a decent size and I usually have leftovers. Overall, I would say that eating food from The Cheesecake Factory is a little overrated and definitely overpriced.  The only upside to ordering  takeout is the convenience factor of them bringing the food directly to your car.  I hope that table service is much, much better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1000

Plus the dinner was actually decent.  My husband got the grilled flatiron steak and I had the Steak Diane.  Both were cooked perfectly and tasted pretty good.  Portions were generous too.  Now..the bad parts...I felt like everything I was eating off of was dirty.  2 of my 4 utensils actually had food crusted on them which just made me shudder. My other 2 utensils were so spotted from the dishwasher it looked like they were dirty as well.  When my dinner came, the plate had stuff crusted under the rim.  I figured maybe it happened when my food was being plated?? Anyhow, it was just so gross...and I didn't feel like I could ask for any more replacements as I had already had my silverware replaced.  Plus the table looked like it had food residue on it from prior customers, but in the low light and being that everything else with the exception of my wine glass had been dirty...I could have imagined the dirty table part.  Lastly, the cheesecake was very mediocre.  We ordered the classic cherry cheesecake to share.  It came with a MOUNTAIN of whipped cream on top it and another MOUNTAIN on the plate. Really??? Do we need 2 cups of whipped cream with the cheesecake? So overdone it just ruined it.  Plus the crust was super wimpy..barely could tell there was a crust it was so thin.  I like a cheesecake with a graham cracker crust that you actually have to cut through with your fork.  This crust was more akin to a crumb topping at the bottom of the cake pan.  The cake filling of sour cream was ok, not great.  The cherry topping could have come straight out of a can..certainly didn't have the authentic feel of a place that's been making cheesecake for like 50 years.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1000

Vernon N.,"Lincoln, United States",0,14,,4.0,7/5/2008,"I haven't been disappointed yet.  This is a very popular and busy place, so I expect the service to be a little distracted.  That said, the food has been pretty good.  The menu is a collection of fun dishes.  I have my favorite - Chicken Madera.  The portions are large and most items are pretty good.  I haven't found anything that I thought was bad.  I like the looks of the place  - it's not a serious dinner restaurant - it's a fun place for gathering with friends and having drinks before hitting a movie.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1100
Leung Y.,"Toronto, Canada",7,38,301,4.0,24/12/2017,"After the 1 star review for the Toronto store, we decided to go Cheesecake Factory in the States :) We went there are lunch time on Dec 23 to the location right next to the busiest mall, and we were able to find parking nearby without paying for the valet service (which is at a extremely reasonable price for crazy holiday times at the mall!).  We went in and got seating right the way, at a great location inside. The waiter service was prompted.  He gave us water, automatically ask if we want lemon with it.  I asked for the brown bread only. I took a picture of the menu, and decide to go for my chubbilicious Chicken Marsala.  My chubby boyfriend got his burger and fries. The food took a while to arrive, and so I used the time for the bathroom.  Good god I love the USA bathroom.  Gigantic stalls and clean!  The water is a bit on the powerful side though.  They are smart enough to put a trash can next to the door, so you don't have to touch the door with you bare hands.  That is thoughtful. Food eventually arrives (after we ate 2/3 loaves of bread from the first basket).  The taste is as good as I remember.  Chicken is soft (4 slices).  Burger meat well cooked and still juicy.  Chicken Marsala pasta is a bit on the greasy side but I knew what I am getting when I ordered. I originally wanted to get the strawberry cheesecake, but got no more room after the large pasta order.  My boyfriend got his usually key lime cheesecake (which I stole a couple bite).  If you don't like whip cream, ask for no whip.  Some lactose intolerance guy argue saying they don't come with whip... and I was right!  Every order come with whip, unless you tell them you don't need it. We got our water refill without asking (but very close to ask). We were seated next to a big party with at least 5 kids and it was quite (despite all the sugar they were having!). I looked and the kids come with plastic cups with straws.  Very thoughtful. Gave it 4 stars only because I the arrival of the food was slow. I will return!  Just have to burn those carloies first before I could return.  The skinny menu options ain't bad, but I am going to the dark side :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento
Gisele X.,"Sacramento, United States",47,223,486,4.0,18/12/2017,"I had a good dining experience tonight at Cheesecake Factory. The two of us were sat quickly, within 5-10 minutes. There were larger parties waiting. Our server, a woman in her 40s-50s, with shoulder-length hair, was our server. She provided stellar service. That was the highlight for me. The pepperoni pizza was ok. The white chocolate caramel macadamia cheesecake was ok. I'm no fan of the airy flavorless puffs they put on the plate. (Sorry for whining.) It's difficult for me to write a review on a large chain restaurant. I'm rarely a fan of chain restaurants. They usually underwow me with the quality of their food offerings. I'm especially not a fan of chains with a lot of blind followers. (It doesn't deserve a wait of more than 10-15 minutes, but doesn't every location always have an outrageous wait time?) I've been to Cheesecake a dozen times or so in the past 20 years. I'll go (once in a while) if that's what someone really wants, but meh, I could live without. Four stars because the service was great and the food was ok.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento
Ray H.,"Carmichael, United States",4,73,58,1.0,16/12/2017,"In the last month we've been here three times. First time Oscar was our server. He was very good. If we asked if they could make something a little different he would go and check. He was  very accommodating and deserves 5 stars.    Then we had somebody she never told us her name but the first thing she did when she came over was to ask if we wanted bread?  That seemed unusual because we've been coming here over 20 years and I servers just bring you the bread to the table. It maybe she's stupid because when we asked her what the difference was between two dishes she said the sauce was just different. The statement the sauce is just different is so ambiguous what is that supposed to tell the customer? It turned out one dish was covered with cold chopped tomatoes vs a tasty lemon-garlic sauce (a male perhaps the kitchen manager knew exactly what we wanted THANKFULLY)   Tonight we've been sitting at a table for an hour, when I finally got my strawberry smoothie (i will say is very very good). I ordered an appetizer which came out the same time as my entree. Seriously am I suppose to eat both of the same time?  So they said they would bring the entree out later. Little did I realize it would be the same entree burnt marks and all.    Lucky for us our waitress was taking a break from the gentleman who replaced her seems to have his active gather whoever it is thank you.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento

I had 3 drafts on tap, 3 humongous plates of food, and complimentary bread!  The ambiance was smooth yet lively. And the best part about it was that I was treated like a King.

The bar area is cool because it's large with tvs so you can eat appetizers and watch the football games!  Parking is okay, can get very busy but there is plenty of parking because it's connected with the mall. They also have valet parking as well. Food is average, nothing spectacular! They have a wide variety of choices which is good when you bring a large group but I feel the food is only mediocre.  I've had their burgers, to pastas to the steak. Just recently I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and it was very dry... the chicken was not moist but the chipotle mayo was good. I also tried the BBQ burger and again, it was dry.... overcooked. The fries are crispy and good but the burgers are only so so. My lady had the fish tacos and they were good, not great. You can have your fish tacos either fried or grilled and we had it grilled which was a good decision....  We tried 3 different apps... the deep fried mac and cheese balls, stuffed mushrooms and fried zucchini! The mushrooms were small and you only get 6... flavor blend.... the zucchini was small and lacked flavor. The fried mac and cheese balls were really good... good batter and flavor... my favorite of the night. Cheesecake is their signature dish.... i tried the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and it was good and light but too much whip cream!  Overall, it's a fun place for get togethers but food is only mediocre.... not bad but not stunning!  Lastly, they do not take reservations and you have to be prepared to wait at least 35-40 minutes!

Rosa P.,"Sacramento, United States",23,102,61,2.0,13/9/2017,"What happened?!  What happened to the ONE chain restaurant I could always count on in Sacramento. Ugh, what a disaster.  If Monday wasn't already shitty enough, Cheesecake made sure to put the final nail in the coffin.  Got to CF with friends around 7/710p. We waited abt 10 min to be greeted by our waitress and waited abt another 10 for water. I asked for straws as I hate drinking straight from the cup. ( I know, I'm a psycho). After the third time, I eventually ended up asking another waitress for the damn straws.  We were finally able to order and also asked her for more bread while we waited. After asking twice, she brings more bread and ends up spilling my water all over the table, my sweet potato fries and my lap. Sigh.... at this point, I thought: maybe she's busy and stressed? Idk, I try to give ppl the benefit of the doubt.  That changed when my meal came. We didn't get our dinner until after 8p and my meal was just a plate of orange chicken. Lol no rice. My friend ordered the Carne Asada steak medallions and it was three pieces of meat while the rest of the plate was covered in rice and whatever else they threw on there to make it look full.  Once our food arrived, our waitress disappeared. Never saw her again. Up until it was time for her to get the tab paid.  We eventually asked for the manager as the entire night was just one failing disaster after another. He was attentive and ended up giving us 25% off our tab. He left aaaaannnndddd our waitress never came back! After waiting for her for about 15 min, we ended up walking up the hostess to find us someone to help close us out.  I was craving CF soooo bad and this experience just sucked balls. I was disappointed in the way we were waited on. She was hardly attentive and seemed like everything we asked for was a nuisance. (But it was all basic shit we should have gotten) I usually always sit in the bar area and am always treated so awesome by the staff there.  I really wanted a piece of cheesecake, but by the end of the night I just wanted to get out of there. Dammit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento

However, after waiting exactly 25 minutes, we were seated.  Food is not that great. Super oily/greasy and HUGE portions (it's what they're known for). I got a pasta dish and was able to eat 1/3. I took the other to go. My boyfriend on the other hand was super hungry and ate it all. One thing I do love about the cheesecake factory, is the brown bread!! I usually ask for seconds.

My food is usually fantastic and brought out in a decent amount of time. Giving them 3 stars because of all of the other pleasant experiences there, prior to this one. Here's what happened, yes, all in one night: never got a soup spoon with my bowl of soup, (it's a giant bowl), we asked for straws three times with two different people, our server spilled water all over our table and my friend by accidentally dropping the butter dish for the bread, they replaced the fries that the water spilled on, but not her utensils and napkin. Our server was completely apologetic but I felt like we had to ask for everything! This is only for the service.... Now for the kitchen: it took about 45 mins for our food to come out. We waited so long that the booth behind us had 2 different parties that had come and gone. Also, My friend that got spilled on ordered orange chicken with extra vegetables and white rice. Our server wrote it down right but the kitchen plated it without rice. My other friend ordered carne asada medallions with rice... her poor plate had 3 chunks of meat on it... it looked like the saddest plate in the world! If you're hungry, don't order that!

It came with cooked carrots and mash potatoes. Carrots were not cooked all the way so it was still hard. Mash potatoes were definitely like a 2/5. But hey, at least they nailed the protein which really matters. I have tried their pastas and burgers dishes but they were nothing to rave about.

Julie P.,"Northern California, United States",6,148,460,3.0,29/5/2017,"What the heck happened to the Cheesecake Factory? We sat at one of the tables in the bar area  for faster service. There were 2 of us and we sat at table with 4 seats. There were already 4 small appetizer plates and 4 silverware sets.  We ordered the French onion soup and Thai lettuce wraps. The lettuce wraps were good , no complaints. It came with noodles, carrots, cucumbers and bean sprouts. And chicken satay of course. There was peanut sauce and a ginger sauce. The 3rd sauce was good but I'm not sure what it was made out of. There were large pieces of lettuce to wrap all the goodies in.  The French onion soup was lame. There was not enough cheese in it. Not sure if this was the ""low cal"" version or what.   Service was ok. I do like to be left alone when I'm at a restaurant.  The biggest disappointment has to be those 4 plates on the table. Each and every one of those small appetizer plates had food particles stuck to them and looked visibly dirty.. Greasy finger marks or something !! I opened all the silverware and there was food stuck to those as well! Disgusting. This is why I prefer to eat at home.   Maybe it's time for a new dishwasher! Gross.  The best part about our visit today was the carrot cake :) Maybe the crummy-ness of the experience has to do with the shit hole area it's in. The Arden area by the mall is nasty.

I'm also really upset about the fact they charge for their Special ranch sauce that I used to have with their brown (wheat) bread.

It was family tradition to dine here for my birthday celebration every year (since I was 18, I'm 22 now), but I'm sad to say it's time for a change. The wait was exactly 30 mins so not mad about that, but it all started going downhill when the lady seated us at our table pulling a chair out into the middle of the walkway when I preferred sitting on the booth side so I had to push the chair back in and make my way to the booth.. not a big deal just annoying. Then our server came by and we ordered drinks and you guessed it, he totally forgot mine. I just knew he should've taken notes before he even left the table. I still gave the server the benefit of the doubt and assumed he was new and poorly trained.  20 mins after waiting for the server to take down our order, we waited a whole 45 mins before food got to us.. and it wasn't even our food. This lady came to our table with fried macaroni like no, not us but seriously where's our food. Quit playing. One guy literally had 1 table and kept passing them multiple times.. seriously a waste of productivity. It was so unorganized like did all the managers and experienced workers go on vacation or.  Another 15 mins later, entres come out.. before appetizers. Now I'm not even mad anymore, just confused. So let's talk about the entre, farfalle specifically terrible there was a piece of string cheese in it, looked more like a lunch potion than a dinner one trust me I would know since that is the only thing I get from this place. Got charged for the farfalle with chicken when I got it without the chicken, makes no sense. Okay appetizers, don't recommend any of them: tater tots, fried zucchini, nachos all a big thumbs down. I mean factory nachos were a go-to until they burned it.. like how does that happen? The chips were brown, anyone could see that even under the dim light. Yet the server, Theodore who insisted we call him Teddy, (firstly you aren't sweet nor cute like a Teddy so no one is going to call you that) even questioned me like wth, dumb (bleep) you eat it then mf.

Elisha W.,"Sacramento, United States",0,7,4,4.0,5/12/2017,"I'd been wanting to visit the Cheesecake Factory for a while, but never got around to it until today. Usually, there is a line outside when I drive by on weekends, but it was a weekday, so not too busy. There was a 10 minute wait, but that wasn't bad, considering I've waited way too long at other restaurants that weren't worth the wait. Our servers were friendly and I got a birthday song. Also got a complimentary sundae with a candle! The food was delicious and left us all stuffed. Which saddened me because if you're visiting here, you want to taste the cheesecake. I couldn't eat any there, but bought two pieces to enjoy at home. I've only had a forkful of the key lime cheesecake and I can see why this place is so popular. Was a bit pricy, but less than $100 for 3 people and extra cheesecake is pretty nice.  Only thing that was bad was a friend of mine ordered a burger well done, but she got it rare. It wasn't a problem to send it back, though. Would definitely come again!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=40
Sanz E.,"Pinole, United States",270,104,121,3.0,6/3/2017,"Chain restaurants don't usually have a high bar to begin with. But this particular location at this particular time was even below that bar.  First, they were out of bread. Then when I went to order an appetizer, the server told me to pause because had to check if they had it. So I asked him, keep it simple, let me know what you don't have so I can know what not to order. He comes back out and the list is pretty long (17 items). Someone somewhere messed up and didn't order  correctly to keep their inventory full. The server told us they were out of most of the items by noon.  Both steak Diane's came with so many mushrooms, we had to brush them off to find the steak. At least it was cooked as requested (medium). The fries our table ordered were salty.  They would have gotten 2 stars if it wasn't for our server who tried his best to make up for the restaurants shortcomings.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=40

I got the crab ragoons and something else that I forgot. Both were worth the price.  For my main course, I got the bacon burger. It was sooo good! They include huge pieces of bacon on it.

From the start it  was like she was hoping for a challenge, willing to go the extra mile. like she just wanted us to be happy.  I had the crispy chicken costoletta. It melted in my mouth like cotton candy. These three lightly breaded chicken delights were on point! I usually don't get the chicken dish. Normally a dry affair, this was nothing like that. Even the red mashed potatoes were killer. Growing up we had mashed potatoes often. It kinda burned me out on it. So when I come across some that I want more of, it's really saying something.  If you haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory your missing out! When you walk in its obviously a little upper scale. Big screen monitors showing menu items while you wait for a table.

She came back about 10 minutes later with all of our drinks but the lighting seem to have gotten darker and it infuriated us. So we asked her if we could turn up the lighting and she asked management and she came back and it turns out that the lights were on a timer? So my party had to use it's flashlights on our phones to see the menu and even when the food came but the food was good especially the cheesecake for dessert but we were very upset that we could not have the lighting turned up :( we sat there for about 15 minutes with empty water glasses and when we asked for more water the waitress came back and it seemed like the water was from tap and not cold at all.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=40

Henry L.,"San Mateo, United States",2337,833,2811,4.0,28/1/2017,"Nice The place is located right outside of the mall. You actually have to walk outside for quite a while to get to it, because it's near the outside boundary of the parking lot. Outside, the structure looks huge, like some kind of church. Inside, the decoration is also fancy, with paintings on the wall, dim lighting, and lots and lots of customers waiting for tables. You get a vibrating device that notifies you when your table is ready. There is a huge cheesecake counter right next to the waiting area so you will be more than hungry before you sit down looking at all the cheesecake! The service are all quick and friendly. The food took a while to come out, but that's only because they have so many customers. The food was amazing! I got the Factory sandwich, which was actually toasted hard on the outside. There was lots of beef and ingredients. The angel hair pasta was also cooked pretty nicely, served warm and and lots of flavor. The Cosmo cocktail was fruity and sweet.

Nicole B.,"Elk Grove, United States",269,211,644,4.0,10/7/2017,"My two cents on Cheesecake  Atmosphere-  Usually located in most midsize and large cities.Besides Sac I have been to Walnut Creek, LA, Atlanta, with San Francisco being my favorite.  Spacious, good size bar,  plenty of seating. Casual while being slightly elegant.  Great place for a casual date, family, outing or special occasion.   Service- Like most chains hit or miss. Some occasions service is stellar. Can get prompt, friendly, efficient service. Other times you can get a subpar server, and service can be slow.  Food-  The highlight of Cheesecake factory is the wide variety of their menu. From the burgers, salads, appetizers, to full size entrees they have something for everyone. Servings are generous and the food is always tasty. Wide variety of cocktails that are delicious with many creative non alcohol drinks as well.  And of course their Cheesecake....So many choices,  creamy and with a good size crust..My favorites are the white chocolate raspberry and the banana caramel.  Salivating just writing this review!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=20

Robert S.,"Vallejo, United States",96,1,1,1.0,24/6/2017,"Let me begin this review by saying I've never been inclined to post a review before. The fact that I've been driven to it in itself should say a lot about my experience here. We were seated quickly and our server came and asked us what we would like to order, we ordered and that was the last time we would see him for the next 45 mins. Once the food arrived (sent by someone else) one of our orders was wrong ( we asked for cheese on our sliders they came to the table without). We informed the person who brought our food of the mistake and it was taken back to the kitchen to be corrected.  When the sliders came back the cheese had been torn (by hand) and tiny broken pieces were added to each slider. The manager ""apologized"" rushing us asking again and again as we tried to address the issue ""well do you want the sliders taken of the bill?"" The original server (who mysteriously returned to serve the table next to us again and again throughout this ordeal) instead of apologizing issued excuses for both his absence (I was busy with other tables) and the poor quality of the food (it was the kitchen)  As I began with I don't ever review on yelp I'm a pretty even keel person and know that bad service can be the result of a bad day and I would hate to do something to potentially hurt a business or endanger a job but service from our server to management was lacking. I will be sending this review to corporate as well hopefully they can do better for other customers but I will not be back personally.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=20
Terri N.,"Concord, United States",533,725,2908,4.0,28/6/2017,"Consistently good experiences here!   Once you get past the overwhelming nature of the Cheesecake Factory experience and are a seasoned pro, no longer startled by their menu so large it contains advertising space, their reliability and predictability can make them a very safe and satisfying option. Whether that's a good or bad thing is entirely up to you! As for me, I dig it!  I have two very safe go-to meals at the Factory - their fantastic Thai For White People dish called Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp (coconut peanut heaven, and easily 3 meals on one plate), and their killer Club Sandwich, probably the best club sandwich I've ever had. Generous of course, with nice fresh ingredients, but what makes it for me is some sweetness in the sandwich bread - it elevates the sandwich into the heavens and makes it so much more than savory. And everything at the Factory makes wonderful leftovers - which they must anticipate, with their insane portion sizes.  Don't forget about the cheesecake!  And disregard so many other reviewers throwing caloric shade on dessert - don't kid yourself about where you're eating dinner. And friendly reminder, they are more than happy to box up a slice of cheesecake for you, which for me always last a couple days! Everything in moderation, including moderation. And if you still doubt, don't forget you can order a bowl of fresh strawberries for dessert too, you silly people you. But you could also score a slice of their amazing lemon meringue cheesecake, or the glorious red velvet, or the orgasm that is the Limoncello cream torte. Go big - the Factory wants you to.  Always keep in mind that this place is a gold mine, and they don't take reservations! A wait is damn near guaranteed. Don't get mad at them for being popular, and attached to a mall! I will definitely be back. A visit to Cheesecake Factory is like a visit to a reliable old friend - you know what to expect, and you know you'll walk away smiling.

The dirty dining floor and restrooms needed cleaning. Our waiter also forgot one of our entrees. It was actually a hidden blessing that he forgot because the portions we got for everything else were huge. First, we were given 3 servings of bread for 2 people. The sweet multi-grain bread tasted amazing with the slightly-salty butter. Neither of us liked the rye bread, but it's not like either of us were compelled to finish it. Second, my gf got full off the appetizer dish by itself. I ordered the Flying Gorilla, a chocolate alcoholic mixer. It was like a really good spiked chocolate milkshake, and I highly recommend it. The fried calamari appetizer was crispy and overall quite tasty. The tomato basil pasta with chicken was average, but enjoyable. All of this was comfort food.

Kevin K.,"Berkeley, United States",527,188,514,2.0,23/12/2016,"The Mediocre Factory . . . It's easy to be taken in by the ""classy"" ambiance of the Cheesecake Factory, but it really is all just smoke and mirrors.  The food isn't that great at all, and HORRIBLY overpriced.   I know I like to whine about overpriced food on yelp from time to time, but Cheesecake Factory really prices their food too high.  I don't think a bacon cheeseburger is worth $15.  Pasta da vinci, albeit decent, isn't worth $18 either.  It's just pene pasta with chicken in wine sauce.  I could make that at home for $4.     Obviously the food does indeed taste decent, but it's definitely a splurge every time I come here.  I don't quite get the huge hype surrounding the CF.   When my friends and I were served our food the other night, we all started eating and almost immediately, my friend found a hair in her pasta and it took a while for us to wave down our waitress, Jess to send the dish back.  Hair is always a disgusting find in a dish.  Needless to say, it seemed that our experience at the CF was turning into a CF. It wasn't Jess' fault.  It was a very busy night at Cheesecake.  It was just sad because my friend had a delay in her eating.  Jess apologized profusely and was very polite about getting my friend a new dish.  The manager even came right up and apologized and comped her entree from the bill.   It was a really nice display of customer service. Jess took wonderful care of us during the whole time though.  Even though I'm not super big on the food at CF, I know good customer service when I see it, and Jess definitely had it.   I ordered a burger and my friends all ordered pasta dishes, with which we were fairly pleased.  I don't like getting little cups of ketchup delivered to me with my burger.  Just give me the bottle please so I can properly drown my burger and fries in ketchup!  It's nice to look classy, but not with ketchup.  It's not amazing food, but it was alright and I had a really nice time with my friends on their last night in town. I definitely wouldn't class my food as anything above mediocre, but it was made up for by the exceptional customer service we experience there from Jess and the manager who was so accommodating.   None of this changes the fact that I just don't really like the food (or the prices, omg) at Cheesecake factory.  It's a lovely looking place with nice and helpful staff, but that's about it.

I always take my left overs home and they're always still pretty good the day after.  My last visit there, for our appetizers we ordered the crab bites and stuffed mushrooms. Now these portions were really small. Came with about 6 pieces each. They were literally bite sized pieces.  For our main dishes we ordered the everything pizza, and the jambalaya pasta. I wasn't too big on the pizza, nothing about it really stood out to me. The jambalaya said it was going to be in a very spicy sauce, but I felt it was mild. The shrimp and chicken pieces were very tender and juicy. As for the sauce of the pasta, it was just ok to me. Again, nothing stood out.  For dessert we ordered the salted caramel cheesecake.

She rolled her eyes and again walked away without saying anything...at this point I feel like we bother her. Brought our wine about 15 mins later with 2 glasses and knowing we have 3 people dining.

Their food is delicious, affordable for the type of restaurant, and there is such a wide range of food options to choose from! In my opinion this is the perfect place for a romantic date night or a celebratory birthday dinner with friends and family!  I mean, you always start off on a good note here when the waiter brings you the delicious soft warm bread that you cannot help but indulge in. To be honest, I go through about 3 of those baskets before my meal even gets to me.  In regards to dishes, you really can't go wrong with any order here but just in case you'd like recommendations, my favorites include: the factory burrito grande and the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. I recently had the egg roll sampler appetizer for the first time and that was delicious too! Ps if you get the factory burrito grande prepare to come VERY HUNGRY! Or you can also take it home and eat it for the next 2 meals. A lot of the dishes are pretty big and I almost always take home leftovers Now comes dessert, because that's obviously the main reason everyone comes here!!! Bring on the cheesecake!!! My favorites are the s'mores cheesecake, the salted caramel cheesecake, and the red velvet one! But truthfully, you really can't go wrong with any of them.

They must have been at the cashier's for at least 5 minutes without being helped. We also noticed that it wasn't as busy as it normally is since their hallway wait area was not packed and there were empty tables. 10:55 PM Got the TAKE-OUT Cuban sandwich. Way too long of a wait time. 10:56 PM I noticed the fries and sandwich were lukewarm. Didn't even bother to ask for hot food because the wait time was not worth it. 11:10 PM Got home and ate the meal. The sandwich was good because of the great quality meats they had and the fresh bread, but again lukewarm. Not worth the wait. There were about 20 fries in the bag and they were comparable to Burger King's. Not worth the extra dollars for the Cheese Cake Factory name attached. Some of the fries had a frozen fry taste to it as well. I suggest to not get fries or if anything, order them extra crispy to make it palatable. Or maybe even get the side salad instead of fries. In general, I would give them 0 stars and not come back due to the approximate 48 minute wait time for a TAKE OUT order and my meal being under par for having to wait during a time when the restaurant isn't that busy.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=100
Lisa X.,"Sacramento, United States",0,30,,4.0,10/2/2017,"0 STAR FOR THE FOOD! I have ordered their food before and I'm not impressed by it. It's a little too expensive for the bland taste it can be. The bread they serve first while we all wait for our order is so good though! I only take a small bite... Their utensils sometimes have dry foods from before stuck on it and that's quite disgusting to me. Ever since this experience, I've been coming here once every 6 months or once a year, but it's slowly becoming none a year. And I don't order their food anymore. Just the cheesecake cause who doesn't love cheesecake? :) 4 STARS FOR THE CHEESECAKE THOUGH! I rarely come here, but when I do, it's usually with my sisters. I'm mainly here for the variety of cheesecake that they have. It's hard to choose what to eat since they all sound and look delicious. They're really expensive though, so it's a good thing that I rarely come here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=100

We came early before the evening rush to celebrate a birthday. I ordered one of my favs,  Chicken Bellagio. It was perfect and as expected. I normally lick the plate clean,  but today I left a few morsels on my plate only because I two fisted the bread and butter before dinner. Not to mention a glass of passion iced tea to expand the dough in my belly. Appetizers and munching bread will always ruin your dinner. But I never learn... Oh well.

Ginny L.,"South San Francisco, United States",161,6,2,1.0,12/6/2017,"I've always remembered Cheesecake Factory for their good food and good customer service but for my experience, this one had neither.  First off, our waiter was kinda cold if I may say. He asked what drinks he could get for us and looked quite impatient while my boyfriend was looking through the menu since we had just sat down. He ended up just getting a water since he noticed that the waiter looked irritated. He then came back and mumbled ""can I start you guys off with some bread and butter?"" I could barely hear what he said and my boyfriend couldn't hear at all and it's not like it was extra loud in there.  Food wise, my boyfriend got the steak Diane and said it was pretty good. I got what I always get: Louisiana chicken pasta. However, mine didn't have much flavor and it was really oily. At other locations, they always come with the block of Parmesan cheese right when they bring me my plate of pasta but this one didn't. It didn't bother me much until it took me over 5 mins to flag down a waiter/waitress for some cheese (we were sitting in an area where waiters and waitresses were coming and going so 5 mins was kinda pushing it). Food did come fast but our appetizer came like 10 mins after our main courses and what we had ordered was literally grilled cheese with a piece a bacon so idk why it took so long lol.  As for service the rest of the night, we never saw our waiter again. It wasn't even him who brought us our food. No one came by to ask how we were doing. We had to wait over 20 mins just to ask for boxes for our food and for the check. However, the lady who did help us at the end with the boxes and check seemed pretty friendly and was the type of customer service I was used to seeing at a Cheesecake Factory.  We tipped really little (didn't even want to tip tbh) and that's coming from people who always tip, even at little snack and drink places.  Tldr; love Cheesecake Factory, just not this one. Will prob not be coming back",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=100

Our dinner party was about 12 people so we waited about 45 minutes until we were seated. In the meantime, we enjoyed some drinks at the bar. I ordered the passion fruit margarita, it was tasty but really sweet. For $13 a cocktail, I would hope for more alcohol.  After finally being seated, the service was okay. There was long periods of time where our server was not to be found. We asked for bread 3 times and finally received a refill. This was also after our good has arrived. I ordered the steak Diane, it was okay. I ask for a medium rare the temperature on the steak was all different. Since some pieces were thicker than others so some pieces were well done, some pieces of medium rare. We spent $120 between for our 2 person tab for drinks, entrees and cheese cheesecake to take home. Overpriced for mediocre food and service.

Romeo S.,"Sacramento, United States",0,2,1,1.0,6/12/2017,"Let me start off by stating that I love this place and my review is based on an experience we recently had. I must state that I do work in the same complex as these guys so I am more favorable of my opinions towards this place, but not this time. However, We see the same security walk and drive by daily. We park behind the green lines everyday. So if the server who helped us had come into our store, knowing he worked closed by, we would ensure his experience was nothing less than exceptional. This server had a condescending demeanor about him. He did not come by for a while and when we waived him down we had to practically beg for more water. In doing so, he rolled his eyes, walked away and returned with a slam on our table with more water. I am so perplexed to how he is in customer service. No one should be treated as if they were less than a human, especially not in a professional environment. Our horrific experience has tainted our impression on this once great location which has now forced us to do our monthly meetings at another restaurant in the complex. So who was responsible for this horrendous behavior that it has forced me to write such a review? The demonic servers name is Luis M. And if you are punished by receiving him as your server, run and run fast. This review will go on TripAdvisor as well because no one visiting Sacramento needs to have a misconstrued impression of our great people who lives here as Luis is not from Sacramento but hell itself.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=160

It does not really matter whether the main course is good or not when there is such a long wait. The good part is that while I was waiting one of the bus-boys smuggled stuffed cheese olives from the bar. He fed me olives as I was waiting and did not charge me so I guess he stole them. I felt bad about it so I tipped him $5 which also made my lunch significantly more expensive. The stuffed olives were fantastic! I'll come back next time I have more time for lunch, probably during my weekend.

Well now I can brag to them that I finally did!  I decided to come to this place for my first time for my 22nd birthday dinner on a Friday night. 4 of my friends and I came here around 6:30pm (sad we missed the Happy Hour 4-6pm) and it was packed, but luckily we were able to get a booth in like 10-15 minutes.  I asked my friends what was good here and I read the reviews of this place and everyone talks about their cheesecake; specifically their Red Velvet cheesecake so I knew I had to get that for dessert.  Started off with the unlimited bread! I love love their brown bread (had a sweet taste to it) I ended up ordering the Avocado Eggrolls for appetizers and shared it with my friends; we all loved it! For my entree I got the Factory Combination (Steak and Salmon) and it was served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I really enjoyed the steak (marinated in a sauce with mushrooms too) and the mashed potatoes (I'm a big fan of mashed potatoes) and the salmon and asparagus was alright. Steak was the right texture, not too tough and the mashed potatoes were creamy. My friend recommended me to get the Factory Peach Bellini (not a strong drink but a very fruity/girly drink) and I enjoyed it! And of course for dessert, I had a Red Velvet Cheesecake and the staff sang me Happy Birthday as well. Everyone was right, their Red Velvet Cheesecake is the bomb! A few of my friends also bought the Dulce de leche Cheesecake for TOGO and all I can say is that it was also very delicious as well.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=340

Kurt C.,"Sacramento, United States",694,407,2176,4.0,21/6/2014,"I've been lucky enough to have outstanding service here the many different occasions I've gone. Most of the previous visits involved birthdays and I don't remember having ever been neglected the slightest by any of the workers here.  Their servers are conversant, but without being too imposing. The restaurant is huge and they are quite efficient with their use of space from the entrance to the bar, from the dining area to the patio seating -- everything is carefully organized and seemingly spotless. It ultimately makes for a clean and comforting environment.  The food has consistently been satisfactory. I've tried their Fried Calamari appetizer. It's light, and excellent with the garlic dip and the cocktail sauce. The most recent visit I had their Loaded Tater Tots, which you have to be careful with because it comes out really hot; you don't want to burn your tongue and ruin your whole dining experience. Give it a couple minutes and then you can selfishly munch on these tiny flavorful tots. Fresh Grilled Salmon was what I got for my main entree. I was feeling seafood, so why not? It was cooked perfectly, and went well with the mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  Now for the REAL main entree ;) -- the S'mores Cheesecake! It looked as good as I imagined it in my head, and that rarely happens. It tasted even better, so I was extremely pleased, to say the least. Melted marshmallow, crunchy graham crackers, chocolate cheesecake...I can't go on..my mouth's watering too much..Cheesecake Factory sure lives up to their name ~",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=340

I ordered that and my friend got the Louisiana chicken pasta. The spaghetti was really good. Those meatballs are no joke! They were so big and so yummy. The Louisiana chicken pasta is actually one of my usual dishes here. My friend ended up ordering that and I got to have the best of both worlds! Lucky me. That crusted chicken in the pasta has so much flavor. Total yumminess! The pasta can feel pretty heavy though, sometimes. It's pretty greasy. Probably all that butter they use to cook it, but it's good. We also ordered the loaded potato tots. I thought the tots were going to be actual tots with toppings on top like a nacho, but they're actually mashed potato deep fried with bacon and cheese inside, served with sour cream on the side. They were good. I like anything potato and fried. ;) The complimentary bread is so good. They serve the wheat bread warm and butter just melts on top. I always try not to eat so much bread, so I have room for my food, but that never happens. Their dishes are really big too. My friend and I both didn't finish our dishes. And we felt we still had a full dish by the end of our meal. Two people could share a dish if they wanted.  They have really good cheesecakes. I always come here wanting a cheesecake at the end of my meal, but most of the time, I never have room for it! Depending on when you come, there can be quite a wait for a table.

Monique A.,"Pittsburg, United States",935,327,1180,5.0,14/3/2016,"I have always enjoyed coming here for dinner or lunch. They offer lunch portions and a skinny menu. Be prepared most items are very high in calories but I think that's the point when you come. Portions are very large and way too many options. Today I started with the Beets and goat cheese salad. This is always been my favorite. It's light not a heavy dressing and the portion is on the appetizer menu so it's perfect to start off before your main meal. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken over brown rice and it was a huge portion, I recommend that is big enough for two people if you're not that hungry or you want to eat light. The chicken to me wasn't that spicy may be a little bit more on the saltier side because of the sauce. The cashews were really crisp and the brown rice was really good too.  My son ordered the shrimp and sausage pasta, he said he would give it 8 out of 10. I tasted it it's not one of the best pastas for an Italian dish but certainly it's a hearty dish and not too bad.  Lastly we both ordered cheesecake, of course you cannot leave here without ordering one of the 25 + types of cheesecake they offer. We ordered the raspberry cheesecake and a Tiramisu cheesecake to go. I haven't tasted it yet but no doubt it's going to be really good. One cheesecake I would recommend that I've tried is the red velvet cheesecake, very high in calories I believe it's at 2100 cal but it's so good so share with somebody.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=80

The waitress was also very efficient. I ordered a lunch-size salad. The ingredients were fresh, the portion was huge, and the dish tasted very good. I got the worth of the money spent.  As compared to the hostess at the front desk, our waitress was basically doing her job but her non-verbal communication conveyed a sense of unfriendliness in a very subtle manner. She did all the necessary actions, such as taking our orders, replacing a knife that was dirty to begin with and saying sorry about that, asking how we were doing every now and then even when the place was very busy. However, her facial expression and the way she spoke (sort of in a relatively cold manner) conveyed the unfriendly tone underneath. It  could be that, she was in a bad mood herself yesterday and this had nothing to do with us. I do not know whether she realized what her own non-verbal communication was saying to the customers or not.

Ian A.,"Sacramento, United States",0,5,3,2.0,31/7/2017,"I have been a fan of the TCK establishment for a while. One of my favorite dishes is the Beef Pit Dip where at every location my Beef Pit Dip is served with the typical arrangement of sandwich and au jus dipping broth. I don't know why this location on Arden Way did not follow through with this and essentially offended me when asking for help. Upon receiving my To-Go order and checking the contents, I saw that the sandwich's namesake was missing from the order, the au jus, leaving me with a dry sandwich of bread and meat and cheese (NOT a french dip). I contacted the location and they said I could fight for a refund. I said I only wanted to just stop by and pick up my au jus dipping broth which is typically part and parcel of the ""french dip"" experience that I have come to know from The Cheesecake Factory. When I arrived, I was told to stand to the side and wait for my au jus. After 20-25 minutes of waiting, a waitress comes from the back and before walking towards me turns to some holier-than-thou manager types and they collectively give me a good look.  The waitress then approaches me with a small plastic container, say 1 ounce to 2 ounce condiment container with a brown liquid and says, ""Here is your au jus"".  1) I asked if customers of The Cheesecake Factory are to dip their Beef Pit Dip sandwich into this, she said yes. 2) I asked her why I couldn't have a small soup container with the au jus broth or french onion broth, she shrugged. 3) I asked her if this was the same broth, she said yes.  4) I asked her why the liquid was cold to the touch, she shrugged. Excited to receive my sandwich, I saw I was missing an integral part. When I contacted the establishment about this they said to fight for a refund; I offered to just pickup some au jus instead, which they agreed to. When I got to the location, I was told to wait 20-25 min and was studied by managers. When I received what I hoped was my au jus, it was a small 1-2oz container of cold brown liquid. I left the brown liquid with the waitress and returned to my dry ruined order 40 minutes later. Unfortunately, I have experienced better from The Cheesecake Factory.

I ordered the tomato basil pasta which was good and a good portion my friend ordered the enchiladas which was okay wasn't that great.

Although the server only came back with all but the salted caramel which I just let it go cause while waiting for the check I managed to finish the mango key lime pie (couldn't resist). The tiramisu cakes didn't look at all appealing therefore I returned it requesting for one that would look edible like the other desserts I got. And keep in mind I have ordered the tiramisu dessert before. He returned it back with the same exact cakes and this time the cakes were worst and it was just a mess in the box. So I walked over and ask politely to take it off my bill I didn't expect him to holler over to the pastry workers to point out Im the one who decline to his cake. I was in shocked I could not believe this server Luis m. Would point out loud and clear in front of me that I am the person who doesn't want the desserts.. I will think twice about coming back.

We ordered and split a Greek salad ,chicken Medea, and a tiramisu cheesecake. Everything was delicious. I would differently return and order everything again.

You get to your table and the menu im not kidding, is 11 pages long. They must have at least 150 dinner dishes to pick from. The free bread was the most flavorful and fullfilling thing here even though its fairly small you find yourself just waiting for them to bring you more free bread.  Wife had meatloaf and I had a burger.  Both were about as untriumphant and a letdown, as a cat taking a piss on your blanket. Oh wait the dessert cant be bad right? Wrong!

Started with a $9.50 Sangria which was pretty watered down or cut with a mixer, or the ice. Sucked that down in about 2 min. Then had the chopped chicken salad which was very nice and refreshing. Be sure to get the dressing on the side. The main part of the meal was the Hibachi steak. Very flavorfull, but tiny portions of actual meat. Now I remember why everyone comes here.

Fire Roasted Chile Relleno:  Extra Yumm-O!  This was my favorite dish of the night.  I love Chile Rellenos which I order frequently when I go to a Mexican restaurant, but the dish at Cheesecake Factory was heightened to another level and one of the best I have tasted.  It was crispy and flavorful.  There was also a hint of mild heat which I enjoy.  Fried Macaroni and Cheese:  I'm not a fan of Mac & Cheese, but these fried cheese balls were filled with perfectly cooked pasta and cheesy deliciousness. Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese:  Sweet and tangy flavor over a thin crust of crispy flat bread. Crispy Crab Bites:  Yumm-O!  What can I say? Mahi Mahi & Shrimp Vera Cruz:  My friend ordered an entree from the SkinnyLicious Menu.  The fish and shrimp were perfectly cooked, and the flavor profile for the entire dish was superb.  Perfect dish as an appetizer for two if you're sharing. Aside from the food, it was amazing to watch how the employees were coordinating with each other to get a table set up for the next customer.  Efficient and flawless!  Take time to observe these worker bees in action if you have not already because they work hard to make our experience pleasant.  Way to go, Cheesecake Factory!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=380

The menu is only 20 pages long""  both dishes went back with only a few bites taken out. No better feeling. The waitress also said the fish is fresh daily.  Which is not true.

Jeremy S.,"Sacramento, United States",0,10,,4.0,24/6/2017,"Dined in last night at about 9:45, our waitresses name was Lisa, if I remember correctly. She was an excellent waitress, she visited our table a handful of times throughout the dining experience. She wasn't overwhelming nor was she leaving anything to be desired. I made sure to ask her name and tell her myself she was a great waitress. The food is always good here, I feel they're a bit on the pricey side, but oh well, I keep coming back don't I? My girlfriend got the Cajun jambalaya pasta and I got the pepperoni pizza. She said her dish was fine and mine was okay it's not that it wasn't made good, but it wasn't made to my particular liking. I'm more of a thicker crust, a bit more sauce, lighter cheese kind of guy. I typically get their spicy buffalo chicken sandwich and it's always perfect, but this time I tried something different, so now I know to go with my usual entree. Like I said, the pizza wasn't bad at all, it's just not how I like my pizza. Let me note that this particular trip here was 5 stars, but the reason I am giving 4 stars overall is because my first time being here a couple years back I was with a couple friends and I felt like we were being profiled based on appearance (tattoos, baggy clothes, etc.) So that definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for a while then I decided to give it a second go-round and have been satisfied ever since.

Hi I'm Cameron F.,"Sacramento, United States",0,2,,2.0,18/1/2016,"In  my attempt to find a place that was open later on a Sunday and served a wide variety of foods we ended up here.I wanted to go to the Porch,... The Food ar Cheesecake Factory generally consists of frozen and fried.They plate the food for the most part.Frozen,fried foods.There is no ""whole foods"" going on back there.The chef's quickly add on the fresh veggies. We orders several appetizers/small plates. We had an order of Chicken pot stickers,and an order of their spin on a Cubano sandwich,fried and presented  like a spring roll, served with some sort of  mayo dip.We had their Samosas,Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, and I ordered a Beets with goat cheese salad. We ordered various entrées. I felt bad for my sister in law,eating fish at that place.I would ONLY eat fresh fish.I'm just saying! The issue with the cake and the service! There is no need to say on your birthday,you just want to relax and have a nice evening with your family and friends.You have a  service expectation.When you manage to make everyone  want to leave,that's just not the experience you signed up for. We had a special bithday cake made at a bakery in Oakland,a Tres Leche cake.Nearly any restaurant will charge a fee if you bring outside food or drink. No problem! However,they are still supposed  to serve it to us!  My parents gave the cake with basic instructions,. (Like, please serve this ), and our name on it when we arrived.My family spoke with our waitress as we were seated. I have ate there several times.I have had 2 bad dining experiences there.This was by far the worst of both negative dining experiences there. After dinner,we waited for approximately 30 minutes talking,waiting.I was nervous  they would sing happy birthday to me.No cake came.No waitress.Finally my mom checked,  and they forgot about the cake.They brought the orders of  strawberries we ordered.Some of our party wanted ice cream and she never came back.My father wanted to complain to managment but I just wanted to leave. For nearly a 30 minutes we sat there talking,no one asked if we wanted coffee,or any other dessert items.She did not come to check on us once.We would question if they were get the cake and then that turned into did she forget about the cake.Again,she did not come back to check on us.My mom had to fo find somone. The cake was dropped of at our table.It was not cut, nor did they give us anything to cut the cake with, or clean plates.They should have brought the cake over,on a cake tray, OUT of the box.Or, asked us if they were not sure.An apology for our wait and for their mistake would have been apprexiated.This qualifies for HORRIBLE SERVICE. I will say this,typically their service is better than this.I have had pretty good service.This is my second encounter with a lousy waitress or waiter there,but she was by far the worst.She certainly needs more training,but the manager/supervisor also needs to be aware of what is going on in the restaurant too. The service of the waitress was rude.I noticed it right away She was not friendly,she had an attitude.She dis not check on us.She did not ask us if we wanted more of the bread.She seemed very distracted.Her service not only did not meet my expectations,for my birthday.She managed to upset everyone there,with her rude personality,lack of service as no show, for my cake as we waited. No one ordered drinks of more deserts when they finally appeared.They  just wantes to have the cake and LEAVE.Everyone was angry that she forgot to give us the cake and kept us waiting. Food,frozen and fried.This okay plated frozen foods.There is no ""whole foods"" going on back there. Basically frozen food.The ""chefs"" add on the veggies.Most of the appetizers/small plates  are  frozen/fried. We had an order of chicken pot stickers,and an order of their spin on a Cubano sandwich,fried and presented  like a spring roll, served with a mayo dip.We had their Samosas,Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, and I ordered a small beets with goat cheese salad. We ordered various entrées. I felt bad for my sister in law,eating fish at that place.I would ONLY eat fresh fish.I'm just saying.  The food is just not for me. No more Cheesecake Factory.DONE. 2 stars for previous good service,but the stars are also a reflection of terrible service.The service realy matters.It was my birthday.You forgot to bring my cake!

I tend to avoid Cheesecake Factory right around dinner-time just because it always means a wait.  However, if you come later on in the night, especially on weeknights, there usually will be a number of open tables.  My boyfriend and I usually will pick out a cheesecake from the display and share a piece. On our last visit, we shared the Mango Key-lime cheesecake.  It had a nice (kind of different) tartness to it.  It was worth a try, but not as great as other cheesecakes I've had there.  What I like about the Cheesecake Factory is that there are always new flavor combinations of cheesecakes available.  My boyfriend and I really like to try new things, rather than just sticking with what we've had before, so this is a great way to try new desserts/cheesecakes. Notes: -If you don't want to wait, you can order a slice of cheesecake to go.  They package it nicely and still give you plenty of whipped cream. -There is plenty of parking because it's located in a giant parking lot.  They even have valet parking if you're interested.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=580

I loved the classic burger with mesclun salad on the side- a great deal for $10.95. Would go back again- and I really do need to try the cheesecake!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=580

They made my experience at the Cheesecake Factory very pleasant. Why I rate a 5 is because service is very important to me. I'm not going to blame the waitress for my food not tasting right, it's how they approached the situation & fixed the problem. Love the cheesecake!

Lizette R.,"Davis, United States",178,105,198,4.0,4/3/2015,We all know their cheesecake is amazing!!!!! But did you also know their hamburgers are so so good? I didn't either! My boyfriend and I recently dined here. He ordered the all american burger and I ordered spring rolls (big mistake). His plate was obviously more appetizing than my plate.  My plate was dry and boring. What was I thinking ordering spring rolls here! I could probably make better spring rolls than the ones they served me. However their strawberry martini was delicious!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=580
Cici F.,"Rancho Cordova, United States",61,21,174,4.0,29/4/2013,"Oh Yes....I was very satisfied! Mmm mm mm!!!  If you've never been to Cheesecake Factory I suggest that you try their Chicken Madeira...it never disappoints! And it shouldn't being that it costs $17.95. The positive side of that price is that its enough for 2 people to eat! As a matter of fact..even their ""lunch"" size meals are enough for 2 to share (if you don't want it all for yourself like me).  This meal is so good that it even made the nuked Styrofoam plate that I warmed the leftovers on taste good! (I don't advise you to use Styrofoam plates...it may not be too healthy for ya to intake but in this instance I COULD CARE LESS! Nom nom nom :)  The service was great! We got plenty of refills of the complimentary bread and butter so we didn't even bother to order appetizers. Its located outside of Arden Mall (duh) so be prepared for there to be a crowd. We went around 5pm on a Sunday and for a party of 4, we didn't have but a 5 minute wait to be seated. That's awesome! This is a go to place for a nice family experience. And we always leave with doggy bags. So if the price scares you (about $64.00 to feed 4 people, that's without ordering dessert. We were too full), just know that you are pretty much getting two meals in one. So CHILL! :) All in all, it was a good experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=580

We literally waited for 2 hours....  Their menu is really big and has lots of choices. It took me a while to order.... The waiter was nice about it or at least looked like he was. I ordered a burger and from the menu it sounded good.. But it turned out to be very dry.. The food here is NOT worth the wait!!! It was my cousins birthday so we told the waiter after we ordered. Hoping he would bring a desert after dinner. Not only did he forget... But it was not complimentary. It was 8$ for a cheesecake. Jeez...  Nice place to go if you want to be fancy but not really worth it. Id rather take my money somewhere else.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=580

Tiffany K.,"Sacramento, United States",812,1020,303,4.0,4/4/2011,"Maybe I'm flogging a dead horse, 'cause 22 of my best Yelpie friends have already said their two cents about the Cheesecake Factory. HOWEVER none of them mentioned the Happy Hour which is Monday-Friday from 4:00 - 6:00.  Call me uneducated, but I never really thought of a place called 'Cheesecake Factory' to have a killer happy hour. The appetizer portions are full sized which means you could totally make a meal out of these things! Sure they are deep fried and probably contain a gazillion calories, but they sure go nicely with a $5 Cosmo.  What I can recall from the $5 appetizer menu: * Deep friend avocado rolls - I have been told that these are fantastic * Fried Macaroni & Cheese cubes * Calamari - very tender, great aioli sauce * Sweet corn tamale cakes * Buffalo Blasts - rice paper wrapped spicy chicken that is (you guessed it) deep fried * Fried chicken sliders Drink-wise, they had long islands, margaritas, cosmpolitans, etc. all for $5. They make great drinks too!  So yeah, it is a chain, but for a chain, the service is good, the food is good (huge portions!) and the ambiance - while a bit over the top - is nice. Looking around, you had your office parties, birthday dinners, families, couples and dates. My friend Theresa had the Red Velvet Cheesecake.

Emerald M.,"Sacramento, United States",8,2,,1.0,3/11/2017,"Doesn't even deserve one star. Honestly at first I wasn't even that mad. Basically online order was messed up and I thought I would just call and they would offer to remake it and I could go pick it up for dinner after work. However what upset me was the way this was handled - so unprofessional and lazy. This WAS a door dash order so I get that the money is handled through Door Dash- fine. You would think though, that since CHEESECAKE FACTORY'S employee is the one who royally messed up the salad, they would take responsibility. But no. Door dash is responsible for the delivery and they did great - arrived early, no hassle... The restaurant is supposed to know how to make their own food. I ordered The Vegan Cobb salad and not only did it have CHEESE (hello...not vegan) but it had two other items it was NOT supposed to have. Also, it was MISSING 5 major items which made up the bulk of the salad -  almonds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, garbanzo beans, and avocado were all missing. When I called and spoke with the hostess she was really nice but then gave me to the manager, Dandy. Dandy was super inflexible, took no responsibility, did not apologize or offer any compensation just kept saying I had to go through door dash. I was *not asking him to give me my money back* all I wanted was for it to be remade. When I asked him for his name he hung up on me. I called back and called him out on it. He denied it. I finally got his name and the name of his manager - gave me the CEO of Cheesecake Factory - David Overton... don't tell me you don't have a manager besides the CEO geez.

Jean S.,"Sacramento, United States",203,245,1453,4.0,1/8/2015,"Our service was top notch! I came here on National Cheesecake Day (7/30) and was seated outside. Our server, Costas, was super friendly, helpful, patient, and had an all-around genuine and positive attitude. The service he provided was fantastic, definitely one of the best service experiences I've had.  The Cheesecake Factory now has a new superfoods menu! Perfect, since healthy eating has been making trends lately and people are more conscious of the foods they are eating. I ordered the almond-crusted salmon salad - pan seared salmon over a salad of kale, brussel sprouts, arugula, avocado, quinoa, cranberries, radishes, and vinaigrette dressing. The salmon was very tender and delicious. The kitchen forget to include the avocado, but our server brought some on the side. Apparently the new menu has only been out for a week so the kitchen was not super familiar with it yet.  I guess after eating a super good food, it's time to eat the super bad food...yet also super good in its own way. The Oreo cheesecake...aka Oreo Dream Extreme is my favorite and I just cannot order any other! Although many other flavors taste good, no other can match the rich, decadent, awesomeness of the Oreo cheesecake. I've been to Cheesecake Factory at least 3 times this year and probably 5 times within the last couple years and each time I've ordered the Oreo cheesecake. I've have tried the tiramisu, s'mores, and chocolate cheesecake, which are all good, but still love the Oreo best. In previous visits, I've had the herb crusted salmon, chicken marsala pasta, and a cheeseburger. The herb salmon was really tender and perfect, the chicken marsala pasta was flavorful and delicious, but the burger was not good. The burger was dry and plain tasting, definitely not their specialty. Also on the negative side, the prices are a tad bit high and there can be a long wait for a table. But overall the food at the Cheesecake Factory is above average, the service is excellent, and the cheesecake can't be beat!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=140

One time I came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday and they had a great experience, we all ordered pasta dishes too. For drinks, I tried the J.W. Pink Lemonade and it was okay. For dessert, we got the tiramisu and it was my first time eating it. Our server forgot my dad's cappucino, so I had to remind her, and she didn't check up on us as much as she could have, but I understand since I'm also a server at a busy restaurant. The portions are absolutely huge, so the prices are reasonable. Unfortunately, I don't really like cheesecake (definitely I'm in the minority here), but I come here for the pasta dishes and yummy appetizers.  I recently came here about a week ago with my best friend (after an exhausting adventure of finding Christmas gifts) and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. When we were seated, we were immediately greeted by our server and ordered drinks. I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my best friend got another pasta dish, but I forgot what it was. We both enjoyed our dishes and our server came by regularly to refill our drinks and check up on us and our meal. However, midway through our dining experience, our server just disappeared and was nowhere to be found, but that's okay, because another server noticed or either took over, and took good care of my best friend and I whenever we needed anything like drink refills or boxes and the check. Overall, the food is great and the service is always on point even when it's super busy! Definitely recommend this place.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=140

Loki N.,"Sacramento, United States",2,115,,2.0,13/8/2016,"Had lunch the other day with girlfriend. Had been a long time since I ate at one and desserts looked SO tempting. Played it safe and ordered a hot tea with lunch special of soup, salad and half a turkey sandwich. Soup was baked potato and it was delicious, having been sprinkled with crumbled bacon bits, green onions and drizzle of sour cream. Made a perfect match when dipping bread from their breadbasket into it. Loved every single drop! The salad turned out to a disappointment. Mixed greens with maybe, MAYBE a tsp of blue cheese dressing tossed with it. At least the greens were fresh but there was nothing added to it. Not abit of cheese, even croutons, nothing! Just greens with the measly tsp of dressing on it... The sandwich was some fresh sliced turkey on a roll with tomato and lettuce. The turkey was fresh and tasty but that was about it. My friend ordered the same thing and said it was only ok. We split a slice of the Kahlua chocolate cheesecake and that was wonderfully rich and sinful! Our server was okay at first but once we got our food, she was nonexistent! We had to ask for a refill of my hot water from someone else and we never got a refill on our ice water. We had to ask for a takeout box and we felt rushed and like we didn't exist. Ok I get you are busy and want to turn your table but rudeness shouldn't be rewarded tip wise. I really wanted to say some great things about it but this place sadly isn't much more than an overpriced Denny's. Lots of people seemed happy to be there so good for them, I'm happy for you, but I give one star for the soup and Kahlua cheesecake and one star for the fact a lot of people were happily celebrating special events. However, poor waitress service won't have me returning nor will I recommend it to others. Take your dining dollars and find somewhere else or get it to go if their food is your thing. Sorry folks.... PROS: Delish baked potato soup and chocolate Kahlua cheesecake. CONS: Poor waitress service soured the majority of our visit and lackluster overly priced food made this a Failure of the day for us.

The Pro's of our evening:  The Food and drinks were AWESOME! We order: *Strawberry Cheesecake * Red Velvet Cheesecake **Chicken Samosas *Appetizer Caesar Salad (that was more than enough for two maybe even three people to share) *A Mint Mojito *And a Passion Mojito (SUPER DELICIOUS) All that for $57 bucks NOT BAD AT ALL AND VERY FILLING!  Now lets discuss how Luis put a damper on the evening, the ONLY reason I gave 3 stars was I normally receive GREAT service, my company and the food we ate was great HOWEVER the overall dining experience was definitely dampened by our server.

I guess I wouldn't be as irritated if he didn't ensure he checked on the needs of the not one but two birthday table full of of ladies... guess what creeper you're loosing out on this table's tip!  Speaking of birthday, I asked before we even received our menus that they come over and sing happy birthday to my friend and THAT never happened but the perv sure made sure the table of ladies was taken care of with their birthday song. Ugh RUDE! Whats worst. He bought our cheesecake and left for five minutes..... Anyone want to guess what critical piece he left off.... go ahead I'll wait....that's right he FINALLY came back and asked how everything was and if we needed anything um yea dummy, something TO EAT MY $10 cheesecake with! -_- To which he responded oh I'm so sorry!

I kindly told him I was still eating THANKS and continued about my evening. After bring the bill and the to go boxes I KID YOU not my date barely got his cheesecake onto the plate and was seconds away from scooping his dollop of whip cream into his box when this tad grabbed his plate by then I was SO frustrated that I spoke up and let him know WHOA still boxing.

Well...my water was full, the bread kept coming and my belly was full! Service: The service was not bad, however since we were in the back, there was not a lot of attend towards us. This could be good or bad, if you want the privacy.  Surprisingly when we went the line was not long at all. 10 min max which is decent from what I remember from before! I remember having to wait 30 min+ sometimes which is a big turn off! Just note that if you plan on going on the weekends expect that long of a wait.  Dish: Bistro shrimp pasta + Cajun jambalaya pasta Lots of spices! many flavors, but could have been more! it looks rich in the sauce however it tasted a  little more bland then it looked =(. I have had this dish before and it did taste much better than the last time I went and I feel in love with the dish then. I guess it really depends on the cook.

It had goat cheese, beets, arugula and perfectly ripe tomatoes on a bed of faro all dressed in the same perfect dressing. I know  I'm going to order that salad for as long as its on the menu.

Chris S.,"Sacramento, United States",2,34,32,4.0,20/3/2015,"I usually don't leave reviews for chain restaurants but this will be the exception. I can't say enough about The Cheesecake Factory. The service is good, the menu is huge, and the food always tastes great. I have to say though, I was a bit disappointed today during my visit. Of the many delicious menu items that are served here, there is one entrée in particular that I order just about all of the time. The infamous Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich. This thing is killer. I flipped through the menu today as we sat down for a quick lunch, and I couldn't find the darn thing. So then I asked our server as she was ready to take our order and she gave me the news that I knew I'd be dreading. They no longer serve it. Ouch...heartbreaker. So I guess it's on to the next best thing, their Chicken Madeira. There's not too much to say about it other than the obvious, it's absolutely delicious. Chicken breast draped with cheese and sautéed mushrooms, lounging in a pool of their Madeira wine sauce. It also comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. What was also cool was that I told our server that my wife and I would be splitting the entrée, so they served it on two separate plates. I know it doesn't sound like a big deal but a lot of restaurants would just bring you an extra plate and have you split it up yourself. If you're a chocolateholic like myself forget the calories and give the Godiva chocolate cheesecake a try and you won't regret it. Overall this place is terrific. From appetizers, to salads, to entrees, to desserts, there's something for everyone here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=640

Sarah B.,"Galt, United States",56,203,61,3.0,24/3/2013,"Why only three stars? Well, here are a few reasons I'm not a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory.  -Their menu. Why is it so big???? I can never decide because the dang thing is 20 pages long, then I forget I'm looking at a menu because I start to think I'm flipping through a magazine with a bunch of advertisements.  -The wait. I swear no matter what time of day or day of the week there is like a MINIMUM 30 minute wait. I don't mind waiting, but at a place so big and place that I don't understand why it's so popular, the wait irritates me. -The service. I have never experienced stellar service here. Not bad service, just not really good service. Sometimes I wonder if the employees are just overwhelmed.  Now it's not all bad at the Cheesecake, their food is good. I don't think I have ever had anything bad there. The food always seems fresh and is well made. And let's not forget the cheesecake. They have the best cheesecake ever! My favorite being the white chocolate raspberry with the chocolate crust.  One last good thing: it's fun to celebrate here with a large group.

It was busy but we sat in the bar because there was no wait. The hostess' were very nice. We sat down at our hi top table and after 5 minutes our waiter came to the table. He did not greet us, but went straight to asking us what we wanted to drink. I felt like he was trying to rush us out. He then left, returned with our drinks and some bread. We were not given any utensils, napkins, or plates for the bread. We ordered two appetizers so I was thinking oh maybe he forgot and will bring the plates and utensils with the apps. The apps were brought by some other severs who were nice. Our waiter only came by to refill our drinks and take the menus because we were still deciding on which cheesecake to order. We ordered the cheesecake and he took our menus. He could clearly see that we did not have any plates and we were eating our hot buffalo strips with our hands. We had to use our menus to eat our bread off of. He didn't really help us much. He helped the other tables around us. I looked all around and all of the tables had utensils and plates.

First item is the RANCH HOUSE BURGER (Pieces of Steak, Sauteed Mushrooms and Onions, Crisp Bacon and Cheddar Cheese on Top of Our Classic Burger. Served with Fries). It was one of the most memorable burgers I've had the pleasure of eating. It was incredibly juicy, cooked with a little pink just like I asked, piping hot when I received it, bun toasted just right, tender little pieces of steak on top, and absolutely delectable. One the downside I added 10 to my cholesterol reading. The second item is the appetizer sampler (""Factory Appetizer Favorites"").  Great way for 2 people to sample a bunch tantalizing little treats. The item I remember the most was the avocado egg rolls. I loved the combination of ingredients in there, including cilantro and sun dried tomatos. The dipping sauce was excellente.

Ok, I lied, left 1 spoonful of mashed potatoes on the plate. boo hoo hoo... 3. a glass of The Cheesecake Factory Cabernet Sauvignon      -I liked this. A little sweet blend.

I was super thirsty and ordered the New Castle on tap and my-oh-my this was super cold and super yummy!!! I love it when I find a place that serves their beer ICE cold.  I quickly slurped that bad boy down.  My gf is not a big beer drinker, and when I let her tasted mine, she was impressed and subsequently ordered her own.  (You can see how frosty their beer is by the metal ""pipes"" if you will, leading to the tap is frosty-frozen.) We got served some warm bread with butter before dinner.  And may I say that there is a lost art of having warm bread served at restaurants these days it seems.  Sure, I don't need the extra carbs (who does), but damn...I love the dark bread and the sourdough isn't half bad either!  She ordered the blackened Jamaican shrimp with black beans and plantains.  I am not a shrimp person, but she said that it was heavenly!   I ordered a toss green salad, to get some vegetables in my diet that day with the house vinaigrette and it was spot on.  Sometimes the vinaigrette can be too acidic, but this one was perfect.  I also ordered the garlic spaghetti without meat and that was super tasty too.  Unfortunately neither of us had room for dessert...I know, I know...i know, how dare us go there without any cheese cake!   I'll be returning, initially for a frosty glass of new castle and then whatever tickles my fancy for eats!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=680

Seriously, I spent $50 on 6 different cheesecakes and a slice of their to-die-for Black Out Cake. Its layers of moist chocolate cake with truffle filling and even has chocolate chips in it with a layer of almonds on the outside.  I love their lunch selection because you can get half-portions of their pasta for half the price. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and every bite had peas with crispy bacon and creamy eggy sauce. The noodles were cooked perfectly and there was even enough sauce to take the complimentary french/rye bread and dip in.  The hostess/waitresses/waiters are all beautiful here too! They were super friendly and attentive to the tables. They didn't sneer when I wanted to share an entree with a friend for dinner last night. It was quite busy for a Monday night also, and if our waitress went on break, there would be another one coming along to inform us. The interior design is really homey feeling and alot more upscale.

Steaks not cooked properly I ordered my medium well and it was burned on one side. My dad actually had to have his steak taken back to be remade . On the plus side we did get a free dessert but seriously for the prices that customers are paying the food has to be prepared way better. My mashed potatoes and a wrapper in them which I didn't know until I got home and ate my left overs. The lemon sauce for the salmon is watery. Definitely not how the food used to be, maybe at a different location it'll be different but this one definitely needs new cooks/chefs ASAP I'm disgusted to even think about how the food is prepared no exaggeration.

She told me it would be 30 min to 40 minutes. When 40 minutes came and went, I went up to check with her. Rather than apologize for the extended wait, she informed me In a surly tone that we had ""only waited  44 minutes"". I consider this rude and, not in any sense, good customer service.

Their bread is amazing and we like to order extra for the table to take home with our leftovers! I love getting a burger here, they have many varieties and they are so good.  One time when we were here, we were not waiting an unusually long time for the food, but the manager came over and told us that they forgot to cook my burger and that it would be out in a minute and they would give us a complimentary dessert. It literally arrived as she was leaving, and like I said we werent even questioning when our food was going to come out yet. Then, at the end of the meal when we were paying, they gave us a survey code to go online and rate the service and we got a $10 coupon!! Not sure if this was a random survey or not, but I've gotten it one more time since then, and they are valid for several months afterward.  Great place to bring a date ;) If you have a large party, try to call in a reservation, or prepare to wait. If you dont mind sitting outside during winter, they can usually seat you right away.

We had good service considering it was a busy Friday night.  We would go back again, but probably only with a gift card or coupon - there are many more places we have never been that we are anxious to explore.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=620

Perfect for a casual or semi-fancy dinner.  FOOD: I mean it is alright. Super basic food in my opinion but how fancy can you get if you have 500 items on the menu? LOL. The food is decent, I always leave full. I actually really love the crab cakes here. Really decent for the price. I am glad I discovered them on my recent visit so now I can have something to look forward to when I get dragged here. BUT. The cheese cake is terrible. It tastes super processed which honestly broke my heart because I love cheesecake. You would think a place called ""Cheesecake Factory"" would be able to get at least the cheesecake right...sad sad sad.  SERVICE: The staff is always pretty good. You can tell they are well trained. One thing I love about CCF is that the staff wears all white. It makes me feel like they do their best to stay clean and be clean. Wearing all white just gives off a good impression. Also, I love that this place is open late.  Overall, I do not mind taking one for the team when I have to come here but I am always expecting average food...nothing spectacular.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=360

Linde H.,"Alameda, United States",352,181,138,4.0,20/9/2014,"I really really like this place.  Well, just cheesecake factories in general. Whenever I come here, I usually get too full off the bread and butter before I can even get to my meal. I do have a usual though, I drink the island ice tea with 2 packets of the sugar in the raw, then for pasta, I usually get the pasta da vinci or the louisiana chicken pasta. The pasta da vinci is so sweet, it has penne pasta and a creamy whine sauce with mushrooms and thinking about it right now makes my mouth water. The louisiana is creamy but has a little kick of spice in it topped chicken that's crispy till you get full and leave it in the fridge for the next day.  Leftovers aren't bad though folks. AND WHEN I'M FEELIN REAL FANCY, I get the key lime cheesecake after.

I ordered my favorite thing in the world: Fettucine Alfredo with Chicken.  Uh, yummmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  My eyes totally lit up when the food arrived. Yes, this place is a teensy-bit pricy. My dish was around $16+ and so are most others I've seen. But they give very generous food portions! It was so delicious (a bit oily though). I ended up forgetting to save room for one of their famous slice of cheesecake. Oh well, worth it.  I will definitely be back so I'm not too worried about missing out on dessert.

The appetizers are always delicious but my entrees either end up bring great, or I'm left dissatisfied and un impressed.  I went this past Friday and I must say that I left dissatisfied. Server took forever to bring the bread, and when she did it was extremely hard! When my friend told her the bread was pretty hard her response was ""That's how it's supposed to be."" We were both in shock and disgusted at her attitude. We both ordered pasta dishes, he got the Cajun Chicken Pasta which was good, and I had the Chicken Pasta with Scampi Sauce. I've had this dish before and it was full of flavor, however, this time the sauce was flavorless and my pasta was a bit dry. I asked for some extra sauce and the server again gave me an attitude. I work in customer service so when I ask for something or bring something to someones attention I'm always pleasant and professional. This gal just had an attitude.  I will say .... for an appetizer .... I highly recommend the Firecracker Salmon! It's always delicious, flavorful, and not too heavy, so it leaves room for all the food they give you as an entree. Because of the poor service this time....we didn't even want to stay for dessert.

I've been to a few and they're fairly consistent but this one rates below average.  The amount of flies around our table was just creepy  (and nooo smarty-pants they didn't follow us in).  After looking under the table of our booth we realized that the flies were hovering around due to all the snackins that were lying around by our feet.  I can't imagine a large chain restaurant like this wouldn't sweep at least once a day so I can only assume this was from the brunch crowd that came before us. The server was pretty cheesy.  He would probably be fine for a table with a bunch of kids but it was just my boyfriend and I so not really a good fit. On the plus side, the avocado egg rolls were fresh and had a nice crunch to them. I enjoyed the salad, which was micro greens with balsamic, not that horrible mix of iceberg and carrot slivers that passes for a house salad at many establishments. The pizza can take a hike though.

We came on a Monday evening and were seated right away. We had a party of 8 but 4 of the members didn't join us until desert. They sat us in the bar area because of this (dumb!) My friend got the Twisted Pretzel drink for his first legal drink. It was amazing. It tasted a lot like a milk shake with chunks of pretzels and vodka. He also got a peach drink, not sure of the name. Both drinks were $10. Not sure they were worth $10 but I have to admit that Twisted Pretzel was awesome. We all shared the avocado egg rolls ($9.99) it was a large appetizer. Lots of avocado, they certainly don't skimp. This place is pretty pricey. Most of the entrees are $12+. I have to say though the portions are huge. I ordered the Shepherds Pie. It was so good except not enough mashed potato for the meat mixture. My fiancé got the Carlson Salad. It had a lot of different fruits and cheese on it. He said it was good. He didn't finish it though. My friend got the Grilled Salmon and it was delicious. They cooked the salmon well and paired it with awesome mashed potatoes. It lay on a corn salsa. His girlfriend got the Hibachi Steak. It was presented really nicely. Again, LARGE portion. For desert we both got the Snickers Cheesecake ($6.99) it was so expensive and so crazy good. The top is layered with chopped up snicker bars. The crust is crushed cookies and then it's drizzled with chocolate sauce and caramel. Oh it was so good.  So after a good dinner why did I dock 2 stars? Well.. THE SERVICE SUCKED!!!! It was so freaking slow! We ended up having 2 waitresses because one had to go to lunch (understandable) BUT they didn't communicate with each other so the order got delayed 20 minuets. Our dinner took 2 hours for 4 people. The other 4 of our party joined us as we were eating and had to wait forever to get dessert menus. It was just ridiculous.

I met a friend here for lunch on a Monday, and the place wasn't too busy and we only had about a fifteen minute wait which isn't bad for a restaurant that seems to be very popular.   We were seated in a booth and were greeted by the most BLANDEST waiters ever.  He seriously didn't have a personality or was just having a bad day and didn't want to work.  Oh well.  My friend and I both ordered a strawberry lemonade (totally hit the spot) and my friend ordered the chicken fettucine and I ordered the chicken enchiladas.  I wasn't expecting much since this place seems to have such a vast menu and definitely didn't specialize in enchiladas.  However, I was quite surprised at how tasty they were.  I was served three decent sized enchiladas topped with melted cheeses and a side of black beans and rice.  My friend, although he ordered the half size of the fettucine, received quite a large portion as well.  Maybe that's why everyone loves this place - great portions!  My enchiladas were so good that I would definitely order them again. What I like most about The CF is that the place is huge and spacious.  The menu is another plus because literally anyone could find something on the menu to their liking.  They have a bit of everything:  burgers, pastas, sandwiches, ethnic foods, etc.  I think I may be back in the future to explore the menu a little more.  Even our boring and slow waiter didn't ruin my experience.  Nice!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=720

Firstly, their soda mix was off, so the soda was flat and syrup-y, which as a person who enjoys soda, I found very annoying. I politely informed the waitress, but she did not seem to care. Secondly, the person who brought out the food, likely a manager of some sort, asked if I wanted ketchup and then brought some. It reminded me of the awful ketchup I had in middle school when the school tried to save money by buying canned generic ketchup and adding water to it.

Kaitlyn B.,"Reno, United States",0,13,1,3.0,9/8/2014,"After having been to many a Cheesecake Factory my expectations were set rather high. The quality of the food and the service had never disappointed me, until now. Upon arriving we had a short wait which was nice but once seated we tried to order and unfortunately they were out of the fried macaroni that goes on the macaroni and cheese burger we tried to order. Who knows the circumstances that allowed this to happen so we were gracious and looked for something new to try. The americano burger was alright but nothing compared to our usual order of the mac and cheese burger. My personal favorite the crispy chicken costaletta is usual so spectacular I cannot wait to return and have it again. This time was a let down. While the food was still good it was not ""cheesecake factory quality"". Our server Shannon was attentive and very friendly, nothing to complain about there. We got desserts and they were very good. Overall I left bummed because my food didn't live up to the quality I had received at previous visits to cheesecake factory.  We will not be revisiting this location again but still want to give other locations a chance.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=740

Marie N.,"Sacramento, United States",317,272,129,4.0,16/5/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is kind of hit or miss for me.  The last time I went (to the Roseville location) I had a disappointing experience with food and drinks. I went to dinner with a few friends on Friday, and this time the experience was great!  We got a table for 4 at 7:30 and had barely a 10 minute wait, which was kind of miraculous judging from the packed parking lot and people waiting to be seated in front of us.  Drinks and food were also prompt and normally you have to wait a while because everyone is trying to get through the ginormous menu.  For appetizers we ordered: Avocado Eggrolls (very tasty) Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll (UH-MAZING! My favorite!  Definitely recommend getting this for an appetizer!) Crispy Crab Wontons  (Good but nothing special, however the sauce that came with it was killer!) Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls (Average) I took a friend's recommendation and ordered the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean for my entree and I was so far from disappointed!  Tender fish on top of creamy red mashed potatoes, topped with warm tomatoes and a fresh basil sauce drizzled over everything.  It was outstanding!   My sister had to send back her dish because it was a bit on the cold side, and she felt a little bad.  Our server was totally apologetic and polite about it though.  A manager even delivered a fresh replacement dish to her and the 2nd time around it was amazing.   I wish I could remember our server's name because she was really gave spot-on service.  This CF is definitely a place I'll be coming back to.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=740

It was too late for us to go out for dinner, and we didn't feel like staying up and waiting for a table. We decided to head back to our hotel (Doubletree, Sacramento) and just unwind and relax from the day's activities.  Still, I was hungry, and wanted something to eat. Used my Yelp app on my iPhone to see what was nearby, there was a Cheesecake factory listed. I asked my family if they wanted anything to go from CF, and they did. Also called our the other family we were traveling with, and also wanted to me to get something for them.  Pretty straightforward. Call them up and place your order. After waiting the allowed preparation time, waited at a specially-designated parking spot for to go orders. Called the front desk to tell them I was there, and they came by with my orders. They took my credit card, and later returned for me to sign.  Pretty painless.  We ordered:  -Two Cobb salads: can't comment, it was for our friends, but each was a sizable portion.  -Four Cheese Pasta: My oldest daughter's favorite. Penne pasta with mozzarella, ricotta, romano and parmesan, marinara sauce and basil. Came with a side of garlic bread. True to CF, this was a pretty large portion. Still hot from my pick up, and good.  -CF Club: Nicely arranged in the take out container. Turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. Came with side of fries. Sandwich was nice and moist, and yes, very big. Can't say much about the fries, because the kids ate them all before I could take a bite.  -Key Lime cheesecake: couldn't resist, had to get dessert. Slightly tart, refreshing, yet so smooth and rich.  The Cheesecake Factory's to go service came to the rescue that night.

I love ALL the Cheescake Factories actually.I have eaten at the one in Vegas, Palm Springs, Sacramento, and San Jose. But my review is for specifically this location.  I was here last Friday night. As usual the wait times are extremley long, but it was I think, 7:30 p.m and the hostess told us it would be 15-20 min. Cool. It was just the two of us so thats probably why. We made a way to the bar and it was definately busy but we found a spot. The bartender was super nice and the drinks were AMAZING. I ordered the passionfruit mojito and my boyfriend ordered some kind of peach smoothie type drink. I admit, I have never ordered alcohol when I come here, my favorite is the passion fruit ice tea and the boyfriend gets the strawberry lemonade. But after tasting their real drinks, I am now questioning why I haven't ordered them before.  Our little buzzer thing buzzed and we were sat promptly, we got sat in a booth inside and it was pretty private. I normally sit outside but we were hungry so we chose best available. We ordered the artichoke cheese dip as an appetizer and waited to order our dinner. The boyfriend ordered the gumbo and I ordered my favorite Pasta Da Vinci. And we ordered a side of sweet pototoes just cause we like them lol.  Service was pretty good, the waitress probably could have been friendlier but she was still on point and had everything we requested, even when she went on her break, we got a replacement waistress and she was really nice and friendly and was very prompt as well.  Now the best part...the Cheescake!!! We ordered ours to go, because we had so much food we couldn't eat all of it, so when we went back to our room and just rested, an hour later we dove right in. We orderd the one that wasn't on the menu, the Pina Colada. Let me tell you it was the BEST cheesecake I have tasted from here, it seriously surpassed all the previous Cheesecake Factory experiences, it was that good. It had a like pineapple cheescake filling with a custard and a coconut cake, it was DIVINE and NOT overwhelming at all. As I am typing this, I am fantasizing about it now, lol.

It's probably because everything has so much butter and oil that it has to be good but at least it's not disgusting food. I've had almost one of every kind of food from pasta, chicken, burger, steak, to cheesecake. Their cheesecake really is good but I feel like they have cut down their slices in the past few years.

We were given bread, butter, and water. the brown bread (i forgot what its called) is DELICIOUS!!   i ordered from their 'SPECIAL"" menu tonight and the other time too. it was ehhh. tonight, i ordered some kind of steak and chop. i forgot the name, but it was on their separate menu it was $13.90. it said it was similar to their Angus steak, but uhh it was so NOT! it came with string beans and mash potato, and mushrooms.  FIRST bite of the mash potato-- HELLA SALTY! omg.. then i took a bite of the 'steak' and it was HELLA more SALTY than the mash potato. my friend who ordered the salmon that came with the mash potato said it was SALTY too. i felt like i was eating a spoonful of salt. -___- i was so thirsty. the ONLY clear tasting not too salty was the string beans.  the other time i ordered from their 'SPECIAL' menu-- it was some pasta plate..

Loved their blueberry cheesecake with white chocolate shaving!! First bite and I was in heaven. Their mango and apple pie cheesecake were also good.

My boyfriend and I came here last night to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. Much to our surprise we arrived to find it was National Cheesecake Day (1/2 price cheesecake for dine-in customers).  When I walked in, there was a line of at least 15-20 people ahead of me simply waiting to put their names on the list to be seated. I considered leaving just by seeing the line but decided to wait it out. When I got to the front, I was happily greeted by the hostess. Her mood was extremely cheery and bubbly despite all the chaos and the hectic work shift I'm sure she was having. She told me the wait time would be about 20-25 minutes and took my phone number so she could shoot me a text when my table was ready. How cool is that?! If there's a long wait, you can easily head over to Arden for a while and do some shopping and then just head back a few minutes before your estimated wait time is up without having to worry you'll deactivate the usual buzzers restaurants give you. Anyways, the wait was about 25 minutes as she said, not too bad for such a busy day. Very soon after we were seated, a worker brought us bread and then shortly after that we were greeted by our waiter. BIG shoutout to our waiter, Luis L, for being absolutely amazing. He kept my drink refilled at all times despite my immense thirst and my quick emptying of my glass, he was very friendly and always checked in on us to ensure we were doing well. I ordered the Chicken Madeira and my boyfriend ordered the California Cheesesteak. Both of us were extremely satisfied with our meals; taste, temperature and serving size were all on point. One of the best parts of the whole night  was being able to get two slices of cheesecake for the price of one (thanks National Cheesecake Day!)

Lor G.,"Carmichael, United States",0,42,8,2.0,11/6/2015,"I use to come here for their Skinnylicious herb crusted salmon salad served on a bed of baby greens with asparagus, tomato and tossed with their vinaigrette dressing. Today and the time before last, I have been very disappointed in the quality. They use to serve the salad with a freshly cooked salmon fillet. Now they actually state, 'Chilled Salmon' on their menu. Well, you know what that means! Cold salmon that has been sitting in the refrigerator (probably overnight). For $17 I expect fresh cooked salmon.... like right then, when I order it.  Since I have received the chilled salmon twice, I specifically asked the waiter to tell the cook in the back that I would like my salmon freshly prepared and not chilled.           Now my mama didn't raise no dumb bunny, and I know when I've been bamboozled. So, when my salad arrived, the salmon was room temp and dry as a piece of shoe leather. Which tells me that the cook took a piece of salmon out of the refrigerator and put it in the microwave to heat it up. I had to take sips of ice tea just to wash the dry (hard around the edges) Salmon down. I mentioned it to our waiter and he said that he specified ""freshly prepare salmon"" on the ticket and made special mention to the chef.  Chef! Really? There IS a difference between a chef and a short order cook, which I suspect is what the Cheese Cake Factory has cooking the food, back in the kitchen. Seriously, no ""chef"" worth his/her salt would ever let a piece of freshly grilled salmon come to a customer that dried out and tough All it takes is for me to be lied too. Then it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth for all their yummy desserts. Epic fail Cheese Cake Factory! I will certainly NOT be a returning customer.

Served with honey mustard dipping sauce.   I was surprised and aggravated when the bill for LUNCH was $50.  One lunch special, two appetizers, an ice tea, and tonic and lime was $50.  WOW!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=780

I asked the waitress if I could get a new slice of cheesecake on a new dish. At first, she only returned with a new dish of whipped cream, I asked if I could get, yet again , a new slice of cheesecake given that the original slice had the nestled up against the soiled dish in the first place. As if my order was so complicated, she finally took the original slice of cheesecake back, only to return with that same slice of cheesecake but now on a different plate. Frustrated, I told the waitress that this was the same slice of cheesecake she told me no it was not. Unbenounced to her I had created a dent in the same slice of cheesecake with my fork to see if they would actually give me the same slice of cheesecake prior. Nonetheless I sent it all back .

Yes, the food is pricy, but good lord man, look how much you're getting!!! Tragically, I didn't have room to try any cheesecake, and taking a piece with me didn't sound appealing at the time.

Why are the portions so medieval? Why does most of it taste so good? I broke down and ordered the salmon, because quite frankly they didn't have anything very appealing as far as vegetarian options go, and I haven't really been against incorporating some fish slowly back into my diet. I will probably go another 6 months before eating meat again though. ANYWHO... We ordered the avocado egg rolls --- I HIGHLY recommend these. They are warm and flavorful (kind of guacamole-ish? but not? just tasty so order them) and there is a really nice cilantro cashew (?) dipping sauce that comes with it. At least that's what the waitress was mumbling. Honestly I was full after that and the bread. We felt bad though and ordered entrees anyway.  I ordered the barbecue salmon off the ""Special Menu"" for 14.95 and it was pretty impressive. You get a lot of food for the price and it really doesn't seem like a rip off. The salmon was grilled with a basic barbecue sauce on it, and it came with a corn, red pepper, and zucchini salad underneath, with smashed red potatoes which were VERY tasty. The salmon was topped with some thinly sliced onion rings. Those were kind of bland, so I was dipping them in the sauce that came with the egg rolls.  My date ordered the fish tacos, there were three of them which were HUGE and had cabbage, cilantro, onions, lime and sauce spilling off the top. It came with standard Spanish rice, black beans, guacamole and pico de gallo.  I ate painful forkful by painful forkful, and barely got through a quarter of it before deciding to box it up. My date started to go into a food coma at the table, and his eyes were like half-open and one was starting to go to the side, so I decided we should probably leave and go take a nap.

Miles C.,"Sacramento, United States",125,114,24,3.0,15/11/2010,"The food here is very tasty and the variety is stellar.  In fact the variety here is a bit of a negative for me.  The nearly dozen pages of menu is densely packed with short descriptions and a myriad of choices that make it hard to remember what on page 3 piqued your interest when you are on page 9. They have a pretty serious bar menu which is full of seriously overpriced booze that I've never ordered.  Might be a great place for drinks, I wouldn't know. The decor is outlandish and absurd but in a way that really makes it feel like something out of Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.  There are a lot of styles and textures and pillars and wow all over.  I find it magical at times and over the top at others (depends on my mood I guess).  What can't be denied is the place has a real sense of identity. It's the only place in town that serves White Chicken Chili which while tasty is nothing at all to do with chili.  It's also the only place in town I've seen goulash on a menu.  It's nto as good as my hungarian grandmother's family recipe but for a place not run by a 74 year old gypsy woman, it's pretty damn good.  I've tried a number of things here and seldom been disappointed (The Carbonara was pretty meh).  That said for the prices they charge it damn well better be good. There isn't a thing on the menu that is less than 7.50 and tracking down a meal less than 12.00 is a chore.  Everything in here is half a price point above a normal chain restaurant like Chili's or Applebee's and while the style here says ""posh"" it can also read ""Full of itself"" and not be wrong on either count. I like the place, my girlfriend loves the place.  I think it's overpriced but I also think it has the best variety in town.  If the servers were consistently awesome (they are generally hit and miss) and the prices were a little less crazed (7.50 is too much for even tasty cheesecake) I would love the place.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=780

Since our group was large, we had 2 servers.  They were both friendly and attentive.  Prior to ordering, they asked if we would all like separate bills, which is a plus.  They kept all of our waters filled throughout the night and did a good job remembering who ordered what even though a few of us changed our seats.  Large groups can get annoying, especially when they start moving around or getting out of their seats (which we did) but the servers kept a smile on their face and made us feel very comfortable and welcome.

C C.,"Roseville, United States",1,19,2,4.0,27/11/2012,"Went here the day before Thanksgiving with 3 other office mates for a birthday lunch. Now when office workers come for lunch, time is *always* important. With this in mind, here's my review: We were seated right away and Paul introduced himself as our server. For starters, each one of us ordered something different to drink - 3 diff Iced Teas (Plain, Tropical and Green), we each ordered a diff Tea and one diet soda...Paul brought the bread and all but the Green Tea. We were all over the warm dark bread as we were sooo hungry! But after at least 5 minutes, my Green Iced Tea still hadn't arrived and after chowin' the bread - I was thirsty! ;-( FWIW: We didn't receive auto-water, but I'm OK with that -any time-, b'cuz I understand and am a big fan of not wasting water, so if we don't ask for it, we don't need it... period. As a matter of fact, I will look at water being served automatically as a negative.  Paul returns to take our orders, and we ask about my tea, ""Oh, we have to get that from the Bar and I'll have to check on it"". Oh?! You should have checked on it BEFORE you returned to take our order...  Grrrrr....  He leaves and returns with my tea... Paul then takes our orders, suggesting a couple of things, based on inquiries from my friends, and his suggestions were spot-on to what my friends were interested in, which was the Grilled Eggplant sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries.  Feeling for spicy, I ordered the Cajun Burger and my other friend ordered the Factory Burger. BTW, I *rarely* order burgers, but the Cajun seemed to fit my crave for spicy this day...  Paul asked how I'd like it cooked (med-rare, thank you) and got the green salad side with Bleu Cheese dressing. He sped off, neglecting to ask the other Burger order how he'd like it cooked. We discuss how long it will take for Paul to return with that question - another 7 minutes and he finally returns to ask! Remember? We were on limited time...! Grrrrr... Our food arrived, except for mine -again-  :-(   All looked fab, and the Factory burger was cooked to order nicely -well done-, so why didn't my Cajun burger make it to the table? It takes less time to cook a burger to med-rare than well-done, right? No explaination from our server. I munched on my friends' Sweet Potato Fries while I waited....   My Cajun Burger arrived and it looked fab (sorry, was so hungry, forgot to take pics); cooked to perfection and tasted great, BUT, it was not in the least bit spicy. After I chowed 2/3rds of it, I realized the Andouille sausage was missing! Dammit! Too late to complain, so I sucked the rest of it down. But am here to comment and wonder how such a fab place (I *love* their decor and ambience, and their food offerings are quite good) can screw up so big?!   So that's my latest experience, 4 stars, they need to figure out the Iced Green Tea offer and remember the Andouille sausage, dammit... !",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=700

Erica S.,"Manhattan, United States",0,68,35,3.0,9/8/2014,"Went here because we got in late to our hotel and it was open very late (12:30). Very loud and dark, as per usual with this place. Maybe would've been better if there hadn't been two very large and noisy birthday groups screaming by the bar the whole time. We were seated far away in the corner but could still hear them. So dark I had to use my cell phone flashlight to read the menu. Had the Caesar Salad and Shrimp Scampi. The portions here are enormous. My Caesar was the smallest size and could've fed three people. Shrimp Scampi was delicious, 6 very generously sized lightly breaded shrimp in a yummy cream sauce. The best part of the entire meal is the bread (is it pumpernickel?).

Oh I just miss the days where I could just pick it something out and not care. Thank you California legislation... Any ways The food is good, the Cheese cake is awesome. Minus 1 star for being a bit pricey (8 bucks for a slice I could sell my kidney and maybe get 3), and minus 1 star for having the calories right on the food, it takes the fun out of eating.

Miika M.,"San Francisco, United States",2238,1693,2109,3.0,7/12/2006,"I had just started off a relaxing evening when I was rifling through my mail and found a letter from my ex, who said, quote: ""You have set the bar too high for anyone.  Give me a call."" Ya, right, loser.  So, since my evening was already somewhat ruined by being contacted in that way, I agreed to meet up with my good friend Melody, who was in the mood for some cheesecake.  We decided to drive to the Arden Mall to hit the Cheesecake Factory. My first experience at this chain, was actually when it first opened in San Francisco.  I was conducting a shopping tour with a bunch of friends from Japan and since we had just finished a rigorous utilization of credit cards at Macy's, staying in the same building seemed like a great idea.  What I remembered, was the whimsical interior design and the mega large portions of food. So, a quick zip back to now, we walked in around 8:30 and find out it will be about a 15 minute wait.  The lobby was packed with people, mostly young.  I felt a stab of remorse.  What was I doing in here, when I should be at home, getting ready to sleep and rejuvenate myself for work the next day  ;o) We were seated in about the time stated in the alcove to the left of the kitchen.  This gave me a moment to adjust my peripherals and vision to the dim lit setting inside.  Let me put it this way, if you are here on a date, you will look good.  There is no lighting on the tables, so wrinkles and other non-efficiencies will not be on display.  The dimmed lighting even made me feel good, not too fond of my freckles and war scars.  In addition to the lighting, the dark wood tables and booths contrast greatly with the whirled beige/rose walls and up into the mosaic of swirls and plush rounds of art displayed on the ceiling.  It made me feel as if I were sitting in a pseudo touchy feely version of an Americanized Casbah.   Our server was Donald (who was all smiles and cute with his successful communicative abilities) and after a quick perusal of the menu, decided that my large butt did not deserve anything other than the large Market Salad, conglomeration of mixed greens, radicchio, endive, fresh sweet beets, pieces of avocado and Kalamata olives tossed in their house vinaigrette ($8.95) and a signature pizza, the Pesto Chicken with a dash of fresh garlic ordered as an extra topping (I think it was around $10).  They have a large menu here, so be prepared to take your time, or at least have an inkling of what you and your stomach are predisposed to.  In addition to standard American fare {Meatloaf entree, hamburgers, sandwiches, and pastas, are their takes/attempts at Asian fusion choices, which are evident in their appetizers (Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, Thai Lettuce Wraps) and more.  They even make omelets, for gawd's sake}  Add in another two pages stock filled with every sort of cheesecake imaginable, and your evening is set. I was impressed with my salad.  Huge.  Large.  And the beets were dumped like bombs, red ones, staring at me with an ominous presence.  Everything was fresh, crunchy, and the right texture.  Our pizza was pretty good.  In fact, better than California Pizza Kitchen.  Lots of creamy cheese that strung off my slice as it traveled the perilous journey from the serving plate to my dinner plate.  Pieces of tender marinated chicken, red roasted peppers, and the pesto base was exquisite.  I can't believe I'm saying this about their pizza, it was not expected.  The crust was thin, but not too thin, as the edge had bubbled up perfectly to ensconce the thick topping and slightly sweet.   All the while, Donald was quite attentive, stopping by several times to make sure everything was satisfactory.  At one point, since I was busy pulling the stereotypical Japanese move and fiddling with my new Sureshot camera, we spent several moments talking about picture depth and macro mode.   After we finished, we had only consumed two slices of pizza from a round of 6, which Melody took home.  Our bill, with the two Market Salads, the pizza, two ice teas and her cheesecake, came out to around $43.  Not too bad, considering she used a gift certificate, which brought our total down to $12-15 each. Good reception, good service, and good food.  After rethinking my cruel and unforgiving opinion of chains, I would come back here again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=840

I only got five thin pieces of asparagus - I was a little peeved about that, but at least it was cooked well. Oh and the lord forsaken lemon sauce, I could of done without that.

Can I not tell time or something? Because I had 3 other people agree that we waited quite awhile to get seated. Ugh seriously I don't care just stop BSing people, and I really don't give a rat's ass if your busy! The host had to call over that guy because apparently he had all the power for seating blah blah!  Anyways the food was OKAY. Could have been better. I did like that the server acknowledged there was a birthday recipient at the table and brought over a dessert and some singing companions ... but that was half -assed which was obvious because i couldn't hear them when they were right in front of me and they didn't look like they even wanted to do. Separate the business from the personal people, thats part of the job description!  I'm not there to humiliate them and I don't care if you did a billion happy birthdays during the shift but if you want to execute excellent customer service you should be above being a half-ass and get it right.

Anthony I.,"Sacramento, United States",13,8,6,2.0,20/8/2012,"I visited this restaurant on April 30, 2012. This was a Monday. I had called two days prior and asked the receptionist what their slowest day of the week was, so as to avoid the endless stream of Cheesecake Factory patrons. Monday was their slowest day of the week according to the woman on the phone. Monday was my birthday so this worked out perfectly. I show up with a party of four (me included) Monday around 5 pm. I mentioned to the hostess that we would be having four additional guests showing up for dessert only. She was kind enough to give me several seating options. I chose to sit at the tables closest to the bar. Our waitress was decent. She got us started off with the drinks. I ordered the caramel pretzel vodka milkshake. (Had I known that one drink was $10 I would have never ordered it. ALL prices should be listed on Cheesecake Factory's menu, not just some of them!) Sadly the drink was not up to par with its premium pricing. There was more than a pregnant pause between ordering our drinks and ordering our food. I was a little annoyed that ordering took so long, especially because the restaurant seemed very empty. Our orders were placed. Again I felt there was an extraordinarily long wait for our food. We were a party of four, and the restaurant was uncharacteristic of the seemingly always busy Cheesecake Factory I have seen in the past. I do not remember the exact placement of events, but somewhere between ordering our food and getting our food, our initial waitress had left for a lunch break. This is where I felt my visit went downhill. I do not recall the fill-in waitress ever checking on us, nor being present when our food arrived. The food itself was good. Always is. Again I do not remember the exact order of events that took place, but the additional four guests arrived and our original waitress returned from her lunch break. Desert was ordered. Desert was probably the most time consuming part of our visit. It took FOREVER to receive our damn cheesecake! Ironically our waitress seemed annoyed with us, like we had done something wrong! Nothing verbal, just silent body language cues. Desert is finished, and the late four arrivals of our party leave. It is now 8 pm, and I swear 2 of the 3 hours we spent in the factory were dedicated to waiting. We received the check... The waitress charged us an automatic gratuity of 18% for our ""large party."" This angered me beyond belief. Our total bill was about $170. That means about $30 was dedicated to her tip alone. I felt this mandatory tip was well in excess of the service rendered. Aside from a lacking in service I didn't feel that I needed to pay more for four people who only received dessert. When questioned about this mandatory tip, our server gave us a very obvious attitude, and told us it was ""Factory Policy."" I work in retail customer service and I know good service when I see it.

They have italian, chinese, mexican, american, and maybe others too. i often find that at these restaurants the food tends to be mediocre at best. I ordered the fish tacos, with mahi mahi, and my lady ordered the tostada chicken salad. I was absolutely blown away by their fish tacos. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the combination of the cabbage and sauce and lime juice made them melt in your mouth. My lady's salad was a bit overdressed, but at the same time it was well put together, the chicken was marinaded or rubbed with some kind of spices and was absolutely delicious.' The ONLY reason i am giving this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 was because of our waiter.

However, we waited a good 10 minutes for the waiter to take our order.  We did not get our food until about 15 minutes later.   Since it's my wife's birthday, I asked the waiter if they have anything free as a birthday gift.  However, there is no such thing at the Cheesecake Factory.

Merisa M.,"Sacramento, United States",296,140,56,4.0,12/1/2012,"I don't know what it is, but Cheesecake Factory is always my choice for date night!  Either it's the slightly classy ambience or the dimmed mood lighting, but something about it always keeps this place as one of my top eateries in Sacramento. During lunch time, I usually get the pasta lunch special where you can order a lunch sized portion of their select pasta dishes.  It's cheaper than dinner prices and I've never been able to finish a whole one by myself.  The cream sauce for their pasta dishes is simply divine, so whenver I go, I ALWAYS order the Fettucine Alfredo or the Pasta Carbonara.  What's really awesome about it is that I can change the type of pasta used int he dish.  The Pasta Carbonara is supposed to come with Spaghettini, but I prefer Penne pasta.  They change it, no problem, and there isn't any extra charge!  When I go for dinner, I usually order the same thing as lunch.  What can I say, I'm a creature of habit. The only difference, I've just started ordering cheesecake for dessert.  My preference, the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  Oh.  Em. Gee!!!  AMAZING!! It's sweet, chocolatey goodness in my mouth! Granted, it is quite rich and I can never eat the whole thing in one sitting, so I always take it home and eat it for breakfast the next day!

Lyddiebug M.,"Sacramento, United States",1,8,4,2.0,2/5/2014,"Food was great service was horrible. To start, when we got here we were told the wait would be 20 min, and we waited 46 min before being seated. After being seated, we didn't get greeted by a server for about 10 minutes. Our server was very inattentive, our waters were never refilled and she didn't check on us throughout our experience. She also placed our to go orders with our regular orders which caused it to come out before our food even came out. We spoke with a manager who was very friendly (thank you!) and took care of us after apologizing for the service.  Our servers name was Dymitria, who apparently has a good reputation in the restaurant, so maybe she was just having a bad day.

The waiters are very friendly, the bathrooms are always clean, and although the seating can be a little bit tight, I always leave satisfied with the service. The decor is amaaaaaazing.

Michelle B.,"Oroville, United States",0,16,2,3.0,28/7/2011,"My girlfriend and I came here on a Monday at around 8:30 PM and were immediately greeted by the hostess. She was very very sweet. She asked us for our names and then our preference of a booth or a table. We then were seated right away.  We were greeted by our server within three to five minutes. He seemed nice, but slightly casual and for the most part, was inattentive. He took our drink and food order, checked on us once during our main course, and then presented us with the check--all of the actual food delivery and other checkbacks were performed by other servers. Also, at one point, he spoke loudly about how much money he had made with another co-worker (a little bit unprofessional). As far as the food, it was above average. Not extraordinary, but definitely good. The Artichoke, Crab and Cheese Dip was a great small plate for sharing and tasted great--with big chunks of roasted artichoke. My girlfriend's main course, the Baja Chicken Tacos, was really really good! If you like Mexican food, this dish actually tastes pretty authentic! My main course, the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean, was good; but I was disappointed in the portion size. The amount of garnish on my plate compared to actual edible fish was maybe 3:1. But, what was there, tasted good. NOTE: I noticed this location was rather small compared to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants I've been to. My advice would be to visit on a weeknight after 8:00 PM. I can imagine a one to two hour wait being in place on a Friday or Saturday night during dinner hour.

Rexelle S.,"Stockton, United States",49,29,,4.0,3/12/2011,"No reservations. Came here at night and it was packed! (Front Desk) Service was horrible. They gave us a pager, when it turned off, we went in. The hostess told us to stand on the side and wait to be assisted. 3 other people behind us got called while we were still waiting. We asked again when will we be called and the hostess gave this BS lie saying ""Oh someone did call you but because it's so loud I guess there was a miscommunication. Sorry about that, It'll be another 15 mins."" Mind you, we already waited 30 mins. with our pager. Anyway, we finally were called a little less than 15 mins. and were seated at a booth. (If you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory, they have a REALLY dim atmosphere. So if you're not into the eating in the dark business, you shouldn't visit any Cheesecake Factories) The food *and cocktails; however, are really good. I'm no regular, but I've made a good amount of visits to be able to rate the quality and quantity of their meals and drinks. **For appetizers, I recommend either the lettuce wrap or the avocado rolls **For a meal, I don't have any specific recommendations just because it depends on your taste, although, those that I've tried (and may not completely remember the names) have been delicious. I do remember having some kind of pasta and some type of sandwich and burger. **For cocktail, my favorite is Georgia Peach! It's a refreshing and fun ""special"" smoothie ;) **For dessert, Cheesecake is obviously the way to go. I personally like the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake and the tuxedo cheesecake. Oh! and I LOVE the bread and butter they serve as you order and wait! One time I went with my cousins for some drinks. They ordered a quick appetizer to snack on while I enjoyed the *free*, warm bread and butter :) ... If you want to finish your meal without having to take the rest to go, you shouldn't have the bread just because it's addicting and really fulfilling...well, unless you have a strong and hungry stomach, go for it) The price range is okay (~$10-20 ish) but worth the meal.

Kathleen F.,"Beaverton, United States",34,49,,4.0,2/6/2013,"I am never disappointed with the good ole' Cheesecake Factory! I have never had a dish I didn't love to pieces. My Favorites are the Mac 'n' Cheese Burger and the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Off all the chain restaurants, they have the best waitresses (Who actually know the menu) and alcoholic beverages(I would rather come here and pay $12 for a fantastic Pina Colada than crappy Apple Bees). Desserts are of epic proportions, I have had their cheesecake(original and dulce de leche) and the Godiva Chocolate Brownie(Wonderful!). The Cons: Price and Waiting time I think anytime you go to the Cheesecake factory on the weekends or special holiday, you are going to have to wait.........there is no way of getting around it, its how the cookie crumbles. I have never had their brunch but I wouldn't even attempt to go wait for it(the wait is pretty long on sunday mornings). Its no better at the Roseville locations either, so dont even attempt to drive the extra 15 minutes to think it will be ""faster""....because it won't. The price is pretty outrageous, for 3 adults to eat, this includes :one appetizer, 3 entrees, 3 standard beverages, 3 desserts and tip will run about $110. Add in alcoholic beverages, you are looking close to $140! BUT, If you are anything like me and only eat out a couple times a year, you want quality food that is going to satisfy you and this place hits the spot. I have never left here feeling like I threw away money like at other major chain restaurants, because of the quality your are getting....nothing beats it. If you have never been here you are missing out....get yourself over and try their cheesecake....IT FLIPPING AWESOME!!!

Tiles on the ceiling, Roman columns, Tuscan murals and Egyptian decor? What is this, an adult restaurant version of 'It's a Small World'?) But I was in the mood for a steak and this seemed to be the only reasonably-priced local restaurant open on a late Sunday night. We sat outside on the heated patio, which was delightfully quiet and uncrowded compared to inside. Man, that venue is always packed like they're giving away... well, cheesecake. The staff was attentive and friendly. The service was prompt. My friend got the Mushroom Burger and I got the Steak Diane. We enjoyed the food, everything tasted fine, and my white sangria cocktail was really good. We left with what seemed to be a good experience. Aaaand then 2 hours later we both got food poisoning.

They have their niche. They are somewhere in a range above Olive Garden and below your local fine dining. They are not TGIF but they also are not that 5-star 2 month wait on reservations establishment.  Yes the menu can be overwhelming. Goodness gracious it's a novel. But they do capture something for everyone...from appetizers to entrees to delectable desserts and of course the best cheesecakes in the Western Hemisphere. The place can be cheesy (no pun intended), but it is a place where all walks of life can meet at neutral ground. While meeting at neutral they can enjoy great food, great drinks and yes again the best cheesecakes around.  The miso salmon, wasabi tuna, and the jambalaya pasta are killer. I try to stay away from this trifecta of deliciousness but I just can't. For the cheesecakes, just try them all. My favorite is the Dutch Apple and the pineapple upside down.

Aron E.,"Tracy, United States",25,9,1,5.0,1/1/2015,"If you're looking for the most interesting (and delicious!) variety of cheesecakes in the valley, come here. If you want to try a host of great food before you skip to dessert, come here. If you're looking for neither, still come here. You will become a believer. As soon as you walk in the door, you'll notice the tidy and inviting atmosphere, as well as the fresh display of almost every cheesecake they have to your left. Once you see those, you know you're coming back. Maybe not tomorrow or next week, as you'll need to recuperate, but face it: you're coming back. The restaurant always looks great. Its colors are relaxing and eye-pleasing, the buidling itself is spacious, and has outdoor and bar seating. The bathroom usually doesn't reek of urine, which is one of the highest forms of compliment I can give to a public restroom. When you sit down to order, they will offer you sweet wheat bread, and either white or sourdough along with butter. And no, you don't get to choose between white and sourdough; I was just too busy stuffing my face with wheat to recall which one it was! The food gets better every time I order. My favorite item on the menu by far is Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp for three words: sweet, spicy Thai. I had to stop myself from ordering it the last few visits so that I could experience a spot of the rest of the huge menu. This is a real item, I kid you not: a burger with topped with fried macaroni and cheese, smothered in more cheese. Need I say that I was scarfing it down during a conversation with abandon? Fish and chips come with huge portions of fish, fries (substitutable for sweet potato), and cole slaw. Everything is huge. For health buffs, you may want the alternate menu, as hardly anything runs under quadruple digits for calories. The cheesecake is served in either large, thick slices for around 7.50 or one of two full cake sizes for special occasions (the larger ones go for 50). Allow me to list off the ones you'll probably want: the large, multi-layered Ultimate Red Velvet, the caramel-covered White Chocolate Macadamia with its sweet cookie-tasting crust, the seasonal flavors, Peppermint and Pumpkin, and the legions of chocolate-based flavors, including Snickers, Reese's, Godiva, mousse, and 30th anniversary cake. That is hardly a third of them. I plan to try them all in years to come. They also have traditional desserts on their menu, which is cute. I may try them someday. The only slight I have against this restaurant is this one server who was visibly and audibly anxious about me ordering several slices of cheesecake to go. It was very rude.

Carol P.,"Sacramento, United States",3077,824,879,5.0,27/8/2013,"The stars were aligned just right for a fabulous late (11:30pm) Saturday night dinner.  It wasn't crowded at all so we were seated right away.  Our lovely server Ashley had perfect timing whenever she came to our booth to take our order, bring us food, check on us, refill drinks, etc.  Our food came out hot and in record time.   We started off with the calamari ($11), delicately battered and fried crispy, just a tad oily but still had a nice texture without being too chewy.  Cocktail sauce and aioli that accompanied it were good but boring.  Nonetheless, we killed that appetizer!  I decided on the herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi combo ($20), which comes with mashed potatoes and a few asparagus spears.  Yelpers, I've found my new favorite entree!  The scampi was to die for.  The 3 large shrimps were lightly fried and rested on the most amazingly seasoned garlic and butter sauce, that wasn't too rich but bursting with tons of flavor in every bite.  The mashed red potatoes were thick and creamy and  soaked up the scampi sauce well.  The salmon was topped nicely with an array of fresh chopped herbs and was a good-sized portion.  It was just slightly cooked a little longer than I prefer, but still flaked off nicely and had excellent flavor.  Omega-3 fatty acids at its best!  My bf had the grilled rib eye steak with fries ($25).  It came out with perfect grill marks, and sliced like butter.  It was juicy, tender, and had great flavor.  He found his favorite entree too, and although he thought the size was a little bit small for the price, the flavor made it worth every penny.   The entire meal and dining experience has redeemed The Cheesecake Factory from our previous lackluster visits, and put it back on top as my ""favorite chain restaurant.""",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=420

Lily D.,"Roseville, United States",78,451,1213,3.0,30/1/2015,"I have not been to a cheesecake factory since 2009 because my last few experiences did not wow me enough to come back.  Decided to try again as I was in the area on business. We walked in around noon on a thursday.  Place was busy but not packed.  I put my name in, walked away for a Minute, and came back to ask how long the wait would be.  She asked me, ""how many in your party?"" Um, i was just here literally a minute ago and you could not remember you already took my name down? I asked how long and she says, ""not long, we'll call you.""  Not digging the lack of info as I was on a schedule.  Anyways, we were seated within 5 mins along the row where its one long bench seats and one wicker chair across the table so you are seated quited close to people next to you.  Waitress came within a 7 mins to take our order.  We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and it was much smaller than expected for $6.99 but good.  The ""helper"" that delivered it first tried giving our artichoke to the table next to us until we got his attention it was ours.   We waited 30 mins for our food to arrive and never saw our waitress during that time.  My friend got the turkey sandwich and salad and I got the lunch portion crusted parmesan chicken.  Both were delicious. However, we again hardly saw our waitress and we had to get going as our lunch hour had passed so we put our credit card out for her to slide to save us time when we finally got the bill.  I looked at the bill and she charged us for drinks when we only had waters which turned out to be the table next us drink order.  Again waited another 10 mins before she ever came back.  Pointed this out and she was gone again for quite some time.  Then had to ask if she voided the original transaction.  She asks, ""did i slide your card?""  so she disapeared AGAIN to fix it.  UGH.  This whole ordeal had us there for 90 mins which should have been only an hour.  I wanted to get dessert but ran out of time.  I give the food a 5 but the service is a 1 so they get an average of 3.

I called to set up a reservation for 12 people and was told to come in 15 minutes before the time we wanted to eat (which was 6) to put our name in. I thought only 15 minutes was a stretch for 12 people so I went in a full hour early. When I went in at 5, they then told me it would be two hours before we could be seated. I called everyone else in my party and told them to come at 630. By 6 I went to check on our progress and was told we would be seated by 615, a time when none of our party would be there. I called everyone again and told them to hurry. We didn't get seated until 8 o'clock!!!!!! I was there for three hours, they changed their story multiple times, our party ended up being split into 3 groups so we could eat. It was also a group of mainly elderly relatives that all wanted to go out and have dinner together because we had been to my grandpas funeral earlier that day. Two were in wheel chairs which was my reason for getting there early to make sure they didn't have to sit around and exhaust themselves waiting. I am so disappointed and disgusting with this restaurant. I will never eat here again. They have us a free appetizer which was ridiculous compared to the BS we had to deal with. Plus they messed up our food orders. It would have been nice if they were honest with me in the first place when I called and told me this would be difficult for them to accommodate and not until much later in the evening at that.

Gary B.,"Galt, United States",18,28,1,4.0,13/1/2011,"I'll start off by saying that you're wasting a trip if you don't get the blueberry and white chocolate cheesecake :) Some of the best dessert I've had. Overall, it was quite nice. The lighting was dim and the ambient noise was peaceful. I went with the petite fillet mignon which was about 8oz, yet I was still wanting more when I was done. I found it odd that most of the steaks came with french fries so I substituted mashed potatoes. They gave me a mountain of potatoes, which tasted pretty good, but I would have liked a 3rd course such as a vegetable without having to pay an extra $4 for a plate of broccoli (thus the 4 stars instead of 5). The steak was cooked perfectly, and extremely tender. The flavor wasn't all there though. I found myself dipping the meat in my girlfriend's Hibachi steak sauce to liven it up a bit. So if you're wanting steak, I'd probably recommend the Hibachi over the Fillet.  We also had the avacado egg rolls which were absolutely delicious. Someone wanted guacamole also, and that was pretty good too. We rounded it off with a nice bottle of white wine for an overall pleasant meal.

I can take or leave the cheesecakes (I'm not big on desserts) but there are several items in the menu that are consistently good throughout different branches in different cities.  When it comes to chain restaurants, even the good ones, I tend to stick with a couple of favorite dishes because I know I will enjoy them. The luau salad is a delicious salad layered with crispy tortilla-like crackers. It's really refreshing and filling (it has chicken, mandarin orange slices, and I can't really remember what else). I also really love the classic burger. The first time I had it, it was cooked SO perfectly -- medium well and juicy! It was a long wait for the burger but well worth the wait!  Another dish that's really good is a pasta dish with penne, eggplant, sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, and tossed in olive oil (I can't really remember the name but I think ""Denise"" is in it).  Service is always really good there too, so that's always a plus. There's ALWAYS a wait though, that's probably the only annoying thing about it.

But I'll drive out to Roseville where the service is (sometimes) better if my cravings ever get to me again. I went here when it first opened in Sacramento, and it was terrible. Food, service, wait time, noise, etc. Had the plain cheesecake and it was the worst cheesecake I ever had. My husband concurred. Worst, ever. And we LOVE cheesecake.  Second time we were seated on the patio and the wait staff pretty much forgot about us. My husband knew he had to be to bed early that night, but considering we got there for a normal dinner time, we thought he'd have plenty of time for dinner. He had to leave before the food even arrived. We were there for so many hours waiting, I lost track. After that, I swore the place off. But then I was treated to the Roseville location and had the best experience ever. So husband and I decided to splurge on a nice dinner for our 6 month wedding anniversary at the Arden location thinking maybe since it wasn't so new, they had worked out the kinks. We were being too optimistic.  Waited forever. Were seated at the smallest table, just inches from the people next to us, on either side. Heard every word of their conversation, but could barely hear each other to carry on a conversation of our own. Our table was behind the bar where they had TVs playing sports games with the volume ON. It was astonishingly loud in the place. Service was horrible. I ordered the same burrito I loved at the Roseville location, but it wasn't as packed with all the delicious stuff this time. Still good, but they skimped on the ingredients. Our two dishes barely fit on our tiny table. Waiter rarely checked on us and had a cold demeanor.  But what took the cake was my husband's ""rack"" of ribs, which didn't come as a rack. They were individual ribs (who does that??) and had virtually no meat on them. What was there was fat. But they were so bare to the bone they almost looked as if someone had already eaten them.

We were seated quickly but it took the waitress almost 10 minutes to come say hi I'll get you some water then walk away before we could order any other drinks or even our food since we were ready to order. When she came back she said she could take our order. I ordered a salad and my boyfriend ordered an old fashioned burger. When our food finally came, she brought my boyfriend what looked like some type of sandwich on sourdough bread, and brought me an extremely small appetizer size salad (I actually think it was from their small plates menu which is even smaller than an appetizer) and then promptly ran off before I could spit the words from my mouth that the order was wrong. When she came back 5 minutes later we pointed out that my boyfriend had gotten the wrong burger and I had gotten the wrong size salad. She mumbled something about the burger saying that's what he ordered and then took my salad away. He decided to just eat what he was given and they brought my salad back another 10 minutes later. My lettuce was still frozen! Maybe it was just in the back of the crisper but I always order salads at Cheesecake Factory and have never had this problem. We tried to finish up and get the waitress' attention but it seemed like she was fed up with us already for some reason. The manager finally came by and asked if our issues were resolved and we explained that she never bothered to get my boyfriend the correct order. He said she indeed brought him the factory burger instead of the old fashioned burger. He offered us a free piece of cheesecake and we accepted.

The restaurant hadn't filled up with a dinner rush yet and my friend and I decided to sit at the bar for drinks and happy hour food. Don was our bartender and I'm so happy he was. He made sure to ask us exactly how we wanted our martinis prepared, which I appreciated. There aren't a whole lot of ways to mess up a martini but there are many ways to make one better by personalization. And he did. My friend and I shared the white bean hummus and a chopped salad. Both amazing! And it wasn't a problem when we asked for share plates, more bread, or fresh ground pepper. The prices weren't cheap but the portions were hefty and everything was very very tasty. Don was on his game. Also a pleasant guy to chat with. It's uncomfortable when bartenders never speak a word to you - We know you can hear our entire conversation so please don't pretend otherwise. Conversely I dislike when bartenders talk too much - as nice as we're all being to each other, you aren't the person I came to have a drink with. Don had the right balance of friendly attentiveness. He also seemed experienced and to genuinely like his job. Whether that's actually the case doesn't make a difference.

I've been to Cheesecake Factory stores up and down California, and had a consistently pleasant experience, but it wasn't 5-star until I discovered and tried this incredible dish. ""Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad."" ... and it tastes even better than it sounds, if you can believe that. Along my journey of discovery, I don't think I had anything I didn't like. A few standouts: - Fried Macaroni and Cheese - You can't go wrong frying mac n' cheese - Four Cheese Pasta - In case the name doesn't sink in, avoid if you don't like cheese; otherwise it's awesome - Monte Cristo - Delicious, but super rich, so plan on sharing, or taking half or more home However, I've certainly had several dishes that I wouldn't order again. Here's the quick list: - Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" - Chicken fingers on par with what'd you'd get at the fair - Orange Chicken - Stick with Panda Express or Trader Joe's for your Orange Chicken - Bang - Bang Chicken and Shrimp - This one is my fault, as I'm not wild about coconut, and this dish was bathed in the stuff And then of course, there's the cheesecake. Good gracious... I've had so many different ones, and they're all so good, none of them really stand out. When it's time to order dessert, just close your eyes and point, you won't be disappointed. Portions are crazy, so come hungry, or ready to share, or clear some room in your fridge for leftovers. I usually enjoy the second half of my dish the next day for lunch,.along with some of the fantastic molasses bread. Sure, it's crowded, and that critique has applied to all 8+ locations I've been to, so just plan for a wait time or go during off-peak hours. At this location at Arden, we've gotten here by 5:30 on a Friday and only waited a couple minutes. Oh, and I've never had a bad service experience, at least that I remember. Everybody always seems really chipper. Almost eerily so.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=600
Ernest L.,"Sacramento, United States",34,2,1,5.0,30/6/2015,This location has been my go to place whenever im not sure what i feel like eating. Have been going constantly for about 3 years now and can't say I've had a single day where I wasn't satisfy with the food and service.

Mark W.,"Sacramento, United States",5,29,,5.0,29/5/2013,"I just love Cheesecake Factory.  They make so many different types of food, that its hard to believe they can do them well.  But the fact is that I've ordered a bunch of different meals, appetizers, and drinks, and they are always really good. My wife and I have gone there several times over the last few months and the experience has been consistently good.  Here are some of my favorite dishes: Vietnamese Tacos - these are tiny, but tasty.  You could argue its not a very good value, but oh my God, they are so delicious!  The soft taco ""shell"" is like a bao bun, and just a little sweet.  The filling is sweet, tangy, spicy, and delicious. Beef Skinnylicious Soft Tacos - how are these under 800 calories? They are beef soft tacos, topped with avocado salsa.  The shells are corn - not steamed corn or fried corn, but lightly grilled maybe? They are some of the best tacos I've ever had, and I've eaten a lot of tacos. Skinny Tuscan chicken - again, how is this on the skinny menu? The portion was huge; more than I could eat, and it all tasted amazing. Chicken Bellagio - olive oil, pesto, Parmesan chicken, angel hair pasta.  Amazing. Oh, dessert.  Yah, I haven't even tried ether cheesecake in a long time. I know it's awesome but I never have room.  The hardest part about cheesecake is deciding which one to try.   I have never had a bad or even mediocre experience at Cheesecake Factory.  I look forward to going back again and again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=600

Well i will just stop there because I don't know what the hell they put in that because it made me SICK! Not the taste it must have been loaded with sugar or something because I could barely concentrate after drinking it and I have never ever had such a problem before! With that being said I had to get my food to go and It was ehhh and I had also ordered a side of Mac and cheese that was flavorless and the grease actually burned a whole in my container. However the banana cheesecake is delicious! I kinda always thought that this place was sorta gourmet but now I know that it's NOT!

Angelica I.,"Fullerton, United States",0,6,,2.0,29/8/2016,"I'm in town with my boyfriend & we decided to come here for our anniversary. We were seated fairly fast considering it was a Monday night. I had ordered the Pasta Carbonara while my partner had the Chipotle Pasta. My food was very delicious and the only reason I'm even considering giving stars to this location. The Chipotle Pasta was debatable. We thought that maybe putting more Parmesan Cheese would make the taste settle down a little. We both raised our hands when a server had turned and she looked at us and completely walked away. We waited for our original server, Marie and after waiting finally got her attention and requested for cheese. She aggravatedly shredded the cheese toppling over on the table and on my partner. She quickly turned around. My partner & I looked at each other out of awe from how rude she was. On top of all this the knife had a green stain on it.

She ordered a veggie burger and liked it. We shared a slice of Oreo cheesecake and we were very happy. The bill wasn't cheap, but it's nice to eat too much (portions are huge) and then shove some cheesecake down your throat and then walk around Arden Fair Mall.

Despite a busy night, the waiters were all really prompt and courteous!  The food came out quickly and, although our nachos were cold, our waiter quickly replaced it with a fresh batch with melted cheese.  Yum!! We also ordered the calamari and garlic chicken farfalle and added asparagus (definitely recommended).  Their nachos are huuuuge but they're not that great.  Everything else was  . Finally, we ended with the best part: dessert!!  Strawberry shortcake and dulce de leche to die for!  I believe it's a consensus that Cheesecake Factory serves the best dessert of all chain restaurants..it's no wonder we chose it for Valentine's Day!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=600
Sally C.,"San Francisco, United States",619,339,91,4.0,19/12/2011,"A lot of my friends groaned when I chose to celebrate my 21st birthday at the Cheesecake Factory. BUT we had a great time.  Our waitress was really awesome. She made me feel really special and always asked me how I liked my food or drink and served me first before everyone else.  Came here on a Friday night with about 10 or so of my friends- we were seated outside with some nice heat lamps which she turned up for us. The hungry boys also went through about like a million bread baskets. Our faves was the brown rye bread which we just called 'the brown bread'... so we would ask her, 'Can you bring us like 5 baskets of only brown bread please?' Yes, hard to believe we are in college. She was constantly bringing us bread and did so with a smile on her face, which we really appreciated. She also laughed along with our weird conversations, haha. Ordered our food- girls got pastas and fish dishes, most of the guys got jambalaya or burgers. Everyone enjoyed the food. The waitress actually went through each drink with me to make sure I would like the one I chose. I ended up ordering the sour green apple martini. Not bad, but I liked the mango cooler someone else got.  We all had a great time and finished off the night with a bunch of cheesecakes. I must say, the cheesecakes here are sooo overpriced but so deliciously made at the same time.  Food here isn't cheap and we waited over an hour for our table, but the experience was good.

Chris H.,"Sacramento, United States",2,20,4,1.0,8/6/2009,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory on a Sunday with my parents. I had lived in Sacramento and San Francisco both for years yet never been to one so I agreed to go out of curiosity.  We got in and sat down we were greeted with a menu packed full of dentist and plastic surgery advertisements one of which featured a photo who looked like a 1960's version of the Joker from Batman. None of which I found very appealing while I'm trying to look for food. While flipping threw every other page to see what I wanted I spotted the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta""  thinking it sounded good I ordered it.  After sitting there and watching people around us get there food even though there were more of them and they arrived later then us and staring at my empty cup of Coke the food finally arrived. I was greeted with a giant bowl of rice with chicken, 3 pieces of shrimp and what looked like tomato paste.If this was ""Jambalaya"" then I was Tom Brokaw. I have gotten better from those frozen dinner kits you get at the grocery store.  Figuring ""what the hell"" and deciding not to ruin the good time my parents appeared to be having since we don't go out together all that often I left it alone and asked for some Tabasco sauce. After about 15 minutes and asking 2 waiters I finally got Tabasco and was able to choke down the rest of my food.  I will never eat here again, between the loudness, the bad food, the horrible service and the amusement park type atmosphere I was seriously disappointed.  I've had better food and service at Denny's.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=920
Squirrel C.,"Hollywood, United States",281,430,72,4.0,30/10/2008,"BIGGEST PORTIONS EVER! Now before you start telling me how I should have tried out some local food spots in Sactown instead of going to a chain, let me preface...when you're with a co-worker or someone that's not a big foodie or if it's a professional meal, it's hard to suggest the whole in the wall out of the way ""cash only"" places for instance.  So...on this trip to Sacramento, I was with a co-worker and I thought a safe choice was Cheesecake Factory.  We were seated after a three-minute wait, which the hostess originally said would take 15 mins. even though there was only one other group ahead of us.  I think they just say that.   My thoughts landed on the BAJA CHICKEN TACOS, which are Three Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Avocado Cream,Tomato and Cilantro.Served with Black Beans, Rice and Guacamole.  Talk about ginormous portions.  I would have ate one and taken the rest home if I could have.   Maybe it was a result of the one beer and pre-dinner bread that I had before my meal, but I was friggin' stuffed.

Drink refills are a big deal for me (see: my BJ's review), so when we were getting refills when our drinks were barely half empty, that is means for a good review in and of itself.

We decided instead of ordering an entree from the regular menu, we would order a few appetizers.  That was a great decision because we were able to see what appetizers we liked and what we' will  avoid in the future.  The appetizers made a great meal and the fact each dish was a different flavor made the meal memorable.   We ordered the following: 1   ROADSIDE SLIDERS      Bite-sized Burgers on Mini-Buns Served w/ Grilled Onions, Pickles      and Ketchup VERY TASTY - would order again, but  as good as it was, it took a back seat to the other appetizers 2. CHICKEN POT STICKERS-       Oriental Dumplings Pan-Fried in the Classic Tradition. Served with       Soy Dipping Sauce       WONDERFUL FLAVOR - would order again and would consider ordering two of these 3.  VIETNAMESE SHRIMP SUMMER ROLLS -      Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms,     Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp. Served     Chilled and not Fried  THIS IS THE BOMB!!  Very tasty, very fresh and the garlic sauce was light and  flavorful.  Would order two of these next time. 4.  FRIED CALAMARI      Served with Garlic Dip and Cocktail Sauce NOT GREASY, WONDERFULLY LIGHT AND TASTY - would order again. 5.  SPICY AHI TEMPURA ROLLS            Fresh Raw Ahi Tuna Seasoned with Green Onions, Spicy Soy Sauce,       Ginger & Garlic Wrapped in Nori and Flash fried Tempura Style  BLAND FLAVOR- would not order again.  The description sounded great and looked great, however, from the first bite, the first thing you taste is the sauce and nothing else. 6.  CHOPPED SALAD       A Delicious Blend of Chopped Romaine Lettuce, Grilled Chicken,        Tomato, Avocado, Corn, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Apple and our House NICE FLAVOR and complimented the rest of the appetizers.  Would order again.

Luigi D.,"Sacramento, United States",52,24,4,3.0,29/5/2012,"Went to this restaurant with my wife today, as we often do when we go out to Arden Fair Mall.  I discovered that if you order from their ""Skinny Menul"" that is exactly what you get, whatever is delivered to your table is ""skinny"".  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which came on toasted bread.  It came with a salad that was enough for three people.  However, the chicken salad in the sandwich was amazingly skimpy.  I'm not exaggerating.  There was literally a minuscule amount of chicken, just a few flakes and a huge amount of lettuce topped with a slice of tomato.  The bread also fell apart in attempting to eat it.  I also had a bowl of lentil soup that was very good and, of course, the bread they deliver to the table is delicious.  I ordered their ""house Merlot"" which cost 7.95 for half a wine glass.  Good, but it cost two dollars shy of the entrée.  Hmmm.  When I commented to the waitress, who was very pleasant, she explained that the sandwich was ""skimpy"" because they have to match it to the calorie count that is given to the sandwich.  Hmmm, again.  It could have stood a lot more chicken, increased the calorie count slightly decreased the salad amount, thus the dressing on the salad and it would have been fine and getting really close to the assigned calorie count.

If you actually manage to get a table be sure to get some cheesecake and if you can't eat it then, take a slice home. It actually keeps really well in the fridge.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1020

Cons:  The wait is ridiculous.  No reservations taken.  Boo.  The interior of the restaurant is very hard so sound gets amplified and it's difficult to hear the person across your table.  The portions may be TOO huge... an exercise in gluttony.  I always try to exercise some self control and take half of my meal home.  Lighting is a bit too dim - I sometimes have a hard time reading my menu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1020

It was delicious, filled with jumbo shrimp and chicken. I didn't even have to ask for a side of sauce and the waiter made sure to bring me an extra bowl!! The portions are large, so make sure you bring your appetite!!  So since it was dinner, we decided to also have a drink. I ordered the Tropical Martini... I think I have found my new favorite drink at the Cheesecake Factory! It's vodka shaken with passion fruit, mango and pineapple. It was very delicious.  My coworkers ordered Cosmopolitans and Asian Pear Martinis. I had a sip of theirs and it was also good, but I would rather stick with the one I ordered.

Overall, the meal was pricey and not very good.  The restaurant was loud, with uncomfortable seating, and we waited a really long time despite having a group reservation.  I ended up getting sick from my meal there despite my best efforts to eat cleanly.  I do not recommend this place if you need gluten-free food or other dietary modifications.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=940

The lighting is pretty, with colorful lights and decorated walls, but it's so incredibly dark! Maybe this is the point. It's hard to see the person sitting across/next to you, and because of the colorful lighting, somehow, everyone seems better looking in this light. This is a good place to take a blind date because you'll look twice as good in this light :) Oh yeah, and if you're wearing a diamond ring (or something diamond) or wear other jewelry, it shines and sparkle a lot more in this light, so this is also a good place to give your S.O. jewelry because she'll (or he) be like 'Omg he got it at Jared!

I can actually make better at home. The fetticine noodles are a bit odd, because they're green, but the sauce wasn't to die for. It was dry and not creamy.

I felt a bit like a food sociologist going to study how corporate food is delivered. The menu seemed to be a 30 page tome but with all of the left hand pages being ads. While I was trying to ponder their nonsensical menu I was blasted with ads for plastic surgery and credit card application information. In fear that betting all of my tickets on the same horse would net be a disappointing meal I picked 2 small plates. I am glad I did because it ended up one of them I could eat. My mother was in a burger mood. The chilies sounded good on one and the look of disappointment and confusion on her face when it came with a side of pickled jalapenos and not the long pasillas or Anaheim that are familiar to so many of us was a bit startling. It was like a dressed up burger and a cheap ball park hot dog had a love child. I cant say that the stale looking tortilla chips helped. My endive salad was a chopped one.... stems, cores and all. Though heavy on dressing, luckily the stiff body of the chosen lettuces held it up. My ""Pizzaette"" was ordered with mushrooms which the kitchen took to mean not to add more to the mix. I realized this one slice in as my tongue started to tingle, not with delight but with swelling. The waiter promptly took the dish back to confirm of its onion freeness only to be told what I had just learned, Everything is premade and only minimally prepared at the time of serving. It would explain the paltry crust on the pizza. I was too sick for desert (and still later for dinner). Looking over the menu I started to ponder the fridges it would take to hold such a varied menu. It must all just be frozen and sent in then placed on a plate like a beautiful microwave dinner.

Curbside Delivery To Go Being my first time trying this, I thought it was a great concept that they had a ""To Go"" counter, along with curbside delivery.  The friendly staff over the phone said that all I had to do was call them when I was close by, and they'd go out and look for my car.  Well, THAT was bullshit.  When I arrived, I parked in the marked, Curbside Delivery parking spot, the car was running, the AC was running but NO one came out to the car.  With the car still running, I had to make another cellphone call, and still it still took extra minutes for them to come out.  ""David"" finally came out, took my $7.22 cents for my slice, which I mistakenly told him just to round up to $8.00, and STILL took another 5 minutes before he came out with the change and Cheesecake.  Okay, okay, the staff here are at least friendlier than Rick's Dessert Diner.  I'll give them another star.  But yikes, I paid $8.00 to waste a gallon of gas?   Disease-Cake Factory has had my brown seal of disapproval since 2004 (my first time was in Studio City).  Dammit,  fooled twice!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=1040

He offered us soup or salad while we were waiting, but didn't mention it if was complementary or not...so we declined. Once our food finally came, we practically inhaled it because we had been waiting so long. We were reluctant to stay longer, but the reason we had come in the first place was to redeem free cheesecake slices, so we ordered a slice of pineapple upside down cheesecake. Even that took a while to come, considering how the front cheesecake counter has slices on plates ready to go for the waiters. Once that plate was cleared, we waited for our check. And waited. Our waiter was nowhere in sight, not even at his other tables nearby. Finally, I flagged him down and asked for the check. After TWO hours at The Cheesecake Factory, when all we had wanted was a simple late lunch/linner, we were more than ready to leave. The saving grace of this experience was the cheesecake.

In the past I have also tried the Salmon, about twice, and each time have gotten sick off of it which is weird because I'm fine with home cooked Salmon. I used to love the food here and the people but I feel like, slowly, not only has their staff changed but so has the food.  The past few times that I came in the food has tasted a little bland. I feel like coming in here now is a waste of money because I can make the same stuff @ home and have it taste much better.  Not only that, I haven't been very happy with service lately either. The last time I came in here was last year with my older sister and a friend. Our friend had asked the waiter what kind of virgin margarita he would offer and his response was whatever looks good to you, he never once asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks, he would pass by our table or act like he was coming towards it and instantly change directions, he took our friends glass and got her a refill without asking her if she wanted another refill,  when it was my turn to order he looked at me and nodded his head at me to order instead of using words like a normal person, we finally requested for another waiter and ended up getting a Complimentary Dessert out of it.

Even when it's busy, the two of us don't have problems just walking in and sitting at the bar. I think that one time we gad to wait for a table or seats in the bar area for maybe 10 minutes.  My boyfriend always gets the chicken enchiladas and they are delicious. Not the most authentic enchilada, but still good nonetheless.  I usually try to get two of the small plates so I can have a little variety. I really enjoy all of the flatbreads they have there. I think my favorite is probably the pear and blue cheese one. It is a little sweeter than I would have expected but was still very good.  The ahi tartare is amazing. I was surprised at the quality of the ahi in there because this is a chain restaurant. But it did taste very fresh and the avocado and sauce that come with it are perfect.  I had the endive salad, but it wasn't my favorite. The lettuce has a very string flavor, which I wasn't really prepared for. The dressing was just alright. Nothing special.  The arugula salad was pretty good. I really like that instead of dressing they just put olive oil and lemon on the salad. The last time I ordered this though, there was wayyyy too much lemon juice and it was nearly in edible. I'll likely request for light lemon juice next time to avoid this.  The grilled artichokes are delicious. They come with two dips and one if them is a vinaigrette that is surprisingly well matched with the artichoke. I'm definitely getting this every time I go here now.  The crispy crab bites and the crab cakes are both delicious! They are also very rich and I could only eat one. I would only get these if there were a group of people to eat them.  The Carlton salad is pretty good. I really like salads with dried fruit and candied nuts, but since I had this there I've had a number of better salads like this. I would pass on this in favor of something else.   The lemon raspberry cheesecake is the greatest. It's the only cheesecake I ever get here. Amazing! The service here is always consistent. The servers are very nice and attentive. Sitting at the bar, I've noticed that service is a little slower, but I don't mind it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=800
Hong T.,"Elk Grove, United States",55,120,171,3.0,9/3/2013,"Headed here to celebrate my moms birthday with my dad and sister. We chose this place because of their large menu which we figured would satisfy everyone. On a friday night there was a 30 minute wait which is very reasonable....we spent those 30 minutes drooling at the cheesecake display. We were greeted fairly quickly when we were seated and our drinks followed shortly. Since we wanted to enjoy the celebration we decided to order the appetizers first, and our main meal after we finished the appetizers. We started off with the calamari and nachos with chicken. The portion sizes here are huge...the calamari was well seasoned and fried, the nachos had large scoops of sour cream, guacomole, salsa, and covered with melted cheese....very good way to start the meal. For dinner, the table ordered the farfalle chicken pasta, grilled rib eye, bbq ranch chicken salad, and the herb crusted salmon....we did it family style so everyone had a little bit of everything. After all of the food we were just too full for cheesecake, but since it was my moms birthday they did sing to her and brought her a very small scoop of ice cream which was very nice.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=800

Honestly, I get it because everyone wanted to be seated. They sent us a text saying that our table was ready which was pretty convenient. Our server was awesome but our food was not. When we got our food it was cold on the outside, and warm on the inside which meant really only one thing, it had been sitting out for a while. I didn't really feel like making a huge deal about it but I did tell the waiter it was cold. His only response was that he was sorry. I ate only about a quarter of it because I was starving. My garlic noodles were not garlicky and the side chicken breast I ordered was lacking flavor and juice, it reminded me of beef jerky. My girlfriends plate had shrimp in it and well she ate some of hers too but later got the sweats and threw up. This had been the only thing we are all day so I know this was the cause. My sister then told me she has gotten food poisoning from a salad at cheesecake before so great to know after the fact.

And even though there's a parking lot, it's still really difficult to find parking , since the restaurant is usually packed. In addition to the temperature, the restaurant is very dimly lit, and very loud, so you really need to speak up when you're having a conversation. Also, some of the tables are really close to each other, almost to the point that you feel like you're eating as a large group, ugh... The one good thing about The Cheesecake Factory is their pastas. I love their marsala and pasta da vinci. I don't stray too far from those two plates, evens though there is definitely a large selection to choose from. Additionally, their service isn't half-bad, if you don't mind them not checking on you very often. They're friendly and will check on you when it's necessary sort-of-thing, especially when the restaurant's crowded. Basically, I'd give the place two stars if it weren't for the fact that their pastas are excellent and their portions are huge. Oh, and I forgot to mention that their cheesecakes aren't very appetizing either, which is really sad since the place is named after the dessert.

I remember feeling extremely impressed with the service -- i.e. water was always filled, we were checked up on, etc. However, since that first time, we've been here many, many times -- usually for dinner. Service has been a hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get someone super attentive, and other times, we'll get someone who hurriedly drops off the food and runs away. Last week, we arrived about an hour before closing time and found our server to be...well, not up to par. She rarely checked up on us and just slid things onto the corner of the table and left.

Stefanie H.,"Sacramento, United States",111,230,,4.0,23/9/2010,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all.  Sure, you'll end up consuming more calories in one sitting than you should have in an entire week...but at least it's delicious.   If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory and you don't know what to expect, I'll summarize - above average chain food, delicious cheesecakes, a menu that rivals the great Russian literary masterpieces in length, and an unholy number of calories in most dishes.  If you take the basic sit-down chains like Olive Garden or Red Lobster and then bump up the quality a notch or two, you get The Cheesecake Factory.   My only real complaint is that I wish they had much smaller portions of the cheesecakes, or some kind of sampler tray for 2 or 4 people where you can get a whole bunch of tiny portions of different cheesecakes.  It's SO HARD to pick just one, and it gets really expensive to order more than a few, even if you do take them home and save the leftovers for later.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=820
Juliana L.,"Olivehurst, United States",77,84,82,3.0,22/4/2011,"Ok so the reason why I am giving this place a 3 star review is because of inconsistent service staff. There are days where the waiter/waitress is kind and actually seems happy that you are there & there of course are the exact opposite. And I can't even correlate it to a specific time of day. I recently took my father here for his birthday, I was a little worried because we showed up just before 5pm. It took about 30min for us to get seated, we did have a group of 5, but honestly the place was not packed (yet.)  We ended up being sat at a booth in the bar, which I won't complain because of the $5 happy hour appetizers! I don't remember our waitresses name but she was really nice & patient with us. My father & his significant other had never been to the Cheesecake Factory before and it took them a while to wade through the menu. WTF is up with the menu?! I'm sorry but the menu is monstrously huge! I would say almost inappropriately huge. Oh and what's up with the ads? And if you don't have a nice patient waiter/waitress you won't have a good experience. I choose the fried calamari as an appetizer, let me tell you the garlicy sauce they serve with them is TO DIE FOR!! Portions are huge, so it is worth the $. The CHEESECAKE! Again the menu is quite cumbersome even for the cheesecakes. And I do have a beef with not all the cheesecakes being CHEESECAKE. Some seem to be cake with some kind of cheesecake put in the middle then given the name Cheesecake for the restaurants name sake. I love the original cheesecake. The redvelvet cheesecake is so wonderful, but don't take it home if you don't finish it, it's not good next day. I've also had the Dutch Apple cheesecake which was also surprisingly freaking awesome (I was expecting to like it but it went far beyond my expectations.)

The fried mac n cheese, flautas, taquitos are good.  The southern fried chicken sandwiches needs my secret sauce to make them excellent and special.

Brandon W.,"Stockton, United States",238,231,2,3.0,2/5/2010,"Every time I go here, I go expecting a typical American/fusion chain meal, loaded with salt and other crap like Applebee's.  I always end up liking my meal even when I try not to like it.  Even better, considering the kind of restaurant it is and the business it gets, the prices are actually reasonable. This place is pretty busy on weekend nights - expect a wait.  The interior looks clean, but the floor always feels wet to me... it could just be my imagination though.  It's very crowded and walking through the place it felt more like a packed San Francisco joint than a chain restaurant in the valley. I had the spicy chicken sandwich with chipotle sauce.  The sandwich wasn't spicy at all, but the chicken patty they give you was delicious - a very thick cut of white meat that was still juicy and tender.  The bun t was served in was toasted and sweet.  The chipotle sauce was too mild for my taste, but still decent.  My main complaint about the sandwich itself was that they give you shredded iceberg lettuce rather than a more leafy cut.  The fries that came with the meal were cooked perfectly, which a nice crunch but no burnt pieces. Another guest had the pork chop. It comes bone-in, with potatoes and a glaze.  I wasn't a big fan of their glaze, but the pork was cooked perfectly and the potatoes that came with it were delicious. Another guest had the misu salmon, which I did not try but I can say the presentation was interesting - it was served on top of a thick ""disc"" of rice and edamame's surrounding it like a clock. For dessert, we had the dulce de leche cheesecake and the strawberry shortcake.  The cheesecake was very good - creamy from top to bottom with a consistent and potent dulce de leche taste.  The strawberry shortcake was probably the best I've ever had - instead of serving it with a sponge cake, it's served with a sweet biscuit-like bread and with a large amount of ice cream, whipped cream, and strawberries.  Both desserts were excellent and a great way to finish the meal.

For example: Once I was here with my accountant for dinner and we had just finished our dinner and were contemplating dessert when I could see the manager eyeing our table.  I guess our table was the holdout because he needed to make a 15 top and couldn't until we left.  It is not like we spent 2 hours there, it was about 45 minutes from sit down to dinner.  I felt that if the manager could vaporize us with his eyes to make us move, we would be vapoooorized to oblivion.

Every time I've went the waiter/waitress' service was lacking. They need to be better staffed so I'm not waiting 15 minutes for a drink refill.  I'd rather take the cheesecake to go, and for food, eat somewhere else.

We waited 15 minutes to be seated (not bad). The waiter was nice but not overly nice. I believe she was over worked by the long hours and the many customers she had to service. The food was ok but not great. Expect to be seated very close to the next table. This is a turn and burn type of restaurant.

Laura P.,"Sacramento, United States",0,4,,5.0,31/3/2013,"On Saturday, my husband was taking a test at Cal Expo.  When he was done we decided to get a late lunch.  We've never been to The Cheesecake Factory before so we picked it. It was about 3pm when we arrived. We only had to wait about  2 or 3 minutes for a table. I was surprised by how big the menu was, but I don't think it was too big since it had breakfast, lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch.  We decided on the Vietnamese Tacos for our appetizer and I ordered the Factory meatloaf lunch favorites.  My husband chose the Chinese Chicken Salad. The tacos were excellent,  maybe my favorite of the meal.  My meatloaf was great as well.  My husband's salad was huge -- I thought the lunch portions were generous. I didn't eat all mine in order to save room for cheesecake.  The service was excellent our waitress was friendly, sweet and knowledgeable. I had lots of questions about the menu; she answered all of them with out any problems.  She definitely helped make the meal enjoyable.  I asked for things; I got them promptly.  I never had to ask for water.  It was refilled throughout the meal.  Since I was only drinking water, that was nice.   I will definitely will be back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=880

Jess D.,"Placerville, United States",3,24,3,3.0,27/12/2013,"Went here last night with a semi big group, bout 8 of us. I thoroughly enjoy the food here. I always indulge on the shrimp BLT. We waited for about 35 min with our party to be sat, which wasn't really an issue because we (my boyfriend and I) each ordered a drink. Crown and coke, the same drink we enjoy ANYWHERE we go out to. And by the time we had been sat to order we had about finished our first drink and ordered a 2nd. As our drinks came I began to enjoy mine, but my boyfriend insisted his was not crown and coke. He was going to settle, but at $10 a drink I felt the need to speak up. As the waitress returned I explained the situation, she began to say, ""no I watched him open a new bottle and pour it"", my boyfriend didn't argue and she left. He tried to continue sipping it, but just couldn't handle it as he said it tasted like spiced rum. Point blank I tried his drink and in fact it WAS NOT crown and coke and I found someone who actually cared and returned the drink. Our waitress returned and fed the same excuse she did before. But with the return that she would comp it since we weren't satisfied. I can't handle people like that. You work in the food industry, even if it WAS crown and coke, if we didn't like the taste, I believe you would make a new one or even better find a resolution so both parties feel fair!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=880

I had the New Orleans shrimp with white rice And oh my goodness, the flavors were amazing. The sauce that the shrimp came in was to die for, I ate every single bite (which I later regretted because it was so much food and I was like, disgustingly full...lol). The mound of white rice that came with it made me full even faster.  The cons: I came with A large group of about 18 and was not very happy at All with the 85 dollar included gratuity that came on the tab. Call me a cheap skate and oldshool but I thought tips were optional and awarded to wAiters and waitresses that went above and beyond to actually deserve the tip? Sorry, wasn't feeling that At all. Also, some of our party was a little tardy for dinner so when they got there, we had to shift around the table to fit them in. This was after the waiter had come to take everyone's drink orders.    So when he came back, he was extremely frustrated because it messed up the orderS he had alreAdy written down because I guess they were in a specific order. I thought waiters were never supposed to let us see 'em sweat?! His frustration with everyone made ME frustrated and added to my irritation with the included gratuity at the end of the tab. He also was hesitant when we asked him to split the tab for us so everyone could pay separately. Later I found out that the reason he put up such a fuss about the tab was because If he divided the tabs, the gratuity wouldn't hAve been included. Ugh! He made up some bs lie about splitting each tab would take like 5 mins each. Yeah right! Other than the waiter service we received, this place was great. The dark setting And ambience makes it a great place for a first date or romantic dinner. It was clean, roomy and well organized.  Last but not least, the red velvet cheesecake and white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecakes were delish. The latter was a little  (well actually a LOT) on the sweet side but it was good.

There is a huge menu offering several varieties of food such as teriyaki chicken on rice, chicken enchiladas, hamburgers, Alfredo pasta, salmon, and much much more. The drink menu is also very impressive. Although, there have been several occasions where I've observed the bartender over pouring the drinks. I once received a rum and coke that was clear, as if no coke was added. The cheesecake menu is as delicious as it sounds. I always end up taking a slice or two of cheesecake home to indulge in later. They have a large kid's friendly menu. This comes in handy when I take my toddler because he's a very picky eater. The waiters, waitresses, and hosts are all very friendly, attentive, and courteous to their customers. The restaurant itself is very clean, classy, and spacious. It is a restaurant someone can easily go to dressed casually or dressed to impress. They offer intimate tables for couples both indoors and outdoors. They also offer large tables and booths for larger parties and families. This, Olive Garden, and Chiles are my three favorite restaurants to go to on a date with my husband, out with friends, and with the entire family.

Kim N.,"South Bay, United States",2945,9798,55713,4.0,21/1/2008,"It's funny how polarized opinions of the Cheesecake Factory are. People either really love it or they hate it. Since I grew up with it during my younger years in SoCal it's got that weird comfort food/chain thing going on for me. I can appreciate the gluttony of American excess at it's best but there are certain drawbacks I try to avoid, namely the ridiculously long lines without reservations.  How to avoid that? Go to it on a Sunday night at 10:45pm. Now I'm a night owl and all but this is even late for me. However, when you're stuck in the Sierras because people don't know how to got damn' drive when it snows and there's a chain control, you look for what you can after 10pm in the Sacramento area. After a grueling few hours driving slower than molasses, eating establishments were dropping like flies and In-N-Out, TGIFridays, and Murder Burger (yes I said MURDER) weren't going to cut. We wanted to sit down, stretch out and relax our weary selves. Got the ranch house burger with steak, bacon, mushrooms and cheese. Wow, they actually got medium rare correct. Big plus points for that. The burger was huge and the attempt to pick  it up was complete failure, so I ended up cutting it in half and only finishing half.  After that and a few refills of coke, I sugar'd up some more with a slice of lemon, raspberry cheesecake. Since it was a long weekend the place was actually surprisingly busy for that late at night. Lots of high school kids and this creepy dude that sat next to us. Even a bday celebration broke out. Service was good and we felt taken care of. I have to admit I felt pretty darn good about my experience here with the  long day we had.

But sometimes you can get servers that act a little ""cocky"" because there servers at ""cheesecake factory"".  I think this place is too overrated. It seems like people in Sac make such a big deal out of this restaurant. Maybe because it's the only cheesecake factory in the area. Although I think they just opened one in Roseville.

He proceeded to ignore us except to take our entire (drink/app) order and bring it to us. Normally I'll brush off bad service because I get it but this was obnoxious. If you're having a bad day or you're irritated, don't take it out on your customers.  The plus side? The factory nachos with spicy chicken were amazing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=300
Melissa P.,"Sacramento, United States",41,4,,2.0,31/5/2017,"My office called in an order yesterday for lunch (curbside pickup up). I arrived, called to let them know I was there and they promptly came out with my order.. Or so I thought... When I got back to work I found out that half the order was missing. My boss called and sure enough they said they had the rest of it.. And that they would have a manager make it right... So back in the car I go to get the rest of order... Again they quickly bring the food out... And tell me that they gave us 2 free cheesecakes.... Valued at$18.00... Kinda nice gesture except we still didn't get the original low carb cheesecake that we had ordered and no one in the office could eat the ones they gave us. The food was good but the service was horrible and it took me about an hour with both trips to pick up an order that was placed ahead of time...Disappointed for sure.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=300
Kelly M.,"Paradise, United States",4,11,8,1.0,11/2/2016,"A sad experience at the Cheesecake Factory today! The buffalo kicker appetizer was cooked in oil that was too cold resulting in grease, grease and more grease. My server was pleasant when she brought me a new order, exactly the same as before-inedible.  My Kobe burger ordered medium-well was charred to oblivion, far past what I asked for. The meat was dry and burned on the bottom. The 'sauteed' mushrooms were dry and raw, also inedible. The sweet potato fries were cold and tasteless.  The upside? Good service and delicious iced tea. But $35 for mostly inedible food is a crying shame.  Stick with the Cheesecake, folks.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=300
Heidi D.,"Santa Rosa, United States",204,554,1076,2.0,23/5/2014,"(Wrong restaurant for the pics I posted! Sorry. Those are California Pizza Kitchen) It's a chain. Crazy packed on Saturday night and when we finally did get a seat, I'm pretty sure it was the most cramped spot in the restaurant.  Oh well, it was only the two of us.  We ordered ... Loaded Baked Potato tots - pretty good but a couple were sufficient, left a lot behind. Fire Roasted Chile Rellenos - too greasy and breaded to balance out the flavor. Even took off the breading but it wasn't tasty enough to repeat. Tex Mex Egg rolls - they were ok. Cheesecake #1 - Vanilla Bean - favorite bites of the night Cheesecake #2 - 30th Anniversary - it was ok. :) You pay for it being a chain. Not for the quality. Oh, very tasty Moscow Mule though. :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=300
Elma B.,"Livermore, United States",2,31,9,5.0,30/4/2017,"We were out celebrating my husbands birthday with the family, and decided to go to Cheese cake factory since he's never been to this restaurant.  We walked into the restaurant to make reservations for 9, and the host asked us if we were willing to sit outside, it was a pretty warm night, and we agreed, but were told there would be about 45 minute to be seated.  We were given a pager after about a 40 minute wait the pager went off, checked in with the host and they had a table inside of the restaurant for us.  We were greeted  by our server and was given menus, he promptly asked us for our drink of choice, I ordered a Pineapple Mojito which was delicious, the ONLY thing that bothered me with the restaurant was the lighting, it was difficult to read the menu since the lights were so dim. I decided to pull my cell phone out to use the flashlight feature on my phone.  I choose the Thai Lettuce Chicken wraps, the food was delicious.  We were too full to order dessert, our waiter brought out a Sunday with a candle and they sang HB to him.  We had a wonderful experience, the food was amazing delicious, Thank you for a Great experience, KUDDOS to the entire staff, we will definitely come back to dine again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=300
Sabrina Y.,"Sacramento, United States",0,8,,1.0,26/3/2017,"Hmm worst service yet! Told us the wait was 15 mins. Waited 24 mins. We then get buzzed for our table, but a lady walks in and says she needs a table of 5 and the hostess directs someone to seat her right away when her party isn't even here yet. So we stood there waiting for them to finish there conversation for an extra 3-4 mins. We were finally able to hand her our buzzard and were told to wait where we were. The hostess' talked among themselves for another few minutes so I ask the hostess are we going to be seated because we've been waiting an ongoing 7+ minutes? She says yes and then turns to other hostess to say some things about me. Clearly you looking at me and whispering shows your attitude towards me. We waited another 5 minutes before being seated. Mind you we've already been waiting 24 mins, get buzzed for a table and are still waiting an extra 10+ minutes to be seated. Don't buzz someone for a table and continue to seat other people that are buzzed after us and walk in after us. That's rude and since it's your policy of first come first serve for tables, why even seat other people before the ones who've been waiting the longest.   We also asked the hostess for a high chair as you can clearly see my child was not walking yet. The hostess was rude and had a very obnoxious attitude about grabbing the high chair.  Food came out quick and we were able to order quick. But 1 star for the lack of front of the house service. Definitely need better ladies with better attitudes and customer service to work the front.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=300

Rainie A.,"Elk Grove, United States",47,10,10,3.0,11/9/2015,"A Thursday night, busy but no wait and plenty of tables open. Our server took forever to come over to take our orders and just as long to drop off our check. He was friendly, but you could tell he was starting to stress out. The bread basket was below average. I'm not fond of the wheat bread. It was a bit sweet and hard. I ordered the sweet tamale as an appetizer, very delicious, but I think it works better without the salsa, sour cream, and avocado since it was sweet. My entree was the chicken madeira. It was tender, topped with asparagus and mushrooms, and the sauce was good. The chicken itself had no flavor. The mashed potatoes were my favorite part. My friend ordered the chicken teriyaki. NEVER order Asian dishes from a non-Asian restaurant. It was almost 20 dollars for a plate of hard white rice and mediocre chicken. The maraschino cherry garnish was definitely interesting to see on the plate.... All in all, not a very good place to eat. Will come again to try something else if I ever feel like overpaying and sitting in a dark, cold room. PS I saw the Eye of Sauron.... Many of them. I wonder who else knows what I'm talking about xD",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=300

I don't care what time of day it is...I'm ordering cheesecake... because it is mind blowingly delicious. Just 4 stars because, seriously, it's too expensive. But, then, so is crack - and this is so much better. (I really don't know that ...because I don't use crack.)  This place is always packed, but we usually get our cheesecake to go, which doesn't take too long. Get this...I almost always order plain cheesecake. No cookie,candy,frosting, etc. People, people... it doesn't need all of that...maybe some strawberries - or chocolate crust variation.

Ai M.,"Sacramento, United States",3,33,21,1.0,27/2/2017,"So, I normally do curbside pick up as its handy when I'm pregnant and ready to pop but still need to satisfy my cravings. I also normally give a tip but lately this restaurant's service is going down hill.  I called in advance and they said it will take 20 minutes to get the food ready. I gave them 35 minutes as I don't like waiting. Called told them I've arrived-gave them my car make which store I'm facing and that I have cash so please just bring out the food. This restaurant doesn't have a card reader  like other restaurants and even if you give them cash, they take your cash then goes back in to get your food--a long drawn out process that could be more efficient. Regardless, seven minutes waiting and still no food. I called and asked them what's up? The lady didn't even apologize, and said the food will come out and hung up on me. Then a guy manager (I'm guessing as he is wearing a dress shirt and tie) comes out after 13 minutes (from when I first called) and said I need to secure payment first before I can bring out the food--even though I had exact cash. I've been coming here every week and normally this doesn't happen--again long drawn out process. Gave him the money, went back in to get my food, after five minutes, he came back out again with my food--mind you now I just want to leave and who knows if they've now spit on my food as I was already annoyed that they didn't come out with my food. The manager started taking out the food from the bag to show me each food, I was afraid the food might fall. I asked to just hand me the food and I can look while he is in front of me. I wanted to check as two weeks prior they messed up and gave me crab bites when I ordered and was charged for crab cakes (diff between $13 or so dollars to $7 or so dollars if memory serves me right and yes when I brought this up, they didn't offer a refund or an apology). Nevertheless, this is my last time going to this location.  Poor service, long and drawn out, not at all efficient, crab cakes is cold as hell, the salmon on my kale salad also cold. Normally, it should still be hot but not this time. 18 minutes to bring out food--ridiculous. And if any one was wondering, there were times that when they take this long, I just went in to get my food--well guess what, its even ridiculous as they ignore you and help out others that are trying to buy in the bakery section. They don't know the meaning of first come, first serve. I guess they figure that it takes awhile to walk to the kitchen to get my food where the people who wants cheesecakes can be helped asap because they clear them out first before trying to get my food.

Kenneth L.,"Saratoga, United States",213,388,414,4.0,24/2/2015,"My boyfriend and I went on a rainy Friday because we got the deal where you buy a Chessecake $25 giftcard and get 2 free cheesecakes. The wait was short and the food here is always good. The ordered the Chicken Bellagio and it filled me up fast. The dish has pesto angel hair pasta topped with a crispy chicken, arugula and prosciutto. The waiter was dumb and told us that the coupons for the free cheesecakes didn't work saying they have already been used. We were stumped cause it was our first time using it so we found her excuse to be stupid and asked for her to run the coupons again and it worked! She recommended me to get a cheesecake that I sorta did not like but whatever. I shall just stick to my originals, Fresh strawberry cheesecake. Can't go wrong with the originals. She recommended me the Raspberry cheesecake which was fine, but not the best.  I usually come here with the mindset that my meal will be roughly $20 after tip and tax. The chicken bellagio is $14 give or take. All in all, the food here is good and that's all the matters!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=300
Eric C.,"Carmichael, United States",396,183,1044,2.0,25/11/2015,"I really hate to give such a glorious looking place two stars, but in my experiences here -- this place just isn't ""all that!""  If you are just going for dessert, this place is an easy four stars!  Seriously, they do sweets up wonderfully and I have to give respect where respect is due.  That being said, let me tell the rest of the story like it is...      First of all, this place is beautiful inside and out.  When you walk inside you kind of expect to have an extra special experience.  It's always been clean during my experiences here and the staff is most often very friendly and prompt.  Those are the high marks.        The menu is way too big.  I think it is fantastic to have such a wide variety of food available to diners, but this menu takes way too long to browse through if you have no idea what you want to eat.  I am not sure if they have designed it that way for the customer to order appetizers while trying to decide on an entree, but if it is...  It's not cool.  Also, if you are dining in the evening, some of the dining rooms are extremely dark.  My eyesight isn't what it once used to be, so it is hard to read a bloated menu in the dark.      The food...  I can't remember everything I have eaten in the past, but I know nothing has blown my socks off enough to make me remember it.  Last night I tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (I would have taken a photo, but it was too dark in the dining room we were in).  When it got to the table it looked great, but there was no smell to it.  You should be able to smell good food when it is sitting in front of you.  The bowtie pasta was a little too molto al dente for me.  Not only that, there was very little flavor in the sauce.  The parmesan encrusted chicken was moist inside and crisp on the outside, but there was absolutely no seasoning in/on the chicken.  I ate about a fourth of the dish when I thought about drowning the rest in Sriracha.  By the time our waiter came by, I had already lost interest in the dish and had him take it away.  My girlfriend and her mother enjoyed their bacon-bacon burgers.  They also told me, after seeing I was not pleased, that I should try their nachos.  I have had their Mac-n-Cheese burger before and it is a decent burger, but it is nowhere near the goodness that should come with a $12 price tag; moreover, when I come to a place like this...  My first inclination is NOT to order a burger or nachos.  I can get a much better burger for half the price at The Habit (I'm not exaggerating either).  $17 for an overly-bland pasta dish is just unacceptable.  If you are going to run this place with a high end appearance, you should at least serve memorable food.        There is one thing I will remember about this place.  The reason why my girlfriend and her mom wanted to eat here last night was to pick up a Pumpkin Cheesecake for Thanksgiving.  When we saw that it was $52, we decided just to have dinner and skip the reason for showing up in the first place.  Ha!  I hate to hand out two star reviews, but from the handful of times I have been here, it is clear that The Cheesecake Factory NEEDS to step up it's game.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sacramento?start=300
Narin K.,"North Natomas, Sacramento, United States",0,2,,1.0,23/2/2017,"This was the worst experience I have ever had. We arrived at approximately 8:15pm and were seated pretty promptly, there was maybe a 10 minute wait if that. Our server came over and took our order short after, everything seemed to being just fine. It all started going down hill when after 30-45 minutes, we were still sitting there with no food. At this point my 4 year old daughter is licking mayonnaise from an appetizer she devoured. During this wait the server did come around maybe twice to say ""it was just going to take a little longer"". Now after an hour, I was ready to get up and leave, my daughter was STARVING. I myself have been a waitress before and can most definitely understand when the restaurant is busy however from the looks of it, there was no possible way we should have waited over an hour for our food.
