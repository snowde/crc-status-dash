Chloe R.,"Converse, TX",70,10,1,5.0,9/14/2017,"We love coming here purely just for the food but this time was way different. Over servers names is Pedro and he did amazing! We didn't have to ask him for anything! For example my girlfriend asked for an I sweet tea and he brought her just that with lemons, and sugar and a spoon! He anticipated all over our needs!

Christina T.,"San Antonio, TX",12,93,21,3.0,4/5/2017,"Usually their food is good. I'm giving them 3 stars because half of the $122 order was correct and tasty. The egg roll sampler comes with avocado egg rolls, southwestern egg rolls, cuban ones and salmon ones. I substituted the salmon ones for more cuban ones and they tasted like tuna fish. They were also cold, greasy and the acocado was brown. Plus they forgot one of the sauces.  My stuffed chicken was just a casserole. It said on the menu ""stuffed corn tortillas"" with chicken. These were just laid in there with a bunch of stuff on top and was cold as well.  I spoke to the manager and he didn't offer my money back nor to come pick up fresher food. I only wanted the egg rolls refunded or fresh ones and my chicken plate made fresh. I go there all the time and they do make mistakes, but not usually cold food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=40
John R.,"Fredericksburg, TX",222,16,2,2.0,7/22/2017,"This restaurant is so damn loud!  We've been to plenty of Cheesecake Factories and even the one at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas is more quiet!  They tried telling us that seating us in the bar area was considered a dining room.  When asked to be seated somewhere else, we were told we'd have to go back on the waiting list.  That's crap!  We love Cheesecake Factory but will NEVER come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=40
Javy G.,"San Antonio, TX",1,9,1,2.0,8/13/2017,"Today's was just eh.  If it wasn't for the food being on par as always, then I'd probably have more say about the challenges between service and the kitchen.   First we got sat like sardines as a 4 top next to two 7 tops with both of the extra chairs squeezing us in.  Secondly,  my wife's order had her side messed up and was overlooked (sweet potato fries and we got regular).  Water cup was empty for 10 minutes and the beer I order between apps and lunch came during dessert and it was warm.  The frosted mug wasn't frosted and it's 3:40 on a Sunday.  Disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=40
Muñeca J.,"Converse, TX",0,4,1,3.0,4/30/2016,"I have been to this location several times before and I've always been pleased with the service and the food.  Yesterday was a different story. I had a friend visiting from out of town who had come up to her son's graduation at Fort Sam. We went to The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate after his graduation. I ordered my usual Spicy Cashew Chicken (which I love). Only to find that the chicken was not thoroughly cooked. I notified my server, who had the manager come over. The manager proceeded to tell me that the chicken was cooked... although the chicken was PINK!  I was so upset not because the chicken wasn't done, but because the manager treated me like an idiot who does not know what cooked chicken looks like. He could've just apologized. The only reason I'm giving three stars is because of all the other positive experiences I've had at this Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=40
Shanita M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,1,1.0,6/4/2017,"I have not eaten at the Factory in over 3yrs. Decided to revisit a few reviews to decide which location was best. Neither locations had the reviews I look for. Settled for the location nearest home.  Arrived at the restaurant and luckily, we didn't have much of a wait. The place was pretty busy. While sitting, we waited only 5mins and then our server arrived. I am not new to CS, and have been extremely disappointed by the lack of it in restaurants. He took our drink order and left for 10mins. Upon our wait, we noticed the table who was seated after us were receiving bread. We did not get that. We asked the lady server if everyone gets bread, she said yes. We then asked our server, Eric R, if everyone was supposed to get bread. He confirmed. Did not apologize for not offering nor did he offer after I asked, just asked me if I knew what I wanted to order. I noticed Eric would move around us and tend to the tables next to us more than our and when he made eye contact with me, would act as if he did not and walk away. Eric did not come back asking us about anything. One time he stopped and poorly refilled our drinks. Reaching over my food to poor ice from one cup into my cup and then tea. I don't know where that cup of ice came from because he did not come directly to my table with those items.  Every time we mentioned something we needed he would replay with an annoyed demeanor and not giving us undivided attention, answering while walking away. Disgusting. I give this a one because I am huge on service. Yes the food was good but the restaurant industry needs to better train. Where is the hospitality? I will not be eating here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=40
ZGabbs T.,"San Antonio, TX",92,5,4,1.0,2/22/2017,"I almost always order the Louisiana Chicken pasta with spaghetti noodles as a substitute to the bow tie pasta.  It has been pretty consistent in the past, but sadly that all ended today when I got home and realized all the noodles in my dish was over cooked times 2 and the presentation was sloppy! I even found all sorts of other types of noodles in my food.  It looked so terrible I couldn't even fathom the thought of eating it.  Called the management and all they could offer was to mail me a gift card. I suggested that I could go by tomorrow and pick up a fresh dish, but he declined that.  I really just should be given my money back because after this ordeal I don't want to return to use this gift card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=40
Anneli K.,"San Antonio, TX",1,17,3,2.0,5/26/2017,"There is ZERO excuse for two slices of cheesecake to go to take 25 minutes from the time I was rung up to the time I had my order. The only reason I got my take-out order that soon was because I went back up to ask where it was. In those 25 minutes, servers and management were around and behind the counter screwing around as though they didn't have customers still waiting. If it weren't for the fact that their product tastes good, this would have been a 1-star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=40
carissa t.,"Scott AFB, IL",1,30,,2.0,4/29/2017,"After being out of the country for a few years, I was super excited to bring my family for their first-ever CCF experience (also my son's birthday). What a huge disappointment when compared to my last visit years ago....the menu has changed and not for the better; our food all came out at different times, leaving the birthday boy sitting for about 5-10 minutes while all the rest of the table had their meals; the food itself was ""meh"" at best. I had crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp; I've definitely had better-tasting dishes from a frozen box. Not only that, I nearly choked on what I thought was a piece of pineapple, but turned out to be a pineapple-chunk-sized piece of ginger. Ouch. My son's kid-sized pizza and our buffalo strips also looked and tasted like they came from a freezer. I have no problem paying for good food, but this wasn't. The 2 stars are for the drinks (Long Island actually had some kick to it and milkshakes were huge and tasty) and service. We had 2 different servers due to shift change (Christian and Juliette, I think?) and they were both very attentive (not their fault the kitchen couldn't get their timing together). Overall though, I don't plan on coming back anytime soon, if ever.  If this is an example of what CCF has become, it's no wonder Penny wanted to quit",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=40

Hoa L.,"San Antonio, TX",128,341,597,4.0,6/22/2015,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory a few times, but this time must be the best in service and food. I came with a friend and we ordered the Chicken Madeira and Thai lettuce wraps.  Both came out superb in flavor and portion size. I enjoy the flavor of the chicken and also the fact that it is not too heavy and comes with a warm side of mashed potatoes. Definitely, the definition of home cooked meals and comfort food without the extreme calories.  The lettuce wraps are a bit messy, but I like how they use the butter lettuce. It gives a softer flavor and wraps better. It's also a great portion size.  We also ordered a slice of cheesecake, which is definitely a must-do when going to The Factory.  Our service was great and the waitress continued to offer us water and service even when we were done eating and just chatting away.

I ordered a combination dish ""steak Diane"" with Salmon which the price is decent. However when I tasted the food, I was a but disappointed. The steak sauce is superb but the steak was bland and needed much more seasoning.

We must have been seated under the speakers at our table for 7. The music was too loud to carry a conversation without having to elevate our voices in order to hear one another. Food=wow! I love that there were several at our table who ordered salmon and all 4 of us had a different salmon dish. I ordered the Salmon Genovese. This was prepared pan seared with tomatoes, green beans, roasted artichokes and a hint of lemon. Under the salmon laid a nice portion of couscous and it was surrounded by a moat of basil almond pesto sauce. I am a pesto maker and I know good pesto-this was prepared with almonds which had a unique and wonderful taste. I will order this again!  Everyone was raving about their food.

Jacqueline J.,"San Antonio, TX",437,168,935,5.0,2/14/2015,"I Thoroughly enjoyed my Valentine's Meal at the Cheesecake Factory today.  I slipped into the bar and ordered the orange Chicken and Banana Cream cheesecake off of the lunch menu.  As I expected the line was out the door, so a quick peak at an empty stool had me zigzagging to the barstool.   I was served rather quickly and my meal was incredible. To top it off for 12.95, the portion rivaled that of my favorite PF Changs.

It's a good place to eat and of course, the cheesecake is good with a wide variety but the menu for regular entrees is too busy and usually hard to navigate.

Stephanie M.,"San Antonio, TX",157,179,37,4.0,12/24/2013,"I was a bit nervous when my boyfriend and his niece wanted to just drop in to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at the North Star Mall without a reservation... It was nearly 8pm on a Sunday, and I thought we would wait half a lifetime to be seated at a table.  Thankfully, we were seated immediately and the food came out relatively quickly... although all without the hostess giving eye-contact as to where we would be seated--- I realize all the info is on the screen, but I feel our presence wasn't really recognized; just an odd feeling when first walking into a restaurant. Get here EARLY if you have a large group... And you need at least half of your people present at the restaurant before they will seat you.  And even though you might get lucky, I would still put a reservation in before attempting to eat here. Food has always been melt-in-your-mouth good here.  We recently tried the grilled artichoke from the ""skinilicious menu"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it... I think the mustard/type sauce it was drizzled with was not necessary, as the garlic aioli was plenty flavorful for the artichoke. The niece ordered her favorite spaghetti with meat sauce--- has a good spice to it that she enjoys.  Boyfriend ordered the garilc pasta and he enjoyed it too.  I had the pasta carbonara with the chicken, and it was SO good!! Not your homemade carbonara, but a great carbonara-inspired dish. Also, your life will be so much happier and carefree if you just don't even look at how many calories their regular-menu items are.  Enjoy every bite!

Stephanie A.,"San Antonio, TX",91,103,316,2.0,8/27/2015,"I cringe when I a friend or family member decides to have their special occasion at this establishment. Not because the service is bad, or the restaurant is dirty, but because this establishment is sincerely overrated. Here's why: - 99.9% of the regular menu has at least 1,000 calories or more, per dish (even a waiter confirmed this).  (They recently implemented a skinny menu, which had 600 or less calories per dish. *sigh of relief*).  -The cheesecake packs a strong rush of sugar that made my hands swell and pulsate (is that normal?). Once again, add another 800 to 1,000 worth of calories to your dinner... you may be close to ingesting 3,000 calories with an appetizer, meal, alcoholic beverage, and dessert if you wish. I have had better tasting cheesecake elsewhere, it is not all that great....seriously. -The dishes are very much overpriced for the quality and taste that is served. $12 for a small Happy Meal sized Turkey Burger and side salad. I honestly have had better tasting food elsewhere. I don't mind paying a shiny penny here and there, but I expect quality and good taste.  -The parking is horrible at North Star Mall to begin with, and the parking lot in front of the restaurant is always packed. May be due to half of the parking being occupied by Valet.  -There's normally a wait to be seated. This place does tend to get packed during lunch and dinner.  Now let me just say, the interior has a very palatial and relaxed ambiance. Dim lighting and relaxing chairs. Felt very cozy. The customer service was good, but the staff seem to be very busy helping multiple tables.  Overall, I would not recommend this establishment.

I had my waiter come back three separate times after we ate when we ordered our cheesecake, to tell me that every choice I made for cheesecake was out and not available until I gave up and decided to not get any cheesecake, which was the entire purpose of going there in the first place.

Nikki I.,"Dallas, TX",192,86,25,5.0,12/8/2013,"I truly enjoyed my experience here at Te Cheesecake Factory. This was my first time to go to one in SA but I have visited one in Dallas. We waited about 10 mins to be seated and this was around 9:45pm. Our waiter was so nice she had a great personality and continuously checked up on us. We ordered a bottle of wine to start off our meal. When our waiter brought it out she let us try it first and then poured us full glasses. We ordered fried cheese for our appetizer, when they were brought out they were cold. Since that was the last batch of fried cheese out waiter compensated us with these delicious fried Mac n cheese balls.....AMAZING! I ordered the Spicy Jamaican chicken and shrimp.

Rude staff, rude management, soup spilled down my back, my friends foot was cut by a plate shard which a server had dropped and dirty bar rag was provided to clean the bleeding wound... That kind of AWFUL. After a near 2 hour wait and the aforementioned disaster, the awful experience ended with a blah meal to top everything off. So even on top of my seething hatred for the company, the food was less than good.Haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory since. Until now. Service was excellent. My guest nor I were never in any danger of being covered in our own entree or cut with dinnerware. PLUS. But what really won me over was the Baja Hash. It was off the charts good.

My only concern is that both of the last two times I have eaten in this location we have been spilled on. This last time a busser tried to carry way too much from a table and she dropped an entire pitcher of iced tea on the floor.

Donovan T.,"San Antonio, TX",315,372,371,2.0,11/23/2013,Nothing high end about this high end restaurant... Very disappointed and this was not my first time at a Cheesecake Factory. I will write this review in bullet format... - Price.. $7.50 for a slice of cheese cake I feel is a little expensive. But to each his/her own. - The main issue I had at this location was the climate. It was 37°F is San Antonio this night and someone thought it was a good idea to continue to pump cold A/C into the restaurant. By my second bite into my hard pasta it was cold. It was so cold inside that we cut our dinner short and got our food to go.  As I am shivering trying to enjoy myself I look around and other people are still wearing their jackets bundled up. (i just wanted to make sure that I was not the only one) - The food.. My food was not hot to begin with and top that with the cold air and you might as well serve dinner topped with ice chips. My pasta was hard completely under cooked. If you are going to charge $20 for some noodles then it better be prodigious.  - Server.. Our server was good. I just don't think she knew how to handle my concerns. But that's what Yelp is for. Also out of all the higher end restaurants I have ever eaten at this is the only on that DOES NOT box the leftovers for you.  PS. If any body with power at the Cheesecake Factory reads this.

Clarence J.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",60,1219,82,3.0,1/25/2014,"Yes, it's a chain, and one that covers a massively wide assortment of food, but the taste and atmosphere entertain me and I keep returning for more than just the amazing cheesecake.  I went to try the cheesecake long ago and have been going back regularly ever since to try more and more of the food.  I haven't gone wrong yet . . . and have occasionally even finished a whole plate. (Only when I'm sure I'll still have room for cheesecake, of course.)  I still find the better part of valor is to split the plate in half and plan to take the second half home for leftovers. (Or I guess you could share with whoever you're eating with and not have any left to enjoy later . . . but I'm not that nice.)  That said, there are plenty of restaurants that do some of the individual menu items/styles better, but I thoroughly enjoy The Cheesecake Factory as a place where I can go for just about anything and get consistent quality and a decent amount (in a severe understatement) of food for what I pay, and where the service has always been good. Don't go to the Cheesecake Factory for a nice quiet meal unless you hit the narrow window between lunch and dinner.  Otherwise it can be a study in controlled chaos, noisewise -- the most romantic meal will leave you hoarse from yelling to each other by the end of the night.  That said, as with all The Cheesecake Factories, the dark wood, black leather cushions, and deep red, orange, and brass (?) decoration -- as well as the myriad booths -- keeps the atmosphere warm and intimate despite the size of the restaurant. My only wish is that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best.  So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have become extinct, and it's a complete travesty.  Sigh...  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=160

Amy R.,"San Antonio, TX",369,585,55,4.0,6/9/2012,"I've always had fantastic service here at this Cheesecake Factory location (except for one time, but I've forgiven and forgotten)! Like I said, I've been here plenty of times and it can be expensive, but it's totally worth it. I have always gotten the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I never branch out, because the wraps are just amazingly delicious. There's nothing better in the world. Plus it never fails because everything is cold except the chicken and that's pretty hard to fail. I LOVE that when you go with a small child they bring out a child plate immediately when you sit which usually consists of apples, bananas and slices of bread. Keeps baby happy and keeps family happy because they don't have to deal with screaming, unhappy child. I LOVE the ambiance of this place. No matter where you sit, you don't feel like you're next to people, especially if you sit in the booths. If you sit at a table, you are close, but you don't have to - just request a booth. ;) It's really fancy and all the servers are dressed professionally and are usually really accommodating and friendly. I LOVE that there is valet parking outside of the mall. I hate shopping (check out my yelp posts, I really do hate shopping) so going to the mall for me is a freaking nightmare. I try to avoid at all costs. But sometimes you just HAVE to go, and if I ever go to Northstar Mall, I always treat myself to getting Cheesecake Factory so therefore I park in the valet (since it's free, you only have to tip the valet driver!) Bonus! Cheesecake is my favorite desert and I just love coming to the Cheesecake Factory. It is quite expensive for one slice but it's 100% worth it. I'd recommend to get the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake (mmmmmmmmm, I so want some right now). I just recently went back and had an excellent experience from our server, Esra G (what it says on our receipt). I even emailed Cheesecake Factory afterwards to compliment her and make sure she receives recognition for her outstanding service. You go to a top end restaurant and assume you'll be getting top end service, which is exactly what we received from her. Probably one of the best dining experiences we've ever had!!

The horseradish sauce was flavorless. The cheese was not melted. The total sandwich was nothing short of horrible. They need to remove this item from the menu or learn how to make it correctly.

Jessica H.,"Cibolo, TX",1,6,,1.0,1/22/2016,"**** I am just seeing that this review was kicked back and never posted. I am reposting it now because the service was that terrible!! **** Our experience there on 08/22/2014 was HORRENDOUS! We were there for my daughter's special birthday lunch. We got there, got seated and then sat waiting for 10 minutes. It was busy, but not that busy. Then the waitress took our drink order and disappeared for another 10-15 minutes. This was at 3pm in the afternoon, fully staffed, busy, but not extremely so. We had 2 hungry preschoolers and no one even brought them bread. We got up and started to leave when the waitress intercepted us and started being really pushy about us sitting back down. She kept saying, but I have your drinks! I told her we'd had enough and started to leave again. The hostess then asked if I wanted to speak to a manager. At this point I was so angry that I said yes. The manager came out and begged us to stay, insisting that he would make sure that we were taken care of and promising my daughter that he would make her birthday special. We sat back down and were promptly served by a very nice waitress. She was the best part of a bad experience. We got our drinks and then ordered. The manager came back over and was extremely pushy about us ordering an appetizer that we did not want and didn't even get until after our food arrived. The food was ok. The salads were inedibly drenched in dressing. The kids didn't even want to eat anymore because everything had taken so long. And NO ONE came and sang Happy Birthday or brought my daughter the promised dessert or anything. DO NOT LIE TO MY CHILD ON HER BIRTHDAY!!!! After all of that, the only things comped was the appetizer that we didn't even want. We WILL NOT be back!

Mario P.,"Katy, TX",72,164,370,4.0,7/14/2012,"Our waiter this evening was Cory. He provide my family and myself with very good service. The Cheese Cake Factory may be a ""chain"" restaurant but the provide a highly reliable place to always get a very good bit to eat. Today was no exception! My wife and daughter ordered the sweet tea, which is consistently good, not great, but good. I ordered a traditional on the rocks Margarita. The taste was solid, but the presentation and portion for $8.95 was lacking. It was served in a cocktail glass I'd expected to see a piña colada served in, not a margarita , plus they used regular table salt and not drink salts. I will say the reason they also did not earn a full 5 stars is I always find that unless you're at the bar. It takes long between drink orders. Now the food, I ordered the always delicious Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad! I was not disappointed again , the flavors and the freshness was outstanding! Their portions can be and are often big enough to share. Not this salad. My wife had th Renee special with chicken salad sandwich, clam chowder and side salad. This too was a great choice as well. The chowder had great taste and the chunks were not rubbery. The sandwich had a solid chicken salad mix in that was just right. The kids food was so good the parents had to sample the chicken fingers. By this point we got to full for their madden array of awesome desserts.

I've tried the Avocado Egg Rolls in the past and they are okay, but I think it's the potstickers that I really like. The cheesecake isn't bad, but once again there are too many choices.

Linda F.,"San Antonio, TX",17,63,343,4.0,6/28/2017,"The wait was totally worth it! We went Tuesday evening and according to the staff this is one of their busiest days of the week. We were entertained by the beautiful photos of various menu items displayed on two large TV screens just above the Cheesecake counter. This was actually extremely helpful because seeing all their sensational dishes displayed so prominently helped us decide what to order before we were even seated.  We also noticed the plethora (love having the opportunity to use that word) of Gluten Free menu options available on both their traditional menu, Skinnylicous menu, and the KIDS menu. Hoooooray!!! They went far beyond chicken tenders, hot dogs or mac and cheese too which impressed me.  We ordered the Grilled Salmon for our GF toddler, which included carrots and their famous mashed potatoes. It was a tough choice for our son who wanted to order everything on his little menu. They accidentally prepared the Grilled Chicken but we opted to keep it, and it was thoroughly enjoyed by one very hungry 4yr old. We added a side of Gluten Free French Fried that were also great to have as an option.   My Husband ordered his usual Chicken Madeira dish which is highly popular and for good reason.  I had my heart set on the ""steak cauliflower"" which was a vegetarian option and mostly because I was curious to see what a steak of cauliflower looked like. Unfortunately they had sold out of this dish...wow it must be good...so we asked Kery to recommend an alternative. He suggested the Eggplant Parmesan and shared that he is not a fan of eggplants but this was an amazingly delicious meal he often enjoyed.  SOLD! He was one hundred percent correct. The huge portion served eggplant cut into small discs and included a generous portion of their angel hair Pesto pasta. Delicious! Not too salty or greasy or crunchy.  We truly enjoyed our meals and had plenty to take home. I look forward to trying the cauliflower steak next time but am glad that though it was in absentia, I was able to try another entre I probably would not have chosen otherwise.

I do not eat a Cheesecake Factory often but recall they had good burgers, salads and of course ... desserts.  Service from the hostess station through checkout was exemplary. I recommend asking for Taylor to serve you. She was pleasant and helped my wife narrow down what she should try for lunch. Our food came out timely and well served.  It is unfortunately the food that was disappointing here. We started with our traditional calamari appetizer. That was served with tarter and cocktail sauce. I quickly asked for a side of marinara sauce. I never liked cocktail sauce. The calamari was obviously fried in old oil and maybe pulled out of the deep fry early. So it was mushy and had a multiplicity of flavors, none of them becoming.    Sandwiches were not better. My crispy shrimp sandwich was served on an obviously burnt and scraped bun. Oh well, I try not to eat bread any way. It wasn't long before I discovered why the calamari tasted off. Certainly they fry the shrimp and maybe chicken in the same oil. And the adjective ""crispy"" is an unfortunate miss.  My wife's steak sandwich was also sad.  Well we ordered side salads anyway and both started in on those. Hey, this is just lettuce with one tomato wedge!   Without protein in our system we both chose to skip dessert.  On departing I realized that I was happy that we only spent $50 on a lunch that we didn't eat and that at least I don't feel like I over ate.

Joyce R.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,4,,1.0,11/30/2013,"This place is terrible. As a single adult when I eat out I tend to eat at the bar. I enjoy being able to watch football and have a meal. That being said, when a restaurant has a bar it should always be a kids free zone. If you have to be 21 to order a drink you should have to be 21 to sit there. I was watching college football drink in hand and ordered a salad to start when a couple came in with a child of about 4. This kid immediately starts pulling all of the beverage napkins out of the holder and strewing them all over the bar. Did I mention that the parents sat the kid in the stool directly beside me. They could have at least put their ill behaved child in between them.  The mother then pulls a sharpie out of her purse to let the kid color on the napkins and the bar. At this point the little paper napkins are all over the bar the floor and practically in my food. I'm sorry i don't want to eat in a trash pit so i finish my salad and pay my bill. Before heading to the door I ask the manager on duty why this small child is allowed to sit at the bar and allowed to interrupt my meal while the parent ignore the child. Don't you have a policy about small children and the bar. I was clearly told that since the state of Texas doesn't have a law that prohibits children at a bar they leave it to parents. Well Mr. Manager you and the parents of ill behaved children can have you bar because I won't be back. To other who are reading this, I am a mother of grown children, and a grandmother I would not let my children or grandchild sit at a bar until they are of legal age because it is simply inappropriate. The conversations at bars can be lewd and during sport event foul mouthed. Not something a small child should be near.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=240

Adam G.,"San Antonio, TX",250,259,349,4.0,8/10/2009,"I normally try to avoid places with 500 items on the menus or who are known for desserts but also sell food.  Marie Callenders and Village Inn come to mind, but whenever discussing restaurants in mixed company invariably this place finds it's way into the conversation. My wife and I decided to meet for lunch here a few days ago and see for ourselves or perhaps that should read, taste for ourselves.  I had just learned ,that day, that Cheescake Factory tries to uphold it's lofty standards by only opening one unit in each marketplace.  That fact certainly shows in the cathedral like setting of pillars, murals, planters, marble and hell I was expecting some stained glass windows and candelabras to genuflect before to pray to the God of cream cheese. One thing is for sure, the staff is very clean, well dressed and attentive like individuals who know they work for a reputable restaurant and maintain a level of professionalism that is lacking in most moderately priced chain institutions. The menu reads like a Tolstoy novel but if you have an idea of what you are in the mood for you can skip to that category and choose something in that vein.  Based on what we had I would think that whatever you choose, it would be very good. We were there at 3pm or so, which if you don't know much about restaurant culture is the best time to get in and out quickly, and there was no wait.   Being there for lunch my wife had there soup/salad/half sandwich special for about $10.  The clam chowder was very good and loaded with clams.  Her chicken salad sandwich was delicious and kept simple with big chunks of chicken and not a lot of filler.  The house blue cheese was nice and tart and perfect for the field greens.  This platter was huge and could easily be shared by two people.  I ordered the Navajo sandwich which was simply fantastic.  The combination of chicken, avacado, very ripe tomato and fried bread tasted like a southwestern version of a puffy taco without all the mess.  Also for about $10 not a bad deal for a lunch that we easily could have shared but being our first time we wanted to sample a couple of items and take the rest home. Now where your ticket average goes up is by succumbing to the $8 pieces of cheescake.  I personally don't care for cheesecake or any dessert that is heavier than the meal but we wanted to take a couple of slices home for the kids. I have heard many rave reviews of this place and have to admit that upon my first visit I was impressed and will definitely return to navigate my way through the labyrinth of menu choices to try something new next time.

Yes it was busy because it was half-price cheesecake day but that's no excuse for a supposedly semi-classy place (ie, not Jack-in-the-Box) to have floors that are so greasy that you can barely walk in the aisles going to and from your table. Also when I left the mall-side doors were locked and the greeters kindly led me to another exit that put me into the mall where I was locked in and couldn't get out to the parking lot. So I waved my flashlight, got the managers attention, complained that the greeters should have asked me where I was trying to get to (or just automatically pointed me to the parking lot), to which he smarted off to me, saying well I'M telling you.

Samuel L.,"San Antonio, TX",16,28,,3.0,2/11/2014,"So I like to really REALLY give places a shot when it comes to rating. Whelp, unfortunately there is only so much I can say about Cheesecake Factory. First off, there aren't any reservations...what the hell is up with that?! So decided to go with my girl for an early dinner, and it was a mistake. We planned and had hoped to be eating by 530 for a possible movie after. Nope nope nope! We didn't get seated until about 6 something. As we are waiting we notice the bar area/high tables are a free for all for whomever wants. Well we are waiting behind a couple who were there before we were and it wasn't a big deal. Well these snobby ass people come and just choose to stand by the bar and in between the tables...and then proceed to make people eating uncomfortable enough they leave quickly. They then continue to take seats at an uncleaned table and wait. I wish this was policed better because I was about to crack some heads and make a mess of the place at that point. We FINALLY get seated and open the menu to see that this restaraunt doesn't know what type of food it wants to serve. It had EVERYTHING. With the risk of not specializing in a special type of food the food then becomes just mediocre. Many restaraunts have an identity, its what they make and what they are good at. Cheesecake does not know what it wants to be. After choosing a pasta dish and getting through that the only thing that was worth saving this review was the cheesecake. What would one expect since the name of the restaraunt IS THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. As we expected the cheesecake was great but not at the cost of an OKAY meal that is kind of pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=220

Melissa R.,"San Antonio, TX",39,29,29,4.0,6/22/2011,"had my first visit last night here.  Had a shiner at the bar and may i say it was as a beer should be but at times isnt.  Especially Shiner needs to be ice cold, and delicious going down especially after a long day.  Bread is spectacular both the brown and sour dough? Hard to keep from eating.  We had fried cheese which is one of my faves which i always order, that was mediocre.  The roasted pear, blue cheese and arugula pizzette appetizer was different but delicious, and especially because I normally dont like blue cheese.  The combination of the salty blue cheese with sweet pear and fresh arugula made my taste buds dance.  I ordered the meatloaf but to my surprise had mushrooms in it and the sauce!  Did I mention I am allergic to mushrooms, thank god I only had a little bite with hardly any gravy.  I made sure that it didnt state mushrooms on the menu before bringing it to their attention, and it was not on the menu like most of their dishes do have ""mushrooms"".  They were quick however to get a new order in and defintely redeemed theirselves with ""the Cuban""  crunchy outer bread, soft on the inside with cheese ooozing out.  Pork was defintely slow roasted and tender, perfect amount of mustard, pickle, ham and roasted pork.  I worked in a cuban restaurant in Tampa where we specialized in cubans and this is the best one in SA so far and so surprising to find it at cheesecake factory by accident.  To end finished it with a pina colada cheesecake with a coffee.  Coffee was devine, pina colada very light flavored and fluffy, couldnt taste the cheesecake though.  Over all I will be back to try new dishes, despite the flaw of mushrooms in the meatloaf it was bittersweet. P.S.  Had a taste of pasta carbonara from which I had first hand in Italy before.  This was an americanized version as to they put eggs in the italian version but not safe in the US.  It was so creamy, with smoked bacon flavor will defintely be back for my own plate, and not many Italian restaurants have it glad this place does.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=220

We were also in a group of 25+ and they were timely with our meals. But the 2nd time I came here with my husband truely pissed me off.  First off the food took forever and we have a 2 yr old....so you can not leave a family with a toddler with no refils of drinks or bread for over 40 minutes. By the time the food came I was over it. I put the pizza in a TO GO box and we left. As we were leaving we noticed my husbands hat was missing from inside our stroller. He asked several hosts if it dropped or if someone grabbed it. After a few people gave him the run around he left. Furious as I was I went back in and asked for a manager since all 3 hostess insisted that only a manager could open the lost and found cabinet. After I patiently waited for almost another 15 minutes with still no manager...I quickly stopped another hostess and asked about the hat. She gave me a dirty look and then reached under the register and pulled out the hat. It was shoved up behind the plugs and was covered in dust. Obviously not in the ""locked"" lost and found cabinet. She apparently knew where the hat was all along. The hat wasnt even expensive. It was a $20 hat from American Eagle.

Visit started with arriving around 8:30pm and told a 30 minute wait. Our buzzer went off roughly around 30 minutes later, great. Hostess took our pager and told us to step to the right and wait - no specific area - just wait to the right... where everyone waiting for a table is standing. We proceeded to wait for another 15 minutes with still nothing, confused if we had been overlooked since we were just standing in the middle of a crowd. The whole time I am making eye contact with the hostess and nothing. I had to approach the hostess to figure out what was happening. 5 more minutes pass and then she gives us some story about some other person had claimed our table because they are calling out names (then why the pagers???) and we would be taken to a booth. Arrive to our table and it's a small 2 top. Okay....  needless to say, the rest of the experience went downhill. Our waiter, despite being very nice (1 star) was more concerned with the larger tables around us than us. Appetizer was very good (egg roll sampler - responsible for other 1 stars). Our entrees finally came out after a long time and were barely warm at best. Neither my boyfriend and I were impressed (he got one of the combo steak and chicken plates and I got the herb salmon plate - do not recommend either). Refills took forever and despite our entrees, we were going to order a cheesecake because, surely, they couldn't mess that up. But of course, our waiter disappeared for 20 minutes caring for the table of 3 who was drinking next to us and never stopped by in the 3 times he came to their table while we had gathered plates and napkins on the table. We decided once he had come to us to not get dessert as we lost the desire to spend more money.

Jay R.,"Cypress, TX",0,13,,1.0,4/4/2017,"Terrible experience at dinner on a Monday night, we arrived at 630 pm to a mostly empty restaurant. We were seated at one of the small tables that have the shared bench and the hostess pulled one of the small tables over to make room for 4. I noticed immediately that there was a significant amount of food debris that was uncovered French fries, green beans, some large brown smashed bits what appeared to be the remains of some long gone chicken fried steak. The mess appeared to be several days old and not just left over from that day's lunch. The hostess didn't seem to recognize it or was not bothered by it and I was willing to overlook it thinking they would simply clean it up before our drinks arrived. Sadly the food and mess sat on the floor, to watch the entire ordeal we went through that night. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and my coworker, a fried catfish plate. The food arrived quickly and looked pleasing. However I checked my fish and found it to be roughly 10% cooked and very raw. I asked our waiter to have the kitchen manager come to the table so I could educate him on the quality of food leaving his kitchen and I showed him the undercooked fish and he apologized and said he would send the server back to take my order for a replacement. Fast forward 15 minutes, or server never returned, we sat there empty drinks on the table my coworker finished his meal and finally flagged down our server who appeared to only have 1 other table. It was at this point asked to speak to the restaurant manager. He was apologetic but seemed to be very uncaring about the problems with his slow inattentive wait staff, unclean floor in the dining area and poor quality of food coming out of the kitchen.  The catfish dinner was comped and we walked out to never return. If you go for dessert you might be safe but they are not cleaning the dining area I'm almost afraid of what the kitchen looks like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=60

I read a previous review that said the place isn't that great, everything has more than 1000 calories... uh yeah so... eating out mean enjoying your food and calories are a part of that. The place isn't dirty...I've had the privilege of going to 4 different establishments in different parts of the country and first hats off is to the consitency, despite a very large menu.  For those seeking less calories, go with the skinny menu, don't eat the bread or stay home.  Everytime the service has been prompt, friendly, AND despite being as busy as it always is I get what I need in a timely manner.  Everytime they quoted a time to be able to sit and wait for a table they have had us seated sooner than expected.   If you are in a rush, try dining during the week.  I also recommend figuring out what you are craving prior to looking at the menu, chicken, salad, pasta, seafood, theres quite a remarkable selection.  I have had the Mahi Salad, coffee (superb), Asian salad, vegetable salad (organic) , burgers, steaks, spaghetti, meatballs, and a different cheesecake every time.  The wine selection is as good as anywhere as well.   Overall a definite 5 stars.  Cheesecakes are delish, with a cup of fresh coffee hard to match.

A delicious flavored mojito from the friendly bartender was made quickly, and tasted fresh. I was looking for a light and quick meal, so i chose the Ahi Capriccio. For the price, I was a little disappointed in the portion size. Yes, it fills the plate, but it's paper thin. I feel like a tad more would be great, and still qualify for their ""lighter fare"" menu.

Julie G.,"San Antonio, TX",370,322,1891,3.0,3/30/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is a decent last resort for anyone looking to overpay and get sketchy service.  We come here every once in a while during lunch to share their fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and a Greek salad. I really like that their lunch specials carry on until 5:00pm. Of course, my favorite part about coming here is enjoying the warm sourdough bread before your meal. The fettuccine is consistently good and the sauce is not overpowering, try it. The sandwiches are decent, meatloaf is OK, chicken picatta is nothing to brag about and every time I've ordered the salmon I left with a tummy ache. When I do decide on splurging, I'll go with the fresh banana cream cheesecake...YUMMY!  The staff are not personable and they definitely don't care for people who share plates, my goodness the portions are HUGE. Almost every time we've come here they've treated us differently when we say we're sharing and the table next to us gets smiles and constant drink refills.  Parking is chaotic in the mall area and valet is even riskier. Make sure to save your receipts after your meal to show the valet guys for your free parking. The last time I visited they were doing construction on their valet parking area and my parking anxiety was in high gear because people were honking and waiting in long lines to get their car parked.

The place was packed on a Thursday night with middle class ladies wanting cheesecake, young people in short dresses and heels, and mall hoppers. We started with chicken potstickers and fried mashed potato tots. These appetizers were just okay and wayyy over priced for their quality. For my main course, I got the chicken katsu $14.95. The portion was huge, about 10-12 oz of panko fried Japanese chicken over brown rice with roasted veggies with a white miso sauce and a katsu glaze. My partners both got shrimp scampi with huge grilled prawns. The grilled shrimp were very good, but the portion size of the pasta was very small, especially considering these dishes cost in the $18ish range. For deserts, we got a lemon meringue cheesecake and a dulce de leche one, both were fab. The service was slow and the restrooms were filthy. Eats: - chicken potstickers - overpriced, dumpling mushy, chicken curiously loose - breaded and fried mashed potato tots - overpriced and simple - chicken katsu - excellent, huge portion, great flavor, panko breading: light and crispy Crumbs: - cheesecakes $8; sodas $3; average entree $ 17ish. - bring your gold card. - service super slow - food quality just doesn't justify these prices - men's bathroom filthy and stunk of urine   I would not come back here on my dime. The look of the uniforms and the style of the building reminded me of Copeland's of New Orleans, which is no longer here.

We were a party of about 13 people.  When the host took us to the outside seating, he said we couldn't put the tables together because they'd break. Which meant we would all have to sit at separate tables and that completely defeated the point of a group birthday dinner. The birthday girl was very upset because she had made it clear that we were all supposed to sit together.  So off to a bad start and we were ready to leave...  But when our server Ivan came out, he saved the whole night. He allowed us to move the tables together and made sure we all had a good night. He was great, helpful, fast and overall a great server.  Eventually the manager came out and told us that the birthday girl's dinner was gonna be on the house.  In the end, I was very pleased with how the situation was resolved, and again, Ivan was amazing. Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=100

Ollie T.,"Harvest, AL",0,23,8,1.0,6/18/2015,"Abysmal! I rarely eat at The Cheesecake Factory mainly because there's never been a location within 100 miles of where I've lived.  I remember going twice in the past while traveling, but not within the past few years, so we (my husband and I) decided to give this place a try while in San Antonio.  We were at the LaCantera mall the previous day and decided to eat at P.F. Chang's instead of The Cheesecake Factory there.  This was probably a mistake, as I didn't enjoy our dining experience at the San Pedro North Star Mall location! We arrived around 7:30 on a Wednesday evening (last night).  We gave our name to the attendant and asked for a booth, and she told us there would be a fifteen or so minute wait.  Fine.  Twenty minutes later, our thingy buzzed, and a different woman showed us to our table--which was dirty.  The table itself hadn't been wiped down, and there was food on the seats.  We pointed this out to the hostess, and she just looked at us.  We stood there, the three of us, rather awkwardly, and she finally wiped at the table and seat.  But it was still dirty.  She asked, ""Are you going to sit there?"" My husband flagged down a busboy, and he wiped the table and seat off with the same rag he'd been wiping everything else down with.  The seat was left wet, so I wiped it off with a napkin. At this point my husband called for the manager and asked him why we would be seated at a dirty table.  Also, when the busboy wiped the table down, the silverware and napkins had to be removed (yes, they'd set a DIRTY TABLE), and when the bread was brought out by our waiter after we finally sat down, we didn't have anything to use to butter it!  The waiter didn't even seem to notice that he'd brought us bread, butter, and we had no utensils. After bringing us bread the waiter took our drinks order and brought me the wrong thing.  I asked for Dr. Pepper and I received a Diet Something.  He said he would try the other side of the bar, and took my drink away.  He didn't bring it back--roughly twenty minutes had passed--during which we ordered our meals--before I got the chance to ask him what happened to my drink.  He disappeared and brought it back to me a couple minutes later.  Really, should I have had to ask for him to bring my drink back? Shortly before our food arrived he did replace our silverware, but we had to ask him to.   I ordered the Romano Chicken and my husband ordered the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combo.  They cooked his steak wrong.  He asked for well-done as always because neither of us enjoy raw/undercooked meat, and half of it was pink inside.  He said it tasted ""oily"" and lacked flavor.  My Romano Chicken was tasteless and super unimpressive.  The noodles were way too greasy!  My husband once again complained to the manager about the poor service and food, from the silverware situation, to my drink situation, to the steak being undercooked.  The manager, a Hispanic fellow, basically acted like he didn't care, but he did comp us on desert (which ended up being unimpressive as well--I've had better tasting cheesecake from the frozen dessert section of the supermarket). It will be a long time before we go to another Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=100

No one moves with a lot of urgency though the servers are attentive to the table. The crab wontons were quite excellent. I was disappointed in the chicken nuggets because they were incredibly salty and I couldn't finish them. The cheesecake was delicious! I think I would have enjoyed my experience more if the calorie count wasn't next to every menu item. I mean, seriously, why would I buy more if that's on the menu?!!

It was delicious, freshly muddled mint and lime and not too sweet - perfect taste. We were going to get the grilled artichoke as appetizer, but since it is a seasonal option, it was unavailable. But our bartenders got us extra fresh bread and butter out. For dinner, I had a bone in NY Strip, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My mom had a small Greek salad and the Cuban Rolls. I didn't try the salad, but the rolls were amazing! I will definitely order those as an appetizer in the future.

Felise F.,"San Antonio, TX",100,107,181,3.0,12/18/2016,"I'm a little back & forth on the rating for today's experience. 3.5 feels more appropriate. We went to try the Sunday brunch menu around 11:30 and were seated quite promptly. Our waitress was nice, but not as attentive as I believe she could've been. We only saw her twice after receiving our food from somebody else, and that was when she wordlessly plopped down a newly filled cup of coffee and continued on then returned later to see if we were ready for the check. The coffee was on point and the mugs are fairly large. My fiance ordered the Crab hash, and while he enjoyed the hollandaise sauce, eggs, & potatoes, there was hardly any crab on the plate at all. I figure if a plate's name features a particular ingredient/food it should have a good amount of it. Other than that disappointment, what WAS on the plate was good. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and a side of scrambled eggs. LOVED the pancakes! Not an overwhelming lemon flavor, but the touch of powdered sugar with the strawberries all made it a bite from heaven! My eggs on the other hand were bleh. I don't like when people's version of scrambled eggs is more like a smaller burnt omelette. It seemed like somebody let the eggs cook too long and failed to keep stirring it in the pan.  So there were a few oddities on this visit, but overall decent experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=20

Sylvie R.,"San Antonio, TX",12,5,,1.0,10/25/2017,"I should have paid attention to the previously posted bad reviews about the Cheesecake Factory @ La Canterra.  Their food is overpriced for the mediocre food offered on the menu.  That being said, I spent a great deal of my visit there exploring the novel-sized menu.  Because I cannot have anything with any kind of seeds, I also asked a lot of questions about certain items and made the waitress quite aware of my sensitivity to seeds.  The 2nd waitress that took her place at end of her shift, was also made aware.  I ordered crab bites which came with a tasty sauce that I didn't recognize and only after I was halfway through the sauce, it was apparent that it contained large mustard seeds.  I addressed this with the Manager, whose name I will not disclose, but will be calling Corporate about.  His response to the situation was ""well, would you like another sauce""; I informed him that the damage had already been done.  He offered no other recompense.  And if this incident was not enough, one of my toddler grandchildren (there were 3 of them, all under 4 years of age) broke a small plate when we were still awaiting our order; it wasn't until we were well into our meal and almost finished that they cleared the bigger pieces of glass shards from the floor.  My oldest grandchild had, in the interim, dropped her napkin and while recovering it from underneath her seat, scooped up a handful of smaller broken dish fragments and handed them to me. I'm not sure how this business keeps its doors open.  But I will be calling Corporate about both the manager's blasé attitude, and, the waitress lack of training. ADDENDUM:  Our total bill was $120.00, of which I left NO TIP, as one was NOT deserving...first time in my life I've ever done  this...it saddened me to be this mean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=20

Servers are really good except when they get a bigger table expect to be ignored if it is just the two of you. Cheesecake Factory has such a broad menu that there is something for everyone and everything is well presented and satisfying if you pick things with ingredients you like.

April M.,"San Antonio, TX",16,36,38,1.0,4/27/2017,"We frequent cheesecake factory often. I practically know the menu. Every anniversary, birthday or celebration my family, friends and I come here. I have never had a bad experience... Before today. And honestly let me say that even today, the food was delicious. Our server Brittany was friendly and the environment clean. Cheesecake has always been consistent... Not today. We placed our order, started munchin on the bread & a few minutes later our server informs us my entree wasn't available (tuna titaki salad). After that, the substitute entire i wanted wasn't available in lunch portion. OK, I can't fault them for that part but it just added to my annoyance at that point. Nevertheless, it's my friends birthday, the show must go on. Our food comes, I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp (excellent by the way!! I must give kudos where it's due) Afterwards we order dessert. You guessed it, the cheesecake i ordered is not available.  One thing after another. Now don't get me wrong, no one died today and the quality of the food served was great. Here's the kicker, (the reason for the 1 star) At this point the manager has been informed of the numerous inconveniences. I never asked to see the manager, but our server told them what all happened. I would think there would've been a discount or a comp on my bill, (keep in mind it is a birthday as well) but no. $80 tab comes I pay it AND STILL TIPPED my server 20% with a smile on my face. because I'm a good sport & it's not her fault. I didn't ask to see the manager because Im not lookin for a free meal. But I AM EXPECTING customer service. There are too many other restaurants in town and there's nothing magical in your food you don't make a steak any different than anyone else. What has set you apart is your attention to quality & of course desserts. But i'd happier spend my next $100 where my patronage is appreciated and it's valuable to you. I shouldn't have to suggest to you how to makeup for difficulties during my dining experience. So I'm not going to tell you how to manage your establishment. If you're a manager, you should know. And THAT is my complaint. NOT that you were out of ingredients or discontinued options... It's that you were aware of the multiple dissatisfactions & didn't take the time to even come by our table and extend an apology let alone comp a drink. Nothing. Bad show Cheesecake.

Waitress came back with a bottle of different IPA and said draft machine was broken. No big deal! The bottle beer was great! Coming back from restroom I see another waiter with my beer, half empty, taking it from the table and said ""you were served the wrong beer."" Okay, so why not leave the beer I half finished and bring the one I ordered in the first place to the table too or comp it!

They wanted to bring out my dinner as it was ready but not my daughters which is a total no no in the restaurant biz. I know things can happen to orders or whatever but at least comp the late meal or offer a free dessert or something! With those prices I would like to think that they had better customer service! Food was okay nothing to rave about! I do not think I would go back to that particular restaurant! Too chain like and not enough attention to quality of food and service! It all comes from the lack of good managers and good training of all staff. The Cooker Restaurants in Nashville were incredible with training staff and managers!

Ivanna H.,"Kyle, TX",58,128,124,2.0,5/6/2011,"What makes America the fattest country?? Uhh, Cheesecake Factory!! The portions are obscenely large, which makes this a great deal I suppose. However, no one should eat as much as they serve here. I've never been able to finish a meal here and everyone I ever go with is the same. What's the point of serving so much to just end up packing it to go, or worse throwing it out? I'm sure you get the point... The service at this location was terribly slow. In the middle of our meal a new waiter came up to my table and said the other waitress had to leave so he'd be taking over. He was even slower than the girl, taking absolutely too long to bring the check. The food was brought out rather quickly, so I was happy about that.  I ordered the spicy chipotle chicken pasta which is served with peppers, sweet peas, asparagus, and tortilla slices on top. Too many ingredients in my opinion, so I asked for no peppers. It was a good dish, but nothing spectacular. I did enjoy it however so I'd recommend it if you're in the mood for some spice.   Overall, I'd say this is a nice place to come and SHARE an entree. If you're still hungry afterwards I'm sure their cheesecake can fill you up. Otherwise you'll have lunch and dinner out of one meal here.

SOOOO good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
Amber M.,"San Antonio, TX",1,28,12,4.0,5/2/2014,"The food is pretty typical, but they have so many options, its hard not to please everyone. The salads are fresh and tasty options, and the pizza is decent. Sounds weird, but I love their mashed potatoes! Usually, the family gets a bunch of appetizers like the avocado eggrolls and stuffed mushrooms. Nothing to write home about. Milkshakes and cheesecake are delicious and again, they have so many options! Mostly this is a clean, novelty restaurant with unique decor and an outrageous menu. Love to stop by every now and then but the food doesn't really keep me wanting more..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
James G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,4.0,11/25/2012,I've eaten here at least 30 times and I've never had a bad experience.  The menu is huge so you can always find something tar hits the spot. My only complaint would be the tables are close together so we always ask for a booth even if we have to wait.  You can also seat yourself at the bar or the tall tables in the bar area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
Christine C.,"San Francisco, CA",254,195,228,2.0,12/4/2011,"Still overrated. Been here so many times back during my college days (different locations: NewPort, Pleasanton, Walnut Creek) and food is still okay. Over priced like the cheesecakes. Even the cheesecakes are $$ for the slice and not that yummy. Had better cheesecake. It's good for big parties. I give the service a 4-5 star. Every time I've been I've had really good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
Katherine T.,"San Antonio, TX",91,508,37,4.0,10/27/2013,I really don't want to like Cheesecake factory but I have to admit that it is consistently good and there is no better end to dinner than cheesecake! My favorite is the Oreo but all the cheesecakes are so varied and fun. The pear blue cheese flatbread is the perfect size for a light bite and very refreshing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
H P.,"San Francisco, CA",18,75,74,3.0,8/30/2011,"Do you have a small army you need to feed? Come to the Cheesecake Factory! If you are getting any of the food (ie not a slice of cheesecake), be prepared to eat for an entire day. I usually get the ""lunch"" portion of the salads, and never, ever does my hungry tummy have enough room for the entire plate. It is reasonable pricing for all this food but, most of the time I am more disgusted than satisfied. And the environment is kind of weird too, although I am weird (I admit). The decor of large columns and wall paintings is too much for this type of joint. Too over the top. If it weren't for the clients who choose this as their lunch location for my meetings, I would probably only get a couple of cheesecake slices to go.  The cheesecake, now, that is a different story. The selection of flavors is great, especially for someone who does not get along with bland flavors. Although a bit pricey, a slice of cheesecake is the perfect way to tell myself that I did a great job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
Tina E.,"Corpus Christi, TX",114,291,359,4.0,7/30/2013,"The food is good.  As far as service, I always feel like it's so busy that we're ""just another table"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
Donna H.,"San Antonio, TX",126,200,33,3.0,6/13/2013,"Wow! Finally had a so-so meal here... The white bean hummus was flavorless and the bread it came with was some undercooked, doughy disaster.

David F.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,,5.0,2/17/2015,"The food was great. I had the lunch portion of the Chipotle chicken pasta and not only was it very delicious, it was very filling.

J.R. R.,"San Antonio, TX",6,30,,5.0,11/12/2010,"This is the first time I've been to this CF.  Went to one in Indianapolis a couple of years ago and loved it, especially the service.  I wasn't disappointed this time!  I had lunch special (chicken fettuccine Alfredo) with a frozen Mango smoothie-like drink (excellent).  The bread was half-n-half home-made sour dough and dark wheat (looked like rye or pumpernickel but didn't taste like either of those).  Very tasty! Heard a woman tell a customer they change their menu every six months.  Not sure which part of the menu.  Guess I'll go back in the spring to see.  My food was excellent.  Brought a piece of strawberry cheesecake home.  Server bagged it up and included napkins and four plastic forks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
Joey H.,"Orange County, CA",0,42,4,5.0,7/20/2013,I went there with my girlfriend and when the food came to our table they had my order messed up. They were very apologetic and offered me a free soup or salad while I was waiting for my order. The waitress was really trying to make my experience a good one and the manager also came by to apologize as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
John D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,2,4.0,8/18/2013,Would get 5 stars for food but wait staff is disinterested and just something they have to deal with.  A little better attitude would go a long way for future  visits.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
Jacob W.,"Austin, TX",265,25,,4.0,7/5/2012,"If you have the opportunity you should definitely give this place a try. Great service, great food and great cheesecake (shocker I know). Unfortunately last time I went there I made the rookie mistake of not saving adequate room for dessert and was only able to finish half of it, but life goes on. Once again would strongly recommend it, seems like a great date spot too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
Abigail L.,"Cibolo, TX",306,576,1050,2.0,9/24/2010,I have been to Cheesecake Factory in other places.  The bathroom was so dirty!!!!!!  It was so gross.  There was this lady in there and I don't know what she was doing but she was using up all the paper towels.  I finally figured out that she didnt work there when she talked to me.  The food is ok.  too much on the menu to look at.  Lunch prices are so much better than the dinner prices.  Free valet parking if you eat there.  Other than that I give it a 2 because of the bathroom.  I wonder what the kitchen looked like if that bathroom was like that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
Dawn M.,"San Antonio, TX",7,19,4,3.0,1/4/2012,"Okay, I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory but how and why the hell does it take 20-30 minutes for these servers to get cheesecake out to your table?!?! I called ahead before my last visit to make sure they still had peppermint bark cheesecake (it was the day after Christmas); the guy who answered must have been too lazy to walk and actually check... he told me yes.  I arrived a mere 10 minutes later (parking was crazy) and the waitress said they were out.  OMG!!! Talk about one upset 9 month pregnant girl!!! Then after the disappointing news it took her almost 20 minutes to bring 2 pieces of cheesecake! UGH!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
Grace G.,"San Antonio, TX",73,190,368,4.0,8/5/2010,"The 1st time I went, I went back 2 other times that week. Lunch and dinner menu are good. Expect to pay $13-$30 per plate. The servers are on top of everything. Breakfast isn't all that, stick to Denny's or a taco shop for that.   I recommend the 30th Aniversary Cheesecake. Don't forget that you can park in valet for free. Just show them your receipt. It is a good place for a date night or celebration.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=200
