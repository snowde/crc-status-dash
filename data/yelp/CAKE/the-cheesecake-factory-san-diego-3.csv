Mitch B.,,545,315,1,3.0,1/10/2018,HUGE dining room and patio seating. Aaaand there's the plusses for CF. Downtown drink prices and the standard CF fare made this a 3 star experience. IF YOU GO- Gigantic menu. The amazing part is how they somehow make all the food taste the same. Go for the cheesecake. And get it to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3
Alan B.,"La Jolla Shores, San Diego, CA",264,814,3204,2.0,1/7/2018,Being a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory this time I had the worst experience. My nephew was in town and wanted to go to the cheesecake factory. So we decided to come to the cheesecake factory. When we arrived we where told the wait will be about 20 minutes. Sure enough an hour goes by and we where finally seated. After being seated a warm bread basket arrives. As we already knew what we wanted we ordered couple minutes later. So our server took are oder.  I noticed the service was way too slow. It took almost 40 minutes for are food to come. When the food came to the table it was cold. It was the first time I ever had an experience like this at any cheesecake factory. I informed our server that the salmon was cold.  It was to the point the salmon was not even eatable. So instead my nephew had cheesecake for dinner. Our server deserves 10 stars. When you have great customer service is great. End of the day the food experience was 1 star. I will return for a second chance. Overall the location is in the heart of Downtown San Diego. For me the customer service from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave was excellent. Too bad the kitchen did not do a great job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3
Jon B.,"Oceanside, CA",38,10,1,2.0,1/4/2018,"By far the worst Cheesecake Factory in San Diego. Service took forever. Waited 30 minutes when there were plenty of vacant tables. Once seated the table was missing settings and didnt have any table napkins. Our table was also super dark. Had to use phone light to read menu. The waiter Wesley was super friendly. We ordered a salad, a small dish, kids pizza, and 4 plates. Didnt have kids pizza and 1 of the plates was a wrong order. Our order took a while to come out.  Meatloaf and shrimp dish were salty. Salmon was bland. The chicken was the wrong order so we had to wait again. Wesley gave a free soup for the wait. In the end. Wesley removed the meatloaf from the bill and we got 2 cheese cakes that were delish. Over all pretty bad experience. 1 star for Wesley 1 star for the Cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3
Chris H.,"San Diego, CA",213,194,93,1.0,12/27/2017,"Wow- this place has really gone downhill. Showed up on a weeknight of all times, to find complete and utter chaos. Total lack of management oversight, lackadaisical attitude at the front desk (""yeah, like it's over an hour wait or something...""). Trip to the bathroom revealed urine on floors, trash and toilet paper overflowing onto floor (see photo). This place  really was well run when it opened a few years ago, but now? Complete lack of leadership, and it showed glaringly when the staff was confronted with a mild crowd. Food? Cold Factory Nachos, cold Coconut Chicken, cold 4 cheese pasta. Shameful. Needs a tune up, and I will  most likely not be back to this spot; Eastlake and Mission Valley are quite good still, and I really hope they get a grip on this spot- Cmon guys, it's downtown!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3
Debbie S.,"Vista, CA",423,266,2624,2.0,12/6/2017,"Stopped by last night for a late snack. Because sometimes you get the munchies and it was next door to the hotel. But ""no cheesecake for you!"" They didn't actually say that but that's how it went down.  We were seated within a few minutes but after 10 minutes still no server. It wasn't very busy. :( so we ended up buying 2 $25 gift cards for future use (gotta love their holiday special - buy a $25 gift card, get a voucher for free cheesecake) and bailed.

Court K.,"San Diego, CA",0,34,42,3.0,1/4/2018,"We wanted a place within walking distance from the Convention Center, that also served lunch specials, and this Cheesecake Factory made the cut.  It may be one of the largest locations I've ever been in; there was ample seating inside and outdoors, and STILL about 6 groups ahead of us. We were given a timer for 15 minites, but after about 5, it buzzed. I ordered ""Renee's Special,"" which included half a chicken salad sandwich, creamed chicken soup and a side salad.  The salad was tasty (nothing too special); the soup was amazing, but it was barely warm (which was weird for me, as I thought restaurant soups were made in big batches and simmered until served), so I asked our waitress if it could be heated up.  The soup was returned piping hot, and still tasty; I saved the sandwiches for home, and they were just okay.  The only other issue we experienced was the dirty table; like, REALLY dirty.  I'd return again, since the service and soup were bomb, and just ask for a cleaner table instead of ignoring the mess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3
Ramona G.,"San Diego, CA",3297,1441,1447,3.0,10/11/2017,"I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory in General but this location is just okay. I prefer the one at Fashion Valley over this one.  I've been here twice already, most recently two weeks ago when I was staying with my friend at the Hyatt for my birthday weekend we had dinner here one night with one of his co-workers.  I love the CF crab wontons but they don't have it at this location :( booo. I ended up ordering the carbonara along with an iced caramel macchiato. FYI don't get the macchiato iced, in fairness the waiter warned me it's supposed to be hot, but I wanted to try it iced. The caramel ended up being solid and hard. The carbonara was okay.

Catherine O.,"Palmdale, CA",76,19,1,2.0,1/2/2018,Honestly I never give less than 5 star review to any restaurant. I'm a food server myself and I always try to make my guest feel loved and appreciated and like family. However. At this location I would think that the people they hire would be kind and warming. But the waitress that we were first with was very rude. Our section was completely empty and she was very forgetful of us. so my family and I requested to speak to a m anager 10 times. And 10 mins later the manager came to our table. She was a very nice lady.  She showed us good customer service and gave us a new waitress.

Jasmine C.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,2,1,1.0,10/19/2017,"This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to!!  So, first I will say I am a very picky eater which is why I don't like to eat out often, and when I do eat out, I always choose the the same restaurant and opt for the same meal. Boring I know, but It usually saves my tummy some disappointment; however, that was not the case this time.  I ordered the lunch size Pasta Di Vinci as usual because that's always my go to item on the menu and my favorite pasta! When it came out I was pretty disappointed because there were three tiny pieces of chicken on my entire plate! Three! Again, I don't eat out often, and I especially don't eat pasta often, but today I told myself I would, so when there was three damn pieces of chicken. I was pretty annoyed. I don't like to complain so I didn't say anything. I thought to myself, well, I did order the lunch special.. maybe that is why. So I ordered another one to go. Well, when I got home to open it, there was literally no sauce on there at all!!!!! I would have brought it back if it wasn't a 30 min drive!  On top of that, the waitress was really rude. My Husband still had food on his plate and a full beer when our waitress brought the bill which was pretty rude. She even had the nerve to come back and say ""I'm going to be leaving soon."" because we hadn't paid yet. Did it ever occur to her that we hadn't paid because we weren't done. She could've introduced us to the next waiter who would be taking over her section. That would be the professional thing to do   Overall, this place is garbage and I'm pretty disappointed because this has always been one of my favorite places to eat! Worst $90 I ever spent! Don't waste your time or money here. I wished I would've looked at the Yelp reviews before coming here.  I hope the management team does something about their terrible reviews!  Btw. The mashed potatoes here are garbage as well! Seems like they recycle them all week and just add milk to them each day to smooth them out.

This location brought my order out and it was heavy spice. It was so spicy that I couldn't breathe after i took a bite. They came over and took the food back and fixed the order. The manager came over to say how sorry he was.  That still didn't take away from the burning sensation in my mouth. They didn't even bother taking it off my bill either.

It wasnt anything special it lacked wine sauce as it was little so i had to ask my host to bring more & after she brought it the whole plate was great but not 5 star great more like 3 star , dynamite shrimp this time wasnt as good as i had order it before in different location , my favorite cheese cake is white chocolate macadamia cake its my always best option and it worth 5 stars, Service definitly worth 5 stars which made my rating to be 4 stars , i had other plates and for me burgers is what they only do good beside cake!

Jennica S.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",639,405,1367,5.0,4/4/2017,"Personally, The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants because they have amazing food, reasonable prices, great customer service, and the perfect ambiance. Happy hour, casual lunch or dinner, a birthday, whatever occasion it is--this restaurant is perfect! (Unless it's an extremely special occasion, of course, I go somewhere ""expensive."")  I've always wanted to go to this location because I like the area, so while at my stay at Embassy Suites, my boyfriend and I decided to go here for a few appetizers a few hours before our dinner reservations. We were confused because we went through the wrong entrance, so when we reached the table where the hosts were, we realized how long the line/busy the restaurant was. Luckily, we were able to grab a high top table within minutes because we just wanted to do appetizers, like I said. The sliders were good, but this segment is dedicated to the avocado egg rolls. THEY ARE THE REASON FOR MY EXISTENCE. I love avocado, but in egg roll form? The best. The sauce that they paired it with made it even better. I was honestly shocked at how good they were.  Our waitress was really sweet! She managed to check up on us often, and was not very overwhelming. The only issue I had was that there was a table with a drunk girl (I'm assuming because her head was on the table), and a worker stood guard at the bathroom door because she was in there. Also, a police officer had to escort another drunk gentleman out. So, the crowd can get a bit too rowdy at this specific location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3

Lindsay C.,"Santee, CA",136,21,35,1.0,9/17/2017,"Had an absolute horrible experience at dinner on Friday and now it's creating an even more terrible experience days after.  (Major ordering and delivery details removed to shorten review - will discuss with corporate regarding order delivery a spouse didn't receive food until 30+ minutes after we received ours) A woman named Lizette (who is now harassing and having her friends harass the customer - see attached photo) came by and put the plate of food down in front of my spouse. She then asked if everything was okay and my spouse promptly said no. She asked why and my spouse stated the party was half way done with their meal and he had just barely gotten his. Lizette then laughed at my spouse and with a passive aggressive tone her attitude changed and she asked if we wanted to speak to a manager. I stated no that we would just like to eat. When she began to redundantly repeat herself ""are you sure?"" Each time getting more and more sarcastic, turning her face and directly staring at me, ultimately tearing me like a child. Call it what you will, but I'm not oblivious or ignorant to aggressive demeanors. I sternly said no one final time and she stood there for roughly 3-5 seconds and just stared and me then walked away. It was enough for the other members of the group to be alarmed and mention something. Once she walked away, I then felt compelled to speak to someone about her attitude as I felt if I would have addressed her any further - confrontation would have occurred.  (My review was too long so I'll spare the dinner details for corporate( No one was pleased so we opted to get the manager. This is when the above agreements and information was relayed.  I personally brought up the issue regarding the food runner who had talked to us so rudely, the manager said she had left. When she was literally feet behind him running food. When we asked how we could complain about our service and this woman specifically - the manager told us we would need to contact corporate and complain against our server. Despite my complaint being against Lizette the food runner.  I took upon myself, since your management seems to be okay with this type of behavior, I took it upon myself to find Lizette and let her know she cost the table and server tip with her attitude. And immediately I was met with the same passive aggressiveness and a walk away.  Lizette, sweetheart.... we're taking this to corporate now that your friends are harassing honest reviewers AND paying customers. I told you passive aggressiveness gets you no where. Well neither does harassing. As for the manager, you stated it was your first day on the job. Advice - you have angry or upset customers... get them quickly out of your establishment in a respectful manner. You made us sit there for 38 additional minutes. We spent nearly 3 hours total at your establishment for a 1 hour dinner. Tops. You need more training apparently.  Calling corporate tomorrow morning - kept my receipt. Table 101 Server Edgar Q.

Waitress was professional and nice, always kept our drinks topped off. We ordered the Avocado Spring Rolls as our app, and it came out within 5 minutes of us ordering it (again pointing at how long it took us to be seated and yet food came out quick as heck). Wife ordered the Falafel salad and I ordered the Breakfast sandwich, both of which are over 1000 calories. My sandwich was good, nothing spectacular.

Outside patio seating is nice during the warm summer months. Cons: Worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. The hostess and waiting service were terrible. Food was not as good as other franchises, by far. I was highly disgusted by the tiny slice and stale taste of red velvet cheesecake. This is the only flavor I buy at every location. None have ever tasted bad like this one.  Management needs take serious action asap. Lots of tables were open. We had a good 20+ minutes wait before being seated. Another 20 minutes passed before a waitress offered us water! Another 10-15 minutes passed before water was brought and our orders were taken. After food came, we nearly forgot we had a waitress.

The kids menu was fabulous- extensive and had such a wide variety of options, I loved it!! My son tried the grilled salmon with carrots French fries and a lemonade! He was so happy and we were even happier to see he had a nutritious and tasty kids meal. My husband had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. The dish was presented beautifully but was pretty disappointing. The pasta was not in the least bit spicy and the Cajun flavors were coated heavily on the seafood only and not the pasta... My mom tried the Chicken Bellagio. It was good - crunchy chicken atop a bed of Basil linguine served with a generous portion of creamy sauce.  I tried the Hibachi Steak - it was cooked perfectly as requested, however the side of ""wasabi"" mashed potatoes had NOT the slightest hint of wasabi and was extremely under seasoned. The side of tempura asparagus was drenched in oil and left little pools of oil on my plate. We then proceeded to salvage this visit with some cheesecake.  We had the Hazelnut Crunch, Pecan Caramel Turtle and the Mango Key Lime cheesecakes, which were thankfully delicious.  I doubt we will be returning here unless it is solely to grab dessert.

Alexandra T.,"Fort Worth, TX",74,59,8,2.0,4/17/2017,"I had occasion to come here twice in one day. The first was for lunch: Dining in with friends, we'd all just landed in town and gotten checked in to our local hotels. I shared a falafel salad, which was okay. The service  was friendly and pretty quick. There were a couple of order mix-ups around me, but I didn't pay it too much attention, as we were told the runners were in training.  I was on the go all day, so when I was heading back to my hotel for the night, I figured I'd go for a sure thing and pick up my usual (Shrimp with Angel Hair) to take back to my room. I ordered at the counter, where I was told it would be ready in about 15 minutes.  15 minutes passes. Then 20. 25. It was busy, but by the time I realized more than half an hour had passed, I asked for an update. Turns out, my food had been placed on a shelf without anybody saying anything to me. I was assured it wasn't cold, but the young lady asked if I wanted​ them to make another. I had absolutely no desire to wait another 30 minutes (if I'd wanted to be there that long, I'd have dined in), so I took my food and left.  When I refer to this dish as ""my usual,"" I mean that I've been eating this at CF locations around the country for over a decade. Cold - which it absolutely was - is one thing. This was also undercooked (the noodles were not only underdone, but stuck together as if insufficiently stirred during preparation) AND bland. This is typically an entree that is so deliciously garlicky that you have to plan your day around it. I'm not even sure there was garlic in it at all.  So. The forgetfulness, I could have chalked up to them being busy. What's the excuse for the subpar food?

I was kinda full so only planned to order something small & a drink. My something small was a roasted cauliflower dish that was AWFUL! a ton of sauce, super salty and tasted more fried than roasted. In fact, there was so much on the vegetables that you couldn't even taste the cauliflower. After trying about 3-5 and having my cousin at the table try one to see that my tastebuds weren't off - I called the waiter and sent them back! I asked for a menu to order something else because they were awful and our server FROSTY obliged. Long story short when he brought me my bill at the end of the evening and told me he was charging me for the cauliflower because he had someone in the kitchen taste my food & it was made correctly - um WTH!?!

Mayra C.,"Murrieta, CA",68,3,,1.0,1/3/2018,"One star is OVERRATED for the horrible experience I had at this place! On Christmas Eve, my family and I, a party of 20, decided to go to your location after looking into a few restaurants in the area. Biggest mistake ever, we had a terrible night. When we arrived, we were told that the wait to dine inside was 2-3 hours compared to a 50 minute wait to dine on the patio. We had kids with us and wanted to have dinner before it got late as they wanted to go open their christmas presents. After an hour and a half wait, only half of our party was called in, we were told that the rest of us could go join them when our tables were ready in about 15 minutes. When the rest of us were called and guided towards our table, we realized that you sat the rest of our party inside. If we would have wanted to have dinner apart, we would have stayed home! The staff had no initiative to help with the organization of our tables, so I asked for the rest of my family to be brought outside. After the chaos, we sat and were unattended for about 10 minutes, our waitress came to get our order but we had not even been given the menus yet. To top it off, the warmer near us was not working, we were all freezing! We waited about an hour to be served, and not everyone was served their dinner, my brother in law never got his soup, and my son NEVER got his hamburger ( would have gotten it faster in a drive thru). My sisters pasta wasn't well done, it was tasteless and undercooked. Your patios should not be offered if your heating system is not working, we were all freezing to death! We decided to deal with everything because it was Christmas Eve, a special celebration, but we shouldn't have. The only person I cannot complain about is our waitress, she did her best to accommodate us.  If you can't deal with a party of 20, let people know, there are plenty of options in the area.

Nick M.,"El Cajon, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/18/2017,"IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS THANKS TO ERIKA EDWARDS (the shift ""Manager"") I WOULD!!! here's what happened: A party of 15 and I went to this specific location on 12/17/17 for a Secret Santa party. We were greeted and seated in the outdoor section of the location and one of our guests with us happened to be a part time worker with the cheesecake Factory (for another location in San Diego). After 15 or 20 minutes into our visit, the shift manager, Erika Edwards, pulled our friend who works for the company aside and proceeded to curse at her in a very unprofessional manner because she claimed that we were being ""too loud"". My entire group overheard the shift manager saying such verbiage to our friend Jucelle (the one who works for the company as well) and we did not appreciate the level of respect that was given to her whatsoever as we felt it was VERY unprofessional especially coming from a management standpoint. she was saying to Jucelle (about the rest of us) that ""they are being 'Fucking' ridiculous"" and she ""doesn't not give a 'Shit' who we are, she will kick us all out"". After hearing these comments (when she claimed that we were being too loud), many of the members of our party became disgusted and did not want to eat at the restaurant. I tried to diffuse the situation myself by getting everyone to stay and eat at the restaurant as it was late at night and it would be difficult to find a reservation elsewhere. Some of the members in our group asked Jucelle if she could speak to the other shift manager on duty. The gentleman showed up and listened to what we had to say, then Erika came back and began defending her case by saying that we were ""being loud"" once again. We explained to her politely that we were seated in an outdoor environment and it should be expected that our party might be a bit louder than others if you consider the fact that we are a party of 15 rather than 2. She then proceeded to claim that we were ""Harassing"" other guests. We all called her a liar for that because we asked a couple seated directly behind us (not even 3 feet away) if we harassed them in any way, the gentleman of the 2 simply smiled shook his head and replied, ""no you guys are fine"" in front of Erika as well. We asked politely if we could at least get an apology for the situation. We said we will try our best to satisfy Erika's needs and we were willing to comply to her accusations, but she refused to even apologize for her own actions towards our friend and kept blaming us for the situation. All in all, we chose to leave the restaurant after this terrible experience that was gifted to us by Erika, making her name to us all very memorable as none of us have ever been asked to leave a restaurant or have we never left a restaurant by own will after a souring turn of events. I am a manager myself and I can truly say the skills of Erika on handling this situation were very distasteful and are not of management quality. You should NEVER curse at an employee lower than yourself especially if she is on her time off and is a customer of the company at that point. If Erika had a problem with us from the beginning she should have addressed the issue by coming to all of us and asking us all politely to lower our voices if we were being of a disturbance at all. We would like some sort of action to be placed against Erika Edwards because her hospitality was not professional, and her words were definitely not up to par as well. We went out and carried our Secret Santa Party at another restaurant, and as a loyal Cheesecake Factory guest I will sadly say that I will never visit that location again after my experience at this specific location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=40

The whole point of going for your birthday is to get a Cheesecake and have the whole birthday experience right? Well first off my shrimp angel hair pasta had barely any sauce and it just tasted like bland noodles with some tomatoes on top. Even my friends order was missing the sauce on her meal and her chicken was dry. My other friend had to wait on his burger almost 30 mins after we all got our orders because apparently they forgot about his order and tried to lie about it. We were all almost done by the time he even got his and to make it worse the girl (whose name I originally left out but after her friend left me nasty messages on here I'll say it LIZETTE) brought out the plate just laughed about it which was completely rude and unprofessional. Then, my friends had told the waiter it was my birthday so we were all waiting for him to come back so we could put in our cheesecake orders but they never even asked us if we wanted Cheesecake but instead they come out with a little tiny glass filled with pudding and whipped cream on top. Now I have been to a Cheesecake many times before and they ALWAYS ask if we want Cheesecake according to their policy but they never even gave us the option. We told the manager who claimed that was normal but we have all had birthdays at different locations before and that's not normal. So if you're looking to go here for your birthday think twice.

James M.,"Lake Forest, CA",2,7,10,1.0,5/18/2017,"Staying at Embassy Suites across the street.  Ordered $60 worth of takeout for my fam, including Chicken & Shrimp Jambalaya on rice.   After walking back to my room, I discovered their so-called ""jambalaya"" didn't hardly have any sauce.  My rice shoulda been swimming in sauce, but it was just chicken, shrimp, & veggies cooked in sauce, then laid on top of rice without sauce.   Also, they didn't include any napkins, even tough I specifically asked.  Annoying b/c I gave her a tip even though it was takeout.  So I walked back there. They gave me some BS that their jambalaya isn't saucy.  My thought: then don't call it jambalaya.  They were nice enough to make some sauce, although I waited about another 15 min.  More drama than I wanted before eating my dinner.

I have dined at other Cheesecake Factory locations and never really had a problem. Saturday nights are busy. I get it. But our waitress rarely checked on us and I had to flag her down when we needed things. Twice for refilling our water glasses!  Our ceasar salad was a huge disappointment. It was a watery, wilted mess. It didn't even taste like ceasar salad. There was not one hint of parmesan on it. My daughter got 1 crouton in her salad. I got about 8. But gave her mine. I asked one of the servers (who came by to pick up dishes) if what we ordered was ceasar salad and she said, ""That's how it is.""  My nephew didn't have dinner, he came along just for the dessert. When we placed our order, I told the waitress to bring out his dessert when our food came out. Sure enough, he didn't get his dessert until we flagged the waitress down yet again. She did say she would bring the cake in 2 minutes but at that time we were already almost done with our dinner.  Seriously disappointed from that experience.

Food - didn't live up to expectations.  Under cooked rice, overcooked shrimp.  None of us (party of 5) finished the food.  We left in disgust to go back to Hilton Bayfront hotel restaurant and bars.

We went to this location because my sister-in-law and her kids were staying at the Embassy Suites across the street. I thought perhaps it was just a rough night for our server, but based on the previous reviews, I guess this location truly is awful. - Lighting (or lack thereof): I'm happy to live in an age where practically everyone has a cellphone. Definitely came in handy when perusing the menu. - Messed Up Food Orders: My MIL is picky and usually has some complaint, but this time her complaints were truly legit. Some veggies were missing from her salad and the extra bowl she requested (she was splitting it with my FIL) took FOREVER to get to the table. My SIL ordered some fish tacos. Upon inspection  (using her phone, of course), she found there was no avocado in them. A small container was brought out before her kids graduated college. *Whew* - Rice: My MIL ordered a dish that came with rice; I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya but subbed pasta with rice. I noticed the rice in my jambalaya was dry, hard, and sticky. It was like the yucky stuff from the bottom of the pot. I was somewhat OK with it because my dish had sauce. My MIL, however, complained that the rice was not fluffy like she had had at other locations. The server came back with an equally unappetizing clump of rice. He said all they have is sticky rice, but he could swap for brown rice, mashed potatoes or veggies. The manager came out and apologized. She comped 2 slices of cheesecake for my MIL and SIL.

The chicken enchiladas were not good as it has a red sauce that is the opposite of tasty.  I ended up getting sick from these enchiladas. However the most annoying experience from this awful decision to go to this cheesecake location was waiting 30 minutes to pay the bill.  We asked Theo for the check.  15 minutes later, another server gives it to us and splits.  I even had my credit card ready and he still split.  I tracked down another server to pay and he runs it.  Instead of bringing us back the check, he tries to track down Theo to return it to us.  Another 15 minutes goes by until Theo is found. When somebody starts to waste my time, I get mad.  Because I've been a server for 8 years, I conjured up enough sympathy to produce a tip.   I will never be back, and I would recommend Theo to receive more training.  Most restaurants require a table to be approached within one minute of being sat.  I understand it was a Saturday night, but to have passed us 5 times while being ignored, was not only annoying, but completely unprofessional.

The only good thing about this location is that it's near Seaport other than that it's all BAD! So came here after a great night of watching the San Diego Symphony at the embarcadero. Craving some cheesecake. So figured we should end the night by having dinner here.  First off, it was around 9:30pm and there was a pretty long wait. 20minutes for a Sunday night. Our buzzer went off and we rushed to the hostess. When we got there one of the hostess was on the phone and told us that now we have to wait to have our names called out. OK. Then when we were finally walked to what we thought would be our table, it was not clean. She preceded to tell us to walk back to the front to wait for the table to be cleaned. After waiting for a few minutes the same girl told us. Sorry but your table is now outside. We were confused, but so hungry so retreated and followed her to a very dark outside patio. Like so dark everyone who was looking at their menu had their phones out with the flashlight on. So needless to say no pictures were taken.  I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and Tim ordered the Chicken and Biscuit. The bread prior to the meal came 10 minutes after he took our order. Then the food came like 20 minutes after that. My pasta was cold and bland. Seriously lacking in flavor. It's like someone dump pasta in a bowl and added some shrimp and chicken and ""sauce"" that was made for 1/3 of that pasta. It was dry. And Tim's Chicken and Biscuit was lackluster. Chicken was ok. But the biscuit and mashed potatoes was also extremely bland.  So to say that we were unsatisfied is an understatement. I only had a few bites of my food before we had to wave for another server since ours seems to be MIA to ask her for our check. Tim was going to pay cash and she said she couldn't take the payment because it's not her table. But she could if he was paying with a card. So he did since we did not want to stay a minute longer. It was a ridiculous wait after wait for food that was not good at all.  We both have dined at other Cheesecake locations and we can both say we would never come back to this one again.

Mikey H.,"San Diego, CA",352,821,2768,4.0,1/10/2016,"Met a high school friend, who I haven't seen in like a gazillion years, here.  I was not sure what kind of food she liked or what kind of ambiance and I figured, large menu choices and there's always something for someone.  She was actually excited because she likes CCF.  I can't say it was a friendly greeting when I walked in, only because a former student of mine was one of the hostesses...so I naturally became one of those rude and demanding customers just to give her a hard time....in front of other workers as well...LOL!  I was actually hoping she was serving so we could sit in her section and really give her a hard time...yeah, that's how I roll with former students...LOL! We took a table out on the patio.  Granted it was in mid December but the sun was out and they had heaters since we were in the shade.  Friendly greeting from our server who told us to take our time.  He was very patient as he came back a couple of times and we only ordered drinks.  Catching up with friends usually does that.   Jules ordered the Skinnylicious tacos which looked really good and came with a side of steamed or sauteed veggies, I couldn't tell.  I thought it was funny that she didn't eat them.  I ordered one of my favorites, the Cajun Jambalaya pasta which was perfect on a slightly chilly winter day.  What I like about CCF is that they are consistent with whatever you order at any location.  I also like the Chicken Madeira, which I always ask for extra sauce for my potatoes.   We were extra good today and didn't order cheesecake.  Trying to cut back on sugar!  But when I do indulge, I usually get the lemon raspberry cheesecake.  I feel like I'm not being so decadent.  Again, our server was friendly without being intrusive and let us take our time.  My only complaint would be the screaming child.  Dang, take that kid to the car and crack the window...LOL...just kidding, but you were thinking it.  This is a great place for families and out of towners.  I would definitely come back by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=80

I love their Skinnylicious menu it was perfect for late nights low calories So I ordered the fresh beet with goat cheese (with baby arugula pecan and vinaigrette it was fresh and perfection. And a small plate of Skinnylicious salmon rolls. Must have! It's spiced fresh salmon rolled in spinach fried in crisp wrapper. It was delish and I wanted more. But wore my tight pants I can't overeat lol! It was all 590 cal or less what a perfect portion. Hubby ordered the super antioxidant salad. It's a healthy delish salad blend of salad greens spinach kale avocado broccoli grapes and roasted pear. It's obviously a super power food. He also ordered an entree which is a steak Diane and salmon served with mashed potato & veggies. this combination is hell yeah ! It was Bombilicious!  Daughter ordered the burger with bacon it was a huge portion regular menu a glam burger served with fries they used certified angus beef. Heavenly deliciousness she said tender and juicy medium well.

It was too pretty to eat it and deliciously topped with mango mousse on a vanilla coconut macaron crust ! Yum ! I'm drooling right now ! It was paired with a black coffee. Hmmmm ;)  Overall it was a delightful dinner on a fridaylicious night. CS was very friendly our waiter was very attentive. Modern Ambience, good vibes good music and dim lights. Relaxing atmosphere. They have a nutrition menu if you're super conscious and watching calories. Very good menu over 250 dishes made fresh with quality ingredients. You won't feel guilty!  Yummy!!! This location is at the headquarters in Seaport village they will validate your parking ticket and I think you only pay $3 or $4 for the first 2 hrs.  I can't wait to come back here again.

He was absolutely amazing; great funny personality, attentive and had good energy! It was pretty busy as it was Saturday afternoon but we go in quickly and we were able to sit out side and people watch.  We ordered the pear, blue cheese and caramel iced onion flatbread. It was tasty but not that big, if you're there with a bunch of people you'd need 2. We also had the Southwestern salad, it was by far the largest pile of salad I've seen. It has two tostadas on the bottom so that you can just pick it up and put it all on your plate. It wasn't mediocre at best.. And one of the cats from our group had the rib eye. It must have been good cause it was all gone! All in all its a great place to come check out and enjoy the bay.

Shaun F.,"Glendora, CA",30,57,7,2.0,7/24/2017,"I feel sorry for the wait staff at this restaurant. This location is seriously understaffed and thus each waiter/waitress has to cover way too many tables and booths. My waiter today had a particularly hard time today after being seated with 3 large groups plus my row of booths. Needless to say, the service was horrible but that was not the waiter's fault. He tried his best but there was way too much work for one person. The fault lies with management and the hostess for giving him such terrible assignments. When a restaurant tries to cut costs by cutting staffing it is always the customer service that suffers.

Alyssa M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,5,4,3.0,9/3/2017,"So my experience here a few weeks ago was very good up until the end. I had been waiting to see if anyone else would write about this issue but nobody has so maybe it just happened to me and my boyfriend. So while we were there the food and service was excellent, this is our favorite restaurant and we've never been disappointed. Even after this incident we would come back but we were put in a very uncomfortable position by our server. When we received the bill the area towards the bottom where it indicated the tip percentage was marked with a heart. Now I work in a restaurant and I have for the past 5 years so I completely understand how important tipping is, it's what most servers live off of, so I could see why she may of done it but I'd still never do that. So we gave her the card and when she came back the next copy of the bill was marked in the same spot but this time boxed. I felt so uncomfortable and so judged because I assume she did this due to our age, and she thought we didn't know how important tipping was. It really made me upset and we were already planning tipping 20% but after that we left her still 15%, in my opinion after really thinking about this she may of deserved 5% for jumping to wrong conclusions. I thought I'd share just in case other people my age have had to deal with this at this restaurant or even by this server so they know they're not alone in feeling uncomfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=80

Noel I.,"San Diego, CA",222,205,213,1.0,7/30/2016,"I've have eaten at Cheesecake Factory for many years. I've never eaten at this location and wanted to try it. This location is very popular being in the hotel and shopping district of Seaport Village nestled in Downtown San Diego and along San Diego bay. Next door is the Hyatt and Marriott hotels with the Gaslamp Quarter just beyond that. This complex was built on an abandoned Police station and jail. The restaurant's decor is beautiful and reminds me of the main dining halls of the classic cruise ships. Beautiful place.  Now on to my experience.... This place is busy! The hostesses handled the very busy job of turning and seating tables down to s science. The wait staff was much to be expected...The food was good but when the service doesn't match your environment, then you are not getting the full picture. We started off with the MEATBALLS, RICOTTA AND GARLIC CHEESE BREAD...this was absolutely amazing and a meal in itself. We also had FRIED MACARONI AND CHEESE, these I will not order ever again. The coating taste like it was burnt and the Mac and cheese inside had no flavor. My entree was the CHICKEN DI PANA which I later realized wasn't. Our waiter gave me a Chicken Piccata instead. I had no idea that she gave me the wrong entree until writing this review. According to the online menu, Chicken Di Pana came with Broccoli and Mashed Potatoes. I got chicken with mushrooms, lemon, capers and a side of pasta. Not realizing that I was eating chicken piccata, I said to my spouse, ""this taste like chicken piccata."" So BOO on our waitress for bringing me something that I didn't order. My spouse had the CHICKEN MADEIRA. He said it was ok. The portions are huge and the prices are a bit on the higher end.

Manager came out, we hadn't said anything and provided whole table cheesecake. The manager here IS NOT customer friendly. Haven't even started to begin about the other issue we had at the table.

Especially the froo-froo ones. This is pretty much the only place I go to that I order cocktails. This probably since they don't have any decent beer options, which is ok cause I don't feel like this place is a beer type of place.

While in San Diego (near the Harbor across from the Hyatt), I called to order the lunch size salad (due restrictions) during the dinner hours. At first I was transferred from the front desk to the take out desk, then put on hold for a manger for over 6 minutes. After explaining to the manager my restrictions he honored my request. Everything is good....I received my order walked back to my room to open my salad to find out there was no chicken. Who fixes a Santa Fe Chicken Salad with no chicken. At first I was going to let it go, but I couldn't. I called back to the restaurant and talked to the manager. He was very apologetic and offered to make me another salad; I declined because I was too tired to walk back and get the replacement salad. The next day I realized my flight left later in the afternoon so I called back to the restaurant and talk to the manager on duty explained what happened the night before and asked could I pick up a replacement salad for lunch, the manager again was apologetic for what had happened the night before and honored my request. When I got to the restaurant my salad was waiting, the cashier verified with me that there was chicken on my salad and sent me on my merry way. Thank you to both managers ( I didn't get their names) for being accommodating. I guess the only thing that would have made this a five star review if they would have thrown in a piece of cheesecake. All in all I was a satisfied customer and my salad was delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=120
Glaser M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3,14,,2.0,5/18/2017,"Our server was very sweet and seemed genuine. Then I noticed everyone who came out after us getting their food... apparently the ""system went down when our server put in our order"" which really means she pocketed our ticket and never put it in... we waited 45 mins for our food. Manager did not care whatsoever! I couldn't believe how little she cared about our experience. I was never offered anything to fix the issue. The manager just gave me some half assed apology which I could tell she didn't even want to do. Manager Ashley needs to get some serious training on how to handle different situations.

Lauren G.,"Temecula, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/12/2017,"Typically, going to The Cheesecake Factory is enjoyable. The food is usually good and the service is as well. This afternoon, we got seated shortly after arriving since it was not at all busy. Our waitress was kind and brought us our first round of sodas and waters quickly. She said the bread will come out shortly. We ordered an appetizer, the summer spring rolls, which came out unappealing. They were loosely wrapped and sloppily presented. We ordered our entrees- buffalo wings, avocado toast, and teriyaki chicken. The bread finally came out 35 minutes later. The avocado toast and buffalo wings came out 30 minutes post ordering. However, the teriyaki chicken came out one hour after ordering. Instead of our waitress apologizing for the wait, she said, ""saved the best for last."" Ironically, the teriyaki chicken was lukewarm and had a consistency of gelatinous fat. We immediately asked for boxes, as we had already been at the restaurant for an hour and 45 minutes. We hoped our waitress would ask how to food was, since that's usually wait staff protocol. She didn't. She brought us boxes and our bill. 20 minutes passed and she hadn't returned. We brought the bill to the hostess and asked for the manager. Instead of comping at least the teriyaki chicken, she replied with, ""must just be a lackadaisical Saturday."" The weekends are the busiest days for restaurants, especially in a high tourist spot such as Seaport Village.

A few must tries: fried Mac and cheese balls! Bomb! Stuffed mushrooms are quite Delish! The Thai let us wraps are absolutely to die for! Things to steer clear of: Shepherds pie was bland and overpriced for a helping of potatoes. The nachos... Those were just down right not good! No flavor and nothing that stands out at all! A great idea is to call in a pick up order because they are normally pretty busy. They don't take payments over the phone which is honestly a good thing.  Julie(I think her name was... If not I'm sorry) was absolutely amazing! She helped me pick the perfect meal for the office team and was overly ready to make my day a good one with a single interaction!

Sarah E.,"San Marcos, CA",236,15,74,2.0,1/18/2016,"First time at this location and a last. Service: it was okay... The only great part was how quickly we were seated (party of 5), how quickly the food arrived, and that the server came by often to check-up on us during our meal. Keep in mind it was a Monday night and they weren't too busy. Probably had 3 different servers throughout our dinner. They forgot our appetizer... And when did they stop giving complimentary bread before the meal?! We saw other tables around us either being served with it or without it. Major downgrade not serving free bread to EVERYONE, who doesn't like the free bread at cheesecake?! Cleanliness: very poor for a Cheesecake Factory. Our booth smelled like used dirty rags. Utensils were all placed on top of this rag-smelling table with finger prints on them. I always thought they wrap them in clean napkins? Oh, and I can't forget the appetizer plates that had food stains, I could literally scratch that stuff off! It was so disgusting, so glad I didn't use those plates. Very low lighting and dim that anyone might overlook the lack of clean plates and utensils. The ladies bathroom was okay. Went twice and both times, they didn't refill their paper towels (I prefer the air dryer but it's something I noticed). The floor was wet too. Food: the grilled chicken avocado tasted good according to my sister, but a bit messy due to the small pieces of lettuce falling out. My chicken Caesar salad was delicious besides the croutons being a bit stale. My parents enjoyed their salads but unfortunately forgot the names of the meals. My brother ordered a ribeye steak that was overcooked. Don't bother mentioning it's your birthday because they WILL CHARGE YOU for your birthday cheesecake. The Oreo cheesecake was room temperature and the Oreos were stale. Total bummer!!  Pros:  - Server came by often to check-up on us, she was nice  - Got seated right away for a party of 5 (on a Monday night)  - Strawberry lemonade was DELISH as always  Cons: - DIRTY - charged for birthday cheesecake  - not completely satisfied with our meals  - forgot appetizer  - no complimentary bread",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=120

The service could use some work. They should really take the suggestion to use open table for people that like to plan ahead. Those who just walk in with no plans can wait. The Cheesecake Factory does not take reservation so you almost always have to wait at this location even if you plan ahead. The hostesses need to learn how to estimate time better. I get there and they quote 20 minutes which I thought was reasonable. It was more like 45+ minutes and this happens every time I go to the harbor location.

I wrote a wonderful review on this location before but after my last visit, a few days ago my opinion has changed.  To start off my brother ordered a Cuban Sandwich and apparently they were sold out. We did let the manager know but all he said was ""sorry its very popular and it takes a long time to prep"". This was the 3rd time that's happened. The waitress was nice but wasn't attentive.  When the food came out the lettuce that came with my boyfriends burrito was old, you could tell due to the discoloration. The spicy chicken sandwich was too fried it was burnt, I peeled it off and only ate half. i didn't complain because the first response that the manager gave me was enough to make me believe that he wouldn't be able to do anything for us.  MY BOYFRIEND AND I COME TO Cheesecake Factory AT LEAST 7 TIMES A MONTH FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. we go here or to the Fashion Valley location.  I would expect this from the Fashion Valley Locations because they are always packed and always busy.

A couple minutes after, a waiter came to our table and told us we had to move and that there was another party coming to sit there soon. Confused, we got up and put our names in again.  I went outside (keep in mind that it's about 90°) and waited to be called. I just so happened to see Tyler Posey (from MTV's Teen Wolf) walk into the restaurant. Pretty cool! About twenty minutes later we were seated on the outside patio, in the direct sunlight. I felt like I was literally burning, considering the table is metal. After about fifteen minutes, we still weren't taken care of by a waiter or waitress. At that point, someone from my party went to the management and explained the problem. But the worker just brought out a random waiter to take our drink orders.  We got our drinks a few minutes later, but by a completely different waiter, or should I say waitress. She seemed a bit frazzled because of the hectic nature of the restaurant, but was professional and helpful. She even got an extra umbrella for our table.

David R.,"San Diego, CA",1,10,10,1.0,3/6/2016,"Have always been a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory - have been to roughly 15 of them!  Tonight was the first time I was disappointed - which then led to frustration/anger/laughter after front desk and then manager Joshua Shurmet completely failed on the service level.  Ordered with Door Dash (have done this before) food arrived within 45 minutes, nice and warm.  I ordered extra cashews in the spicy cashew chicken (one of my guilty pleasures).  Unfortunately when opened there were only 7-10 cashews (being generous on my count).  Confirmed receipt had extra cashews.  Then opened my avocado egg rolls only to see 4 of the 6 were brown/grey on avocado.   I called the store, told the hostess - she did not even say ""so sorry"" or anything, instead ""K"" and then put me on hold. What is wrong with this cheesecake factory I thought? Well, the answer picked up roughly 7 minutes after being put on hold. The problem - Joshua Shurmet.   Please sit down for this because you may fall over when you read what Joshua said about the low count of cashews: ""Maybe the delivery company ate them"".  Seriously. No it gets better, after highlighting how ridiculous this response was - it was like he doubled down and nearly insisted the delivery company ate my extra cashews - there was no way, just not possible that the cook didn't put the extra cashews in the dish.  I thought this guy was so hilarious I HAVE to get him on my radio show (Every Tuesdays at 7pm).  Unfortunately, Joshua refused.  I didn't want to further discuss the brown/grey avocado's in the rolls, he would have probably said the driver must have spray painted them or something.

Today however I went in with a friend during our lunch break. We stayed this to our server she replied with no worries. We sat down placed our order 20 minutes later we received our meal grilled pork chops and a pizza salad lunch combo. The food was brought out all except the salad that goes with my pizza. I asked them for it and was told it would be right up and it wasn't. I waited and ate my pizza my coworker was having trouble eating her very dry pork chop so she spoke to waiter who then produced his manager Gabriella Uribe who after trying to makeup for the lackluster food with a slice of cheesecake, then offered to remake the food which we had no time for. So after a lengthy passive aggressive lecture she agreed to discount the chops. She left to what we thought was to rectify the bill and never returned. During the wait I'm attempting to get the attention of a server or team member but they were all congregating by the main entrance talking and laughing. I see a member walk away and say excuse and raised my hand to gesture to him but he walked by nose up in the air ignoring me. So I said excuse me loudly and he turns to look at me with a look of disgust and anger as he walks towards me I can see the rage on his face. I ask can I have a to go box please. He stares me down and walks away. He returns and says you didn't have to yell. I said no one was paying attention to me so I had to speak up to get someone's attention since I had not seen my server in quite some time. Mind you I have no salad still. So the guy is still being confrontational and when I ask to speak to the manager he says to me ""I am the manager"". I say you find your behavior to be that of a manager? He replies you didn't have to yell! Seriously! Seriously! If I'm being ignored and am on a time crunch should I inconvenience myself and walk to you to get a box??? Am I in a fast food grease trap???

Meiko H.,"San Diego, CA",305,292,278,5.0,8/25/2015,"This is a 2 visit review because I just realized I never finished my review I started a year ago. DOH!  1. For kiddo's Birthday Month last year, her godmom and I took her to lunch and it was delish! We ordered a couple of small plates - Crispy Cuban Rolls and Loaded Baked Potato Tots. Both were great, especially the Cuban Rolls. It was like a Cubano sandwich in an egg roll wrapper. I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich, kiddo ordered the Buffalo Burger and godmom ordered the fish tacos.  I don't remember anything being bad so let's just say everything was really good and we had some good laughs and quality time together which was even better. 2. The 3 of us were supposed to come back together on the anniversary but godmom couldn't make it so it was just lil' mama and myself which is always fine by me! It looked pretty crowded when we got there but fortunately the wait was only about 10-15 minutes. Our server Michelle was great and helped me decide on an entree - Chicken Bellagio. I had told my daughter how I used to get the grilled pork chop a lot and she opted for that. We asked for our comp brown bread w/butter and we were happy campers until the food arrived shortly after. Daughter's chop was cooked perfectly w/mashed potatoes, green beans and applesauce to accompany it. I used to love taking a bite of chop and then a bite of applesauce but when my kid tried it, she almost gagged! Haha, she wasn't expecting something about the texture of the apples and warm applesauce flavor so let's just say she didn't love that part as much as I do! Other than that, her meal was on point. My chicken was 2 crispy cutlets served on top of basil cream pasta with prosciutto/arugula salad on top. It was really good and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  For dessert, she got the Salted Caramel cheesecake and I got the Chocolate chip coconut cheesecake(Chris's Outrageous, I think it's called). Either way, they were both scrumptious. We took our leftovers home to devour the next day. Well, kiddo ate the rest of her cheesecake that night but I'm still working on mine. She hasn't learned the art of savoring foods yet.

Dee M.,"Vista, CA",669,814,2965,4.0,2/14/2014,"Cheesecake Factory strikes again! I love the new location located at Seaport Village. Its tucked away in quaint mini outside shopping center that shares space with the likes of Puesto, a Mexican eatery, Seasons 52, and Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse.   This is another great date night location. My description of this charming San Diego gem would be 'intimate with a small town village vibe'. Parking is convenient and plentiful...as long as you're good with paying $5 when you let Cheesecake Factory validate your ticket. Not a bad deal IMHO. Just pay the $5 and be done with it folks. There are also meters just in front of Vic & Anthonys at the courtyard entrance to the Cheesecake Factory. Meters run all day at cost; they are $1.50 per hour with a two hour max:( There is a public lot just across from the meters before entering Seaport Village. The public lot is free after 6pm.  I'm a professed shopaholic, so the fact that I could burn through some cash at Lolo's Calisto's and then proceed just a few doors down to buy beach attire for my upcoming vacation...AWESOME!!!  Like most people, I give Starbucks a monthly allotment. So, it's nice to have a Starbucks location straddled amongst all the eateries. It's just perfect for that after dinner pick me up.  Dessert at Cheesecake Factory is always a treat, but, when you're in the mood for something sweet, but on the lighter side. Not to worry, head out of Cheesecake factory and grab yourself some gelato in the courtyard.  We arrived for dinner and were seated promptly. This blew us away. Never thought I'd see that happen at a Cheesecake Factory. Service was wonderful. Our server was very friendly and attentive.  My pineapple mojito was wonderful as usual. This is a great drink if you look sweeter cocktails. The food was also delicious. We ordered the loaded baked potato tots as an appetizer. Oh boy were these good.

I enjoyed the Cobb salad ok.  There was nothing wrong with it, and it was a generous portion for sure... while it was nice to try something different, I wouldn't order it again since it wasn't spectacular.  I'd definitely suggest the beet/goat cheese salad any day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=180
Laura W.,"Olympia, WA",0,8,,1.0,4/10/2016,VERY DISAPPOINTED. Not what I expected from a Cheesecake Factory. Our waiter was very nice and doing the best he could under the circumstances. Getting our food was SLOW. Keep in mind it was about 2:00 on a Friday afternoon and they were not busy. To compensate our waiter kept bringing out more bread. You can only eat so much bread. We wanted our food. When I asked when our food was coming the manager came over and was VERY RUDE. Our whole party was very taken aback by it. My salad was TERRIBLE and honestly kind of gross looking. Wet wilted lettuce and MISSING KEY INGREDIENTS.  We were planning on ordering desert but skipped it because we all couldn't wait to get out of there and try and forget the whole experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=180
Cl S.,"San Diego, CA",16,37,2,3.0,6/5/2017,No line. Now I know why. Filet Mignon was medium rare and perfect. Green beans were cooked just right but so loaded with black pepper that I could only eat 2 bites. Ate about half of the mashed potatoes because that was all of the salt that I could handle. Danielle was efficient and friendly but please don't interrupt conversations in mid sentence. Turn down the music a bit to facilitate conversation. Pass on this location.

Julie K.,"Santee, CA",107,6,7,2.0,7/31/2016,"I normally do not post reviews but in this case I have to. We went to the Seaport Location for the first time last night and the service and food were not very good.  I ordered the fried zucchini as I always do. When they came to the table they were cold and thin like fries. Nothing like they are normally made at every other Cheescake Factory I have ever been to.  The biggest pet peve I have is if a server does not clear the dirty appetizer dishes before the main meal dishes are served. Sure enough...the dinner came out and was plopped on a table full of dirty dishes! To make it worse, our server walked away without taking them! What? He had to make room between the dirty dishes to put the meal dishes down! Then a female server brought my husbands plate and said ""oh let me clear these dirty dishes"". She wasnt even our server and noticed that the table was full of dishes that needed to be cleared.   I ordered the Tuscan Chicken dish that I love, with extra farro and easy tomatoes. When the dish came it was cold and the tomatoes still looked like then were not cooked. There was barely a full tablespoon of farro! Then the waiter came and handed me a basil sauce that is normally already on the dish to add to my dish! What! When I asked him for more farro he seemed annoyed! I ordered it that way, why was he getting annoyed?  It took so long for the farro to be broght to me that i asked for a box to take the whole meal home as it was Ice cold by now. Ugh. When we asked for more hot water for our hot tea, the server grunted! Why? We are having a dinner out and wanted to enjoy the evening! To have such terrible service and food was so disapointing from a restaurant that we normally know will be amazing!

Andrew L.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",258,133,23,2.0,2/12/2016,"This location is ALWAYS busy. With that said, prepare to wait and then wait some more for food. Everything about this cheesecake factory is the same mediocre chain restaurant you'll find in another city and I have been fine with that up until my visit last night. My party of 3 sat in the bar area with a pleasant, but slow server. Seems like a theme here... 15 minutes after sitting down, we get menus. side note- Though my $12 Sangria was delicious, it was definitely 70% fruit juice. Thats an expensive glass of fruit juice.  My friend ordered a chinese chicken salad (normally great) which came out within 15 minutes of ordering. After waiting a few minutes with the other food not anywhere in sight, she gave into temptation and started on her salad without us. 10 more minutes pass by and the server awkwardly says that her salad is for the next table over. I look over at the family next to us and the entire family is enjoying their meal... except for the mother. Whoops.. guilt trip. The server explains that my friend was eating a skinny salad instead and that her normal chinese chicken salad would be out soon.  15 minutes pass and  YAY! my Thai lettuce wraps have arrived. Again, my two friends entrees are nowhere in sight for another 15 minutes. The server notices and does a mini-freak out behind the kitchen (we could see from our high top table) and wah-lah.. magic! The other two entrees come out another 15 minutes later. By this time, I was done with my lettuce wraps and my mini shrimp tempura plate, my friend with the salad was already full from the other half salad she ate by accident, and my other friend was pissed because they forgot about the meal. If you did math from the numbers above, the meal was over an hour and a half. Now that would've been fine if I was actually enjoying the time there, but in all seriousness I couldn't wait to walk across the street back to my apartment. I think a to-go order would've been a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=160
Brad B.,"San Diego, CA",4916,964,1518,3.0,9/9/2015,"Yeah, three stars sums up this location pretty well as my experience here was ""A-OK,"" nothing less, nothing more.  Seeing that I was dragged here for a little work meeting I can't complain too much, but the major bummer comes in the form of some less than stellar service. The life has been sucked from the staff and their unhappiness is served to the customer with every slice of the Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple cheesecake. Can you imagine having to suggest that countless times throughout the day? Oh boy. I actually opted for the grilled chicken tostada salad even though my dad bod has officially made it through bathing suit season - healthy options, bro! I must say, it was an interesting choice, which is odd because this salad was described to be piled high with everything I like. Something was off though... what can it be? The cooks mistook parsley for cilantro! Weird, weird, weird, but I was hungry, hungry, hungry and in a hurry, hurry, hurry. Terrible? No. More than interesting... in a bad way? Yes.  My final gripe is the check being dropped before we were done eating and then realizing that it wasn't even our check. It was actually another table's closed out credit card awaiting signature.

Robert Z.,"WARNER SPGS, CA",149,359,3423,2.0,5/16/2016,"05/15/2016 Our family of six visited this Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch after attending a graduation ceremony on the USS Midway.   First off we have eaton at many Cheesecake Factories here in California.  All were 4 Star Plus for Food, Quality, and Service. Sadly This Place DOSN'T fit that description.  Our family all voted this Factory A Generous 1 1/2 To 2 Star Rating.   First the service. Even though our server was nice and polite she kept disappearing without bringing what we asked for.  One of us ordered a salad and never got her salad dressing till everyone else had Finished there meals.   Now The Food. I ordered the Bacon Bacon Burger. I have ordered it an other locations and loved it.  Sadly this time the quality was an extreme letdown. The Strip Bacon was just barely OK but the Pork Belly was so over cooked it was dry and hard like beef jerky and only two tiny chips of it. Very Very Disappointing.  It's a great burger a other locations. The salad were just ok.  The shrimp tacos were not to bad off the skinny menu.  Nothing to write back to Mexico about. The French Toast was good and tasty but it's a small order. The Best Thing We Had was The Chocolate Milk Shake.  Tasty. We did stop at the Cheesecake Counter to get some to go home. I'm sorry to say the girl behind the counter was extremely rude to all the customers and acted like we were bothering her by ordering some cake.  She stead to my wife,  ""So What Do You Want""  and not in a nice way.   The only good thing was the Cheesecake was Fantastic as usual. I've written over 200 yelp restaurant reviews.  This is one of the saddest ones I've Hade to write.  We Will Never dine here again nor will any of my Yelp Followers.    I Hope Corporate Management Reads This and Has A Word with This Particular Store.

Harley G.,"San Diego, CA",0,135,26,2.0,7/23/2016,"Unfortunately, this was one Cheesecake Factory location which needs help on a number of aspects to their operations. For one, sat outside in the later part of the evening around 8pm and the patio was dark. They don't offer above lighting, but you may get lucky with near by lighting on the sidewalk or around the business. They offer a candle at the table, but the cup it's in is dark brown or black therefore, the brightness won't fully display. Expect to be in the dark and to not be able to see your guests or menu. Used my iPhone light...had too.  Upon sitting down, our server came within minutes and provided us with drinks. Once order was placed, the server advised bread was baking in oven. Order arrived of BBQ salad and spaghettini and meat balls. Salad tasted watery. As if, it was drenched in water, not wiped down and just served. Not cool.  The taste of the salad was ruined even though it also had avocado, corn and black beans. I couldn't believe such a salad would be served.  Server was advised and supervisor came over to talk over the salad.  Advised server for plates, salad dressing and side of onion strips which were originally ordered. The supervisor didn't understand what watered down meant so had to explain in different terms, but he offered to make a new salad. At this point, there was no point as my meal was half completed.  The spaghetti and meatballs were okay. There wasn't much taste to meal. Dish only also included 3 meatballs. There was tomato sauce surrounding it,  but sauce didn't provide any further flavor. While almost done with our meal, the sever never did offer bread. Had to ask the server after flagging her down as she seemed more focused on a larger group over us, but she did eventually bring us what we originally asked for in our order. In the end, the bread never came, didn't finish the salad as I became disgusted with it and was disappointed in the overall experience. The salad was $13 and the spaghettini and meatballs $16. Not worth the price, experience, lack of quality or sitting in the dark on a patio. Their salads are as much in price as their entrees. They do however get stars for getting me in earlier than they said on the wait time, from 50 minutes to 30 minutes and for their supervisor who came over and listened about the salad issue thus, offered to bring out a new one. In my opinion, they need help on service, quality of food preparation and taste and customer service along with recognizing customer needs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=160

I don't recommend coming here... this is why : I came with a party of 10people on a Thursday night Checked in at 7:30. We didn't get seated till 10pm. (Had to stay because we were there for a bday). Upon my ordering I was disappointed to find out that the one thing on the menu I have ordered for years was off the menu.... the birthday girl also had her entree removed from the menu.. what the server recommended was NOT anywhere near what  I wanted... we had to rush our dinner because the place closes at 11... finally I asked the server if he could ring me out first since I needed to leave sooner than anyone else., he then proceeds to ask everyone if they too would like separate checks and I'm stuck waiting around for another 20min while he is giving 10people separate checks and boxes to go! At this point my baby was fussy and crying and I rushed out of there forgetting to validate my car and ended up paying $35 for parking which happened to be more than my meal.

I don't care what your system generated seating strategy tells you, but when customers request a table and it's available, you give it  to them. So of course those 6 tables were filled up 15 minutes after we were seated. We then had the good luck of a server that looked like she just hated her job. No smile, no nothing. Rude and took forever just to bring the drinks. She was then replaced by another server who was OK.

As a rule, if you want a booth or table you'll need to put your name on the list and wait, typically 30-45 minutes or more. Don't believe what the gals at the front tell you, if they say 15-20 minutes, it's a LIE.  But, if you're willing to take a chance and need to eat almost immediately, grab an open stool table near the bar (or sit at the counter). You'll also get to watch the game on the big screens above the bartenders. This will usually work for groups of 4 or less.  Service is typically friendly, quick and efficient.

Natalie T.,"Ann Arbor, MI",300,90,744,4.0,6/7/2015,"I'm not ashamed.  I will always have a special place in my heart for the Cheesecake Factory.  We visited this place twice while in San Diego on vacation.  I know what you're thinking...when you're on vacation, why would you go someplace that you have back in your city?  And the answer is that sometimes, you just have to go with what you know.  You know what to expect, you know they have options, and you know that you'll enjoy it. We started out saying we'd only try placing that were unique to San Diego and that we didn't have in Michigan and we started out the first part of our trip that way but then my eating companions got really turned off from a place the staff at our hotel suggested.  We asked around about some other well-known, really good spots in San Diego and tried those as well.  They were okay but nothing to write home about.  And so, we ended up at the good ole' Cheesecake Factory, which has never disappointed me. This location set-up is like the typical Cheesecake Factory.  They had a nice outdoor area in the front of the restaurant as well.  The menu is so large.  They pretty much have anything you could possibly want.  Some may find this overwhelming and intimidating.  Like my eating companion complained that the menu was too large.  I love options though so you won't hear me complain.  It does take me quite a while to determine what I want though because I have to determine what I'm in the mood for. We actually ate here twice in one day :-)  It was that good.  For lunch, I had the grilled chicken BLT with avocado and a side of fries.  It was so good and they give you nice portion sizes.  I also asked for my bread to be switched to another type because I didn't want the regular white bread the sandwich comes on and it was really tasty!  I got honey mustard and BBQ sauce on the side for dipping, which made it taste even better.  (I'm definitely a sauce girl!)  When I came back for dinner, I got the fried shrimp basket with fries and a side salad.  The shrimp were a really good size and fried perfectly to a crisp, golden brown.  The side salad was a really good addition as well because I felt like I was lacking in the greens and live veggie department while on vacation.  It made me feel a little less guilty about scarfing down another set of french fries that day.  They give you a nice bread basket that comes with a few varieties of bread and butter.  And for dessert, I had some of my friend's chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate chips on top and whipped cream on the side.  I'm not a huge chocolate on chocolate fan but it was pretty good, I must admit. Our service during lunch was excellent.  Our dinner service left something to be desired.  Our waiter was not good at all.  I understand they were a lot busier at night but he could've done a lot better.  Even still, it doesn't subtract from the love I have for The Cheesecake Factory.  It will always hold a special place in my heart.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=160

Justin K.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/29/2016,"Don't waste your time here. The only good thing about this place is leaving when you're done. I've been a huge cheesecake factory lover all my life. I've visited the Fashion Valley, Chula Vista and various- out of San Diego- locations on multiple occasions: to each I have zero complaints about. However, my visit to the Downtown/Seaport Village location was probably the worst experience I've ever had while dinning out, ever. Seriously.. Ever. I'd have gotten better service from a local Wendy's.. Probably better food too. To start, when we were seated, our ""Silverware"" wrapped in napkins only had butter knives. No seriously, just butter knives. Zero problem for smothering butter on our bread or opening junk mail, but that's about it.  When we placed our drink orders, it took almost 20 minutes for our drinks to come out. Now, granted, of the 6 people seated at the table; 3 of us ordered Martinis. I expected those to take a moment. No complaints there. But over 20 minutes for Tea? Seriously? Oh and we had a toddler with us that we ordered Apple Juice for. That took over an hour for them to bring it to us. Were they out pulling apples off the tree to freshly squeeze them or something? Hell, George Washington could of cut down his fathers favorite Cherry Tree and Squeezed us some fresh Cherry juice faster than they brought us a half cup of Apple Juice. Now, on to the food. Both my brother and I ordered our steaks, Rare and Medium Rare. You know what that means? It means you really don't have to cook them that long.. at all. What did we get? 3 little bite sized pieces of Well-Done Recycled Tire Rubber, each. I don't know about you guys, but unless I'm ripping and tearing up the streets in my non-existent Sports car, I'm not really a fan of Burnt Rubber. Save that crap for the Tracks, not for the Plates. So, I kindly requested to speak to a manager. 15 minutes later, the manager ""Ramiro"" shows up. He was actually kind enough to fix the mistake that the Chefs made. ""Awesome!"" we thought. Hopefully there's no Spit/Saliva on these steaks-- but hell, at this point we were so hungry from the long ass wait that we didn't care. We ate the steaks with no problem. As we were eating our steaks, our waitress comes up to us and states, ""My manager said that if you guys order dessert, he'll take it off the bill.""Ok! cool! That's even more so awesome!! but hey, we still don't have the Apple-Juice for the toddler!"" So, we do what people do when they are at the ""CHEESECAKE FACTORY"". We ordered CHEESECAKE!! We do what we normally do, we eachl ordered a slice for ourselves. Everyone orders a different flavor Cheesecake and we all share bites with each other. That's just what family does, am I wrong? The cheesecakes were great! They really were!! They always are! I mean, we had to ask for SPOONS because they failed, at the start, to even give us silverware, but when those spoons FINALLY came out: we grubbed those cheesecakes like no other! Damned Good! But then comes the bill. Now let it be known-- Tonight was, ""Half off the price of any cheesecake"" night. What did the manager do? He removed the price of ONE cheesecake,. Looking at the bill, the cheesecakes came down to $4/5something a pop. Down from the normally $8-10 a slice. But... As I recall... Our waitress specifically said that dessert was on the manager.. But he only removed a single $5 slice of cheesecake? Wait.. Are you serious??? After all the things I brought to his attention, he gave me a $5 discount? Really? This was the straw that broke the camels back. What a complete insult to my family and myself. We brought our 85 year old Grandmother out, with what little energy she had, to enjoy a wonderful dinner with us after we hyped the place up to her, and this is how they treat us? That's just down right insulting. Ramiro, if you're reading this. As I told you when I handed you the bill: You're a Piece of Sh*t. I'm going to contact Corporate HQ tomorrow morning and tell them how crappy of a person you are. I hope they fire your ass and replace you with someone who actually cares for customers. I've never met such a cocky and pompous manager in my life. If you want to act like that, go be a manager for Walmart.

But on the other hand, I felt that the service was somewhat lacking. I do not mean the customer service and the attitude of the waiters, because the waiters were nice. It was just that the wait was somewhat long and when we were wondering why, we noticed the waiters taking selfies in the back. Despite this, the food I ordered was very delicious. I ordered the Chicken Madeira. The chicken was cooked very well, it was juicy and delicious, as opposed to the dry overcooked chicken that I'm used to eating at home. My girlfriend's shrimp, on the other hand, was incredibly overcooked. It was tougher than she wanted. When I tried it, I said that it tasted like chicken.

Pieces of meat, water, straws...its was unacceptable and I was shocked they took us to our table and expected us to be ok with it.

Nobody came so we walked up to the front and asked if we could just have another table. She didn't seem very concerned and said ""ok, your choice"" and then told us the next table would be ready in 45 minutes (restaurant wasn't packed, it's a Thursday night). My husband asked her to just have the place cleaned, she replied with ""well, there was someone already on their way but you said you wanted another table"". To make a long story short, my husband spoke to the manager who never came and checked in on us as she said she would, until we called her and pointed out a piece of meat still left behind, across from our booth. She didn't seem sincere or truly concerned. She was  oblivious. Never returning to this location.... Otay Ranch is definitely better and has better service.

The burger was rare when I ordered it medium well and the cheese was not even melted. NO APOLOGY for it being served 15-20 minutes after the other persons food was brought out.

I made it easy for the server and ordered our appetizer and entrees all at once. I usually order the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps from other locations and it's a perfect portion. I wish my phone wasn't dead so I could've taken a picture of theirs here. It was ALL crispy rice noodle. There was barely and chicken or mushroom and it was chopped up so finely, it was difficult to separate the good stuff from the rice noodles. Before our appetizer even arrived, we waited nearly 45 minutes until it arrived. If the restaurant was packed, I wouldn't have minded, but they weren't even busy. I looked around and I could see other tables looking around hangrily trying to hunt down our server, who was MIA the majority of the time. By the our appetizer came out, our server said our food would be out shortly. My boyfriend and I weren't even half way done with our appetizer and our entrees were out at our table.  Our server never came to ask how our food was, our drinks were empty for a long time before she came by to refill them, and she even took about 20 minutes to come back with our check. It didn't take long for her to drop off our check but it took her a long time to come back with our change. When we left, I looked at the restaurant and they were not busy.

Jessica B.,"San Diego, CA",40,117,91,3.0,12/3/2014,"Definitely kid friendly here.  I really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  Pro is my kids never complain about wanting more because their portions are double the size of any other restaurant portions. Their food is always a hit here.  At this location, the service is horrible.  Their wait times are too long for seating.  The location is beautiful and they have loads of outdoor space.  Make sure you go with time on your hands because their hostess staff and waiters are very slow.   As an appetizer my favorite are the stuffed mushrooms and the ahi tower.  As a dish the shrimp scampi is delicious.  You can't miss with the chocolate cake tower and the strawberry shortcake for dessert. I like to bring my kids here, sit outside on the patio and enjoy San Diego's amazing weather.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=240

We had a new waitress who was a trainee. She was generally attentive but somewhat nervous and robotic, but unlike most Yelpers, I'm willing to give a hard working person a little slack. And, yes, it's a chain, with very good and very unhealthy food and drinks. It's a huge facility and very attractive.

Carolina E.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,87,103,1.0,12/29/2016,My family and I decided to go to this location after the San Diego zoo. We expected a wait just like any other Cheesecake Factory got to this location and they said the wait was 1 hour so we waited. So after more than an hour passed we got seated yay we thought we will finally get to eat we placed our order. I had my two daughters and my niece all hungry and sleepy we waited for 1 hour before we even said hey where the hell is our food the waiter said well it's busy today okay so we spent two hours at this location and nothing we asked to speak to the manager and wala the food came out cold tasteless and honestly so disappointing my potatoes were cold and stale my daughters spaghetti was hard and looked like I have no idea what hard like they left it boiling for a long time my daughters burger was disgusting even my fiancé food was so bad. We told the manager and she offered to have it all re made so why the hell would I spend another hour waiting for food. Honestly if you're going to have your customers wait for so long for food make sure it's good. I been to so many cheesecake factories and never have I asked can we just leave. After the manager saw our food she said yes we can leave without any issues she offered to box the disgusting food for us and charge us for it no thank you I would not want that even if it was free. This completely ruined our night ended going to McDonald's this is my honest review for my visit to this location not all cheesecake factories are like this one.

I think corporate needs to send in an emergency management team to get this location back into line. Our food took 45 minutes to arrive and looking around it seemed like others were having the same problem.  This location is very busy because  its close to the convention center, to Seaport Village and surrounding hotels.

I politely pointed it out that I had discovered the hair in my food and sent the plate back. The waiter was polite and asked if he could replace the dish or a desert which I was completely uninterested in.  Later the manager came over which was appreciated and I continued to be polite expecting him to inform me of what the restaurant would do to make up the mistake which never happened. When I checked the bill I was unhappy to see that over the course of the meal I (and my female friend) spent $70.00 to have an unsanitary dish served to me. I have been in the food and beverage industry my entire life, I am not giving a 1 star rating because of the hair in the food. I understand accidents happen.

Julie W.,"El Cajon, CA",19,40,30,1.0,4/1/2016,"Alright, let me start off by saying I love Cheesecake Factory. Great food great service and all, but.....BUT, this one was just horrible. First things first this place is in a great location at seaport village and the patio is great especially summer nights. Here is where the real problem is, the service is absolutely horrible. Came here for a birthday dinner, 5 people total. Got seated quickly even though it was 6:30pm on a Friday evening. Hostess said ""oh yeah for some reason we aren't busy today"" alright.  Then put our drink orders in. Took an extra minute or two to order our food. Ordered all of our food and then waiting. The waiter came back after 10 minutes white chicken chili was ""out of stock""? Hmmm okay? We'll order something simple chicken Alfredo. Okay.... 45 minutes went by, manager comes over apologizes for the wait says our meals will be out in ""3"" minutes. 10 more minutes pass by our food comes,with the plates scorching hot as if they were under the plate warmers for a while. All meals came but one, chicken Alfredo. Mind you this is what the birthday girl ordered. So we waited for her food to come so we could dig in. 2 minutes pass then 5 and birthday girl told us don't wait for her just eat, we started eating. 10 minutes, the manager comes apologizes gives us the whole ""this is worst case scenario sorry for having you watch everyone eat..."" With no Alfredo in his hand. This guy serious? Dude we just want our food. 10 minutes later... Hooray here comes the Alfredo!  While the rest of us is half way done with our plates. Not looking good. So manager George comes over and says cheesecakes and Couple of meals are comped. At this point we were just fed up. Ordered our 4 cheesecakes to go because we have been there for almost 2 hours now and just wanted to LEAVE. Then the check came. Okay, look here, we don't care about price or money, they said ""we will comp a couple of meals and all dessert"" so it's all about the principle do what you say say what you do right? We get the check only two cheesecakes were taken off and the Alfredo, not the birthday girls drink mind you that (Shirley temple).  Ummm okay we proceeded to tell the waitress the manager said he would comp the desserts and a couple of meals she said oh of course let me take care of that for you. The manager comes back (with an attitude) ""alright what's wrong with your check?"" We told him you said you would take care of some things and he said yeah I comped all of your dessert see here on the receipt? Lol at this point my husband got fired up. The receipt was new and all the desserts were comped, my husband told him this is a different receipt and called him out. The manager George started to become confrontational and asked ""well what else do you want me to do?"" We shouldn't have to ask, things need to just get taken care of, the last thing we want is a manager being an ahole for something that was their fault, second you tried to lie and slip in a new receipt saying here I took care of it in the first place why are you not happy? The first receipt did not have what you said and now you come back with an attitude and a new one almost calling us liars??? Wtf? Uh no we saw what we saw and you tried to play it off as we wouldn't notice. Also, asking us what else we want? No, we are not like those annoying customers who find any reason to get a free meal so we won't ask for more, you need to offer it. He didn't offer it snatched our receipt and then we paid our dues.  We were there from 6:30pm to 8:50pm. Waited for our food for an hour and 15 minutes and just too much drama. The other reviewers are right service is horrible probably one of the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to.

Jacqueline F.,"San Diego, CA",92,41,119,4.0,3/13/2016,"I went to this location yesterday afternoon, it's at a prime tourist spot in downtown SD so we made reservations. My party was seated promptly in a back corner table and we were eager to eat.  Once we ordered our drinks we looked at the EXTENSIVE menus. I felt like Gordon Ramsey on his restaurant makeover show because he would not approve of the endless pages and options. They even had a separate 'skinnylicious' menu for those that wanted a healthier alternative. There was also a nutritional guide that listed every item on the menu, I get it, but it's the CHEESECAKE FACTORY after all. After seeing that some entrees were over 2100 calories, I realized I would make it my cheat day.  I ordered the fried shrimp sandwich with no tomato and fries. The sauce that it was served with was nice since the sandwich lacked flavor or any type of intensity in heat. Oh, and it came with tomatoes.  My mom ordered a medium Caesar salad. I can honestly say I'm glad she didn't get a large, even though she thoroughly enjoyed it, it was the biggest salad we have ever seen in our lives. The portions are huge here.  Others in my party ordered the beet salad, salmon, a burger, and my toddler got the kids meal chicken strips with fruit.  Her strips lacked flavor but she ate them, since she is a toddler, wouldn't recommend an adult ordering them as they would be disappointed. Her 'fruit cup' was diced into teeny tiny bite sized pieces, I wish I would've taken a pic, the fruit was so small that she could barely pick em up and that ended up being a fail.  The cheesecake though.. The cheesecake was an epic success. We ordered the red velvet, key lime, Oreo Dream, and the lemon raspberry cream editions. They were heavenly to say the least. We left around 7 pm and the front area was packed with guests waiting to be seated. I highly recommend getting a reservation as they do get crowded on the weekends.

This time, I visited the new Cheesecake Factory that opened up at The Headquarters, the new shopping/dining center right off of Harbor Drive and Kettner Blvd. I love its convenience because it's within a doable walking distance from my building. My dining companion and I dropped in here on Sunday night and secured a table within a matter of minutes. I'm not going to be as detailed as I was in my previous CF review, but I was equally pleased with my selections this time around. I had the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich with french fries. The bread was fresh and pliable, the spicy sauce gave it just enough heat so as not to be overwhelming, and the chicken breast had a delicious marinade and seasoning. Very pleasing. This time, I wasn't going to leave without dessert. I chose the Banana Cream Cheesecake. The cheesecake came adorned with fresh slices of banana and a generous amount of whipped cream. The texture was light and fluffy, and it tasted like a decadent banana pudding, but in cheesecake form. I swooned in delight.

It was obvious that cilantro had been topped on my fish tacos originally, and then scraped away before serving it to me. There were still little trace pieces all over ... which just sucks. Then my husband payed extra for his side of fries to be substituted for sweet potato fries. We realized we were missing the fries altogether when we got home!! Super sad. We had even asked for extra ketchup for them before we left, ha!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=280
Kevin M.,"Carlsbad, CA",135,7,5,2.0,1/30/2015,"First things first, if you get Ashley as your server, immediately ask for a new one. I was really excited to come here because the first time I went to CF it was an amazing experience; I had great service and everything was on point, then again it was not at this location. When it came time to take our order Ashley didn't seem too happy to be there. Not only did she roll her eyes to one of my friends, but she strongly corrected my best friend on the pronunciation of one of the steak dishes. I understand coming in 20 minutes before closing isn't the best, but growing up in the restaurant business, and having well over 10 years of experience, every customer should be served the same even if it's a minute before closing. We started off with a couple mojitos (props to the bartender for those, they were excellent) and a water for our DD. No refill was offered on the water. We had to ask twice for our bread because she had forgot the first time (the place was dead, I don't understand how she would forget; it's routine to serve bread and refill the water). When our food came out she didn't even seem to know if my shrimp was the correct size. I had to order a different steak because they were out of the fillet minion and on top of that, my entire dish was at room temperature. When I let her know about my cold plate she asked me what she wanted me to have her do about it, and offered to warm it up... Umm, how about offer a fresh off the grill plate?!  Honestly, I don't think Ashley should be working at a restaurant where high expectations are set, because of what she did provide of the service was not great at all. We didn't think twice about tipping. The manager came out and asked if everything was okay, I let him know what happened and he took care of my plate along with the shrimp. I wasn't trying to get my plate taken care of, but every other worker that was there spoke to us with such great tone of voice and excitement. I hope this will never happen again because my first visit to CF still holds a 5 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=280
Ashley H.,"Castaic, CA",2,29,,1.0,6/11/2015,"No wait which was nice and after eating here I know why, customer service sucks!!!! I have been to several Cheesecake Factory locations and this is by far the worst in customer service and food. I know all locations have the same menu but the food was not good at this location. I ordered a California omelette and substituted the mushrooms for asparagus. The dish came out and the potatoes were overcooked and not really edible and when I tried to cut through my omelette, I couldn't cut through the asparagus. The BBQ pizza was no good, not worth eating or taking home. Our waitress only checked on us once, she was supposed to bring us a refill and it never came. Of course when the check came she was quick to get that out. I wanted to ask for a manager but didn't have enough time to wait for him/her.  I will NOT be back to this location and would not recommend it to anyone......unless I don't like that person Almost forgot***bathrooms were disgusting, trash overflowed to the floor and food on the floor.

I was very hungry because I had not had breakfast, so I ordered a sausage and ricotta flat bread for $6.50 and their Turkey Burger for $9.95, both of their Skinnyliscious menu.  The flat bread offering, although small,  was quite tasty and delicious. ( ) The ricotta fluffy piles of creamy and smooth goodness with great flavor. ( ) The sausage was tender and well seasoned, but it would of been nice if it had a well developed fennel flavor. ( ) I enjoyed the garlic crumbs, and herbs that were sprinkled on top. Nice touch. The flat bread was ultra thin, but firm and crispy and enough to hold up to the ingredients, ( ) but please make it a little bigger. My grilled turkey burger came with a side salad, in lieu of fries. My choice. ( ) The turkey burger was very good, one of the better ones I have had. It came with a pile of tender sauteed onions on top ( ) and a flavorful garlic mayonnaise with bits of parsley, which I spread on a golden toasted buttered bun. ( ) The mayo was good, but the star was the turkey grilled patty. The patty was mixed with Fresh Mushrooms, Garlic and Spices and then sprinkled with coarse black pepper. The results was a great flavored and a juicy patty, helped along by the high moisture content mushrooms carry. ( ) A smart preparation if you ask me. The sesame bun was moist and a little sweet. It was well toasted and a good vessel for the turkey burger. ( ) The tomato slices were fresh, and they gave me chopped lettuce instead lettuce leaves. I enjoyed the burger very much. My server Niya was great. Her service was appropriately timed and very friendly. At the time, I was to full to even consider ordering a slice of cheesecake to go, but now I am hungry and regretting my decision.

Pretty much exactly what you would expect.  Just not enough other textures for my taste, I think it would have been much better with some corn in there. Roadside Sliders ($5.50): meh, nothing interesting or noteworthy.  very skip-able imho Chicken Pot Stickers ($5.50): well cooked, but they had these tiny ground chicken-like balls inside and they were swimming in a sauce with waaaay too much garlic for my taste.  I won't order these again. Fried Chicken Sliders ($5.50): 4 decent sized sliders, definitely a good value at HH price.  light, crispy, with a reasonable sized piece of chicken under that batter.  Not bad, just a little bland in the favor department.

F for plate presentation .. i bite into it it doesn't taste right .. take another i taste that it is overly salty .. I have my wife try a bite she immediately spits it out says send it back since I am on a low sodium diet .. I have to wait another 10 mins or so for the manager to waiter to walk by , then another 10 mins for a manager and he offers to take it off the tab and make things right .. no problem he asked if I wanted another meal I said no he asked if we were ordering anything else I said yes desert .. he said ok we will get it taken care of .. assuming maybe I would get desert comped or something .... NOPE .. my server said the manager was going to bring us our bill and come talk to me .. nope I get handed the bill where the meal was taken off but no comp on the desert .. I don't want anything for free that's not what I am complaining about I think after spending $100 on a meal for my family where I didn't even get to enjoy it 15 bucks in cheese cake comped would have been acceptable ..

Don't check how you're doing, don't recommend any dishes or anything, that's fine I suppose.  On to the food, my dish (Louisiana chicken pasta) was okay until you started eating the rest and realized that the consistency of the pasta was off.

My favorite Cheesecake Factory experience has to be the first one I visited in college many years ago in Marina Del Rey, right on the marina - great view, fun atmosphere, generous portions.  This one is at least closer to that atmosphere than the Mission Valley one -- right in Seaport Village, w/ plenty of paths to walk off the meal you just ate and enjoy the view.  No surprises; the same menu, and similar feel you'd expect from a chain CF.  But I did appreciate the Skinnylicious menu, which I guess has been around for awhile -- lots of options under 590 calories or less (not too skinny, but better than the alternatives), and cocktails for 150 calories or less.  I tried the Tuscan Chicken from the Skinnylicious menu, and it was surprisingly great - generous portion, lots of flavor - tomatoes, capers and articokes, over just a touch of farro.  My friend had the lemon shrimp w/ angel hair pasta (also from the Skinnylicious menu) and said it was really good, too.  The cheesecakes, of course, are wonderful, and tempting, but passed on them by this time.   Parking: is either valet, or park at Seaport Village and they do a partial validation (it cost us $3 to park for lunch).  A welcome addition to the downtown/Seaport Village scene.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=300

You'll get seated relatively quick at this location, even during dinner time in the weekend. The restaurant has plenty of small and large tables and booths to accommodate any party. There's also a nice bar area and plenty of outside seating. I would recommend to sit outside during summer nights because you might be to catch the firework show. Overall this is a great location, definitely one of the best Cheesecake Factories in San Diego. If you want to avoid the large crowds  and not drive 15-20 minutes east of the 805 to get to the Otay Ranch location, then this one is great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=340

Kelly D.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,5,4,4.0,3/29/2016,My first time at the Cheesecake Factory!  The menu is more like a book because they have just about everything.  They bring warm bread and it is tasty! The food was great. I had the Chicken Madeira pasta and it was cooked perfectly. The best part of the meal? Cheesecake of course!! We opted to take a slice of lemon meringue and vanilla bean cheesecake home.  Wow- it lived up to our expectations.  Outside dining in the front of the building and you have to pay for parking in a lot out back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=340
Sarah F.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,17,1,5.0,10/5/2015,"I dined at the Cheesecake Factory last night with my family. We were a decent sized group of 7, and were ravenous after a weekend of travel and the prospects of a late dinner. The Cheesecake Factory was obviously busy, and the wait was 20 mins, we were thrilled when our pager went off. We had my 95 year old grandmother in tow and they were quickly able to seat us and accommodate for her handicap, this included finding a cozy spot for her walker to sit near our booth. We were waited on in no time and had food at our table quickly. Near the end of our evening, my father had to shift out of our booth requiring me to scoot over. When I went to move my leg, I realized my pants were stuck to the bottom of the booth. Upon further inspection, I found a giant wad of chewing gum that had been carelessly deposited on the bottom of the booth had fused to my jeans. We were quickly able to flag down our waitress who called in back up with ice and clean towels to remove the gum from my jeans and the booth. Shortly after, the manager stopped by our table to offer his condolences and offered me a free trip to the dry cleaners on the house. I was able to clean off the gum on my own, so I didn't need dry cleaning, and he quickly offered me a desert of my choosing. The staff acted quickly last night and turned a sticky situation into a successful family outing, and I am deeply grateful. Thank you to everyone who helped us last night!

Dana R.,"El Cajon, CA",118,283,189,4.0,12/31/2013,"We visited this location during the craziness of the Big Bay Balloon Parade. There had to be over 100 people in line before they opened at 11:00. The wait for our party of 14 was 40 minutes. We were told the wait would be ""a little bit."" We were expecting a shorter wait.  Once we were sat, our team of waiters was efficient and friendly and very patient with our party of three adults and ten children. The food, mostly burgers, was excellent. The cheesecake was decadent.  We will go back for sure. My only suggestion to management would be to provide water to people waiting outside. For a newly opened restaurant with a newer wait staff, I think they did a great job handling the one hundred plus people that rushed in their doors this morning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=340

Charicki E.,"Bonita, CA",0,18,5,1.0,8/17/2014,"Unimpressed. The service was poor, no one greeted my daughter and I at the host station or the table other than to ask how many? The server did not greet us and his only words were, do you know what you want to drink, do you want to order now, can i see your ID, do you want to add to your order, can i get you another glass of wine, and would you like to see the cheesecake menu? No greeting, no smile, no check on how the food was, no offer of refill for my child's drink or an alternate beverage for myself. No goodbye, thank you for visiting-I wish I believed in leaving no tip because this was truly poor service.  My daughter's chocolate milk was made with some kind of thick dark chocolate syrup that was chunky in the bottom and I sent back the first time to add more syrup because the milk was still almost white. The burger bun was soggy with meat juice and disgusting looking. And the server didn't even stop by to ask how was everything or else I would have mentioned the bun's-imagine both buns soggy with grayish pink meat juice-yuck, usually they are toasted or plain. No offer or question whether I would like condiments either. This location could use some service skills...oh yeah and walking in, instead of the servers stepping aside as we the guests walked to our seats, they rushed by almost fighting for space while i held my daughter behind me so she wouldn't be trampled. And on the way out the larger men who may or may have not been employees stood in a triangle of three talking while I had to say excuse me loudly for the one on the right of the path to at least take an inch backwards so I could pass.  Plain poor service, and I have been to many CCF's, but I expect at least a minimum level of service and a fake smile at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=340

Nicole M.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,1.0,7/27/2014,"I have been to Cheesecake Factories in Colorado, Virginia Beach, Chicago, and California. Usually the food is pretty good, though I avoid going because it is a chain and there are so many other great restaurants to try in new cities. After going to the Cheeksecake Factory on Harbor Dr today (had a gift card I needed to use), I decided I really am never going back. I ordered the pit beef dip, which was $14 and probably the worst sandwich I have ever had (the meat was literally all fat). I had a lot higher expectations, especially for the price! The fries were also cold. I haven't been to one in awhile and today realized how much they have raised the prices, granted you do get a lot of food but it is nothing special.  I recommend going just for dessert, don't bother with paying a ton of money for their entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=340

Service was slow when they are not even that busy. One star just because its a beautiful restaurant but the food is not great. There is a better restaurant where i will pay the same price but the taste is way much better. Yes, i should have gone to that place instead but i just thought to give CheeseCake factory a try...

I'm not sure if this place is great because they just opened and really want to impress their guests, or if they're just going to be better in general. I mean don't get me wrong, you have a few waiters/waitresses that you look at and say ""I'm really glad they're not helping me or else I would be starving"", but ours was on top of it as well as everyone else we encountered.

Getting a table didn't take too long, but overall, we were in the restaurant for a good 2 1/2 hours. The entrees took FOREVER to come and by the time they had arrived we had already lost our appetite eating bread and appetizers.  What really bothered us was that we didn't so much get an apology or acknowledgment from our waitress until my husband returned his entree. While management did attempt to make things better, we had been waiting far too long at this point and didn't really enjoy our experience. I don't know if it's a lack of staff or a slow kitchen - but something needs to change at this location.

His with the Steak Diane with Chicken Madeira, and mine Steak Diane with Salmon, both meals came with mashed potatoes. Best part of meal were the potatoes, which is sad. I've has the same meal at the fashion valley location and it was phenomenal. One of the main reasons why I wanted to come here for our family friendly anniversary. Our son got the corn dog meal. I really don't understand why they use small skinny kebob skewers for the corn dogs. All three fell off of their sticks. I just felt like it was a let down and a waste of money honestly.

Miguel V.,"Rome, Italy",173,12,,1.0,5/24/2016,"This review is based solely on randomly chosen items on the menu. The service, for all intents and purposes, was fine for a chain restaurant. Ambiance and locale, perfect for a cocktail or lunch menu if there is literally no other place to eat.  Complimentary bread/butter: A bread yes, definitely not edible without tons of cheap butter, no.  1. Dynamite shrimp: Frozen shrimp of low quality taste fishy and gummy regardless of proper frying or seasoning/batter. I like to eat my shrimp, not chew! 2. Chicken costoletta: MASSIVE serving, I'm talking 3-4 proper servings. Unfortunately for Cheesecake Factory, large portions don't make up for lack of fresh ingredients, dry chicken, and horrible smashed potatoes- if you can call them that. Recommendation, skip.  3. Chicken club avocado: At first glance a brioche bun topped with decadent grilled chicken, fresh sliced tomatoes, and avocado/bacon sounds out of this world. However, brioche? From what planet? Well toasted bread swimming in butter, maybe margarine or oil flavored butter? Horrible. Chicken is tasteless, no salt or seasoning to be had. Bacon, how can you mess up bacon, well if you make lots of it and leave it sitting in a warmer, that's how. Better yet, frozen bacon that's reheated! Avocado, ripe. Tomato, fruits are supposed to be sweet, wholesome, and that unmistakable acidity, nope! Instead you get a sorry excuse for a tomato adding to the soggy bread. Fries, lord, stale fries of all things, at least frozen fries taste good, not here folks!  4. Red Velvet cheesecake: Frozen, pre-made, massed produced cream cheese muck, compact/flavorless/oily ""red velvet cake"", and whipped cream? HA! Canned.  Real bread, try Bread and Cie, you'll die. Want real pasta? Try Parma Cucina Italiana on Hillcrest. Pizza/flatbread? Cafe Calabria. Tempura shrimp, take your pick at any Japanese restaurant on Convoy st. Chicken club? Easy, try any gastro pub/American with a reputable source of bacon, say Draft Republic in UTC. Cheesecake? If this is your definition of good cheesecake? Leave this review and eat at the Cheesecake Factory. If you'd like to try something worthwhile then try Extraordinary Desserts on Union st., yes, this one and not the other near Balboa park.  Best part about this, I didn't pay a dime. Gift card. Worth it? Sure, if you like cheap, greasy, no finesse/culinary sense, and a nice ambience to which to impress your date.

Joe T.,"Chula Vista, CA",89,200,449,4.0,2/21/2015,"We came here for a late Valentine's dinner. Meaning we came about a week after Valentine's Day. First of all the Decour in this place is beautiful. It used to be the old San Diego Police Department headquarters. It's about one block from the San Diego Bay and right in front of Seaport Village. Also it's a couple blocks from the entrance of the Gaslamp. My wife and I were really impressed with the inside. We were seated with in five minutes! Keep in mind this was a Friday night at 9 o'clock and it was really busy. I was shocked on how fast we got seated. The meal was really good. We ordered a freaking huge burrito and some pasta. I forget the names of the actual orders. The meals came out rather quickly except we forgot to ask for chicken with our pasta. I wish the server would've asked us if we wanted chicken or not. But she was able to make a couple breast of chicken within five minutes and send it out to us. Our server's name was Kimora. She was really friendly and very helpful. I only wish she would've offered us water and come to check on us at least one more time. She came by once to drop off our meal, once to bring the forgotten chicken and once for the check. Overall she was great. The atmosphere was fairly quiet and the people were dressed casual. I was really impressed by the large menu, I didn't expect to have so many choices to pick from.

Emily R.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,19,2,1.0,3/25/2016,"one star strictly for service!!!  I go to the Escondido Cheesecake Factory with a group of friends almost monthly, we love it so much. Came to SD with the same group of friends to drop off a friend at the airport and we were over an hour early, so we decided to stop at one of our go-too restaurants (Cheesecake Factory). We came in around 2:50 pm on Mar. 24th and had planned to leave the restaurant by 4:00 pm to get her to the airport on time. We thought no biggie of course because it was such a weird hour and wasn't very busy inside. Our server was training a new server and none of us thought twice about it because we are all servers as well and have all been there before. But our server was absolutely AWFUL. We put in our order right away when he came to us for drinks and all ordered either a salad or a sandwich with nothing that had to actually even be cooked, which is why it absolutely shocked us we hadn't gotten our food 45 minutes into waiting. We got one basket of bread out of our server and no water/ soda refills in that 45 min as well so we were starting to get really frustrated. We ended up waving down the trainee and having her ask the guy who was our server to close out our checks (even before the food came) because it was taking so long and we were on a time restraint. 3:50 pm comes around and everyone at the table has gotten their salad BUT me... I had to wave down our server again after 5 min because he didn't even come over to check on us or tell me why mine was taking forever, and after having to ask him what was the deal with my Beet Salad he gave me the excuse that he didn't think it looked good enough to send out so he had them re make it? But he didn't think he should have to tell me it would be awhile longer while on a time crunch. Got my Beet Salad to - go without even looking at it and was forced to eat it two hours later with it wilted and disgusting. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

However, this locations service was garbage to say the least. I came here with my fiance and there was a 25 minute wait, which is understandable because there was a lot of people. But you would expect them to take at least our drink orders right away after waiting that long. Guess again. We waited about 15 minutes for the server to come and take our drink orders. Then we waited another 15-20 for just our APPETIZER to come.

The Loaded Baked Potato Bites were great, but I think Arby's has something similar but cheaper.  Things got a little strange when talking to our waiter, the conversation moved to where his home was, then somehow onto a tattoo he had on his back.  He wanted to show us but we denied him the chance.  He was a charismatic person but not the right time to offer that to our dinner.  We also had just left a conference and pretty sure all those people walked down so the inside was a bit humid and sweaty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=320

jessica c.,"Seattle, WA",12,225,,2.0,9/8/2014,"After a day of travel and eating during off hours, my boyfriend and I found ourselves hungry at about 10:30pm on a weeknight and staying next door at the Hyatt. We found that everything closes up shop in that area around 10p or 11p and we didn't want to pay for overpriced room service, so we booked it across the street because we knew this place closed at 11. We walked in at about 10:45 and I acknowledged we knew they were getting ready to close and asked if they were still accepting tables. The bar was already closed otherwise we would've grabbed a seat there because I realize it's super annoying to show up at a restaurant when all the workers want to do is wrap it up for the night. The 2 hostesses reluctantly and with an attitude told us they sat people until 11pm. They then whispered to themselves and when the girl started to walk us back to the table the other one replied, ""don't do it! you can't!"".  The seated us in the very back corner of the restaurant away from all the rest of the tables of people still there eating. 10 minutes go by and no waters, no silverware, nothing. Finally a server that had walked by a couple times asked us if we had been helped and when we told her no she apologized, said that was horrible service and that it wasn't technically her table but that she would of course help us. She got us waters, took our order, and then came back and said even though their bread was supposed to be done for the night that she found a different type of loaf and heated that up for us if that was ok. About 10 minutes later the lady who was supposed to be our waitress showed up and apologized and advised she was on her smoke break and that no she had no idea that anyone had been seated in her section. That explains what the 2 hostesses were whispering about. We appreciated her apologizing as I'm sure it was not entirely her fault and it seemed as though the 2 hostesses threw her under the bus by putting us in her section when they knew she was on her break. She was fine the rest of the time and the other lady who had stepped in to wait on us also came by to check on us again. Really disappointed that I don't remember her name because that's an example of a great worker who takes on a table that isn't even her's at the end of a night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=360

Total turn off. Then I noticed the utensils were on the table. Gross. At least place it into napkins. I ordered the Renee's Special which comes with soup, salad, and a sandwich. You can never go wrong with salad. But the soup was not as hot. And then the sandwich... The bread was rock hard! I literally could bang the bread with my utensils or on the table and it would not dent or break! How can anyone possibly bite into that?! There's no way without breaking your teeth! Overall the food was okay. It's decent. It's always a hit or miss with their entrees. But in retrospect, I would rather eat elsewhere. The food quality and taste for the prices that they charge is not worth it.

I ordered the BBQ chicken salad with the dressing on the side. It came out with everything covered in dressing. AND they forgot to put the avocado, which was a determining factor for ordering.  Their normally delicious complimentary sourdough break was hard as a rock. I wouldn't complain normally since it is a free item but it's a signature of this place to serve delicious squaw and sourdough bread. When I flagged down another employee to have it replaced since our waitress was. I where to be found, the girl told me she would bring us another but that they were all that way?!! Crazy! Well she never. Roughy us the replacement rock bread so I have no idea if all the bread was the same. Their squaw bread was delicious as usual.  They also didn't have lemonade. The waitress was baffled as to why that was and blamed the kitchen.  1 star because the food still tasted good. Another star because the place is beautiful and in such a great location!

Today, I sat politely as I watched another patron with his wife spoken to by the waiter very rudely.  It was so embarrassing, had I been them, I would have walked out on principle.  It was either a Samoan or Hawaiian waiter who works out of the bar area. He also waited on me.  He was polite during our exchange, but after ordering a not so pleasant meal, he made the observation that I had barely touched the plate.  I never complain or ask for anything, but he took notice, apologized, and reassured me he would waive it from the bill (without a peep from me!).  I was taken aback, as again, it was his observation, not my complaining.  I was impressed, but this was soured shortly later when he returned and stated ""the manager refused to take it off"".  Two things:  1) If you're not empowered to make a situation right, then don't offer to resolve a situation you are incapable of resolving.  That resulted in a HUGE let down for a customer 2) I'm OCD.  I notice everything.  I actually watched as you merely walked your lying self to the register, stared around a bit.  Noticed me looking at you, then returned to the table with check in hand.  At no point did you speak or ask assistance from a manager.   You're attitude and lack of any concern for any and all customers is costing this business money and repeat customers.  I truly hope someone addresses your employment there.

Major plus!  No one in our party of five (youngest: age two) had any leftovers (aside from the kids side of fruit) and we all walked away happy.  Speaking of the children's side of fruit, I don't know if the apples were cut with a knife that had previously been used for onions, or if onions were somehow mixed in with the apples (??!) but we learned very quickly why my son wouldn't touch his apples - and he loves apples!

Anne G.,"Chula Vista, CA",83,13,,3.0,1/19/2015,"My experience was okay. I went with a party of women on Saturday around 2:15pm.  The food was delicious but the service wasn't all that great. We had a male server on Saturday who was okay at first but started to become rude when we asked him questions.  The ladies in my party wanted him to wait on us and then leave him no tip but I did not want to deal with a rude or bi-polar waiter for the duration of our lunch.   I decided to switch to another server or waitress and she was fantastic.  I do not know her name but she had a tattoo on her wrist and had brown curly hair. She was helpful, sweet, and was very accommodating.  She made the rest of our Cheesecake experience wonderful. Since our receipts had our original waiter on them, we decide to pay our bill with no tip to our original waiter.  Instead,  we handed our wonderful waitress a 20% tip. She deserved it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=420

I have to say that I did not enjoy my cheesecake much but I think I just picked the wrong one this time since I usually enjoy anything I order there. The cheesecake was overly sweet and I couldn't finish it. I loved the staff, all friendly and very attentive to customers. Kudos to server Matt who was very patient and helpful in recommending a wine and describing the cheesecakes for me and my friend. Ambiance and noise level were perfect for an intimate dinner had it not been for the tables so close together that it almost seemed like the people next to us were listening in on our conversation and we felt we were in on theirs.

I have never been a huge fan of the fashion valley location. It is just awkward and too busy. We came here for lunch on a busy Saturday. Being next to sea port village we had a couple of options for parking. There was no free street parking left so we opted for valet. It is a little steep at $15.00 however if you plan to make a day of it down there it would be worth it.  Stepping into the restaurant I was absolutely in love with the details, color scheme and overall sleek look. It was a beautiful day but we were seated inside.  To eat I ordered a cheese burger and fries. My boyfriend had the club sandwich and fries with a Green flash ipa. My first fries were a little cold so our server brought me new hot, fresh fries. My favorite! The burger had such great flavor and was moist and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend said his club sandwich was delicious too. Our server was super nice and accommodating.  I would come back here in a heartbeat over fashion valley at least for lunch.

The restaurant and servers look nice on the outside but when it comes to organization and dealing with large groups they were under trained. The servers were confused about who the orders belonged to and resorted to asking the diners. It took an hour to get our food and one order was forgotten. I had to ask two servers to bring a straw for my drink which took over 11 minutes. By this time appetites were ruined to the point where some of my friends just asked for a bag to go because they got full off of the bread, soup of the day and drinks. In addition, the food taste like medicine!

He had no clue when we asked what is the best cheesecake and requested to give some information about a particular cheesecake.

CFM C.,"Petaluma, CA",0,34,32,1.0,5/18/2015,"Okay, let me start by saying I normally enjoy dining at The Cheese Cake Factory and have never had problems. Our family was visiting San Diego for a college graduation and staying at a nearby hotel so we thought of ordering a Cheese Cake for our celebration party.  I called a week ahead of time and ordered a 7"" cake for a pickup at 1PM on May 16, 2015. I also stated that I needed a precut cake which the girl over the phone confirmed wasn't a problem. We arrived on time for our pickup only to find a waiter talking to the two bakery counter girls asking for a cheese cake (or plate itself) to be inscribed with chocolate writing for another graduation party group that was dining there. The two girls flatly told the waiter ""We don't do that!"", even after the waiter begged a second time in order to keep the dining customers happy. This waiter left in discuss. At this point we were next in line and knew we were dealing with very unfriendly and uncaring employees. Sure enough, we told the girl we were here to pick up a preordered cake and she gave it to us. At this point I reconfirmed that the cake was precut like we had ordered so that we didn't have to deal with cutting it in the hotel room. At this point she SNAPED back that we don't cut cheese cakes here! and went on to say that when ordering cakes we never agree to cut cakes!  Even after asking nicely, she refused to cut the cake for us in a nasty tone. After asking she finally gave us a plastic knife to cut it ourselves in the hotel room. Of course when we returned to the hotel with our $30.00 Cheese Cake, the plastic knife did nothing but make a mess of the cake and wasn't strong enough to cut through the base of it. We returned later that day to get the name of the two girls but of course they had already left for the day. All in all, a very bad experience and these two girls have no business working in a field they hate so much. We had ZERO customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=380

It's a beautiful, lovely restaurant in very good condition. Our server was fairly slow, especially when it came time to pay the check.

Wife had skiing long island iced tea, which was good. I had the skinny chopped salad - nice volume. Wife had the turkey & avocado sandwich, which she enjoyed. Tab was $60.

As an avid visitor of Seaport Village, it was nice to find a place to sit and eat without paying for something that was just ""okay"".   I was easily impressed by how attentive everyone was with filling our water glasses, replacing our lap napkins and making sure that our food was good.  Our server (I can't remember his name, but when I return, I will make sure to seek him out to give him the right praise on yelp) was nice enough to offer us warm towelettes to wipe our hands.   Happy Hour prices are reasonable.  I ordered the ""skinny"" chicken tacos: grilled chicken breast with lettuce and salsa on the side, which came with three.  My friend ordered the thai chicken lettuce wraps.  I've had the wraps before and enjoy all of the flavor options they give you with the different sauces they have on the side.  The only disclaimer is that it gets messy, but you can live with messy with this delicious ""salad"" option.

Then my son had a fork that still had good stuck to it that was dry and crusty.  Food - I ordered the Diane's steak, and it was good. Wife got salad but unfortunately had a hair in it. Did not mention because she did not want to seem like she wanted anything free; just stopped eating it. Son ordered burger which he said was good but couldn't eat the fries as they were too salty.

This one is brand-spankin' new, the service was wonderful, the decor fresh, and there are heaters out on the patio. And, of course, most importantly, there are lots of new menu items too! As in, an actual separate menu of ""new"" items...just when I thought their menu couldn't get more extensive. It's a book...like literally it's 20 pgs with over 50 different cheesecakes. Yummmm... My friend and I both took a glance at the menu, went over to the ""Brunch"" section, and for SOME reason, ended up picking the exact same thing, and that was the MONTE CRISTO SANDWICH.

Boy was I mistaken. Please accept my apologies, Mr. Factory. Here are the ingredients. I have listed them individually for more emphasis.   -Crunchy french toast STUFFED with  -Bacon, -Grilled ham, -Scrambled eggs, - & Melted swiss cheese -Dusted w/ powdered sugar - & Served with Strawberry preserves (this last ingredient I didn't really need). -AND you get to choose a side! You can get potatoes/french fries or if you feel guilty like me, you can request fruit.

Maybe she was having a really bad night & it wasn't personal I thought. I didn't want to return the rudeness to her. After I asked her She says ""yea"" with an attitude. I smile & ask her can she refill our drinks for us. She comes back 8 mins later with our drinks. She walks to all her other tables talking refilling drinks, etc. our main courses come out, again brought by others. We start eating & regardless of her lack of service, still having a good time & reflecting on our trip. Another 10 mins go by she hasn't check on us, seen how anything was going, etc. A nice young lady in the section ask if we are ok and can she get anything for us. I ask her was her co worker always like this with people. She looks at her, rolls her eyes, looks back at me smiling while asking did I want to talk to management? I told her that it's ok, there are a lot of people in here. It's busy, I'll talk to him another time. I did tell her our service was horrible! She apologized and asked again did I want to talk to management. I tell her again that I don't want to make a scene, but I will chat with him later. I asked her to get our waiter for me though. Our server (Jasmine Z.) comes over & says yes. I asked her for the check & boxes. She immediately walks away but stops at every table she has, refills drinks, gets napkins, etc. she finally comes back and sets the tab down & leaves. She comes back 5 mins after, collects it, drops the boxes off, & walks away. There was not enough boxes & she didn't ask us about how we wanted it split. She opened it & seen cards, walks over and asked ""how we wanted it."" We told her just divide it, it didn't have to be to each order. She comes backs then walks to the front.  We pack up, shake our heads, & begin to head out. She ignored us the whole time but stood by he manager, smiling, & telling us have a good night. The young lady that actually  helped us was standing there disgusted. I was not going to bother but this has literally be the most disrespectful experience I've ever had. I was a server for YEARS!!! If I don't have enough to tip at least 18%, I DONT GO OUT TO EAT. PERIOD. She treated us horribly & was one of the most uncouth human beings I've ever experience!!! Do yourself a favor Cheesecake Factory, LOSE JASMINE Z. Before u lose loyal customers. I making an appointment  with management today. She thought when we left it was over! It's not about the money. I don't want any of it back! It's not the corporation fault, the kitchens fault, or anyone's but HERS!!! I will be calling management today to see if He will be look at surveillance!   I don't want to money, I WANT HER FIRED!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=400
Stefanie O.,"San Diego, CA",41,55,31,3.0,5/28/2014,"It is all at once comforting and disappointing to eat at a chain restaurant.  My dining experience here at the Cheesecake Factory at the Headquarters was no different.   The menu is online so I won't go into any of that, but rather speak of this location.  I work down the street and we walked over to a great outdoor patio that kept a patio feel.  They use comfy couch like booths for the tables and it is directly on the street where the trolleys go by.  There is a view of Kansas City BBQ and a bit of cab/pedicab watching on a slow day.   The staff is attentive and positive.  Great overall dining experience and is probably a wonderful addition for the convention crowd.   I am still getting over the fact that I was eating at a mall restaurant when I waited a year to see what they were putting into the renovated police station.

Melissa H.,"San Diego, CA",30,50,52,1.0,1/1/2014,"Happy New Year's!  Okay so my daughter and I went here for a New Year's Eve meal, it was not what I expected having been to Cheesecake Factory all over the US.  This one was the worst!  When we arrived we were not greeted, instead we listened to a bad rendition of happy birthday being sung by like twenty servers to one server while I helplessly waited to be acknowledged.  Then the girl who helped us was very unprofessional, she looked around like she would find someone to help us and then she decided to get a couple menus and help us herself...what a novel idea!  Unfortunately she was still trapped behind the birthday girl and her posse who blocked the girl in behind the host/hostess area so she could not seat us...maybe this was a fire hazard?   So the girl (title is unknown) walks us to a table where she seats us and profusely apologizes to my daughter for not having another New Year's streamer blow deal (clearly I do not know the name of this contraption, but it makes a lot of noise.  It should be called a noise maker but I digress).  Eventually we reached our table and our server Scott showed up, took our drink orders and disappeared.  Apparently at this Cheesecake Factory they really get into the ""spirit"" of the occasion because I turned around just as a gang of what appeared to be servers and chefs loudly counted down the ball dropping in Times Square on the tv.  I didn't watch it, I've seen that show and I know how it ends.  About ten minutes later Scott returns with our drinks, lemonades and takes our food orders.  My daughter has to go to the restroom.  We excuse ourselves to the restroom, leaving our drinks, silverware, my daughter's coloring book, and whatever else we can to let them know that hey we just sat down and now we're just going to the loo.  When we return the table is completely blank:  no silverware, no glasses, beverages are missing...I think we've been robbed.   By this time I see Scott and ask him to change our order to a to-go order since it's taking a while still.  I don't even finish my sentence before another server comes out with our food, a cheese pizza for the princess and shrimp scampi for me.  My shrimp scampi was $19.95 with several pieces of large, seasoned shrimp and a big ball of molded pasta in the middle of the plate.  The pasta was so disgusting.  I guess anything is supposed to look better with parsley right?  Well maybe olive oil would have prevented it from sticking because it was stuck together like a ball.  I literally sat there like a kid trying to get the pasta unstuck, to onlookers appearing as if playing with my food.   To make a long story longer Scott messed up our dessert order of a red velvet cheesecake and a lemon pie for my daughter.  I should have been suspect when he said ""do you want lemon cheesecake or lemon pie"" and I said lemon pie.  He returned with some type of lemon confection that was not lemon pie.  I was surprised anyhow that CF would have lemon pie since they specialize in cheesecake.  But they also have apple crisp and other non-cheesecake items.  Anyhow it was a horrible NYE/NY experience.  The only thing that made it worthwhile was enjoying it with my daughter who only cared about her missing coloring book that they somehow stole and ""couldn't find"".  It was a mess, a lovely mess and if I do not go to this CF location again in 2014 it will be too soon! I tried to make it comical because in reality it was anything but funny.  It was really a horrible experience and it just happened to be on NYE/NY 2014.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=400

I've lived in Seattle before and I'm glad Ivar Haglund isn't alive to hear me say this, but: the VERY BEST clam chowder I've ever had was from The Cheesecake Factory.

We are then seated promptly and the most helpful and courteous waitress is here to take our order with a happy smile and skip in her step. She catered very well to our orders, memorizing all of them down the to spot and she made sure that our cups were full, but she always asked before filling. Her is name is Dawn. She not only gave us excellent service but she also lead us to the exit and directed the way to the jail cells left in the courtyard. I have never experienced better service. Now that the service is out of the way, we can get to the food. The food itself was excellent. Everything tasting fresh and flavorful plus getting all of out food in a rather quick amount of time just upped the entire experience. I myself ordered an omelette with Goat Cheese, Spinach, Bacon, and Mushrooms. It was cooked perfectly with everything tasting great. My mom ordered the Monte Cristo and said it not only looked tantalizing but tasted very good. My Father and Grandfather ordered the chilaquiles and it was presented beautifully with a taste to match. If you're worried about them being spicy, they weren't (this is coming from my father who has a rather low tolerance for spicy foods). The atmosphere is rather pleasant. If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory you've pretty much been to them all. Some may say it has a tourist type feel to it but it's to the contrary.

All were fantastic, but what really made the experience was our waiter Cory.

I was dissuaded by the waitress from ordering salad as that would take 20 minutes.  I didn't see the logic of that after we waited over 40 minutes for food.  The waitress said they were trying to recover from the weekend.  Wish we had been told that when we were waiting to be seated.  We would have grabbed some quick grub on the Midway instead and saved some pretty penny, and time. Asian lettuce wrap and herb crusted salmon were great.  Grilled steak medallions was short on steak, unlike at the one we are used to in Huntington Beach, about half the thickness. And overdone when we asked for medium.  No zing neither.  Sigh, went the crossfit fanatic husband. The Chicken pasta was undercooked with chicken overcooked and dry; kids did not care for it, which indicated a big thumbs down.   The worst was the Pecan Turtle cheesecake--ick, ick, ick!  I've had bad dessert at CF, consistently.  This chain does not live up to it's name for dessert, me thinks.  My whole family agrees unanimously on this, even the kids.  They need to whip up some fresher, healthier, tastier desserts.  Until then, pass on bad dessert, and this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=440

Kenneth C.,"San Diego, CA",11,13,,3.0,4/20/2014,"I came here late on a Saturday night. I've never been to this Cheesecake Factory. This one is located right around the corner of Seaport Village. I'll start off with the parking. I didn't really find designated parking for this place. I found side parking right around the corner and just paid for parking. Almost every parking in downtown is paid parking so that didn't really bother me. This place is actually located inside a marketplace alongside other restaurants and stores. The first thing I noticed when I walked in is the ambient lighting inside. All of the Cheesecake Factories I've been to have this distinct lighting. This gives the restaurant an upscale look from exterior to interior. There is also outside seating to enjoy the San Diego view. If this place is your first time, you will notice that there is an area where you can actually order their famous cheesecakes in full pie sizes if you want. It's been a long time since I've actually had one of their cheesecakes but from what I remember, their cheesecakes tasted pretty good. Now if you want mind blowing cheesecakes, then hit up Extraordinary Desserts, but that's another story to talk about later. There is also a bar located inside with several TVs that display sports. We were seated right away. The restaurant didn't look too packed late at night. The menu list is full of variety. They have sandwiches, burgers, pasta, specialties, cheesecakes, and etc. I didn't find anything too expensive. Most meals averaged around $14 - $16. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms for like $17.50. After you order, you are served 2 loafs of bread: sourdough and some kind of brown honey oat. The brown honey oat bread usually tastes fantastic because it's sweet tasting. I was actually a little disappointed this time because both loafs of bread felt a little stale and tasted dry. The waitress also didn't ask us if we wanted more bread. After we finished the bread quickly, we sat there and waited a good 20 minutes for the food to be finished. Now if you ask me, 20 minutes is a bit on the longer side unless you're ordering the perfect lobster or filet mignon. Once the food arrived, I was actually a little surprised. The plate was actually filled. My meal had like 3 pieces of thinly sliced chicken breast on top of a good amount of bow tie pasta and mushrooms. The meal tasted really good, and I managed to eat it all. I was left pretty stuffed. An average person probably wouldn't have been able to finish the meal, and yes I do eat a lot of food. The waitress was a nice lady. She was persistent is asking how our meal tasted. The only big thing that made this review a 3 star instead of a 4 star is the amount of time it took for our food to arrive at our table. It took a little longer than usual. Other than that, I would come here again in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=440

First it took 30 minutes to even be greeted by our waiter, then once he brought out the bread he disapeared and another waitress (who was very attentive and helpful)  took our drink order and food orders. Before our food came the waiter came back saying that the waitress was off, and he was back to being our waiter.  By the time our food came it was another 30 minutes for our party of 6 to all get our food. 3 of the 5 orders were wrong. My husbands pasta had no sauce, my sisters 5 cheese chicken pasta had the chicken barely cooked and my sister in laws cheeseburger was missing the bacon which took the waiter another 20 minutes to bring. The whole experince at this location was bad.  Not to mention the waitress who our waiter said was off, was not off she ended up being there and came over to tell us bye.

After finally being seated we ordered appetizers and entrees.  We asked for bread at least three times but that never arrived.  After no less than 45 minutes our entrees arrived.  About 5 minutes later our appetizers arrived.  The pasta was disgusting, the salad overdressed and missing several ingredients.  The pasta was cold and the salad was warm.  Whoops.

Being popularized by the show The Big Bang Theory and the fact that the original restaurant was developed by a couple from my hometown-Detroit, I really did want to like it. However after trying the San Diego restaurant twice, Las Vegas at the Forum in Caesars twice, and Downtown Salt Lake City twice, I've come to the conclusion that The Cheesecake Factory restaurants are just a pretty place to go for a piece of cheesecake and a cup of coffee - that's about it. There really is little to no substance to these restaurants. No soul as some may say. The food is always less than mediocre, and service is hit & miss. To add insult to injury, you then end up paying a fairly hefty cost for a less than mediocre experience. My suggestion is if you are craving Asian food, go to a good Asian restaurant, Italian, find a great Italian place, hamburger - the same. As well as seafood, Cajun, Mediterranean, and breakfast...

Maria H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,2.0,7/9/2015,"So let me start by saying I have always been a big Fan of the Cheesecake Factory. While visiting San Diego 7/7/2015 we walked across the street from our hotel to this location. We sat outside, simply lovely. Our waitress was supposed to be the very attractive platinum blonde lady  (don't know her name ) Well lets just say she acted as if we were invisible. She passed us several times and never greeted us. She assisted everyone else around us and continued to ignore my family of four. Finally about 20- 30 min later another waiter by the name Arturo felt sorry for us and assisted us. The food was great as always And Arturo was AMAZING.

I got a Stone and the wife ordered a Margarita.  Turned out to be the best part of the meal.  My wife ordered the Scampi and Steak Diane combo and added a side salad.  I asked how the Ribeye was and our server said it was excellent so I went with that, medium rare, but subbed the fries for a side salad. 15 minutes later our server returned to inform us that they had no greens and if it would be okay to make our salads with just romaine.  We said that would be fine as we had been there quite a while already.  10 minutes later she arrived with one salad.  The other would be there soon.  5 minutes later the other salad arrived.. They were both decent but hard to f-up a salad.  Our meals finally arrived.  My Ribeye was tiny and WAY overcooked.    The texture was similar to my Doc Martin.  Aweful!  My wife liked her Scampi and the potatoes were decent, but the Diane was really bad.  Probably could have used the steak medallions as ninja stars.  They were that tough and flavorless.  CHEESECAKE FACTORY-Don't sell steak if you suck at steak.  Stick to the overly sauced chicken BS.

But when we spoke to them we were told that they do not take reservations. So on the day of, we got to the cheesecake factory  at 5:00 pm and the group was not seated until 6:45 pm.

Asked for that famous bread that no one seems to get right away. We had to ask for it like 5 times and still didn't get it from our server. We had to ask another random lady that brought us our food if she can bring us bread, she brought it in like less then a minute. Let me also say that our food took forever to come, the lady and little daughter next to us got their food, ate, and left before we even got our food and we got seated before them. One of us asked for a refill of water, the server took the cup and never came back. Didn't have a drink for the rest of the meal. So we reminded him, where the refill was?? he acted confused, but finally brought it. At the end we ordered cheesecake to go. One of us was gonna pay for the meal, the other for the cheesecake. he ended up switching the cash and the card so the one who was going to pay for the cheesecake ended up paying for the overpriced meal, and the person who was gonna pay for the meal ended up getting the cheesecake bill. And might i add that he blamed us, said we messed up and put the cash in the wrong one. When in fact we made sure we didn't do that. Overall, he blamed the bad service on him having to wait on over 8 tables by himself. Poor guy, manager said he could've asked for help if he really needed it.

Did outdoor seating on a beautiful day, wasn't too hot, and the view of the harbor and skyscrapers are a plus. Really makes you feel like you're dining in San Diego. The service was awesome. Our server Christina (I hope that was her name) was super friendly, knowledgable, attentive, and such a happy person and a joy to be around. I really like those type of servers. Makes me feel like they really care about doing their job and giving their diners the best service. So you go girl! I usually get the chicken bellagio but I decided to try something new and I'm so mad that I didn't try the chicken Madeira sooner!! It's so damn good!!!! Better than the bellagio. Where have you been all my life?! Christina said it's very popular. It has 2 sautéed chicken breast with asparagus, melted mozzarella cheese covered with Madeira sauce, mushrooms and mashed potatoes. Words cannot describe how delicious everything was. Highly recommend this. If you haven't tried it, try it now. To end it all, I got the fresh banana cream cheesecake.

We both had a delicious dinner  together, when we were done eating we ordered some cheesecake. After that I was starting to get  really excited for the happy bday surprise ""Cheesecake Factory style"", I even had my camera ready. Well when our waitress Monica J. got to the table she had his cheesecake on a regular plate with nothing written on it with a candle that she lid in front of him said a unsincered happy bday and left. I was in sock, really didn't know what to say or do. Even my boyfriend mentioned something about it. Monica really ruined his bday and our special night together.

The hostess and servers have no customer service skills whatsoever. With that said, the ambience at this location is the same you'd find at others from this chain - which is nothing special despite it's great location. We started off with fried calamari. The calamari was decent but the sauces were straight up from a bottle. That ""garlic sauce"" was definitely tartar sauce and I'm pretty sure they carry that same brand at my local grocery store. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, it tasted like soy sauce and was really gross. My husband had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. He complained that the chicken was over-breaded but otherwise moist and tender. The portions were both large. I also had a glass of Moscato, not generously poured. My husband had Hennessy on the rocks and was given a pretty good amount.

We got there a little past lunchtime, around 1230 pm and only had to wait for about 10 minutes to be seated.  We received our drinks and bread right away and the waitress took our order in a timely fashion.  The problem is that the food got lost somewhere...45 minutes later, we were hunting down a manager to find out what was going on.  It wasn't the waitress' fault and she apologized a couple of times for the delay, so we didn't give her any grief.  But it was a business lunch before a meeting and we didn't think it would take so long.  By the time the manager brought out the food, we had to get the check so we didn't have to wait on that as well.  We only had 15 minutes to scarf down our food (which was great, but about lukewarm in temperature, which led us to believe it had been ready but sitting for awhile).  The manager was nice enough and comp'd our drinks, which saved us about $8, but it was disappointing to not be able to sit and enjoy the food at a slower pace. We told the manager we would return and we meant that.  I believe in giving people second chances, including businesses, so I'm certain I will eat at the this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego-3?start=520

Jessica L.,"San Diego, CA",5,5,2,2.0,3/15/2014,"This was our first visit to the Seaport Village Headquarters location. My husband & I are big fans of The Cheesecake Factory and frequent other locations. However, this was one of the worst restaurant experiences we've ever had. Let me start by saying thay I was a server for 7 years and have a lot of empathy for people in this line of work but this was just too much. First, I order the 4 cheese pasta with alfredo instead of marinara sauce. This has never been a problem before but he tells me they can't do it. He tries to explain but he's not making sense. Maybe there's something I'm missing but the only ingredients are cheese, sauce, and noodles, seems pretty easy to modify.  Anyway I tell him no problem, I will have something else instead.  Cut to 25 minutes later and we have just now been offered bread. Moments after he sets it down our entrees arrive. But wait, we ordered an appetizer, where is that? Wouldn't you know another 2 minutes go by and it shows up but we tell them we are already eating our main courses and don't want it anymore. They come back and offer to wrap it up to go and take it off of our bill, we say thank you. Next the manager comes up to apologize. He's very nice and we explain that we know it's a new location with presumably new servers and that everything is fine. And it would have been except things continued to go downhill. Neither of our drinks were refilled the entire time and when we finally paid our bill he ran it for the wrong table! Now I will be carrying a balance on my credit card for a couple of days until the void goes through. My husband and I smiled and didn't cause a fit because we both worked in customer service industries for a long time and didn't want to drag this poor kid through the mud BUT after getting home and seeing my take out (picture below) I had to write in. Granted, someone else packaged our appetizer (Thai lettuce wraps) and went we got home I noticed the sauces leaking ALL OVER the bag and onto the floor of our car. Well I open it up to see that instead of putting the sauce in plastic to-go ramekins they just threw the ones from the restaurant right in there with no lids! Who does that?! That's a huge cost for the restaurant and I'm SURE that's not the way they are supposed to package their to go items. Needless to say, we won't be going back. We were having a great day and as trivial as it seems, this put a damper on it.

ZERO preparation time but yet I waited 30 minutes after the first dish arrived?

After ONE HOUR AND TWENTY minutes, our food arrived. I had ordered the chicken enchiladas; they were cold when they got to me with a hot plate underneath them as if that was going to heat up the food. I called over the waiter and asked him if he could heat them up. He took the plate to the kitchen and 15 minutes later brought out what appeared to by my food except it looked like someone had eaten off the plate as the rice and beans were mixed together; mind you that I didn't even take a bite of those items. I was pretty aggravated and walked over to see the manager. The manager (Sean) stated that they were better than this and he was having a lot of issues with his servers and food preps.
