Chardá F.,"El Cajon, CA",259,261,53,3.0,9/19/2009,"I think the food here is awful, but if you want cheesecake it's awesome! I think that if you come here hungry enough you will eat the food but hence it IS called the CHEESECAKE factory for a reason. My two favs of all time are the vanilla bean cheesecake and the white chocolate shavings with raspberry sauce cheesecake. I also recommend going with something other than just plain cheesecake because it can be a bit pricey so make sure you go all out to get the most bang for your buck. I love cheesecake!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1340
Danielle S.,"San Diego, CA",235,179,14,4.0,1/10/2009,"This place always satisfies.  I love the thai lettuce wraps, they are the best of any I've tried.  The chicken madeira is my favorite dish; sauteed chicken breast , seared asparagus, mashed potatoes and a madiera sauce with mushrooms, very scrumptious.  The crabcake sandwish was good,not too bready, very good tasting crab meat.  Then there's the cheesecakes.  It's mind numbing the sheer amount to choose from, I love the pumpkin cheesecake, it's seasonal, and I don't like cheesecake all that much, but their is just the right amount of rich and mellow.  It's nice.  Parking of course blows and the wait is always atrocious but it's worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1340

Roberto B.,"San Diego, CA",71,116,,3.0,7/27/2010,"After reading several comments and postings, we wanted to try The Cheesecake Factory. Honestly, their food and service was not amazing as other postings. The food was regular not great, but I totally recommend to go to the outdoor seating because inside it is so load and people are walking right next to you all the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1340
M P.,"San Diego, CA",5,27,,4.0,2/12/2008,"I don't understand why people are complaining about the wait, and letting it affect their review so heavily.  They're just making a, ""damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" for Cheesecake.  It always has a wait because it is doing something right, but unfortunately people can't see past the wait to even get to what's causing it.   On the flip side, if they didn't ever have a wait in an area, such as Fashion Valley, it would probably be an indication on something very bad going on  Either way they are going to receive a bad review from these people.  Granted Fashion Valley is arguably the most popular mall in San Diego, so you can anticipate a crowd, but generally speaking, there are plenty of places to eat in Fashion Valley and the adjacent areas. CPK, Crocodile Caf (which never had a wait, but just closed down, hmm...go figure), Uno, Food Court, Nordstrom's Caf, 59th & Lex, Boudin, PF Changs, Zodiac, however none of these draw the popularity of Cheesecake for some reason, whether it be the trend, food quality, interior dcor, the public being mindless sheep, good service, strong drinks etc.  Something is causing it to have twice/three times the crowd as the other restaurants in the most popular mall in San Diego. So, to penalize Cheesecake for doing something positive which pulls an unusually large crowd is purely asinine. That being said, I would consider Cheesecake a high quality chain food restaurant.  Yes, it is a chain corporation and you can expect all the usual corporate chain practices: loud buzzers, hustle and bustle, etc.  However, Cheesecake is leaps and bounds above Chili's, TGIF, Applebee's, etc, types of places in terms of price to food quality ratio.  I would even go as far to say it has the same position over some, independent, so called, ""fine dining restaurants,"" in San Diego, which I often refer to as, ""painted rust."" The menu is huge, which is usually a sign of, ""jack of all trades, master of none,"" but I am still to have dish I was unsatisfied with.  So, if you're looking for pizza, steak, popcorn shrimp, or a club sandwich, you can find it here, and chances are it is better than most places you frequent, other than those secret SD spots you go for your favorite, best in San Diego foods. But you cannot deny the fact that his place always has a wait, but as I mentioned above restaurants are usually crowded because of good qualities, however, I am familiar with the term, ""over rated,"" but I think that term likes to be thrown around a little too loosely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1340

Jill H.,"San Diego, CA",0,78,,4.0,2/6/2012,"Well, if you eliminate the fact that there is not enough seating for the average one hour wait for dinner, you will not be disappointed!  I recommend avoiding Christmas season, but that's mall traffic, not the restaurant's fault.  I have had great food and drinks there, not to mention delicious desserts, most of the time.  As far as the tables, they are too close together, but the booths are awesome.  I am partial to this place, and they follow the standards of the chain.  However, I really do love coming here, but I usually reserve my visits for weekend brunch or lunch, because I don't like to wait more than 30 minutes:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1340

Adriana P.,"Chicago, IL",175,112,308,4.0,8/19/2010,"I'm not really a fan of this place cause I hate the extra large portions they serve and the wait. I practically never go but yesterday my friends and I watched Eat, Pray, Love at the movie theater before having lunch. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! The Italy part of the movie is all about delicious food so we  ran over to The Cheescake Factory before the credits were even done rolling.  We had the lunch specials.  The lunch serving is way more food than we needed.  I had the Orange Chicken and it was pretty good but the part that gives this place 4 stars is the CHEESECAKE. We ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. OH MY GOD.  This is the most delicious thing ever!!!!!!!!!!! The crust is soooo good and is almost like a chocolate cookie or just chocolate cookie crumbs, the next layer is THE BEST!!!  Chocolate Goodness! I am not sure if it is like mousse but thicker and full of little suprise chocolate squares!!!! OMG!! All this is covered with a layer of chocolate frosting that is just more delicious chocolate. If you are a chocoholic you must try this.  I swear that after all the times I talked shit about this place I am now a fan again. Next time I am NOT SHARING and taking this cheesecake to my house!

Auzon A.,"San Diego, CA",128,60,,2.0,3/10/2009,"I normally like cheesecake factory, in fact if i had it close to my house i'd go more often. However, i'm writing because if anyone is going to this cheesecake factory, i want you to beware of the shrimp pasta. It was served cold and 1/2 my plate was tomatoes. So i ate my 5 shrimp, all the pasta, & had a whole plate full of tomatoes. it was kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Sooo, note to self, dont order that dish. Everything else i've had is usually really good. All the other pastas, the chicken dishes, the appetizers. Also, if your from out of town, this place is a very long wait, usually about an hour.

Sarina C.,"Bordentown, NJ",4,19,,2.0,2/25/2009,"Eeeks. First off, the waiter was one of the most socially awkward individuals I have ever encountered. We ordered mimosas with brunch, but 10 minutes later he told us they can't serve alcohol till 11am. Then another couple was practically seated in our laps when the restaurant was wide open. Then the eggs benny came on a burnt english muffin with runny eggs and gross hollandaise. He never came back to check how the food was, probably due to his level of awkwardness. The french toast with strawberries was really good, but I wouldn't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1340
Harley G.,"San Diego, CA",0,135,26,5.0,4/24/2011,"The parking is plenty as this eatery is located inside a mall property. The wait time was no less than twenty minutes. Once seated, the server greeted the table and took drink orders. After taking drink orders and receiving drink orders the server came back quickly to take the table order. I ordered my usual Navajo sandwich which was requested to be cooked a special way. Usually this sandwich is cooked deep fried, but I requested it to be cooked by oven (baked sandwich). After the server told me she was unsure if this was possible I told her I've had it made this way before. She gladly told me she would check with the kitchen if this was possible and then check back with me. The server went and came and reported to me it was possible. I thanked her for her great customer service and enjoyed my meal. The server was great anticipating my needs and providing refills without me asking.

Steve H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,41,,3.0,3/4/2009,"If you're at the mall, you're hungry, and you don't want to leave just yet, the Cheesecake Factory will fill you up for a relatively low price with good food.  The lunch specials are where its at here, as you can get a personal pizza with a gigantic salad, or a (slightly) smaller version of one of their entrees that will fill you for about 10 bucks. Avoid the pasta; my wife tried two different dishes and they both disappointed. I give it 3 stars in the context of its location.

Diana M.,"San Diego, CA",5,17,4,4.0,8/1/2008,"I came here for the 30th year anniversary where the cheesecakes were $1.50! My friend and I decided to eat here around 2pm. It was crowded like a 20-25 minute wait. It wasn't too bad, we finally got our seats got the drinks, bread and waited for our food to be served. The pasta was great, and the cheesecakes were delicious! It sucks they ran out of tiramisu cheesecake. Everyone was definitely taking advantage of the $1.50 cheesecakes. Good thing we went around that time because after we finished watching a movie and got out around 6pm we passed by there and it was so crowded! It must have been an hour wait! Insane for a weekday.

Unfortunately, on a night we really needed luck, we waited forever for our meals! After I complained to our waiter, he sent the manager over to apologize.

WTF?!?!?! so he puts it in his mouth and goes about being loudly obnoxious like he's waiting tables at dave and busters and i lose my appetite as i watch him smack on his gum. we're ready to go... the girls are done eating and even though i've hardly touched my dinner, my friend asks for a to go box for us... the waiter is like ""i GUESS you can have a box"" smack smack smack ""can i interest you ladies in some cheesecake, coffee, or cappuccino?"" smack smack smack.... NO!!! i don't want to look at your greasy ass hair OR that huge ass piece of gum you're masticating while you're serving people their food!!! eventually we figure out who management was and pulled him aside to tell him about our horrible experience there... rain... the chicken lettuce wraps were not good at all... and our rude disgusting waiter needs to learn how to be appropriate when he is serving people.  we wound up getting our appetizer and the lettuce wraps knocked off the tab and we got a free slice of cheese cake, but i definitely don't plan to go back to the cheesecake factory for dinner any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1360
Scarlette F.,"San Diego, CA",179,48,5,3.0,3/4/2011,"So I had never been to Cheesecake Factory before, and after seeing how busy it usually is, I was expecting the food to at least be good. They don't accept reservations, so the wait was an hour and 15 mins. Since I was waiting so long I had a red raspberry martini that was tasty and had a decent amount of alcohol, despite it being $10 (I'm used to paying about $7 per mixed drink unless it has top-shelf booze). Once we sat down the service was great but the food wasn't. We shared the chicken samosas for our appetizer and they were very greasy and tasted a lot more like ground beef than chicken. For my entrée I ordered the kobe burger, it comes with mushrooms and onions. The mushrooms and onions were sauteed in some sort of very sweet, almost teriyaki tasting sauce that wasn't mentioned on the menu at all. It was so overpowering I could barely taste the beef and the entire bottom bun was soggy so I ended up using a fork and knife. My boyfriend had the fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes, it was actually very good. We decided to take home a slice of cheesecake. It was alright, but I have definitely had better, and for $6.75 it was a small slice.

We ordered the oriental chicken salad and the salmon special-herb crusted and it was delicious!  We also ended with the white chocolate raspberry and the celebration cheesecake. Both were amazing!  My only concern would be the wait time for food.

Danielle T.,"Irvine, CA",39,72,46,1.0,1/1/2018,"This place is a JOKE. There are so many other restaurants at Fashion Valley mall so just don't waste you precious time at this ridicules cheesecake factory location.  I'm way over disappointed with the bad experience I had.  We first came in at 8:15pm on MONDAY night. Asked for table for 6 (4 adults and 2 kids) told me to wait 10 minutes and will be sited, thought okay, 10 minutes it's ain't bad. Unfortunately the 10 came out to 20 minutes.  After we got sited it's took the waitress 5-7 just to come and even talked with us and than 5 more minutes to get some bread.  The silverware we've received were dirty I told that to the waitress he didn't even care about it. Asked for plastic utilities (which I didn't received; I needed to asked 3 times before I got it).  The waitress first took our order at 8:50pm. More than 30 minutes after we first came in!!  We ordered avocado egg rolls, 2 burgers, grilled salmon and edamame. Nothing complicated right? Lol. Not for cheesecake.  We waited more than 45(!!!!!!!!) minutes and even didn't receive all the dishes together.  First we received the grilled salmon, which was extremely salty and the mashed potatoes was COLD then after 3-5 minutes the two burger came out with NO fries, the fries came out only after 10 minutes. After we finished the burger.  But even after an hour the avocado egg rolls didn't arrived. We saw 2 other tables around us getting avocado egg rolls but for our table, nothing.  After asking the waitress couple of times about the egg rolls he didn't know what to say and just called a manager.  The manager also said he doesn't know and he will check this situation.  After 10 minutes came back said they run out from the egg rolls and he's sorry about it. Lol. 2 other tables (that set after us) received avocado egg rolls.  The reason we came to the cheesecake was because the avocado egg rolls and a cheesecake.  The waitress didn't inform us they doesn't have avocado egg rolls, the manager said they run out of it. I literally saw 2 other tables with the same dish at the table.  So the manager is a liar! He thought that if he will take if some $10 burger from the bill all will be okay. I didn't complained because I wanted my money back. My time with my dear family means the world to me. Because of the Cheesecake Factory this evening was ruined and we left without even having a desserts.  BTW dear manager, the $10 you took off I added to the tip so you can see it wasn't about the money. Even that we received a service that doesn't worth a penny!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego

The menu is huge, the portion sizes are big, the site is loud with big crowds, and very dim in the evening. (I watched them turn down the lights till you needed your phone light to read the menu) I used to love coming to TCF for work lunches- a great place where everyone can find something on the menu they like. And it does offer creative twists on american standards. But honestly, I don't think it's changed in 20 yrs.

Audra H.,"San Diego, CA",66,234,361,2.0,12/20/2017,"Blah. We wanted to enjoy this experience. We really did.  Upon arrival, I went to the front reservation desk and spoke with the hostess. I said, ""table for two"" and she replied ""15-20 minutes,"" and handed me a device that would light up/vibrate when the Table was ready.  My wife arrived shortly after parking the car. 20 minutes pass. My wife suggests we ask about time. We saw other people getting seated and we knew the 20 minute timeframe had passed. So....I go up and ask about our reservation. One girl says, ""let me check,"" and touches the computer screen. The hostess sees the screen, taps it once and says, ""it'll be 5-10 more minutes."" Confused, I walk away. Later on i realize I think somehow the first girl messed up and never activated our device for the table...boo. 5-7 minutes later we were seated.  However, not before hearing a hostess pick on our last name. She showed it to the two other girls from earlier that I had asked about our reservation and then proceeded to laugh and ask them, ""how do you say this?!"" One girl, (the most competent of the bunch in the time we were waiting) repeats how to say our last name clear as day, and correctly. The other laughs and says something about the show ""Stranger Things,"" and proceeds to come over to us to show us to our seats. What a crappy way to start our dinner. Laughing about a customers name? Shameful!!  I wish I could saw it gets better, but it doesn't. My wife orders Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style from our server (who was kind enough, just very busy). I order pasta and meatballs. Content, we close our menus and wait. About 5 minutes later, our server comes up and says, ""we're out of the Chicken Parmesan Pizza Style in the Kitchen.""  Wow. Strange. Do they freeze their food or something? How can they be out of chicken, Parmesan, etc.?! Does it come in a frozen package or something and that's why they're out of it?! I mean, we're at an Italian restaurant. It was disappointing to say the least.  My wife ends up ordering Crusted Chicken Romano.  The pasta and meatballs I ordered was just alright. The meatballs had plenty of flavor, (but were kinda hard in places--maybe they sat to long in a warmer, oven?) pasta was luke warm and not hot. Not something to call home about.  I tried my wife's dish. The crusted chicken was decent but the pasta was flavorless and it had very little sauce so this contributed to the lack of flavor.  I've been here before and the food was average--AT BEST.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego

If Chili's and BJ's is 5/10 quality Cheesecake Factory is an 8/10 and the prices are only 5-10% more. Value value value. You can ball on a budget at the Cheesecake Factory. 2. Their protein-oriented combo meals are an INSANE value. Choose from Steak Diane / Herb Salmon / Shrimp Scampi / Chicken Madera. served with mashed potatoes and some great sauces. $22.50 as of Q4 2017. 3. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.

Gloria T.,"Vista, CA",383,144,219,3.0,10/17/2017,"I love that more and more places are starting to offer Vegan friendly items. Makes for a happy party. If you look up ""How to eat Vegan at Cheesecake Factory"" on google, you will find a list of your options. The Vegan Cobb Salad is HUGE! It has: Crisp Lettuce Topped with Grilled Asparagus, Green Beans, Roasted Beets, Avocado, Cucumber, Tomato, Garbanzo Beans, Quinoa, Farro, Almonds and Sunflower Seeds. I called and asked about their veggie burger, if it contained egg (because of said list stated above). I was told that the patty does NOT contain egg but it DOES contain a chicken base........... Super misleading but I guess since it's called a ""veggie"" burger and not a ""vegetarian"" burger they can kind of get away with it? I don't know but that was a bummer and I am super glad I called and asked. We went to dinner on a sunday and only waited about 25 min which wasn't too bad but we did wait a little while for our food.

Deborah S.,"San Diego, CA",401,180,710,4.0,9/28/2017,"I never realized the Cheesecake Factory had such an amazing happy hour until recently. My husband and I were going shopping and decided to stop for a light meal. It so happened the Cheesecake Factory did not have a line and it was happy hour.  We decided to order the following appetizers the happy hour Burger, chicken sliders, avocado egg roll and the crab and artichoke dip. What we didn't realize was everything was the full portion size. When all the appetizers arrived it seemed as if we were eating for four people. Oh my goodness everything was so delicious. Avocado egg roll had a tantalizing tamarind dipping sauce. I swear if they sold this dipping sauce in the store I would buy gallons and put it on everything.  Next I moved on to the crab and artichoke dip which was rich, creamy and amazingly full of crap meat. The chicken sliders were juicy tender and came with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. Last but not least was the happy hour double burger. The burger was very large and juicy packed with flavor and cooked to perfection.  My husband and I enjoyed every happy hour item we had and left with a very large to go bag. I highly recommend the Cheesecake Factory for happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego
Kristine T.,"San Diego, CA",83,604,433,4.0,9/17/2017,"So my husband and I came here a week or so ago. We go to Cheesecake Factory all the time but this previous time was the worst. I have never walked out of a restaurant before but we did due to the service. It took over an hour and a half for our food to come out and we would have been fine if our waiter had checked in and kept us updated on the status but unfortunately, he avoided us! Not accidentally but blatantly avoided us. We would make eye contact and we were try and wave him down but he walked the opposite direction. We did speak to the manager Medi, who was very understanding and offered us some cheesecake or a meal on his next time we came. So a week or so later, we came back yesterday back because my mom chose it for her birthday dinner.  SERVICE - We asked for Medi and he remembered us. I have to say, Medi is a perfect example of a caring and kind manager. Someone who truly shows he cares about his patrons. He really apologized for our past experience and asked us how we were doing with our current experience. You could tell he was very genuine and wanted to ensure our experience was absolutely perfect this time around. Our server was TJ, who was awesome! He was witty and funny. He was fast and made sure we were taken care of. Even filled up our water before we asked. If you happen to have the pleasure of having TJ as your waiter, ask him to sing J Biebs and do a dance!!  FOOD Chinese Chicken Salad - Always our go to salad because it is so fresh with so much flavor. I always love the little tangerines in it giving it a juicy bite.  Louisiana Chicken Pasta - The fried chicken was very bland and dry. It was thin pieces of chicken so it could easily be over cooked which it was. The pasta noodles and sauce were just okay.  Honey Truffle Chicken - The chicken was well breaded and very moist! It had a very light taste of honey though. I wanted more flavor because the honey was too faint.  Fried Shrimp Basket - This was a solid dish. The shrimp was nicely fried without being overly greasy. The fries were perfectly crisp and salted.  Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken & Shrimp - This dish was slightly on the salty end this time around. My parents typically get this dish but it was saltier that usual. The white rice was very dry as well.  When it came time for the bill, it turned out Medi took care of our entire meal (including my parents and brother). We were not expecting that at all! We were taken by surprise but were also very appreciative. He even took the time to come out before we left to check if everything went well and said happy birthday to my mom. What a stand up guy!  Overall, Cheesecake Factory typically has good food! This time, it was just mediocre but I feel like it's not a normal occurrence.  3 STARS FOR FOOD 5 STARS FOR SERVICE",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego
Danielle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",697,664,404,3.0,11/21/2017,"This place gets packed on Sundays. We thought we were being slick and went in shortly after 3. Nope. They were still busy from Brunch Hours. Thankfully our party of 6 was seated in 20 minutes. We came at just the right time because when we left the wait was over an hour.  There are definitely not enough servers for the amount of people that come through here. The manager did his best and interacted with the patrons, but it was still a madhouse. My husband's food came out way before everyone else's. I would have preferred to have the kids food come out first, but it didn't.  It was our first time at this location and I could see that being in a mall was why they were busy. The good part about this chain is the variety of entrée items on the menu. There is literally something for everyone. And I haven't had a bad meal from a Cheesecake Factory that I can recall.  Oh yeah, parking here is a nightmare. If you can, try to park in the structure.

Thirty two minutes later our buzzer buzzed and we were seated promptly.  The food that was ordered was good -Trufle-Honey Chicken -Bistro Shrimp Pasta -Shrimp Scampi -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta The Trufle-Honey Chicken was yummy yummy. Good flavoring especially having a pinch of sweet from the Honey oh man. It came with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The Bistro Shrimp Pasta was yummy yummy too. It was a very large portion and flavorful. Spaghetti noodles were on point. Mushrooms and shrimps OH MY! The Shrimp Scampi seemed like the smallest portion of everything! Lol it is the perfect dish if you love jumbo shrimp and dislike pasta. Angel hair pasta in a nice and creamy garlicky buttery sauce and surrounded by 6! Jumboish Shrimps.  The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta is my first time ever eating Jambalaya with a pasta. It's a bit tomatoey. And with the old bay seasoning you know it's about to be legit right!  It had an ok amount of shrimps. Decent amount of chicken all sautéed with some good ol veggies.  For the birthday celebration you had to purchase your own dessert. They will decorate the plate and sing for ya.  When we were seated the table was a bit dirty.

Our server obviously knew what happened but decided to not acknowledge the problem, and simply serve us the food. Would have been nice if she simply apologized about it.  Both dishes tasted terrible being unevenly re-heated. The rice in the Miso Salmon were stuck together, the veggie in the Shepard's pie was cold.

Errin S.,"Santee, CA",56,30,42,4.0,11/26/2017,"For an upscale, but unpretentious dining experience, or even a few rounds of drinks with a date or some close friends, this is as well rounded as it gets.  It does get quite loud if you're seated inside, so either ask to sit outside or be ready for loud conversation. There's a full bar and a menu that covers just about every genera of food, all of course Americanized, but infused with flavor, presented with class and served in proportion to the price you pay. That price is a bit steep, so be ready to spend over $100 if you're going for appetizers, entree, drinks and dessert for two. I've often come and just gotten appetizers and drinks, which usually enough food for a small meal. Especially if you fill up on the fresh baked bread & butter they serve up complimentary as you wait. No matter what day of week or time of day you show up, there's always a wait and they don't take reservations, so be prepared.  If you don't have a large party, keep in mind that the bar (and a few tables in the vicinity) are open seating... meaning just stalk (politely and from a distance) someone who looks like they're finishing up and make a mad dash for their seats as soon as they're vacated.  Concerning their namesake... yes the cheesecake is amazing. I don't know that I've found anything to compare it to other than it's own internal competition... there are many varieties and all that I've tried are delicious.

Service was slow... slower than what I had figured to be normal in California.  No wait to sit. We did take forever ordering but I noticed parties who arrived after we placed our ordered, received their entrees before we did. The kitchen was ""slammed."" Almost an hour later we got all out food.  Maybe that's why my waffles arrived barely warm and raw. Raw.. The chicken they use is definitely not what I expected from cheesecake, it was hard to cut into and over seasoned.  Not one of us finished our entrees. The best part about our meal was the warm bread.  When our server Arman, asked how our meal was we informed him all our entrees were below par, since our previous CF visits have all been great. He quickly offered an ""I'm sorry. Should I bring the check?"" When everyone's entrees are barely edible, there is definitely something wrong.

While the wait can be quite long during peak hours on weekends, we usually like to eat a little earlier and get seated within ten to fifteen minutes of adding our name to the list. One of our favorite things is that until 5pm, the menu has a ""lunch special"" page that is offered. You can choose from a wide variety of items and they are not only discounted prices, but also a smaller portion which is something we like. I always feel like the regular portions are just way too big... But maybe that's just me! My go-to dish is the chicken piccata and it is offered during the lunch hour which is nice. It comes with angel hair pasta, chicken breast, and a lemon caper sauce with mushrooms. While many people may think I'm crazy for what I'm about to say next based on the fact that this is a review of The Cheesecake Factory, I make a couple modifications to the chicken piccata to make it a little healthier. I ask for rice instead of the pasta and, most importantly, for the sauce on the side. It's just as delicious and I never feel weighed down after eating it.

She was knowledgeable about the menu and any questions that we had about whether or not things had gluten. My mom had ordered a salad that she accidentally put salad dressing on that had gluten in it and she's allergic, and our waitress was able to bring her a new salad without hassle.  I really appreciate the service that my family and I received. We will definitely return to this location the next time we come back to fashion valley. There is really just so much to choose from on the menu everyone can get something they like. Even though I can't have the cheesecake, it sure looks delicious!

We were seated, drink orders were taken and we received our drinks as expected.  We ordered our meals, and our food took over an hour to get to our table, and only after we chased down our server.  I never saw a manager during our stay.  I walked around and looked twice, when our server was MIA.  Anyway, the food was great, and the only reason for the 3 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=20
Oli J.,"San Diego, CA",99,82,149,2.0,3/29/2017,"I am genuinely surprised I'm leaving a 2-star review for this place because I love the Cheesecake Factory. It's usually reliable, and cheesecake, am I right? No, skip this one! We came for an early dinner and got sat relatively quickly at a smaller table on the patio. We ordered drinks and appetizers. At this point, everything was fine, good even. It was an hour into our stay when we still hadn't gotten our entrees and our server said he had ""just checked on them,"" that we noticed something was wrong.  So when our food did come out, salad and pasta, by the way, we were happy to finally have our entrees. Except the quality was not as good as other CCF I've been too, though. Now, we were there, trying to recover from waiting an hour for subpar entrees, when the manager came out and asked the table right beside ours to move so they could make room for a 30 top group, and can you believe it, it was a group of teenagers! Not a foot away from us. The table that moved got a larger booth and free desserts, us? Suffer.  We got boxes, skipped the cheesecake (usually my reason for going here), and got out immediately. Our bill was over $100 for two people and I left 18% because I'm not a monster, but I do think the server forgot to ring in the order.

Andrea H.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",6,3,3,1.0,11/4/2017,"Worst experience I've had at this chain. My party was a total of 15 people and were told we couldn't get a reservation. So we got there at 6:30pm and was told it would be a 2 hour wait. By 8:30pm, we still had not been called and the host said they were waiting on 2 parties to leave to get our table ready. 9pm and still not seated. 9:30 and one party of 3 was still there preventing them to move our tables together.  That party was already done eating and bill paid. They were just chatting. I didn't expect them to kick them out or anything but asked the manager why couldn't he ask them to move to a different table if they still want to stay and chat. He said, ""I don't want to ruin their experience"". So our party was split into 3 tables surrounding this group who didn't look like they were leaving anytime soon. We got seated at 9:45pm, over 3 hours from when we got there! Most of us were hangry by that point.  I had to talk over the table to ask my friend a question and the server told me ""don't talk over the table"". So I couldn't talk to people in my party? Then right before we were about to order, one of the ladies in the party of 3 (who was sitting next to me) takes off her shoes and socks and starts massaging her feet! Who does that in a public restaurant? This really disgusted me! Two people in our party got the same dish and the noodles in the pasta were hard! They offered to comp those two dishes as a solution.  When they first sat us down the manager had apologized to us for the long wait and offered to comp us some cheesecake. We thought great we could all get some cheesecake for dessert at least. When dessert time came, turns out he could only offer us 3 SLICES of cake. 3 slices for a party of 15? That's crazy.  I understand that this situation was out of their control but they could have handled it better and their apologies didn't seem sincere. I have seen people being asked to move to a different table to make room for a bigger party and they didn't even bother to take that suggestion.  They kept repeating, ""we don't want to ruin their experience or yours"". But honestly, they were so worried about ruining an experience of 3 people that they ended up ruining an experience of 15 people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=20

Also the strawberry jam with Monte Cristo is very good, 5. The Bad: the Monte Cristo (only avail. on weekend brunch, so we had to wait until I had a weekend off) was served with cold eggs and soggy French toast, like it had sat out for 15-20 minutes before coming to our table. One bite and I couldn't believe it; I waited a long time for this and it had been so good on past visits. I just asked if I took out the eggs if they could bring a hot replacement, they did, so all was OK there. They brought a very large portion of eggs too. They tried, so 3.5 - 4. When placing the order I had asked if we could swap out the ham for a veggie, and they brought a large plate of spinach. It was good except there were two pieces that were obviously black and rotten. ???  2.

Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,389,860,3.0,4/16/2017,"Came here for dinner as the mall it's located at was just behind where we were staying for the weekend....so we didn't need to drive anywhere. I probably don't need to say too much about the Cheesecake factory as they're all decorated with the same theme.  Came here about 7pm and there was a huge crowd waiting outside the door.....now it was just a guessing game as to how long we had to wait to get a table. I went up to the check in counter and asked the guy how long a wait for two would be....he said about 35 minutes. No problem....thank goodness the mall is just there, so we were given a buzzer and went off to the mall to do some shopping to pass the time. On the dot, about 35 minutes later the buzzer went off and back we rushed. Thank goodness the buzzer worked all the way in the mall....as I was afraid it may have been out of range. Service was actually very good considering the place was totally packed inside and outside in the outdoor patio. We were kind of hungry so ordered a couple of appetizers to start....my usual CF Guacamole Eggrolls and the Chicken Samosas. And for mains I ordered the Skinnylicious Chicken Enchilada, and my friend ordered the Eggplant Parmesan.  My enchiladas weren't bad, but I thought red chile sauce was too strong and overpowered the taste of the enchiladas....secondly, the Escabeche Vegetable Salad didn't seem to go well with the enchiladas......it tasted like pickled vegetables you'd get at an Asian restaurant....I didn't enjoy this very much. I took a bite of my friend's eggplant Parmesan ad pasta.....it actually tasted yummy....the pasta was perhaps a bit dry though. Overall, our dinner experience here was just ok....nothing really wow'd us. However, most disappointing were the guacamole eggrolls.....the skin is supposed to be crispy, but outs was soggy. And, I do recall when the guac eggrolls were first introduced years ago, there was much more filling than what we got here tonight. The Chicken Samosas were quite good...but could have used more spice in the filling. Hmmm....not sure if I'll come back to this location....or if I do, I'll definitely have to order something else next time. Our server was really nice and friendly though.

Ashley E.,"San Diego, CA",53,455,2887,3.0,7/31/2017,"I've only visited a few times and to be honest I really only come once a year when the cheesecake is half off.   The portions size is very large but with that you can expect a larger price.  Unfortunately the quality and the taste do not support that price.  I've had pasta, pizza, salad, and recently the waffle benedict off their brunch menu.  My favorite item out of all of it is the free bread and butter.  The salad I've had was basically plain lettuce, it didn't have anything else but an OK dressing.  I wouldn't order again.  The pizzas are actually okay and might be worth the price.  The kids meal pizza is a good deal and my son loves it.  The waffle benedict I had was not very good.  The eggs were not cooked the same.  One was a firm gel consistency while the other was barely cooked.  The yolk spilled out instantly and the whites were barely cooked.  The hollandaise which is one of my favorite things was lacking in flavor.  The chicken was just okay but too was lacking flavor. The waffle was the only decent part.  The potatoes served with it were cut potatoes that were deep fried and they were way over cooked.  They were hard and pretty much inedible. Service is also nothing special.  This last time was the worst. The servers are not attentive with refills of drinks.  Our server took our order and then went to three other tables and took their orders. She then must have put the order in the computer reversed and because we got our food last and was over a half hour later.  Also when it came time to pay I received the wrong bill and guess what it was more expensive then my bill.  Seriously these waiters need to be trained.  Not one server even asked how my meal was.  It was very disappointing service.  The only reason I would give the Cheesecake Factory three stars versus two is the cheesecake.  I have tried the salted caramel, the 30th anniversary last year, the white chocolate macadamia, raspberry lemon, red velvet and heath.  I've loved everyone of those.  The only one I didn't care for was this year's celebration cake.  It was a little odd by my four year old loved it. I guess the only positive thing is the cheesecake other than that I don't particularly care for the Cheesecake Factory and will probably only visit when they run their yearly half priced cheesecake special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=40

I have had plenty of great servers but I have also had horrendous experiences where it makes me reconsider why I bothered coming in. There is little consistency with my experiences here anymore. I have even complained a few times, sometimes resulting in extra food, or partial comps or, nothing at all. Yes, nothing at all. I cannot express the need for such a busy store to have their best displayed and working here. It is because of the lack of consistency in service which is why I now go to other CF locations instead. I really hope they can fix that here but considering the revenue they probably get from this spot, it does not matter as much.

Wether it's for a birthday dinner, company meeting or if it's your fav spot most have been and have seen the menu... So I haven't been in many years as I was never a huge fan of their food. Visited the other evening for a bday and all I can say is that the menu is overwhelming! Not necessarily a good things as has you wondering how much of the product is truly fresh vs processed food? 2 pages of cheesecakes, 2-3 pages for apps/small bites, 2-3 pages of entrees yet only a small portion set aside for fresh items like salads or soups. This is from memory but  there were more pages that I can't recall. Most people  in  our group were nauseated​ by the amount of items. To be honest only found a small amount of items I would have grabbed(really only 2) but settled on the chicken wraps as I hoped they would be fresh enough for my taste. Butter lettuce, pickled cucumber(sweet though), carrots, 3 sauces(all sickly sweet), chicken(felt processed and was on top of it, sweet), bean sprouts, rice noodles and some cilantro. Price point was fine but with all the sugar loaded into the meal felt like dessert instead of savory. Other party members bout some food but all the plates were huge! One pasta dish looked as if it was a whole box of pasta on a plate! Not even exaggerating as she only managed to eat a 3rd of her plate before she was done. Customer service was good so I give them that, attentive and since we were a large party compromised of different groups the waitress knew we would all ask for separate checks and easily accommodated. All the cheesecakes listed, maybe 1 or 2 seemed appetizing but in the end since the app was so sweet didn't order any. My taste buds were still coated with sweetness from the app so no need for it. We stayed well past closing but were not rushed out, seated outside enjoying good company was a blast and why I'm rating them a 3. Food was not great but service was good so can't say anything too bad other then they need to minimize their menu and focus on fresher options to combat the multitude of sweetness they're putting out there. May come back for some of the drinks as they had a few that were very good. Not great yet not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=40

She truly left an amazing impression with her impeccable service and her positive, bubbly attitude. Okay, woman crush aside, the food. The food was really really good today. My mom and I ordered the calamari - it was seasoned perfectly, the calamari itself wasn't overlooked or anything. It was perfectly fried and at a perfect temperature. I have trust issues with calamari as it can be overseasoned, too battered and too fried, but today was excellent. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Delicious- hot, crispy breaded chicken with a right amount of heat. Even the thickness of the sauce was on par, as sometimes it's either too dry or too watery. I am thoroughly impressed.

Terri T.,"San Diego, CA",25,33,11,2.0,12/8/2017,"Yikes! This place is still serving the same crap it was 20 yrs ago. At that time I found it novel-  but time moves on! Their menu is as big as a dictionary (remember those?) with way way too many offerings for them to do any of it well. I'm always curious about the people who stand around and wait to get in. Overpriced food that comes in ridiculously heaping portions must have an appeal to some.  However, they do one thing very well- cheesecake. So if you are looking for a piece of good cheesecake run in and get some to go. You can't go wrong there. Too bad they didn't know to keep in line with their name ""Cheesecake Factory"". and forget about the terrible food they make.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=40

The table next door was keeping him very busy but he still never missed a beat. Service was perfectly timed, his food knowledge was impressive and he always had a friendly smile.

Katie, thank you for being such an amazing server yesterday, especially New Years Day. She was sweet, personable and asked if we wanted extra brown bread. On other days we would have politely accepted but we had to make room for our breakfast! Bryan ordered the monte cristo and I ordered the carnitas chilaquiles!

The menu dedicates 2 very own pages for cheesecakes. I try a different flavor every visit. There's so many to pick from and I always end up loving it each time. Last night I tried Chris's outrageous Cheesecake, layers of chocolate and coconut goodness. It's similar to a German cake. If you're a coconut lover this is the cake for you.  The wait can be long sometimes depending if you come in during lunch and dinner rush hours and how many people you're with. Btw they do not take rsvp!! My bf and I decided to take a risk and eat here on NYE for dinner. We got seated within 45 mins, surprisingly, a normal wait on a weekend for two during dinner. Customer service here is great! Servers are very friendly and always come back and check on your table every once in a while.  I always end up getting pasta dishes because the portions are huge! You pay for what you're getting. My regular is the pasta da Vinci, penne pasta with chicken and mushrooms. I tried the Louisiana chicken pasta and that was good too. It was nice and creamy with a kick of spice and the chicken was nicely breaded and had a crunch in every bite.  My bf has the Jamaican black pepper shrimp served with rice.

I'm so happy for the one at North County mall in Escondido now though because this one seems to be going down hill.  We walk in during the middle of the day on a Wednesday and still have to wait for a table. Its just two of us and we were willing to sit outside but it's fine. I'm used to waiting here. What I am not used to is how dirty it was inside.  The hostess sits us at a table that still has bread crumbs on it that  she clearly had to see when she placed the menu on top of them.  My knife had a piece of lent on it and then when we were given our forks and napkins for dessert there was a giant hair on the white napkin as clear as day. The waiter walks away and as he sees me reach for another fork from the many empty tables around us he asks if we want another fork. Uh, ya, and a napkin please.

Seriously so much to look at and so many decisions to make. Although be aware that the wait time here can be long, sometimes up to an hour depending on party size. They also have indoor and outdoor seatings, and more than one location, but this one is central San Diego. Bistro Shrimp Pasta (Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce.) It was a huge portion, and everything tasted fresh. It was delicious. Fried Macaroni and Cheese (Crispy Crumb Coated Macaroni and Cheese Balls. Served over a Creamy Marinara Sauce.) A super delicious appetizer! Came with four fat pieces.

The sliders were delicious!  I don't know what kind of beef, or how they season it, but the meat was truly tasty!  Cooked to perfection, and just enough ketchup without overwhelming the taste of the meat. Would return just to eat more sliders . My compliments to the chefs/cooks.

I use to take my girlfriend here all the time because she loves the cheesecake, we typically would have to wait for about an hour to get a table which was worth it to see her happy. The food was always good and service was great too until they started promoting their national cheesecake day. They told us that on National Cheesecake day all Cheesecake was half off. They didn't tell us that it was just one per person. I go their to get my girlfriend 5 slices and after waiting for over 30 minutes they told me it's only for one slice. I am very unhappy with this misleading promotion especially after the server told us we can get as many as we wanted.

Chelsea S.,"Orange, CA",45,287,,4.0,2/6/2017,"This place is exactly what you would expect from The Cheesecake Factory: delicious food, good service, and a great environment. The wait time (at 2 in the afternoon, mind you) was a half an hour or so, which was a little annoying but completely to be expected since it's in Fashion Valley. The place was packed but for whatever reason there were a number of empty tables both inside and out- maybe they didn't have enough staff? Our waitress was very sweet and did a great job even though she was clearly hustling running back and forth between tables. I went with the gumbo because I'm physically incapable of resisting anything that has andouille sausage in it, and was blown away with the flavor. The meat was great quality, and the broth had a rich, spicy, buttery flavor that was just fantastic. Put together with the pile of rice it comes with, I was in complete gumbo heaven. Dessert was a Hershey's cheesecake, but being completely honest, the gumbo made me much happier. One of the nice things about this location is that it has such a large patio. It's less crowded and noisy than indoors, and on a warm Saturday afternoon it was the perfect place to enjoy a meal. The parking can be tricky since it's in Fashion, but if you actually find parking this is a great place to get your fix- because the menu is enormous so there's really nothing you could want that isn't on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=60

As we waited for our food, TJ gave us bread with butter. Our food came out in 15 minutes. Fairly quick for a busy restaurant. My margarita was good and strong. I had a glass of water to drink after drinking my margarita. The salmon was cooked to perfection. Mashed potatoes were flavorful and tasty. Broccoli needed more flavor but cooked well.  TJ was a great server and very attentive. He gets 5 stars for customer service. He made sure our drinks were refilled. He tried to get us to have dessert but we were stuffed cause servings were big.

However this time the cheesecake tasted terrible. It's as if they missed the sweener, or the vanilla extract.  I'm not sure, but it tastes bland as ever. And when I say bland, I mean the cheesecake portion of the actual cheesecake...the cream cheese, when I put it in my mouth it was as if it was tasteless. You want to tell me that I paid what, 10 bucks per slice, to taste nothing? What a joke.  What are you trying to do, water down the cream? That's so irresponsible. People pay good money for this! Why would you allow something so nasty leave  your kitchen? I let 3 people try it, I didn't say anything...guess what? They all spit it back up asking what the f*ck was that? So now I'm stuck asking you? Postmates will not refund the order, so basically you just swindled me out of my money....? Great! Awesome. You might have saved money by watering down the cheesecake  but you just lost one of your loyal customers in the process.  I'm officially over this restaurant. 3rd time this year. Once, I can deal with, but 3 times  insinuates a problem. I'm going to go back to ordering my $5 cheesecake from other places because there is no need to be paying premium prices for premium cheesecake, that taste below average. #SimplyUnacceptable",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=60

My new experiences were much more positive.  The breakfast omelettes are actually quite good and I will attest to very good fresh juices. Also they have some very fresh tasting lunch entree salads.  Even my wife, who has an obsession with natural fresh food gave it thumbs up, a rare endorsement. As for why I didn't give it 5 stars, it's because there are some items that feel rather mass-produced.  Some of the desserts for example.  It's to be expected in a large and very busy restaurant.  Maybe I'm being a bit unfair looking for a home-cooked feel in a high traffic restaurant at the front entrance to a busy mall.

The food was good, not great. The free bread is yummy, probably because we were starving. Servings are generous. My pork chop entree was fine, but the mashed potatoes were barely warm and the green beans were slightly overcooked. My guess is the food had been sitting on the counter for a few minutes.  Overall, probably 3-1/2 stars, but will round down a little bit this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=80

We sat on the patio near the door....and here comes Shelby.. yelling out two employees that were following her (I need you two to hurry up...that's what I need you to do)..attitude and all..SMH. We did let our server know as well as the Manager. He stated he would talk with her, however she still had a stank face going on while we were there. That leads me to think Shelby was probably the Manager's side chick or something???? On top of the bad service..we ordered Sangria's at 11.95 ea... I did not taste a lick of alcohol...NOTHING!

We sat outside and OMFG why have I never dined outside before?! IT'S SO DAMN NICE! It has such a  romantic feel! They have plenty of heaters outside so no need to worry about the weather. I love it at night! Perfect for a date setting. I was starving and I ordered the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo $21.95 WHAT A STEAL WHAT A DEAL! IT'S SO DAMN DELICIOUS! It's the first time I ever ordered either of those. I usually get the fried mac & cheese ball (also  ) but I'm so glad I tried something new. I've been liking steak ever since I went to Ruth's Chris. The sauce for the shrimp scampi... OMFG make me drool! YES, BABY! PLEASE GIVE IT TO ME! Maridel A. got the loaded tots and it was really good! It comes with a side of sour cream.

Steve F.,"San Diego, CA",916,1167,5947,4.0,2/25/2016,"""CONSUME MASS QUANTITIES!"" That quote from Coneheads best describes how I feel whenever I stop by The Cheesecake Factory chain - large portion sizes from a menu that has almost every type of cuisine so loaded with calories that you need to walk your @$$ around the block a few times afterwards to burn it off.  But, when the food tastes that good, it's almost worth it! We came here a couple of nights ago to treat our mom to a belated Valentine's Day dinner.  While there's no same-day reservations offered, it's a good idea to have someone get here early to get a buzzer before the rest of your party gets there (which is what I did, seeing how I work relatively close by).  After about a twenty minute wait, we were seated and eventually made our choices (as I mentioned, that menu has almost everything but the kitchen sink). My mom ordered the Chicken and Biscuits, my brother went with the Pit Beef Dip (similar to a French Dip with au jus), and my choice was the Kobe Beef Burger.  While my mom liked the gravy with her dish, and my burger was pretty juicy (the grilled onions and mushrooms helped... even though the dressing was on the side, my burger didn't really need it), my brother was kinda disappointed with his sandwich.  Even though he finished it much to mine and our mother's surprise, he thought it was a bit on the dry side.  The tableside bread that we got prior to our orders also helped fill us up - it was pretty warm with a chewy crust, though I felt that the sourdough was better than the wheat. And of course, the dessert.  If there's at least one good thing that The Cheesecake Factory does really well, it's the myriad of cheesecake choices to choose from.  My mom went with something simple - the classic cheesecake with strawberries - and after one bite from each of us and the realization that it was very rich and sweet, we were done.  What's left of the cheesecake slice is still in the fridge, tempting us... Though the music was a bit too loud (even when the dining room emptied a bit during dinner service, it seemed like it was at full blast), the ambiance is surprisingly comfortable.  Our server did a great job checking on us, bringing us our orders, and refilling our water glasses.  Interestingly, The Cheesecake Factory has its own merchandise; while the stuffed animals seemed a bit cliché, the pins had my interest piqued. As there's a happy hour between 4-6pm (where hopefully the fried calamari is a $5 app option), as well as a Sunday brunch where the Crab Hash is calling my name, think I'll keep this chain in mind for next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=100

For some reason I always have the ""luck"" of being sat in this one horrible waitress' section with my family.  She is the WORST waitress.  She never fills our drinks and never gets our food out to us in a reasonable amount of time.  As a waitress, your job is to make sure your tables' orders are progressing.  You shouldnt always have your appetizers come out after your entrees.. or forget items.. but last night was the final straw.  I should have asked to be moved but I had no idea I was in her section until our original waiter took a break right after he took our meal order 35 minutes after we sat down. I have children and they ordered the most simple item on the menu.  Bowtie pasta with butter and cheese.  Doesnt get much easier than that, huh?  Why seat me if you cant even take my drink order for over 20 minutes and it takes 35 to even ask me what I want for dinner?  Why offer to place the children's orders first if you are going to bring out my child's order 22 minutes TWENTY TWO FREAKING & MINUTES after the rest of our table.  CF cant boil an entire new batch of pasta in 22 minutes?  What kind of restaurant doesnt have childrens bowtie pasta which makes up 60% of the childrens menu ready within minutes??   So after almost 2 hours at the cheesecake factory I ended up with a completely lost appetite because my food was cold by the time my child's was delivered and I wasnt going to just sit there and eat in front of my very hungry child.

I ordered the Shephard's Pie, and although it wasn't as I expected, it was actually very delicious.  Their rendition comes in a deep plate, but not in a ""pie"" dish.  Definitely more presentable than what we'd expect usually. The Dulce De Leche cheesecake was perfect.  Not too overpowering.  Great suggestion from our server. Just a few FYI's: - The menu is fairly extensive.  One of the pages is full of chicken dishes.  They even have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu insert, which takes specific items on the regular menu and puts it all in one place for the health-conscious customers.  It's their way of responding to the concerns of their cuisine being somewhat on the unhealthy side as well as plentiful. - Prices are a bit higher for what they offer.  However, it can be said that you get what you pay for.  Higher prices for larger portions. - They do not take reservations.  And for good reason too.  They get mobbed on a regular basis.  They're better off seating people who are physically there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=120

Ros A.,"University City, San Diego, CA",540,269,761,3.0,1/1/2016,"The food is good at Cheesecake Factory. There most likely will be a wait to dine as well. My review is based on a recent dining experience.  We opted to sit outside mainly for the shorter wait time, but also for fesh air and it's not as loud as the inside can get. When we sat down we were seated near a heat lamp which helped.  I regrettably didn't get our servers name, as this review is based mostly on the service. After we ordered, the sun moved and it was shinning right on my mom's face. Even with sunglasses on, it wouldn't have been the best experience to have the sun right on your face. We asked the server if we could move to a different table outside that didn't shine right on us (and perhaps I should have asked the hostess instead). He turned our table just slightly and instead of the sun shinning right on her face it was right up against the side. This made us right up next to the chairs for the table behind us. This didn't help and it didn't seem as if he was willing to move us, so we switched seats.  To eat, I had the California avocado salad and I asked for the dressing on the side. When our food came, my salad came but no dressing. I asked for dressing. I told everyone to start eating as my dressing would soon be out. No dressing came and our server didn't even come out to check on us. No where in sight. Everyone started to slowly stop eating as I hadn't even started as and they were half way through. I got up and looked around the patio for our server. No where. I went inside and looked around where the kitchen was. No where. Finally another server saw me looking around and asked if I needed something. I told her I hadn't gotten my dressing and she said she'd bring it right out. At least she was willing to help.  Finally I get my dressing and I can eat. The food at Cheesecake is consistent and most of the dishes are good.

Lisa G.,"Poway, San Diego, CA",824,404,3500,4.0,12/18/2015,"Dropped by here for a company dinner yesterday. Felt a bit bad as we were one of those large groups and we ended up having to wait a half hour to a hour after we were seated as our main people for the night were stuck in traffic. The waiter was very sweet and patient though our group was a bit loud and bickering in Chinese. We ended up ordering some appetizers first and making small talk until the entire group arrived. My to go to at ANY Cheesecake Factory is the Buffalo Blasts and the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I went to the one in Long Island back in NY a lot so I knew what I was getting myself into. Buffalo Blasts had chicken and cheese combined together within a crispy outer layer that you could put some blue cheese or hot sauce in to make a delicious medley in your mouth. Almost like some fireworks. But yes, that is my favorite to get. Thai Lettuce Wraps was another one of my staples to get as it is light and easy to digest. Just put everything in the lettuce and wrap it. Wa-lah~. Other appetizers like the fried calamari and the avocado eggrolls were pretty good too. Fried calamari is like at every food place - so pretty much self explanatory. Avocado eggrolls were nicely toasted when coming out though the display on one of the ones that came out clearly stated that it was rushed. But hey, food's food! I tried the Steak Diane (a piece of it from my coworker's place) later on - and must say, that is a pretty delicious piece of meat. Cheesecake Factory knows what they are doing! I was way too full to finish my Shepherd's Pie but my cousin finished that once I got home so I would say it was good. Service was on point - only not so good thing is that they don't take reservations. Heard from my coworkers who left early to score us that spot that they were waiting for quite some time while everyone else tried to beat rush hour traffic. Would most definitely recommend to anyone whose craving something not too upscale and not too casual - but maybe in the middle. For groups though, might be a tight fit at seating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=120

Sylvia H.,"San Diego, CA",56,147,1274,4.0,1/11/2016,"This place is always pretty busy, probably because its popular and being located in Fashion Valley Mall, which itself is always busy, doesn't help. Came on a Sunday around 6pm and was told it would be 15 minutes, but was seated within 10! It is a bit loud, but we were seated in a corner by the window, so it was nice, quiet and intimate. The seats were comfortable. There is also a large outdoor patio. There is lots of room for large groups. Its pretty casual for a sit down place and seems totally kid friendly.  Our server, Lymn, was really friendly, quick and attentive. He explained everything and answered all of our questions thoroughly. Nothing went wrong with our order and he fulfilled all our special requests. He's definitely one of the better waiters I've had in recent memory.  The menu here is huge and very varied. Its best to come somewhat prepared knowing the general ""category / type"" of food you are looking for so you can narrow it down a bit. There is a Skinnylicious (lighter choices) menu too, which is nice, especially considering this place is known to be a calorie bomb. The complimentary bread was nice. The sourdough was dry and too crunchy, though. However, the honey wheat bread was so good. It arrived warm and a bit crunchy on the outside but soft and the inside. Worth the trip, right there. Our food arrived quickly, hot and fresh.  I had the MEXICAN CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAP TACOS ($6.95) from the Skinnylious and Starters/Small Plates Menu.  Butter Lettuce Leaves Filled with Grilled Chicken and Avocado, Tomato, Onion, Cilantro, Roasted Corn Salsa and Crema. I asked for extra butter lettuce and boy did they deliver; it felt like I almost got a side salad (very fresh one at that). The chicken was perfectly grilled and flavorful. There were only about 5 good sized pieces, so its a lighter meal, but still filling. There were huge chunks of perfectly ripe avocado. The salsa was well spiced and flavourful, with the cilantro and lime being prominent. The crema sauce on the side was not as spicy as the salsa, but well seasoned. Overall, it was a great tasting meal with good quality ingredients and a good value.  My friend had an appetizer (BEETS WITH GOAT CHEESE Fresh Beets, Apples, Baby Arugula, Pecans and Vinaigrette from the Skinnylious menu $6.95). The beets were nicely cooked, but there weren't that many of them. There were generous portions of goat cheese though. Her entree was the CHICKEN BELLAGIO (Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad). There was a large portion of prosciutto, but it was cut rather thick which is odd. I didn't try this, but it looked good and  she really enjoyed both her choices. She took 1/2 her entree home; the portions are really substantial.  Overall, if you don't mind a bit of noise and wait, the place is comfortable, the service was great and the food quality, taste and value are really good. I'll definitely be back to try something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=120

Sheryllyn E.,"Newport Beach, CA",441,243,1052,4.0,7/5/2016,"Not bad for a busy Sunday night, the crowd was around and waiting, but the wait for a family of 5 was 15 minutes, I had expected longer. The cheesecake display was already making me hungry that I was deciding right then which one to take home. My family got the calamari and avocado rolls to start. Calamari was brought out warm. Some pieces were tough and felt it was battered a bit too much. They forgot lemon, so be sure to ask them. Table set up was off because they had sat us in a booth. Wish the servers paid more attention to the diners and space. The booth was small and I was in smashed in the corner by my two brothers but luckily I'm a small girl. So, table space was small trying to accommodate 3 drinks and 2 hot teas.  Bread came in fresh and the butter was really cold. Speaking of cold, the AC was blasting but I think they had no control over it, it was perfect temp for the servers though who were always moving. AC had eventually stopped which made eating for enjoyable. Avocado rolls were next, there was six pieces and it was chuncky and crunchy fresh delicious (I could've ate my own) So I got Evelyn's pasta with angel hair. I wish there was more veggies, there is no meat in it but the pine nuts made it hearty good. There was eggplant, zucchini, and olives that stood out in the dish. My older brother ordered shrimp with beans and rice, it was supposed to come with plantain which he was looking forward to, but was informed last minute that they were out. He was disappointed. I wished the server had checked on the ingredients in stock prior to the dish coming out. The server had already come with his dish and informing plantains had run out (assuming cuban dish) it lacked in character for both food and service. Very poorly executed. Other dished turned out fine, the chicken piccata looked great and the salmon with mashed potatoes looked very good.      Despite some set backs in the food and service, dining with family made it better. We had a good time and ended up taking cheesecake slices to go. The lemon meringue was delicious. Kona coffee wasn't too sweet and the dolce leche tasted rich and creamy. Perfect ending!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=140
Catherine V.,"San Diego, CA",34,36,10,2.0,7/12/2017,"So I've been a regular at the Cheesecake Factory for a couple of years now. The first time I went I was blown away by how beautiful the setting was, and how delicious the food tasted, not to mention the service was fantastic. After that, I was hooked. However, ever since then I have only experienced sub-par of the aforementioned. Let me give a few examples of how they missed the mark.  1. Curbside mess: I asked for extra sauce for my pasta and a smoothie. They brought out the food and I looked inside the bag to check the order. The sauce cup had vent holes in the top, and the sauce was leaking. I brought it to the girls attention and she said, oh sorry about that, then it was like paaaauuse. Soooo, instead of her offering to take the bag in and clean it up or offer anything for that matter, I asked her for some extra napkins. She brought the napkins and it took like three of them to clean it up, and now my hand were kinda messy, then I handed her the dirty napkins, of which she didn't look too happy about. What else was I supposed to do with them?? Then when the girl brought out my smoothie, when she was handing it to me it was tilted and it leaked all over my hand, legs, leather seat and car door. Luckily I had leather seats that could wipe& I was wearing shorts cause I much rather it got all over my legs than if I was wearing pants because I had a lot of errands to run that day and didn't want to walk around with stained pants. I was pretty upset about all that at this point. I asked to speak to the manager and he didn't do much but apologize. I wasn't wanting anything for free, but I got a clear feeling that he didn't care. But, the food was good so I let it go and returned. 2. Hostess fiasco: I haven't seen my mom in a while and it was the first time she'd visited me since moving to SD in 09. Well the hostess asked us if we wanted outside or inside. We said whichever was faster. So when we got called, it was to a table outside. It was a chilly night out so they had the heaters on outside, however the table we were at didn't feel heated at all, and my whole family thought so too. The hostess seating us could clearly hear us talking about how cold it was, but instead of offering to move us to another table, she was rushing to put down our menus so she could walk away, so right before she left I asked her ""Excuse me, can we please move to a table that's a little warmer? It's really cold here."" And looking annoyed, she said ""okay, you guys can come and wait at the host stand until something opens up."" So I said, ""well can't we just wait here? There's a table right there next to the heat lamp, can we just wait for that to get cleaned up?"" And she says looking further annoyed, ""Well, I have to check with the host stand first, because someone else might be waiting for that table. I'll be right back."" So we sat there for couple of minutes, then the server came by and said ""hello, what can I get started for you today?"" We said ""we're waiting for another table, it's too cold here, like that table."" And politely he said, of course! So he cleaned it off and helped us move over. Now I was concerned because the hostess hadn't come back in about 5 minutes. But I knew that she would be okay if another guest came cause our cold table was open. She never returned, an entirely different hostess came and looked really confused because the tables were switched. Needless to say the people sat at that table looked cold the whole time.  3. Curbside poor food quality: Now I always order the exact same thing. This time they got the sauce right, but all the food tasted like burnt plastic. I was so bummed, because I was so hungry but the food was so bad I couldn't even eat it. Also, I was quoted 20-25 min, and it took about 40 minutes. I called the manager the next day and he gave me a refund. That was nice of him.  4. Curbside, never again!: So before catching a movie, the fiance and I were ordering take-out. I order my usual with extra sauce, the bread (asking for dark bread only), asked for extra napkins/utensils and two complementary waters. When the girl arrives I checked the order. No extra sauce, the bread was brown AND white, just 3 napkins (which is the usual), and no waters. So I politely say ""I didn't get the extra sauce, can I please have some. And can I please have the waters, more brown bread and extra napkins."" Then she said, ""The extra sauce wasn't in the container?"" I politely said ""no, I just checked."" Then she asks, ""You want a water?"" And I replied ""I ordered two waters."" So promptly, she brought out the two waters, bread and sauce. So my fiancé and I sit down to eat and I opened the bag with the sauce in it, and it's spilled everywhere! The sauce was all over the bag, and the bread, and now all over my hands and it dripped on my clothes. I was pissed. My fiancé went all the way back and got some more sauce and bread for me.  About 50% of the times I go, something awful happens here. No longer a regular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=140

Cheesecake Factory is the kind of corporate restaurant at every corner, almost like a Starbucks, except it's calorie count is well over double that of a Venti Caramel Frapp with extra whipped cream.  Most of Cheesecake's meals are well over 1500 calories....  Thankfully they now have the ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  The real deal is the portions are smaller ...(I mean just right ...)There are some tasty items including the turkey burger , and some salads and pastas. But ... How could you ignore the regular menu and the free batches of white hot sourdough or wheat bread and butter?  Their menu consists of something for everyone...appetizers, Asian food , breakfast, burgers and big salads, soups and soul food (chili and jambalaya ) and my favorite page of the menu...12... Pasta !  Pasta favorites include Louisiana chicken pasta and the garlic farfalle. For you simple but garlic lovers, the spaghetti with marinara is off menu but absolutely tasty and delicious. Off of page 12, includes one of my pasta favorites ...Chicken Bellagio. It has a basil pesto pasta with a cream sauce underneath , foreign ham to top, arugula and two big slabs of thin crispy tender chicken that I can never finish.  A non pasta other favorite is the chicken n biscuits. Yup.  Favorite appetizers so far are the Mac N cheese Balls and the Avocado Egg Rolls. Must try!!! The line is exceptionally long (30 minutes plus) over the weekend , but hey grab a pager and go shopping. There is a nicely remodeled heated patio that sometimes is warmer than outside (and much quieter). Service is friendly and knowledgable , never had an issue.

Consistency in guest service is definitely lacking, also overheard a handful of the employees cussing in the restroom regarding their shift times as they wiped down the counters and water from the floor.   Experiences here are very hit or miss.

He was kind, efficient and good in all ways, and he stated he had only worked there for three days. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breasts, which I love. The menu is very broad and there is always something you want to eat. At one point, when Dan was not there, my knife fell to the floor. At least 20 employees passed over it without comment, with one waitress giggling to another server ""It looks like the customers are messy tonight!"" as she looked down at the knife and kept on walking. Finally, I think it was Brian who happily retrieved the errant knife. I mentioned it to Dan, and manager Jessica Darlington came over and we had a nice chat about the restaurant.

LeChonne W.,"La Mesa, CA",112,71,206,1.0,8/7/2017,"I thought I had reviewed them a while back but perhaps not. It was Jan 1 and a friend and I had gone in. The entire experience was bad from start to finish. The customer service (waiter claimed to be new) was atrocious and the food was really bad this day. Long story short the manager on duty came over and eventually it was settled...for the bad experience he was sending us gift cards. I had no huge inclination to return but because I had the gift card I decided to go spend it. Another friend and I dined here this past weekend. I wish I could say it was a great time. I cannot understand how people love the food here now that I have been back. Maybe it was good at some point, maybe each time it is what I order (which doesn't account totally for the bad service) but this place is not good. The young wait staff we got seemed a bit attitudal to me. Her comments back to me in the beginning of the ordering process was not CS worthy but I went with it...let it be what it was and in the end she turned out eh, ok. The food however was not good. I ordered the  LARGE shrimp and pasta. Shrimp wasn't large and the pasta was flavorless. I had to order extra sauce to make it decent. My friend ordered the Jambalaya with chicken and shrimp and only got the chicken. Whaaaaaat! How you just forget a entire protein? She did say that the taste was good (she salt and peppered it though). Once requested, they did give her the shrimp she should have gotten and she added it to her TO GO box. Next table over, I noticed that the same ""new waiter"" that caused the big issues back in Jan for me and another friend was working the table next to ours. He hadn't improved one bit. The couple ended up in the same situation. The HE got his food and was eating it. The SHE did not get her food until WELL after the HE got his food, he ate it all, the plate was removed and then she got her food. I felt really sad for them. Who wants to go out to eat with someone and not actually get to EAT with them. I heard that same waiter making the same excuses he had made with me and my friend at the beginning of the year to these folks. He obviously did not learn a thing in 8 months.   2 other things to note:  1. The cocktails on their menu do not show a price. You list pricing with wine but not with cocktails. When I asked our waiter about it, she was like they range from 7 to 13 dollars and it is obviously a surprise or a secret until you order. It seems a bit shady that they do not list the cost of their cocktails. Spirit is one of the things that seems like it would be easy to price in a restaurant. My wait person got an attitude when I asked her how much the cocktails were.   2. It was a birthday celebration is why I decided to go and use the gift card. I didn't want desert but my birthday friend, accepted the birthday dessert which you would think at the CHEESE CAKE FACTORY it would be a small cut of cheese cake. Nope!, it is the tiniest cup of generic ice cream you can imagine. So small in fact, I wonder why they bother. So cheap with themselves that they do not even offer their name sake signature item as a reward or gift for dinning there on your special day. I personally will never bother to return to the CCF again for all these reasons and a few more I am not going to go into cause why....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=140
Jennifer H.,"San Diego, CA",9,134,580,4.0,1/16/2016,"Who doesn't like the Cheesecake Factory?!  The restaurant has fantastic cocktails and excellent food. Yeah, it is busy and loud and you usually have to wait but it is well worth it. I have recently started coming after work and sitting at the bar. I get more attention from the bartenders and everything comes quicker. Helps I am by myself but that is a different conversation.  I am a cocktail girl. No wine, no beer. Hard liquor all the way. My drink of choice is Ruby Red Sunrise.  Tito's Vodka, Fresh Grapefruit Juice, Lime and St. Germain Over Crushed Ice. This is a GOOD cocktail. This is the closest I have found to my all time favorite drink the Frenemy from the now closed Fish Public. I love St.Germaine.  I love that CCF has happy hour! Last night, I enjoyed the Chicken Potstickers and Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip with bread. Yummy!  The portions are a hefty size. Usually end up taking some home.  The hardest part about coming to CCF is deciding what to order. The menu is so extensive. If you don't know what you are in the mood to eat, come here and you will find something to satisfy your appetite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=140

Cassandra our server seemed to have 3 tables and it took 25minutes to get my first drink. When patiently asking what was taking so long I was told the bar was backed up which 2 minutes later I had my drink.. I can understand if the bar was backed up (which it didn't appear to be) but at least have common courtesy to communicate with your table the reason why it's taking so long.  I ordered a burger which came with a flatbread bun that specifically asked not to get. The burger was over cooked.  The manager came by to ask how everything was and I honestly told him that I wasn't happy. He had a condescending attitude on trying to make things right...

Pineapple chicken. Coconut lime Chicken. Cauliflower steak (which I would never order cauliflower ever) was just incredible. And They actually sold out on that dish. Nice.  The service is always great. Our server even gave us an entire loaf of their bread when we asked for some to take home.  Who does that ?!?  What a pleasant surprise.  For desert I like cheesecake but actually love their tiramisu cake (not cheesecake). Top 5 best desserts EVER.  The chicken pot pie and shepherds pie are excellent. Garlic noodles with shrimp, Jamaican blacken shrimp. All good. I would never have thought of trying these dishes and we did. Wow. Very happy we did.

Dung N.,"San Diego, CA",2113,1694,7192,4.0,8/11/2015,"This place used to be extremely popular and they don't take reservations, so there would always be a long wait to get seated. Now, the wait isn't so bad (5-15 minutes)- maybe because they opened up a second location in Seaport Village? My favorite items to get are the luau salad and orange chicken. The salad has grilled chicken breasts layered with mixed greens, mango, and crispy wontons tossed in their vinaigrette. This salad is light and refreshing! They use chicken breast in the orange chicken entree too, so the pieces are big. Even though it's the Americanized version, it's still really good and not so greasy. The portions here are huge, so sharing is encouraged.  Of course you can't leave without having dessert. Their cheesecakes are awesome! We sat in the patio the last time I came here, but I was burning since it was so hot and there was no shade....I had the red velvet cheesecake and since I was celebrating my birthday, they sang for me! The dessert plate was decorated and the piece they gave me was gigantic. The layers of red velvet were moist and still as good as I remember.... I'm not sure if they give you bigger slices for your birthday or not, but it was twice as big as my friend's new york cheesecake.

It was my mistake that I had ordered the wrong cheesecake because the signs in the front had confused me on which was which. She gave me some good attitude even after apologizing that it was my mistake. I understand what it's like to work long hours with rude people but I was nice and at least deserved to be treated nicely back. I felt like it was a huge inconvenience for them to switch out the cheesecake. She didn't even say anything after I had said sorry again after they had done so.      All over this is a great restaurant and they have several locations in San Diego and have a great staff everywhere I have been (besides this one experience) but I thank the bartender and whoever created the cheesecakes because you are a god lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=160
Trisha A.,"San Diego, CA",1,25,2,2.0,11/5/2016,"I went here around 7 pm with a couple friends on Wednesday night. They said it was a 20 minute wait which was pretty accurate. We were seated outside which wasn't bad. We were given menus so we decided what we wanted. It took about 10 minutes for a server to come around and ask what drinks we wanted. I ordered a Sangria and my friend ordered a mango daiquiri. She didn't even try to card us.... isn't that illegal? I just passed her my ID anyways but she didn't even card my friend. Anyways, we also told her our food orders right then and there. I ordered a lunch size Caesar salad with chicken.  She brought us the waters quickly but it took around 45 minutes for another server to bring out the alcoholic drinks. I know it was busy but I was expecting the drinks would come out way before they actually did. When I finally got my sangria, it tasted like Kool aid. The food came 5-10 minutes later. Everyone at my table wasn't going to eat until everyone got their food. My simple salad came a few minutes after everyone else got their food (they all got hot plates).  We finished our food and our server didn't even come by til about 10 minutes after we finished. She collected our plates and one of my friends ordered a slice of cheesecake. Surprisingly the cheesecake came within 5 minutes. We each had a bite or 2 of the cheesecake and we were done. Then it took her about 15 minutes to ask how we wanted to split the check. Then 10 minutes later she finally came around with the checks. It took her another 10 minutes to process the checks, which is understandable because we were all doing separate.

Our server was great, but she hardly had time to serve us and would leave before we finished asking questions or placing orders. We ordered our drinks first, but it took a long time to get lemon for the ice tea. I had a Mohito, and the mint was hardly crushed. They literally just stuck 4 leaves in there.  I had the Chicken da Vinci. I've never had the Madeira sauce before. It was sweeter than I expected it to be and thicker but good. As usual, there's plenty of it and I took half of it home. My date ordered the chicken marsala. She had the opposite reaction than I did. She felt like it was thinner than it should've been and not tangy enough.  We ordered the tower cake to go. I'll have to let you know another time how good it was. The atmosphere is loud because of the high ceilings, but mood lighting makes you feel like you can have a private conversation.   All in all, we decided that if we came back it would be for lunch. The outside patio looks inviting, but it was too chilly tonight. The total bill for two meals, a Mohito, and ice tea, and one slice of tower cake, was $60.70 plus tip. We both have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow, unless the teenager gets to it first. EDIT:  OMG!!! The cake is to die for!!!!! Chocolate lovers dream!!!  If I could add 1/2 a star for it I would.  To the manager who commented, the only thing I could have asked you to fix would have been the Mohito.

Once we were seated, and had ordered there was another 45+ minute wait to get our food. To top that off, while we were waiting for our order the table next to us, who were seated after we had placed our order, received their food before our table did, long before. Ours took so long that a manager came by and apologized for the delay, which was nice. But the final slap in the face was when we finally got our food, it was incorrect. I do not mean cooked to the wrong temperature. The asparagus that was supposed to accompany my steak and potatoes was just not given to me. We were in San Diego for vacation and had to leave or we would be late for our after dinner plans so i spoke with a manager about the situation.

I just ordered an appetizer of loaded baked potato tots which I get all the time. Those were very good as always. My dad, however, got chicken Parmesan pizza style. He expected a pizza with chicken parm on it, with pasta. But, it turned out to be all chicken, pounded into a circular shape, with a lot of cheese and then noodles on top. Very interesting concept, but also misdescribed entirely on the menu. It was okay, not great. Our server TJ was very good and attentive, and when he asked my dad what he thought of the chicken parm dish, my dad was honest with him and said he did not enjoy it because it was not what he expected. TJ took it off our bill immediately without us even asking.

I was literally the first person to walk into the restaurant, right at 11 when it opened. We had a party of 5. I asked the hostess for a table, and she said, ""We just have to wait for the servers to come out."" Perfectly fine with me; we stood and waited. Not even two minutes later, some white guy barges past us with his guest, walks up to the counter, and the workers begin to grab menus. I glanced at the hostess to see if she might say, ""These ladies were here first,"" or something of the sort, but she said nothing. What a deflating feeling.  I didn't appreciate the second class treatment I experienced. When we later spoke to the manager, he had many excuses.

Amanda W.,"San Diego, CA",1,20,3,4.0,10/1/2017,"Food is pretty tasty, just a bit pricey. Only complaint was our Buffalo Wing appetizer came out cold even though we ordered them fried hard so they'd be crispy. Not sure why since they came out pretty quickly after we ordered. Shared the ribeye steak & the mashed potatoes were awesome. Added a side of mac-n-cheese which was okay. Too much mozzarella with their propitiatory cheese sauce. Best thing about our meal was the service we received. They sat us quickly & moved us easily to the outside after we saw that looked like a better option to enjoy our meal on a Friday night. Megan F. Was our waitress & she is a very sweet, attentive southern gal. She kept our waters filled, bread loaded, & condemns on point (blue cheese dressing is amazing by the way). Morgan took over while Megan went on a quick break & didn't miss a beat. What a great pair. Sure we'll be back, most likely for the great lunch deals. Like to try the brunch.

Me and a friend went in for some grub and were seated immediately...which was nice. Then no one checked on us for a good 10 minutes. A server finally walked over and introduced herself, we placed our drink orders and she repeated it back to me incorrectly 3 times. Headed down the wrong path already. It probably took a good 15 minutes for the drinks to show up. My friend's martini was made wrong. I had a mojito, it was mediocre at best. Then no server again. We're starving at this point, she finally passed by and asks if we need a few more minutes...I thought to myself, yea if you give us any more time we'd probably pass out. We place our food order, friend gets the fried mac and cheese, I order the chicken scampi. Then another server come up and introduces herself as the replacement as our original server went home. I will include a picture of my dish. It was the most bland, under salted, diluted dish I've ever tasted. I asked the service very politely if I could get a side of Alfredo sauce, and to my disappointment, that was completely watered down...it looked like some milk in a bowl and tasted as such. In the photo you can clearly see how the sauce doesn't even coat the pasta, it was dry, chicken was pale as a ghost...looks as if they boiled it or something. Overall huge disappointment. Server showed absolutly no concern for whether or not we liked our food. I took two bites from my dish, and the server asked if I wanted a box dryly, I refused and she brought us the check. Nothing else was said. I don't think I'll ever return or recommend anyone to this location.

Food to make you salivate, outstanding waitstaff, and a menu the size of a Charles Dickens novel.  If I were to write a review, I would start with the negative connotations to get them out of the way. First of all, the wait. OPT! Always! Never come at peak times. The wait will drive you nuts. This place is always crowded for a reason. The food. Now, I couldn't begin to tell you what to order....I like pretty much everything on the menu, other than salad. I ain't eating grass for nobody. I will tell you the wife's favorite dish: the Miso Salmon. This dish is awesome. She always gives me a bite and I love it but I've never ordered it for myself even though I say I will everytime.  Now, for the cheesecake. I love cheesecake. I love all the variations of cheesecake they offer but with some of the recipes, it ceases to be cheesecake if it has too many ingredients.  I love cheesecake plain and simple and I don't mind a variety like the one I tried today: The Salted Caramel. Delicious! Graham cracker crust, caramel, cheesecake.....Honey hush! This was awesome. That's about it. What can I tell you that you don't already know. If you've never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, I'm sure you'll find something you like. If you have, you've nothing else to try except a different variation of cheesecake.

I guess it's good if you are a family and just need those big establishments like Cheesecake, Buca De Beppo, Applebees etc.  I did however enjoy my miso glazed slamon, it was pretty decent...but I was also coming out from a work out so I was just hungry. I think cheesecake can be good, if they had good customer service. For a big establishment I don't think that's the least of their concern. Anyhoo, our server was horrible, she was non existent most of the time and after 30 minutes of waiting for our bill we were talking about how we should have gone somewhere else... What a waste of her time and our time.  To all the haters- this is an opinion. If I have a bad experience here don't hate because the servers here didn't do their jobs.

How do I figure out the best way to relate my experiences at The Cheesecake Factory to Yelp? like this... Eating at Cheesecake Factory is like having a one night stand with someone you come to regret the next day.  Like awkward one night stands, TCF always feels so good during the heat of the moment. Most of the entrees are so drool-worthy and delectable. There is nothing more satisfying than eating a delicious meal and ending the adventure with one of those signature cheesecake slices.  But unfortunately, you also come to regret eating at Cheesecake Factory every time because you feel like shit afterwards. Most of their entrees and desserts are high in calories, carbs and fat  ( I am talking to you Chicken Alfredo pasta!!!). Every time I eat here, I regret it because I feel like I am shortening my lifespan by 15 hours.  That being said, I can't resist the temptations of The Cheesecake Factory like I can't resist regrettable one night stands with women.

When we tried to cancel it our waitress rudely didn't want to go out of her way to cancel it so we had to wait another 20 minutes for it to arrive. We just wanted to get out of the restaurant as fast as we could since our experience was horrible and not worth the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=240
Israel H.,"Chula Vista, CA",167,27,6,2.0,5/20/2016,Let me start off by saying that I love the food here. The waiter we received was pretty friendly. However this particular visit wasn't one I was too fond of. I received a hair on my buffalo blast and wasn't too pumped about it. Upon showing my server he kinda just gasped about it and took that individual piece to the back. Wasn't too thrilled about eating the rest of them and how there was no offer to give me a new plate.

Kathy T.,"San Diego, CA",420,348,2384,3.0,7/13/2015,"UPDATE: 7/17/15 - I received a letter in the mail from ""Ashley"", and a gift card, which gave me a gift certificate for LESS THAN the amount I paid on my 7/8 visit. Plus, this manager took almost 10 days to address my issue by sending the gift card. Pro Tip: Dine in ONLY. Don't get food to-go (except cheesecake). Original Review: I hope the GM sees (and cares enough about his store) to read through this downgraded review. I don't know what was wrong with the Cheesecake Factory on the evening of 7/8/15, but the kitchen cook & to-go people were waaaaay off point. I thought previous curbside-take-out problems were a thing of the past. I was mistaken. FYI, we learned there's a new GM, Rod. When I was last here 23 days ago, the GM was Gil, who is probably somewhere where he's appreciated. 23 days later..... What I ate: Turkey sandwich on French bread. It's my go-to sandwich and I sometimes get a craving for it. Not after tonight.  When ordering on the phone: I ordered my usual ""turkey sandwich"". What I got was a to-go take-out tray filled with green lettuce (no tomatoes, onions, or anything remotely related to salad accompaniments) -see picture of my 'side salad' .  It really wasn't even a salad. It was dry, plain greens, with the dressing on the side. Putting the salad dressing on the side was the only thing they did right. So, I get A HALF OF A TURKEY SANDWICH, which was practically tucked underneath the salad.  I really can't understand why they get this sandwich so wrong so many times. It's easy!  My sandwich was haphazardly made & shoved into a container full of plain, green lettuce. (See CORRECT sandwich from last review.) The girl who took my order over the phone said the sandwich comes with a side salad & soup. I chose wild mushroom soup, which is a fancy name for yucky (in this case). How do I delicately say my soup looked like someone had had the runs in a cup and put a lid on it. I guess if the shoe fits..... I'm serious.  Don't get the mushroom soup!  It was completely liquid, there was not 1 mushroom in it. Weird. So gross. (See picture of ""wild mushroom soup"".) I bet they throw a lot of this soup away when closing time comes. I tried calling the store manager last night, but was sent on a wild goose chase twice and never talked to a manager. So I hope he sees this and fixes the hot mess he has going on in curbside/kitchen/cook organization. It ran so smoothly a couple months ago. Please be organized!  I just spoke with ""Ashley"", store manager. She seemed to be a very young manager. I told her how horrible the food, the kitchen and take out staff were last night. Her excuse: She told me they got a lot of traffic from Comi-Con that night. The result of me trying to iron it out? Ashley said wild mushroom soup usually has a few pieces of mushroom but is generally pulverized. Yes, it was pulverized.....completely!  Don't ever order ""wild mushroom soup"" and maybe they will take this monstrosity off the menu.  Ashley said they would mail me a $10 gift card, BUT not for the total amount of what I paid ($35.13). That's such an insult. And after giving a 25% tip (FOR TAKEOUT!)!!! That's funny! I understand that sometimes crap happens, but ALL THE TIME??? Cheesecake Factory, this bad service is getting to be a habit. Ashley's tone to me: ASHLEY WAS UNPROFESSIONAL, CONDESCENDING, & COULDN'T CARE LESS!  Guest satisfaction leaves little to be desired.  I hope somebody smacks me upside the head next time I mention going to Cheesecake Factory. Cheesecake only ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=240

Dennis P.,"Escondido, CA",707,125,579,4.0,9/22/2015,"Quick Tip: Kobe Burger is a must try. Get it medium rare. You're welcome ;) I'm going to show some love to their burger for this review. I'm sure you're asking yourself ""why did this guy order a burger at The Cheesecake Factory and why am I reading this review?"" Well, thank you for reading and yes, I ask myself the same question ""why a burger at The Cheesecake Factory?"" I'm so glad I got it. The only reason I got it was because my good friend, Brendon, who is also a burger connoisseur, recommended the Kobe Burger. If another fellow burger connoisseur says the burger is good, then it must be good! I had the The Classic Burger with Kobe beef and their brioche bun, medium rare. If you don't get your steaks or burgers medium rare...there is something wrong with you, or something wrong with me, but really medium rare was juicy, but not to the point where the burger juices are running down your hand. I can't stand a dry patty or a sloppy patty. This patty was cooked perfectly. The flavor and the texture of the patty was on point. The ratio to bun to meat was right on. The bun molded to the burger, making it so easy to pick up and put down. It puts a smile to my face when the bun can mold to the patty and become one entity, to join forces and enter the mouth of a hungry burger connoisseur.  The Classic Burger was hefty and I couldn't even finish it! I didn't want to disrespect the burger and it's ancestors, so I kept taking bites even though I was beyond full. Then I gave up because I forgot that I was at TCF! When at The Cheesecake Factory, eat like a Cheesecake Factory! wait, whaaaa? I got my burger with their house fries instead of the sweet potato fries.  I hope this review has opened your mind to the burgers at TCF. I've never had bad experiences at The Cheesecake Factory and I've been to over 5 different locations multiple times. So I'm glad to say that their servers are well trained, educated on their menu, and polite.

Hungry M.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,1,1.0,10/23/2016,"This is my first time writing a bad review. I normally don't like to give bad reviews because I understand that sometimes people had off days but my whole experience at this establishment was horrible. I have dined here many times over the years and I will not be coming back after this visit.  We were seated an hour and a half before our movie was started. I was two other people and only two of us were going to eat because the third person wasn't hungry. Our order was a pasta dish and ""The Factory Burger."" Nothing complicated right? Shouldn't take close to 40 mins to cook right? Wrong. We waiting for about 40 mins to get our food. The couple next to us were seated about 10 mins after we were and got their complete meal before we did. They had an appetizer and guess what else they ordered??? Two burgers. I had to ask the waiters twice about our food. This alone was not enough to make the dining experience unpleasant. I understand that sometimes things happen. What made me angry enough to write a negative review was the fact that my ""Factory Burger"" was nothing but bread, a slice of tomato, a slice of cheese, and a few pieces of grilled onions. The bread they used were the stale sourdough they typically serve you before you get your meal. It wasn't warm or crispy. It was stale and chewy like a rubber shoe. If you are going to charge people close to $13 for a burger at least toast the bread. That was the most pathetic ""burger"" I have ever had. I couldn't even finish it. Fed it to the dog when I got home. Jack-in-the-Box serve better burgers. Also, the pasta dish we got was bland and extremely heavy on the cream.  The waiters walked past our table several times. I placed my empty cup near the edge of the table so they would notice that I needed a refill. Nope. Not a single person noticed. I had plenty of staff members walk by our table and look directly at our table. I had to call them over for a refill. Come on now. If you are a waiter and you ""check"" on your customer's table you should have the common sense to look at people's drinks to see if they need refills.

The bar staff was amazing that night, compliments to you for keeping sane despite how busy it was.  We started with the egg roll sampler, four different kind. It was an awesome way to try the different appetizer egg rolls on the menu. I have always loved their version and BJ's version of the avocado egg roll. The firecracker salmon egg roll was also excellent, will definitely re-order these. The other two egg rolls were good, but didn't stand out like the previous two that I mentioned.  We also decided to split a salad for an entree and my friend has been craving buffalo chicken strips. The fresh vegetable salad is out of this world good, loved all the components in it, the perfect mix of veggies. I placed portions on my plate the way it was plated and ate across, slowly eating each element and not just tossing it all together, sooooo good. The buffalo chicken strips stayed nice and crunchy, even with the buffalo coating.  Of course my friend ordered dessert, she always needs that touch of sweet at the end. I rarely order dessert here because it's super decadent and I'm usually way too full because of the portion sizes, but then she started talking about a mango cheesecake and I was in to try it.

I'm asking for a recommendation, not for a personal preference. Another note is how incredibly dense their menu is - so unnecessary. Cut it down, there's no reason to have a 12 page 100 item count menu. Will not revisit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=220

Like there are probably a ton of shittier food options you could pick but you're bound to find something you like here since they've got a ton of stuff to choose from on their menu.  Your meal starts off with complimentary french loaves and this sweet brown oat bread and packets of butter while you wait for your food. French bread is great and all but its all about that BROWN OAT BREAD MAN. I could eat that all day.   For appetizers I recommend Avocado egg rolls, buffalo chicken bombs, SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES, or the corn fritters.  For entree I recommend the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Comes with sweet chipotle pasta sauce, tortilla chips for that perfect crunch, and penne pasta cooked nice and aldente. And its like a crazy amt of food. TBH by the end of the night, I kind of feel like im going to die because of all the carbs, but its a great choice when you are looking to binge once in awhile.  Only thing is that they don't take reservations, whyyyyyyyyy u do thissssss. And none of their cheesecakes are made in house btw. They're all shipped frozen from coorporate. If you still miraculously have room in your stomach for dessert, feel free to indulge in a slice but be aware that they are really heavy.

Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,826,4.0,6/2/2013,"I try to make it a point that whenever I review a chain restaurant, I only write the negative reviews; because, seriously, why would I bother saying, 'the Sausage Biscuit at Burger King is to die for!  Four stars, King!' It is, by the way.  That place is a complete shit hole where good taste goes to die in a festering cesspool of its own waste while baking under a constant and sweltering noon day sun.  But the sausage biscuit ain't bad... DON'T JUDGE ME! But, I digress.  Cheesecake Factory, I come here every once in a while, invariably with extended family for either a loving get-together or to cushion a sudden shock, and every time I'm always satisfied and impressed by whatever we get. Sure, the wait times can be insane, we got there at 6:00 on a Friday night and weren't seated until after 7:00, but it's kinda worth it.  This last time around, my girlfriend and I split a Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and the Chicken Madeira. The salad was extremely fresh with a great and flavorful salsa garnish.  Despite the moisture of all the ingredients, the tostada shell below stayed crisp and deliciously salty.  And the chicken was well grilled, cooked to order, despite a crappy salad like you would get over at P.F. Changs. With the Chicken Madeira, the chicken itself was fairly breaded and moist, but it's the mushroom sauce that graces the top of it that really makes the dish.  Paired with Chessecake Factory's mashed red potatoes and grilled asparagus, and both of us were happily fed. Around the table was an Herb Crusted Salmon, simple but tasty.  Cashew Chicken, the only disappointment (a very mild one, at that) in my opinion.  FIsh and Chips, a staple of most restaurants that this one does a good interpetation of.  And Chicken Di Pana, that had a butter sauce that was surprisingly delicious. And then there's their namesake, the Chesecake.  Even the worst of cheesecake is pretty damn good; and the cheesecake here rests comfortably on the opposite side of that spectrum.  About the only complaint about the desserts, is that there aren't any that strain the realm of originality.  No chances are taken, about the biggest stray from the comfort of the tamest of palettes would be a salted caramel cheesecake (yes, Virginia, salt and sugar do go well together)... So, c'mon, don't hate too much on this franchise food stop in any upscale mall.  If anything, grab yourself a slice of Oreo Cheesecake for the car ride home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=340

She had the manager come bring it to us and he spoke so softly neither of us could hear anything he was saying, he seemed extremely timid and not really the composer of a manager which could be the underlying issue.

Theresa N.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,2,3.0,10/29/2016,"If you go any time around lunch or dinner during the weekend, there will pretty much definitely be at least a 20 minute wait for a table. Last time I tried, they don't do reservations more than an hour in advance, so keep that in mind if you're hungry. I tried getting around this by ordering curbside pickup, but even that was a long wait since the staff is so busy that time of day- I was on hold for 10 minutes to place the order and half an hour when I came to pick it up before I ended up just going in to bug them for my order. If you can get past the wait time though, once you get seated the waiters and servers are very welcoming and will go out of their way to get you what you need, despite how busy they are. Super friendly and accommodating staff! The pumpernickel (brown) bread is super addictive, so save room for your entree. My go-to is the angel hair spaghetti with shrimp; not too heavy but very filling. All of their cheesecakes are delicious but I can usually only get a few bites in and take the rest to go since they are so rich. My favorite is the vanilla bean with a side of caramel sauce.

Carlos V.,"San Diego, CA",118,62,39,4.0,7/2/2016,My girlfriend brought me here for a pre bday celebration. This place gets really crowded and there seems to always be a line. We waited about 10 minutes before we got seated so it wasnt bad. I was in the army and all you do is wait everywhere you go. So i dont mind waiting. We ordered calamari for the appetizer and two plates of the shrimp angelhair. I normally go to Italian spots for my calamari but decided to try it out since it was on the menu. I wasnt thrilled with the tartar  and shrimp cocktail sauce for dipping. The shrimp angelhair had more tomatoes  than anything else. But they do have some great cheesecake. Great mix to choose from. I had the raspberry truffle cheesecake and it was the best i have had lately.  This place is nice to take the family and friends. Good vibe and clean. Next time ill try something different when im in tbe area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=300
Amber G.,"Katy, TX",68,8,3,1.0,3/18/2017,"Food and the cheesecake was good as always. The 1 star was for the service. This was the first time my husband and I were able to get out together since having our second baby. It took a lot of coordination and prep to get away for a day date and it was ruined by our dining experience today. First of all we were sat really quickly which was great considering there was a lot of people waiting. We walked in on a Saturday at 2:15. Given 10-15 min and waited only 5. Great! Oh and side bar- it took forever to find a parking spot! But I know that is not CF's fault. Anyway we ordered two appetizers, I ordered a lunch size cup of soup and salad and husband ordered a pizza and a margarita. 20 minutes passed and I had to inquire about his margarita. Then about 10 min later one app came out then about 7 min later the second. Then we waited 30 more minutes for our meal. We were stressed because we were out against the clock with a baby left with only so much breastmilk to get through our date. An hour wait for a pizza, soup and salad! Then my salad was the wrong one! The waitress was nice and said the kitchen was backed up which I understand but it sucked. We ordered our cheesecake to go the moment our food came out which was brought to us right away. We won't be back, at least to this location. This restaurant is never not busy so the kitchen should be on it!

Our waiter was Joe.  He was very knowledgeable of the menu.  One of my friends asked what he preferred and why.  He not only told us what he liked, but why and how the food was prepared.  It was obvious to me that he really enjoyed his job and did his homework.  I have not seen that before, ever.  He was personable and friendly. My Turkey & Avocado Sandwich was very tasty, the bun was fresh, they did not skimp on the ingredients. I'd order it again. For dessert I had the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.  Very good, but I really did not taste the Reese's.   My friend ordered the Key Lime Cheesecake.  Now that was delicious.  Three of us ordered the cheesecake desserts and shared.  That is the way to do it.

Karen N.,"San Diego, CA",1,10,,1.0,8/14/2017,"If I leave a restaurant frustrated for any reason, it calls for a less than stellar Yelp review. My experience today at the cheesecake factory in Fashion Valley deserves that rating many times over due to the server(Patrick).  I came here for lunch after 1:00 when it was relatively quiet. It took a long time for my server to come to the table and the rest of the time I practically had to beg for any service, including having my ice tea refilled 2-3 times. When I ordered my sandwich with sourdough bread. he had a ""can't do attitude"" but then told me I could have it on a sourdough baguette. He then went to another table after taking my order and chatted them up for at least five minutes before putting my order in. I know because I watched him. When he came by I asked him if he had put my order in before talking at length with the other table. Defensively, he said that he knew his job and acted very cavalier.  He did this over and over, keeping his tables waiting much longer than expected. I don't mind a server talking to his customers, but not at length or at the expense of the other people waiting for reasonable service. He just seemed unable or inexperienced in how to manage his time well. That's one thing but then to act as though he was in the right was very offensive. When my sandwich finally arrived it was not on the sourdough baguette. I was not going to risk another unpleasant interchange with him or wait any longer to have the order corrected. I left a more than reasonable tip in spite of his poor service, but I won't be back to this restaurant nor recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=300

We arrived somewhere between lunch and dinner so there was no wait. The parking was still a little bit challenging since it was right next to the mall but eventually I found a spot right upfront.  The place smells like amazing garlicky food and made my mouth water. We got a little table in the corner and decided to get smoothies and tropical flavored iced tea to drink. The menu is really extensive so it takes a while to read through. So many amazing options, but finally settled on a pear Gorgonzola salad along with the lemon garlic shrimp with angel hair pasta.

Even tried to expedite the wait by talking with the manger, nothing came of it other than it will be another 5 mins. Oh oh oh oh okay.... Too long Of a wait for a large party. So large parties, I wouldn't recommend.  The waiter, Franklin, was great and attentive and to add handsome! Lol  I ordered, my all time favorite, Louisiana Chicken Pasta and a passion fruit mojito. I mean, I haven't had this dish in forever and I was wanting it at this point! I was hungry and ready to chow down! The food took a while for it to come out but with 16 ppl, that's understandable!  However, my plate was hot and my food was luke warm and even had some chicken that was a bit cooler than room temp! Ugh but the hell with it I was hungry!!!  The taste of the food was like I imagined! Just cooler! Lol good thing I like cold food!  Will I be going back? Probably not with a larger party! There are other restaurants in the area I still need to try! Well that's until I get that craving for some LCP!! Coming from working in the industry, I would say overall, the wait was horribly long!

Elaine M.,"San Diego, CA",178,5,2,4.0,5/26/2016,"This is one of our favorite restaurants to indulge in sit down food with somewhat of a nice ambience.  We have tried A LOT of the menu items. My favs are... As opposed to spending twice as much on steak at Ruth Chris, I can enjoy a well cooked, flavorful steak here: 1) Rib Eye Steak 2) Filet Mignon (Medium well, butterfly cut) For when my palate craves pungent garlic.  3) Pasta Carbonara 4) Garlic Noodles Of the chicken options, I'd go with the crispy texture of the: 5) Chicken Piccata I favor the white sauces over the red (sometimes tastes too bland for my taste, almost like store bought canned red sauce with bits of meat.) The alfredo is creamy and buttery, but if you wanted to pick a red sauce, go with the: -Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic My favorite dessert picks would be: 1) Linda's Fudge Chocolate Cake 2) Dulce de Leche 3) Macadamia cheesecake Each cake is so decadent and rich, I could only eat 1/3 each sitting. I usually take the rest to go to either share or eat for dessert again the next day. Not a fan of their new anniversary cheesecake though because I personally think there were too many flavor combinations that didn't compliment well with another.  Also not a fan of their customer service, which was why I deducted a star. Almost 90% of the time that we dined there, the waiter/waitress seemed to be overly rushed, distracted (like chickens with their heads chopped off) and in 1 instance a newbie didn't know how to process my gift card and didn't bother to ask how to fix the problem or ask the mgmt for help. We aren't high maintenance picky eaters. I wasn't demanding that they baby sat us.

Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,4.0,12/23/2014,"This past year, The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) celebrated ""National Cheesecake Day"" on two days (July 30-31) instead of just on the last day of July. When I was in Hawaii, I always had wanted to go to the one Cheesecake Factory on the island for this celebration--in which you get 50% off a cheesecake for dine-in only--but I knew the Waikiki location would be absolutely chaotic (more chaotic than it actually is). But, I figured it was worth a shot going to the Fashion Valley Cheesecake Factory in San Diego to experience my first ""National Cheesecake Day"" ... and I just had my fingers crossed that it would not be too frenzied.   Much to my surprise, my dining experience at this Cheesecake Factory was better than I thought it would be. I met a friend around 7 p.m. for dinner; I came a little early to put our name in, and I was actually seated within 10 minutes. There were larger parties waiting to be seated, but the crowds were not as large (or crazy) as I imagined they would be.   I perused the menu while I waited for my friend, but I already have a few tried-and-true Cheesecake Factory favorites (including cheesecakes). Our server was attentive and friendly, and she brought us everything we needed without us really asking (extra water, napkins, etc.). I had a great first-time visit to this location and would definitely come here again. And, my friend and I were both happy to experience our first-ever ""National Cheesecake Day"" celebration with our discounted cheesecakes. Here's what I would recommend if you're dining here: ""Macaroni and Cheese Burger"": This burger definitely falls under the ""gourmet"" category. It's unique because it includes a slightly flattened deep-fried mac and cheese ball (like the ones featured in the appetizer mentioned above) atop a charbroiled patty, Cheddar cheese sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickles, an onion and mayo. I would recommend only eating half of this savory burger if you plan to save room for dessert. ""Chicken Madeira"": This chicken dish is famous as the eatery's ""most popular chicken dish."" Flavorful and savory, this one is definitely a winner. The dish contains a couple pieces of tender, sautéed chicken breast topped generously with melted Mozzarella cheese and pieces of asparagus. It's also covered with flavorful mushroom Madeira sauce and is served with fluffy mashed potatoes. Again, if you're a cheese lover, you'll want to indulge in this savory dish. ""Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple"": Be forewarned -- this is probably one of the sweetest cheesecakes on the menu, but it's definitely one of my favorites. This decadent dessert features the original cheesecake in an Oreo Cookie crust and includes caramel, chunks of Butterfingers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and peanut butter throughout. Peanut butter lovers will especially appreciate the fresh dollop of peanut butter mousse that comes atop the cheesecake.  ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"": Even though this sounds overwhelmingly sweet, ironically, this cheesecake isn't as sweet as its close cousin, the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, because it contains layers of moist chocolate fudge cake in between the layers of cheesecake (versus layers of pure cheesecake). The layers of moist chocolate cake offset and complement the layers of cheesecake in a nice way, and peanut butter lovers will rejoice upon eating the dollop of peanut butter mousse atop the dessert. There are generous chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (my favorite candy) loaded in the cheesecake layers, and there are also thin layers of caramel. Finally, the crust is an absolute wonder, as it's covered with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups as well.  ""Loaded Baked Potato Tots"": I think this is one of the newer additions to TCF's menu--I have never noticed tots on the menu before--but it sounds like a yummy shareable app. It features crispy potato tots filled with cheese, bacon and green onions, and it comes served with sour cream. Think of your traditional loaded baked potato skins ... but in tots form! I love tater tots more than fries, so I definitely want to try this snack-like dish one day. ""Bruleed French Toast"": I think this is what I ordered for breakfast on the first and only time I went to TCF for brunch on a Sunday. I did really enjoy my meal because I love thick-sliced pieces of toast -- alone, on a sandwich, anything. This entrée features thick slices of rustic French bread that's baked and grilled to a golden brown and topped with powdered sugar. Yum! I remember savoring each bite of toast, which sported a soft, chewy interior and had that crunchy exterior that tasted even better with the added sweetness from the powdered sugar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=320

The food we did get was ok, but even for takeout the boxes and presentation was sloppy. I've used this before at other Cheesecake Factory locations and the service was great. I would not recommend using the curbside service at all at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=320

Marshall M.,"Goose Creek, SC",24,7,,4.0,2/9/2017,"Obviously, being a Cheesecake Factory, the aesthetics are going to be good. My waiter was good, the time it took to prepare my food was on par. The food itself needed something, I ordered the bacon-bacon burger with French fries. The burger was well... average, though it had this smaller disc of meat inside that I was not a particular fan of, the fries were again average. They did give me a basket of 2 pieces of bread and those were good, but not great. A good place to go if you are not a good snob or are just there for an occasion. Prices were as expected, slightly on the expensive side but not too bad. End result: B+",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=280

I almost felt like VIP because I greeted by the host and less than one minute, we were seated down with a waiter waiting to take our drink orders! Wait!! Do we look like celebrity look-a-likes?! Don't think so, but got outstanding service!! The hardest and most frustrating thing about Cheesecake is deciding on WHAT TO EAT! When you're starving, everything sounds delish, but I settled on the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta! I laughed when he brought the plate because it looked like one of those giant salad bowls filled with pasta galore!! The difficult part about the pasta was trying to not make yummie noises while eating it because it was delicious! It was something different, but amazing!  You would think that would be enough!! But we decided to save our leftovers for a midnight snack and get the Chocolate Brownie Sundae! We didn't order any alcoholic drinks, but we got chocolate wasted from this! I took a few bites and I was done, a bit too much for me! I would rather have something light and fluffy, not really dense considering I just gorged myself on carbs!

Cynthia R.,"Oceanside, CA",80,3,,1.0,2/20/2017,"I came to this location on Saturday 2/18/17 around 3:45pm. I went to the Women's restroom around 4:00pm and notices that the stall I was in was very very low on toilet paper. I let the girl waiting to take my stall out of courtesy in case she wanted to wait for a different stall. The bathroom itself looked dirty and the trash was overflowing. I let the hostess with long light brown hair know that the restroom was very low on toilet paper and continued to wait for my table. Around 4:40pm I heard 3 different women complain to one of the managers that the Women's bathroom was disgusting and had NO TOILET PAPER! These women were all very angry, one even complained that her son was literally on the toilet waiting  for someone to bring toilet paper for over 10 mins. This got me very irritated especially since I told the hostess at 4:00pm that the toilet paper was running low and now it was 40 mins later. The manager was apologetic and got people in there to clean up and restock but still this shouldn't happen ever especially considering the amount of employees working at the time. Makes you question how often they check on the restrooms. If I would have been that hostess, I would have gone in there myself and resupplied the toilet paper or alerted the manager right away to get someone to do it ASAP. This could have been avoided.  Our server Ellen was great so she would get a 5 stars from me. The restroom situation doesn't even deserve 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=280

My wife ordered the Mai tai and I got the Flying Gorilla. The Flying Gorilla is perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. It's a giant chocolate milkshake with alcohol which is perfect for me. We were very pleased with our drinks. My wife ordered the avocado egg rolls and I ordered the smokehouse BBQ burger. Both were very satisfying, perfectly cooked, good flavor. Drinks were a bit pricier than I was expecting, but they were pretty big so I guess I can't complain. $60 for 2 drinks, 1 entree, and 1 appetizer is a bit more than I wanted to spend on lunch but at least it was good.

They said they didn't have one so we sat and worked until my friend's laptop was dying and we were about to lose much of what we had been working on for an hour while we waited for our food.  So then we asked if they could take the laptop to wherever there was an outlet and plug it in for us.  They said ""we have no outlets available to you.""   I was in total disbelief.  Am I really expected to believe they have no outlets? Is that how much they value their customers?  We have been in there several times because we like to have working lunches but this waiter was so rude (he was very young) that we won't make their mistake again.

Their cheesecake is the best off course with all different flavors. Last time I ordered the MANGO KEY LIME CHEESECAKE and it was delicious.

Regardless of the +100000 calorie count, it's always pretty good comfort food. However, last night I had a really disappointing experience that has caused me to rethink going back to this location.  My mom and I ate dinner at around 7 pm and right when we sat down we ordered. My mom ordered the sliders and I ordered the garlic noodles. The food was taking a little while but I get it, Cheesecake Factory is always busy, so why not give them the benefit of the doubt? 25 minutes later the sliders arrive, but no garlic noodles. A waiter comes by and tells me the garlic noodles will be right out. 10 minutes pass and another waitress comes by and says the noodles will be right out. Finally our waiter comes out and tells me the kitchen made a mistake and the noodles were delivered to another table. Is that really the kitchen's mistake, or the server's? Hmmm... 10 MORE minutes go by and the manager comes over and apologizes for the delay. She tells me the noodles were delivered to another table and the patrons at that table ate the noodles. Fine, it happens. She asks me if I want a soup or salad; I decline. The noodles came out shortly after that and after waiting almost an hour for the noodles, my appetite wasn't what it was when I first walked in.  The check comes and the noodles were still on the check. Now perhaps I sound like a cheapskate, but one would think taking a $14 meal off of a check in order to provide good customer service shouldn't be an issue. How about offering a slice of cheesecake? Nothing. Just a few half-assed apologies and excuses and an hour of waiting for noodles. What a disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=280

I joke and like to give my server a hard time... most of the time in good fun... and he took it all in stride and played along!! FOR THE WIN!) Attentive and gave awesome suggestions, even exchanged my drink when it didn't come out tasty.... Tim had been wishing for avocado eggrolls and wouldn't shut up about them so we started with those... From there we decided to just do share plates for the rest of the food. Good choice! Lynn suggested the Pasta Carbonara and he could not have been more right! We also ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and The Everything Pizza. Everything was so delicious.  We got to sing some happy birthday to a table next to us and were encouraged to join in!!! My kind of place! While Tim stuck with his Jack and cokes I tried the pineapple Moscow Mule and let me tell you something... it has two of my favorite things... pineapple and Moscow Mule... and it was delicious!!!! My second drink I ordered a regular mule and it didn't come out too tasty so Lynn exchanged it for a vodka tonic for me no questions asked! (great service). Between the four of us our bill was a little under $100. We walked away fat and happy. It was great company and we didn't walk out of the until almost 1 am.

That's when I realized the only cool part was pretty much the illusion that was painted of this place being worth it, due to the higher priced dishes.  I guess all those youthful years of it being not so attainable to me made me raise my expectations about this place...then finally trying it out and found it was just mehhh.  It's OVERRATED!  I'll be honest, I loved their carbonara bow tie pasta dish until I realized it was nearly 2000 calories!  I'm not a super health fanatic, but gotdamn!  So I finally went back last week for a birthday dinner and saw that they now have a ""Skinnylicious Menu"".  Haha. I ordered their Seared Ahi Tuna Salad- fish was not fresh.  The only thing good about this salad was the dressing! I also tried their chicken and mushroom wraps.  Meh!  Even Pick Up Stix are better.

The highlight of the dinner was the fancier setting. For the price, there are other restaurants with savory food. We got two pasta plates, and a side of fried vegatables and portabello mushrooms.

I got there a little after the 35 minute mark and called like I was suppose to.... 20 minutes later the guy comes out with my food. I look through it and he forgot a pasta. I asked if he could please go get it and  he asked to look through the food and asked me if I know what it looked liked??? It looks like pasta. I ordered 3 pastas and there are 2 here so yeah I knew what it looked like.  I asked three times including on the phone for extra bread and he forgot to do that. He brought two loads of bread for 3 pasta dishes and a chicken dish. He finally comes back with the missing pasta and no apology at all. Great service there!!!

Mackenzie P.,"San Diego, CA",122,40,124,4.0,10/12/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is overpriced for what it is. They used to have giant slices of cheesecake for the same price they are now. I came here a few nights ago with some friends, and was disappointed by the size of my cheesecake. The Oreo cheesecake is always delicious, but could have used a little more for what I paid. (Almost $8 for one slice) As an appetizer before hand, a friend and I split the avocado egg rolls. 6 came on a plate so we each ate three which seemed like a perfect portion since we decided to skip a main course. The dipping sauce is good and the egg rolls were fresh and hot. Again, a little overpriced for how many came out of you have a larger group with you, but tasty none the less. We sat outside on a nicely furnished outdoor seating patio with really nice heating lamps by each table. The atmosphere of the whole outdoor area had an unusually upscale feel to it. Really enjoyable to hang out with friends and have a normal volume conversation.  The staff seemed very friendly and inviting.

David G.,"San Diego, CA",1400,1079,2135,4.0,3/19/2013,"It's serious business when $100 worth of Cheesecake Factory gift cards comes your way. Just think of all that cheesecake.  Endless fatty, chocolatey goodness, gradually hardening your arteries until you drop dead from acute myocardial infarction. Sounds lovely, huh? That's why, instead of ordering a mountain of cheesecake, I spent my $100 on two consecutive brunches filled with salad and white wine. Don't get me wrong -- salad at the Cheesecake Factory isn't ""healthy"" per se, but it's still better than the alternatives filling up their War & Peace-length menu. Over the course of two brunches, I pretty much ran the gamut of Cheesecake Factory's salad menu.  Here's the list of what I tried: ** Tuna tataki salad -- seared tuna, avocado, mixed greens, tomato ** Chicken tostada salad -- grilled chicken, tortillas, black beans, corn, onions, cilantro ** Carlton salad -- romaine lettuce, grilled chicken, feta, avocado, cranberries, pears, orange ** BBQ ranch chicken salad -- chicken, avocado, tomato, cucumber, onion strings It figures that the salad I liked the *least* (the tuna tataki -- fairly bland) is the healthiest.  In fact, that one is on Cheesecake Factory's ""SkinnyLicious"" menu, meaning it's under 500 calories, so you can enjoy it without guilt.  (Unfortunately, every time I see the word ""SkinnyLicious"" in print, I gag a little.)   Likewise, the best of these salads in the least healthy (the BBQ ranch chicken salad -- very flavorful and satisfying).  It just goes to show that trying to eat healthy at the Cheesecake Factory is a lost cause indeed.   You can't go wrong with the chicken tostada or Carlton salads, either. I also had a cup of hot chocolate for dessert.  It was delicious, but I nearly cried when I saw that it probably contained more calories than the rest of my meal put together. Other random notes: ** Cheesecake Factory is always mobbed.  Brunch, lunch, dinner -- it doesn't matter.  Avoid the crowds and sit at the bar, where there's never any wait at all. ** Speaking of the bar, their $8 Riesling is excellent. ** Also speaking of the bar, the bar staff are a lot friendlier and less rehearsed than the waitstaff.  Chatting with them is a good way to minimize the corporate feeling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=360

If you like spice, bold flavors, and different textures, this is the pasta dish for you! I get it every time because it's absolutely delicious. It's a hearty, generous portion of al dente penne pasta smothered in a spicy chipotle parmesan cream sauce. The spice in this dish is more flavorful than it is packed with heat, so spice lovers rejoice. It is topped off with a medley of peas, onions, red and yellow peppers, crisp asparagus, and juicy pieces of honey glazed chicken. The vegetables are a perfect blend of flavors that really enhance the dish. It's topped off with slivers of tortilla chips for added texture and perfected with plenty of Parmesan cheese.

This location is at Fashion Valley mall and the parking lot is ridiculously small but there is a small garage next to it too. I have been to some of their other locations including Irvine CA, Newport Beach CA, Glendale AZ, etc. They are always the same, amazing!  The food is always consistently good, very delicious. I like the chicken piccata, chicken marsala, Kobe burger, jambalaya, burrito,  and many other plates. The prices are a little high, but worth it, portions are usually generous, and the quality of the food is excellent. $7-9 for cheesecake and cake is expensive but it is great! They have 2 peanut butter chocolate versions too. They have a friendly staff, good service, and there is outdoor seating. If you just go in to get a slice of cheesecake to go, they don't have a good system or queue in my opinion. You have to wait to hear what slice they are calling out, they don't say your name, and anyone can just come up and walk away with your to go order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=360

I expected nothing but great service and food, but unfortunately it was totally the opposite. We had terrible service since we got there. Order drinks we got them an hour later. The food took even longer. My father in law ordered a medium rib eye steak that was 27 dollars!! But he got what looked like an 8oz well done steak that was cooked on a griddle instead of an actual grill!! Father in law has been a  professional chef for many years and knows his steaks so he decided to return it. Meanwhile everyone else tried to continue along with their meals. However, this simple act was an entire challenge all on its own as our server decided to disappear for the remainder of our stay. We NEVER got asked if we wanted a refill on ANY of our drinks. No soda, no water, no coffee, no beer. NOTHING!!! No one even came to ask us if we needed anything. We finished our diners and my father in law was still waiting for his steak. Another 20 minutes went by and the manager finally shows up to apologize but by this point everyone was done with the horrible service so we just asked her to give us the darn steak to go. When we finally got it we opened the box and found a larger piece of steak than the one they had initially brought out BUT it was cut STRAIT DOWN THE MIDDLE!!!! Totally unprofessional. This is by FAR the WORST dining experience we have EVER had!! EVER!!!  We can honestly say that we will never return to this location.

Didn't really get the indoor experience, since we ate outside (I guess the wait was a little shorter), but the inside looked really nice.  Parking can be a little difficult, but the parking garage is next door and just a walk away.  Service here was great, unfortunately I don't remember our servers name, but she was awesome.

Faye L.,"San Diego, CA",515,1213,8810,4.0,9/18/2012,"Enough reviews and pics have been posted on this. Here is what I order almost EVERY SINGLE TIME: Avocado Eggrolls:  Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce - *mind blowing*. Words cannot describe how awesome this dish is. Even if you hate avo, try this dish. It might just convert you. Their tamarind dipping sauce is stupid good Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Madeira : Our famous Shrimp Scampi sautéed with whole cloves of garlic, white wine, fresh basil and tomato AND Sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus & melted mozzarella cheese and fresh mushroom Madeira Sauce. - the sauces for BOTH these dishes make this *THE* best entree here. I crave this dish like no other.  So a few side notes: Ordered TO GO for first time few weeks ago... - person taking order was nice and efficient - there is supposed to be reserved designated spots for Cheesecake factory customers picking up food. ALL 3 spots were taken. I saw 1 spot being taken by lame loverbird teenage couple grabbing subway or something in the mall. The other 2 spots were taken by handicap drivers (I didn't know this but if you have a decal, you can park anywhere that says reserved?). - someone will come out to your car and give you receipt. You then give them your credit card, they go back inside to process, and then come out to get your signature and tip - the to go order of my combo scampi shrimp and chicken Madeira was really nicely done. It looked and tasted awesome. They also packaged extra sauce for me per my request - the bread that came w/ it was nice as well Here's my gripe: - ordered low carb cheesecake. Didn't want strawberries on it. They put strawberries on there but the girl that came out to take my credit card said they didn't charge me extra for berries. Came home and 1) cheesecake looked AWFUL + puny ; 2) the berries that came with it looked old and over riped and 3) they charged me for the berries I didn't want. The presentation was terrible.  If you've been to CF before, the cheesecake section is separate from kitchen. They usually bust out the dessert orders pretty fast. I put the blame on them, and them alone, for the cheesecake disaster.  I called the manager to voice my concern as we had driven 25 min one way to get our order. I just told him it was disappointing to get such a sad cheesecake b/c we've always been so happy w/ our food there. He was a bit defensive and asked 'did you eat the cheesecake, wasn't it ok'. And I said no, we haven't touched it, we're staring at it right now. He took the item off the bill (haven't confirmed yet) which we appreciated. I told him that we really loved what the kitchen produced but that he should tell the cheesecake prep girls to take more pride in what they put out. Anyhow, the low carb cheesecake tasted terrible. The crust is really gritty tasting. I'd rather run 20 miles and then treat myself to one of their full carb slices of cheesecakes next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=440

Our buffalo blasters appetizers were delicious.  We were done with them, and about 25 minutes later, my Jambalaya comes out solo... They said my husband's Shepherds Pie would be right out.  Manager stopped by to offer a soup or salad so that he could eat with me while he waited, but we just had a large app and he didn't want to spoil his appetite for his dinner entree. Another 15 minutes of eating my Jambalaya alone, still no Shepherds Pie.  A few minutes later, it finally comes.  It was OK to say the least, but by that time, we were so done waiting around, we had a couple bites and asked for the food Togo.  Server never came back around to ask how our food was and wasn't really apologetic for how long the food took.  Being in the industry, we were really nice and understanding to the fact that shit happens. Ordered some Cheesecake Togo and that took another 15 minutes... As servers ourselves... We were pretty shocked that the server/management didn't really took into account the all waiting time we were doing... A cheesecake comped would've been nice, but I guess that's not how The Factory's guest satisfaction policy rolls.

You also have to have extreme patience for waiting as they don't take reservations & there is enough waiting for about 5 people inside. NOTHING on the menu is low cal or low in fat. They itemize every menu item so even if it appears healthy, it's not, but when you go to the Cheescake Factory you have to be okay with that! One thing they do really well, portions. The portions are enough for 3-4 people, but are considered 1 serving - yeah for leftovers!  The salads are large, fresh and good. The free bread is always hot and soft - yum! I do like the pasta, but you cannot leave without trying cheesecake. To be honest, you should order it first so you aren't too full. I normally stick with plain or plain w/strawberries, but this last time I tried the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate and OH MY GOODNESS, I am getting it every time!

This one is usually busy due to the location it's in. I Ike this place because I have ordered many foods off their menu and nothing has made me feel like ""I knew I shoulda just stuck to what I always get"" lol. I've tried many of their appetizers, a couple of their entrees, their drinks, and of course their cheesecake. The food and service has always been good ever since my first visit. Even thought it's always busy, the service hasn't been too laggy where you gotta ask twice. If you're looking for good foods to try I recommend their calamari, avocado egg rolls, chicken bellagio, steak diane, or their grilled chicken avocado club.

Additionally, the staff member who wrote my birthday message in frosting had horrible penmanship.  I know it's frosting but dang!  I didn't even complain because I didn't want to spend another hour there.  I drove all the way to the North County location, calling on the way to order a plaque and telling them my message, walked in and paid ($3) and picked it up in about 4 minutes total.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=380
Tim S.,"Surprise, AZ",112,1124,1499,3.0,2/9/2013,"3.5 stars.  Solid! This is my wifes favorite place in the world.  We had a gift card and decided to come down here for lunch today.  This place is a giant cluster F.  We put our names in and had to wait for about 25 minutes to be seated.  We did get a booth in a section away from all the madness so that was cool.  This is what we ordered and how they stacked up. Appetizer-  Avocado egg rolls.  These things were great.  My wifes friend always gets them and until today, I had never had one.  They are egg roll wrappers stuffed with avocado and some other stuff.  They were pretty freaking tasty.  $9.99 tasty?  Eh... debatable.  Cuban Sandwich-  You cant find Cuban sandwiches at most places.  It sounded good so I thought I would give it a shot.  It turned out to be awesome!  The bread was good (not a traditional Cuban sandwich bread), the pork, ham, cheese and pickles melded together.  It was a really good sandwich.  It also comes with a little cup of fries.  They salt the hell out of them (thank goodness....I hate places that dont salt their fries) and they were really hot, crispy and tasty.  Some real good fries.  I would definitely get this sandwich and fries again. Pizza and Caesar salad lunch special-  My wife got this one.  It comes with a large sized salad and a personal/small pizza.  The pizza was just meh.  The crust was way way way way too thin and it was droopy and greasy.  The taste was alright but the crust was so badly messed up it took away from how good it usually is ...so says my wife. Dessert-  We went with the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  Holy mother of GOD!  This thing was possibly the best chocolate dessert I have ever encountered.  This thing was a massive slice!  Here is the description straight from their website    "" OREO® Cookies baked in our creamy Cheesecake with layers of fudge cake and OREO® Cookie mousse. Topped with a milk chocolate icing.""  This thing was so creamy and chocolatey and rich and decadent.  Chocolate fudge, cheesecake, Oreos, cake, whipped cream etc....it was flat out amazing.  I may have to come back very very soon just to grab a slice of this awesomeness.  Overall, the food was very good.  A few things keep it from being rated higher than it should IMO.  Its always way too busy and the wait is long.  Its expensive too.  Even with our $25.00 gift card, the total after tax and tip still came out to $37.00.  Basically a $62.00 lunch.  That did include the appetizer and dessert but that is still a little expensive for lunch.  At the end of the day, that Oreo cheesecake was worth the price of admission alone.  If you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate/Oreos, head on down immediately and grab yourself a slice of heaven!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=380
Samantha V.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,1,1.0,3/5/2017,"My first time going to the Cheesecake Factory was not a good experience! I needed to make reservations for a party of 12. So when I called to make a reservation they told me that they don't make reservations. So I decided on a Saturday night it might get busy so I showed up an hour early. It was around 5 I told them I had a party of 12 they said it would be an hour and a half wait. They told me it could have been faster if I made reservations which apparently they do only 1 hour before they open. So they need to clarify some information with their employees, I definitely did not want to sit around and wait that whole time. Also the place was so packed I could barley talk to the hosts who seemed way to busy to talk to me. They were ignoring me and more interested in socializing. I went in after an hour went by to check on how much longer It would be and she looked at me like I was asking her such a difficult question and with lots of attitude she said ""well you've only been waiting an hour, so"" the way she said it made it seem like an hour is not long time. Well it definitely it when you start getting hangry. I started noticing that people who were coming in after me were already leaving. 2 hours and waiting we finally get seated at 7. Then our waitress comes and let me tell you she was EVERYWHERE. I understand we were a big party but she was giving people the wrong drinks even drinks from different tables. The food took FOREVER to come out and when it finally did either it was food meant for another table or she forgot what they had and didn't even know they were missing it. I was expecting the food to taste amazing since it took forever to come out and I was wrong again!We asked for to go boxes and she forgot about that and so we reminded her twice and we never got them. It was basically pointless to ask again. The next time somebody invites me to go to this Cheesecake Factory I will definitely suggest someplace else.

I haven't been to the CCF in a long time so I was kind of itching to go. Since I was already shopping at FV mall I figured hey might as we'll stop by for dinner.  When we go to the hostess, they told us it would be a 50 minute wait. It was quite understandable though seeing as how it was Friday night and what not. We were willing to wait so we waited... It actually only took about 40 minutes for the two of us.  I loveeee their whole wheat bread!!!! I could just eat only that & be a happy camper. I know their secret! Molasses!! Yums. Anyway the service really sucked. The lady we had checked on all her other tables but ours -.- how rude. I kept staring at her to get we attention but had no luck. The food took pretty long to come out but it was so delicious. I got the garlic noodles with shrimp. I loved everything but the shrimp. It was very over cooked and when they deveined the shrimp the vein was still hanging on the shrimp.. Ugh gross. Btw I am sometimes allergic to shrimp & guess what? I'm allergic to the shrimp they used here ): I broke out in hives about 30 mins after finishing my meal. Sad. No more shrimp from Cheesecake Factory for Dianna.  Overall the food was pretty good. I love their fried Mac n cheese balls. We really wanted to get a piece of cheesecake but we were so gosh darn full! I love the portions here! You always have left overs lol. The Chinese chicken salad is also a favorite!  Verdict: don't get the shrimp it's cooked very poorly. But I guess that depends on the chef & it's not quite in your control.

I wondered if it would be as good as I remember them being since my palate has matured quite a bit in my major foodie phase the last 6 yrs or more. I also wondered if my foodie bf who just moved here from NY and wasn't familiar with this place, would enjoy it.  Yes! It was surprisingly good. Possibly one of the better chicken piccatta's I've had! And I am quite picky about my piccattas. Angel hair was cooked perfectly. The piccatta sauce was creamy, flavored very tastily and it had little lemon slices on top where they scored the outer skin. I cut them up and gobbled them with the chicken which was so velvety soft, it didn't need a knife to cut it at all. So deloosh!! Lunch portion was still huge! Something they're known for, big portions. It was around $12 I think.  The bf ordered some pasta with sausage and shrimp in a red sauce and really liked it too. I took a bite and thought the shrimp was cooked perfectly and I would order this dish myself.   My old favorite, the avacado eggrolls with tamarind-cashew dipping sauce hasn't changed a bit even though I have. They were super yummy we both thought.  Service was pretty good too. We walked in at 1 pm on a Sunday afternoon after going to the AMC theaters and I knew it would be crowded and it certainly was.

The Cheesecake Factory is notorious for having some of the most calorie loaded meals. Do we outlaw these restaurants? No, we come once a year or embrace obesity. I'm still deciding myself. They have some decent appetizers. The avocado eggroll is probably my favorite. The tamarind sauce is very tasty and overall it's a unique dish. I almost always order a pasta here and if you know me at all I'm a HUGE gluten sensitive pasta freak. Their pastas have never disappointed me and I've been to multiple factories on the East and West coast and have tried almost all of them. The great thing about CF is that they are really standardized and you get the same dish wherever you go. Of course, no meal is complete at the CF without some cheesecake. Sometimes I am tempted to get the big ol' fancy ones with like 8 ingredients: chocolate, caramel, nuts, cream, raspberries, turtles etc, but I've learned the best ones are always the really simple ones.

His family didn't even car that this child kept hoping up & down on the seats! Nor the fact that he kept putting his head near my lap then when he flipped over he kicks me on my leg with his feet as he laid down again but in the opposite position! I thought giving a stare at the teenage daughter would give her a sign to tell her family to handle him. But, all they do is say something to him in Spanish, & he gets up then does it all over again! It was just a very uncomfortable, no space to breathe & talk type of dinner. I just really wanted to enjoy my dinner with my boyfriend tonight but instead I was just super upset the entire night..  Overall, great food from a guy named Damon B. He was very helpful with what to get for an appetizer, always checking up & honest about where the tips go to.

She doesn't have a Cheesecake Factory where she currently lives and she wanted to eat here. So we went in and asked how long the wait and was told we could be seated right away. We were seated in the ""bar"" area. We had to wait 10 minutes before our server, Brian, came and introduced himself and took our drink order. It was another 5-7 minutes before our sodas arrived delivered by another server. In the 17 or so minutes we were there the two tables on either side of us were empty, seated and then they had received their drinks AND bread basket. I had to flag another server to get a bread basket and it was brought right away..piping hot..yea. We waiting a few more minutes and Brian returned took our order and dissapeared. In the meantime, the tables to the left and right of us had received their food orders.  After about 25 minutes I went to the hostess and requested a manager. About 3 minutes later Sean, who said he was the manager to came to the table. I explained the situation and stated that we had been waiting over 30 minutes for our food.  He said he would go to the kitchen and check on the status and would return. He left and returned about 5 minutes later.  He said that out food order had been placed 17 minutes earlier and that the one dish needed 20 minutes to prepare.  He said he would look at the ticket and see what could be done for compensation due to the circumstances.   And gave us a new server. She was super. I was disappointed when our food arrived. It wasn't as hot as it should have been given that it was supposed to have been prepared on the fly. When it came to the bill, all that was combed was a $6.95 piece of cheesecake.   I expected the meal to be better. I should have been combed the entire meal since it took 45 minutes to arrive to the table and the other inconveniences.  However, I ended up paying $40 for a less than mediocre meal and less than any service.  We never saw Brian except to carry a tray with bread baskets from one computer station to another after our complaint.  Shame on you Cheesecake Factory.  I won't be returning...ever and neither will my family or friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=420

My wife reminded the waitress she didn't want salt and the waitress apologies and said she would have it changed. Unfortunately the new drink tasted salty. Obviously the bartender simply poured the first drink w/salt into a new glass, unacceptable. I've eaten here a few times before, but won't be returning in a hurry.

Although I'm a big fan of their food, their treatment makes me not want to come back here ever again and this has happened many times, this is not the only time. The receptionists have the worst attitude, especially a girl named Mina with the long hair, she made us feel not welcomed.

Despite the name it's also a dining restaurant with a lunch and dinner meny. The meny is really broad and you can get pasta, fish, salads, pizza, steaks, burgers, sandwiches and of course cheesecakes. I usually go for the Oreo cheesecake and I recommend this masterpiece! If you want to finish a dinner dish and a cheesecake I suggest you arrive hungry but you can always split one with a friend!  I been to some resturants around Cali' and the quality stays the same!

It was very, very crowded, which was expected. I'm writing this because although it was super hectic and chaotic, I didn't see one employee/server/host lose it. I thought that was really impressive. Everyone was super nice and patient! My favorite cheesecake is the raspberry white chocolate truffle and dulce de leche caramel. I also love their cocktail drinks and pasta.

This time was the last straw. I'm not coming anymore, and any group that invites me, I will let them know that we should go somewhere else because I am not going there again.  Here are the details, I walked through the crowded dingy mass of people waiting hopelessly for a table, past the sign that says these walls are cancer-causing, and eat here at your own risk. I make it finally to the hostess desk, where the unfriendly group of girls looks me over then says the wait for four people is about 45 minutes. ""But come back in 20 for a pager."" So they want us to stand in line, put our names down, go away, come back, wait in line, get a pager, go away, and when they ring the pager, to come back wait in line, and then be pushed into an awkward clump of people in some random aisle, until our waiter arrives.

The table next to us even called a manager over to complain about the service.  Almost every customer that was dining with our server was waiting a substantial amount of time for just their drinks as we did.  The table behind us had a different server and was served right away before other tables who arrived first with our server. I work in the hospitality field as well as customer service so I know what the pressure feels like when it's busy. I felt bad and gave the server the benefit of the doubt. However, a majority of the time I didn't even see her around. When she was tending to other diners right next to us, she didn't even look our way and when she did, she didn't apologize for the wait or acknowledge it.

The food was dropped off and I got my undercooked steak, mashed potatoes and green peas so after 15 minutes of waiting for the waiter to show up  again and asked what happened to the broccoli and he said that he didn't know that it came with green peas and he would bring it up to me right away. 20 minutes later the broccoli was still cooking.

She apologies, a manager comes over to apologize (mentions how often they spray for bugs, etc). I don't make a big deal, I just ask for a new napkin.  After our appetizer (edamame which was the best part of dinner), we are waiting & waiting for our meal. About 45 minutes later both dishes (side of meatballs & chicken di pane) come out and they are cold. After waiting that long how could they be cold? The meals go back and after another 20 minutes they arrive. The food is fine, not great, nothing special.  Upon receipt of the check, nothing was deducted and no offer for a complimentary dessert. I mean after finding bugs on your table, waiting over an hour for your meal and initially having it served cold, couldn't you at least offer a free dessert or comp some part of the check??

I don't know why or if it was Bc I had my son with me & wanted to sit us in an area in the back. I was frustrated & angry. It's not like my son needed a high chair or a booster seat so any seat would've been fine for us 3. After waiting for almost 2 hours with my son hungry and whining, they finally took us in.

At one point in time I didn't mind the long wait and elevated prices for a decent dining experience at this location, but slowly it's slipped down a slippery slope. I still do (unconditionally) love the avocado egg rolls but just about everything else seems to have gone way downhill.  The half chicken was at one point of time one of my faves but the last time I ordered it, it was bland and certainly lived up to the rule of ""don't order the chicken."" I loved ordering the chicken! The prices can no longer be justified with such a decrease in quality but the service has always been nothing short of fantastic. Besides the time the manager blew me off with a ""what do you want me to do about it"" answer when dealing with an undercooked pork chop, I can't complain about anyone who has ever touched the table during any of my visits. Training in the front of house still seems to be a priority but behind the scenes has definitely suffered. It's a shame to see a restaurant that at one time aimed for excellence regardless of their size to take such a turn.

Throughout the rest of the meal we all just felt a negative attitude as she clearly didn't want to wait on us. I Come to Cheesecake at least once a month and they always take care of us. We ask for separate bills and they always handle it with no issues and we always leave nice tips. When we asked her, she complained about it and said she would see what she could do. She came back with a full check and a pen and asked us to tell her how much money we want on each card which is not splitting the check for us at all. We easily could have done that without asking for separate checks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=460
Rene P.,"San Diego, CA",70,57,63,4.0,8/20/2015,"Went last Friday on a first date with a lady friend. It was busy as expected but nothing substantial...perhaps 20 mins, at the most. We were seated and served by Kim. I ordered the Pit Beef Dip with fries. The sandwich was a little smaller than I expected but flavorful! The cheese was perfectly melted and so when I dipped the sandwich into the au jus; the meat, cheese, carmelized onions and bun, all were in perfect sync. The fries were nicely seasoned and with a nice snap too! I also gotta give props to Kim. She was very attentive and personable, with a great smile! :) She definitely made a great night even better!  I'll definitely be ordering this meal again and asking for Kim.

Well, I'll keep it short.  Been here many more times I'd care to admit, and I can't say I wouldn't recommend - because I would ...it's a lot of food, but it's food that is good.   Few of my favorites that have made my ""go-to"" list:  Miso Salmon (lunch portion is plenty big),  the Classic Burger which is a huge chop house burger that you will find hard to compare to other restaurant style burgers.  Pasta Davinci (the marsala sauce and mushrooms are tasty) and of course the cheesecakes seem to all be winners...I like the Carrot Cake Cheesecake and I think it's called the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream cheesecake.  Kudos to this restaurant for drastically improving their table seating availability by opening up the patio with comfy patio dining tables/chairs and warm heaters well appointed to keep you warm.  Come on an afternoon and it's a really nice atmosphere they've created on that patio.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=460

Marta S. was not only proficient, friendly and helpful but offered to take our picture several times. The Cheesecake Factory should feel lucky to have her in their employ. There were a couple of servers to help serve our food. I had ordered the Viet Namese spring rolls which were fresh, light and very tasty. I also had the Angel hair pasta with shrimp. The pasta was tasty and not covered in tomato sauce but diced tomatoes which made it very light to eat. However, and this is why the 4 stars, the shrimp was way overcooked.

Amber B.,"El Cajon, CA",4,7,2,1.0,9/3/2016,"So disappointed this point around. Everything started out great, with the service and the appetizers. We had ordered our food and for being a busy Friday night we were expecting things to take a while, so we weren't upset when they did. The reason I am giving this place 1 star tonight is because I had ordered the ""Chicken Picatta"" a Cheesecake classic, I had specifically asked for it be without capers because I tend to always get sick when I eat them and I repeated it to the waitress so she understood correctly. Our food comes out 25 minutes later and of course my chicken has capers on it. I was so hungry I had to take a bite of the piece of chicken with the least amount of capers. She took it back and 15 minutes passed, she brought it back and it did not look appetizing what so ever. As I mentioned before, I had taken a bite out of one piece of chicken. On the new plate they gave me, it was the same exact chicken but WASHED under water.... What kind of restaurant reuses poultry??? I was so upset I couldn't even take another bite. The manager didn't even do anything about this issue all she said was ""can i offer you something new"".. She didn't even apologize for the chicken being reused or anything. I will never make my way back to Cheesecake Factory and I know I won't be missing out either. Their food has become so mediocre and plain.

Jenna R.,"Post Falls, ID",0,14,,3.0,6/14/2015,"Normally this location has been a Better overall experience,  hence the three stars. Today would have been one or two stars otherwise. We went on a Sunday at 12:30 and got seated promptly outside, however they smashed all the tables so closely together that peoples elbows and purses were constantly floating over our table.  We ordered our two sodas and the fire roasted artichoke. The waitress said they had been having issues with the artichokes but if it was fixed she'd put it in for us which she ended up doing.  When we got our Bread our waitress only brought out the brown bread. No big deal and she brought out the sourdough after but just another thing that went wrong. When the artichoke came out it was so hard that we couldn't take off a leaf without it snapping. We let our waitress know and she said she'd put in another one. The manager then came out and said all the artichokes were hard. So no appetizer for us. My husbands lunch was the Carolina pulled pork which he said was good. My garlic noodles were horrible. First off I ordered the dinner portion not lunch and the serving I got barely covered the bottom of the plate. Second there was no garlic in it. There was hardly any taste at all. I had to douse it with salt to taste anything.  Third after each bite my mouth was coated with what felt like lard. After four or five bites I had to stop. As we sat waiting for our check my stomach started feeling nauseous which I attribute to the noodles. Like I said normally this location is pretty good, but if you go on the weekends or if its busy watch out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=460

Nathan K.,"San Diego, CA",63,78,13,1.0,1/6/2016,"Absolutely horrid experience last week during New Year's. Checked in at the front of house and were told the wait was 10 minutes for a table. We were pleased because the place was busy. The buzzer we had went off within 5 minutes. So things were looking good. After we turn in the buzzer, they completely dropped the ball. We waited patiently right next to the front desk while others who came in well after us were seated, one by one. After about 20 minutes, I checked status. Apparently, our name somehow disappeared from their system. They put us on stand by and we had to wait 20 more minutes for a total of 40. We wanted to leave at that point but we were so hungry that we felt compelled to stay. Things got worse. We were seated at one of the worst tables in the joint outside, right next to the server POS. We weren't even acknowledged by a server for at least 10 minutes. When we were, it was some middle aged, apathetic gentleman who seemed to want to be anywhere other than work. No charm or engagement whatsoever. The food was fine. But awful customer service all around. Ruined the entire visit and may motivate us to boycott for a while. Just a shame.

Emy M.,"San Diego, CA",90,352,994,4.0,5/22/2015,"Date of visit: 5/17/2015 Cheesecake Factory has an overwhelming menu, so I always just get the Spicy Jambalaya Pasta with chicken and shrimp. It's spicy and has pasta, so I'm pretty content. I had a bad experience here once with a worm in my lettuce wraps, so I pretty much stick with the pasta and a piece of strawberry cheesecake if I need that extra splurge. Normally I would give this place 3 stars, but after my experience on Sunday, I needed to comment on how awesome our waitress was. Since Cam's mom was in town, we all wanted to go out for a nice dinner with her. We were also with Cam's sister and her two babies, so we packed them all up in the car and decided to go out for dinner (warning: bad decision). By the time we're seated, it's an hour to bedtime for the one year old, so he's a fussy mess. Banging spoons on the table, crying, acting out, etc. I'm super embarrassed, but our waitress (our heroine) was extremely patient and tried to help by bringing out bananas, juice, a high chair, and anything else that was asked of her. I thought that Cheesecake Factory had kids menus with crayons, but my memory must be failing me.  My food was typical - it's always the same and never fails me, but the service from our waitress was outstanding. The only issue I had this visit was that the hostess told me that a table would be ready in 5-10 minutes, but it really took 30 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=480
Joshua A.,"San Diego, CA",295,46,96,5.0,3/11/2015,"I can't find one reason why I wouldn't rate this restaurant 5 stars. Rosani, our waitress for the past two times eating here, is absolutely amazing.  I suggest that you ask for her to be your waitress because of the following: -reliable recommendations based on cravings, popularity, & protein of choice. -genuine and friendly service from beginning to end. -constantly checks up on you and refills your water -makes your experience at Cheesecake personable and enjoyable. 5 star service!! I don't think I would want any other waiter. The food was equally amazing! For an appetizer, we ordered the Ahi Carpaccio. It is raw tuna topped with house dressing with avocado and cucumbers on the side. It also comes with a sweet and tangy sauce you can pour over it to add more flavor. For our entrees, we ordered the Chicken Madeira and the Breaded Parmesan Chicken. The chicken Madeira was served with mashed potatoes and was topped with melted cheese and mushrooms and a sauce closely tasting like Marsala. The two chicken breasts were cooked perfectly and I usually don't like mushrooms but they were a perfect match. The breaded chicken tasted similar but was crispy! This was served with mash potatoes and salted asparagus. Had I known they would taste similar I would've ordered something different for a change of taste.  During previous visits here we've had the spicy chipotle BBQ pasta and the seafood gumbo. BOTH WERE DELICIOUS and paired perfectly together to share!

We finished off with the mango and key lime cheese cake and raspberry lemon cheese cake for dessert to bring home.  We really liked the mango and key lime cheese cake, it was light and tasty.  Service was ok, nothing to brag or complain about. Cheese cake was a Little pricey at $8 bucks a slice. Lunch cost about double my gift certificate, but at least half of it was covered. Kind of like finding money in your pocket when you are doing the laundry! It was my wife's first time here, she did not realize they had a good variety of food other than cheese cakes.

Erin D.,"Houston, TX",14,905,882,2.0,5/2/2014,"I know what you're saying - the Cheesecake Factory? Why go there? The answer: It's the only place to eat (aside from PF Chang's) close to where I was working. FYI don't follow the signs to the Cheesecake Factory if you enter off of Fashion Valley drive. It's faster and shorter to go in the opposite direction of the signs.  Parking was horrendous, which I suppose is expected at a mall. If you've only got 30 minutes for lunch, forget it. You will spend at least 20 minutes trying to find parking. There is a parking garage behind the Cheesecake Factory. If you want to park on the first floor, it's $3. However, if you're willing to go up and down some stairs, you can park for free on the second or third levels. To enter the free parking part (because the garage has two separate entrances for paid and non-paid), enter RIGHT behind the cheesecake factory. I have never seen a split parking garage before. Usually everyone in the garage pays the same price (or it's completely free). Because parking was such a pain, I called to ask about the wait time. The guy who answered said there was no wait. Upon arrival, there was a 5 minute wait. This doesn't seem long, but if you're on a timed lunch break (thankfully I was not), keep this in mind. I ordered the pizza and salad lunch special. The green salad already comes with a viniagrette, so be aware. I got the supreme pizza with everything (sans olives) on it, and it was pretty decent. I could only eat half of the salad and half of the pizza, so the lunch portion is still generous. The table next to me ordered salads, and I thought they were HUGE. Overall, the Cheesecake Factory is not my favorite place to eat. I probably should've ordered a cheesecake, but there was no time. My bill was $14.91 including tax and tip. I suppose that's not too bad for lunch, and I was able to take half of the pizza home.

Marvin S.,"San Diego, CA",689,493,1263,4.0,1/31/2014,"I just realized through my insane writing of my Yelp reviews today that I did not include a very long overdue update for one of my favorite places to eat in San Diego, The Cheesecake Factory! Okay, so lets get some of the negatives out there, in case you didn't know. It's located in Fashion Valley. The parking is horrendous most of the times. Their customer service is spotty. When it's busy, there will be a long wait, period. Seriously, go eat somewhere else. The portions are huge, so you eat way too much, which means too many calories and you get fat. The place is surely not where you want to go on a budget. With that all being said, coming here for me has always been about the special occasion. Call me a huge sap, it just is what it is for me. What's great about it is that this place can seat a pretty huge party when carefully thought out. Now I'm not saying the wait will be any less and in fact they don't take reservations until 11am, I believe. Their menu is very expansive and they do a lot of it very very well! Easy to please a group of people that want it all! This last visit, my wife and I came after she got off work and I had just taken leave from transferring off the Gridley. I was very pleased that there was no wait on a weeknight and we got seated immediately. One thing I noticed was the seating outside had been upgraded. Yeah, I asked to sit outside to enjoy our San Diego winter! Once we got out there, I noticed that there seemed to not be an uncomfortable booth or chair in sight. We asked to be moved once because one of the heaters did not reach to my seat. DAMN, eating outside with the heaters on you and the very very nice comfortable seats set the mood just right on the night. I loved it! As far as our meal, I had the tried and true Chicken Madeira with all aspargus and my wife had a small caesar salad with shrimp, both of which were great! Her shrimp was grilled and was cooked perfectly. My dish was delish, as always and I believe the best dish here! We pretty much split the Chicken Madeira since my knew if she didn't get any at first, that I would eventually destroy it by myself in record time! Our service was way better than normal on this occasion, as they were all so attentive. I'd love for it to stay this consistent! Oh, of course we got a slice of cheesecake.

Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4069,28010,4.0,9/1/2013,"I actually enjoyed my lunch more than I thought I was going to. The only problem was at the beginning when the hostess sat me at a section, where unbeknown to her, the server for that section was late to work; so after a bit of a wait, I had to flag down a waitress from another section to take my order. She was very kind, sympathetic, and more than willing to help out. Her name was Claudia. Thank you Claudia! I was on a lunch break so I did not get all involved with my order, so I quickly ordered the Ahi Tartare for $6.95, featured on their SkinnyLicious menu, (  a good price, and the Skinny Chicken Salad Sandwich for $9.95 which came with a small spring salad ( ).  The meal started out with their staple table bread, a white baguette and a wheat loaf which were very good buttered or not. ( ) Next, the Ahi Tartare arrived nicely piled on a bed of ripe chopped avocado drizzled with a soy ginger sesame sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds. ( ) It was a very light and refreshing portion. The tartare was very good and had no fishy favor what so ever. The little crispy sliced wontons were an excellent vessel to eat it with. ( ) The soy ginger was light and had a subtle flavor that did not overrun the Ahi and avocado. The chicken salad sandwich came served on some brioche and the tender all white meat chicken was mixed with roasted almonds, mayonnaise, some scallions, and served with sliced tomatoes and lettuce. ( ) The chicken salad was well balanced from its seasoning, to the amount of chicken, almonds, and mayo. ( ) The flavor was mild and enjoyable. The spring salad was simple, but the slightly acidic vinaigrette was very good.

Vivian V.,"San Diego, CA",64,187,118,5.0,3/15/2015,"The only problem with this place is that it's incredibly busy on weekend nights. The upside is that the extensive patio has lots of heaters and is a lot more comfortable to sit in the waiting by the bar for a table to open up. My favorite foods to eat here are the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and I like the bowtie pasta with roasted garlic and chicken, and the chicken Madeira is very good as well. The pizzas are awesome as well and good for the picky eaters in your group. To finish, white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is my jam. Service here has always been great. Love to order a Makers Old Fashioned at the bar. Some thinks I've tried I haven't like such as the thai cashew chicken which is marked as Spicy on the menu but is very mild. I didn't find this entree appetizing.

Geno P.,"San Diego, CA",131,656,303,3.0,6/5/2013,"This being a famous chain, I have no issue with agreeing with the Yelp consensus the Cheesecake Factory is a 3 to 3.5 Stars on any given day. It's A-OK and I still contend this place offers perhaps the largest menu of any second-tier chain. But if I could add a bit of value to reviewing this particular location: You should know parking and entrance are a bit awkward. Three sides of the property are completely fenced off because of renovations. If you attempt to park directly adjacent to the building, you are going to get boxed into a dead-end parking lot and it isn't pretty!!!

Of course, the free bread and butter allows you to peruse the menu for a while even if you're starving. Hahaha! My favorites here are the lettuce wraps, tuna tataki salad, their pastas and their steaks. This place is, of course, known for its huge portions and it's always a good idea to ask for a to-go box so you have room for one of their rich and delectable cheesecakes. Speaking of cheesecakes, they have a lot of varieties from the original to fruity to creamy and chocolaty. I usually get something with chocolate, but the banana cream and blueberry are also delicious. They also have other non-cheesecake desserts but I've never really tried them. The Cheesecake Factory is a popular place so be sure to plan ahead especially if you're eating during peak times.

Last time we ordered them inside, they were delicious. I was expecting possibly a few soggy ones or maybe room temp, since we live 10 min away, which I would not have minded at all, but this time they did not impress- skimpy on the cheese sauce!

Most scraps are brushed off into the floor so the birds can take care of it and the table beside us was barely wiped down and the buster spilled milk all over the seat but set the table. The milk can be seen dripping down the side of the seat and the host still seated a group of teenagers who didn't notice till they sat in it. The bathrooms are just as bad and overloaded with toilet paper and my wife was afraid to flush(just like the everyone before.) what's said is there was an employee in there wiping down the toilets when my wife went in there. But to top it all off the steak she ordered had a medium length hair in it. The waitress promptly took it back and returned with a steak that just happened to be on the grill. What's amazing is it had the same side cut she had put in it before returning. Unfortunately, it will be the last time we attend.  She works at the health department so it wont be the last time someone from inspections doesn't know.

Janelle J.,"San Diego, CA",164,97,40,4.0,7/9/2012,"First and foremost, this place is a chain restaurant. Not only that, it's POPULAR and located at a MALL. What do people expect? Saying that much, if you're coming here during dinner rush and expecting to get seated quickly AND then come on yelp to complain about it...well...let's just say I'm laughing at you and not with you. Come here for an early lunch (when they open) or for an earlier dinner before 6pm. It's been a few years since I've come to this location, but we arrived at 5:30 and got seated right away. We tried the Stuffed Mushrooms. I enjoyed that my appetizer actually came before the main dish. So many of these chain restaurants get that part wrong. Anyways, they were pretty decent. The wine and parmesan flavors complemented each other, but it was a tad bit on the salty side. They added a ""skinny"" menu for people who want to be calorie cautious...although nothing on the menu seems to be lower than 600 calories. Nonetheless, I tried the Skinnylicious Chicken Salad Sandwich. I enjoyed it as it was light on the mayo. The bread was lightly toasted and quite tasty. I'm ate only a third of the salad, but that's not because it was bad. I'm just not a fan of arugula and endive. It came with a standard vinaigrette.  My husband got the Teriyaki Chicken dish. He enjoyed it quite a bit. And like everyone has been saying...the portions are HUGE. I took a bite and it was tasty as well...all the tang and sweetness expected in a teriyaki dish. I didn't finish my sandwich and left some room for cake. How could we not have some?! We went for the 30th Anniversary cake. It was pretty decadent. Cheesecake tends to be too rich for me, so I enjoyed this cake. It has layers of chocolate fudge cake and cheesecake.

She simply just handed us our menus and left.  For entrees, we had their Pasta Da Vinci and their Louisiana Chicken pasta. My friend's Pasta Da Vinci was about 1/4th smaller than my boyfriend's Pasta Da Vinci. I'm guessing they are not really consistent in terms of how much food they plate each time. I had their Louisiana Chicken pasta and it was a bit too flavorful and salty for my taste. The chicken was also really really thin - almost a sliver.  The worst part of my experience was our waitress. She was never around and was not really friendly towards us. In addition, she never offered to refill our water cups and because it was so hard for us to find her, we eventually did not even bother asking.  When it came time for dessert, we ordered two cheesecakes and it took out waitress almost 10 minutes to get them. I am not sure why plating two cheesecakes would take ten minutes but it somehow did.

And big chunks that are hard to chew. It almost looked comical when it came out. I was like seriously guys? The ceaser salad on the side was poor too. Old stale croutons, and the dressing is forgettable.  I also had fried catfish the last visit....omg no. Do not get this. I could only eat the mashed potatoes.

The waitress took almost 30 minutes to take our order.  She told us she was going to bring us bread, but never did.  Didn't come around to fill my empty water glass.  Waitress had a snotty attitude.  Coffee was cold.  When she delivered our artichokes, the heart was cut out of them!   What good is an artichoke without a heart, for that is the best part.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=540
Becky F.,"San Diego, CA",157,4,,5.0,9/9/2016,"A close girlfriend and I decided to go out for a night on the town. After a wonderful night of laughs we decided to get a nightcap at fashion valleys own Cheesecake Factory. Our outside seating was perfect, there was heaters spaced out with candles to set the mood. After some long deliberation over the copious amount of cheesecake on the menu, we asked our server Jennie for her recommendations. She asked what we liked and gave us different suggestions, eventually we settled on the classic strawberry cheesecake. The simplicity of the original cheesecake paired perfectly with our vanilla ice cream and crisp strawberry topping. The taste of this dessert was good but the dessert paired with the exceptional service from our server Jennie, was what really made this experience unique and memorable. Jennie was attentive, sweet, and charming. I recommend anyone in the area looking for a fine experience and mouthwatering cuisine to come to the Cheesecake Factory and request to sit in jennie's section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=540
Cynthia Q.,"El Cajon, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/4/2017,"I started going to the cheesecake factory in January 2017 and so far I have visited 10 times including today. Out of those 10, 3 were above and beyond great, 6 were around average maybe less but today. Today was the worst. I called a head of time to let them know a party of 8 celebrating a birthday with 4 kids under the age of 8 and wanted to be seated outside away from bothering people eating late lunch early dinner (reservation was around 130). I get I had to wait when we got there ( we arrived 10minutes early) and were seated about 15 minutes later. The waitresses was nice so far so good , got our drinks have is time to look at the menu and order. All of this was great, it wasn't busy but not calm in the restaurant. While waiting for our food to arrive we were introduced to Paul who was supposed to be our waiter but had been on lunch. Well this is where it all went down hill. We had asked for the umbrella to be closed because it was windy we didn't have any of their fancy heaters near by and the sun was rather nice on the skin rather than burning. We're told one of the busboys would close it (they never came) we received our food 40+ minutes later (almost 230 by now) and it was cold ( fried chicken tenders with fries for the kids and my spicy chicken chipotle pasta) and still no sight or interaction with Paul since our introduction. 20 minutes later (seriously we eat rather fast or maybe starving from all the wait) still no Paul, no closed umbrella, freezing cold , empty plates and waiting for the check. Another 20 minutes or so we finally see Paul where at this point forget a whole cake for birthday I want to get to my car and get warm. Got the bill left the money I was over it. This whole entire time I saw other waiters dedicating their time on their designated tables (not rush hour yet ) and constantly making sure they were ok and my family was just THERE..... I for sure will not be stopping by to this location any time soon I rather wait for a table at red lobster where I know I will be given my food right out of the oven and actual be bothered by my waiter for constantly asking if I need a refill than coming back here. I wish you good luck to those who decide to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=540
Angie S.,"Castro Valley, CA",266,192,64,2.0,12/6/2014,"Yeah yeah yeah, how can we expect great flavors from a chain restaurant like Cheesecake Factory? Until today, i hadnt been to a Cheesecake Factory since high school, which was nearly 5 years ago! The days when we'd bop around the mall for hours and eat here with our obnoxious yellow Forever 21 shopping bags and order virgin daquiris. Embarrassing! Anyways, after December Nights we were in the romantic holiday mood and had some time to kill before our 10:45 movie so we decided to come here. The only reason i didnt give 1 star is because our server, Marshall was so polite and on top of his stuff. He checked up on us frequently and cracked some jokes and made the experience a lot better. We ordered the fettucine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and the shrimp scampi and steak diane combo. I also had a pineapple moscow mule. The food was really below average. I probably would have been happier with my food at a Dennys or something.  The fettucine was pretty okay but it was way to saucy and the sun dried tomatoes were just plopped right on top of the pasta. The combo meal was a whole 'nother diasaster. Everything was strangely spicy and salty yet extremely bland at the same time. The shrimp was so peppery and the batter on the shrimp tasted like pure flour. The sauce was sooo incredibly bland yet i could not stop drinking water which means there had to have been so much salt in them! I asked for the steak diane to be cooked medium but they came back soo overcooked and past well done and the sauce on them was dreadful. Lastly, the combo came with mashed potatoes but they were hardened and cold by the time they got to me. The pineapple moscow mule was alright but there was no ginger or lime flavor. It just tasted like pineapple and vodka. Pretty dissapointing for $10.  Honestly, after tonight i definitely remember why i have not come here in over 5 years. It is extremely overpriced and the food is just not good! The service was great, but if im going to pay over $50 for dinner, i'd rather go somewhere with food that is more palatable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=540

I got a table quickly because I came by myself. I had the skinny cosmo and chicken samosas small plate. Both were amazing! Samosas were under 490 calories. I sat in the patio next to a heater and it wasn't too loud. Definitely family friendly. Everything I ordered was great and came quickly.

Lol jk! haha, but hey it is an excuse to go out and eat and what not! We came here on a weekday for lunch. No wait or line. Score! Our orders: Mine: Lemon Half chicken w/ sides of carrots and mashed potatoes (around $15) - Tasted exactly like rotisserie chicken that you can get from costco. Not as tender as costco though. It had like a raw texture to it, but it looked cooked. It was good because I love rotisserie chicken but for $15, I could've bought 3 big whole chicken from costco. Nothing special about this dish at all. My awesome mashed potatoes could beat cheesecake factory's any day. His: Factory burger (around $10) - It was served in a baguette which I found pretty weird. But my boyfriend said it was good, but for me, it was average.  Cheesecakes: both around $8 Mine: My all time fav, Red velvet cheesecake! AHHH!!! 1million calories of deliciousness. If I was to die tomorrow, I am demanding to eat a whole cake of this thing. Never fails to disappoint me.  His: fresh banana cream cheesecake. It had bavarian cream on top and the cheesecake filling tasted like bananas w/ fresh cut up bananas. It was yummy! and now the bf's favorite.  Now, the reason why I only gave this 3 stars wasnt just because of the average food. It was also our server. Wasnt friendly at all and had a little snooty attitude. No extra tip for that guy!

Now I'm not saying that is a bad thing but it leaves little to discuss when trying to say something that you haven't read before. The best part about Cheesecake Factory is you never need to decide as a group or even a couple what you want to eat, their menu will satisfy all.  The food and service is never bad, but it is never deserving of a fantastic rating or high praise. So is that a good thing? yeah actually, every chef will tell you that consistency is everything when running a restaurant and at least The Factory has it.

Anyways, we sat outside and it was peaceful. It was lovely too! I ended up leaving so satisfied.  The second time I came here for my birthday was in 2014.. Okay, everything was good. My boyfriend and I only waited for about five minutes. We had to sit inside which kind of suck to be honest. It was so loud and it was hard to have a conversation with my boyfriend without yelling. Okay, so we had this waiter and he was too much! He talks way too loud and it's just hard to explain. I just know when a waiter/waitress is being over the top and is too much. Anyways, aside from all of that.. The food is still amazing and enjoyable! I suggest you try the fries, haha. It's surprisingly good!

I also remember their cheesecake slices for $10 a pop being more generous in size but now frankly it just isn't worth it to go here.  My friend ordered the Tex Mex eggrolls and we were surprised to hear that they ""ran"" out of it. I guess this must mean it comes from a pacakge then instead of being made at the restaurant?

Conrad R.,"San Diego, CA",1354,727,15270,4.0,11/8/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant juggernaut that has secured a foothold in almost every major US city with people who are still willing to wait for an hour just to get a table. I've been to a handful of various locations on both coasts, and for all the yelp downplay or venomous reviews, CF continues to flourish.  We had dinner with some friends and of course there is a wait because the restaurant needed to accommodate our birthday party of 12, which is plenty of time to peruse the bakery counter, drool over the selections, and gasp over the amount of aerobic exercise needed to burn off the calories per bite in a single slice.  When we got seated, our server went over the specials and took our drink & appetizer orders. I was feeling nostalgic, so I went with the Well Mannered Dirty Martini, which was fine except the bartender failed to strain out a couple of ice chips. Not a perfect martini tonight, but it was still classy and dirty, just how I like it  .  I usually go with a saucy Chicken Madeira and/or Steak Diane [medium rare], but tonight I was feeling spicy, so I decided on the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Spicy is what I got in a heaping bowl of savory deliciousness. I wish they'd serve half-size portions because it's waay too much food  .  For people like myself who were brought up to clean off their plate, mega-portions really creates a dilemma in saving room for dessert. Next time, I'll try an appetizer or small plate, with a side salad, so I can enjoy some sweets. Their specialties are quite good, though.  For the record, I didn't get any cheesecake tonight, and the server boxed up my leftovers. But guess what?

Kat M.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA",20,12,,1.0,11/5/2014,"I have worked in restaurants for a long time. I've seen a lot, heard a lot, and I personally dine a lot.  Disclaimer: Consider yourself warned of The Cheesecake Factory Fashion Valley, the Chicken Madeira, and weird C grade service. You just never know what kind of problem solving abilities you will encounter. Here is my experience:  1. I approached the host stand. She did not make eye contact or greet me for over a minute. Prior to doing so she spoke with a co-worker who interrupted her consistent gaze at the computer screen. After her coworker spoke to her, she said hello to me. I smiled, ""Hello, two please."" She was polite. Just amazing that this generation does not prioritize greetings; we love looking into computer screens! Whatever no foul, just weird. 2. Sat down, greeted three minutes later, ordered 2 waters, a glass of wine, & a side salad. I asked for a glass of Pinot Noir, he recommended a wine. I look up the wine, I asked him the name he said, he repeated it, I couldn't find the name he said. I asked if it was there; he said ""I don't know it just came to mind."" Okkkk, ummmm? I order a glass that was actually on the menu. Weird.  3. 1 water served. I reminded him I wanted 2. He said he would bring it out when the other person in my party arrived, he said he didn't want the ice to melt. Ok- weird.  4. Waiter returns, I order, Chicken Madeira. It is my favorite & one of their most popular items. My boyfriend asked, ""Can I order from here?"" as he held up the small bites menu. Waiter's response, ""If you want,"" in a condescending tone. Odd? I can't assume to know his intentions. Food came quickly. Several bites in the waiter checks on us. 5. Next bite, the chicken is undercooked. Blood is present. I use the flashlight on my phone to verify. Yes in fact it was bloody, pink, chewy chicken! Undercooked.  I rationalize why the chicken could be undercooked; my hypothesis: The chicken is pounded to a thin piece for preparing; I'm sure it is a fine balance to not over cook the chicken, and in doing so it was undercooked. Understandable.  6. Waiter checks on us. I show him the bloody chicken, he takes it away. He's quick & hesitant to look at the meat in front of me, & a bit dismissive, probably trying to correct/minimize the complaint. He informed me a manager would come over.  7. Manager, ""Oh no, I'm so sorry, I'll fix that right away."" Im fine with that, yet surprised. Undercooked chicken is NOT GOOD. 8. Manager brings a new Chicken Maderia within 4 minutes. I thought, wow/fast. He disclosed that he pulled one off the line so I wouldn't have to wait. My thought: someone's food is now jammed up. I appreciated the prompt response.  9. I examine the plate, it was my first plate, re-plated; sloppy on the edges and re-dressed. They just put a new piece of chicken on it & I could see where I took a fork full of potatoes off of it from round 1. I'm hopeful the chicken was new & cooked. Cross contamination is now an issue. 10. I ate a couple bites, seems fine. Waiter checks on us. I'm good. I say thank you. Error sorta fixed, no big deal. 11. Few more bites. UNDERCOOKED again. My boyfriend also has a bite. Pink, chewy meat.  I cut open the meat, use the flashlight to verify; pink rubbery meat! Ok this is a foul! I have a food handlers card & I know everyone in that building has one too! That fine balance chicken preparation technique should have been corrected. 12. I cut into the other piece of chicken, it's already cut, the kitchen or manager checked to ensure it was not undercooked. My educated guess: It's probably a piece of chicken from my first plate. Maybe they thought, ""why waste the other piece of chicken?"" We'll cross cross contamination would be a really good reason to dump that first plate! Lazy, risky. NOT GOOD.  13. A new manager approaches, ""What happened?"" he asked. ""What are we doing for you?"" he asked. Did he really just ask me to solve his problem?! I respond, ""I don't know what happened, but I know that was not a new plate, & bottom line the chicken was bloody, & undercooked on 2 attempts. I don't trust that you even brought a new plate."" I should have asked him what he was going to do. I'm not hungry now, having consumed a portion of undercooked chicken that I will be glad to never eat again. Visions of food poisoning symptoms flashed through my mind. He informs me he is going to find out what happened. I never find out. He does not return. 14. Waiter offers a complimentary dessert. The cheesecake won't be bloody, right? Check is dropped, meal is comped, but my boyfriend's is not, $14.00 is the total. The waiter gets a 15% tip. He didn't make the food, but C grade service was provided. Conclusion: RAW/UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN x2. My experience was unacceptable & weird! Thanks for not requiring payment for the undercooked chicken meals. A comped side salad, a glass of wine, and slice of cheesecake sure helped with today's malaise!

I sat at the bar with a friend and was served by Lea D (or something like that). She seemed annoyed with anyone that spoke to her- whether a customer or another employee. After being seated for 5 minutes, ready to put in both our drink and food order, she approached the couple that was just walking up to the chairs next to us. She took their drink order. When I asked if we can put our drink order in, she said we could tell her when we were ready. I really didn't like her vibe, and I wasn't sure about coming back to this location, or at least the bar.  But, I can't resist the food. So, I came back the next weekend with the same girlfriend. We sat the same seats at the bar and was served by Elizabeth. She was excellent and truly knew how to treat her customers. She was busy as heck, but knew what proper customer service entailed. And for that, she got a $10 tip on a $17 meal. Thank you for making this experience better for me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=560

Michael B.,"San Diego, CA",7,30,70,4.0,8/6/2014,"The array of food and cheesecake is amazing. I've tried the majority of their cheesecakes and quite a few entrees on their menu and they're all delicious. The reason why I only gave 4 stars is due to the lack of consistency with their food and service. This location always seems to be busy but at times it's busy beyond belief. On those days, the quality of the food and service is definitely effected. There's been a couple of times where I've received my food and the order was wrong and/or the food was cold, and I mean it wasn't even warm. I guess it's ok since they make up for it with the amazing cheesecake that I MUST get after every meal. For entrees I suggest getting the Chicken Madeira or the Smokehouse BBQ Cheeseburger; amazing. The fried mac n cheese balls are a must for an appetizer and I'm personally partial to the pineapple upside down cheesecake; CRACK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=560

Yes, the wait was pretty long and there were tons of people inside waiting around for their buzzers to go off. BUTTTT  (here comes my big butt)... I was pleasantly surprised! First off, their complimentary WHEAT bread is amazingly soft and good. I think I must have made our server refill our basket several times.  I think I had the Jumbalya Pasta or something like that and it was good too! The portion was plenty enough for me to split it with a friend. There were some other dishes that I got to try off of my friends' plates... but all in all, I liked their food.  To top it off... their RED VELVET Cheesecake is just completely memorable!!! So memorable that I'm going to surprise my bf with it for his birthday. (it's in MAY) He's never tried it and I am pretty darn sure he's going to love it. That's a definite MUST TRY!!! Their Godiva Cheesecake was super rich... but I like rich...so I loved it too! Both are great to share.

Service and food combined. Hostess seated us right away but this comes down to the waitress. Her shirt was extremely dirty which was a turn off. Her phone was in her back pocket how does the management not see this? It took her a while to greet us and bring waters. Bread didn't taste fresh. Food was ok this time maybe it was a busy Sunday afternoon I'll let it slide.

We got to sit in the back and our waiter Grant S. was great. He was super attentive and super friendly. He is the main reason why I am yelping this place. He found out it was my birthday and wished me a happy birthday and after we ate dinner he asked if we wanted dessert. Everyone was super full and said no on the dessert since we had to go to downtown soon. He took it upon himself to bring me a sundae with a candle and sang happy birthday to me without being prompted by any of my friends. I thought this was great customer service. He went above and beyond, especially since the last time my friends and I went to a birthday dinner in January at a fancy place in Gaslamp we had horrible service, this was a great surprise and breath of fresh air.

Being that I normally only like to eat here during happy hours. Avocado Spring Rolls are amazing! The entree's we ordered that night 1 out of two were good.

As well as cheesecake. The GOOD: The outside area where we ate was great and had fire heaters the wait on our food was not long at all. The cheesecake was AMAZING!! Best I have had in a while the whole family loved it.  As far as the food.. Well it looked good... The BAD: There was an awful smell like they used old mop water to clean the floors, this was very unappealing right when your stepping in. The mugs they used need to be thrown away and buy new ones, also my wife's mug was dirty. The pasta had NO FLAVOR, is was bland, and all you could taste was oil. I was extremely upset about that. So I tried my wife's pasta...... Same it was just bad even with putting salt n pepper. I'm saying this again I'm extremely upset with the food here.

Although when some event happens (bday, celebations, friends gatherings) The Cheesecake Factory comes into play. I have tried this place many times in the past and each time is always good. I love their Lettuce Thai Wraps that they have for appetizers, alone it can serve as a lite meal as well.  Entrees it all depends on what you are in the mood for: sandwich, pastas, fish, beef, pork or chicken. Which ever is that you order i am sure its good.  They have ""Cold Apple Cider"" dont be fooled, its just ""Apple Juice"" and it comes in a short glass (no free refill) not worth it. Stick to water or Iced Green tea.  Cheesecakes: i have only ever tried Banana Cream Pie. Why? well IDK just when you are reading over and over all the different ingredients that are into one cheesecake my brain goes crazy and i start to see it as too sweet.

The service is usually decent here with the servers being semi attentive, varying heavily on your server.

I took a sip and thought it was overly sweet.  A couple minutes later, the owner delivered our food. My friend said her looked great. I thought mine looked a little too white of a flatbread.

My friend took a bite and she thought she tasted bleach...So the waitress came by again and asked about our food. We mentioned it.

We were all starving, but decided to wait it out (because we all love this restaurant). We were sat on the outside patio, which was fine by us. We were sat around 8pm, so the wait ended up being a little less than we had expected, but by the time our server actually showed up at our table, we might as well have waited outside.  Around 8:10, our server (I don't know his name because he didn't introduce himself), came to take our drink order. The Cheesecake Factory is known for their amazing bread, so I was excited to receive some with our drinks. Another 5 minutes went by and we did receive our drinks, but no bread. Then, the waiter told us he would ""be right back,"" but never returned. We ended up asking another server if we could have some bread, and he did not make any eye-contact with our table, said ""ya,"" and kept walking. Yes, the restaurant was busy, but that shouldn't take away from its customer service. A couple minutes later, our server came by and told us that they had ""changed their policy,"" and that the customers now need to ask for bread, and that's why he didn't bring any. I don't know if this is true or not, but I have been to a lot of Cheesecake Factory's, and none have expressed this ""policy."" Oh and by the way, he still didn't bring any bread at this point.  This is when everything went REALLY downhill.   Another few minutes went by, we finally got our bread, and our server took down our orders. At this point, it was precisely 8:24pm. I know this because we started to time how long everything was taking. Around 8:29, our server came back and told us that he didn't write ""legibly,"" and that he couldn't read what our orders were (WHAT?!). We proceeded to re-tell him our orders, and then asked for another basket of bread. He was a bit more on top of things at this point, and told us that the wheat bread was in the oven, and it wouldn't be out for another 10 minutes.  At about 8:45, the manager on duty came onto the patio and walked up to the table directly next to us to apologize for the wait. This party was seated about 20 minutes after we were, yet we were completely ignored. The manager brushed by us like we weren't even there. A couple minutes later, that table, that had come AFTER us, got their food (and a basket of the bread that was supposedly ""in the oven""). By that point, I was truly angry, but the story continues.  After 40 minutes of waiting, our food finally arrived. One of my friends got his food about 5 minutes before we did, but the rest of us received ours at the same time. We were all angry at this point, but we were so hungry that we all dug in. My boyfriend's burger was cold, like it had been sitting in a refrigerator for the past half hour. I was so angry that I didn't even want to eat my food anymore, and I went to talk to a manager about this terrible experience. Now, this was the same manager that had ignored us earlier, but I put that aside and explained the situation. I showed her to our table, and she asked the rest of the party what had happened, even though I had just told her everything. It was almost like she needed another witness to believe what had actually happened. She wasn't kind, but she apologized which I appreciated. However, she only offered to comp MY meal and gave us 3 free desserts. I was grateful for this, but my boyfriends burger was cold, which she knew, and she still didn't offer to have his meal comped. She only offered to re-make it. I don't know what was going through this woman's mind, but I think we deserved to have all our meals comped. After we saw our server and the manager deliberating right in front of us, our server came back with dessert menus, and never apologized.  We finally got our cheesecakes and left The Cheesecake Factory after 10PM. We got everything to-go, because we had no interest in eating our desserts there, and I especially did not want to ""celebrate"" by birthday there any longer. I know we were treated the way we were because we were a group of young adults. We clearly weren't respected in any way, yet we gave no reason to be disrespected. This is the worst experience I've ever had at one of these restaurants, and I will never be returning to this specific location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=620
Tina C.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,1,4.0,10/17/2014,"I visited Cheesecake Factory with two couples a few weekends ago on a Saturday at 7:30 pm. Because Fashion Valley is Fashion Valley, there of course was still a 30 minute wait. No worries - the weather is nice, and there is plenty of room to wait. We had several issue with our waitress during the course of our dinner. It wasn't over the top awful, but it was bad enough that I chose to write a comment on their website. Today I received a letter from the store manager assuring me that she personally dealt with the issue. She also recommended that the next time I come into the Cheesecake Factory that I should ask for a manager, just to ensure my visit ""is a wonderful one."" I am so impressed by this level of excellence in customer service that I had to come on here and post! Plus, as always, their food is on point.

Chris P.,"San Diego, CA",406,539,63,3.0,6/30/2014,I would call it a 3.5star spot.  White Chicken chili is very good but more like a rich gumbo.  The rice they give you in it is not enough to satisfy.  The chicken in it was cooked perfectly.

The experience feels slightly more elegant. The best part of Cheesecake Factory though, are the cheesecakes. I've had good pastas, and Chinese Chicken salad here. My experience with their other foods....not so good. We got the buffalo chicken wings as an appetizer, they were just ordinary wings I could have bought frozen and reheated from Costco. It came with 3 sticks of celery. We also tried the Steak Diane with Salmon combo - it was medallions of beef sauteed in a too strong sauce with mushrooms. How do I describe the sauce....too sweet, too savory...too much, not right. The salmon tasted overcooked and mushy. The few sprigs of asparagus it came with were a little hard on the bottom. The Steak Diane and Scampi combo was the same, only the Scampi was 3 lone shrimps cooked in an oily, too creamy sauce...the basil and tomato were cooked right in and much overdone. I could not taste it, and by cooking in the sauce that way, it didn't taste fresh. The combos are really not worth it. They don't do meat right. Stick with cheesecakes, salads, and maybe pasta here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=620

I even spoke to the manager and he really didn't seem to care and worse he didn't apologize either. Out of four meals all of them were very dry and disappointing. The Luau salad was extremely dry and the pasta was so bad when you tried to take a bite the entire portion stuck to your fork because of lack of sauce and the chicken was very dry, The pizza had almost no sauce on it so we tried to dip it in the extra cream sauce we requested but it was so cold and bland it didn't help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=620
Todd L.,"San Diego, CA",147,16,,4.0,3/9/2014,"This is one of my favorite places to go for dinner in San Diego. This is also the busiest location of the Cheesecake Factory I've ever seen. The reason they're not getting 5 stars from me is the wait to eat can be incredibly long. They don't take reservations so if you're going here at primetime, your wait could easily exceed 1 hour. There isn't a lot of waiting room either so plan on standing around or going shopping while you wait. This location is located in the Fashion Valley Mall in Mission Valley so there's plenty of shops nearby for your convenience.  The entire wait staff here wears all white which I kind of like. I've yet to see spots on any of the employees attire which shows you they care for a clean and tidy restaurant.  The menu is quite extensive. There's everything from pasta to seafood to burgers to Chinese food and tai dishes. They also offer a skinnylicious menu if you prefer to eat as healthy as possible when you eat out. They have a variety of options on this menu as well and that's more often than not what I order off of. Their prices are pretty cheap on the skinnylicious menu as well as you're typically getting a smaller serving of food. If you get their normal menu items, you get a ton of food. If you ever have any issues with your order the wait staff is very good at getting that taken care of and they all have been very friendly.  My tables of choice are in the bar area. If you're lucky enough to find an open table, just sit and avoid the wait. There are a few TV's in the bar which are nice if you can't go a meal without watching sports. They have a full bar so you can order a wide variety of drinks.  The bathrooms are some of the nicest I've seen in busy restaurants. They are always clean and tidy so you're not disgusted by just walking in.  Overall the Cheesecake Factory is a good deal for food and quality, and yes the cheesecake is good if you're looking for dessert to finish your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=620
Jeff L.,"San Diego, CA",157,219,69,3.0,2/22/2014,"Went to this location at the Fashion Valley Mall.  Although there was quite a line of people waiting, we got seated in 10 minutes - we only had 2 people in our group and we asked for first available. They sat us outside, but even on a chilly evening it was not a problem as the ratio of tables to heaters was almost 1-to-1.  With the flames glistening against my face, an enjoyable meal was ensured. Did you know that the Cheesecake isn't all about crap food anymore?  They have what they are referring to as their ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  It consists of items that are under a certain calorie content - for example there are pasta and meat dishes that all fall under 590 calories.   We got the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta.  It tasted really bland.  I wanted to dump a pound of cheese all over it to somehow improve the flavor.  Despite the low calorie count, it was still really filling.   The best part about the evening is that the bill wasn't crazy.  We both shared filling entrees and got out of there at $30 with tip.  Not too shabby! My only recommendation would be to skip the skinnylicious menu and go right for the Delicious menu.  Your stomach will thank you!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=620

Abraham T.,"San Diego, CA",18,28,36,2.0,11/11/2014,"Nice ambience, bit crowded but its to be expected on Veterans Day. Food was ok, nothing to brag about. My wife brought me here for my birthday and for being a veteran, i have to say, i ordered 1 mojito, cant say it was at all good, i figured maybe it was just watered down, so i ordered another, before I know it, i had 4 mojitos i didnt feel anything of a buzz. When I asked the waitress, nothing seemed to make sense. My only suggestions, food presentation was a bit sloppy, and lastly, if your going to charge $12-$15 for a mojito, its only FAIR the drink show for it. ""CONSISTENCY"" Maybe a bit of bar tending training is needed. The mojito was basically lemonade with mint and full of ICE.  Our time of visit was at 8:00pm 11/11 , the barkeep was a blonde female, hope that helps.

Joanie T.,"San Diego, CA",559,226,363,3.0,4/23/2015,"I came here on Monday with my sister for a late lunch after shopping at the mall. We came and got seated right away.  Our server was named Thomas. He was very nice but something seemed a bit off from him so let me explain. We asked for just the brown bread and he brought us those and then we were ready to order. So I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and my sister ordered a salad. She had asked him where the crab wontons were on the menu and as he bent over the table (...bending all the way down) he kinda clonk me in the head with his booklet he was holding. At the time I didn't want to say or make a big deal about it so I didn't say anything but my sister saw and laughed of course. So we get all our food and then I see him help another table and somehow he runs and almost fell pretty hard but caught himself on this big round table and goes ""ohhhh am I a clumsy person"". I really don't know how to ran into it that hard. I mean the distance from the big round tables to the others surrounded by it was a big gap.  All in all. By his movement, he seemed as if he was tired or maybe just too old for a fast pace company.  The fettuccine Alfredo was okay..I felt as if it was bland. The crab wontons were good. We also got the corn soup which was quite pleasant and was presented by Thomas so we got it. And the salad was delicious. We asked for Togo boxes and packed everything Togo and ended up leaving it behind on accident ):  But honestly, my whole visit that day I felt bad for the poor guy. ): He was a great server though and he did everything we asked and needed.

Dan P.,"San Diego, CA",65,303,3,1.0,8/1/2012,"Let me preface by saying that I don't like Cheesecake and I only went here because of a birthday dinner for my GF's sister. Waited 90 minutes for a table (why the heck don't these idiots at this kind of Chain restaurant take reservations?) on a MONDAY night because it was ""national cheesecake day"" even though no such thing actually exists.  Sat down and the waiter was quite friendly, but the table was a cheap outdoor one with really uncomfortable seats.   I ordered the Chicken Di Pana with a side of ""cheesy"" grits.  It also came with Broccoli.  Even though the plate was the size of a small table, the serving size of food itself was not exactly anything special.  The chicken was bland and flavorless, and despite the appearance of the breading, it was not in any way crunchy, which suggests to me that it was made earlier and then microwaved.  The broccoli was barely cooked and without any kind of flavor whatsoever. The ""grits"" were a joke.  They were honestly closer to Baby food than Grits.  There were actual corn pieces in it and yet no actual GRIT.  Seriously, it was corn-flavored mush with a few corn kernals and no taste of cheese.  Compare to the cheesy grits at ""The Americana"" in Del Mar and there is no comparison and they are the same price...and ""The Americana"" has better food. Oh yeah, and the manager said that because of the high demand for Cheesecake that night that they had to get the order for Cheesecakes 20 minutes in advance so they could be transported from the bakery...Hmm, I thought this was a cheesecake FACTORY.  Doesn't that imply that the cheesecakes are made in house? Overpriced, over-crowded, not-very-good food, SLOW service (the guy was nice, but my water sat empty for the last half of the meal and we spent 15 minutes trying to flag him down to get the check and takeout boxes) means 1 star.

Delicious. The fries were dull though but nothing salt and ketchup can't fix. Their ranch seemed to be too much? I'm not sure how to explain it but it was odd. The fried calamari was sooo good. Last time I tried grief calamari at a sushi place, I almost puked from how slimy it was but this one was perfect! It's so hard picking out a slice of cheesecake because all look so good! The Oreo is hard to finish completely because of the chocolate edge but it was delicious. Even though the server was really busy, she always dropped by to see how our meal was and made sure our drink cups were full! I love this place. I just think valentines day is the worst day to be here especially from how unorganized everyone is when you first walk in from how many people were there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=680
Elizabeth N.,"San Diego, CA",37,70,23,5.0,2/17/2014,"I am always satisfied with the customer service whenever I eat here. Most recently, my sister and I have been having these huge Cheesecake Factory cravings. So after work, we decided to go there. By the time we got there, it was already 11, and they close at 12. They welcomed us with open arms despite the time. We asked to be seated outside since we love their landscaping. Our waitress was very nice, attentive, and patient. We ordered: - Calamari appetizer (So good with lemon squeezed on top!! I like how the batter can be easily removed since I'm not a batter type of person. Great portion) - Shrimp scampi (Very good, next time we'll order with sauce on the side since it was saturated in it) - Chicken maderia (I think that's how it's spelled. We chose that since it was a popular pick. We didn't really like it as much as we wanted to. It was just chicken, nothing special.) - Godiva cake (Very good! I took two bites and I was full. It's really heavy. But so smooth, and delicious) I also order other items but at different locations. At the Cheesecake in Irvine Spectrum, my boyfriend and I ordered: - Chicken potstickers (So bomb, but ask for sauce on the side since the sauce is salty) - Cajun jumbalayan pasta (SO GOOD, OMG. Just thinking about it makes me crave it) - BBQ Salmon (It was recommended by our server but it was salmon with BBQ sauce on it.

Adam A.,"Pāhoa, HI",1,30,42,2.0,11/12/2013,Usually the Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. I didn't enjoy this one very much.  I was in town for a bit and came in. I had the fish and chips.

They have a pretty extensive menu but I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with fries. I was actually kind of dissapointed. The bread was good, the cheese was good, the steak was good, but it was just so greasy! The fries were pretty good. Nice and crispy. Not particularly greasy, but they are fried in oil so it didn't help the sandwich taste any better. I had the leftovers again the next day and it still didn't taste any better. I do like the free bread and butter the give you before the meal comes. It comes out nice and warm and the rye bread was the best! The sourdough was good too. Overall, I didn't like this particular meal, but we didn't have to wait to get seated and the service was okay. Maybe it's because I didn't get the cheese cake?

Kap K.,"La Jolla, CA",9,19,2,1.0,5/24/2013,"Well after a long day of running around town doing errands, we found ourselves at fashion valley hungry and tired. We were not dressed to impress, maybe that is we weren't served but nonetheless we decided to go grab something decent to eat and decided on Cheesecake Factory.  We have visited other ones across the country but never this location.   It seemed similar to other locations, busy, lines, etc... We went in grabbed a buzzer and waited 15mins the buzzer went off.  Nothing unusual we were expecting to wait.  We were seated outside and that is when the real waiting began.  The hostess sat us down and said our server will be right with us, we are patient people so the first 20mins we sat quietly and patiently. After seeing other people who were sat after us get their food orders in we began to get a little irritated.  But we still remained calm even trying to get the attention of a couple serves who passed our table to no avail.  Mind you that we still did not get a glass of water nor our food orders taken.  We finally gave up 45mins in because we were sitting there being passed by servers, food runners, and other employees, etc.  All of them just looked at us and kept going.   Im not sure if it was the way we were dressed, think relaxed or gym shorts tee shirt.  But we were totally ignored.  We left and we will never come back.  There was no excuse to have us wait that long just to be acknowledged.  Maybe our skin was too dark, maybe we looked like we don't have money, maybe we were too young looking to tip well, whatever the case may be, Cheesecake Factory in San Diego you disappointed us to the point that I tell this story to everyone and anyone I come into contact with.  Not the experience I was expecting when other locations have done so well, very disappointed and let employees know of this when we left and not even an apology.  I'm not the type to make a scene or call for the manager but maybe I should be to get some kind of response from you all.   If you skip this location, you are not missing out. We had dinner somewhere else that night and it was great and the food was awesome, oh and they treated us like we were human beings and acknowledge our presence.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=680

Anna L.,"San Diego, CA",192,158,5,3.0,12/11/2013,"I should preface this by saying: we are not Cheesecake Factory people.  My boyfriend received $45 worth of gift cards as a stocking stuffer at his work.  Having no other plans for the evening, we headed down to Fashion Valley (despite my concerns about the mall holiday crowd.) As it turned out, the wait was less than 10 minutes, which was a first for any of my prior experiences at this location. Our server was Robin, and she had a very full section as we arrived. How busy she was did not stop her from kindly greeting us and offering drinks. My boyfriend pointed out that the table had some crumbs, which our server sent a busboy to take care of speedily, even replacing his silverware. I scanned the menu for things that looked tasty, finally landing on the Chicken Madeira.  Every ingredient is one that I favor, including perfectly crunchy asparagus, marinated mushrooms, melted mozzarella, and a rich wine and peppercorn gravy atop the chicken, with a heaping side of mashed potatoes. My bf went for the Chicken and Biscuits, which was lightly seasoned sliced chicken, beside mashed potatoes, a mixture of mushrooms, carrots, peas, and onions, topped with a splash of gravy and a fluffy biscuit.  He wasn't crazy about much, other than the biscuit, so i gave him half of my chicken.   After dinner, since we were using gift cards, we checked out the cheesecake menu.  Bf was set on the key lime cheesecake, where I was leaning more toward the pumpkin pecan, so we got both, in addition to two coffees.  Robin, actually, was really excited that I was trying the pumpkin pecan, and noted that once it ran out, there would be no more until next October.  I gotta tell ya, it was pretty terrific.  I'm not that big on desserts, but pecan pie is a weakness.  The combo of pumpkin cheesecake and pecan pie were... a seriously holy matrimony.  So delicious.  Unable to finish the gargantuan slices, we packed the remaining dessert to go, as the server dropped our check. Our server, Robin, was  so on top of everything.  We never wanted for water, a friendly (but not over-attentive) check-in, or a smile.  She seriously rocked the house, and I would absolutely love to have her as as server again (I even got the bf to leave her a bigger tip than he had originally intended- not because he wasn't happy, but that he's not in the service industry, and I'm still trying to train him how to leave a proper gratuity.)  Completely unrelated to our service (which was, again, outstanding) my boyfriend was up all night, with stomach cramps from his food.  He's not that sensitive, so something had to have been off.  I, however, was fine... so that brings it down to the Chicken and Biscuits as the culprit.  That, unfortunately, is why this is 3 stars.  I don't expect much from chain restaurants, usually, but I at least expect myself or my dining companions to return home in good health.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=680
Derek H.,"Imperial, MO",50,164,4,3.0,7/10/2013,"So, my wife and I were trying to avoid chains while on our vacation, but we wanted to do some shopping and ended up at the nearby Fashion Valley Mall.  This is a huge outdoor mall, with just about every store you can imagine inside.  As with most malls, there weren't many dining options other than chains, and my wife and I were hungry so we settled on The Cheesecake Factory. The restaurant was fairly crowded, considering it was lunchtime on a Monday afternoon.  We were greeted by two servers, one trainee and a trainer.  My wife and I both ordered sandwiches, I opted for the club, while I believe my wife ordered a type of chicken sandwich.  The sandwiches were fine.  Nothing spectacular, but they were fine.  About what your would expect at the Cheesecake Factory.  It was way more food than both of us could eat.  Dessert looked great, and there are obviously a ton of choices, but we just didn't have room for it.  Maybe we should come here just for dessert sometime.  I think I might like that better.  :) Overall, our lunch was fine.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you're at the mall it's a convenient place to eat.  Unless of course you'd prefer the food court type of options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=680

Three visits ago I came with two dining companions and our order took 45 minutes  to come out from the time we ordered.  Two visits ago the waitress spilled my dinner all over our table (I get it I'm a klutz too, shizza happens), but my replacement didn't come until my dining companion had finished eating. Lame.  Yesterday we ordered a simple app that took 20 minutes to get out to us. Then they screwed up my dinner (I asked for a veggie patty and they gave me meat, they did realize before sending it out though). We waited another 30 minutes for that to be remade. I'm pretty sure My Dining companions pasta had sat under the warming light while the remade my order because some of the noodles were rock hard. And as a waiter dropped off our food he mentioned there was blue plastic from one of those frilled toothpicks IN HIS PASTA. Lovely.

I've been going to this place every now and then for years. I always have trouble deciding what to order because there are so many things I'd like to try. The Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes are great as an appetizer. I prefer to share that with a friend in order to leave room for other items. I also enjoy the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich - a full meal by itself. And, of course, the variety of cheesecakes is amazing. I like getting a slice and then try not to think about the caloric content so I can savor it without much guilt. Once in a while it's ok to just let go, especially when the treat is worthwhile.   The place is a bit noisy and invariably there's been a long wait - of at least 20 minutes - every time I've gone there. So, patience is needed.

The menu is quite large and caters to many different tastes, whether you want pizza, seafood, pasta, or even steak. The dessert/chesecake menu is just as varied as the main options, which is always a good thing. However, quality does come with a price; be prepared to spend a little bit of money if you go the appetizer, main course, dessert route.

Vi N.,"San Diego, CA",128,9,5,1.0,3/17/2013,"Someone please enlighten me because I  can not understand how this place manages to have 3.5 stars. You're paying Benecotto/Cucina Urbana prices (both 4+ stars on yelp) for Olive Garden (and possibly even Chef Boyardee) quality food. Hell, you can go to Cucina Charisma in Hillcrest (4.5stars) and pay a fraction of the price. I JUST DON'T GET IT! I mean, I know this is the Cheesecake Factory, and that it's a chain, but I do expect some minimal level of edibility.  I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (with grilled chicken instead of breaded) to go via curb side pick up. This review will deconstruct the dish and elaborate on everything thing wrong with it and possibly this establishment in general.  First, the chicken was burnt. No, I apologize, it wasn't merely burnt, it was BUUURRRRNNNTTT.  As such, the chicken breast bore more semblance to burnt hamburger patties than it did to chicken. Also, usually when one properly cooks chicken, you let it rest before tampering with, so to ensure that the flavor doesn't drain from the meat. I don't think the cooks adhered to this. Instead, I believed they butchered that chicken breast immediate, without giving it the chance to sit. I mean, this is something so elementary that a chef (or amateur home cook) should know about.  Consequently, the meat itself was dry. Furthermore, the dry and nasty-ness of the chicken breast was exacerbated by the fact that the burnt outside gave the breast a gritty, bitter taste. Second, the pasta was bland. I've recreated a similar dish at home, so I know the potential it has. Anyway, back to the blandness. As a ""southern"" dish, I was expecting more bold flavors - you know, some thyme, cumin, paprika, cayenne, parsley, all that good stuff. Instead, what I got was bowtie pasta with minimal butter and maybe some cream. In order to salvage the dish, I decided to salt and pepper the life out of the dish, but to no avail. It's likely that all the salt they used to de-ice DC after the snowstorm would not have been sufficient to salvage this dish.  Third, there was no red or yellow bell peppers as the menu suggested. I'm sure the addition of such ingredients would have helped with the blandness problem.  Fourth, doesn't anyway find their menu tacky. Why are there advertisements?  Anyway, needless to say, after two bites (one of the chicken and one of the pasta), I threw it away. What a waste of $20 dollars ($18 for the dish and $2 tip I gave to the curb side pick up girl)!   The management really needs to more closely inspect the quality of food they are serving. Basic skills are obviously lacking (i.e., taste the food you're putting out to see if it's properly season, look at the protein to see if it actually resembles what you're trying to serve, etc.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=680

We both ordered a drink ($13 each for a tiny martini!) and I got the Crusted Chicken Romano, she ordered the Pasta Carbonara, both off the lunch menu which has smaller portions. Both were VERY bland and lukewarm... I would rather have had the grilled cheese we ordered for my nephew off the kids menu. We both had just a couple bites of our meal and let them take our almost full plates away. The Fried Macaroni & Cheese was delicious and filled with steaming hot gooey cheese... yummy!!

Willy W.,"Culver City, CA",124,683,914,4.0,12/28/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is probably my favorite chain restaurant. That being said, I don't go too often for a few reasons. Namely:  1) they don't take reservations 2) that means a pretty long wait regardless of party size 3) the prices are a little higher than most places 4) it's often like zoo inside because it is so wildly popular 5) most of their food is very rich - ie fatty BUT in turn, their food is very tasty and they serve some outstanding (IMHO) cheesecakes. Stopped by this particular location because it was awfully nearby the infamous Hotel Circle. However, it's located by a mall which makes it even more crowded. So we waited around 35 minutes for a table for 6. I suppose that isn't too bad because it definitely could have been worse. Everyone enjoyed their food and we all shared two cheesecakes for dessert: the ""tiramisu"" and ""chocolate raspberry truffle"". Both were good, but the latter was the standout that night. It was very rich and the raspberry flavor was noticeable but not overpowering. The tiramisu one was a little too soggy for my taste. It was basically a tiramisu with a small layer of cheesecake dumped on top. I probably wouldn't order that one again.

I had the Cajun jambalaya chicken and shrimp pasta and holy poop! This was sooooo good. The shrimp was so fresh and the chicken literally melted in my mouth it was so moist and delicious! I don't usually like chicken in my pasta but this was out of this world! My boyfriend had a bacon bacon burger, which he teared up (haha) because it was the best burger he ever had. He said there was plenty of bacon and it was cooked beautifully, he also said the cheese was melted just right and the meat had a little pink which was juicy. The cheesecakes is so delicious!!!

My waiter was very attentive and would always check up on us. He deserved the tip we gave him. He would pack my leftovers away and made sure our cheesecakes that we had to go was nicely put away.

I can't believe it has been so long since I last ate at this restaurant. I was served by a waiter named William B. He was okay overall and I never had a problem with his service. They give you free bread before you order your meal. The bread wasn't as soft or as warm as I would have liked but it still tasted alright. Their menu is like a book. So many options that I didn't know what I wanted. I eventually settled for the Pasta Da Vinci  . It was pretty good and portion was huge. I manage to finish it and then of course I had to get the cheesecakes for dessert. This is where the minus one star comes in. The prices of one slice of cheesecake is too high. One slice alone costs $8.00. Granted they are delicious, especially the Oreo Cheesecake that I had but still, at that price the slices should have been a lot larger. I'm pretty sure that I could buy a whole cheesecake pie at a local bakery for only maybe $10.00 max. Sometimes it is better to sacrifice quality over quantity if you're on a tight budget, but if you want to splurge in a finer upscale environment without any concerns on the quality, then check this restaurant out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=660
Jennifer V.,"San Diego, CA",126,152,152,4.0,3/30/2015,"I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, except when the wait is so long, you have to choose another restaurant to eat at. Most of the time, my family and I just wait for a table in the bar because it tends to be quicker than waiting for a table in the dining areas. Besides that, the service is always pretty consistent and the food never seems to take too long to come out. Luckily, they offer delicious bread to snack on while you wait for what you ordered. Some of my favorite items are the Skinnylicious Veggie Burger, Grilled Turkey Burger, Chinese Chicken Salad, and most recently, the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich. Honestly, I'm not a big cheesecake person, but the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake is a great choice. I recommend splitting it with someone due to how rich it is though! It's nice that there are so many different options but, it's always a challenge deciding on what to order! Their Skinnylicious menu is the best because it allows me to indulge a little without overeating. They also have a tasty breakfast menu that I never tired in all the years I've come here until lately. For Sunday Brunch, the Eggs Benedict is my go to. On the daily breakfast menu, I really enjoyed the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich (scrambled egg, smoked bacon, ham, grilled tomato, melted cheddar cheese and mayonnaise on grilled brioche bread) that I tried for the first time about a week ago. The potatoes were actually really good too because they were mixed with sautéed onions. The meal was so filling, I had to take half of it home. I'm definitely going to come here for breakfast again soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=660

There are so many choices and everything sounds so good that the most challenging part of visiting is choosing what to eat. I narrowed my lunch selection to the club sandwich or herb-crusted salmon and after much debate, opted for the fish. And boy was it good! The salmon was moist and tender and the mashed potatoes were wonderful. I especially loved the sauce that ringed the plate and perfectly complemented both the salmon and potatoes.  The waiter cracked me up when I asked for extra potatoes in place of the asparagus and he called me a ""reverse vegetarian."" Yep, that's right, no veggies for me! Despite the restaurant being packed, we only waited 10 minutes for a table and our food arrived quickly. One other quick tip, try to eat outside on the patio on a nice, warm day.

The Fashion Valley Mall is not well known for having ample, easy parking. Tonight was no different. Traffic galore with minimal spaces available...it's not Christmas shopping time -is it? The wait to get seated was just about an hour. Not sure this is normal for a Friday night (7:30pm), but there were lots of prom night couples. Now onto the food: My wife had the ""Three Taco"" Skinnylicious dinner. She found the tacos to be excellent but the sauce was a bit too spicy for her tastes...kinda buffalo-ish. I had the meatloaf dinner. It was served less than hot (but good for me as I like it that way). It was quite flavorful and well enjoyed.  Both meals had good portions and we now know why everyone was walking out with ""doggy bags"". Service: Our waiter was named Daniel.

Service was good in the meantime and during the meal. The food was not what I expected after this much anticipation. My relatives weren't particularly impressed with their pasta, my aunt's linguine was stuck together in a bundle, and my burger that was recommended by the server was very average. First place I've ever been to where the fries had more flavor than the onion rings.

But I really wanted to try this place out, so we stayed. We decided to check out the bar to get a drink and maybe an appetizer while we waited, and instead of doing that, we were approached by a waiter passing by. He asked if we were there for dinner, and then he seated us right in front of the bar at a high table - not a great spot if you're with a large group or kids, but perfect for just 2 - and the rest of the experience was excellent! Pros: Great food and drinks. We had the passionfruit mojito and whiskey sour, both yummy. Our waiter was very funny and helpful in our indecision for ordering. BF and I both got chicken dishes which were great in portions, with delicious mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. We had to take a breather for ordering cheesecake, but when it did come, BF's Oreo and my Kahlua slices were perfection.

I love the atmosphere of this place and although the seating can be a little cramped I'm ok with it.  MY FAVE: Mexican Tortilla Chicken Salad... SKINNYLICIOUS w/ some cilantro puree to with it. I can eat this every day!!! I recommend getting the crab bites... small or big... because they are delicious as well.  Since I have been on my healthier kick I stick to the salad... although one day I am going to break out of that stage and dig right in. I would also recommend:  The Bellagio Chicken Marsala Asian Chicken Salad (no the chopped) SKINNYLICIOUS BUFFALO BLASTS Avacado Egg Rolls I really love it here!!

This is usually my first choice to come for birthday celebrations, and I always leave WAY too full. My favorite dish is the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. I don't care for fettuccini, but they always let me replace angel hair pasta instead. Nom nom nom!  My fiancé loves the jambalaya and always leaves with a stomach ache (he tries to not eat it all but he can't help himself).  The smartest thing you can do here is eat half your entree and save the other half for later (if you can). Then enjoy a piece of cheesecake. If you try to eat everything AND have dessert you will need to lay down for awhile. I took off one star only because they are always packed and the wait can sometimes be long. That and I have never gotten to sit in a booth (also because they are always busy). I usually end up at one of those little tables that are about a foot from the neighbors.

I'm talking pizza, omelets, salads, meat of all sorts, pasta, sammiches, everything. I got a salad with seared ahi on it. It was decent. I have had better in my day, but have had WAY worse for sure. My mother and sister split and omelet and gave it high reviews. I don't remember what my father got, but I'm sure it was either pulled pork or meatloaf. That's all he ever orders.  After eating carefully to not fill themselves up, everyone ordered their own cheesecake.

I was told there was a 30 minute wait. When we got there it was very packed. I thought maybe I heard the hostess wrong and maybe I miss heard her and it was an hour and half wait. Nope it was only about a 45 minute of a wait. When I signed us in I made sure to tell them that we were celebrating my sisters birthday.  Once seated we ordered drinks and appetizers. We ordered the wings and fried mac n cheese balls with marinara. My husband said the wings were spicy hot and very vinegary. The mac n cheese balls were very good, these are a definite must to try when you come here.  We then ordered 4 entrees, Orange Chicken, Chicken n Biscuits, Steak Diane. The servings were huge. The Chicken n Biscuits were not that great, it was served with a side of seasonal vegetables they were the highlight of my meal. The chicken was dry I ordered an extra side of gray just to add moisture to it. We then ordered 4 pieces of cheesecake all of which were delicious.  Now here is why I gave the 1 star. I made sure to tell them it was a birthday dinner when I arrived and checked in. My sister was here visiting for work so I made the 60 mile drive to where she was working to take her to a nice dinner for her birthday. When I checked in and told them this, they told me they would let the server know. After we ordered our drinks I caught up with our server to reiterate the fact that we were celebrating a birthday she gave the nod and was like okay.  After the completion of our meal our server comes to our table with a candle and a lighter and there the 5 of us are singing happy birthday so pathetically to my sister, mind you while all around us there were groups of servers singing lively to patrons Happy Birthday. I was beyond pissed. After paying $175.00 with tip on a dinner for 4. The server couldn't even gather 5 servers, busboys, hostesses or dishwashers to sing happy birthday.

Nancy T.,"Clairemont, San Diego, CA",3,12,7,4.0,3/19/2015,I go to Cheesecake Factory a lot and I actually really enjoy their food. They have a variety of food to choose from! I love how they organized their menu. Makes it much easier for you! I usually get their baja chicken tacos and it is sooo good! My boyfriend and friends loves the hibachi steak The reason why I'm giving it 4 out 5 because is I went to Cheesecake Factory last night with a friend and I got my usual baja chicken tacos and it did not taste the same at all. It was so bland. I was super disappointed. The  server politely told me that they changed the recipe because some people were complaining that it was too spicy..

Hopefully you guys will bump into him, such a wonderful waiter. taste: ordered bistro shrimp pasta for $16.95? --this is my fav dish here. because theres an excessive amount of shrimp and the taste is super savory!  portion: pretty big hence the priceyness. i usually take home about half the plate. the only down part of taking home the plate is the amount of oil you will see lying at the bottom of the box. yep, blood vessels clogged. we were seated after 40 mins. terrible wait on friday nights. DONT GO FRIDAY NIGHTS! and we were seated outside. the heat lamps work pretty well but i felt like my face was melting off.. also had the strawberry lemonade which tastes GREAT!

When I went, it was around 5pm, and our party (party of 5...hehe) was seated immediately.  Our server was very helpful in suggesting things and explaining different dishes. If you're coming here on a budget, try to go for the small plates. Choose 2 different things, and you'll be set. I got Greek salad, which was okay. I was expecting more salad greens on my plate, but it was mostly just tomatoes and cucumbers. I also got the Crab and Artichoke dip, which was actually really good! It was a perfect blend of flavors. It came with some sliced bread for dipping.

Clayton B.,"Oceanside, CA",138,297,63,1.0,7/7/2013,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factories and this was by far, hands down, the single worst one I've ever been to.  The wait wasn't too bad, it took my date and I about 10 minutes to get seated. Unfortunately, it was right next to the service station and hearing all the chatty servers gossiping and complaining was a bit annoying. The menu is huge and our server gave us quite a while to go through it and decide but he checked up on us once in 20 minutes to the point where I had to get up and walk to find the guy to come back to our table. It usually takes a little bit to get my food but I've never waited 50 minutes before... Then to make things worse, we told the guy we were going to watch a movie and wanted our check ASAP. He took his time and didn't get it to us for about 15 minutes. As he was taking our food away, he tilted the plate too far to the side and dumped red sauce all over my date's skirt... yyeeaaa, it was white and black. Was not very excited about that. Our bill was $38 but then we realize he gave us a check for another table that was $95. At this point we called the manager over and explained everything that was wrong about our experience. She fixed it on the spot and surprisingly didn't comp anything for such a bad experience. Needless to say, that guy got no tip and we will NOT be returning to this place again.

You quickly learn that even though the appetizers are delicious, and the main entrée can actually be finished in one sitting (not recommended), you should always save room for cheesecake. So, last night we shared an appetizer between 3 people, we ate only half of our entrees and were able to enjoy cheesecake. Now, we have  awesome leftovers for tomorrow  We had the avocado roll appetizers, I had the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus and finally my wife & I shared a Kahlua Cocoa, coffee cheesecake.

Rachel E.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",83,49,9,2.0,2/11/2013,"We went to The Cheesecake Factory on Sunday because we had a $50 gift card.  We've been here before several times, but probably wouldn't have gone back if it wasn't for the gift card. PROS:  The cheesecake is good, and apparently they make a really good burger. The service is decent and helpful. CONS:  Parking at Fashion Valley for a Sunday Lunch is a PAIN.   There is a lot of waiting in order to get to the table part of the experience.   There are TONS of people.  Don't go if you don't like crowds. The décor is something I try not to look at. If you're an indecisive person, it will take you 20 minutes to decide what to get off their extensive menu. The drinks are overpriced. ---------------------------------------------- ENVIRONMENT & SERVICE: It's a chore to get into Cheesecake Factory for lunch on the weekend.  It was just 2 of us, so our wait was about 20 minutes.  We scored bar seats, and could have ordered our food right there, but decided to get a drink and wait for a table.  Our total was $17 and some change (not including tip), which I think is steep for the cheapest glass of pinot noir on the menu and a Stone IPA.  We knew from prior experience not to waste our time with the mixed drinks - it's a minimum $10 per drink and always a stingy pour. You know that feeling when you've been waiting for a table, and you're hungry, and you're a bit miffed because you just put down a $20 bill for a beer & a glass of wine, and then that little indicator starts lighting up and you know it's your turn to sit down?  It's an exciting feeling, even for a little thing like that.  But at The Cheesecake Factory, there's no Sarah or Alison or Jennifer to greet you with a smile as you walk back to the foyer, saying ""right this way!""   Instead, there's a hostess fortress where they take your buzzer back, saying ""please wait over here for your name to be called.""  Wait a second, isn't that what I just did? Isn't that what the buzzer means?!?  Nope.  Not at the Cheesecake Factory.  I was just extracted from my comfy seat at the bar, and placed into the ""elite"" waiting pool, where I spent another 5 minutes crammed against the side of the wall, trying to stay out of the way of the servers running between the kitchen and the cheesecake counter, and suspiciously eyeing those around me to see who will make the second cut. Our server, thankfully, was attentive but not overbearing, not memorable but efficient, which is sometimes just what you want.  He recommended the burger, which was a good call, and boxed our leftovers up quickly, and didn't mind when we just sat for a little while trying to digest the mess in our stomachs after we paid. THE FOOD: There's bread to start (the brown squaw bread is great!), but with cold butter patties, which is always something that peeves Shawn Michael.  You can't spread cold butter.  I know this place is a ""factory"" of food, so they have to keep their butter cold during storage, and there's such a huge turnover of guests that it's likely unfeasible to thaw butter in accurate quantities to a spreadable consistency... but we both wish someone would try to figure it out.   We got the Buffalo Blasts- in all their creamy, savory, crispy glory.  This is what you think when you first bite into one, and by the second, you're thinking about how many calories are packed into one of the deep-fried pockets of gooey goodness.  Perhaps more frightening than the near-300 calories for each Blast is that each one is also loaded with over 1,000 mg of sodium... and we hadn't even arrived at the main course. Shawn Michael had the Smokehouse BBQ Burger, and I had the Monte Cristo Sandwich.  The Monte Cristo was just OK... The bread could have been crispier, and I hate it when all the insides are piled in the center of the sandwich- I shouldn't have to re-distribute the contents in order to have more than one good bite out of each sandwich wedge.  Shawn said his burger was REALLY good.  It made it to his top 10 list of San Diego Burgers, so that's saying something. And we had the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake-this velvety, creamy, melt-in-your-mouth dessert does not disappoint.  We had it at our wedding, so that's saying something! CONCLUSION Even while I enjoyed (for the most part) my indulgent food episode, while I was savoring my last bite I said with a smile, ""Can we please never come here again?""  Perhaps it's the thousands of calories I ingest effortlessly, or the crowds and overpriced drinks... but it makes me feel a bit like I'm waiting in line for a fried Oreo at the fair. Now that I think of it, my reaction to the Cheesecake Factory is strikingly similar to my reaction to the San Diego County Fair.  However, I shouldn't think ""fair"" when I go to a restaurant. I guess the upside is that my experience has satisfied that bit of cultural longing; I might just skip the trip to Del Mar this June!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=720
Kate G.,"Davenport, FL",111,305,123,4.0,6/23/2011,"A good friend and I came to the Cheesecake Factory last night to have a snack and a piece of cheesecake and drinks before going out.  The wait for a table was 45 minutes, so we opted to sit at the bar instead.  So this review is for the bar. The service at the bar was fabulous!  It was kept clean, and we were constantly being attended to.  I had an insanely delicious chocolate banana drink and my friend had the tropical martini.  Both drinks were amazing!  Very sweet and not mediciney, like a lot of alcoholic drinks tend to be.  We also ordered fries and those were brought out pretty quickly, and they were hot, just off the fryer.. they definitely hadn't been sitting too long.  The bartenders were great.  They constantly were coming up to us to ask if we needed anything, and they also kept our waters completely full.  We finished off the evening with cheesecake!  I went with the original, and it was delicious as always.  I know it's a chain, but the Cheesecake Factory really does have some incredible cheesecake.  The selection is huge, and all of it is really good. The only reason that I'm giving the Cheesecake Factory a 4 instead of a 5 is because the wait is just absolutely insane no matter what time you get there.. and while sitting at the bar was a fun experience, I would have preferred sitting at a booth.  We may have even ordered full meals in that case.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=720

My husband and I decided to go for Valentine's Day because who doesn't love a big slice of cheesecake on Valentine's Day?! But I will say the wait sucked, I think every couple in San Diego was there as to be expected on this holiday. After about an hour (yes, an hour. But when I say it was packed I mean it was PACKED)  our buzzer went off we were seated right away! We had to wait a little bit for our food to be expected when they are cooking for so many people, and our waiter was very polite and offered many apologies for our wait as well as the manager coming to our table to apologize and offer and appetizer, more bread, etc. We kindly declined anticipating our food! The food is pricy, but well worth it. We both left satisfied with left overs and yummy cheesecake in hand!

Aiza L.,"San Diego, CA",1,14,9,4.0,3/2/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite places to eat at period. I like how they have SO many food and dessert options to choose from. The food is usually prepared very well and their portions are large enough that you can usually share your food with someone else. I often get the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and for dessert the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. I've had a bunch of their other cheesecakes but that one is probably my favorite. I also recommend the hershey's chocolate bar, red velvet, 30th anniversary, and the regular strawberry cheesecakes. But basically, all the cheesecakes I've tried so far have yet to disappoint. THEY'RE ALL SO GOOD. This place doesn't take reservations so if you come with a large party it's best to put your name down at LEAST 45 minutes ahead (especially since the place can get SUPER busy during peak hours). It's right next to the mall so there' s no problem with wondering what you'll do to pass the time.

Alexander Y.,"Rowland Heights, CA",507,723,1547,4.0,11/10/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is what it is:  it's a chain restaurant that's overpriced for more or less mediocre food, but it has really damn good cheesecake.  And honestly, that's probably why I keep coming back, because very few places have the insane variety of ridiculously awesome cheesecake that they do.  If you accept that before you come here, then you'll enjoy your time here. That said, I hadn't actually been to the Mission Valley store, so I figured I'd give it a go to celebrate my friend's new job.  Already busy on a Wednesday night at 6 PM, but we were able to be seated outside with heated lamps in about 5 minutes. Normally I don't care much for decor since 90% of the rating I give to a review is based on the food.  But since I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing, I gotta say this particular store is designed with quite a bit of class.  If I hadn't been more concerned about sitting down faster because I was ridiculously hungry, I would've enjoyed sitting inside. Ended up choosing the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, which was pretty good.  Also had the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake (wanted to change it up from the undisputed best cheesecake they have, the White Raspberry Chocolate Truffle)...and I remembered why I bothered to still come here.

Every person who helped us from the server to the bussing and other wait staff was really on the ball and nice. The menu is pages and pages long.

We were never rushed and when two other friends joined us at the end of the meal, they graciously provided extra forks for sharing our desserts family-style.

Note that we've made reservations in advance. But hey, I'll be understanding and excuse that. The prices here are definitely a bit higher than other restaraunts I've been to that offer the same dishes. I ordered Thai Chicken Pasta and my boyfriend ordered some salmon and shrimp dish along with a beer. Our total came out to more than $50, not including gratuity. The food was decent but definitely not burning my wallet for, though the portions were a good size.

The ""Macaroni and Cheese Burger"" was not as good as I thought it would be. I kinda figured! I picked it for the novelty but there's just so much going on in your mouth that you don't really distinguish the mac n' cheese flavor on its own that much. Just tastes like a really heavy burger. I would rather get a side of mac n' cheese, and just get a regular burger next time. :) Tried the ""Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake"" for dessert. I liked how they had actual candy bits in it. Worth getting if you can share with your group.

But recently I was craving cheesecake so we decided to go for it. Overall, it was pretty good. We only had to wait about 20 minutes for a party of two and the service was shockingly good. Our waiter was one of the best and most attentive waiters I've had in a long time. I also love that the menu is so huge. There's literally any kind of food you could want to eat.  The food was tasty, with big portions, and of course the cheesecake was heavenly. However, my boyfriend didn't love that the cobb salad (while gigantic and overall good) was all shredded lettuce instead of actual leaves. It was just a step up from the lettuce you would get at Subway. I guess they try to make it bite sized so you can eat it faster? :) I would come back, but it's not someplace I'm just dying to go back to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=800

Everybody knows about their ginormous menu and equally ginormous portions, so I won't rehash that. I will say that I always order either the Navajo sandwich or the Cuban sandwich, and I honestly can't decide which one I love better. Oh, and they have the best cheesecake...it's so freaking good.

I ordered the curry chicken samosas and the Boston House Salad. He ordered a Ceasar Salad. We both ordered the ""small"" sizes which were actually pretty huge. The food was sooo good and flavorful.

We didn't say anything we just pushed it aside and used another one. We had to ask twice before getting lemons for our water. When I got my steak it was burnt and over cooked. The worst part was the waitress continued to argue the steak was not over cooked nor burned. She refused to take my plate back by making all sorts of excuses. I don't think it's a waitress' position to make that decision. She should've taken it back or had a manager come out and look at it. Her attitude was very unprofessional! After she left, she came back and said if I wanted they would remake the steak but this time cut it in half and then cook it. I didn't like the idea and at that point I no longer felt comfortable sending back my plate with her. It seemed like if she was taking my plate back it was coming with a little something on it.

The cheesecake..  Sometimes I just drive down to fashion valley just to get some cheesecake to go.  Crazy.  yes.  normal for me.  yes.  I used to always get the tiramisu cheesecake.  Gives me the chocolate craving i want but it isn't too much chocolate.  The tiramisu cake is actually better than the cheesecake.  If you love tiramisu just as much as I do then get the cake over the cheesecake.  Banana creme cheesecake is really good also.  I just recently had my new favorite a few months a go and I have driven down there many times to have it again.  the pineapple upside down cheesecake.  it is delicious!  yum!   The service.  Fail.  From my experience with large parties, never come here with a lot of people.  If you do, expect to wait 2 hours.  Happened to me twice with the large parties i was in.  They won't actually give you a buzzer unless most of your people are there.  One time I waited in their lobby for a good hour for my take-out.  I ordered my take-out with my friend at the same time.  Hers was finished when they told us to come back but mine wasn't ready yet.  So I patiently waited then I got mad.  I had to complain and I had to wait for a manager... more waiting.   It was stupid they put back my order.  He offered my next meal free but I didn't know the next time i'd be down since I live around 40 minutes away.  He ended up refunding my cheesecakes which was nice of him.  It is hit or miss with the service so be prepared.

Last night we went for a friends birthday I am so disappointed cause I have never gotten such bad waiter before in my life. First off she takes our drink orders she got two of them wrong. We asked for bread when she ordered our drinks and when the drinks arrived there was no bread. We had to ask her a few more times until she finally brought the bread out. Eventually our food arrives she can't remember what we ordered and put the wrong plates down in front of us. When she starts switching the plates she spilled one of our drinks. My friend never got a new one and she didn't even apologize. The food was delicious we were having a good time. She asked us if she wanted to split the checks we said yes but she walked away while we were telling her how to split them. One of my friends volunteered to cover my friends since it was her birthday. She came back with the checks my friend asked for the check that was my friends and the waitress responded with such attitude saying ""you didn't order that"" than after my friend said she was covering hers she threw both of the checks down in front of her and walked away. We also had to reminder her five times it was our friends birthday and if she could bring out the sundae. She wouldn't pick up the checks even though we kept saying excuse me whenever she walked by. Eventually we got up to walk to the front to see if someone could ring us up she stopped us than gave major attitude again. I don't think I will ever return to this Cheesecake Factory location again.

Initially, this dish confused me, as it resembled something that I grew up eating: fresh, steamed fish. There were two corn husks poking out from either end (hence the resemblance to fish fins). The cakes were topped with sour cream, avocado, salsa, and salsa verde. It was delicious in a shameful way. The cakes were sweet and moist and the toppings were fun to eat.  The firecracker salmon rolls were basically egg rolls. I was glad to see that the salmon was slightly undercooked. It was a good dish, but I liked the tamale cakes more.

Anywho picking up this cheese cake was very difficult. Adults and children alike were all over the place. One employee was standing there like they were completly lost in the madness.  I live in San Diego and we all know to avoid the mall area on the weekends if you want to keep your cool. I on the other hand have not been to the mall in a very long time so I had a major brain fart and took the fam to the mall with the tourists FML at the moment.  So the restuarant was packed to the max bad a** kids running around, a few of them shoved me while I was in line to get a cake. I am a mother now but I have not always been one. I use to be and still am that person who looks around wondering where these kids parents are. On that note my children behave all the time because they know what's up if the act a fool.  I dont know what this resturant looks like on a weekday but. Am willing to take a chance and find out. I give this resturant a 4 star rating for the Yummy cakes and the smell of the food that I can not wait try. Then there is the employees, who seemed very well composed and kind with all the madness except for that one; I don't think I will see him next time. I didn't like that the didn't take control of their waiting area, I tell you It was awful in there.

We decided to share our grub and started off with calamari, the endive salad and lastly,  the chicken madeira with asparagus dish between the three of us. Of course we ordered some cocktails while we waited for our grub.  The specialty drink selection looked great, but I was in the mood for some Pinot.  The girls enjoyed their Asian Pear martinis and mojitos. =) Service was great, the food was scrumptious and the strawberry shortcake dessert we ended our dining experience with was fabulous.  Although the place was getting really busy with the dinner crowd, not once did we feel rushed to get out of there; we must've been sitting there for a good two hours not realizing what time it was...it's been a while since I've seen my girls! This place is normally crowded and the wait time for a table can be a pain, but if you're willing to wait it out or if you're old enough to find an open seat in the bar area (with no kids in tow), go for it!   The only things I need to knock them on is the bread coming out cold (it's normally served warm) and their super slippery floors.  Ladies, be careful if you're wearing heels, you can easily eat sh-t if you're not paying attention to the slippin' and slidin' with their shiny flooring.  Oh yeah, the restroom was also in need of some maintenance, but that was just an observation that didn't ruin my time here since I have yet to have a really bad experience dining at any Cheesecake Factory location. =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=740

I wish I could give her credit but I didn't catch her name. My wife and I took our moms here for Mother's Day. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken, not too spicy and my wife ordered the Fish and Chips. We both enjoyed our food on Sunday as well as the next day at lunch. we also had the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake which was ridiculously good. The prices are a little high, but its Fashion Valley and for that area I would say they are just right, especially for the portion size. They do not go light!! Even their bread that they send out with each meal is fresh, warm and moist. Have been here several times amongst the years and will continue to go back. I recommend putting your name in early, go shopping for a while and then coming back to eat. Again if there was one hindrance at all, that be it.

Leonard L.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",685,1396,3857,3.0,12/23/2009,"Every time I go to cheesecake factory, I am always amazed by how a restaurant can act so much like a machine.  You provide the host/hostess your name and party number and they give you a wait time and a buzzer thingy.  Then you wait until the buzzer vibrates and you turn in the buzzer thing and wait in line for someone to seat you.  Someone directs you somewhere in the labyrinthine of seating. The waiter takes your drink order.  The bar-back brings you that drink.  The waiter takes your appetizer and/or entrée order.  The food runner brings you your food.  The waiter takes your dessert and actually brings you your dessert and the check.  By this time, you have you have finished a 20 dollar meal in less than an hour (depending on the wait time). The only reason I go to the hell that is cheesecake factory is that I get cravings for the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad which somehow I always call it a buffalo ranch chicken salad by mistake.  The barbeque ranch chicken salad contains 959 calories with 4 grams of fat and 874 milligrams of sodium, which is why it is delicious.

Note the small plate menu. The grilled shishito peppers were terrific: barely blistered, a little spicy, and lightly dusted with sea salt. Just as good as the ones we had a couple months ago in downtown LA at Lazy Ox Canteen.  The arugula salad was fresh and spicy; the vinaigrette dressing was perfect. With the shaved parmesan and raisins, it wasn't terribly avant-garde, but it was most certainly above par given the predominance of otherwise fried and processed food.  Vietnamese tacos - three to an order - were interesting. It consisted of pork on a soft bun shaped like a tortilla and some strips of carrot-based slaw. The lettuce wrap appetizer was enough for two other people at our table to make an entire meal of.  One of those mall restaurants where you are bound to end up one day, even if against your will.

I don't mind taking it out, but I'd rather not waste food like that. The third time I went I got their fettucini alfredo with chicken. Not a whole lot of chicken, like a few pieces and the noodle tasted like it wasn't fully cooked? The noodles weren't soft, they were a little hard. The sauce was really rich though.

Jessie F.,"San Diego, CA",15,5,,1.0,6/2/2012,"This was my third and final attempt to enjoy a cheesecake factory restaurant.  It was unsuccessful. Where to begin.  Let's start with the location.  At an overcrowded mall, the restaurant feels more like an auction house than a restaurant.  The place isn't really designed to handle nearly as many people as they seem to have on a regular basis.  As a result our party of 8 (6 adults 2 children)  was forced to stand for an hour while we awaited a table.  They do not take reservations, which we had tried to secure earlier in the day, even for large parties.  They also required managerial approval in order to combine two tables to make room for our party, which meant even getting in line took over 5 minutes.  To call this place crowded is an understatement, and to call them prepared for the amount of patrons would be a bold faced lie. So after our long wait, we were called to the front desk which had people packed around it as if it were a mosh pit, it took another 5 minutes to be seated by the hostess who wasn't quite ready for us apparently, and when we were finally seated it took another 5 minutes for our waiter to arrive and take our drink order.  Our drinks arrived without straws, which it seemed they had been rationing out to only about half of the patrons.  I ordered a Pomegranate Mojito just to tolerate the place at this point, luckily it came with a straw.  The Mojito was tolerable, it tasted watered down and was far from actually impressive, and I had no desire to order another.   Fifteen minutes later our waitress finally returned to take our order, which I'd decided on over 10 minutes earlier.  I've eaten here twice before and on both occasions I tried their seafood and wound up having food poisoning shortly thereafter, so I decided to play it safe and try to order something which I could imagine they actually couldn't screw up.  I went with a Hawaiian pizza, which has ham, pineapple, and red onions on it (literally the only ingredients) and when I ordered it the waitress informed me that it had red onions on it, just in case I wasn't capable of reading the three ingredients in the item I ordered. after another 25 minutes or so, our food began arriving in pieces, and I do mean in pieces... salad dressing for a salad here, a grilled cheese sandwich there.  When my food did arrive most of the glasses at the table were empty, and the only one which I was offered to have refilled was the Mojito, I had to request the other.  My food was serviceable, but unimpressive.  The pasta's I've tried have had the same effect, and I really don't find anything special about their food at all, especially for the price they charge for it.  I can rattle off many great restaurants around SD that have far better food for far less, but I digress.  The verdict on the pizza:  Like everything I've seen here, it seemed designed for the fattest person imaginable, Almost no pineapple on the pizza, however it was smothered in ham, so much so that I wound up picking pieces of it off to ensure I could even taste the cheese.  After completing my meal I decided to bypass dessert, which I've had before (the cheesecakes are quite overrated, other than their enormous size there's nothing spectacular about them) and asked for my check.   I was informed that they would only split the check one time, which meant I had to remain at the table until after everyone at the table had finished ordering, which included dessert, which I found to be wildly lazy and unprofessional.  For the prices at this place, I should receive better service than what I could expect at a cheap diner.  I patiently waited for my check; however.   Everyone ordered their desserts and they all arrived before the waiter even returned to see how the bill would be split, instead of splitting it after taking their order, knowing I wished to leave. When i received my bill there was an %18 gratuity automatically added, which explained my outrageous service and why they could care less.  At no point during the meal did they ask about my meal or how the food was.  Other than delivering our items, or asking for the next course, I did not see our waitress at all.  And I was thoroughly disappointed with the restaurant AGAIN.  And finally my bill came to over $70 for food which I would expect to find in any drive in diner in the midwest. The cream of the trip; however, is that last night, once again, just like my previous 2 visits, I spent most of my evening sprinting from my bed to vomit with an upset stomach.  This was my last attempt at tolerating the Cheesecake Factory and I will not be returning.  I would honestly rather eat fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=840

I was hoping to cheer up a friend who just had a family emergency and was disappointed by the complete lack of regard this place has for their patrons. For starters I called ahead to order curbside so I could save time. I was placed on hold and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait. I waited so long I was actually able to drive all the way to the restaurant before anyone ever picked up. On arrival, and as I was still on hold I saw and heard a manager, FINALLY pick up. I could hear him but he could not could hear me well as the check in area is loud with background noise and music. I tap him on the should and show him my phone saying, ""you don't have to take my curbside order now as I've been on hold for close to 20 MINUTES and was able to drive here!!!"" Does he apologize and proceed to help me? Absolutely not. He says, oh sorry they can help you 'over there' as he points me to a register near the cheesecakes which has a line of 9 people in it. I'm beyond annoyed at this point but am already here and want to make my friend happy as she likes their calamari. So I wait an ADDITIONAL 20 minutes in the line to order and ask at that time for the location general managers name. I was was told by the polite cashier that she would bring it to me. Surprise - she didn't. The variety and quality of food is good but the lack of organization and level of service unfortunately overrides any positive experience one could have here. Mistakes will happen but when they do, it's how you handle them that counts. While having this awful dining experience I had plenty of time to write this review.

Before I sat down, I asked the guy at the bakery counter if the restaurant served healthy food...you know...stuff under 400 calories. He said no. So I was sitting on the patio with my shitty latte, and decided to look at their menu on my Droid. They had humus, beets with goat cheese, and edamame.

Food took 35 minutes to arrive,  and my meal was delivered 10 minutes later than than the others at the table. 45 minutes at lunch is just NOT acceptable.

The eggs were cooked as ordered, and the sauce was just OK, overall I would describe my meal as below average.  Suggest you try something different.  My colleagues meals were about average.    This Cheesecake Factory location is busy....it has to be the location....and the kitchen is not really up to par.... they had obvious difficulty handling the load of diners.

My wife ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and it arrived with the main ingredients buried in the styrofoamy rice noodle things.  Which I enjoy, but it did make you wonder why they put so many on.  Well, once you got down to the salad you could see why.  It was just a bunch of sad, sad, wilted lettuce.  We should have sent it right back but I guess we prefer to be passive aggressive and Yelp about it later.  The wife gave it the ol college try, but it was so lacking in flavor that she had to give up.  She compared it to eating water logged lettuce.  I tried it and would have to agree.  Not much flavor and just a horrible consistency.   I ordered the Pit Beef sandwich, which was alright.  But the horseradish sauce, (which is what I was really looking forward to) was really just mayo that might have been on the shelf next to horseradish at one point.  No flavor at all.

The food of course is not gourmet, but the flavors are way better thank your average chain restaurant. The chicken madeira is good, the pasta with shrimp is also pretty good, the chicken marsalla is also a must have. Also, try the Navajo sandwich (huge) and their thai lettuce wraps.  I have rarely made it to dessert, but I usually have the plain cheesecake or the carrot cake. All in all a pretty good option for a restaurant in a mall, good for groups becuase of the many many items on their menu -beware because it can get pretty dang loud.....oh, and there are only 3 bathroom stalls which I find totally icky given the size of the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=840

Food is consistent, and it's a safe option when you can't decide what you want to eat, since the menu is extensive with a wide variety of choices. My Cesar Salad was standard, but good. Portions are quite sizable. I got the small and even that was hard to finish.  Our server here (I believe her name was Martin?) was super sweet, and attentive even though we came in the middle of dinner rush and the restaurant was super busy.

Michael L.,"Arcadia, CA",112,262,30,2.0,7/31/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory sadly disappointed me. I've never been taken care of so poorly at a Cheesecake Factory, and the Cheesecakes I had that day were subpar for sure. I came with two of my friends, and all of us were quite excited for their annual National Cheesecake Day with half-off Cheesecakes. The first thing we had was the bread. As thankful as I was that it was hot, the bread tasted worse than the other ones I've had in the past. Their rye bread doesn't have quite as much flavor or sweetness as what I've been used to. We each followed up with a lunch-sized portion of their pasta, getting Pasta Da Vinci and Louisiana Chicken Pasta. I had forgotten how much smaller their lunch portions are. It should still fill the average appetite, but their dinner portions may be almost twice the size of their lunch portions. Their pasta tasted the same as the others, so I was quite thankful for that. If you do plan on coming here for pasta, the two pastas we ordered are definitely the ones I would recommend. We concluded our meal with two slices of cheesecakes, their Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel and their Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. Both were mediocre. The Dutch Apple tasted as if it's been sitting out for days. The streusel and crust was extremely soggy and the cheesecake looked as if the middle deflated. Disappointing considering this is normally a $7 slice of cheesecake. The Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, was lacking in fruit flavors and was not as dense as I expect New York style Cheesecake to be. It could be that they mass produced these cheesecakes more than usual in preparation for the event, thus lowering the quality of their overpriced cheesecakes. For the normal price, I'd recommend going elsewhere for dessert. The waitress for my table did nothing to make our table feel any better about the meal. She pretty much ignored our table, perhaps noting that it was merely three college students. The waitress didn't fill my water cup up once, nor did she notice the times we tried waving her over. It literally took me to wave and speak up an ""excuse me!"" in order to get her attention. Another time we thought she saw us as she walked over, but instead she just put her back against us while she talked to the table next to us. Honestly, would it hurt you to pay more attention to us? Overall, the food was nothing special - if anything it's overpriced and lacking in flavor. Their cheesecakes were not nearly as great as I remembered. I don't think I'll be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory again. Especially since they don't offer happy hour here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=760

I don't know if my standards went up or something is wrong with this place but I seriously wanted to walk out of the restaurant in the middle of the dinner!!! I have been to Cheesecake Factory in SF, Palo Alto and LA...but SD has the worst food and services ever! First of all, the bread that they served wasn't warm... that's okay. It's not a big deal to me. Then, I ordered a passion fruit mojito ... when I took my first sip ... yikes I just taste syrup... the mint wasn't crushed... it's just flowing on my glass... so I told the server that this is tasting right to me ... his response was ""it can't be wrong because it was made by their recipe!!"" However, they offered to change my drink, so I decide to go with the regular mojito because I thought maybe the passion fruit flavor is supposed to be sweeter. When I got my regular mojito, all I tasted was just sprite and again the mint wasn't crushed... I wasn't the only person felt the same way. Something is wrong with their ""recipe""!  My bf got the bang bang chicken and shrimp... the server asked him if he wants white or brown rice... he goes with the brown. Of course, the plate came out with white rice!!! I ordered the garlic noodle with shrimp... the pasta was so dry and I seriously think I can make the same stuff... don't understand why it cost $17. During the meal, I was watching them how they set up their table... seriously... I can't eat my food anymore. There were trash all over the floor and they didn't even care to clean them. We didn't even finish 1/3 of our meals and we decided to leave...  The bill came out $73!!

Victoria L.,"San Diego, CA",103,3,,1.0,11/24/2015,"I am not one to waste time writing bad reviews, but I think everyone needs to know and Protest going to Cheesecake Factory In Fashion Valley mall San Diego. I went home from my experience shaking and I woke up to write this review, to let people know how horribly this place is run and to share the experience I had. My friend and I came in for a drink at the bar we only wanted 1 shot of tequila to relax after a stressful day working. When the shot was poured, it was so tiny we felt absolutely no effects from the shot because it was so small. Mind you, this is not just about the amount of alcohol received nor the cost.  It was our Harsh treatment and humiliation we received after we complained. The senior manager instead of trying to comp or pour a little more like a dime size more to pacify our disappointment..or even come up with a solution for that matter.. He became extremely argumentative. Borderline scary. Apparently the Senior manager- JT who ruined our evening has not had any customer service training in my opinion or how to deal with complaints as he accused us of attacking him personally in front of other ""guests"" in which every time I mentioned that we are the ""customers"" and that ""our complaints should be properly acknowledged"" he lashed out correcting us that we are ""guests"" not customers. This rude and tacky correction was said four times. Embarrassing and humiliating.  To make matters worse, he started to raise his voice in front of everyone causing a scene and eventually yelled at us to GET OUT pointing his finger at the door and quickly walked away from us, not solving anything not coming up with any solution whatsoever. Was appalled as I have had 15 years in customer service and this was absolutely unacceptable. This Senior Manager JT had absolutely zero skills. As a manager, if a customer is unhappy or upset you do whatever to be polite regardless of how the customer is acting. Service is Poor. Both managers and bartender were even tacky enough to bring up how cooperate runs Cheesecake Factory like we really want to stand here talking about that. Will be filing a complaint with corporate because I think feedback is extremely important and Even the manager would not stand to listen to our feedback. This place may look like a standard good place to go after shopping but go at your own risk you may leave mad and upset.  I took my daughter there for cake on her B day and the waitress brought milks first and cake 35 minutes later I had to ask 3 times where she was it ruined the joy of eating there. I will never ever go back to this place and I don't mind telling others not to go there as well. Went in to end our day with a drink to relax, left humiliated by The Senior Manager and shocked at the lack of service skills once again I will say the management does not care about its customers or ""guests"" as they call it.  I want to add only because this was involving alcohol-we were not drunk nor did we even get a proper feeling from the 10 dollar tiniest shot in the world. We did not order anything else but that, and left not only beyond sober but shaking with humiliation. So we basically paid 20 dollars plus tax to have a terrible experience that we will not soon forget.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=820

Like their cheesecake selection, their food menu is equally massive. Which is awesome, if you weren't so indecisive (which I am). I ended up getting a chipotle pasta. It turned out really good. Cream base with a touch of chipotle. Very yummy. Unique and delicious. I had a few bites of people's foods here and there, and I liked everything that I tasted. It seems like most of their options are all very creative and good. I was very impressed and would like to try more of their pasta.  Oh and if you haven't already, go google ""Serious eats cheesecake factory."" You will be impressed.. and inspired.

To lessen the guilt of having cheesecake while dieting I ordered the Factory burger which had the least amount of calories for an entree. It was really good, the bread had good texture and burger cooked perfectly.  And for the main star of the show, the cheesecakes are delicious.  I had the strawberry cheesecake which was very rich. One of my friends had the godiva which I found is too rich in chocolate, extremely sweet. And another friend got their 30th anniversary cheesecake and it was twice the size of my strawberry one. I find the serving size of the cheesecakes varied a lot but the price is the same for all of them.

Knowing that the cheesecake portions were huge I had an appetizer rather than entree prior to my cheesecake. The entree I had was Southwest Eggrolls. The eggrolls were full of flavour. Still enormous!  The cheesecake I tried this time was the White chocolate raspberry truffle. I have to admit this was not a favourite.

Same story at this location. We had to wait about 45 minutes for our table but that was ok since we had a large party and, to be honest, I was expecting longer since it was Saturday night. Our server was very accommodating of our wanting to split some plates, getting separate checks, and some of our party coming late. Props to her.  Two tips for anyone who hasn't yet been to a Cheesecake Factory: 1. These plates are ginormous. Don't believe me at your own peril. I always eat half of my entree and save the rest for lunch the next day. I suggest ordering something that re-heats well. 2. Don't be a dumbass, order the cheesecake. Trust me, it's pretty damn delicious and there are like 20 kinds, literally. I recommend the Chocolate Tuxedo, while one of my best friends swears by the Dulce de Leche.

Kristin B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",236,802,7220,5.0,8/11/2011,"The seemingly always present waiting groups of people outside this place is usually a deterrent, but my boyfriend and I hit up this conveniently located Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch on Sunday after an afternoon at Fashion Valley Mall.  Surprisingly, our wait was under the estimated 10 minutes despite the loads of people inside and out. I'd only been to one Cheesecake Factory location previously, in Pittsburgh, and really enjoyed the overall experience.  I have no problem giving good restaurant chains credit when credit is due, and Cheesecake Factory definitely falls into the Good Chains category for me. The perfectly medium-rare greasy Wild Mushroom Burger I ordered was hefty and wonderful--the second-best burger (behind Bare Back Grill) I've ever had in San Diego, actually.  I couldn't get enough of it.  Though in my heart I really wanted to spend an extra buck to choose sweet potato fries as my burger's side I opted for the side salad instead, which was nicely dressed and a generous portion.  Everything about my meal was top-notch, and my boyfriend was equally happy with his Memphis Burger. Prior to being seated while we'd briefly waited in line, we'd drooled over the numerous cheesecakes displayed in the glass cases up front.  I quickly decided to have a slice of the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, which our really nice waitress later explained is the most popular relatively new cheesecake available.  My guy wanted something really rich and chocolaty had a tough time making up his mind; with the help of our waitress, he ultimately decided on the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake.  Monster slices of our chosen cheesecakes arrived after we finished our burgers, and we gleefully slipped into cheesecake-induced comas.  Duh, I know this place is called The Cheesecake Factory, but, regardless, the cheesecakes were even better than they looked--my cheesecake photos didn't turn out very well, by the way--and even better than I'd anticipated.  Truly phenomenal.  I've thought about those cheesecakes a whole lot since Sunday. A perfect meal topped off with perfect cheesecake.  My belly and I couldn't have been happier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=860

I brought the family down from Temecula because they were stupid enough not to add one to the mall there. We ordered our favorite dish Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken and was very un impressed.  The flavor was way off, no bang bang at all and gross peas that weren't there before. Where's the green onion and the peanut flavor and the spice? Not to mention lack of chicken and shrimp, mostly rice for $18. Did your cook skip out for the night? Our waiter said he was going to mention this to the GM who he said happened to be there tonight,  but he didn't even pay us a visit? My kids ordered off the small bites menu and had a similar experience. I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL AT CCF until now. Something changed at this location and I hope they fix it because we were not happy. Of course the cheesecake is still good but that's only part of the experience.

I only ordered 3 slices of cheesecake. I waited and got to the restaurant about 25 mins later. Then waited 25 mins and called 2 times to find out what the hold up was. There were 3 other cars that got served before I finally walked inside to find out what was going on. I was then rudely told that I had to wait at least another 20-30 mins before I would be served. Why didn't she come out and tell me knowing that I was out there waiting. When I called to cancel the order, mostly cause I didn't want to go back and talk to her, I waited on hold for 10 mins before I hung up. Definitely won't be going back anytime soon.

The last time that I was here was a few months to a year after this place opened. I thought the place was way overrated, the menu was small, prices were high, and the food was mediocre at the time.  Service: It was definitely a whole lot better than before. There were people overflowing out the door waiting for a table. I put in my reservation for 2 and the wait was roughly 30 so they say. I took a walk around the mall and came back and to my surprise the line disseminated. We got a seat right away and the service pleasant. Food: The food was surprisingly delicious. Ordered the Chicken Samosas and to my surprise it was very tastely and wasn't too americanized from the traditional samosas. This version has just a hint of curry, enough to tantalize the tongue. I had the meatloaf entree and it was surpisingly hearty and good. There was 3 one-inch slices of meatloaf with a side of corn veggie medley and mashed potatoes.  Drinks: I just had water, but they serve beer and wine too. Overall:  To my surprise I have been rejuvenated that this restaurant chain made a complete 180 from its opening days. This place use to be an overrated joint serving over-priced salads, pastas, and entrees. Its a whole lot better now with better food, portions, and ambiance. Not too shabby.

AT ARRIVAL: the wait time was 15 minutes which seemed like a good start, until i realized once i walked in that there were empty tables.. once there our waitress did an excellent job attending us.  THE WAIT: its normal to wait 15-20 minutes for a meal at a restaurant. i didnt mind until i realized 40 minutes had passed. my date and i were about to leave when the food arrived.  THE FOOD: the food came in COLD. a HOT PLATE SERVED COLD???? the meat was rubbery and the rice was poorly made. the macaroni was interesting since i was expecting mac n cheese when i ordered it but it was four balls of cheese. i thought that was the best part. the waitress saw i wasn't eating my meal and tried to fix it. she was very kind yet i could not hide the disappointment. once our cheesecake arrived i figured its the cheesecake factory, at the least these will be great. the cheesecake was dry and hard.  THE BILL: after the most disgusting food i received the bill of $80 for our meal. personally i don't care of the price when i dine out IF I ENJOYED MY MEAL.

No matter the time or day you will usually have to wait five to twenty minutes to be seated. The fact that its always packed to the brim is really my one issue with going here.  The food is good enough, the portions are gigantic (especially the cheesecakes themselves), and the menu is varied enough that almost everyone can find something to order. That said, go when you're hungry or else you'll have leftovers for a week.  The servers are, for the most part, friendly despite the fact that they are always rushing around to accommodate everyone in their sections, and there's a fifty/fifty chance that you'll wind up with one of the really sweet, talkative waitresses.  The fact that the restaurant is attached to Fashion Valley mall means that parking is almost always ample, I recommend the parking garage directly West of the main entrance or the lot just East of the front doors.  I've mixed feelings regarding the atmosphere. While I enjoy dimly lit restaurants and having barriers separating the main dining areas I hate noise, and with so many people eating here all the time noise is unavoidable.

The location is very convenient as it is situated right next to the Fashion Valley Mall. Parking is rarely an issue unless the mall is full; usually on Saturdays is when it is most packed. I have to say the variety of food they have is astonishing however I must say that my most favorite dish is the Tomato Basil Pasta. The sauce is delicious and the pasta could not be prepared any better.  The only downside to this place is that they do not take reservations and the place is usually crazy busy on the weekends, so it would be wise to plan accordingly unless you are planning on waiting for a minimum of 45 minutes for a table. I also must add that the customer service is amazing and the servers take great care in assuring the customers satisfaction. Definitely recommend checking the place out for couples, families and even if you're in the area and just want to try some amazing food. Highly recommended!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=880

I ordered miso salmon and my rice was half uncooked. The waitress replaced the rice for me saying it was a new batch, and yet every bite there was several raw hard pieces of rice! (I even picked out the uncooked rice pieces to show her) I have ordered this dish countless times and this has never happened, I ended up packing just the salmon to go (will eat it with my own rice at home). The manager came by to say sorry and if she can replace the white rice with brown rice (what!?) I don't want to keep on tasting their uncooked rice as I am pregnant and I do not approve of my baby to continue to consume uncooked rice, but that's basically it. At the other Cheesecake Factory locations they would have replaced the dish to a different one or give us a complimentary dessert.

They NEVER take reservations so they make you sit and wait with these things that go off and vibrate when the table is ready. The staff is not very helpful and you can tell that they're unsatisfied with their jobs and it definitely rubs off on the way they talk to their clientele. The atmosphere is liken to its name a ""Factory"" in which they mass produce some high-calorie cookie-cutter type of food which really isnt worth your time or money.

W W.,"San Diego, CA",0,52,,1.0,12/19/2013,"My experiences with this establishment have always been less than stellar and the last one is the final straw.  I will attempt to be brief. I came here with my child, two of my sisters and their two children on November 9, 2013 for a late lunch.  We were seated immediately and thought that this may be a good thing.  Well, we were seated in a section with a tepid waitress who was thoroughly disinterested in us.  She appeared annoyed when I inquired about the gluten free options for myself and my child; she was unable to answer all of my questions (yeah, sorry, we have food allergies and she should know her business) and had to go inquire of the kitchen - a prospect that was obviously less than thrilling to her.  At least she got our orders in correctly. The food is good, but not spectacular.  Also, I had ordered a la cart and one of my dishes was forgotten.  Not a big deal, but the waitress never acknowledged it; rather, a random manager came by to tell me and to apologize.  Our waitress failed to check up on us or refill our waters; now, this is a pet peeve of mine as I drink about 4 to 6 litres of water per day.  It's the middle of the day.  I'm thirsty.  Please fill my glass; is it that difficult?  Apparently it was for her. I should mention that after finishing our meal, my child began to become ill.  Uh-oh. When our check came, there were some oddities.  We wanted to split the bill onto three cards so I was hard at work trying to do the math; I worked on it for 30 minutes but could not match up the totals.  I noticed that they charged us a mandatory 18% gratuity (that bent us a bit, seeing as none of us felt our server deserved that much even though we all typically tip around 20%), even though we only had a party of six!  Finally I realized that they weren't charging us 8% tax, it was more like 9.4%.  What?  Since our waitress had abandoned us, we asked another passing waiter about the tax rate; he didn't have an answer so he got a manager-who also didn't have an answer.  In fact, she said that since she was from Arizona, she didn't even know what the rate in San Diego was.  You know, I work in retail, as well as one of my sisters, and we both were dumbfounded:  how can you work in the service industry and not know the answer to our question???  At least the manager removed the difference from the total. At this point, my child was very ill.  On the way out the door I inquired after a manager I might speak to when I got home.  I obtained a name and called when I got home.  The man seemed empathetic at first and expressed a wish to have fixed it in the restaurant.  I explained that my child was becoming sicker and sicker and had to get home.  He also had no answers for me but told me to call corporate on Monday.  REALLY????  What kind of manager are you?  He became indifferent to the point of talking to others while I was on the phone with him - how rude! I did call Cheesecake corporate headquarters on Monday morning.  After speaking with a nice woman and her doing some footwork, the issue was resolved.  We were being taxed on the gratuity that we should not ever have been charged.  Wow.... really?  She refunded one of my sister's cards and issued a gift certificate for us to use.  However, I stressed to her that I live in San Diego and there are too many good places to eat for me to waste my time with their establishment ever again.  EVER. I WILL NEVER DINE HERE AGAIN.  I don't care if you're food is tasty, Cheesecake; your service is terrible and your staff is ill-informed.  Go cheat someone else, I'm done with you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=880

He hears me rave about it constantly so it was about time!! Unfortunately we went on a Saturday night so there was quite a wait, but I knew that was to be expected. I've visited this location during both busy and quiet times, and usually the quality of food is not affected either way. However, it appears as though the rush affected our food BIG time. Our appetizer (buffalo blasts) was the only thing that came out hot - too hot, in fact. They were soooo crunchy and overcooked! My spicy cashew chicken came out cold about 35 minutes later, and it was also about half the portion that I'm used to with this dish. What?! Is my memory just failing me?! The flavor also seemed...saltier? Maybe it's because I cook my own version of this  that I've become accustomed to. *Shrug* I enjoyed it regardless, but my boyfriend DESPISED his dish. He ordered a burger with bacon and fried mac and cheese on top, which sounded incredible to both of us. He said that the mac and cheese totally ruined the burger though - the cold, grainy gas station nacho-type cheese sunk into all the other ingredients and completely turned him off. I encouraged him to stop eating, split my dish, and voice his opinion to our server but we were so hungry after an hour and a half wait before we even got seated (and then over another hour wait for our entrees) that he was just over it. First time I've ever seen anyone unsatisfied with what they ordered, and my boyfriend isn't even as harsh a critic as me! I feel awful changing my rating since I am such a huge fan of this place (and our Reese's cheesecake to go was fab-u-LOUS) but this was a seriously subpar dining experience.

Calling for them after three tries - bad service.  As for the food, I got the factory combo of steak and salmon. Steak was tiny but good. Salmon-- eh, could have been better. My bf got the steak coulette something--- and it was something that we did not expect. It was a tiny piece of meat, and it was bloody raw. He asked for a medium rare and he got a bloody mess.  The size of the steak was smaller than a six-inch Subway sandwich, which we don't recommend. Plus, the menu said that it came with Onion Rings and fries. There were TWO onion rings and a menial amount of fries. The portion of fries couldn't even amount to the medium size fries at McDonald's.  The price, honestly, was expensive for the crap meal we got. We could have gotten a better service, a better price, and a better meal quality at a broke down Denny's in the ghetto.   Finally, the drinks were whack.

When i moved to San Diego, this was one of the first restaurants that caught my attention. First, it's located at the mall! Second, i think they strategically placed their outdoor tables right next to the mall traffic. You can see and almost smell the food as you are driving by! The words Cheesecake Factory pop out and lure you in without you knowing. They wait is often long, especially on Friday nights and weekends. Come early, otherwise be prepared to wait almost an hour. My favorite appetizer is the fried calamari. I love the marinara sauce that it comes with. They also give unlimited free bread and butter, and if you aren't careful, you can easily get full off of this. Their menu is so extensive. Several dishes from each category: seafood, chicken, beef, and pork. Many specialty items. You can come here every day for a year and still have something new to try. Your dining experience is not complete without ordering something from the dessert menu. After all, it isn't called the Cheesecake Factory for no reason. You can stare at their cheesecake display for a long time because, yes, it is that hard to decide on what to order. They also have cakes that are layers high.

It was nice to sit in the sun although there were plenty of umbrellas if you wanted shades.  We were able to order quickly and the food arrived quickly. I always love the Jamaican Jerk Shrimp with rice and black beans.  My girl always orders the sliders and she was delighted.  The French fries were hot and fresh and everything was yummy.  Our server was very pleasant.

Alexandria O.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,1,1.0,10/20/2013,"So this actually hard for me to write, because I usually love the Cheesecake Factory and it's my husband and I's go to place on a Friday night. However, I can't let this one go. At about 4:00 p.m. my husband I decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. When we got there, they told us it would be about a fifteen minute wait which was fine by us. When we were seated (outside), we had a wonderful waitress who took our drink and food order right away. I'm sorry to say I can't remember her name but she rocked! However after about 20 minutes we were approached by another waiter who tried to get our order then asked us if we had been helped. It seemed like there was a lot of confusion going but it wasn't really a big deal. What did bother me though, is that were seated right next to a large party, a baby shower actually who were very loud, especially with their drinking games. I didn't complain to the waitress though, I just wish someone had warned us or asked us if it was okay, since they got pretty loud after a few drinks. Anyway, no big deal. I ordered the fish and chips, one of my favorite dishes. This time though, I seriously wish I had passed. Why? Because about an hour after we had left, I became very sick. My job is to know about food, how it can be contaminated, along with food borne illnesses. After about 20 minutes of vomiting and some other horrific symptoms that I won't bother to horrify yelp with, I realized I had food poisoning. I spent the rest of the night in my bathroom. When I called to notify the Cheesecake Factory (as you are supposed to do) I got a simple ""oh sorry""and then hung up. I wasn't looking for anything, but I think I deserve a real apology. Anyway, we wont be back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=920

By the time everyone finished their food and ready to leave, it finally arrived . We brought it to our waiter's attention and he said ""there's nothing we can do about it"".

When my hubby and I walked in, there were people everywhere so I thought we were in for a long wait.( it was 12pm on a Sunday)  I was wrong. We were seated immediately! Yay! The place was beautiful! Our server was Jordan, and he was so nice. He informed us of what was on  the menu, this being our first time and all. I ordered a Monte Cristo sandwich and potatoes. The sandwich was fabulous, but, the potatoes were cold. Still very good. Hubby had fish and chips and he loved it. We made sure we saved room for dessert! We decided on the Reese's PB cake cheesecake. OMG! It could have fed 4 people easily, but, we ate it all!! :)  Jordan came back several times to check on us, refill our drinks ,etc. If I could, I'd come here every week, but, Fashion Valley is NOT a place I like to be.

We usually come on a Friday or Saturday night so we are pretty used to waiting at least 40 minutes (we usually get in quicker than that though.) I usually get their shrimp with angel hair and its always good! I've only tried their pastas and their calamari but I've never been disappointed. Their drinks are good too and not as pricey as people make them seem.  Their service is usually good and consistent except this past time we went.. I think our server was having a rough night and she somehow ran into someone who spilled our drinks all over the floor. It also took awhile for her to get us bread and our food took a long time too... but since we always get good service here, we will let this past experience slide.

Kyle W.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2014,"I will never ever eat at this place ever again. My fiance and I went in last night at about 9:30, an hour and a half before closing. We sat there waiting to be seated, watching them seat 4 other couples that walked in after us. We had to say something to them after the 5th person and it seems as if they just forgot about us completely, letting us stand there, 5 feet away from them, for 20 minutes.  They say us at a table that still had the check from the previous customers laying there. When we tried to get someones attention to come and get it, they just told us to wait for the waiter. After the waiter finally came, we ordered some drinks and an appetizer. She brought us out some water (no straws) and took our order. Since we didn't get any straws, I spent the next 15 minutes trying to get a waiters attention so that they could give us some straws. A guy said he would and never showed back up with them. Finally our appetizer comes out, 30 minutes after ordering it and we ask that guy for some straws and after about another 5 minutes he finally brings them out. We finish out appetizer and wait another 15 minutes for someone to come take our real order.  I'm honestly tired of reliving the experience in this review. We finally got our food at around 11:15 PM, an hour and 45 minutes after we arrived, the steak wasn't medium rare and it looked like it was just thawed out and thrown on the grill. The broccoli looked like it was run under hot water, put on a plate, and thrown in the microwave to make it hot. We finally left at around 11:25.  I could understand all of this if they were just extremely busy, but this was a Thursday night and they were not busy at all. Empty tables all around. This was just extremely poor service. I have never ate a restaurant in my life that had such poor service. I've been to this location before and I enjoyed myself. Last night, that was it for me. I will never come here again.

Christine M.,"San Diego, CA",85,223,72,4.0,10/26/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is a safe place to go when youre throwing a last minute get together lumcheon/dinner, although any time of the week you should expect to see a line. A great thing about this restaurant is that you can come in casual or dressy without being looked at funny. There are three dishes I take turn ordering here only because they are so worth the calories and of course I always order the Fried Calamari as an appetizer.  Their Ahi Carpaccio is seared and served rare- it's seared enough to give a crisp but as soon as you bit thru that initially, the rare portion melts in your mouth. It has a slight tanginess & sweetness that really go well together. Their Clubhouse Salad taste just like a turkey club sammich without the bread and it's very fulfilling. It's also very big so it's a perfect salad to share with someone. Lastly when I really wanna go all out and throw calories out the window, their Farfalle Chicken w/ Roasted Garlic is TO DIE FOR!! The ONLY con is that its way too garlicky but I think that's the whole point. Most pastas don't taste the same after it's been a day old and reheated, but this particular pasta still carries its same great taste even throughout the next day, reheated and all. And the CHEESECAKES!?!?! This is WHY its called the Cheesecake Factory. I'm pretty confident in saying that I've had slices or nibbles of almost every cheesecake offered here and they were all yummy, although some are just yummiER than others. I've not been disappointed one time with a flavor, even flavors that I would never EVER imagine to be slightly tasty has pleasantly surprised me. Great place, great food, great drink and great ambience is what this place gives to its patrons.

I often get too full to have dessert if I get an appetizer though. My favorite dessert is the 30th Anniversary Chocolate cake.

Judy L.,"San Diego, CA",10,126,,4.0,10/22/2011,"Leaving a review for the Cheesecake Factory feels a little weird, as there is usually one near a mall and the chain is everywhere. Pretty much go here when people are celebrating in a big party or something like that.  There's not much that needs to be done to make me happy at this establishment. Keep refilling my water. Bring me lots of that deeeeelicious oat bread. Don't mess up my order. Bam! Five stars and a nice tip.  Went to this place tonight for dinner with a friend. We were seated out on the patio in a nice spot next to a warm space heater. It's October and we can still enjoy a meal outside! We were promptly greeted by a server who was filling in for another waiter who was on break. He brought us bread and took our drink orders, and later refilled our bread basket. Thank you! Mmm bread. We placed our orders and waited. I asked for the grilled portobello on a bun with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries is the only reason I wanted to come to the cheesecake factory anyway.  Eventually we meet our server ... He seemed nice enough.  We get our food brought out by another server and I notice that my plate came with regular fries. I told her I had asked for sweet potato fries and she left the French fries (sweeeeeet!) which I was secretly overjoyed about. I don't know if it's impolite to ask the server who actually brings the food for things, but since she was going to get the sweet potato fries, I asked for ranch as well. She was so nice about it! And she came back quickly as well. Thank you so much! I wish I could have given her a tip.  Our server refilled my water periodically and checked up on us appropriately. Eventually we order dessert, the key lime cheesecake with extra cherries on the side, and he brought it out promptly and brought us new forks. It was delicious! Overall this review is mainly highlighting the great service received tonight. The food is sort of satisfying enough but nothing spectacular, but that's what is expected from a chain restaurant.

Here's a hint: get in early.  Came in last time around 4.30pm for an early dinner, got seated 10mins later.  Bear in mind, it was only husband and myself.  They also have the option of outdoor seating with heaters outside, which sometimes gives you a better seating and time placement than just opting for the dining in method. (inside is too noisy anyways, so maybe people with larger crowds would want to take their party outside??) Typhoon punch still kicking my ass and loving it.

But this was definitely the best experience I've had at a Cheesecake Factory! My friend and I were SHOCKED to find that it was SO crowded on a Thursday night. We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table but the wait wasn't bad at all because we killed time just walking around the Fashion Valley mall which was right next to it.  We ordered a really delicious ahi tuna roll for an appetizer. Pretty dang good! And we both ordered salads. I ordered the seared tuna tataki salad which was DELICIOUS. It came with lots of pieces of seared tuna tataki (YUM!), avocados, tomatoes, and a tangy wasabi vinaigrette dressing. I hate wasabi but this was amazing!  My friend got a different salad... it was some kind of southwestern tostada one. She asked for no cilantro but sadly, it came with cilantro, and lots of it! So she told our waitress and she was REALLY nice about it, apologized and took it away to fix it. While we were waiting, the manager  even came out and apologized, and said it would be difficult to take out every bit of cilantro since the salad has cilantro dressing on it too. So instead, my friend got the same salad as me and they didn't charge her for the mess-up salad.  Overall, the service was excellent here, considering how CRAZY BUSY they were.

S L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,173,,5.0,2/20/2011,"Just to clarify, cheesecake factory serves food other than cheesecake. Whenever I go, there's an inherent desire to purchase cheesecake. But the driving force that gets me there is often the entree. Environment: it's always loud. Cheesecake factory is one of the few restaurants that does not take reservations yet still manages to fill up for dinner and most times for lunch. Amazing! If they started allowing for public purchases of franchises, I would definitely invest. The tables are distributed well and at night, the restaurant is dimly lit. For lunch, lots of natural light penetrate the many floor to ceiling windows. Not too bright with just the right amount of light. Upon arriving, you head to the front desk to get seated or pick one a beeper. Gets crowded and some people don't understand how to form lines. Otherwise, no problems. Waiter/waitresses: all very friendly. Most of time, they're a bit younger. They come by frequently to check on you throughout the meal. Occasionally, they take breaks during your meal but their temporary replacements are more than adequate in providing service. Food: the best part of this culinary experience. There are several pages of appetizers and entrees to choose from. Have tried a good number appetizers including firecracker salmon rolls, thai lettuce wraps, spinach artichoke dip, and the cheese and crab dip. The favorite is probably firecracker salmon rolls which are served with a spicy thai flavor sauce on a bed of shredded radishes. The entree I always order is the thai chicken pasta. Only once has it been merely satisfactory. Otherwise, always tasty. Green noodles, large chunks of chicken, peanuts, some sort of bean, and bell peppers covered with a slightly spicy peanut sauce. So darn good! Desserts are alway a slice of cheesecake. The favorite is the kahlua coffee cheesecake. Hard to explain why. Maybe it's the perfect combination of coffee and cheese flavor that makes it so irresistible. Drinks: mostly stick with water. On occasion, will order the strawberry lemonade which is a bit sweet (might be from concentrate). No strawberry chunks within the drink. I think we've ordered a blended drink before.

I am not one of those critics that would go into details and explain the whole occurrence second by second but long story short the treatment is sometimes more important than the food itself.

Wesley U.,"San Diego, CA",64,1,,4.0,3/9/2011,"My buddy and I came here to celebrate my recovery from one of the worst bouts of stomach flu I've ever experienced. It was like that episode of South Park-- you know the one I'm talking about. The only thing that got me through that painfully delusional dehydrated shivering state was the thought that I would be able to enjoy some Chicken Madeira with Madeira Sauce (CMMS) at the Cheesecake Factory.  It's just plain tasty baby. 8) I would say most of the pleasure I get from going to the Cheesecake Factory comes from the experience I get every time I go there. It suits anything really: dates, family get-togethers, reunions, fun awesome drinking times. You name it you can have it here. What's incredible about this is that you can go here without trying real hard and it doesn't make you feel bad about doing it either (don't ask me how). On the other hand, if you decide to look good, this place WILL complement the shit out of you. Low lighting and nice earthy tones makes everything feel so much softer and comfortable-- it's pure american genius. It kind of reminds me of Gotham City. My theory on this is that they designed it around  the idea of Bruce Wayne, but that's another story. The menu is definitely complex and american. There's just so many delicious sounding entres coupled with advertisements that it just makes decision difficult. Luckily, they serve you bread with butter for free as an appetizer to keep you sated while you navigate through the quagmire that is the dreaded menu. That's basically why I usually just order the CMMS. This time, however, I decided against it in fear of relapse and utter destruction-- so I went for a pasta dish (you know, something easy).  I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic (FCRG) because everything on it sounded unfreaking believably delicious. Who can deny chicken and garlic coupled with pasta combined in a perfect unity?!  We waited, squabbled over whether or not it's gay for two moderately well-dressed heterosexual males to go to the Cheesecake factory together and order two iced green teas (us, sadly). We eventually came to the conclusion that we just operate as a two-man cell that doesn't give a HOOT about social norms. Conversations keep us well distracted until our food arrives. If I were to sum up the FCRG in a few words I would say it's rich, creamy, and strong. Not, however, like a good cup of coffee. When I eat dishes, I like to appreciate the complex interplay of changing flavors and textures that expresses itself on my tongue with every om nom nom. This goes especially for pasta dishes with me since I enjoy tasting the mild flavor but strong changing texture of the pasta.  When I was eating the FCRG I felt like I couldn't even taste nor feel the chicken let alone think of the pasta. I didn't even know there were other things present in the dish. All I felt was a strong overtone of moderately sharp garlic cream. I do believe that this dish could have been better with just 1/4th of the sauce they plated onto my dish, but that's just me-- I'm not the average american tongue that might enjoy such strong cream sauces.  I give the Cheesecake factory 4 stars since I believe it is the best example of american culinary capitalism. It's a great time whichever one you decide to go to (and ultimately the same), but If you want a mind numbing tasting experience-- go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=940
Maria P.,"San Diego, CA",16,9,,4.0,10/13/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a favorite for my friends and I, especially if we plan on seeing a movie after dinner.  I love salmon, so it's predictably my choice to order every time I go out dining. The Miso Salmon (fresh miso marinated salmon served with snow peas, white rice and miso sauce) is very nice, but I like the grilled salmon better.  Last week, I tried Rene's sandwich, soup and salad.  It was clam chowder Friday so that's what I got.  The salad was like a half a small salad; but the chowder was terrific.  I emptied the bowl down to the last drop. By the time I finished the soup and some of the delicious and warm whole wheat bread, I was full and satisfied, so I took the sandwich home, untouched. What I don't like about this restaurant is its business; good for them, not so good for us because it's always a long wait, especially on a Friday night.

Brittany L.,"Seattle, WA",91,20,1,1.0,8/14/2013,"I hate to read reviews that start out ""if I could give this place ZERO stars..."" but in this instance, I feel like I need to begin with that exact caveat. I feel like it NEEDS zero stars, because we didn't even get to eat there...  It was my aunt's birthday, and she called two weeks in advance seeking a reservation (we were going to have a pretty large group, around 20 people). The person who answered the phone said that they don't take reservations, but that if we came in around 5 pm on the night in question, things should be settling down enough to give us a wait of maybe an hour-- not much longer than that. A week later, my uncle (who was stressing about not being able to make a reservation) called back, and was told the EXACT SAME THING by someone else-- just come in around 5, they usually get a little quiet around that time, wait shouldn't be more than an hour.  So on my aunt's birthday, we get there at 5. The manager tells us it's going to be somewhere around THREE HOURS. My aunt, panic-stricken, looks at me and says ""What are we going to do??"" The manager (oh-so-generously) advises us that if we split our party into smaller groups, we could possibly be seated sooner. Thanks, dude. Over the course of our (admittedly short) interaction, he proved to be flippant, rude, snarky, and completely uncaring/unsympathetic. Thanks, bro, but we'll take our money elsewhere. I'm not angry that they were busy-- good for them! I'm not even angry that the manager was rude to my aunt. Well, ok, I am a little angry about that. My real frustration comes from the fact that my aunt asked him why two separate people would have told her and her husband on separate occasions that the wait would be around an hour if they came in around 5. His response? ""Oh, we tell everyone that."" No apology for misleading information, no nothing. If he had said that it was unusually busy, or ANYTHING that led me to believe they weren't DELIBERATELY misleading their potential customers, I'd feel a lot better.

It's sautéed shrimp with jamaican black pepper sauce with rice, black beans, plantains & mango salsa. ~I've gotten the Kobe burger a couple times & that's really good as well. Kobe Beef with Sautéed Mushrooms and Onions.  ~BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad is really good too. Dessert!! :D I always try to save room for dessert. The chocolate tower truffle cake is the best chocolate cake in the world.  The banana cream, oreo & red velvet cheesecakes are really good & I also like the lemoncello cream torte which is vanilla cake & lemon mascarpone cream. yummm Oooh & it's also a plus to run into some of the SJ Sharks players at their SJ location. :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=940

Angela C.,"San Diego, CA",106,253,60,4.0,2/13/2012,This location seems to taste better than other locations I've been to. They salads are amazing. I haven't had one yet that I haven't just loved. There is something on the menu for everyone. It is always crowded and I used to have nightmares about waiting in line. But actually at this spot I've never really had to wait all that long despite the huge crowds that I've seen. I guess because I always opt to take first available and seem to get seated outdoors which is just fine because it's either a beautiful say in San Diego or the heat lamps are warm enough to keep me warm.

I had the original hamburger and fries, which was good. I usually get the Smokehouse BBQ burger, but I wasn't feeling it today. I really like their burgers, always very well cooked and the buns are well toasted and buttered. For dessert I got the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which was very good.

This time's experience goes as follows: My bud and I arrive and are told 25 minute wait.  There are like 20 people waiting, we find that to be hard to believe but it seems like a decent wait time so we agree. I couldn't tell you how long we waited but we had so much to catch up on that honestly, I didn't think it took more than the 25 minutes. Our buzzer goes off and we hand it to the hostess, then she tells us to wait in a line for our number to be called! WHAT?! Anyway, we were called within about a minute and a half or so...I thought it was odd that they'd call us to wait in another line but whatevz. So we follow our hostess and are taken through to the outside....We were like, ""great, the losers seating."" NO! The patio seating is soooooo pretty. Lawn chairs, heaters, and waaaaaay quieter than the inside! The ambiance is awesome outside! Very romantic...not that I would know -_-.  Anyway....the bread basked they hook it up with at the beginning is BOMB....I love the brown bread....it has an ever so slight hint of sweetness. Appetizer: Fried Mac & Cheese....which I would never dream of ordering (I wasn't brought up on soul food)...It was amazeballs (literally, they were balls lol) 4 of them so we each got two.  Next up....we got burgers which I guess we were craving cuz we were originally going to go to Bunz (Across the street) I liked mine better...The Americana....oh so cheesy and stuff. Meat was thick and we asked for ""well-done""....It was ""well done""  It also came with mini buckets of yummy fries. Ok...so dessert....Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake! WHAT?! Yum....we had that to go and our waitress was nice enough to pack it with forks so we could try it before we left.  Ok....so the biggest awesome thing? When our busser took my plate away I told him I still wanted to eat my fries. He said ok and proceeded to just remove the plate.  A minute later, dude comes back with a new thing of fresh fries! Duuuuude! If that's not going above and beyond, I don't know what is! I'm really angry at myself for not getting his name. This man was amazing. Anyway....cool beans Cheesecake Factory! You are now yumz yumz in my book.  My bud and I plan on returning for a Cheesecake and coffee....ok, maybe an appetizer too....haha but we did get a bit too much food in the end....all very delish!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=940

Let's just get the bad stuff out of the way: the wait is horrendous, almost every night, there is a gonna be a bad wait. While the service can be up and down... one thing that is constant is the management that goes out of their way to please you. There have been times where my food hasn't been on par or was wrong, but leave it to management to come by and check to see if everything was okay. They have even compted my plate because of their mistakes. Their menu is chalked full of different items ranging from varies regions. There is something for everyone. Yes, it could get overwhelming but I think it works for them because in the end, the food is backed by them. I have a love/hate for their pasta dishes but their burgers and salads are huge! I hate them for getting rid of my pesto/pine nuts chicken pasta dish but I did like their Shrimp Franchesa. I love the Bacon Cheeseburger with onion straws. MM MM good. While their food isn't an ""orgasm for the mouth"", its pretty good and huge for the price you pay. Now its not cheap by any means, you definitely jump when you see the bill if hole-in-the-walls are more you... but the food is delicious and their service (can be sucky at times with the host/hostess and waiters).

Mandy M.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,79,52,2.0,12/30/2012,"Let me start by stating that my 2 star rating is not for the food or the server, both of which kept me from rating it even lower.  We arrived on Saturday night, December 29 around 7:20 pm and waited an hour an 45 minutes before begin seated. No problem, we were willing to wait. We spent the time waiting for our dinner table in the bar area. Our bartender was Tracy, a very personable and helpful bartender, 5 stars for him. We then were seated at our table, our waiter was very attentive and nice. The food was great. We ate our entrees, ordered dessert and that's where the experience goes south.  We were seated at a 2 person table with a four person table to my right and a 2 person table to our left. As we received our dessert, the apparent manager on duty seats a partial party of 8 on either side of us with the remaining 2 diners from the new party left hovering around waiting for us to leave. The tables on either side of us are now having conversations over us as we eat our dessert. We didn't even have our check yet.  One of the waitresses serving the area actually points out to the manager (dark brown or black hair wearing a maroon dress shirt and I think they were grey or khaki colored slacks) that it is not right to seat this party while we are still eating, and he yells at her. SHE WAS RIGHT. The manager is having this conversation with the concerned waitress directly behind me, offers no apology for the fact that we now have 2 tables of people talking over us, pushing for us to leave, never mind the grown men a few feet away leering at us as if we are in the wrong. It's unfortunate that the last 15 minutes of our evening ruined the experience, but it is an honest assessment and deserved based on the poor judgment exercised by the manager, perhaps he should receive some more training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1000

I love their spinach dip and you can never go wrong with their alcoholic drinks. I prefer their Mango rita thats blended. ITLL CRUNK U UP! I always go with the Chicken Madera for my main course.  It comes with a great slab of boneless chicken with an awesome caramelized sauce with mushrooms. It also comes with a huge serving of mashed potatoes and 2 asperaguses or however you call it. haha Their Dulce De Leche Cheesecake is to die for with the whipped cream and I always get it to go.

When Cheesecake Factory first opened in Mission Valley, it was the cool place to meet up and have dinner with friends.  Then, EVERYONE and their moms found out about the place.  The wait line turned from 30 minutes to 2+ hours.  Screw that!  So, I gave up going to CF. Four years later, open the Cheesecake Factory, in Chula Vista. Unbelievably, dinner wait time during weekdays averages 20 minutes.  Weekends are about 45 minutes.   Not bad, unless you were me yesterday and happened to show up for their 30th anniversary. I ran into a wall of bodies jockeying for $1.50 cheesecake slices.  1 1/2 hour wait to order and get your buck fitty cheesecake slice.  Average 45 minute wait for a table for four.  Party of 8?  75 minutes...luckily, that wasn't my party.  Definitely unusual for a typical weekday...but it wasn't really typical, was it?  Conveniently, there is a mall to walk around, if you don't want to hang out with the crowd and make some new friends. Despite the overall madness of crazy people wanting their slice of the pie, we were still promptly seated, within the 25 minute time frame.  Wait staff was quick and efficient.  (I always wanted to ask how they try to stay so clean, wearing their white uniforms.)  The decor is beautiful, but it is a bit dark, especially around dinner time.  (Does anyone else notice that?) More lights please!! Favorite dishes include the chicken marsala with mushrooms, the Chinese chicken salad or the lemon-herb roasted chicken with mash potatters.  Double-thumbs up for the dulce de leche, chocolate raspberry truffle or kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake.  Large enough servings to put this healthy (insert sarcasm here) eater into a food coma.  And, even though on the average cost of food is a bit pricey, it's still a great place to go to and enjoy.  If price is your issue, there's always happy hour!!   Even with all the chaos, the staff was on their toes and we even scored on the $1.50 cake craze.  Gotta appreciate that, especially when the average slice costs $7.  The Cheesecake Factory is a cool place to go to, even if it's just once in a blue moon.  Definitely, can't go wrong, when you got a sweet tooth to feed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1000
Megan B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",23,33,1,2.0,10/28/2013,"I am quite disappointed in our visit last night. Previously, we have visited the anaheim and riverside locations and they weren't anything to write home about but they also weren't awful either.  On to this location: we were seated right away even though the lobby looked full. I'm guessing those guests were waiting for the cheesecake line.   We were sested at 4:10p. We had a party of four that ordered soups and salads off of the lunch special meal. Apparently, when you order a salad, you should just expect lettece, tomatoes, and dressing. Nothing else. I was pleasently surprised with the size of the soup, I just wish the quality was equivalent. Canned soup. Yay.  My husband ordered the pizza and he hated it. It looked like a tombstone *frozen* pizza. Plain, greasy. We ordered 2 cocktains and they were just as much as our food but about the size of a low ball. They make sure to add lots of ice so it gets watered down and can fit in a bigger glass. 11.95 for a long island, but 8.95 for soup and salad?!  We left at 6. On a sunday afternoon it should not take almost 2 hours! Never again.  Ever.

I only wanted a salad, which apparently took them 30 minutes to bring out. And they forgot the dressing. I ordered the kale & quinoa for the first time, which should just be called the kale salad because that's all that was in it. I was already in a bad mood from being hungry so forgetting to add the dressing only made me angrier. I decided to call and let them know, and they transferred the call to the manager. I couldn't be bothered to remember his name but he seemed frustrated that I didn't know the receipt/order #. My mom paid cash - why tf would she keep the receipt? He proceeded to ask me a million & one questions, where I tried to answer the best I could (since I wasn't there). I even told him what my mom and sister ordered for dinner. He said he would try to figure out what he could do for me and get back to me. This obviously shouldn't take days. All I wanted was a simple apology. And when restaurants mess up they'll usually comp your meal (or send a gift card if it was take out) not pound you with unnecessary questions then lie about doing something about it and never reach out.

Cheesecake can be pricey, so I don't go too often because I'm a college student.  But, for a special occasion it's the perfect place.  Plus, while you're waiting you can go shop around the huge Fashion Valley Mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=960

I did. we sat. in less than 20 minutes v our estimated 1 hr wait. word! PARKING at a mall location, usually pretty easy to find parking and free.  FOOD Now we had some amazing plates.  Tex-Mex egg rolls with cilantro sauce-GADZOOKS thats good! Bang-Bang! chicken n shrimp w rice-some thai inspired dish that would make a re-run in the future Thai Lettuce wraps-my 95% vegetarian dieter amigo worked these wraps including the chicken--beware this refreshing yummy dish can be messy. but fun. assembly required. DRINKS Georgia Peach! hella amazing blended drink. I saw the bartender hooking this up and immediately changed my order. I was not disappointed. mojitos-sooooo good, and in a tall glass : ) SERVICE being at the bar we pretty much had it made just flagging down our bartender whenever we needed something. AMBIANCE crowded like bees round honey and LOTS of folks bring their kids, including strollers. lesson of this story is, don't come hungry. but by the time your seated with food in front of you, you'll be fine.

Christopher C.,"Buena Park, CA",500,238,45,3.0,12/22/2011,"I came here with about 20 other people to celebrate a couple friend's birthdays.  We were all adorned in ugly Christmas sweaters for fun :P Fashion Valley was of course packed! Of course, our party being so big, we had to wait a pretty long time even though one of my friends came at 3pm to make a reservation for 5pm. It's understandable. Our waitress was pretty helpful and fast although she did look like she wanted to get off work :P and later found out her shift ended in the middle of our dinner.  Maybe she wasn't going to get a chunk of the tip, hehe.  Anyways, the new waiter was pretty good.  He was on top of bringing our water and stuff. For me, the food is the issue.  I probably got the wrong thing, but I was splitting with a friend who is gluten sensitive so it couldn't be helped.  The bread was alright.  Not the best bread I've had, but not the worst.   We got the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo (although might've not been gluten free since gumbos are made with roux).  The gumbo came out with rice on top.  My first spoonfuls of gumbo were pretty much oil.  It was also really thin (so maybe they didn't use a roux). Although, the chicken wasn't overcooked and maybe a tad on the shrimp, but not bad on the meat.  However, I really didn't like their gumbo overall. Bleh. I had a bite of my friend's kalua cheesecake.  It was pretty good.  Although I would definitely not pay that much for one SLICE of cheesecake.  I could probably make a whole cheesecake with 7 bucks. Yeah, I'm not really a fan of Cheesecake Factory for their food.  I'm sure a lot of their food is just half-assed since their menu is freaking huge. Although one thing I did appreciate was that they individually split our bill!

Not that I have anything against greasy food but I almost feel like Cheesecake Factory makes grease a requirement for something to be tasty. I came here for an office party and got the Chicken Marsala. Their portions are huge. I like that the dish is really sweet from the Marsala Wine and that they pound the chicken into really thin filets. Their pasta is also cooked al dente. BUT, my meal was honestly COATED in oil--it was good however, it left me feeling so heavy and sluggish after my meal. Most of their meals actually make me feel this way.  I especially don't like that they are probably one of the few chain restaurants that still don't have whole wheat pasta as an alternative AND, they have a ""low carb"" menu with chicken that is served with WHITE RICE--cmon'! it's 2010, please learn to sub your ""healthier"" options with actual healthy options like brown rice.  It's the Cheesecake Factory so I guess I can't complain, you know what type of food you're getting once you step in.

The prices are fair for the portions you're getting, but I've tried several dishes over the last few years and nothing has really stuck out to be great...or even really good for that matter.

The pumpkin cheesecake--unfortunately they only serve it a few months out of the year around the holidays. Sad panda :[ Overall, not too bad.

Apparently the Cheesecake factory doesn't believe in actually cooking their food and simply serves reheated, plastic bagged frozen food. hey, I get it... they are busy, and it still tastes pretty good, but cheesecake factory management?  In the future, if you are going to serve reheated food from plastic bags like mcdonalds does, could you do me a tiny favor and MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL THE FUCKING PLASTIC OUF OF THE CHICKEN SO I DON'T END UP EATING A BUNCH OF TOXIC COOKED PLASTIC?

Annie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,63,,1.0,10/4/2012,"It was my first time dining at this location and it will also be my last. Six of us came here to celebrate my best friend's birthday, but I will speak for myself in this review.  My experience at this restaurant progressively worsened throughout the night.  After being seated, our waiter, Matthew, greeted us in a melancholy manner and remained impersonal and robotic the entire time.  He was not interested in creating a great dining experience; he seemed to question our satisfaction only out of protocol, not genuine concern. The birthday girl decided to order a cocktail, and as she was reaching for her ID, I told our waiter it was her birthday.  He nodded without a word or a smile and just stood there, waiting for her ID.  Don't people usually wish others a Happy Birthday out of courtesy?  When we asked if he could take a picture for us, he simply stuck his palm out, without a word, waiting for one of us to hand him a camera.  Is it wrong for me to assume waiters/waitresses should be personable and verbal considering they encounter people every day?  Our waiter was impatient and lacked interpersonal skills.  He made us feel unwelcomed and acted as if we were inconveniencing him. To top it off, our waiter did not take directions well when it came time to pay.  Our bill was $146.45 (gratuity included).  We paid $90 in cash and asked him to charge two cards with $29 each, totaling $148.  He did not bring us back our receipt or our change from our cash payment and somehow added a $4 tip on top of each $29 credit card charge.  When we explained his error to him, he did not apologize.  All he said was, ""I'll give you your $2.""  I was insulted and repulsed by his nonchalance and his lack of remorse. At the end of our meal, I calmly addressed my concerns with the Manager, Chuck, but even he proved unhelpful and offered no sense of concern for our discontent.  My experience at this location was contradictory to The Cheesecake Factory's company mission: ""To create an environment where absolute guest satisfaction is our highest priority.""  Our waiter dampened our spirits on what should have been a festive and fun night.  The service and experience I received singlehandedly shattered my positive image of The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=960

Service to me is usually consistent excepting one occasion when I wanted to kick my waiter in the face with my 5 inch heels. A notable mention is the last time we went there and my pasta was too al dente so I asked the waitress if she could just retoss it some more. She apologized and said she'll make me a whole new one.

Trey B.,"San Diego, CA",146,15,11,4.0,3/12/2010,"** Visited Tuesday 3/8/10 around 3pm. ** Let me first say that I am a cheesecake whore. WHORE! I would do ungodly things for the right cheesecake. So, suffice to say, if there is an entire factory for said divinity, you are likely to find me in front of said establishment trading sexually explicit and lascivious acts for mere crumbs. I've been to the locations in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace a couple times each but this is my neighborhood Cheesecake Factory. I went with my room mate Sarah on Tuesday between lunch and dinner (linner?) and it was one of our greatest foodventures! EVER! She started off with a Typhoon Punch, which was tastey and deceiptively alcoholic. I had a Sprite. For starters, Sarah ordered a full Caesar Salad and I ordered the Pizzette Margherita. The server recommended we down-size to the appetizer portion of the salad and we're glad we did! Even the smaller portion was HUGE and more than enough to share between the two of us. Sarah ordered the Chicken Madeira. She has her own entire review about it. I've had it before and decided to branch out with one of the seasonal specials, Chop Salisbury Steak. Per.Fec.Tion. My steak came burried under a mound of perfectly caramelized onions with fresh hand-mashed potatoes and baby spring green beans in a light butter garlic sauce.  I tackled the green beans first and was suprised at how a vegetable could be so light and rich at the same time. The potatoes were lumpy and delicious, as always, with a savory gravy made from the drippings of the steak, not the usual cream or dairy-based heavy stuff. The Salisbury Steak was also cooked perfectly. It was seasoned well, but not overpowering and all the components on the dish complimented each other extremely well. OF COURSE THERE WAS CHEESECAKE !!! (see first paragraph above) We ordered the Stephanie's Cheesecake to share for dessert. Two layers of red velvet cake between two layers of original cheesecake plus one layer of sourcream frosting equals five layers of cheescake orgasm! Our server was attentive without hovering. And the portions are enough to fill you up and still have some to take home for another meal - or at least a heavy snack - so you don't feel bad that the entrees range from $12 - $20 (up to $40 for steak entrees). We spent $100 between the two of us, but that includes a refill on Sarah's Typhoon Punch and us each having a full course meal with enough to take home, two large appetizers and a dessert to split. You could easily get away with $20/person if you're a little more cautious. But I had just received my tax return and this was a FOODVENTURE! The only thing I could ever hold against Cheesecake Factory is how self-important it is. I'm not sure what rustic Italian Renaissance-esque decor and 30' ceilings have to do with cheesecake, but I always feel like I'm eating in a museum. A little better than fast casual dining, to be sure, but I could do without the gourmet posturing. I will say that we have used Cheesecake Factory many-a-time for Birthdays and group events, but we usually get shunted out to the patio. They are pretty good at handling large parties as long as you don't want to sit inside. It would be much more convenient if they accepted reservations. If you're gonna be that posh, at least give me the illusion that I can secure a table ahead of time. Mos def one of my favorite places to eat, especially if you're going to indulge! ***** for the aMAYzing food, form beginning to end -*      for the stuffy ambiance.

Mine was ok, except the server forgot my side and when I told him, he failed, once again to apologize for the poor service.

Jacquelyn Q.,"San Diego, CA",180,155,17,2.0,11/24/2009,"This is, by a landslide, the most overrated restaurant in San Diego. I understand that the location in the middle of the insanity that is Fashion Valley Mall provides for a ton of foot traffic and I guess having a ridulously-lengthy menu would work best for big groups because there truly is something for everyone, but the truth is that the The Cheesecake Factory does not deliver good food or great service -- both are just ""meh."" I have been to this location at least a dozen times in the last few years for family functions (my husband's mom loves this place for some reason) and most recently for the anniversary lunch of a co-worker. Each time I am annoyed beyond belief at the insane parking situation, the masses of people standing in line like they are at Disneyland waiting for a table and the general feeling that I am in the middle of mayhem.  The employees are ice cold, look overwhelmed and apathetic to the fact that you may have waited an hour for a table or had to ask five times for a drink refill. Especially with a large group, the service suffers the most at The Cheesecake Factory. Good luck getting their attention, because your server may not be back for half an hour...  Regarding the food, it is OKAY. I have had many of their entrees and, while they have never been horrible, for the price (around $20 each entree), I guess I have higher standards.  If you insist on eating at a chain, walk across the packed parking lot to PF Chang's and have some lettuce wraps and Mongolian beef for half the price and ten times the taste.

Vicky L.,"Palo Alto, CA",811,1621,112,4.0,9/11/2006,"What amazes me about this place is that I can drive by Fashion Valley at 330 PM on a Wednesday to go shopping and there is a line outside Cheesecake. I think the only time I don't see a bunch of people out there is in the middle of the night! I swear, people are there ALL the time.  The food there is moderately priced, except for the cheesecake. It's outrageously priced. The Ralph's in La Jolla carries their cheesecakes for a fraction, same with Costco. But I guess having a slice at the end of dinner or lunch is part of the whole dining experience.  They have definately done very well in standardizing all of their dishes. I have visited multiple locations and the food generally is excellent and tastes exactly the same everywhere.  Appetizers are ingenious, and the entree's are very large. Salads are quite creative too.  Arrive early, the wait can be horrendous. My ex took me there for V-day a couple years ago and we stopped by at 4pm to put our names down and then wandered in the mall for awhile, to come back in time to eat at 7!

Our table was sticky & it took forever for our food to come out.  Our waiter seemed like a pretty nice guy - said he was embarrassed about the wait so he had the manager bring our food out himself.  The manager never apologized or explained why there was a delay.  We took our cheesecake home to eat later.  It was great as usual.  For the money we paid, I wish our time at the restaurant had been more satisfying.  Probably should've eaten dinner somewhere else & just picked up cheesecake to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1080

Sarah L.,"El Cajon, CA",4,18,,2.0,10/30/2011,"Normally we love the Cheesecake Factory, but our last experience here may have turned us off for a while.   We ate dinner here on a recent Saturday night.  Things started just fine.  We were put on a wait list, called within the amount of time quoted to us and given a little table outside.  After that- everything changed.   Our waitress arrived at the table sort of distracted.  As she was taking our drink order another member of the wait staff came by and dropped off bread at the table.  It was more of a drive by bread drop than anything.  There was no butter with the bread.  Not a big deal, but a little strange.  We never say anything about this, but it plays into the rest of the meal.   We order our food and about 15 minutes later my entree comes but there is no sign of my husband's.  The waiter who delivered our food asked if my husband was eating.  He told him he was and what he ordered and the waiter says he will look into it.  I proceed to wait for them to deliver the other entree.  Ten minutes go by and our waitress comes over and asks if my husband enjoyed his food (I suppose she saw no plate and assumed he had finished and it had been cleared?!)   We told her the food had not come and she said she would look into it. Another ten minutes go by and the waiter who delivered our food comes back and says there was no record of my husband's entree but he put it in and it would be out shortly.  Five minutes go by and the manager comes over to apologize.  Mind you, he still does not have food, and I am waiting for him to eat.  His food finally arrives and the burger is cooked wrong.  At this point my food is cold, but we're hungry and are really not complainers, so we just eat.   The bill comes and we were sort of expecting a free slice of cheesecake, or a comp entree or something for the giant mix up, but there is nothing.  In fact, they have charged us TWICE for his entree.  It takes another 15 minutes to sort this out.  I give them my card to pay and butter is delivered to the table.  Mind you at this point the plates are cleared the bread is gone and we're totally turned off of the Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Valley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1080

Cat A.,"Orange County, CA",1341,412,3748,4.0,1/10/2010,"I know what you're thinking... 4 stars for Cheesecake Factory? Yeah, so...I love the place!  Wait time is an hour you say. Eh, sure, go ahead and give me one of those buzzer thingys. We can just scope out the bar and see if we can slide in on some peeps that are leaving.  (Eyeballing tables to see how much food is left)  Oh there's one. Nope. Well, let's see if we can just order a cocktail then.  Drinks....damn, not cheap and not strong. But alright... tick tock...  Now I am freakin' starving.  I can't go over everything I've ever order. I've been going to Cheesecake forevAr. The menu hasn't (really) changed and the portion and taste hasn't either. I must admit my faves are the following:  -Artichoke and Cheese Dip: Oh so creamy. Filled with artichoke and full of warm, gooey, cheesy flavor. -Calamari: This is one of my favorite grubs anywhere. They do well by it here.  -Thai Lettuce Wrap: Messy but somewhat healthy and filling. Lots of dipping sauces that I'm a fan of. So.... maybe it's not so healthy. It's enough for a meal and not just an appetizer.  -Shrimp and bacon club: Big and plentiful pieces of sweet, tender shrimp and smokey bacon. Oh, their fries, me likes. Absolutely perfect meal for lunch or dinner.  -Chicken piccatta: Sautéed chicken breast with lemon sauce, mushrooms and capers. Served with angel hair pasta. Enuff said.  -Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp: A thai dish that is a bit ""americanized"" but still full of curry yumminess.  -Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken: C'mon... I heart rotisserie chicken and I heart this. Really juicy, savory chicken. The mash potato is something I stay away from not because it's not tasty, but because it'll fatten me up in two bites.  -Salads: You can't go wrong with whatever meat/topping/dressing combo.  Anyway...let me stop there. Obviously I've tasted quite a few things...several times over. And to say that you'll have leftovers, is an understatement. And regardless that it's a chain, I have never frowned at anyone when they mention wanting to eat at CF. I know there's other places to try but I don't ever mind ending up here. It's pretty cheap for all the food you get and I have always enjoyed each and every meal.  Basically, you come here knowing you'll have to wait. Service has always been friendly and professional at this location as well as the others I've been at. They are always running around, but will make sure they get your food to you as soon as they can and will come back to check on you thereafter. So all is good on that too. CF has just given me many years of wonderful memories of good eating with good company that I needed to give it some love. But I have left the best detail for last.....  Ahhh,  .- At the end of it all, a bite of you and all that coffee-ish, cocoa-ish creamy goodness, is what solidifies this eating journey's worth it's wait.

Meg M.,"Los Angeles, CA",961,170,138,4.0,7/26/2007,"My love for the Cheesecake Factory began when I was young.  Growing up in Agoura Hills, the Original Cheesecake Factory was right down the street from us in a commercial area ... BEFORE they served food....hence the name, The Cheesecake Factory. Soon, they added a cafe type menu and were only open for lunch, usually only seating MAYBE 20 people at a time.  I used to love leaving my high school campus for lunch to get the Lunch special BBQ chicken pizza, salad and a piece of cheesecake.  Now years later, it never ceases to amaze me how much the restaurant chain has grown, and how insane business is.  Now, I usually stay away since the lines waiting to eat there appear longer than a marathon race.   Today, was different.  A friend of mine and I hadn't eaten all day, so we decided to head over early for ""Linner"" figuring 4:30 shouldn't be too busy.  We were seated right away on the patio and handed the novel they now call a menu.  What a difference 15 years makes! HA! Being that I wanted to save room for CHEESECAKE, I decided on the Lettuce Wraps... they were so yummy!  HUGE portions, 3 different sauces and a bunch of different additions to the marinated chicken make this appetizer a meal!  Light and refreshing, even with romaine lettuce instead of ice berg, the lettuce wraps were a perfect answer to linner. ;-)   And most importantly, I had plenty of room for cheesecake... (well, 1/2 of one) It took me another 15 minutes to go through the dessert menu, and I finally decided on my old stand-by, T he Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake..also known as HEAVEN. Layers of our Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse and Chocolate make up this decadent delight that dances on my tastebuds (nice alliteration, huh? lol) The perfect ending to a great memory of my youth and I still have a 1/2 a piece of heaven in the fridge!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1060

V M.,"San Diego, CA",3,45,2,1.0,6/20/2014,I will make sure this goes to David Overton.This is the only Cheesecake Factory that has smaller portions... Honestly you have changed for the worst. It used to be a pleasant experience and now it's all about eating your way smaller portions (because of a raid they had a couple of years ago with illegal immigrants chefs being kicked out by the Feds) and horrible service . I choose the one in downtown because it's way better and the portions are way bigger and guess what??? The price is the same.

Sarah V.,"San Diego, CA",182,145,24,4.0,10/18/2009,"I ordered the Chicken Madeira (Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes) and a Typhoon Punch (Stoli Raspberry Vodka with Passion Fruit, Pineapple and Orange Juices) is DELICIOUS. It didn't taste like it had much alcohol it in at all but after two of them I was pretty buzzed. Top it off with some strawberry cheesecake and I'm in food heaven. Regarding their other foods.... a lot of forgettable blah stuff. I'm talking mainly about their pastas. The atmosphere is nice. There's always a wait though so get someone to show up early. ^_^ Some of the other reviews complain about the service here but I've had nothing but good-great service here. The waiter we had when our group of about 20 people was awesome. We didn't have any food mix ups and he kept the drinks coming. I don't think anyone ever had to sit there for very long with an empty drink. So to sum it up...

Contessa S.,"San Diego, CA",348,110,54,5.0,4/19/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the only chain restaurants that I'll happily promote. First of all, who doesn't love that soft, warm brown bread...pumpernickel, is it? Last time we asked if we could purchase a loaf before we left and instead our fabulous waiter brought us two complementary loaves. Now that is how you get extra tips!  Yes, the portion sizes are a food coma waiting to happen. Yes, you'll probably have a long wait if you go on the weekend. But it's so worth it! The Luau Salad is the best salad I've ordered anywhere. It's perfect. Trust me, if you like salads with a hint of sweetness (it has savory pieces of mango and a lightly sweetened vinaigrette dressing), you will not be disappointed. I also recommend the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, Chicken Madeira and Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (it's bangin'!). I've been switching between these dishes for several years and my love for them has only grown deeper. I have ventured out to try some other dishes, such as the Pasta Da Vinci, Cashew Chicken and Grilled Chicken/Avocado Club, which have all been good, but I always find myself going back to the ones I love.  My favorite cheesecake is the pumpkin, but it's only offered in the fall/winter so that's usually the time of year when I'm frequenting Cheesecake Factory. The Godiva brownie sundae is good, but it's extremely rich (and huge) so only get it if you're sharing with a few people. I'm also a fan of the peach bellinis.

Sean D.,"San Diego, CA",6,16,2,3.0,8/27/2009,"I've gone to The Cheesecake Factory twice in my life. I lived in San Diego for 8 years before going my first time because it was always so damn busy. After I got old enough and waiting around wasn't a big pain like it was when I was 9, I went, and was really underwhelmed with the experience. Part of the big draw of this place beyond the cheesecake is the enormity of its menu, and it's true, I was pleasantly surprised to see all the kinds of food they had despite their narrow title matter. I can't remember what I got the first time, but the second time I went I got shrimp with angel hair and it was really nothing to get excited about. I asked my family if their food also seemed lacking and we all seemed to agree that it wasn't up to standard. It kind of put into question to me whether a diverse menu was really worth ooh-ing and ahh-ing about if all of it is really pretty mediocre. Of course, it's the cheesecake that's the title player in it all, and damn, the selection of it put my tendency to be indecisive in the spotlight. I got the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake and it was pretty freakin' delicious, and taking a forkful of it followed by a forkful of my sister's Kahlua Cake (any chocolatey cake will do) made it even better. Expensive as hell? You bet. But cheesecake in general is expensive, so I suppose if you're selling any expensive good, especially if it's one that you're famous for, you have the right pillage the pockets of your patrons. In a nutshell, the meals are pretty mediocre but the cheesecake is top notch. It's too bad they're always so freakin' busy all the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1140

I definitely go to cheesecake factory more for their desserts and cheesecakes as oppose to their food. There appetizers may actually taste better than their actual dishes. Cheesecake factory has a myriad of tastes and choices, you can get something Asian inspired to Italian pasta.  I love their avocado eggrolls, its definitely enough for lunch if you want something light.  Dishes: jambalaya pasta: disappointing. I ordered this and there was no sauce on it. It was dry, they put sundried tomatoe in it and it was still hard and inedible.  They do however, give a good portion for a good price. It's a great place to go with a huge group of friends who has different tastes and preferences. This is always out default restaurant when we can't make a decision.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1100
Leah R.,"San Diego, CA",0,23,,1.0,10/7/2014,"*This review is for to-go/curbside ONLY-their dine-in is fine. Two terrible experiences with this particular cheesecake factory and their to-go team: 1st: So I used to work in the mall, and everyone knows how precious each minute is for lunch time when you are hourly. As a fellow service member, I have so much sympathy for food service and understand how tough it must be to please people when they are hungry. So i come in ordering two slices of cheesecake for myself and a coworker and it was pretty empty on a weekday. I was the only one in line for to-go, and everyone else was waiting to sit in the restaurant. I order my cheesecakes with Guy #1, and Guy #2 starts prepping for them. Guy #1 then turns his back to me (which is fine) and starts gabbing about his date to his other coworkers while Guy #2 makes my cheesecakes. He finishes in about 3 minutes and sticks them on the counter. Guy#1 is still turned around and does not see these cheesecakes are done. I'm still standing there waiting for him to realize they are done. I could have reached for them, but seeing as I'm only 5 feet and their cheesecake display counters are high I couldn't reach. I finally got them after another 5 minutes of Guy #1 chatting about his potential Friday night plans. 2nd: I called in my order on a Tuesday night at 6:52 (saw the receipt) and knew I would be there in around 10-15 minutes for curbside. Once again, I ordered 2 cheesecakes and some bread thinking these things were already made and just needed to be in place in to-go boxes and bagged up. I arrived at 7:04 and called them informing Erica I had arrived and was waiting outside. In between calling and FINALLY getting my food, two cars already got their order which were hefty family orders of appetizers, entrees, and cheesecakes. I kept thinking what the heck? I just ordered 2 cheesecakes? Finally, this girl comes out at 7:23, but she had to ask me for my name as she brought out the wrong order. She took my $20 and said she'll be back with the change and the correct order. It took her another 10 minutes to do all that. I finally got my food at 7:30. The whole process took 40 minutes for 2 cheesecakes (and they forgot the bread). She also didn't even give me the correct change, just breaking my $20 asking me ""what would you like back?"" In my head, I'm thinking...""all my change!!!"" But, I had to settle for 3 dollars back since this girl didn't understand the concept of breaking my $20 with change and everything. (I didn't want to tip her at all, but i settled for $0.36 when I was planning on just giving the whole $20 if they had given me my stuff on time).  Anyways, don't do to-go or curbside if you want a LOOOOOONG experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1100

C F.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/11/2011,So as soon as we were seated at our table the waitress gave us rules because we were such a large party.

Instead of asking how old the birthday girls were she stuck 24 in and failed to figure out that they were turning 17. On top of that I could not even take a decent picture of the cake with the candles spread out in no order. As i asked for her manager he came and laughed about the whole situation and say i cant do anything about it. When i then got make check she said she wasn't going to charge us a plating charge in which we didn't even ask her for and that that was all she could do.

Sarah T.,"Washington, DC",130,111,12,4.0,1/22/2010,"This is actually a 3.5 (Yelp really needs to give us the 1/2 option..) However I'm rounding up because they did make me happy in the end!  I have lived in San Diego on and off for nearly 10 years (give or take 6 months or so..) and I had never been here before. (I'd eaten a slice of their Cheesecake here once with an ex who didn't want to eat inside.. So we got it to go and ate it on a bench outside.. Yeah that's why he's an ex... Anyway..) It was good but I didn't feel I'd experienced The Cheesecake Factory well enough to say I've been there before.  Last night my BF was determined to have me eat here. He called to find out if they had any specials or happy hour, the host wasn't very helpful.. Simply put: No. When people call you to ask why they should go to your restaurant, it's your job to tell them why and make them WANT to come, the guy on the phone was very short and curt with us. MINUS ONE.. We decided to go anyhow, because my BF knew I'd love it.. We went 6 different ways to get here and all were flooded.. Ick, eventually we completed our mission and arrived.  When we walked in I overheard the hostess bitching to another girl about a couple wanting a booth.. That girl rolled her eyes and said ""Of course they do..."" Snobs, who cares if a couple wants some privacy while they enjoy their meal. The hostess greeted us and took us to a table.. shared by about 5 other groups (One long bench with several tables in a row...) I'm sorry but I didn't want to sit next to a bunch of strangers while I gorge myself on their massive menu. I ask for a booth and the girl looks like she might slit her wrists. ""We don't have any booth's available currently..."" I respond with a huge smile, ""It's okay, we'll wait."" She nearly stomped back to the front and I see the other girl roll her eyes again. MINUS ANOTHER ONE.  We were seated about 4 minutes later (Seriously, I went to the restroom to wash my hands and when I came out our table was ready...) It was a booth right by the kitchen.. (Ugh, better than the first option.) We sat down together and I couldn't believe how uncomfortable the bench was! I mean, I've got some serious junk in the trunk but my padding wasn't helping at all! I felt like I was sitting on nails it was so uncomfortable. MINUS THE THIRD ONE I hate uncomfortable seating, it makes me feel unwelcome.  Our server came over and things finally started to get better. He was much friendlier than the girls at the Hostess Station. We ordered a bottle of wine the Pinot Noir Mark West & my BF got a beer. For our appetizers we ordered the Avocado Egg rolls w/ Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce and Stuffed Garlic Rolls. The egg rolls were phenomenal and that sauce so amazing! I will go back here simply for this item! PLUS ONE! Unfortunately the Garlic Rolls came out cold (easy fix though, they took them back and brought out some new ones). They were tasty, the cheese on the inside was mediocre & I didn't taste enough garlic.. MINUS HALF OF ONE (how do you mess up a cheese, garlic, & bread combination?) For our entrees we ordered the Crispy Chicken Costelleta & the Farfalle w/ Chicken & Roasted Garlic (substituted penne pasta instead) When our food came out I was SHOCKED at the portions! My plate of Chicken alone could have fed a 3rd world country! Both dishes were delicious! The pasta had huge slivers of garlic and was so full of flavor! The Chicken Costelleta was so tender & juicy with such a great crispy exterior (oh and the lemon sauce they serve it with is mouth watering!) Neither of us finished our plates, YAY for leftovers!! At this point I didn't know if I could manage a slice of cheesecake, but my stomach surprised me when I took a look at the menu.. Kahlua Cheesecake or Coconut was the decision.. It all looked good but it came down to those two. Coffee won out and I picked the Kahlua... OMG it was so decadent! Absolutely delicious, after three bites I was satisfied and knew it would be going home with me as well. The manager was nice enough to check on us after our Garlic Roll mishap and when my BF asked, he gladly had them comped from the bill. (That made me happy!) PLUS ANOTHER ONE.. So all in all for a hundred bucks we got: A good bottle of wine, 2 apps (one comped), 2 entrees, a slice of cheesecake, & leftovers for the next day! 3 1/2 Stars! Food was great, Server (Thomas) was friendly & honest while giving recomendations, but the Hostess Station Sucked..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1100
Flora K.,"Corona, CA",32,117,29,1.0,10/10/2009,"So mediocre and overpriced with unecessary huge portions. I have also experienced problems with service here.  Obviously, if a restaurant menu has EVERY type of cuisine on it, you know that they probably aren't really good at cooking any one of those things. The Cheesecake Factory is not a Mexican restaurant, yet they have mexican on the menu, likewise for asian, indian, and italian cuisines. I ordered a plate of chicken enchiladas. The plate was huge and had tons of food, yet everything tasted so mediocre. I found a disgusting curly HAIR poking out of my enchilada. I told the waiter and he told me that I was wrong, it was not a hair, and it was actually from a corn husk. Yeah. RIGHT. He then offered to get the manager for me, because I was not satisfied with his explanation. The manager came over and told me the same thing. She offered me a new plate, but obviously why would I want a plate of the same thing I found a hair in, or any type of food at all. My appetite was gone. I declined the offer for a fresh plate and she did not offer me any type of discount. Both the waiter and manager still would not admit it was a hair.

The hostess checked her computer seating chart and said yes  it was available.  I was escorted to that area and as I neared table XX I noticed two people were seated there. There was nothing on their table (no drinks, food, etc.) except the silverware which was already preset on every table in the restaurant. The hostess who was escorting me there saw the same thing and asked if I wanted to talk to the manager.  We walked all the way back to the lobby and again I asked the hostess if her computer showed that seat available when I arrived. She verified again and said yes.  The manager on duty, Gary, finally came and refused to re-seat the guests, who had changed tables WITHOUT asking or notifying the hostess. Instead Gary LIED about it saying that there were ""100 people waiting in line"" and said he 'told all 100 people to sit wherever they wanted' (and didn't bother to inform the hostess).  Do you believe a manager would say this to patrons at the CF? No way!  Gary was less than professional with me and my friend.  We were seated in an extremely busy area alongside the north windows.  While I was eating my friend was talking to me when these same customers who changed themselves to table XX stood next to our table and the man at the top of his voice yelled out loud, ""you can have the table now!""  Silence followed as diners within the restaurant looked over to our table to see what was going on.  During that time there was an employee standing right next to my friend at our table that heard and saw the whole thing.  I asked her to get the manager.  An assistant manager was sent to our table.  This was unacceptable of Gary to improperly handle the situation causing this to come this far.  We were lucky that a physical altercation didn't occur. Later, I received a call from their corporate customer contact telling me that I was not welcome any longer to eat there!  OMG... It was not my fault that their manager, Gary, couldn't do his job nor that he lied about the whole incident which could have been averted had he handled the situation as a manager instead of a sheep. The CF is well known for long waits, pricey food and slower service. There is one server, Chris Corey who is their conscientious, hard working, pleasant, efficient, personable server. It's extremely difficult to find a parking and then to be hassled with the loud chaos inside their restaurant. Many times I would pay $5 (upfront parking garage which is not ""upfront"") to park and then walk to dine there. Are you new parents?  Kindly train your kids how to dine out BEFORE going to nicer restaurants. Infants should stay home with the babysitter, their dad or their grandma.  I rarely go out to eat but when I do I despise having my meal disrupted by babies/kids yelling/crying or throwing food around on the floor (or on others) and their mother (who only wanted to show off her kids at the nicer restaurant) sits there acting like she doesn't hear or see them causing havoc. There are many other restaurants to choose from such as Denny's, Coco's, Chuck E. Cheese, Mimi's, etc. where the kids could eat until the kids are older and better behaved to be taken to the nicer restaurants.  Be considerate of others who are there to enjoy their meal and time with others.

There is virtually no wait.  The service is 50/50.

Eric G.,"San Diego, CA",15,128,6,3.0,8/5/2009,"This is considered to be one of the nicer establishments in town, and I agree with this only partially. First, the wait. Expect to wait 30 minutes -on a slow day. Weekends.... Forget about it. I know they're popular... I just don't know why. The place is defintiely 'classy', but that doesn't mean most of the food is any better, and the service definitely doesn't even contend with some of the lower class burger joints like TGIF and Applebees. If I'm going to pay $30 for my meal, and wait thirty minutes before I'm even seated and given a menu.... I'd like the service to be a bit more attentive. With respect to the waiters and waitresses there, it's not their fault. There simply aren't enough of them, they're running around like mad between customers, and the establishment simply doesn't have enough of them. It's not like they're hurting for business, so the owners\management could easily afford another employee or two to lighten the load. That said, please be kind to your server, if you watch around the establishment, you'll see them working like crazy to keep everyone satisfied. My hats are off to them. The dessert is what makes this place so well known, and they do call it The Cheesecake Factory for a reason, you'll never be disappointed with it. And they have quite a variety, too. I'm giving this three stars, and I'd like to remind everyone that it's not a bad rating. Yelp consideres three stars to be ""A-OK."", and that's what this place is, it's okay. Personally there are a lot of less crowded places that I'd rather be, but it's not an awful dining experience by any means. Whether you're a San Diego native, or a visitor, you are somewhat rather obligated to try this place at least once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1180

Sarah C.,"Evanston, IL",28,151,11,2.0,10/26/2008,"Alright, I know, normally I wouldn't review a chain restaurant, but I thought I'd drop a line because of my particular experience with this one. On a Friday night, the CF gets crazy busy, right?  Right.  But we were told around 7pm that the wait would be 15-30 mins.  Totally manageable normally, but I was dining with a diabetic friend who definitely needed to eat in that time frame.  I asked him if that wait was alright and it was, but when it turned into over 45 minutes...that was another story altogether. At the 45 minute mark, I spoke to the hostess about the situation and she seemed not to care at all that our wait time had gone way over, claiming that they weren't able to get us into a four-top for another 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, other people who had gotten there after us had already been seated.  Only once I mentioned the diabetic in the group did she begrudgingly seat us.  No apologies for the wait, no smiling, nothing.  Luckily, we had an amazing server who mostly made up for it...it wasn't her fault they were out of like three things on the menu that people in my party of four wanted.  The food as always was good, huge portions and basic choices-- though I'm still unsure why their menu is 22 pages long. Overall, just skip it.  Go to dinner at a real restaurant and grab some to-go cheesecake on your way home.  You'll enjoy the cheesecake a lot more when you're sitting on your couch watching TV. Also--  just something I noticed in San Diego.  Can we all stop pretending that Cheesecake Factory is some fancy joint that requires dressy clothes?  I fear for San Diego if this is the pinnacle of a good date night experience...it's a glorified Friday's or Macaroni Grill.  We saw far too many people who were dressed up like it was friggin' Homecoming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1180

I'm not the type to complain at restaurants but the service was SO bad after we came in for my mom and brothers birthdays that I had to speak with the manager. We told our server when we first arrived that we were there celebrating 2 birthdays which she ignored, the service was ridiculously slow even though the restaurant was less than half full. We had to flag down various servers and busboys to take our order, refill drinks, provide our check and run the check. 4 of the 5 meals came out together and we were asked if we wanted to have our food delivered as is, without the sauce so that we could all eat together... Uhh, seriously??! Did I order the dish without sauce? No. So why would I do that because you are incapable of having everything ready at the same time? Such a weird experience and a disappointing birthday for the family. I went to see a manager after the meal and was again let down by how dismissive he was, stating that the food did not come out at the same time because of kitchen issues. Again, why are your kitchen issues my issue? Please do something to rectify the situation like let your customers know ahead of time and comp an appetizer or something!

Cookie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,157,5,4.0,8/24/2012,"I typically don't like chains but you have to acknowledge when they do it right.  This place is consistent - no matter which restaurant you go to in the country, every dish is always prepared exactly the same, is excellent quality, the service is prompt and friendly (although some locations do get very busy but we go later at night so it isn't a problem) and their portion sizes are the same (usually very large for most dishes).  Their menu is HUGE.  My boyfriend ALWAYS gets the Chicken Maderia which the chicken breast cooked to perfection, the rich sauce with the mushrooms and cheese is perfection and the asparagus are slightly crunchy with nice mashed potatoes with the skins.  I can see why he has difficulty trying anything different.   Me on the other hand?  I love to experiment and, so far, love everything I have gotten here.  This time I got two items off of their SkinnyLicious Menu.  The ahi tuna tartar was amazing.  $7???  Seriously?  I have paid twice that for something half as good!  It was a divine serving (about 1 cup size) in the middle of 4 asian crackers.  It consisted of exquisitely tender small pieces of raw tuna mixed with avocado and a soy-ginger sesame sauce.  OMG, that dish could make me never want to try anything else again (and in fact, I have gotten this the last 2 times!).  I also got the Lettuce Wraps Asian Style.  These are very different than what you get at other location.  They come out in the metal holders standing up like they are tacos.  They are FULL of a wonderful blend of fresh vegetables like carrots, cucumber, bean sprouts,  rice noodles a sprinkling of cilantro and drizzled with a spicy peanut sauce.  They were so fresh and flavorful, you didn't need either of the 2 sauces that cames with it (one was a chili sauce and I can't remember the other one).  This dish was also very tasty.

Melissa H.,"Renton, WA",59,72,30,2.0,1/4/2010,"The parking, or lack thereof, put a bad taste in my mouth to begin with. We finally found a parking space so small that everyone had to get out before we pulled in just to get in - about 1/2 hour after we arrived. Luckily we got there when we did because when we left there was a line out the door. I can only imagine the nightmare for those people who not only had to find a parking spot but then had to wait for an hour to be seated. (Which I refuse to do anywhere.) We walked in to the cavernous, beautiful restaurant. This place has really high ceilings, wrought iron, marble and brass fixtures giving  the impression that we're in for a classier dining experience. However once sat down, it's really run like all the other corporate chains out there with that machine-like churning out customers as quickly and with as little service as possible. We went with my parents, visiting from NYC for Christmas, to celebrate my mother's birthday. We chose it because, during Christmas week, it was the only place we could find a birthday cake for her.  I had Steak Diane, ordered medium. It came out brown on the outside and raw inside. I sent it back requesting a whole new plate as i hate reheated beef. The waiter looked at me like I was from another planet. My father cut into his pork chops, they were also raw. Raw pork can make a person very, very ill. We sent that back. My father was so turned off by the sight that he went without dinner.  The waiter was very unapologetic, which prompted me to call over the manager. I mean, 2 out of 4 dishes were raw and my father's drink had hardly any alcohol in it as well. The manager was pretty much equally as unapologetic. He offered to replace the meals but that was it. I would expect some kind of comp on the bill, especially since they knew it was a birthday celebration. No such luck.  A restaurant that tries to pull itself off as a upscale bistro type place needs to treat its customers as if its a bistro type place. It was not intimate, friendly nor was the food out of the kitchen good (even once it was cooked), or even edible . And the place is LOUD. VERY LOUD. I give this joint one star for decor. It gets one more star for the incredible Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. It must have weighed 50 lbs and we paid 50 bucks for it. As far as I'm concerned, The Cheesecake factory has no restaurant. It's a bakery worthy only of my visit for coffee and desert. My theory that restaurants with menu's as huge and varied as this place's are not capable of turning out high quality.

Daniel A.,"San Diego, CA",31,15,,1.0,8/14/2015,"I've been eating at the Fashion Valley Cheesecake Factory for years. The food, service, and selection have always been first class. Not anymore. My last three visits were memorable experiences because the food was awful, the service horrible, and overall, I walked out the door feeling totally unsatisfied. And just for the record, the various people who joined me for lunch or dinner agreed with my assessment; each had encountered substandard service and unsavory food. Considering how pricey their menu is, the food and service should be superb. I won't bore you with the nitty-gritty details, but I had ordered the chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, and bacon. First of all, I don't know how they have the nerve to call this a chicken sandwich when 90% of the sandwich consists of bread, lettuce and tomatoes. The microscopic chicken on this sandwich was about a half inch thick, so overcooked that it was as tough as biting into a dog's rawhide chew, and it had no flavor whatsoever. After two bites, I called the waitress over, told her why I was very unhappy with my sandwich, so she took it away, asked me if I wanted something else, and surprisingly, deducted it from the bill. I spoke to the manager afterwards in a very polite and calm manner and explained my experience. He, of course, couldn't apologize enough. However, he tried to justify the situation because he had only been manager at that location for a few weeks and ""There were many issues he needed to address."" Well, that may be the case.

We thought they might just have a pinch hitting, bench warmer, chef filling in on an off night, but it might be more about quality control and branch management because despite needing to send back two of the four dishes they didnt comp anything and then the bathroom was so dirty it looked like a gas station. We try to be sports and not send things back but had to send two things back, yikes. The waiter and manager were decent about it but not the kind of ok you would want after having to send back most of what you ordered.  On the positive side, the Margarita and fried macaroni appetizer were the normal good you expect from this solid chain. This wouldnt make me never go back to a Cheesecake factory just last time at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1120
Zach G.,"Hemet, CA",47,16,4,2.0,8/19/2012,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, generally. This experience left a lot to be desired. They were fairly busy, for a Tuesday evening, but, we were seated quickly. Our server, Angela, greeted us, and took our order, then we sat there, for more than half an hour waiting for our food without a word from our server. All the tables around us got their food relatively quickly. By the time we got our food we were really to leave. My wife's steak was under cooked, and my daughter's pizza was thin, and cardboard like. My salad was good, but the chicken lacked any seasoning.

Foster B.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,2/6/2013,"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge CF fan. Their restaurants typically have wonderful food and ambiance for group gatherings. Which is why I wanted to bring a group to the one in San Diego. We were attending a conference nearby and I was hosting a late night gathering. I called 1.5 months ahead to find out how to reserve a room since they state, ""We can serve groups up to 40.""  They asked me to call back 2 weeks before the event since ""We don't take reservations."" Reasonable request. I did so and that time they asked me to call back a few days before the event because, ""We don't take reservations."" Again - reasonable request. I did so ... again.... and they said that bringing a group of 15-20 at around 9:30 pm wouldn't be a problem and ""We don't take reservations.""  When we arrived at 9:30, we encountered a mildly irritated staff. When I tried to explain that I called ahead to alert them so make sure they wouldn't be put out by a large late-night group, I heard one more time... ""We don't take reservations."" (They must cover that point thoroughly in the Cheesecake Training School.) The food was mediocre and the service was okay. What was suppose to be a celebratory gathering was dampened by the sense we were unwelcome business. All this to say, if you're planning a large group gathering at this Cheesecake Factory, do so with... reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1120

Good that we ordered only one entree and shared it else it would have been very filling. For dessert we had the Hersheys Cheese Cake which was awesome!  The price was not too high compared to the big portions they give. The waitress at our table was very good and smiling the full time and was very friendly! The service was very good.

Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing.  He waived the corkage on the bottle of merlot that we brought and comped us on the java.  We appreciated that too!  My only knock on the place is the noise level which is in the middle decibel range but all in all a good experience.  Not my first time at any Cheesecake Factory so I guess I'm a fan.  For the uninitiated, be prepared to wait at the peak dinner hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1200

No, actually it was awesome.  I would label this eatery ""vegetarian friendly"" because although they don't have too many veggie options, the options that they do have are delicious.  For a place named after a dessert food, Cheesecake Factory has pretty amazing main courses.

Our server brought me a strawberry lemonade, when my husband said to her ""she ordered a regular"", she replied ""Oh that's my mistake ugh"" and walked away pretty upset, she brings back a regular lemonade in the same glass she had used for the strawberry lemonade. I could tell due to the strawberry seeds and debris floating around in the glass. When we were ready to order she seems as of she did not want to take our order. After taking our order we waited almost an hour when I noticed the table behind us who had been sat about ten minutes after us had received their food and bill before we even received out food.

Jennifer J.,"San Diego, CA",309,118,6,5.0,9/16/2008,"Honestly, The Cheesecake Factory is one of my top five favorite restaurants and has held this prestigious honor since it opened up at The Fashion Valley mall. Here is my top 10 list as to why The Factory deserves the honor: 10. The menu is huge. If you can't find something that you utterly enjoy on it, go back to McDonald's. 9. The wait staff is always accommodating. You can substitute things and it will still come out the exact way you asked, on the first try. ( I have a picky mother-in-law and there are ALWAYS substitutions when she orders her meals) 8. If you are lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar and want to eat there, they set you up right with all serving utensils and place mat. Plus, you get your drinks faster, score! 7. Outside seating. We live in SD, sitting outside is a must! Especially those of us that are chained to a desk most of the day. 6. Plenty of tables. When a restaurant is as popular as this one, they need lots of tables and The Cheesecake factory has plenty. I have yet to wait over an hour for a seat, even on a holiday weekend. 5. Artichoke Dip. This is my favorite appetizer ever and the Factory does it well. Spinach, artichokes, cheese=Heaven. 4. Avocado Egg rolls. Really, I have no need to say more. 3. Cheesecakes! In every flavor imaginable. And they all rule! They even have sugar-free ones for those of us that can't have sugar. Yes! 2. Blue-cheese stuffed olive martinis! These little morsels rock and The Factory hand-stuffs them. Mmm... 1. And Finally, Miso Salmon. I can't even find the words as to how great this dish is. The fish, the sauce, it is so freakin' good. I have been to the restaurant when they were all out of it (it has to marinade over night and they only make a certain amount) and I think I cried. Thank goodness there are so many other delicious dishes but the Miso Salmon, just might be my request for a last meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1200

I can kill for good chocolate, and, therefore, always end up with the Godiva or Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake. As for the food, it is also good. Steak Diane, Pasta Da Vinci, Ahi Tuna are the ones I get. Oh, yes, and the fired calamari if you are just having drinks here. The plates are huge, the service is outstanding (only one time in 5 years I had to ask for a manager), chocolate cheesecakes are...there is no word to describe this piece of heaven... 1600 calories in one piece! Anyway, that is the spot for whatever needs - business lunch, night cup of coffee, dinner with your friends/family. Can not go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1160

Eric S.,"San Diego, CA",2,1,1,2.0,7/4/2010,"First, I had the Kobe Burger, which was good with the grilled onions and mushrooms but seemed a little small for its price. I had french fries with the meal which were about average, and the beverage of choice was root beer which was way to flat but that may have been because there was way to much ice added. The cheesecake, for which the factory is named after, seemed a little overrated. I have had better Cheesecake from other restaurant in the San Diego area. But my wife did love the Red Velvet Cheesecake! As for the service, the waiter that helped us was very knowledgeable about the specials and attended to us very well, service didn't go out the door until our original waiter went on break and the new waitress came on in relief. She forgot to bring me a refill on my root beer, When I asked for water she brought it in a dirty glass and she seemed to be rushing us out the door. We just received our desserts and she was asking me if I needed change for my receipt at the same time.  It seemed as if she was thinking, this is not my tip so I am not going all out! Hopefully she doesn't get any part of the tip I left for the first waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1160
Paul L.,"Brooklyn, NY",113,48,,4.0,10/28/2008,"A few weeks ago a good friend of mine invited me to join her for dinner at the Cheesecake factory. I have to admit I was bit judgemental and apprehensive in her restaurant selection. Its not that I don't like the restaurant per say but its the things that I normally associate with this restaurant.      -For one, the wait on weekend evenings is similar to a wait to go on Space Mountain on a Saturday. At least an hour and a half minimum.    -Secondly, I usually come here with my mom and dad(its my mom's favorite restaurant) where they are in the habit of giving me the, ""you should be doing this financially"" lecture.     -Thirdly, the place is always the recipients of douchbaggery, big parties of 17 year-old rich snobby girls spending their daddies cash, and fanny pack wearing tourists.      -Lastly, the servers in this place remind me of Willy Wonka's umpa lumpas. These people all look the same in those funky white outfits and there are tons of them everywhere. Its like they have one server per table. Its amusing to see them all constantly bumping into eachother all night.    But I did give in to my self-indulgence and gave the Cheesecake factory a shot. Of course when we got in the restaurant there was absolutely no room in the lobby so we decided to sneak in the bar and steal two seats. It was perfect because the Dodger/Cub elimination game was on the tv and our bartender happened to be from Chicago.           The bartender's service was quick, friendly and attentive. This impressed me because his team was about to get swept by the Dodgers. The cheesecake menu selection is a bit overwhelming because there is so many choices. I got the 4 cheese pasta dish which had mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, fonrtina, on a bed of rigotoni pasta. The sauce was a light marinara /basil sauce. After my dish, me and my friend shared this huge strawberry shortcake that was well worth the splurged stomach after.   Sitting at the bar was overall nice because we got to drink and eat without being distracted by 60 umpa lumpa servers running around and fat tourists with their fanny packs. The food and service was great but one star gets knocked off because of the high food prices. If I was a rich douche, I'd probably be here more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1160
Abaigeal P.,"Millington, TN",1,13,,1.0,8/25/2012,"Normally, I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to 5 or 6 around the country and this one is by far the worst. Today is my boyfriend's birthday and we wanted to stay home but have a restaurant meal. I ordered it to go; it took me 20 minutes to get there and I waited an extra 25 to get my food (as did the other two cars next to me). My boyfriend ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles, which are supposed to come with succotash and mashed potatoes. They didn't give us the mashed potatoes. I ordered the Orange Chicken, and I would have rather had Panda Express. The only chrunch that should come from eating fried chicken should be bread crumbs, not chicken parts.  The last time we ordered curbside to go, my boyfriend waited 35 minutes for the food. After two bad experiences, I won't be back.

Laurel T.,"San Diego, CA",519,307,16,2.0,12/19/2008,"I do not know what the hype is about this place. Is it because their menu is so huge it takes a year to read? Or is it because you feel like you are in some Las Vegas type restaurant while you are dining?  Now perhaps the first problem was that my amiga  chose this place as her birthday dinner destination during one of San Diego's very few rainy weeks. I live off Texas street and it literally took me 45 minutes to navigate through the blocked off flooded roads and into the mall parking structure.  Also, who dines in a mall restaurant this close to Christmas time? I for one make all attempts to completely avoid the mall at this time of year.  So there I was, starving, soaking and in need of a frosty bevie. I greeted my gaggle and we cruised over to the bar to partake in some pre-dinner libations. Birthday girl had been given one of those pager things and we were told our wait would be between 15 and 40 minutes. Now that is a huge window of time but a drink in my hands and all kinds of mindless high school gossip to catch up on and I am good to go.  Three Stella Artois and 55 minutes later, we were seated. We placed our drink orders and waited what seemed like forever to get more drinks. There were a few mix-ups, a Merlot was brought instead of a Cabernet, one of the mai tais seemed to be lacking booze etc. etc etc.  We were nearly fighting over the last pieces of yummy bread when our drink order waitress came over and introduced another waitress to us and informed that she would be taking over for the remainder of our dining experience. Okaayyyyyyyyy, whatever can we just ORDER ALREADY???  We ordered, birthday girl went for the avocado egg rolls which were fresh and delicious. I ordered calamari that was served without any lemon and took forever to get a wedge. My princess went for a chicken ceasar which was sub-par, his princess ordered a club sandwich that was soggy and falling apart. Other tablemates ordered the chicken potstickers which were good and served with a gingery sauce and someone ordered a bang bang chicken plate. It looked odd.  The food was not that good, The bill was fairly large and birthday girl didn't even get a complimentary slice of cheesecake, she got a small half champagne flute filled with some type of cream and chocolate disaster.  This whole dining experience was awful, it took forever, the food and service was not good!

I mainly ordered their appetizers because they were to die for and they filled you up very quickly. I had stuffed mushrooms and tex mex tacos. My friends ordered some pasta, which sat in your stomach very nicely. My friends also ordered cappucinos which were beautifully decorated and served to us. The Godiva Cheesecake was very rich.  I think the only complaint people would have about this place is that there is a long wait, but its only because a lot of people like or go to the Cheesecake Factory.

In about 15 minutes, drinks and bread rolls were served and the entree was served about 20 minutes after we ordered; the desert was served more quickly. Our server did a swell job and was very polite, though she came to our table one time too many. We ordered ""lunch portions"" pasta and they were slightly-large-one-person servings.

Mac from Predator E.,"San Diego, CA",1,23,1,4.0,6/23/2009,"I gotta write a review even though no one will read it since there are already over 100 of them. I usually hate chain restaurants. They're too corporate for me and the food is most always lacking and overpriced. However, one of my exceptions is this place. The food is quite good. In fact, while some items taste better than others, I've never actually had a ""bad"" meal here. This sounds crazy, but they have the single best cheeseburger I've ever eaten. I'm serious! It blows anything else that I've had out of the water. It's the classic burger with cheese. The meat is flavorful and juicy and the patty is gigantic. It has a grilled onion, tomato lettuce and comes with a garlic mayo that is delicious. I don't know how they do it, but it's so worth it if you're a fan of a good burger. The service at this place is probably hit or miss, but I've never had any problems really.   One thing that sucks is sitting on the patio when the heat lamps are on. In between bites of food all you can taste is propain since the lamps are blasting at full power. But, depending on what kind of life you live, this could be a great thing since you can eat a meal and get high at the same time, free of charge.

Joelle R.,"San Diego, CA",362,317,63,3.0,11/2/2008,"If I could give 3.5 stars I would. The service and food was about a 3.5 - 4, but the place itself was more like a 3.  I won't go as far as to say ""I'm a fan"", but it was definitely ""A-OK"", so 3 stars it is! If you've ever eaten breakfast at a hotel in Vegas, that's what the ambiance at the Cheesecake Factory is like.  Immediately upon sitting down, I told my friend, ""This feels like a hotel restaurant... doesn't it?  Don't you feel like you're at the Doubletree or something?""  When I looked around at the high ceilings and decor of faux marble columns, Egyptian faces and cobras-as-candlesticks, I realized it was like brunch at the Luxor. Also, the advertisements in the 16 page menu were so cheesy, I might as well have been in Vegas.  Seriously? Right next to the omelettes was a big full-page ad for  .  Page before that? Some joint in the mall.  And so on and so on and so on.  Very tacky, in my opinion.   The staff was pretty attentive. Our server was friendly and brought everything we wanted in a timely manner. He even slung us some extra bacon because they accidentally brought us 2 sides instead of one.  Their coffee was good and the eggs benedict I ordered was perfectly cooked.  (After I chased down the waiter to tell him to ask the chef to make my yolks 'done'. A runny yolk wounds my soul.)  The hollandaise wasn't the best I've ever had in my whole life, but it was a good execution with a hint of dijon.  Good stuff!  My friend's California Omelette was delicious, too. The layers of garlic and shallot and the big firm steak-cut mushrooms they used were excellent. Would I eat here again? Sure, if someone was having a birthday or particularly wanted to go here. Like i said, the food was solid and the staff attentive. But with so many wonderful restaurants in this city, I don't know that I'd go out of my way to eat at a fairly homogenized chain like this.   Bottom line, the food is solid, but if I wanted to eat under a Sphinx face, I'd go to the Luxor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1160

At first I thought I was going to be under-dressed in a faded Hot Water Music jacket and jeans that somehow are still held together, but to my surprise, no one turned to stare at me as I had expected. There is a nice mix of looking nice and just ""coming in off the street"" here when it comes to how people dress which is always good. Places that don't have a balance I do not appreciate.  The service was really good and the pre-meal basket of bread they bring out is to die for :) Unlimited ""refills"" :) Score! Oh, and the coffee was AMAZING! Due to the fact I was short on cash, I went with their basic salad, which was alright, nothing too fancy but it could have been a little ""crunchier"" and the ""side of ranch"" they brought out was a joke considering the salad to dressing ratio was waaaaaaaaaay off. This frustrated me.  The wall of cheesecake in the bakery display cases was enough to make any sweet-lover go into sugary heaven. Oh it looked good!  I defiantly will come back here again.

That being said, the only really great thing I can say about the Cheesecake Factory is their desserts are fantastic and their cocktails (the strawberry martini and the pommegranite mojito) quite delightful. That's what gave the review the third star instead of just two. This particular restaurant is always super crowded that the wait is about an hour unless you want to wrestle someone for a table at the bar. I wouldn't mind waiting if the food was better. Trying to stay on the healthy side, I ordered the portabello sandwich with a side of spinach instead of fries. The spinach was DRENCHED in oil and the sandwich was super greasy. Sadness. I have definitely experienced better food cheaper.  What really did not make me happy was our server. Very nice girl. However, when it came time for our check, my friend put in a $20 and I was going to put the rest on my card. The receipt came back with the entire bill on my card. I call the server over to inquire and her claim was that there was no $20. We, for the life of us, could not figure out what happened to a $20 that was so clearly inserted into the checkbook in the 10 feet between our table and the register. We searched around but it was not to be found (you can make your own conclusions) and we weren't about to pay another $20. She was nice enough to re-charge my card the appropriate amount but it took two weeks and a phone call before the original bill was taken off the card (my card was double-charged).

So after a few minutes the manager(Josh) came out and i respectfully told him that we have been waiting for more than an hour, thus, after checking into the matter he came back and said the people just got their check and they should leave soon and there is nothing a can do. Really Josh????? there is nothing you can do! how about a sincere apology and taking care of your customer who dropped $285.33  I have no idea if their upper management is checking on these managers who will run down their business.

The only time I had a bad experience (they burned steak or whatever), they replace the item, apologized and comp'd the whole meal for myself and guests (without being asked).

Carolyn S.,"Carlsbad, CA",982,401,10,3.0,1/3/2008,For what it is....upper end cafe....about the ilk of TGIF...but a bit nicer. Three stars. Here's my reasoning: The Cheesecake Factory is a hit for Fashion Valley...but the set up architecturally causes women and girls to exit the restroom into a rather quick moving and blind walkway...a walkway waiters are often taking at break neck speed. A collision with a hot coffee pot...just waiting to happen. The menu has good variety...but they would do well to offer a couple of healthier alternatives.  The entry way floor can sometimes be slick...it's tile...sometimes wet tile. Another accident in the making. The wait can be an hour or even more. Service...hmmmmm....I have yet to be impressed. The place comes across to me as too corporate and just too cold. This one is lacking the oceany elegance of the one in Santa Monica.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1240

Mike D.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,53,33,1.0,5/29/2008,"Went on May 18th. Service was slow and had to wait for our food because our waitress went on break, so the new one probably forgot about us. After the meal, I got my bill  $60.61.  Service was far from good, so I left a tip of $7.39 (about 12%) to make a total of $68.00. Checked my credit card statement today and saw that my new total was $72.61. This was not a pending charge, it has posted.  I guess she was upset with the 12% tip and just added $12.00 (20%). I am calling the manager tomorrow to get this straight. Good thing I still have my receipt.  I will edit this post with the outcome... Here is the outcome: Went back in and the manager gave me an excuse that they must have entered the wrong tip for the wrong bill. But then he said that the original transaction was voided and then reentered. He offered me a free burger. I said no thanks. Got a refund foir the over charged portion.

Rishi D.,"San Diego, CA",26,62,,1.0,9/24/2007,"Allow me to give you my history at this place and overall experiences before I dive into my story.  I've been to the Cheesecake factory in Palm Springs, Charlotte NC and a couple times in Fashion Valley.  While the breakfast is nothing to write home about (as SD has numerous outstanding breakfast joints), I've had the pleasure in indulge in their lunches (not too bad) and dinners (okay).  The only saving grace would be the cheesecakes and customer service or so I thought. This past Friday on Sept. 21st, me and a group of 3 walked in around 9:45-10PM after seeing a movie just to get a drink and a quick bite to eat from the appetizers. I didn't want to burden the kitchen knowing it was near closing time so I thought this would be easy and quick.  Apparently this is where the trouble began.   I ordered the Fried Salmon Rolls, someone else ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with Caesar salad, and the other couple ordered a spirit water.   Our waiter came by twice, then disappeared.  OVER ONE HOUR LATER (we looked at hour watches 11:10PM) we decided to flag down another waiter and ask what the hold up was on our food.  Apparently there was a transition change and they dropped the ball. They informed me that our food was never put in.  I told them I was ready to walk and forget it.  The delightful manager on hand, Joey, informed us everything would be taken care of.  So we waited..... Lo and behold our food arrived.  Amazingly they screwed up this too! The Grilled Cheese sandwich was halfway done, with some of the cheese not even melting through.  The Caesar salad was soggy and my fried salmon was tepid at best (I developed a stomach ache over the weekend from it).  We ordered them to fix the sandwich, which came back soggy and not even cooked well. After the second time, I said forget it.  HOW DO YOU MESS UP A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH?!?!? A 6 yr-old can make one better than what they offered.  Someone must have been smoking back there for sure.  It's bad enough to be forgotten, but messing up the order twice more just made it worse. Another manager came out and apologized profusely (Tom). The only redeeming quality was the free cheesecakes given to us.   Salvaged a little bit of an otherwise horrendous experience.  I can't really recommend this place to anyone who waits for over an hour to eat here.  I have to agree with some other reviewers in that the food is overrated.   I may be a pescatarian, so I can't comment on the chicken and beef plates. But if they can mess up their grill cheese, salads, and fish dishes how can I give it a higher rating for their other items? If I go again it will be with hesitation.  I never reviewed a restaurant this low, but this really needed to be yelped!  Spend money elsewhere unless you want cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1260

Here's a list of CF pros and cons: Pros:  +It's massive and loud, so if you're stuck on an awkward date or with a group of boring people, it will seem less awkward.  BTW, I just realized how awkward the word awkward looks.   +You get a nice chunky transponder dongle so you can go shopping while you wait for your table.  (one of the hostesses told me it only works directly outside of the restaurant, but I think she's either stupid or lying, 'cause its worked for me farther away) +The bread is decent and generously portioned +Lots and lots of cheesecake +Cheesecakes come with enormous blasts of whipped cream, which is way too much to eat.  It's actually more useful for flinging at people when you're bored by the people around you.  Trust me on this. +The heat lamps outside are seriously intense. Cons:  -It's massive and loud.  Hard to hear conversations and find the bathroom. -The entrance and most of the restaurant is usually crammed with people waiting for tables.  Hard to get through and hard to admire all the cheesecakes. -Service is flaky.  Some of the servers are really nice and hilarious, while others treat their customers like they are five and can't hear what you are ordering. -Long wait times that are often inaccurate.  I had my birthday here with 5 friends, and we were quoted for 2 hours.  We ended up getting a table after 30 minutes.  Another time, I was with a group of 8 and the wait time was 30-45 minutes, and we ended up waiting over an hour. -Random ads in the menu (why would anyone want to advertise pants in a restaurant menu?) make it even longer and harder to read through.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1260

Pros:   - Extensive menu: they have everything from Mexican to Asian to traditional American.  There's something for everyone, which is great 'cause my sister loves standard American fare, I love spicy food, and my mom live seafood.              - Great drink list              - Great desserts, of course!

If it only served cheesecake I would give this restaurant a 5-star rating, but the other stuff it offers isn't that good.  For example, I had their chicken marsala and it was only average.  I have had better chicken marsala at family restaurants (sad I know).   But you have to keep in mind that it is a chain restaurant.  Their alcohol options are fairly good, but I think they water it down because I oculdn't taste the alchol in the pomegrante martini or the Typhoon Punch, and II definitely didn't feel it.  As far as the service you can expect much the same as other restaurants such as chile's, applebee's etc.   The ambiance here isn't anything too special but it's nice on the inside and out.  Although, it is not very clean and rumor has this palce has  C rating from the health department right now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1220

I'm not too sure what it was we were being rewarded for, but I'm not in the business to question anyone willing to buy all of us an enormous lunch. We got there around 11:15am and there was no wait at all. We got seated fast and our drink orders were supplied quickly. Not very hard when everyone orders Coke, but it was still pretty impressive to have three waitresses place twelve full glasses on our table in five seconds. Sam ordered us two of the Appetizer Sampler plates... Insane. There's like five different appetizers on each plate. After trying one of each, I was pretty much ready to call it quits.  I had the Chicken Avocado Club... Delicious. It was slices of grilled sourdough bread stuffed with Swiss cheese, grilled chicken breast, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and an herb mayo. Along side the huge club was a generous portion of french fries. They reminded me of the kind you get from McDonald's, only not horrible.  I ate the whole sandwich and most of the fries. I started to get super full, and in desperate need of a nap. Ape, I really could've used an Ambien AD!  =) I didn't have room for cheesecake, but I've had it before and it's really good.

Emma N.,"San Diego, CA",0,54,,1.0,10/31/2011,"I usually love The Cheesecake Factory because the entrees are huge and delicious and I'm a huge fan of the Kahlua Cheesecake, but at this location I've NEVER had a good experience with the service. The second worst experience I've had with this location was when I went for my mother's birthday dinner. At the end of our meal when the server was trying to clear our plates, he spilled the sauce from one of the dishes onto my father's lap. Mind you, this is a dark brown sauce from a steak. The server says, ""I'm usually better."" Seriously? Couldn't you at least apologize? And then he comes back with a napkin and a club soda so that my father can wash it off. He doesn't call a manager, and when we look at the bill, there was no comp whatsoever. At least apologize! SO RUDE. My last experience was the worst. I don't think there was a single thing that was done correctly. I'm usually not a complainer because I've been working in the restaurant industry myself for at least 5 years now, but I've never seen a situation as bad as mine was. When we get there: My mother, brother, and I went to the Sunday brunch thing they have going on for a nice family meal, and as soon as we get there we order 3 waters for drinks to start. As soon as I get my water, my brother and I notice things floating around in our waters. Mine had leafy green things and his had a brown blob in it. Disgusting. We didn't say anything to the server though. He seems flustered so we just let our waters sit there. Entrees: We're ready to order our entrees with our menus closed and everything and we looked straight at our server. He takes the order of a few tables that were seated after us, closes out the table next to us, and then comes back to grab our order. Well ok, I can take that with a grain of salt, sometimes servers can be a little off. We ordered a few simple things: the monte cristo sandwich, the classic burger, the giant belgian waffle, and a side order of sweet potato fries. That order should not have taken 35 minutes to get to our table. Tables that were seated after us and that had their orders taken after us had gotten their food before us. Not only did it take 35 minutes to get to our table, it was not fresh-out-of-the-kitchen hot, it was a sitting-under-a-heat-lamp hot. My mother's monte cristo sandwich turned out fine, but my brother's burger was ordered medium, but when he bit into it, it was so WELL-DONE that it was just dry. My giant belgium waffle was served plain with only the syrup and not with the fresh strawberries and chantilly cream as stated in the menu. Later on, I realized I was grateful they didn't served my waffle with fresh strawberries for the reason stated in the ""Drinks"" section next. Drinks: We ordered the drinks and entrees at the same time, but I will put this in a separate section for special reasons. My mother ordered a simple hot coffee, my brother ordered a soda, and I ordered the Strawberry Smoothie. The coffee still had coffee grounds in, visible when you mix in the cream and sugar and stirred, so we had to ask for a new one. My brother's soda was never refilled. My strawberry smoothie had a pineapple slice and giant fresh strawberry on the rim. Pretty! But after a few sips of drinking the smoothie while eating my meal, I noticed mold on the strawberry. MOLD. I sure hope they used pre-frozen strawberries to make my smoothie instead of using fresh strawberries and blending it with ice. Horrifying. Afterwards: We were having such a horrible experience, that we decided to just pack up our leftovers, skip dessert, and head out. It was ridiculous the amount of problems we had at our meal. I'm usually very forgiving when it comes to these sorts of things, but it was just one problem after the other. The manager was apologetic and told us our meal was paid for which was so absolutely generous of him, but when the server brought our togo boxes and a bag, he placed a check on the table and ended up charging us for my brother's soda. Umm ... what? That seems a little petty don't you think? Still, we were grateful for the manager taking care of our lunch so we paid the $3.18 for the soda and left. The absolute worst experiences I've ever had with restaurants I have had here. You have most certainly lost a customer in me.

Our waitress was on top of it!  So glad we had her.  It actually worked out perfectly because we were supposed to be waiting for a table but then a bar table opened up so we swooped it and sat there instead. We each had two Well Mannered Martinis.  They're basically dirty vodka martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives (my favorite!).  The bread they brought to our table was fresh and tasted great.  We shared an appetizer this time around as well.  We ordered their Southern Crispy Chicken Sliders (not sure what they're really called on the menu but this is what they were).  And they tasted great!  There were four total and they were served with lettuce, tomato, and pickles on the side along with regular mayonnaise and a spicy chipotle sauce.  I'm actually a fan of the Southern Style Chicken Sandwich at McDonald's so this, to me, tasted twenty times better!  They're new on the menu too so keep an eye out for them. Now if you've never been to the Cheesecake Factory before, keep in mind, they don't accept reservations and the wait can be ridiculous.  I recommend going at an odd hour (around 3:00 or 4:00 pm) with a friend for quick service and delicious food!  As for their prices, well... they're not low.  Things will add up quickly here so if you're on a budget... beware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1300

Matt R.,"Orange County, CA",20,419,238,1.0,11/10/2010,"The King of all Chain restaurants. Still B.L.A.H. How the heck does a place like this get so much play? There is nothing on the entire menu that's either creative or unique. Service is very bad. It's one of the most unhealthy places on the planet. They are pricey and the location sucks. Not only that, their menu is 18 pages long! I think they just went to every chain restaurant and added every item to their menu. Imagine Denny's, Chili's, Olive Garden, BJs, CPK, Red Robin, Marie Calendars, Islands, etc., all rolled into one restaurant that sells cheesecake and has decided to make it their namesake. Their menu is mostly pastas, burgers, sandwiches, pizza and fish. Everything tastes like everything at any chain restaurant in the entire country, SALT. Their portions are huge, but lack true flavor or creativity. Another place that sells chicken and pasta? Boring. If you don't believe me that this is one the most unhealthy places in the entire country, do your research. Yahoo! runs daily stories about the 'most unhealthy food' in America, be it burger, pasta, chicken, faux healthy, you name it: Cheesecake Factory ALWAYS makes the list and usually is #1 most unhealthy. If I'm going to eat something unhealthy, it needs to at least be more creative and flavorful than something that came out of a Denny's kitchen. I would much rather spend the same amount of money at Claim Jumpers, where there's at least better quality and larger portions. $20 for the entree items I named is unreasonable, when they lack any quality. The location of this place sucks. Anyone that has ever been down Friar's Rd, Fashion Valley or San Diego; knows that this area is a nightmare to navigate. There is no view in the restaurant. One side is the mall, the parking garage, the parking lot and Friar's Rd. The service is absolutely awful. The entire staff consists of dudes, empty headed boobarellas and d-bags. It's like the restaurant in Office Space, without the flair. Every single person I interacted with tried to be hip, witty and cool. It would not have shocked me to see someone snap like The Fonz and go 'aaaaayyy!' It was so cheeseball and corny. Thank God I wasn't with anyone I was trying to impress, or I would have been completely embarrassed. Putting a tool in a shirt and neck tie does not make them any less of a tool. Go away, frat boy! I'd rather have someone who looks miserable in their job, as a server, than someone pretending that eating at this place is 'cool.'  What kills me, is that this place was packed. Guess it goes to show that advertising, corporations and gluttony are the cornerstones of American society. You'll only have yourself to thank, when your neighborhood bistro or cafe goes out of business and we're all stuck living off a steady diet of over salted, chain restaurant food. You can buy a jar of their ranch dressing for an absurd price at their front counter, if you really want to take home that corporate America feeling and show off to your friends at Fashion Valley that money is no object to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1300

I believe everyone was satisfied with their meals, and I'm pretty sure none of us got the same thing. I had the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane, which was outstanding.  I loved those mashed potatoes.  I've had similar just about everywhere that includes the skin; just the way I like it.  I also had their soup of the day.  I opted for a cup instead of a bowl, because it's huge, and not much smaller than the bowl.  It was great.  I believe it was a Creamy Chicken and Artichoke Heart soup.  3 of us got it, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We lapped it up quick, that's for sure. For my drink I chose a glass of water...and a Mojito.  I got the regular one, as I believe that's how you properly compare Mojitos at different places.  This one was great.  I really can't say anything bad about it at all.  It was minty, sweet, ever so slightly sour from the lime juice.  And it even came with a sprig of mint and a slice of lime.  I may just have to sample their other flavors of Mojitos. I sampled the steamed Edamame, which was actually quite good, and a huge portion, so be prepared to share. When it came to the desserts, the selection is huge, and we all got different cheesecakes. Everyone loved their choices.  We got, the Tiramisu cheesecake, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, the new Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake, I had the Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake, and someone else got something else.  I wish I could remember which one they got.  I'd have to say that I will definitely go back, even if only for the cheesecake. My decision to go back for the cheesecake only is mostly a result of the prices.  Most meals are between $10 and $20, and for most people, a take home option is best.  I spent just over $50 for myself, including a mandatory 18% gratuity for a party of 7. I hate mandatory gratuities, especially when the service sucks, but I was not disappointed at the service at all, so it's okay this time.  18% does seem a bit high, though, as I believe tips are anything extra you want to lay down in thanks.  I think I should be left to decide how much extra of my money goes to you.  After all, you get paid a regular paycheck as well; why are my tips counted as expected income? Sorry about the rant; I just had to put it out there. Someone had mentioned on here about the slippery floors.  It's very true.  My shoes are non-slip, and for some reason, I still felt that I had to be extra careful while walking through the restaurant.  -1 star for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1300

The buffalo boneless chicken or whatever was delicious, and I also enjoyed my Louisiana Chicken Pasta.

Michael D.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",6,4,,1.0,5/10/2013,"I'm only giving it a one because I can't give it a zero. Where to begin? We went here for my mother-in-law's birthday. Despite informing the staff of the event, no action was taken to make the night special. My sister's plate was grabbed by another waitress, forcing her to wait another 10 minutes while they cooked her another. Despite talking to the manager about the mistake, no actions were taken to make the situation better. We were promised a free slice of cheesecake to make up for it, but it never came. We had a party of seven and despite advertising that they can accommodate parties up to 40, we were stuck at a booth that seated 6 and simply placed a chair at the end of the table in the pathway for our other member to sit in. The waiter we had was quite snooty with us, and did not pay very much attention to our requests. One such instance was the splitting of the checks. He had to come back to us to re-split it twice. A mandatory gratuity charge of 18% is automatically added to the check for parties of six or larger, which seemed a little unusual considering most restaurants force gratuity with parties of eight or more. Most of our party paid with their bank cards while I chose to pay in cash. We never received our receipt, nor the change from our payment, which was very unsettling for myself and my wife considering that the tip had already been taken out of the check. No receipt and they stole our change on top of that. It was only a few cents, but still, it was stealing.

The little foil butters actually had teeth marks in them....gross. My tomato basil pasta noodles were literally swimming in oil, and my friends pasta was dry, and crusty, like it had been sitting out. Immediately after it was served we told the waiter about the pasta, and  he said ""you just need to mix it up more"". NO. the pasta was dry and crusty like it had been sitting out for HOURS. Then the manager came over and apologized. He offered to bring a new one, but at that time The rest of our group was more than 1/2 way done with our meal.

Poor girl.    Well, needless to say, the food was good.  Maybe I should give them another star, because I will go back.  I love the cheese cake, and I know the right items to order.  I also know how a restaurant works, and maybe next time I will request a table in the front of the restaurant where the more experienced servers are working. Not many people know this, but the newer and less experienced servers always work in the back and move their way up the chain of command.  LoL.   Our food took a really really really long time to come out.  So long that I wouldn't be surprised if our order didn't go into until 10 or 15 minutes after we ordered it. Our drinks came out wrong.  We were ignored the entire time we ate. The tables surrounding us were covered in dirty dishes and plates. Booh Hooh Cheesecake Factory.  This was my first time eating at this location.   I enjoyed myself at the San Francisco location, so maybe the next time I eat here I will have better luck.   I wish servers weren't a matter of luck, but with all things there are good and bad.  I know as a server I have my days, so maybe I should lay off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1280

When we finally were able to place an order, it took over 40 minutes to receive our meals. My pasta dish came out  first but my husbands (burger and fries) was no where to be seen.

We took out of town visitors there on Friday evening and the service was absolutely horrible. First we waited a long time for service, which is understandable on a busy Friday Easter weekend night, but then when we did get service it went from bad to worse.  We were seated outside, so it was evidently a long walk from the kitchen so getting all 7 of us our meals took a while. Then the water dropped the container of catsup which splashed on one of our visitor's very expensive swede shoes as well as on 2 other's shirts. Of course he apologized and gave our guest a wet paper towel to clean off his shoe. A wet paper towel and an I'm sorry. It didn't get any better after that. The same guest asked for mustard for his burger and waiting almost 10 minutes for it!  If this were in almost any other place I have been, a manager would have come to the table to offer his/her apology and done something to compensate for the accident. But here, nothing. My guest did even say something to that effect to the waiter, but the waiter just responded with "" I did apologize and it was an accident."" I was even more embarrassed by that. During dinner, there were at least 2 more spills of things - one was a tray of candles crashing to ground, and I don't even know what the other was. The staff moved things around to clean up the glass and then left one of the portable heaters so close to my chair that I all but fell when I got up to leave. There was no concern for or even awareness of the comfort and safety of their patrons. Needless to say I left a terrible, insulting, tip (and I am normally a very generous tipper), but I'm sure the waiter didn't think he did anything to deserve the insult and likely only thinks I am cheap.

Their small plate of crab and artichoke dip is very good too. It has the right amount of crab in it and goes well with the buttered bread they serve it with. The only thing is that it was a little too oily for me. Their factory nachos are HUGE...but good. It comes with guac which i love, sour cream, salsa, and jalapenos. I'm not really a nacho person but theirs was pretty good. Their mashed potatoes are a different story. If they don't come with the plate I want to order, I always order a side of them.

For anyone who plans on making party reservations, please read this first. We were set on coming here for our friend's 21st birthday dinner. The day before the event, we called to reserve a space for our 20 guests, but were told, by the hostess herself, that reservations could only be made the day of and starting 30 minutes after the restaurant opened. So, as per their instructions, we called the following day, maybe 40 minutes after it opened?  And what  were we met with? The host, a different one this time, tells us that reservations can only be made WITHIN 30 minutes of opening. We informed him that it was THEIR staff who told us otherwise, but they refused to make the reservation, and told us instead to have someone show up 1 hour before our dinner so they can save the space. Can someone explain to me why they prefer a 1 hour notice over the SEVEN that we were giving them by calling? The summary of the explanation he gave afterwards was that you can't make reservations for the nighttime because those are their busy hours. I understand that this place gets very packed, but that was the point of our reservation. Their website says ""we can accommodate parties of up to 40 people"", but they've made me feel like I have to work everything around them.

A variety of all different types of foods from salads, burgers, pastas, to steaks, seafood, and tacos. They have it all! And after a delicious meal, save room for a piece of cheesecake! You will not be disappointed - my favorites are the red velvet cheesecake and the 30th anniversary (not too chocolaty, in my opinion). I've never been disappointed here, and also the complimentary bread and butter is delish - keep it comin! LOL. Mid-ranged priced but definitely worth every penny.

Christopher J.,"Glendale, CA",207,253,299,4.0,4/26/2011,"==The Cheesecake Factory== Hmmm. I know the location is near the mall so parking is always an issue, but this side of the mall there is never any parking in their tiny little private lot near the place. You'll end up driving up and up on the parking structure next to the factory. So don't expect to find parking right up near the place. Ambiance is nice, yet very loud. Low lighting and very spacious inside. They also have nice outdoor seating areas which is pretty relaxing on a fine San Diego day. The cake slices are way overpriced, but the portions of the actual food are HUGE. You can feed two people with one dish. I'm so serious. Very good helpings for the price that you pay. This place gets pretty crowded around dinner time so, there might be a 15-30 min wait  for parties larger than two.  ==The Food== I ordered the chicken tenders and boy were they tender! Make sure you get a dipping sauce. I believe it comes with two different sauces and it comes with fries too. I also had a Caesar Salad which was very fresh and cold. Even the plate was cold. How it should be. I was craving a cappuchino too so I got one of those and it was actually pretty tasty. Although, I wish they would add a hard candy stick as a stirrer like most french places do :)  -_- The Breakdown -_- PROS:: 1] Very huge portions on the dishes 2] Great ambiance and very spacious 3] The food is good American Quality CONS:: 1] Expensive cake slices 2] Parking is a nightmare",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1040

Jared G.,"San Diego, CA",40,169,7,5.0,3/29/2011,"I know giving 5 stars to a massive chain restaurant like cheesecake factory might make people question the integrity of my rating system but after much thought i just had to give this place 5 stars. Ill try and justify why i would give 5 stars and YES this is the only mass chain restaurant i would give 5 stars too. For me coming here satisfies everything i look for in a restaurant- Nice decor, Great customer service, clean facility and bathrooms, a dish i never get sick of (chicken madeira), and a dessert that is amazing! So based on all that i have to give it 5 stars becasue i always leave feeling satisfied. i have been to a cheesecake factory over 50+ times in my life and on every single occassion except 2.... i have ordered the chicken madeira. This dish is amazing. Its tenderized breaded chicken breast covered in madeira mushroom sauce with asaparagus and cheese topping it off. Served with a side of Mashed potatoes my mouth is salivating just thinking about it. I have recommended this dish to several people and have an overwhelmingly positive response to those who have taken my advice. 2 times ordered a different meal to try and venture out and explore the menu and both times in the end i was kicking myself for not getting the chicken madeira. Cheesecake is my favorite dessert so im sure that helps me further justify my 5 star rating. I recommened the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. I have tried the red velvet cake cheesecake which is part cake and part cheesecake and it is really delicious. However the red velvet cake cheesecake weighs in at 1500+ calories.... so keep that in mind all you gym rats and calorie counters. The white chocolate raspberry is a little more user friendly at around 700-800? i cant remember exactly. Still a lot but atleast you can split the cheescake because chances are your stomach is full from all the food. The portion sizes are huge and sometimes i even pass on dessert because i just couldnt fit it in my stomach.

Kaylee H.,"San Diego, CA",21,188,41,3.0,8/8/2012,"Cuz and I went to the CF for lunch today as kind of a special ""lunch before she has a baby and her life is over"" kind of thing.  The last gasp, as it were. I have to preface my review by saying that I really do not like Fashion Valley.  The stores are overpriced, the people working in said stores and snotty beotches, and there is NO PARKING.  The only time I venture to this devil's den is to go to PF Chang's and The Container Store.  My love of PF Chang's trumps any issues I have with this Faux Beverly Hills Mall.  As does my love of organization.  But I've never had trouble finding parking when going to PF Chang's or The Container Store, because they're on the fringe of the madness I guess. So after driving up and down and up and down the aisles of the parking structure (silly me, I thought we'd be able to park in the covered lot so the car wasn't hot as the surface of the sun when we returned), I threw in the towel and parked on the top deck, in the sun.  Should've brought a brisket and left it on the front seat, I wouldn't have had to cook dinner tonight. We walk over to CF.  And let me just add here that, the architects of the parking structure (on the north side of the mall along Friars) didn't take into account that people might want to walk from the structure to the restaurant, and not directly into the mall.  To get to the restaurant (or PF Chang's or The Container Store) one has to walk across the busy street and walk a bit and then cross again to the other side when the sidewalk finally begins, or risk one's life by walking in the street.  And hey, even though it's a small street inside the mall parking, people drive like it's Indy for crissakes.  And it's exacerbated by the valet parking doods who figure it's worth risking their lives and the lives of men, women, and children to get a good tip.  Whatever. We enter CF and it is packed.  Here's what I am thinking:  Don't these people work???  Surely they can't all be spoiled unemployed wives like Cuz and I.  Happily though we were seated very quickly.  Unhappily, the tables are thisclosetogether.  If you're into privacy (and being able to actually hear your meal-mate), forget this place.  The reason I give this place three stars is for their ""Skinnylicious Menu.""  I LOVE IT.  I love eating at restaurants that go the extra mile for the odd duck who wants to eat healthy (me).  The menu is long and has lots of yummy, and relatively low caloric, appetizers, entrees, and even cocktails.  Gotta love that!  I had the Skinnylicious Pear and Endive Salad, with Grilled Chicken, Endive, Radicchio, Arugula, Butter Lettuce, Roasted Pear, Blue Cheese, Candied Pecans and Tomato Served with a Low-Cal Vinaigrette.  It could've used some larger pecans but I know they're trying to stay under a certain calorie count.  Cuz had Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos.  We both had iced tea which was very refreshing on this stinkin hot day in August. The waiter brought us some bread and here's where points are deducted from the initial five-stars:  Bread that is not warm, with cold hard butter.  What am I supposed to do with that?  This country doesn't know enough about how wonderful bread is when it's hot and the butter is smooth because if they did there would be rioting in the streets to correct the injustice and shame of cold bread/frozen butter.  Either warm the bread, or serve whipped butter.  Come on people. Waiter was fine, not great, just fine.  Service was not speedy but not an unusually long wait. Bottom line:  I would return to eat at CF if they had locations other than this mall, but the mall, the parking, and the wait all add up to:  Probably won't return to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1040

Rachel R.,"Cupertino, CA",13,103,,3.0,4/7/2006,"Walking up to this place is knowing that you're in for a long wait.  By the time you fight through the gaggle of mall-goers, teenie-boppers, and tourists looking for something ""San Diegan"" (no clue how CF is authentic, but maybe they're from Moscow), you finally put your name in and the wait is always more than 45mins.  The pager you get is treated like a pregnant lady ready to pop.  Luckily this place has a bar and bar tables just in case you get impatient and can't wait for a real table...that is if you can get one.  Point is, this place is packed...all the time.   After a drink or two and a look-see at the cheesecake bakery window eying your dessert, the pager goes off and you are whisked away to your table.  The menu is gi-normous and can be easily mistaken for a magazine with all the dumb adds it has.  ""Ooh, this pasta dish looks good"", ""what page are you on?"", ""Its the one where the woman is lying on the leopard pattern sofa"", ""Ah, found it..."". Yah, I am not so sure how necessary it is to have these adds on their menu, but what the hell do I know about running a franchise.  I must say, everything I have had there was satisfying.  Haven't tried everything, I don't have the budget or patience to wait.  The salads are so large they are impossible to finish, who can eat that much lettuce, I don't have 4 stomachs.  But, I do have an extra stomach for dessert.  If you are calling yourself Cheesecake Factory, you have to live up to the namesake.  I've had some orgasmic desserts, the kinds you don't want to share, but you have to because you don't want to come off as a greedy pig...no one likes that.    Going with a small group is cool, they have large booths for everyone.  And they have good bread that I love to fill up on before my meal has arrived.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1380

Libby J.,"Tempe, AZ",2,30,,2.0,5/31/2008,Took a quick late lunch break while on business in the area. Served by four different people and the only interaction I had with my actual server was when she stopped by three minutes after I had been served my entree to ask if I was still working on my plate. Of course I am still working on my plate....the lettuce on my salad wasn't even disturbed from its original formation. Ordered a Vodka martini that was on the menu. Came with Gin.F Would have told someone about it if anyone checked in with me other than to ask if they could take my plate while I was still eating. Remarkably bad service for a place that was not even busy. Eugh. Would've been better off at Nordstrom Cafe.

Mel C.,"San Diego, CA",136,622,,4.0,1/8/2009,"Came in for a late lunch around 2pm and didn't have to wait more than 3 minutes to be seated. The servers seemed friendly, but a little slow even when there weren't that many people dining. The interior of the restaurant reminded me of PF Changs for some reason- maybe the huge pillars and high ceilings? The menu is huge and it was difficult to narrow the choices down. I got the lunch portion of the Miso Salmon and Mike got the Tons of Fun burger. We were wondering why it was called that, but soon figured it out- it really was tons of fun watching him try to fit that huge burger into his mouth. The presentation of the food was great and the portions were big for lunch. My salmon was surprisingly sweet- almost like they injected it w/ honey. I wasn't a fan of the sea of miso sauce (which was pretty much butter) that bathed the rice. The rice was dry and not too appealing, but the warm bread made up for it. Mike's burger was good also, but the fries were too salty. We ordered a chocolate mousse cheesecake and were a little overwhelmed by all that rich chocolate- good thing there was so much whipped cream to go w/ it. Food coma didn't hit until we got up to leave, but if you walk it off at Fashion Valley mall, you'll be fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-diego?start=1400

I don't really favorite chain restaurants and I've tried to find things I didn't like about cheesecake factory but i just couldn't. I like everything about the cheesecake factory. It's the best place to have a meal after a long day of shopping. I love their new snack menu, they are just perfect. Their fried zucchini is the best and their ahi tuna! My bf loves the firecracker salmon rolls, we wish there were more per order. Their thai lettuce wraps are good with a fully loaded plate. Love how they have a  big selection of pastas. My favorite is the farfalle and my bf's fav is the Louisiana. I also love the chicken and biscuits and the cajun chicken littles. These items are all like comfort food to me. What's better than to end the meal with their famous cheesecakes? I love their oreo cheesecake, mainly because I love oreos and their cheesecake isn't overly sweet so it's just perfect. The only thing i think i actually don't like are their sandwiches. I've tried two before and they both failed me so I refuse to try anymore. Other than that I love this place.

We were expecting to have a nice dinner but then with a heat lamp out, cold soup, and a spacey un-attentive waiter we were left dissapointed. The bar was great we enjoyed a nice drink and the appetizers were amazing as well (tuna tartar). But after that everything went downhill, my friend and I both work in customer service environments where we always put the customer first. And when someone who is supposed to serve a customer makes a mistake... the least you can do is apologize and try to make it right. However, at cheescake factory, fashion valley, we had a manager apologize, a food-runner apologize, but the actual person who was our waiter acted in-sincerely and un- accomidating. It seemed as though everyone else was trying to make the situation right, but him. It showed and we left unhappy.

And most of the time we don't even have room for it, but the hope of saving that room between the 5lbs of food per serving and looking at the clock realizing you lost 3 hours of your life, and maybe, just maybe you'll have the cajones to order a decadent little slice of cream cheesey heaven makes it all worth while.  I seem to always get the chicken n biscuit dinner (no peas or the food will be swimming in them) and Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Both are a-ma-zing and will satisfy my hunger for like two days. Only one time did I get french toast and it happen to make about 40 minutes to arrive.  By then I was too cranky to enjoy it, but otherwise I've not heard of a bad dish there, ever. I will note a couple simple things in a restaurant I value and that this place lacks, spreadable butter and regular ice tea-the passion fruit is a little funky.  But, here's a tip- stick the butters under the bread right when they come, and you'll be golden.
