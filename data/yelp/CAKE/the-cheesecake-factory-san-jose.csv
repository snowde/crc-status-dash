Richard P.,"San Jose, CA",124,7,4,5.0,1/1/2018,"I took advantage of the two free slices w/$25 egift card last week which tends to take place at the end of every year. It's new years so I assumed the wait would be long (was told 45 minutes when we arrived).  Decided to swing by the bar and luckily there were two empty seats. We were greeted by Julius and another bartender, both were very friendly and tended to us for all of our needs throughout our stay.  Ordered some finger foods from the light menu and a few drinks. Received some warm bread while we waited. Everything arrived in a timely manner and was very delicious. Had no issues using the egift card and free slice codes. Both pieces arrived very quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose
Jasmine P.,"San Jose, CA",174,103,382,3.0,12/21/2017,"The wait is about half an hour for an evening dinner on a weekday. It's not so bad since the restaurant is in a mall. They have a lot of seats for you to wait at or you can do a little shopping while waiting. After we got seated, it took a long time for the server to come by and take our orders. It also took quite a while for the food to come out. You get some bread and butter to eat while waiting for the food. The warm crab and artichoke dip was a good appetizer. It was very warm and gooey. Absolutely wonderful with the warm toasted bread that was served with it. The avocado eggrolls are a bit different, but the flavors worked out very well. The dipping sauce that came with it was also ice and tangy. The fish tacos were decent. I thought it was a bit dry. The tacos came with some beans and rice on the side. I've never really liked the ambiance of the Cheesecake Factory. Something about their lighting. It's just terrible lighting that just makes everything so dark and dingy looking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose
Shannen R.,"San Jose, CA",266,394,225,4.0,12/20/2017,"Oh the New Found Glory! No, not the rock band, the new cheesecake glory! Waited only 10 minutes on a busy Saturday afternoon to be seated - woo! Their Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake was delicious. It was flavorful, soft, and cheesy. I could pass on the whip but my S/O likes it. Their bacon cheese breadsticks are amazing. There was a tasty crunch to each bite. There was lots of bacon and lots of cheese, enough said. I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory but hated the long wait times.

Lauren Ashley G.,"San Jose, CA",496,294,1800,4.0,1/13/2018,"Love Cheesecake Factory but I hate the long waits. Usually in the earlier evenings they aren't too too bad and in this case they weren't! It literally was a 10 minute wait and we got lucky and found front parking. We sit in a dimly lighted table. I'm talking so dark I needed to use my cell phone light to read the menu. Food was decent as always so that's great. Cheesecake was phenomenal of course. The thing that also stinks is that it's at the mall which most Cheesecake factories are, and I usually try and avoid the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose
Christine H.,"San Jose, CA",68,304,1338,5.0,12/12/2017,"I have been to other Cheesecake Factories before, but this was actually my first time visiting the Oakridge location.  I stopped by here with my fam for a birthday celebration, and I really enjoyed the dine-in experience. We came in and were seated about 20 minutes later. We were paired up with Ashley (who was an excellent waitress by the way), and the rest of the night went well. 1) The bread and butter here are delicious and addicting (don't eat too much though because you might not have room for the actual entree). 2) We got all the correct orders, and our food arrived in a timely manner (20~25 min) for five dishes? 3) The Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta was...super good! It WAS expensive (like the rest of the dinner items here), but the portion was HUGE (probably enough for two or three meals, depending on your appetite).  4) Free birthday sundae for the birthday person? Great! It was actually good (but too much whip cream in proportion to the ice cream/fudge). A few down-sides: too dark (I know they're going for the whole dim thing, but it was hard to see even the face of a person across from us...then again, as long as you can see the people next to you, it's ALL GOOD-more intimate and private)+a little noisy (but what can you do? It's a huge restaurant?!)+crowded waiting area (There's already enough seating for around 12 people in the front, but the amount of people waiting seemed to be close to double that amount). All in all, the experience we had was great! Props to Ashley for her service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose

Amy T.,"San Francisco, CA",77,87,153,2.0,11/16/2017,"Came here on a Saturday night, it was packed.  Initially, I accidentally parked in one of the ""Cheesecake factory"" spots in the parking lot right in front of the valet area. It was too dark to see the first time, but good thing I double checked because in small black lettering underneath ""Cheesecake factory"" it says the limit is 10 minutes and this is a spot designated for picking up orders only. Don't make the same mistake as me! The wait was about 30-40 minutes, after I reparked my car, my party has already been seated so I started walking towards the back to the booths to find them. I guess I almost walked into the kitchen area because I was stopped abruptly by one of the staff working there. He was very assertive and pushy and asked me to go back to the front desk to be escorted to find my party.  I noticed the food at Cheesecake factory tends to be pretty much the same everywhere but the service can make a big difference. I know this is a very busy restaurant chain but the wait time between each time the wait staff came back to check on us was way too long. And we can tell because we were there for 1.5 hours and half of that time was just waiting for him to come back. Each time he approached our table, he was already getting ready to leave.  3.5 for the food, 1.5 stars for the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose

UPDATE: the bartender I mentioned before was cool like I said but however I visited today and the new staff was unprofessional and weren't able to do there job. I asked for a table in the bar when I got there and they said no there's someone before you waiting for it, I said ok. 20 minutes went by and they still never filled the table. I told the hostess and she smiled and didn't say anything to me. She then went and found another set of people to finnaly and filled the table.

Nik R.,"San Jose, CA",103,8,4,1.0,11/18/2017,"It should be a ZERO rating. Worst service possible. We put in our food order right when we sat down and it's taken over an hour to get our dinners. They said that there was a long list of pastas in queue but the tables around us got their pastas and they have only been waiting 10-15 minutes. The manager came by and was no help. He made excuses and didn't say much. I understand restaurants get busy and orders take long but tickets shouldn't take 60+ minutes. I've worked at busier restaurants and never taken more than 30 minutes.  There are better places to eat that have better service than this establishment. Don't waste your time and money on the Cheesecake Factory. Our bill was $88 for average pasta that didn't have any fresh basil and a cold bang bang chicken and shrimp. Really disappointed in the quality of food and service. Also, my cheesecake is missing some of the top layer.

Brenda L.,"Syracuse, NY",970,1932,3488,4.0,12/14/2017,"I remember being in high school when this place first opened. There were always long waits and it was the fancier of meals my family would have. It was always a special occasion if you were dining at Cheesecake Factory (after all, there were table clothes and the waiters wore button up shirts with ties and slacks). My favorite meals here were the chicken madeira and chicken marsala. Dad would get some kind of steak dish and mom might get a pasta or fish. Can you believe the very 1st Cheesecake Factory was open in 1978? I had no idea this chain was around for that long. I came here for National Cheesecake day once because they had a buy one get one half off cheesecake deal. The menu here is huge and portions are large. Their plates are usually good enough for 2 people. I often want to finish my own plate but the calorie content in these dishes are high. The interior reminds me of an Egyptian-esque Vegas hotel casino lobby. It is dim with vaulted ceilings and an unidentifiable style.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose
Melissa N.,"San Jose, CA",16,123,275,5.0,6/27/2017,"Regardless if the service is a hit or miss (this time was a miss, although I'm writing this review after the fact, so I forgot his name) the food is still really good. Every time I crave food from there, it always comes out cooked well and full of flavor.  For appetizers we ordered: calamari and chicken pot stickers. For entrees, we ordered: steak Diane and herb crusted salmon (factory combo) along with chicken Bellagio. The appetizers are always a hit, especially the calamari. The pot stickers were soaked in this really strong ginger sauce, and we didn't really like it. It was too over powering and just not to our liking. Next time we order that (and we will), we will mention, light on the sauce. Our entrees were made to order, especially my steak Diane. Medium cooked. Perfect We also had some adult beverages, blood orange mojito and typhoon punch, or something like that. Both were tasteful. I feel like the only draw back is that the lighting in the restaurant is so dark. I'm not really sure what kind of ambiance they're going for, but it's dark, for me. I don't really like that.

Danielle A.,"San Jose, CA",17,7,1,1.0,12/29/2017,"I wish I could give this restaurant ZERO stars, because I wasn't even able to be seated at a table properly. The hosts, who were not paying the slightest bit of attention to anyone, gave my table away to people that had not even been called yet. Just took them back, didn't ask for their name or anything, although I had just given the other host my pager. Then they proceeded to take two other parties to their seats, and then took others' names, until we said something. We had to explain to them what it was they did wrong, when they could not figure it out after giving them our name. The only response we then received was that it would be a moment while they got us another table. No apologies or anything, from any of the FIVE employees standing there. The no apology was a deal breaker for me, so I told them the table was no longer needed and left.

Astrid T.,"San Jose, CA",7,6,1,2.0,11/18/2017,"Such a well known chain where they seem to not care about good service but just about the money. We came in and while looking at the menu asked the front staff if they had nachos, we were told to go to the bakery and check because the guy ""didn't know the whole menu"". Unfortunately we decide to stay, the nachos were salty and greasy, not good quality but our bad for asking for such a dish in such restaurant... at the end we decided to take a cheesecake to go and Jesus (our bartender) asked us if we were ""going to order or not"" just because we were trying to decide which kind of cheesecake.

My husband had a procedure done early before coming here to eat lunch and was very hungry. He ordered off the GF menu and received a child's size pasta dish and was charged $16. When we asked about the portion the waiter Christopher O. Laughed and said to him,"" we only serve lunch portion now. I feel ya Bro I'm on a 4000 calorie diet"" and flexed his little muscle. Didn't offer to help the situation. He bring my dish and it's something I have never ordered ever. He makes a comment as he goes to order the correct dish, ""man it's too early""! Cones back 10 minutes later and brings yet a skinny pasta dish that's is on a menu on the table I never looked at. At this point I was done! I marched straight to the manager who didn't care and didn't believe me and didn't try and help.

The customer service was GREAT because my server Lisa was super sweet and attentive BUT the food was meh. I had the Goat Cheese and Beets salad and lunch sized Meat Loaf. The Goat Cheese and Beets was flavorful and delicious but the size was teeny for the price. The Meat Loaf with Mash Potatoes and Corn was not good at all. The meat was wayyyyy to salty and the potatoes were extremely cold. I was hoping my Reese's cheesecake would make up for it but it did not. The amount of sugar was deadly.

Had to wait 5 minutes to be seated even though there was plenty of space, which was fine. Service was friendly but EXTREMELY slow. Food was okay (nothing special) although the sundae was enormous and the chocolate sauce on the side was a nice touch. Happy also to see lunch portions service quite late into the afternoon. Wish I'd hit the restroom before ordering, though. I tend to judge restaurants by their restrooms. This one was absolutely disgusting. The restroom looked as if it hadn't been cleaned (or restocked) in days. Virtually every stall was filthy and the handicapped stall lacked toilet paper. I always wonder if a bathroom looks this filthy, what does their kitchen look like? It didn't help that all but one soap dispenser was empty. Hope the workers were able to wash their hands. This is clearly a poorly managed facility. I don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory often but I've historically associated it with a basic level of quality and service.

Scott B.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/22/2017,"This is the third time I have eaten at this restaurant and the last time I will eat at this restaurant. Tonight I decided to try their Old Fashioned Hamburger for a second time to see if they could do any better than the last time I ate at this location. Â They didn't. Â  On the previous visit, the hamburger was ordered with no pickles, no onions and no mayo and medium well done. Â The hamburger arrived with everything on it and the inside was basically raw! They sent it back two times and still couldn't get it right. Â At least that time they didn't charge me for the meal. Â Fast forward to this attempt: I ordered it the same way except at the waitresses recommendation I ordered it well done. Â Again it came with everything on it: I sent it back and all they did was remove the mayo, the pickles and onions and sent it back out. Â The burger had a overwhelming taste of pickles and was cooked as though it had been at ground zero in a nuclear bomb test! Â I thought of sending it back a second time, but having waited for the burger to arrive for over 45 minutes I decided to just take it home and feed it to my dog! Â He seemed to enjoy it! Â  My son ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich and found his meal to be lacking any real flavor or Parmesan cheese, he also said this is the last time he will eat there too!  Perhaps this restaurant should employ some cooks who actually read english( I was told most don't speak english or read english) so it's no wonder they can't get the order right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=120
Pat H.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA",11,1,,1.0,10/17/2017,"I have been ordering Cobb Salads at the CF for over 20 years, starting at the one in Beverly Hills. They are amazing, and always consistent.....the same every time. The wait for food at the CF on Blossom Hill in San Jose was an eternity, even though the restaurant was the emptiest I have ever seen it (maybe THAT was the red flag I missed). The concoction that was presented as a Cobb Salad, while technically a Cobb Salad, did not remotely resemble what they usually present. The Cobb from CF is always pre tossed, with all the ingredients mixed in, a ring of riced egg around the edge, lots of succulent chicken, and thick crispy bacon throughout. The one yesterday had the ingredients sectioned on the top, bacon bits, very little dressing drizzled on the top (it was very dry, and I had to ask for more). The salad wasn't bad enough to send back, but it was not their usual, and was the same as ordering a hamburger and getting a hot dog. I would never have ordered this if i had only known what I was getting.  The bottom line is that after all of these years, I don't know if I can ever go back. Consistency is key in a restaurant, and I never want this to happen again............and the only way I can think to avoid it is to avoid the Cheescake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=120

It was our guests first time, and this is our favorite spot so we were excited to treat them. We were seated in the bar area and at first our service was great. Our server took our drink order and we placed an order for buffalo blasts and avocado egg rolls to start. That's when everything fell apart... Our avocado egg rolls came out on time, but our waiter came back and said ""the Buffalo blasts needed some more tlc so they're gonna be a few more minutes"". 15 minutes later we are done with our avocado egg rolls, we placed our entree order, and managed to get several refills and still no blasts. Our waiter has been avoiding our table ever since. After several attempts to try and get his attention I finally caught him by the kitchen and asked again about the blasts. He says ""I'll check on them, it'll be just a few more minutes"".  At this point I asked for a manager. It took 20 minutes for Hana to come over, only to offer us some sorry explanation, and ultimately I managed to get her to admit that the Buffalo blasts were never prepped.  We finally received our blasts and entrees. Our server was still running around the bar area, socializing with all his tables, it'd be nice to have him check on us. Towards the end we decided we wanted dessert, there was no desert presentation. He assumed he wanted our cheesecake to go until we told him it was for here.

Elena N.,"San Francisco, CA",1407,2427,10573,3.0,12/14/2014,"I used to live in the suburbs, so I've gone to my fair share of chain restaurants. But living the last 8 years in SF has spoiled me. The last place I normally want to go is a chain restaurant. That being said, Â Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chains. They have a huge menu, so you can basically order whatever your heart desires. Plus, there's the cheesecake! *Mumm napa, brut prestige, napa valley, sparkling wine ($13 split) *Mini crabcakes ($13.50): served with mustard and tartar sauce *Avocado eggrolls ($10.95): avocado, tomato, red onion & cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper, with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce *Cajun jambalaya ($17.95): shrimp & chicken sauteed with onions, tomato and peppers in a spicy cajun sauce, over rice *Spicy chipotle chicken sandwich ($11.95): crispy coated chicken breast w/melted cheese & spicy buffalo on a brioche bun w/fries *Shrimp scampi & steak diane ($19.95): shrimp w/garlic, wine, basil, tomato; steak w/peppercorns, mushroom wine sauce; Salad *Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake: layers of rich brownie, kahlua cheesecake, creamy chocolate mousse and chocolate ganache *Peppermint bark cheesecake: white chocolate cheesecake w/chocolate peppermint bark, white chocolate mousse & chopped peppermint I went with the roommate's siblings, so there were 5 of us. Since he's been here so many times, he tends to order the same thing every time: avocado egg rolls, jambalaya and kahlua coffee cheesecake. All were good choices and he seemed to enjoy them. I however, can get overwhelmed by the huge menu and have no idea what to order. I ended up getting the mini crabcakes and the combination plate of shrimp scampi and steak diane. The crab cakes were good. The cakes could have been a little crisper from the sear since they were a little mushy. But it had a good amount of crab. The steak and shrimp were okay. The steak is served in three individual pieces, so if you like your meat rare, it will be over cooked. The shrimp were a good size and came in three as well. The sauce was a little too lemony for my tastes though. I did like the mixed green salad with their balsamic though. For me, the main reason to come here is the cheesecake. I ended up getting the peppermint cheesecake since it was seasonal and I do love peppermint! It was wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be which was good. And I loved the addition of the candy cane pieces on the whipped cream. I didn't care too much for the crust since it was too dense, but overall I enjoyed the slice. One of the drawbacks to Cheesecake Factory is they don't take reservations, so there's normally always a wait. I think we waited about 20-30 mins last Sunday around lunchtime. Not too bad compared to other locations I've been to. For a dining option at Oakridge, the Cheesecake Factory is one of the better ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=120

It's located inside Oakridge Mall so there's always shopping during the wait. The house bread is sourdough or brown and always comes out warm. The menu offers a skinnylicious option which seems healthier the. Most of the options they have. The chicken pasta from the skinnylicious menu was made of the noodle pasta that seemed kind of card board like and dry but it was ok. The skinnylicious salads are very good I like the Mexican one as it has a crispy taste with the tortilla chips and a good mixture of greens and corn too.

Even though we could see our table was ready with table ware n everything for the past 30 minutes (as we were waiting on the outside and asked for our table outside they didn't want to let us sit.

The person in the front kept saying 2hr wait and we won't know until another few minutes. We asked him to come outside and see from his eyes that the table is ready. But he said No to that. He just wanted us to wait and how dare we question him before our time. The table is set for 9 ppl outside for the past 30 minutes. It was our table. He was just very rude. We called the manager, Vincent, he made us sit there right away but no apology or anything. Finally sitting down. Ready to order. We wanted to order pasta for kids with a small change. Change white sauce to pesto sauce. Apparently that was too much for the kitchen to understand. We ordered the big plate in the end for them to share. Then we ordered Nachos without sour cream and add beans. But of course, it had sour cream and no beans. In addition to partly stale nacho chips. Asked for extra plates, they were dirty.

However tonight since my husband happened to be going to the mall I decided to call in ahead of time for our family of 8 and was placed on hold for 25 minutes, at about 10 minutes in I had begin to think that maybe they forgot I was on the line, but worried about losing my place in line and starting all over again I decided to be patient and wait it through, only to wait for a total of 25 minutes for them to pick up the phone and hang up on me!!! As you can imagine I was furious so I called back and asked to speak to the manager who ""happened"" to answer the phone & said his name was Vincent, I explained to him what had happened and asked him what the average wait time was, and if that was how they usually handle phone orders and his words to me were, ""Sorry that happened, we have 2 bakers taking orders & we can't exactly hang up on the orders coming in to take your order, I guess we could have gotten on the phone to tell you we are trying to get to you and to hold on, we are working on getting better."" Â Well I'm sorry if you have 2 bakers taking orders and so many orders coming in that a person has to wait on the phone for 25 minutes only to be hung up on, that sounds to me like there is nothing really being done here to help cheesecake truly working on things getting better. Maybe the bakers should be in the back baking, I'm pretty sure cheesecake makes enough money to hire additional people to answer phones so that people aren't having to wait on the phone only to be hung up on. On average my family has had dinner through cheesecake twice a month and this is just the final straw for me. As you can imaging it was already frustrating holding for so long but they were busy and I understood that, and secondly mistakes happen I also understand that but when you are a manger it is your job to diffuse bad situations even when you aren't the cause and I just feel that on top of everything that already went bad Vincent also could have handled the situation better and diffused it much better than he did. So though this review is explaining 1 particular incident it's the final straw that caused me to write this particular review and as far as their customer service goes cheesecakes gets 0 stars, and because of the way they treat people and their poor customer service skills I won't ever be ordering through door dash anymore either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=80
Sara H.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/4/2017,LOVEEEEEEE comign to this location. I always get way better service! Got my food lickity split! My go to spot. The waiter( didn't get his name) was outstanding,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=80
Julia H.,"San Jose, CA",85,148,327,3.0,4/8/2017,"The wait was typical for a Friday night, 30-45 minutes. The service was excellent, the waitress did everything she could within her means. The wait time for the food was about 35 minutes which I felt was pretty normal. My food, sadly needed to be returned. I ordered the vegeburger with French fries. The picture I took was before I attempted to eat my burger. As soon as I picked up my burger I felt the soggy bread, which I felt was because after the burger was made it just sat there. I was okay with this. The part that got me was when the patty broke into small pieces and fell out of my burger. It literally looked like I ordered a rice dish. Â I had to wait about 5 minutes before my waitress walked by, and I asked her if this was the norm. She said definitely not and offered to make me a new one. At this point by husband was half way done eating, so I felt that I couldn't wait another 30 minutes for my food. I ended up opting for something that requires no cooking. I ordered Cesar salad and clam chowder. The chowder was completely disappointing as it tasted like potato soup. The salad was yummy, but you can't really go wrong with Cesar salad.  All in all, it was a very average experience. My husband did enjoy his ribeye, and I loved the complimentary bread, and I did enjoy the egg roll appetizer! Yummy sauces! Also, the waitress did take the burger off our bill. Yet, we ended up paying for the salad and soup which I didn't feel like eating and was my only option because my husband had already started eating his meal. By the time my salad and soup came out my husband was done eating. I ended up taking the salad and soup home and is still sitting in the fridge as I am writing this review. Watching my husband eat isn't my ideal date night, and having to order on a whim anything that can be made quickly and having to pay for something I didn't want or eat, well it could have been a little better.  Still, I do like this place and I'll be back. Maybe at that time, I can update this review!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=80

John L.,"Salinas, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/27/2017,"Was in San Jose today (coming from Monterey County). I was in the mood for Chicken Costoletta and thought I would place a to-go order. Some guy picks up the phone, I told him what I wanted to do, and he said ""I'll transfer you over to the bakery and someone there will take your order. So I was put on hold and I waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Finally I hung up and decided to talk to the manager. When I called back, someone named Kelsey or Chelsea answered and identified herself as the manager. I told her that apparently, no one there is interested in picking up the phone to take orders. I suggested that she tell her staff to make sure that they make sure that someone is available when transferring calls. Don't eat at this restaurant.

Alazaya K.,"San Jose, CA",30,42,7,4.0,10/9/2016,"It's been so long since I've been to cheesecake so I decided to revisit it. To be honest, I last came here two years ago and the food was just ok for the pricing of the place. Yesterday I came around 7pm and waited for 25 min which wasn't too bad because it was super duper busy. My boyfriend and I were seated outside and our server was named Roger! He was great at helping me choose between items I wasn't sure on and was also content on checking up on us, making sure we enjoyed everything okay. I ordered the chicken Madira, 3/5 it was good, the dish came with asparagus, sautÃ©d mushroom, mashed red potatoes and also chicken with mozzarella cheese on top. Now for the chicken, they were moist... THOUGH they are very very thin pieces of chicken lol. It's like a chicken breast but they slice it horizontally into 4 long pieces and cut it up into half and only serve 2 pieces of chicken on the dish.  My boyfriend ordered the Cajun pasta, he says it's a 4/5 it was a big portion and had a good spice to it. I even noticed the chicken in his dish was bigger than mine ;( Anyways, we also got the strawberry slushee, 5/5 served in a really big cup! Enough to satisfy two people. It wasn't too sweet, tasted real fruit bits which was gooood. It also came with a big strawberry and orange slice as well :) Aaaand last is the stuffed mushrooms. Came with 6 big mushrooms in a cream sauce and cheese. Really good! 5/5. Our bill ended up being nearly $60 which wasn't bad at all!  Overall, this place is has good food. No complains ( aside the thin pieces of chicken ) it's very nice and elegant on the inside, they have a nice big bar which seems to be just as busy as the restaurant itself. They have a variety of different cheesecakes on display and they all look super delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=140

Debbie T.,"San Jose, CA",22,70,,1.0,11/12/2017,Usually I don't bother to write bad reviews because everyone has an off day once in a while but last night (sat 11/11 around 8pm) I went in to order 4 cheesecakes Togo. I expected a wait because they were busy. 15 min later I see the cheesecakes I ordered placed on the counter on plates. I figured they mistakenly made it for dine in instead of takeout. Everyone was busy so my boyfriend took the receipt to a bigger guy wearing glasses at the end of the counter. Without even checking he said no and waved us away. So back to waiting we went even though I was pretty sure another person did not order 3 white chocolate raspberry and one fresh strawberry.. a few minutes later we asked one of the cashiers and she went to check all the receipt and went to check the ones at the counter and turns out those were ours and plated by mistake. The guy that said no to us saw her taking the plates back and turned and walked away.. not even acknowledging he was wrong. He needs additional customer service training. It takes a certain level of lazy to not even take 2 steps to his left to check for us. 5 stars for everyone else who was working hard while that guy just stood there,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=140

It took them over 45 minutes to seat us. STRIKE 1! Our food came out all wrong. The cooks back there could not hit temps AT ALL. Two steak entrees came out Medium Rare instead of Medium Well. Aside from it being hard, the breading on the chicken sandwich was so burnt, it was almost black. On top of all this, they brought out everyone's entrees at different times. Why run food for a table of 6 before completing at least half of the ticket?! I am putting this all on the kitchen. STRIKE 2!  Sh*t happens, I get it. I spoke to John, the manager on duty. Instead of being apologetic, he was dismissive and defensive. He had the audacity to tell me that the chicken sandwich was perfectly fine because he checked the temperature himself. He would have had a valid argument if we complained about undercooked chicken, but the problem was with the texture, color, and presentation. His attitude was unacceptable, and I refuse to believe he was properly trained as a manager-- especially from a corporate restaurant chain. He definitely does not belong in the service industry.  We cancelled the chicken sandwich altogether. We sent back one of the steaks to be brought up to temp, and just packed them both to-go. 3 hours and $200 later, we left the restaurant irritated and still hungry. What did the manager John do? NOTHING. He offered no solution, but a slice of cheesecake on the house. Why would I want dessert when I did not even get to eat dinner??!!! No thanks. Keep your cheesecake, John. STRIKE 3!

Food came quickly and bread came out hot and fresh, they made new bathes just for us...  This menu has EVERYTHING! From Chinese to Mexican, pasta to hot soups... Is it authentic? No... But all the food is pretty good. ***garlic noodles: well rounded meal, with vegetables and strong garlic taste which I prefer lots of garlic. ***bbq pizza: it was okay ***chocolate milkshake: OMG, the best I've ever had!

We wait and they call out two more party of two that had checked in after us. We informed the front desk that we were waiting and that the people that were called came in after us, the front desk told us that we would be seated next. Two more party of 2 were called, we tell the front desk and they apologize and say that we would be next. It was already past 9:50 PM, we gave the pager and left.

Harini V.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/20/2017,"I usually don't review Â a place unless it's exceptional or really disappointing. Latter is the case now.This cheesecake factory location near valley Fair Mall , San Jose is unbelievable. I went on a Sunday night around 8pm and the wait was 30-50 mins which is acceptable, but even after my buzzer went on we were not seated saying 'it doesn't work that way ' ,why the hell did you give me that thing then.. well, after we were seated, for 20 mins! ,none of the servers cared to come, let alone take our orders. I really want to mention my order number which is 27 on the 19 th of March ,server was a tall well built man who couldn't understand what we were ordering and had to look at the menu which my guess should be a new recruit and who didn't care enough to bring us our water after waiting for 30 mins. Later we had to ask an Asian guy who was serving the next table for what's happened to the starter bread and water, he was like am not 'responsible for ur food n ur service okay!' and he was talking to me like am a freaking 3 year old Â and man don't I know servers take up alloted tables in a hotel , can't he be at least courteous enough to say 'ok, I will look for ur server Â and bring some water in the mean time'. After a gruesome wait we had to stop a man who was not our server AGAIN and ask to at least bring our drinks, he passed us 3 times after that without glancing . How can I blame him if 'my table's server' didn't even bother to show up after all our talk with the manager which was after 45 mins wait . The manager who was a lady was like u don't have to pay any bill , I didn't taste any damn thing in ur restaurant to take out my wallet.  The worst worst part of everything is we had a 2 year old with us and inspire of telling them we had to feed the baby, their response was 'there was some miscommunication and your table didn't show up in the list to be served'...

Laarnie B.,"Edenvale, San Jose, CA",0,4,2,1.0,6/8/2017,"I've been a loyal customer at this particular location and I've been coming here since it first opened. Today was the WORSE day I have ever experienced customer service, mainly with the front of the house host and manager. We came tonight to celebrate my nieces 8th grade graduation and from the look of it many other were celebrating their own. I made reservations at 5:18pm and the host ""Sasha"", if that is her real name and why doesn't anyone where name tags?. She told me an 1 and 1/2 wait for 7 people. I agreed and I gave her my number, she told me she will call me when our seats were ready. I came back in to check if maybe we got bumped in early, this was at 6:38pm. She then told me another 30 minutes. I said ""ok, we will wait"". As I stood there, Â I can hear her tell other customers 3-4 hours, then tell another group of people 15- 25 minutes. I should have known at that point that my family and I were going to get screwed. But I put it in good faith that in 30mintues our table will be ready.  We waited outside, it was getting crowded. At 6:56pm we came back in. I held my phone in my hands to see if they would call me on my phone and waited to see if they would call me out loud. Ay 7:06 pm my sister waited in line to asked the same host if we will be seated soon, since its been 1 1/2 hrs already. While my sister was waiting I can hear Sasah, tell certain customers 45mins wait and tell others 15minutes wait. I want to know HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? WHY WOULD A HOSTED JUST GIVE RANDOM TIMES OF WAIT?  By the time my sister got to her, she said we have no seats. I came in and told ""how is that possible, we have been waiting over the time she told us?"" She exclaimed "" we've tried calling you"" I told her ""My phone never went off"" with a ton of back and forth she continued to argue with me and then the manager stepped in. With no apology for the inconvenience, he proceeded to still blame me for their mishap. He read out loud my phone number, he begain with 89 and I stopped him, letting him know my first 3 digits were 507. All three, who were behind the counter, Sasha, the Manager and a man named Bernard, (How I got their name?.. I asked their co workers later that evening), still persisted to blame me for giving them the WRONG phone number. WHICH IN FACT WASN'T, because Sasha repeat my number to me as she punched it in. DON'T Lie! The manager still said till be a 30 minute and another man said we'll get you in in 15. Customer service tonight was RIDICULOUS!!! I feel bad for every customer tonight who got duped. We did stay. My niece set her heart out on having her Graduation Dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. I want to shout out to our server, Ileianna J and the other serves who helped her bust out our food and beverages. Shout out to the cooks and bussers, I know its a very busy night. As a person who has worked in the Hospitality Business for over 14 years, that was unprofessional and down right dirty. Some training and better time management for the host an over view on how to make the reservation system less flawed with help bring in more business. Telling people 3-4 hours for the next available table and others 15 - 20 minutes is money out the door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=200

Cindy C.,"San Mateo, CA",410,450,3439,3.0,1/19/2014,"My first attempt at this place was quite frustrating. I know happy hours are usually Mon-Fri but that is exactly why I called Saturday morning to make sure. A girl answered the phone and told me yes, they did have happy hour. My friend and I made the drive there and was told that in fact they do NOT have happy hour. I know it wasn't the hostess' fault because I don't know who I spoke with, but I let her know exactly how upset I was at being misinformed. The staff needs to get their information straight before answering customers' questions. My second attempt at coming for happy hour was much better. I called ahead again to make sure and was told it was Mon-Fri 4-6. It was a Friday evening and we came right at happy hour. You have the choice of either sitting at the bar, the tall tables, or a booth. My friend and I preferred the booth because it was a little bit cozier.  The menu was already on the table for us when we were seated. $5 drinks and appetizers during their happy hour which is a great deal. They had a few drink selections such as margarita, j.w.'s pink lemonade, mojito, and long island ice tea. I asked the waiter which drink was sweetest and he suggested the pink lemonade which I absolutely loved! My friend got the margarita, blended, and it was good but a bit salty for my taste. Their choices for appetizers are great. I ordered the road side sliders and the avocado eggrolls. I've had them before so I knew they were going to be great. The bun on the sliders were so soft and warm when they were brought out. The dipping sauce for the avocado eggrolls were definitely the highlight of the dish. For dessert I got my usual, the ultimate red velvet cheesecake! Who doesn't love cheesecake and red velvet?! It's heaven on a plate! Be warned that it is a rich piece of cake that you might want to share or it can be overwhelmingly sweet. Unfortunately I didn't catch the name of our waiter but he was fantastic! Took our order promptly, checked on us multiple times, brought us complimentary bread and butter, even made sure I liked my drink and was ready to bring me a second.

The bread here is delicious and the rest of the food was great, too. I love how our waitress kept coming over and refilling our waters. A+ right there! Fried calamari was pretty gummy, but in a good way. Good portions and it came with the standard red sauce and tartar sauce. I actually can still remember how yummy the nachos were, too. We got sour cream and guacamole on the side of course, since Tyler hates that stuff, but all around, the pico de gallo, cheese, jalapenos and chicken all were great on the chips. I think the reason why it was so delicious was because the chips tasted fresh. I tried looking for the name of what I ordered, but I couldn't find it. Huge portions though, I was the only one who couldn't finish my food. My boyfriend ordered the Smokehouse BBQ Burger and he devoured it in about 5 minutes, not going to lie.  My sister ordered a sandwich that had chipotle mayo in it. I'm guessing it's the Southwest Chicken Sandwich and her boyfriend ordered some pasta with chicken and red sauce. He finished his pretty fast too, so that's a sign that he enjoyed his dish, too. Sorry for not being too specific. Two appetizers and four plates, the bill came out to a little over $100.

Waiting to get acknowledged, waiting to get water... we never got refills, by the way. While our server was nice enough, it became obvious she was more interested in talking with her server friends instead of dealing with us. We'd look up during the meal and see her chatting with other servers at the register, even though we were waiting for water, waiting for our food to get boxed up, waiting for our check... it was infuriating. Not to mention I had wasted a $10 shopkick gift card on the meal. For those familiar with the program, you know how tough it is to get to the $10 mark. The upside: my food (pasta carbonara) was delicious as always, and our appetizer was great as well. My sister's eggplant parmesan was over-salted and was sent back, and her new entree of orange chicken was a new preparation that she didn't care for.  I sent an email to Cheesecake Factory the night of our meal and have yet to get a response.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=220

Â It can sometimes take up to an hour to get your food so be prepared to wait if you arrive during busy hours, however the food is always amazing and worth it. On the other hand, order to go and prepare to be disappointed. Â 50% of the time I order to go, my order is incorrect, cold, and normally missing at least one item.

Sharon S.,"Cupertino, CA",15,20,,1.0,6/21/2016,"First of all the wait is always longer than expected. Here is the most gross thing ever so we were finally seated and given a menu. As we were moving our utensils out of the way my daughter spotted three forks and one knife with old dried food on it.. Now if that doesn't make you want to get up and leave I dont know what would. Old brown sticky stuff on the knife and the three forlks looks like it had old dried rice or some fish on something on them. Â I informed our waiter and all he said was sorry I said can you send your manager over here. The manager a lady came over did not introduce herself and said she was sent over here by the waiter and didn't know why. I explained to her the utensils were filthy and unacceptable to eat with. All she said was I will tell the dishwashers Â and bring you new ones said sorry and left. Â  Â  ( cheeezzz thanks)""Unbelievable, with six of us we spent over one hundred and fifty dollars for what filthy forks and a knife. On top of that they brought out three of the six of us meals first the rest of us waited over fifteen minutes to get our food, theirs was already starting to get cold we told them to go ahead and just eat. Â Service was terrible we had to ask for bread twice. Â None of the wait staff smiled or looked as tho they would rather be some place else. Both the response was like robots oh sorry and left.. Waiter never came back to check on us just to deliver the food. My water was down to ice Â I just drank the ice since no one came back to give me more.. Than they expect a huge tip na don't think so didn't do anything to deserve it, Food is not that great and we will not be visiting that location again. If your going to go there let me give you two pieces of advice first just go to Palo Alto location staff is friendly quick and very efficient a more classy place where people are happy and smiling and joking with their customers believe me you will have a much better experience and the utensils will I am sure be very clean. Â And second their management staff is so much better there they come by and say hi and ask if everything is ok. Their not like robots at this Â other location who say sorry like its a everyday word as hello is. Hope this gives you some insight we work hard for our money and no matter how much we spend going out to eat our Utensils should be clean.

Catherine U.,"Los Altos, CA",77,51,4,1.0,1/22/2016,"My bf and I went to this Cheesecake Factory a little while ago, I have been meaning to leave this review. It was a Friday night and they get super busy, so when we were told 35-35 minutes, we decided to grab ourselves drinks and wait. Their mojitos are very yummy. So a while passes, and our drinks are all gone, but we wait patiently, less so as time goes by. Watching people get seated who came after us, I ask my bf to check on the waiting list. He is kind of shy so what the hell, I do. The hosts look at each other and I just knew they messed up. But they lie and say, oh you're next. Whatever. I'm starving. We get seated outside, which sucks, but again, I'm really hungry at this point. And guess what? More waiting. Eventually, a waitress comes by and asks if anyone has helped us, to which we both answer ""no"". She says no one told her they were seating more people in her section and she was on her way out. Ok. That sucks. But she takes our order anyway. And guess what? More waiting. People whose orders were taken after us received their orders before us. Figures. This is just that kind of night. Worse yet, an employee sat at the table next to us with the same dish my bf ordered. Coincidence? NOPE. The waitress comes by, not a minute later, to tell us someone had taken my bf's dish ""by accident"" and they were making him a fresh one. And for the inconvenience? Here's a free slice of cheesecake. We asked to speak to a manager, who very much seemed like she could care less. She basically nodded, faked sympathy, and asked if we got our free cheesecake. I get it, their business wouldn't suffer at all without our patronage. So be it. I'd rather spend my money at a restaurant that actually cares about guest experience.

I forgot which dish I had - it had asparagus and shrimps in it. it was good. The pasta wasn't hard or overcooked. Sauce was light. Do not order the passion fruit tea... it was just straight tea with a hint of fruit. I asked for a second drink, pineapple/orange juice mix... it came back tasting like coconut? Something is wrong here.... Their Ultimate Cheesecake (Red Velvet) was no mas. I don't know if it's popular, but it was all out and none was to be had.

J K.,"Edenvale, San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/11/2017,"Meal was fine. Service horrible. We come here a lot and are so disappointed this happened. They took our credit card and when bill came back and we opened to sign, the credit card was missing. When we asked about this they immediately went into defense mode. ""You sure? Did you check your wallet? I'm a 100% sure I put it back in"". This escalated to the manager. She immediately said they train their staff on cc's and asked if I'm accusing her staff of stealing the card. I tried to explain to her that I feel that when we give them our credit card, it is their responsibility until it comes back into our possession. I think she disagrees. My family was there we saw the bill being delivered back to my dad. We saw him open it and we saw there was no card in there. Now after my dad explained the card was missing he had to use the restroom. So after we and the staff walked around the place looking for the card we decided to cancel it. My dad is from out of town and a cancelled card is not good. After all this, a staff member said he found the card in the restroom under some trash. Maybe it dropped out inadvertently and some guest took it got the number and tossed it in the trash. Still a staff member looking in the restroom finding the card under some trash? Nice detective skills. When she found out and I was trying to explain that even if the card fell out by accident and some guest took it it was still their fault. All I got from her and the other male manager looking person was ""we saw your dad use the restroom."" ""It happens to other guests"" apparently they have an epidemic of people dropping cc's in their restroom. I mentioned that my dad used the restroom after the card was discovered and we all saw him open it with card missing. No way he picked up the card, fail to put the card back into his wallet, go to the restroom and throw his card in the trash. From a pure customer service point of view take responsibility and stop blaming the customer for the error. Basically they said that we lost the card and they found it what do we want from them. How bout treating us like human beings? So now my dad is without his card while traveling far from home. Thanks Cheesecake. No way did Manager or that other guy try to de-escalate the situation. All we could do was not tip and pay. I have to admit Cheesecake corporate was very nice and offered a $25 gift card but we won't be eating at Cheesecake anytime soon.

The servers agreed to let our huge party and two dogs in the outside seating area on a few occasions. They never misbehave and are trained to strictly sit or lay down for the whole meal. However, recently I called and asked (like i do every time) and they refused to let dogs in the patio area. I don't know if they changed the policy, but it was a real let down. I'll probably be coming here a lot less.

Â Scotty is another one whom we had excellent service from as well so make sure you ask to be seated in either one of Â these men's stations when you dine here. I decided to try something different and I'm glad I did. Â I ordered the Americana Burger, well done and with the clam chowder (it's Friday) instead of the fries or green salad options. Â This particular cheeseburger was very juicy, not greasy, for a well done burger. Â I could only eat half as it was so large! Â I did eat most of the soup. My mother had the Chicken Madeira which came with mashed potatoes. Â She said her chicken was full of flavor as was the creamy mashed potatoes. Â Noelle J., my daughter, ordered her fave The Factory Burger. Â It was ordered well done also. Â She noticed that my burger was much larger than hers and a dollar less in price. For dessert, we ordered two cheesecakes: Pumpkin Pecan and the S'mores one. Â The Pumpkin Pecan has a pecan pie bottom layer with pumpkin cheesecake on top. Â It was very good with both my mother and I enjoying it. Â Noelle, being allergic to nuts, could only imagine how good that was. Â I introduced Noelle to the S'mores cheesecake earlier in the fall season and she liked it so much, it's her go-to while it's still available. Â Currently, the Peppermint Bark cheesecake is the new cheesecake starting this month, as the seasonal offering. As I said earlier, Shannon anticipated our dining needs well. Â We had a great time during our lunch as we usually do with the added ""cherry on the top"" of great service by Shannon. Â Before we left, we complimented Shannon on his service to us and asked to speak to his manager. Â She came by and we related how much we enjoyed the excellent service and if he's not on the training team, he should be! Â As it turns out, Shannon is part of the training team for this location. Yes, parking is still horrible here if you don't come early but we avoid that by coming when they first open!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=280

Food: - I am a macaroni and cheese lover, and I was not pleased with their mac and cheese. I don't know how to explain it- but the taste and texture was off. You're better off getting the packaged mac and cheese at Safeway. -Sweet Potato Fries- After trying sweet potato fries from The Counter and the Palo Alto Creamery, CF's fries pale in comparison. They are definitely not crispy, and crispiness is crucial in determining if the fries are good or not. -Chicken Alfredo- Honestly, I prefer the Chicken Alfredo from Costco ( the one that's premade for you). With that being said, CF's Chicken alfredo is okay- nothing to rave about.  -Cheesecake- Now, I will say that their cheesecake is really good, but too bad it's pretty expensive. Service: This place is always packed, and I get that it will take some time to get seated. But, I find it ridiculous that people who came in after me were seated before me! If I didn't say anything, then I would have never gotten seated. Now, this happened only once, and remember that I came here many many times.

I remember being traumatized by the Cheesecake Factory because the last time I came here as a kid I ordered orange chicken and it was freaking terrible. But who orders orange chicken at the Cheesecake Factory, amirite? Came here with a bunch of my girlfriends recently and everyone was raving about the Pasta DaVinci so I had to try it out. Most of us shared because the dishes run about $18 and the portions are huge.  The pasta was okay. It probably isn't fair to compare this to Olive Garden, but this dish does not hold a candle to the worst pasta entree at Olive Garden. Maybe I just had high hopes because 90% of my table ordered it. +1 for the cheesecakes, but they didn't exactly blow my mind.

Since my husband knows that I am fan of cheesecake, we decided to dine here. Waiting time on a late afternoon Saturday is around 15-20 minutes.  The ambiance is good. They serve us freshly baked sourdough while waiting for our food. I think it would be great if they can serve this with olive oil and balsamic vinegar not just butter.  We ordered avocado egg rolls for starters. This is so good. 6 freshly made avocado rolls with a very interesting dipping sauce. I love it! For me this is a must have :) The my daughter had cheese pizza. We ordered the big one instead of the child's meal. Well, it was just ok, nothing extravagant. For my hubby, he had Americana burger. This can be shared (for Asians like us, one can't finish the burger alone) I can say, after being here in Bay Area for just half a year only and had tried burgers all over, this is one of the best burgers I had. The burger, the bun, the cheese, the veggies and the secret sauce, love it! We managed to eat half only. I love to bake and red velvet cake is one of my forte. I ordered ultimate red velvet cheesecake and this is sooo good! Highly recommended!  We were served by John and he was really friendly. As usual we were not able to finish our food, we had to go boxes and John packed for us. We had a great meal. We are definitely coming back.

So because of this, I feel obligated to finally write a heart felt honest review.  Alright the menu here is most definitely intimidating. It is literally top to bottom, page after page lists of different appetizers, small plates, salads, and entrees. No joke, I probably have tried everything on the menu and that itself says a lot haha. I recommend the asian chicken salad. It's enough to feed a small village and it's definitely tasty. Or, if you like pasta I really enjoy the garlic noodles here because it's made like a pasta. COMPLETELY different from garlic noodles from yard house and straits which I personally despise. However the crown jewel of this huge restaurant chain is the pick and pair double entree. You can choose Â two out of the shrimp scampi, steak Diane, miso salmon and the Parmesan chicken. My favs are the steak Diane paired with the chicken. It's definitely the biggest bang for your buck. I always save 2/3 of the plate for lunch and dinner the day after. Service at this location isn't always the best because they're swamped most of the time.

Brandy W.,"San Diego, CA",645,555,118,3.0,5/21/2015,"Wow after yelping for 3 years, it seems my tastes have changed. Â I used to love the food from cheesecake factory. Â Now, it just tastes subpar. Not being super hungry for their super portions, we opted for tapas on their light menu. Â Granted their ""light menu"" has tapas below 500 cal. Â When we opt for 4 appetizers to share, that is not exactly light. Â We ordered the ahi carpaccio, lettuce wraps, spring rolls, and crab puffs. There were two ahi dishes on the menu, one was double the price of the other. Â When I asked the waiter the difference between the two, he had said the amount of ahi varies. Â Boy was he being honest. Â The cheaper of the two had about 2 spoonfulls of ahi! Â They should call it avocado carpaccio with ahi garnish. Â I felt bamboozled. The lettuce wraps weren't much better. Â More than half of the plate was filled with what I call ""cheap filler food."" Â For these wraps that means crispy rice noodles. Â Once again, most would consider that garnish or decoration, but it was necessary to add any substance to the lettuce wraps. The spring rolls contained almost all filler food. Â Instead of focusing on the shrimp, it had noodles in it... noodles in a wrapper. Not even quality veggies.... just carbs carbs carbs. I think the crab puffs, although my least favorite of all the dishes, had the most substance to it. Â Bread crumbs, cream cheese and Krab rolled and deep fried. Â Who knows, maybe cheesecake factory was always like that, but no wonder their calorie count is super high. Service was good at this location, except we had to notify the team of a terrible... spill in the restroom.

I went here today with my little one, who has some serious food allergies and gets very sick after eating soy, eggs, or dairy. Since he's breastfed, I have to avoid the same foods he does. I have gotten pretty good at what meals are most likely safe, and chose a meal for both him and me and asked the server to please just double check they'd be safe. He said the only potential issue was mashed potatoes. When the food came out, I was confused that his meal came with the mashed potatoes. I asked the server who brought the food and she said they were indeed made with dairy. We scraped those off and our server apologized and said he'd get us some carrots instead. As I'm eating my meal, I suddenly notice... THEY MADE IT WITH CHEESE. So they messed up BOTH meals that were supposed to be safe. Mind you, I explained this was an allergy issue, and the server said he talked it over with the chef and noted the specific issues. Our server offered to have my meal remade without cheese, but I didn't feel like I could trust their food at that point, so we removed it from the bill. Aside from that, they charged us in full for everything and just said they were sorry for the ""inconvenience."" Yes... I suppose that's one word for my child crying in pain. Hopefully we stopped eating fast enough that he won't be sick. I will never be back and given how badly they messed up, just don't risk it if you have any special dietary circumstances!

Came here last night to meet some friends, as our tradition has been meeting at a Cheesecake Factory in So Cal or Nor Cal. We were seated in the bar area, ironically because my friend had her baby and a stroller. Which was fine with me since it was before 6, and we could still order from the HH menu! Except only problem was our booth reeked of rotten milk/cheese, and it wasn't the baby! The booth was also a bit of a mess too, lots of crumbs near my seat. We were given sourdough bread, my favorite, no wheat, yay! Which was a bit odd though in case if anyone else wanted wheat. I started with a cosmopolitan, which was only $5 during the happy hour. We also ordered 2 appetizers that were $5, the corn tamales and avocado egg rolls. The cosmo was good and strong, and the appetizers came out right away. There were exactly 3 corn tamale cakes for the 3 of us, and they were huge! They were a bit dense, but really good, filled with corn, topped with sour cream, pico de gallo, and cilantro that I picked off. It was also dipped in a creamy chipotle sauce, so good, but makes you so full! The avocado egg rolls were packed with avocado, too much for me! It's also accompanied with a cilantro sauce, yucky for me! I pretty much always order the farafelle pasta with chicken, even though it's on the list of worst chicken dishes in a restaurant. I was so full from all the bread, tamale, and egg roll, that I had about 3 bites. It was a bit heavier this time, but I now have 3 meals out of it! My friend got the miso salmon, which is always good, and my other friend didn't really enjoy his ahi tuna. From the looks of it, it didn't look very good.

We requested for water from different waiters several times, even the manager, and did not get any water until we told another waiter about our situation. When we spoke to a manager all he said was ""im so sorry about that, ill be right back"" and he never came back. The lady who was our waitress did not check on us nor look at us after we spoke to the manager. She did not even bother apologizing. Ontop of that she looked at us and actually said ""have u guys been here before?"" I understand waiters ask that question but the way she asked us was not right. After waiting for almost a hour for our food we ended up getting up and leaving. While we were leaving the waitress came up to us and asked us what was wrong and when i told her whats going on and how we wanted to just leave she did not bother saying sorry. She just said okay. We went to the front and asked for the bill for the stuff we had ate which was just 1 appetizer which mind you was served 1) cold 2) with no plates. I suppose they thought we were supposed to eat off the table. The manager did not bother coming back to us, or even apologizing, instead he sent over another waiter, with our bill of $40, including a thai wrap we did not touch, 2 lemonades we did not drink and 1 appetizer that was cold. When we asked the employee why the manager did not personally come and give us the check he said the kitchen is backed up and he is busy there. So, im guessing we were not important enough. We told the employee we will pay for what we ate. He went back and said the manager said its okay you dont have to pay. I felt like i was in a low class restaurant.

Samantha D.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,3,,1.0,4/5/2016,I've had the most horrible experience here tonight. If you are having a large party I do not suggest giving your business to the cheeses casket factory at oakridge mall.   I've been planing for about a week to have a dinner for my 2 year olds birthday. I called 3 days before to see if I could make a reservation since a had a large party and I new accommodation would be tough for a party of our size. I was told no reservations were allowed unless it was during the weekdays the first hour they were open. (In my opinion a horrible rule) but whatever I dealt with it. So I arranged for my mom to get there early which was 530 pm on a Monday (I planned for everyone to arrive at dinner at 730). She put our name on the list. I called and added 3 people at 630 we were told we have to wait an additional hour. ( which we were cool with since I planned dinner at 730) by 8pm my guest who have all arrived were getting hungry and my daughter 2years old had still not been fed. So I finally asked what was taking so long the hostess ( a blond girl sorry didn't get a name) told me it was the guest fault and were taking long with the check. Come to find out it was the servers mistake and messes up the tables bill. The hostess then was totally rude Â about me complaining about waiting now 2 hours cause it's 830pm. I was told they only have one table to fit a large party our size 20 . But yet the party we were waiting for was a table of 8. Which I'm sure they gave away our table to. A server then tried to get tough with my uncle who simply asked for a manager and didn't want to speak to anyone who couldn't make decisons. At this time about 845pm I decided to go down to bj's brewery and asked if they could accommodate us not only did they do so they did it with in 5 mins and we had wonderful service and my Daughter finally got to eat her birthday dinner and bj's brew house did a fantastic time job so if your in the oakridge area I'd definitely Â recommend bj's over the Cheesecake Factory.

Our toddler couldn't sit still and it would have been justified if the staff were frustrated with us for even thinking we could handle a meal out. Nope! Our waiter came out with a plate of banana and bread for our little guy before we even had a chance to place our order, smiled at him and said hello. It is really nice when the kids are seen at guests too and are not simply ignored.  Aside from that, our food was out super fast, hot and exactly as ordered. I wish I could remember our waiters name because he certainly did a great job.

Â Later on, Â the server comes back with our same order of wings after they fry it some more....the wings were burnt black. Â Additionally, he tells me that he showed his manager our buffalo wings and the manager said the wings are not raw....that the raw flesh we saw were chicken veins. Â I've had a lot of chicken in my life and let me tell you, Â those wings were not fully cooked. Â I cannot believe the server came back to tell us we were wrong. Â What happened to ""the customer is always right""? Â I'm not sure if he thought I was expecting free wings or something, which clearly isn't the case. Â We ended up paying for crappy undercooked and then burnt buffalo wings anyway, but point is, I wanted my food cooked correctly the first time and not die from food poisoning. Â  At that point, the mood for our dinner was already starting off for the worst. Â My miso salmon was good but after the raw buffalo wings, I lost my appetite. Â  My husband ordered the chicken garlic noodles and the noodles were lacking garlic. Â For the way it tasted, it should have just been called chicken with noodles. Â Our friend ordered some chicken sliders, which were mediocre and nothing special. Â He also got an order of mac n cheese, onion rings, and steak. Â I'd say the food was pretty average and nothing special. To conclude our trip, I'd have to say that it was a waste of $130.

It paired really well with the steak and mashed potatoes. I had asked for medium on my steak and it was cooked perfectly at medium. Thank you to the chef! One thing that surprised me was the portion. It was humongous! If you look at the picture, it doesn't do it justice. The place was so big!  My dad ordered the Thai glazed salmon with brown rice.

Plan for about 10-20ish mins to find parking/walking if you are going on a busy day. As for the food you can't go wrong with the buffalo blasts or the spaghetti.

Charlotte G.,"Freedom, CA",36,33,252,2.0,10/17/2017,"I've only been to The Cheesecake Factory two times. Â The first time was over fifteen years ago and it was with my older sister. Â Unfortunately my memories of visiting a Cheesecake Factory are not pleasant. Â All I remember was the wait to be seated was long but the food was NOT worth the wait. Â I recall having ordered a salmon dish that did not taste very good. Â I ordered their Miso Salmon. Â Unfortunately it was like eating a frozen fish dinner. Â It was overly salty and not fresh. Â It tasted very processed. Â I believe their over seasoning their food is to mask the fact that the food they serve is frozen and not very fresh. Last Christmas my Boyfriend received a $25 gift card for here. Â During the Summer we decided to stop by and use the gift card towards a dessert. Â Mostly because of my bad experience eating one of their entrees and with the high prices of the items on their menu, $25 just doesn't go very far. Â The parking lot was pretty packed which is to be expected because the restaurant is located within a shopping mall. Â We were lucky enough to find parking but I can see that parking can be an issue. Â Once we arrived at the restaurant we headed straight for the dessert display case. Â They had pretty much every kind of cheesecake imaginable. Â From your fruit cheesecakes to the more rich chocolate flavors. Â I love Reese'sÂ® Peanut Butter Cups and decided to order a slice of their Reese'sÂ® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Â It had chunks of Reese'sÂ® Peanut Butter Cups in their original cheesecake with layers of fudge cake and caramel. Â It was cloyingly sweet. Â Unfortunately I couldn't finish it because it was too sweet! Â My Boyfriend ordered a slice of their Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. Â It's their original cheesecake topped with glazed, fresh strawberries. Â He seemed to like it. Â To give you a perspective of their pricing, a $25 gift card just barely covered the cost of two slices of cheesecake! Â We still have like $5 (give or take) left on the gift card. Â Unfortunately the desserts were nothing special and we are likely going to never use the remaining balance on that gift card. Â There entrees and cheesecakes are pretty and professionally decorated but the flavors do not match their outward appearance. Â Buying a cheesecake here is like buying any old frozen cheesecake you can purchase from the frozen food section of a grocery store. Â Which is sad considering the word ""cheesecake"" is in their restaurant name, you would expect them to make the best cheesecake in the world! Â Unfortunately that is not the case. Â The food is dressed up to look pretty and enticing but when you take your first bite, the actual taste is just okay. Â I hate to be so blunt but I need to tell the truth for my fellow consumers. Â This place is definitely overrated and overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=20

We had asked for a slice of caramel pecan & an extra cup of whip cream through the cashier girl who was friendly. Thinking back, the guy worker who brought us our slice was very fast. Perhaps it was another persons order. Anyway, I spread out my cheese cake with a few bites a day because it's too sweet. I realized after almost finishing that I never had a bite of caramel or pecan. I don't even know what slice I've received. Very disappointing....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=20

Davina P.,"San Jose, CA",638,16,3,4.0,6/20/2017,"Came here for happy hour since a lot of their appetizers are only $5.95 a plate. The whole place was very dimly lit compared to The Cheesecake Factory at Valley Fair where they dim the lights towards dinner time.  We sat in the bar area and asked for a happy hour menu even though I've already decided on what I wanted to try before getting here LOL.  While the food looked pretty worth for the happy hour prices I decided paying full price for drinks would be better than the HH drinks they offered.  Drinks -  The Ultimate Margarita ($13.50): I love my margaritas and I for sure loved this one and only needed one throughout HH. Whisky Sour ($11.50): My boyfriend felt like it wasn't strong when he first tasted it so I took a sip. It was well made in my opinion and you can definitely taste the whisky and the orange flavors. It didn't have the bad aftertaste since I normally don't like drinks made with whisky or bourbon. He said he liked the drink overall.  Food -  Avocado Eggrolls ($5.95): While I love avocado and eat guacamole almost religiously, I felt like it was too much avocado in the egg roll itself. The cilantro dipping sauce helped to add an element of sweetness.  Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip ($5.95): I've been dying to tried this for the longest time now and I think I might have hyped myself too much. While it was good in itself, it didn't come out piping hot and was too creamy after I got to the second piece of bread that came with it.  Korean Fried Cauliflower ($5.95): My friend who works at Cheesecake Factory told me that it tasted like orange chicken and I've tried fried cauliflower in Utah before so I wanted to try it. While the sweet orange sauce may resemble the orange chicken, the interior not so much. It definitely could have done without the sauce.  Mushroom Burger ($13.95): It was a mountain of mushrooms and even though a bunch fell out, there was even more mushrooms inside the burger. My boyfriend loves his mushroom burger and couldn't even finish it all since it was so ginormous. My eyes were wayyyyy bigger than my stomach because I've had a bit of everything and then got full almost immediately. Maybe it was because I was grazing on the sourdough and whole wheat bread they offered, which was freshly out of the oven and still warm.  Finished my drinks and took the rest of the food to go since I know I'll end up getting hungry later. Happy hour here is definitely best for trying all their appetizers since they're half off. Just wish it wasn't so dark in there all the time. It even got cold in there and I came to escape the heat!  Would come back when I'm craving rich heavy food and another nice Margarita hehe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=60

It is her job to be approachable after all. But everyone else after that was fantastic.  Our server was attentive, cheerful, and quick. So why the three stars? Because the food really isn't worth the cost. Two adults, one child, and our bill was well over a hundred dollars before tip. Yikes!  Now, if the meals were amazing, there would be no grimace here. But let's just say my kid wouldn't touch her Mac and Cheese after two bites because she said it didn't taste like MnC. I had a bite. It definitely didn't taste like it. How can you screw up mac and cheese? Stick to keeping a kid's favorite dish original rather than dressing it up with fancy cheeses. It changes the whole dish.  I had the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. I was only able to finish less than a third of it. While it initially tasted good, I started to feel a little sick from how heavy the food was. Tasted like it was cooked in two bars of butter and a pint of heavy cream.  I wish I could take the service of this place and couple it with the food at their Walnut Creek location.

We also had to ask for our bread and for a server to take our order. I'm not sure if there was miscommunication somewhere and maybe our server did not know we were there, but come on. I ordered a steak and it ended up being really salty. My colleague ordered salmon and it was really dry. My other colleague ordered a chicken dish which turned out to be mediocre at best. Usually we love ordering cheesecake at the end of our meal, how are you going to go to Cheesecake Factory and not order a cheesecake!?

Betty P.,"San Jose, CA",21,15,29,4.0,2/17/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite to go places for Happy Hour. (despite it being for only 4-6 Mon-Fri I think it's worth it). I never had a problem with getting a seat. A lot of their appetizers that usually cost $12 and over, you can get for only about $5-6. Their Long Islands and Mojitos are really yummy.(For about $5 dollars each also) I am in love with their Buffalo Blasts, Avocado Rolls, Spring Rolls and Stuffed Mushrooms. I don't really get the hype about the Fried Macaronis.  Now if I wanted a plate, I would get the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which is seafood drenched in cream sauce with a hint of lemon (that I really enjoy). Oh did I mention the bread basket? It's soft, addicting and is somewhat on the sweet side. We always have to control ourselves from asking the waiter for more and not get stuffed before our food arrives. The Pineapple Mojito on their regular menu is also a must try.  My only complaint is that one of the waiters in this particular CF is a little preoccupied and out of himself. He would forget orders occasionally, wouldn't check on us unless he was serving food or our bill came and there was this one time where we stated that we preferred the brown bread over the white bread, and he instantly just grabbed the white bread from the basket with his hands.

Al B.,"San Jose, CA",8,156,287,5.0,6/21/2015,"SECOND VISIT So I decided to come back here after a long hiatus for a late night cheesecake run.  The wait time was around 15-20 minutes due to the holiday weekend but that wasn't too much of an issue. Our order consisted of Riesling White Wine, quesadilla appetizer, and a red velvet cheesecake. Let me do a brief a review of each: Riesling White Wine: It was good but a tad bit bitter on the after taste. I liked the sweet aroma initially so that was enjoyable. Quesadilla Appetizer: The quesadilla was really good! Compared to your typical quesadilla, there is guac, salsa, sour cream, and peppers included, which all made it great! I only wish there were more to devour. Red Velvet Cheesecake: This cheesecake was the star of the night. We LOVED it! The portions of cheesecake to red velvet cake was just right and it was absolutely sweet! I liked it but she thought it was slightly too sweet. Decor and presentation was great as usual, which all made our appreciation of this decadent dessert even better. Overall, I had another good experience here. I would definitely come back for more if the occasion arises!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=160
Carmen R.,"San Jose, CA",2,39,8,1.0,12/3/2016,"3 stars, huh!!!!!??? Hopefully this review will bring it down to 2.  My sister had this bright idea to have her birthday dinner at the cheesecake factory, and why not their cheesecake is divine. If this review was for the cheesecake I would have given it 5 stars, buuuut unfortunately it's not. It's for customer service. And as everyone knows I'm a big fan of customer service.  We came in with a party of 12 adults and 4 kids. And having 4 kids in the party we knew to have them fed and napped which we did. However, the hostess here had a different plan. After arriving 30 minutes prior to our planned time we were told we'd have to wait about an hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes. Ok fine. Most of our tables are ready at about the 40 minute mark. However, these two ladies (who were holding up our whole dinner party) just simply couldn't s-t-h-u. After about an hour and a half the hostess decided chatty kathy and chatty nancy weren't going to be leaving any time soon so they sat us down...right next to them. And the two mentioned above were STILL talking. Which is fine and all, but people please be considerate of your surroundings, I know kindness, and manners are a thing of the past, but common courtesy, I thought, was still in circulation.  So we're finally seated, and jabber jaws are still at it.  We meet Nate, our server and he really tries to remedy the situation but, he got me past my hunger point. Hangry is never a good place for me to be. So in all fairness I'll give him a shot. He did his best but it still didn't help the situation.  Chapter 3: so after we're seated they offer us one complimentary appetizer for the 16 of us. Which takes forever to come out. And when it does it's lukewarm. We order our drinks. Which also take a while to come out. I think that was because our sodas and waters were made fresh.  On to the food the only thing worse than the service, believe it or not. My niece and nephew ordered the alfredo pasta who are only 3 and 5 and they didn't even eat it. It was completely flavorless. Mind you I have yet to see these kids turn down a meal. They ate from everyone else's plate so they were fine. The food is mediocre at best and overpriced. Â  This was my second time here in about 5 years and it's definitely my last. Unless of course I wanted the chocolate Godiva cheesecake. Then maybe I'll return...MAYBE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=100
Conner H.,"San Jose, CA",10,20,12,1.0,11/6/2017,Horrible experience. So we arrive at 5pm and put our name on the list. They quoted us an hour and a half wait time for a party of 13. Sure that's fine it's early by the time we would've gotten our table so we decile we will walk around the mall and shop. An hour goes by and we all gather back and decide to wait out the rest of the half hour. It hits the last half hour mark of the wait time. Still table isn't ready they say they're cleaning it. 15 minutes pass. Still the table isn't ready they're still cleaning it. Another 15 pass and they say they're preparing it. Another 10 minutes pass and they say that they're waiting for the other half of the table to leave. So this whole time you lied about the table being cleaned/ready/prepared?? By now it's been over 2 hours wait time and counting. Everyone is very upset because it's already getting late and everyone is hungry. Not to mention it would take another 15 minutes to order and another 45 or more to prepare all the orders. And of course coming with so many orders they leave out some plates and they get cold or under cooked etc (has happened plenty of times before) and of course the manager was no help at all. Will not be returning to this location. You're better off at BJs or Olive Garden. CF quote you a time. But they don't live up to it unless it's small parties. I am sure they gave our tables away and thought they could squeeze as many customers in between the wait time as possible. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE and a huge waste of time. I wouldn't recommend coming here at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=100

After waiting 30 minutes my family got their food and at that time I was told that they ran out of french toast. The manager, Lindsey, told me to order whatever I wanted and she would get it to me quickly. I asked for a waffle.  I waited another 30 minutes. My family finished eating. I asked what was taking so long. Lindsey said the waffle iron was no working right. She never came back to inform me of that. I had to look for her to ask why it was taking so long. She did.not have the common courtesy to tell me. I was frustrated and ended up not ordering any food for myself.  I understand that restaurants get busy.

Sweeny Y.,"San Jose, CA",81,82,53,3.0,5/28/2016,"Usually when I dine at the cheesecake factory in Oakridge I have a good experience. Last night, my mother and I went there to celebrate a work promotion (yay me! But anyways...). We decided to share Avocado egg rolls and an Alfredo pasta. I also ordered a tequila sunrise, in which the waiter asked ME what was in it (wtf write it down and ask your bartender).  First of all, it took days for our food to come out. We waited 30 minutes and our appetizer still wasn't out. He finally brought it out, but we kinda expected our pasta to be out at the same time since it took so damn long (this was when the tequila was wearing off, so I was getting very annoyed lol).  Finally, our pasta came out and it was so MEH. It just tasted like a wet noodle. No salt, no seasoning, nada. I told our waitor after 2 bites that this is not an Alfredo and he quickly apologized and gave us a choice of another pasta. It tasted wayyyy better than what we originally ordered. I'm giving them a 3 star because they handled the situation pretty well. The manager came out (I think his name was Dave or David?) And he said since it would take another 15 minutes for the pasta to be ready, he offered us a complimentary soup or salad which totally helped us keep our hungar down. Our waiter apologized several times and I think genuinely felt bad.  I've had better experiences at the cheesecake in Oakridge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=100

Couldn't hunt down our waiter for the check and when we finally did, there was no one to take it. After a grueling time waiting, we decided to rummage up whatever cash we had in the bottom of our bags so we could just leave it on the table and get out of there. Other than the poor service, I always love myself some avocado egg rolls and $5.50 during HH is definitely worth the crispy avocado goodness. The bread we were given was extremely cold and that was disappointing because one of the best things about restaurants is looking forward to that basket of warm bread. We also ordered the crab and artichoke dip and it seemed good at first then we realized they faced all the burnt sides of the bread down.

I didn't bother checking the bag when the woman, who was very nice by the way, handed it to me. I just put it in my car and went home. I was so excited to eat it but it ended up being like less than half the size of the red velvet. What the heck man?? They usually cut all the slices so evenly and they are a pretty OK portion for around 8 dollars each. I am so sad that I wasted my money on such a tiny slice of cheesecake.

I called back today just to ensure that they had the flavor I wanted, and a man told me they don't even make the smaller size yet! He said that all restaurants in California will be making them, but none have started baking them yet. Sounds like a bunch of BS to me. I called another Cheesecake restaurant (the one with better customer service), and guess what, they do make them and the woman informed me that all restaurants should have them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=240

A. S. J.,"San Jose, CA",72,23,7,1.0,10/17/2016,"This review is for their pick-up/curbside service. 1) I called to place my order. Someone picked up and asked if it was ok to place me on hold. As if I had a choice. Waited 15 mins before anyone picked up the line and finally took my order. They said it would take 15-20 mins. 2) parked in the 10 minute parking for curbside to go and called the number posted on the sign. Whoever picked up must have been on a satellite phone in another country because the static was ridiculous, not to mention she was talking a mile a minute. I said ""Hi, I'm calling from curbside parking to pick up my order?"" to which she gave a response so sloppy and fast that I couldn't even make out what she said. I thought maybe she asked for my name so they could get my order ready to bring out but before I could say anything I was yet again placed on hold. 3) Now another 13 mins on hold and no one has picked up the line, I decide to make another call from my phone to the same number. The same person picked up and I told her what the deal was and did she give any type of apology??? NO. She just said ""uh yea, what's your name again?"" AGAIN??? As if she had got it the first time. I told her and she asked what type of car I was in. I told her and she said she would tell them right now. 4) it has now been another 15 mins and I see door dash people coming and going left and right into this place. Why is it that they are getting better service than their direct customers who make the trip to come to their restaurant for their order? I would have gotten out of the car but I had my 3 young kids with me, including a baby. My 6 year old is now complaining as we have been in the car for a total of 40 mins to pick up one order which is comprised of one entree and one salad. Completely insane.

When I come here I always feel like it's where the ghetto comes to feel fancy or where high school kids bring their dates. The menu is extensive but nothing ever sticks out as a must-have. I always end up ordering from their appetizer menu because those dishes sound and taste better than their entrees. Personal favorites are the Asian Lettuce Chicken Tacos and the samosas. Also the fried chicken sliders. Cheesecake is their specialty so their cheesecake menu is extensive and all of the kinds I've had are very good.

Reena P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",117,231,79,1.0,5/4/2014,"Why is there terrible customer service at 10 pm and 50% capacity? Came here late on a Friday night. We waited about 10 minutes and were seated in the bar area. Our server plopped us down with no pleasantries and gave us our menus. When she came back to get our drink orders we didn't even have water or bread. We had to ask for water and then proceeded to order when she finally came back the next time.  Our order consisted of one diet coke, edamame and fire roasted chile rellenos. The chile rellenos came first and it was pretty good. The edamame proceeded and was plopped down by our server. Â As the plopping occurred she said, 'soy sauce.' We said, 'huh?' Again, she said, 'soy sauce' and we said, 'huh.' After the second 'soy sauce' we realized she was asking if we wanted some with our edamame. She wasn't very pleasant and seemed to be having a bad day. Would it have killed her to say, 'Would you like some soy sauce?' At least we would've been able to understand her.... nonetheless we said yes.  Fast forward 10 minutes and the edamame was almost gone and we still didn't have any soy sauce. We kept seeing her walk by but couldn't get her attention even if our life depended on it. Eventually we wrangled her to our table and got our soy sauce.  Once we were done eating I wanted to order cheesecake, but was dreading having to track her down for a menu. We got another server to bring us the menu and then we got yet another server to take our order. In all that time, our server NEVER came to our table to see how our meal was or to ask if we wanted dessert! Overall, terrible customer service. It seems as though they have too many people working at the restaurant because instead of providing excellent, or even mediocre, service they have time to socialize/flirt with each other. Managers need to step up and make sure their employees are meeting expectations.

Chicken was very tender and the biscuits were soft and warn, vegetables were tasty, and the gravy was creamy and delicious. We shared it, and we STILL had leftovers!

Yadira H.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2016,"Went to dinner last night and was told it was a 30 min wait for a party of 2, got a pager and just stood right by the host table to wait. After 45 mins had gone by I asked the host how much longer only for him to say that ""they had already buzzed the pager for me by they would put me at the top of the list"" OUR PAGER NEVER BUZZED so we had to wait another 10 minutes, when we finally got seated the hostess gave us an attitude. At first we had a male server who seemed nice and we didn't want to take our frustration out on him so we gave him a chance, he got us drinks took our meal order, we waiting 40 minutes for the food to come out ONLY FOR IT TO BE THE WRONG FOOD!!!! we told them that's not what we had ordered and he came to the table to apologize and ask what we wanted to eat, it took another 20 minutes for the right food to come out. Then a server named Brooke came over to tell us she was our server but she had been on break, we finished eating and she came over to ask if we needed boxes, we said no, she left and took 15+ mins to come over to ask if we wanted the check we said yes and she took 10 mins to bring it, we put our credit card in before she left yet she still walked away and took over 10 mins more to come back and grab the card.

Andrea G.,"San Francisco, CA",265,236,498,4.0,8/2/2013,"I love that Cheesecake Factory has half off cheesecakes on July 30th every year to celebrate National Cheesecake Day. Which was exactly why I was there the other night.  The wait was relatively long. When we arrived, the estimated time for seating was about 40 minutes so we stood around the lobby area trying to decide beforehand what cheesecake we'd want to try. Once we sat down at the table, our server came to take our order and to let us know that it was very hectic in the bakery so our cheesecakes would take longer than usual to get to us. We decided to order two appetizers to start: the parmesan polenta fries and warm crab and artichoke dip. Both were delicious.  The parmesan polenta fries appear at first to look like mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce. The outside is a golden brown crispy breading. The inside is soft, a contrast to the crunchy breading. I really thought this was a very good appetizer. Not too filling, which is perfect as a starter. The warm crab and artichoke dip was very delicious. It came with a side of toasted bread. The dip was warm and creamy and you can taste the chunks of crab and artichoke. I would definitely order this again. We wanted to save room for our cheesecake so we didn't order any entrees this time. I ordered a slice of Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which has chocolate cake, brownie, and toasted coconut pecan frosting. I love chocolate so the chocolate cake and the chewy brownie was perfect for me. And I do like coconut too, but tonight, I felt that the coconut was too overpowering in taste that it overwhelmed everything else in the cake. I felt that the coconut stood out a lot more than any other part of the cake. So if you really like a strong coconut flavor, this is the cake to order. I also had a bite of the Snicker's cheesecake and if you're a fan of Snicker's bar, this is the perfect dessert to get. I had a taste of Craig's Carrot Cake Cheesecake and I loved it. Half carrot cake, half cheesecake mixed together, what isn't there to love? And I also had a bite of the vanilla bean. It tasted exactly like how vanilla bean ice cream tastes like. It's plain compared to most of their other cheesecake but still delicious. Service was a little slow the night we went. But considering that many people probably went for the half off cheesecake, I can understand why. The restaurant was packed and while I was waiting in the lobby to be seated, I could see the people working in the bakery section running around trying to fulfill all the orders. Loved the food we ordered. I'll be returning again soon. And I'll for sure return next year for National Cheesecake day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=340
Andy H.,"Anaheim, CA",62,296,356,1.0,12/19/2015,"I love so many dishes and cheesecakes that Cheesecake Factory has to offer, so I come here pretty often. However, the last few times that I've came to this location I've had unpleasant experiences. A little over a month ago our late night server decided to close our check out and not give us the opportunity to order refills on our cocktails prior to the bar closing. Same thing with dessert, which really devastated us since that's one of the main reasons why we come here. We were not given a heads up that the registers where the cheesecakes are at, were being closed down. The server didn't apologize or seem to care when we brought up our concern. Our party left very unhappy, but we decided to overlook it and we ended up coming back 2 weeks later. During this visit, we checked in with the hostess for a party of 4. We were told it would only be 10 to 15 mins. Eventually 30 mins went by and we noticed that groups both larger and smaller, that came after us were being seated. As soon as we asked the hostess why we hadn't been seated and why others that came after we're seated, we were then walked over to our table. I am not sure how we were skipped since we had a ""pager"", but we were just glad to finally be seated. Now during our most recent experience last night, we left unsatisfied. The food for each person of our party of 4 came out at different times, with at least 5 to 10 mins gaps in between each meal being brought out. Which we found strange since it was later in the evening when the restaurant was slow. Everyone's food was either cold or luke warm. The mashed potatoes were so salty we could not eat them. The server was very apologetic and sweet and offered to rectify the issue. The manager came out to apologize and gave us some cheesecakes on the house due to our unpleasant experiences. We got our cheesecakes to go and asked for my cheesecake to be bagged individually, since I don't live with the 3 other people in my party. I took the bag home that I was told contained my cheesecake and put it in the fridge. Today when I got home from work, I was ready to eat my cheesecake just today find out that the server bagged the left over pasta from someone else in my party, instead of my cheesecake. I am beyond frustrated. Bottom line is, none of these issues should have occurred and there is no explanation to them. These last few visits have left a bad taste in our mouth and we definitely will not be returning to this location even though it is much more convenient for us. We will start going back to Valley Fair. After reading all the other bad reviews, I am confident this is the best choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=340

It took a while for the food to come out, and it was a little disappointing considering it wasn't fully packed. other than that though, I got my bday wish + a corny song when my pumpkin pecan cheesecake came out. It was great. Price: Be prepared to spend some bills if you are going to have a dinner with a few people.

When we asked him if we had a booth or a table, He rudely responded with ""You have a table"" I asked if it was in the middle of a groups and once again rudely responded ""Your up against a wall"" I made a comment about waiting for a booth and he said it would be a long wait but when I mentioned that I didn't want to wait after the 30 minutes of runarounds a booth happened to open up. Once seated, our server (the only pleasant part of our visit) came by, took our drink and meal orders. I noticed that my spoon looked a little dirty so I handed it off to her, ""This is a little dirty, but I don't need it so its ok."" After noticing my spoon, I took a closer look at the other utensils and noticed ALL BUT ONE were dirty. I asked for the manager and explained to her how unsettling it was that nearly all of the silverware on our table happened to be dirty. I didn't feel comfortable putting those utensils on my food or in my mouth even. Once I got my drink and felt the etching on the glass, I was startled thinking that the glass was dirty too. The manager tried to tell me that one of the knives was only water stains and I kindly asked if she would run her finger along the knife to feel the grime that I felt. Her facial expression changed. She did assure me that she would be speaking to the dishwashers to make sure that this issue was corrected. To finish off my night, I'd like to move on to our meal. My fiancÃ© ordered a burger, and I ordered off the small plates menu, Ahi Tartar and a side of edamame as my meal. My fiancÃ©'s meal came out first, our server said she would be right back while she checked on my food. While she was gone, another server came to drop off my edamame and to inform me that they had ran out of the Ahi Tartar. At this point I was LIVID. Was this not an issue that could have been addressed before our food was dropped? So I would have had a chance to order something and not have to WAIT? The server who dropped our food off told the manager who was on her way to address the mess up that I was clearly upset. So she asked me ""Would you like another appetizer?"" Perhaps she didn't know that was my meal? I did decline because my fiancÃ© already had his food, I didn't want his food to get cold while he waited for me to get served, and at that point I was too upset to eat. Once we asked for our check, no manager stopped by to make right by the situation, the server just said that they comped the $5 edamame. I did not mention that the host in the beginning was rude to us, because I wanted to move past that and enjoy my dinner........ but that didn't happen. With a rude host, dirty silverware, and the dinner (or lack thereof) I was just ready to get out of there. Working in Customer Service, and having worked in the food industry, in no way was there any attempt at trying to turn my experience around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=400

Satnam B.,"San Jose, CA",122,502,251,3.0,4/4/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake factory for the first time with the wife the other day. This is located in Oakridge Mall past the food court towards Target. I was really impressed with the decor, atmosphere and friendly staff. You need to walk towards the cakes and cheesecake counter if you come in on the mall side and register how many guests. I decided to ask at the counter if there cheesecakes all had eggs, and the attendant did not have an ingredient or allergen chart but said I think so, not good, they should know their ingredients. I wish they made a cheesecake without eggs. Had a short 5 min wait to be seated at a booth. Decided to order fried zucchini and portobello mushroom fries and asked for ketchup vs the dips. Tasted really good! There whole wheat bread and butter also was delectable, I did not like the white bread at all.  I went through the menu and decided on a large veggie burger and fries, boy was the burger big and it tasted really good. My wife went with a pasta dish and she liked it. The staff checked on us often and topped up our waters, asked if everything was ok and was willing to bring more bread. Â It was a really nice experience, then came the bill, $33 for lunch for two! Woah, little pricey if you are looking to fill up, 3 stars, if prices were lower for specials would have given it 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=400
Charlene P.,"San Jose, CA",42,149,197,4.0,3/7/2014,"The biggest downside I have with this place is that no matter what day and time we come here, there's always a 30 minute + wait. I recently just went on 2/8/2014 and had to wait an hour. -__________- Granted it was a Saturday evening, but still are they understaffed or something? They always seem to be moving so slow! As for the food, my favorite dish by far is the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich with chipotle mayo. The meat is so moist and tender and overall yummy! Never get their side salad though. It's so gross and bitter...then again I'm the type of person who likes the plain old Caesar Salad. To each their own. You might enjoy it. Aside from this entrÃ©e, their burger is eh--nothing spectacular. I'd rather go to Red Robin or BJs next door if I wanted a good burger. I enjoy the low lighting and atmosphere of this place, but it does tend to get really loud. It's conveniently placed in a mall where we can roam around before or after our meal.  More often then not, I come here for the cheesecake. Granted it's not the best and smoothest cheesecake I've ever had--it's still pretty good. I especially adore their Red Velvet. But I know people who enjoy their Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake and their Mud Pie.  Another complaint I have though is that their Orange Chicken seems to be hit or miss every time we order it. The very last time we received it, it was nice and moist and covered with sauce. But a couple times before that, they came out pretty dry. AND it's a $17 dish which I think is kind of ridiculous considering all they give you is about ten pieces of chicken and a portion of white rice.  PLUS SIDE. Their Oreo Milkshake is sooooo good. They always blend it nice and thick compared to Red Robin's which can be runny at times.

It had an Asian sauce that went very well with the chicken. There was a caramel sauce that was drizzled on top of the chicken that made it have an amazing flavor. The caramel on the outside made it sweet and crunchy. There was rice served with the chicken that also went well with the chicken. If you go here you should give this dish a try. Dessert: The cheesecake that they serve there is the best. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake and it is to die for. The cake was very moist. The cream cheese in the middle was sweet and creamy.

I ordered curbside delivery 9/26/14 but even after asking for the gentleman who took my order to give my order back to me which was easy (two grilled cheese sandwiches and one order of spicy cashew chicken and 4 slices of cheesecake.)

After 45 mins go by my husband leaves to go get food, comes home then notices the one none kid order was wrong (no spicy cashew chicken) yay, NOT!

Yes we got our chicken dish, but at the cost of time and gas it took it was a total waste.  Completely disappointed in the lack of any customer service.

Melissa T.,"Fremont, CA",293,689,138,3.0,8/10/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory is just OK. I like that it's super close to home and convenient if we're going to see a movie at the cinema next door or happen to be shopping... and their dessert menu (as is the case with the entire chain) is pretty delicious. The entrees at ALL locations are pretty nasty and overpriced, so unless you are on a mission to waste money or see how many calories you can consume in one sitting, I'd avoid them entirely and stick to appetizers/drinks/dessert. This location specifically has a few negatives that are worth pointing out: 1. Less clean than your average mall restaurant. The tables and menus are almost always sticky. Gross. 2. Service generally blows. There are lots of frazzled employees who always seem to either be new trainees or folks who just don't give a sh#t unless they deem you a big tipper. For instance, if you let your waitress know in advance that you're not there for an entree (appetizer/drink/dessert only), they will treat you like an annoyance from that point forward. This tends to mean not bringing any bread out, forgetting drink orders entirely and rushing you out with a check before you've received all your food. 3. It's LOUD. OH SO LOUD.

The meal was good, and the cheese cake was fantastic. I had the warm asparagus salad which I thought was very good. It was light and had a great lemon flavoring to it. I also had the lemon crusted chicken (pretty sure it is called something else on the menu). It was very good, also light but great flavor. The mashed potatoes are very good - I love the chunks of potatoes in them. It also came with vegetables that were cooked perfectly. The portion was very large so I had enough for dinner plus two more meals afterwards (although not as good heated up the next day). Cons - long wait - it was freezing - bring a sweater Pros - great selection of food - quality of food - Cheesecake selection and quality - friendly staff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=480

I always eat at the bar area since its first come first serve, and I only wait to seated in the dining area when I go with a group of more than four people.  I like their menu because of the variety they offer. Of the pastas I have tried, my favorite is the Jambalaya. I did have the filet mignon last night and it was pretty good as well. I especially like the bread here! Â As for cheesecake, it's of course delicious although I hardly ever order since I'm not a desert fan.

Jennifer L.,"San Jose, CA",163,75,29,2.0,11/11/2012,"Cheesecake factory! I just want to say right now that this review is based mostly on the service. The food was great and the cheesecake was deliciousss! But the service....it needs a bit of work. You would think that it would be better since it's such a fancy large chain restaurant, right? Well, I went here for a surprise birthday dinner for my friend, who was currently derping around in the mall until our table was ready. We came in and they said 30 minute wait for 8 people. Keep in mind that this was at 5pm, so it wasn't crowded yet. There was clearly a plethora of seats available. Mmm, okay, we thought. 30 minute wait for 8 people? Not bad!!! So we waited. And finally, 45 minutes later, they tell us that our table is getting ready. Awesome! 45 minutes is still not bad. So we waited some more. A total of one hour passes by, and the people at the front tell us that it will be soon. Uh, okay.  Parties of 6 and 7 people got their table before us.  15 minutes later, we approach them and ask for our table. THEN we get our table. Sooo it took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to get our table when we were told it was going to be a 30 Â minute wait, and in between the 30 minutes and the 1.15 hours, they told us that it would 'just be a couple more minutes'. Thanks.. Our waiter was a very very quiet young guy. We're a party of 8 for crying out loud. SPEAK UP!!! We didn't even hear him ask us if we wanted bread. He is taking our order when my friend asks for a Sprite. So he goes to put it in the computer. Then..he leaves. For 5 minutes. UH... WHAT? You were in the middle of taking our order!! WHY THE HELL DID YOU LEAVE??? So he comes back like it was NO BIG DEAL and continues to finish our order. Oh yeah, and my friend didn't even get his Sprite till 20 minutes through the dinner. It was hard to find him throughout the night. And when we ordered cheesecake, we asked for 1 additional minute. ONE. MINUTE. And he leaves, and comes back 15 minutes later. Uh.............. Thanks for giving us 14 additional minutes.... Sorry for the 12 dollar tip. But, I couldn't bring myself to give more. Maybe next time, when there's better service. Food was great, though.

She suggested healthy food options, gave a very motivational talk with my sister who was trying to diet and lose weight, she was very patient with me in helping me choose the perfect cheese cake... she was great!  HOWEVER, here's when the bad comes. The awesome waitress was off work when we got there so, then that's when she was replaced by waitress number 2. She was a overweight chick with a bad attitude. She didn't check on us ONCE, didn't fill our drinks, didn't do nothing!  Our first waitress was so wonderful we wanted to give her a $20 tip. However, we decided to leave no tip in fear that the heavier waitress would take it. She really didn't deserve it and wasn't good at all. She got an attitude with us when we canceled our cheese cake orders. She was just... bad.  The food was pretty good. I enjoyed it enough to go back.  Oh and awkward moment: I told my half sister I thought one of the waiters was extremely cute. My half sister (who had one too many glasses of wine) randomly told the waiter I thought he was cute.

Star S.,"San Jose, CA",0,19,,1.0,5/19/2014,"Wow. Never have I ever looked at Cheesecake Factory in a negative light until I recently ordered something for pick up today. Â It was irritating to be put on hold and forgotten for 7 minutes when I called to place the order and had to recall. But I let it go because it happens. But when I showed up to pick up my order I walked up to the Bakery and pick up counter and there was a man working there that was busy, turned around, looked at me and turned and continued what he was doing. Not a hello. Nothing. Okay. So then another man came over, light purple button up looking like he's a ""supervisor"" looked at me, and continued on WHILE talking to his coworker. THEN a female came along, did the same thing. All three completely ignored me. I was stunned. So at this point, I stood there stunned while a larger man with a ponytail and beard came over and asked me if anyone had asked me if I needed help.Thank you Jesus! I'm not dead after all! I was starting to feel like Patrick Swayze in friggn Ghost dude. I looked at the two men while I replied ""No, I""m waiting to pick up an order"" so then this bearded dude says ""I'm sorry, they are boxing your order right now"" and I say thank you. Then I overheard him telling the guy to say hello to customers or something like that, it was hushed, and I heard the dude say ""I did""....so Mr. bearded ponytail man, you're employing a liar. You should know. Through his damn teeth.  Now...unless the person boxing my food was creating a box out of organic recycled material himself back there, there's no way it was ""being boxed"" because I sat and waited for a half hour. Keep in mind I have a half hour lunch break. I called at 12:15 pm and was told it would be ready in 15-20 min. So I show up at 12:35. Long story short, I sit, wait, Mr. Purple shirt ""manager"" looks at me a few times, no one says a damn thing. People come and go. Life moved along. FINALLY about 2 seconds before I'm about to leave without my food or paying because I am..SO pissed,, a boy comes out with two to-go bags, rings up like the third person before me and doesn't say I darn thing. Really? Okay I will walk over and ask. Sure as hell my order is chillin there. I literally had to say ""is that mine?"" to get my stuff. My lukewarm, 45 minute, insanely not worth it, stuff. DO NOT tell a client that something is being ""boxed up"" if its barely being thrown in a pan. I would rather hear ""Hey we're sorry, it's gonna be a little longer""or whatever.

The Factory Burger (Its Charbroiled) with Cheddar Cheese, Tomato and Grilled Onions. I normally get this on a baguette w/ bleu cheese sans the cheddar and tomato.  3. Chicken Salad Sandwich- Housemade with Roasted Almonds, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayo. Served on Grilled Brioche Bread. Sans the almonds of course. 4. Shepherd's Â Pie- Ground Beef, Mushrooms, Carrots, Peas, Zucchini and Onions in a Delicious Sauce Covered with Mashed Potatoes and Parmesan Cheese. This is a great savory and hearty dish. A group of our friends were going to meet up for dinner and a movie. It turned out that only two people could make it that one night! Though the restaurant was full (meaning people seated and dining) there was no wait at all. Service from start to finish was seamless and friendly. Our waiter was going on a break, and in standard Cheesecake Factory procedure they introduce the person who will be helping out. My friend had the chicken tacos and I had the original hamburger. Food was fresh, tasty and allergy friendly. For dessert my friend had the lemon raspberry cheesecake and I opted for the original with cherry topping.  My friend treated for dinner and it was agreed that next time I'll pick up the tab. I've been to Cheesecake Factories in California (Northern and Southern) and Washington- its a good chain restaurant which can satisfy even the pickiest eater! On another note- they did bring back the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake but its different; instead of topping it with whole pineapple rings they top it with a pineapple puree (probably more cost effective). Favorite Sweets: Lemoncello Cream Torte Layers of Vanilla Cake and Lemon Mascarpone Cream Topped with Streusel and Served with Strawberries and Whipped Cream. Tiramisu  Italian Custard Made with Mascarpone, Whipped Cream, Lady Fingers, Marsala and Coffee Liqueur. Topped with Whipped Cream and Ground Chocolate 30th Anniversary Cheesecake Two layers of our Original Cheesecake and Two layers of our Creamy Chocolate Fudge Cake filled with Chocolate Cream and finished with Crunchy Pearls of Chocolate. Honey Vanilla Latte Double Espresso, Honey, Vanilla and Steamed Milk Noelle's Notes Sunday Brunch is YUM!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=420

Well just say Cheesecake Factory and watch your friend's heads nod in agreement because there's nothing not to like about these 'straunts (if nobody calls them that then I'm starting it). Unfortunately, part of their brand strategy is to position themselves in busy locations and this one is on the outskirts of a shopping mall in San Jose. I can't think of a busier place in San Jose than a mall unless you say you're at a Cheesecake Factory at a mall. Well you can see where they lost a star here. Aside from waiting an absurdly long amount of time to be seated, the food here is great and accompanied by a tremendous atmosphere with dim lights and eye-catching architecture that is truly sophisticated and eloquent for a chain restaurant. My favorite dishes include the Chicken Bellagio, Kobe Burger, Avocado Egg Rolls, Baja Chicken/Fish Tacos and (sadly not on the menu anymore) Thai Chicken Pasta. If you haven't been here in a while, try it again. They've removed some items and added new concoctions to their arsenal of culinary excellence that you may enjoy. Oh, and Pumpkin Cheesecake.

Lucy D.,"Milpitas, CA",486,786,1873,4.0,5/24/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory serves a huge variety of food from Asian to Western styled food in a classical modern setting. This particular Cheesecake Factory has heated outside seating which is great if you want to be outside.  Pros Food: The food here is really flavorful here and the wide variety makes it interesting to come and try out the new meals that they have. Like the name suggest this place is known for there cheesecake and they don't disappoint. They have a huge variety of different cheesecakes to choose from. There are no real differences in flavors of food between the Valley Fair and Oakridge area in my opinion. They all taste pretty good.  Outside seating: The outside is heated through large heat lamps spread around the area which is really nice if you want to sit outside on a hot day. Also great if you don't like the inside of the restaurant.  Location: The place is located inside Oakridge Mall so its a fantastic place to shop or see a movie afterwards. Definitely a great place to maybe meet with friends or go out on a date.  Cons Parking: Because this place is located near a mall, parking can be really difficult during peak hours so expect to park far from the restaurant if your going for dinner or peak hours.  Crowded: This place doesn't get as packed at the one in Valley Fair but expect long lines during peak hours. Overall this Cheesecake factory gives you a choice of seating outside or inside which is really nice. The food is good depending on what you order and its in a fantastic location for a girls night out or a date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=420

Evangelina B.,"San Jose, CA",355,533,219,2.0,5/19/2013,"Came here yesterday with my family. Six of us ladies celebrating a late mothers day, and three birthdays for my godmother, counsin and aunt. With six of us we were there to spend money. We arrived around 430 so we knew the wait wouldn't be long. We were seated right away( After we barely found parking in their crazy parking lot). Our waitress seemed like she was having a stressed day. I've been here many times and the service here is a hit or miss. Â  My grandmother tends to ask a lot of menu questions but that is what we pay for, the service. The entire time our waitress helped us she seemed impatient and never really asked anything else? Before she left the table. If I asked for Â a water she just walked away. With five other ladies sitting at the table you'd think she would want less trips? I had ordered a burger with fries and wanted some honey mustard. She came back and said they were out. What a strange thing to be out of. I could see if ketchup was since its used more but honey mustard? Oh well. When my godmother got her meatloaf half of it was burnt. It was brought to her attention but instead of offering a new one she said i'll let the kitchen manager know. When it came time for dessert we all ordered one. There's $45-50 bucks right there, just in desserts! Â She came back to say they were out of strawberry cheesecake. My grandmother was no impressed. We all had our desserts and the most popular one they are out of? She quickly made a new choice and got it within a good amount of time. Â When we got our bill it was not split the way we asked from the beginning. Â I was beginning to write it out when she came by to say sorry I'll fix that for you. We wanted to enjoy our desserts and open presents but our table was full of dirty dishes. We called the manager over to voice our bad experience overall. He seemed to listen but didn't seem like he really cared. We asked if he could send someone to clean our dinner plates so we can enjoy our dessert with a clean table and he said no problem. 15 min later and no one still came. We opened the gifts with dirty plates. As we left my godmother spoke to him that no one came to help clear the table. He said he sent someone and apologized. As we were walking out he came out to say he wanted to know if someone did come but we asked the person to leave the table. We told him that was not true, It seemed a lot of people were lying this day. Perhaps laziness from the staff and it was all being put on the manger. I don't know if ill go to this location again.

For the food I'd give justttttt about a 4. closer to a 3.5 but combined with the service, that's enough to have me coming back for seconds. I can honestly say I don't remember the last time that my service was as memorable as this time. Our server seemed to fit right in with my friends and I as we randomly chose cheesecake factory as our restaurant to have dinner. We originally were about to go to boston market to have a healthy meal, but I am most certainly glad we did not. We were seated promptly by our hostess and immediately met Amy who we found out would be our server for the night. She gave us excellent recommendations as my friends and I were struggling to figure out what we wanted to eat. One of my friends was torn between 2 dishes. One of which she told us was not in the menu and claimed to be even better than his favorite miso salmon. Somehow we ended up convincing him to just get both. I had a hard time deciding on which salad I wanted and she went through the salads and seemed particularly enthusiastic about one of them and I was sold. Ended up ordering a pretty big meal for 3 people but she made everything sound so good we figured we'd just pack up the leftovers for later. Food came out and just to show how personable she is, she stuck with us till my friend ate the new thai salmon dish and let her know if what she claimed was true. Unfortunately we still feel like the miso salmon is better but the thai was still very good. we all laughed and had a good time. We had the fried mac n cheese which always a yummy appetizer. eating my salad made me realize why Â she was so enthusiastic about it. it was hella bomb. the marinated steak salad. the steak was done just right. I wanted medium rare but she said that the steak in the salads always came the same way and they're just right so i trusted her and voila. amazing salad. my other friend ordered the grilled pork chop and he said it was mouth watering as every bite kind of just melted in his mouth. and yea, the pork was that soft. all in all a very satisfying meal. OH! almost forgot about our midway meal appetizer. We all kind of wanted to order another ""semi-healthy"" appetizer so we asked amy to accommodate us by randomly picking one for us she thought we'd like. she came back a minute later with a small list. and again. as she listed them, she got particularly excited about the stuffed mushrooms, so we all went ooooooo...and she then informed us that they were hella good and she loved them. sold once again. well that is pretty much it. an eating experience that never had a dull moment all thanks to a server that either loves her job or is really good at pretending she does. she was able to make us all feel comfortable and welcomed. so much so that we felt like we were dining at home.

Always around when u needed her and very attentive. We recommended u always sit with Elizabeth! It's away better when u have a great server. Had to yelp her and let the manager know she was amazing.

I love that they have so many food choices here, but that also makes it hard for me to decide what to pick. But I don't think I've ever been disappointed by the food here, especially the molasses bread! Service on the other hand has been generally courteous, but a little slow. However, this time around, our waitress went above and beyond. Unfortunately, we didn't tip as much as I had hoped due to some bad math. I had ordered the steak and eggs for lunch and my dish ended up being the last one to come out. To make up for it, our waitress brought me my hashed potatoes first so I could eat while my friends were eating. Eventually, the rest of my meal came, but my steak was not what I was expecting at all! It was some strange, sweet marinade grilled flank. And on top of that, it was cold, but my sunny side up eggs were hot. Not sure what happened to my dish, and I wasn't going to complain about it, but our waitress happened to walk by when I said the meat was cold, and she said she would immediately get it fixed. She let me keep my dish, and about 15 minutes later, brought a small plate of properly cooked and well seasoned steak to me. Now that's what I'm talking about! It was delicious! When we got the bill later, she had taken my plate off! Amazing! I wasn't expecting that since it wasn't her fault, but the chef's, but I really appreciated that.

Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",448,567,3762,5.0,3/8/2014,"Upon reaching the front from the mall entrance, I was promptly greeted by three smiling hostesses and seated with no wait whatsoever at 6pm on a Thursday night. Our waiter Dustin D was detail oriented and refilled our water at least four times! This was my first visit at the Oakridge location and I was not disappointed. Prior to my dinner, I had yelped regarding customer service and learned about fantastic waiters being on the restaurant's training team. I am completely convinced Dustin is on it. He waited patiently while we decided on appetizers (one of my friends is a vegetarian), so patiently that I had to ask him for a bit more time. We were ready to order when he arrived with our drinks (four waters, one no ice) and he clearly stated the Caesar dressing has anchovies in it, in case we had issues with that. After my friend ordered her veggie burger, he questioned if I was ok with how the Chicken Bellagio was prepared (pan fried chicken, prosciutto, etc.). The calamari was brought out immediately after, crisp and tasty, but who can go wrong with fried calamari? I did expect a garlic aioli but it seems they exchanged that with a mere cream dip. After the Caesar salad arrived, Dustin checked back to see how the appetizers were. We hadn't touched the salad yet, so I said we were still working on it. He said he wanted to make sure everything was ok. I also asked for fresh Parmesan when my meal arrived, which was brought over immediately. Our waters were never empty for longer than five minutes. When dessert time came around, I ordered the ultimate red velvet and white chocolate blueberry cheesecakes to go while a friend ordered carrot cake to go. Our apps and meals were boxed for us and we were asked if there was anything else they could help us with. Our waiter truly cared if our dining experience was up to our standards, and I'm grateful it was since one of our party was a first timer for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=520

Amy T.,"San Jose, CA",360,63,31,3.0,1/22/2014,"My sister, my cousin, and I decided to come eat here Tuesday night for our monthly catch-up dinner. We were seated immediately. Our server, Junno, was super sweet and patient with us -especially since we had very complicated orders.  My cousin and I were probably most excited for our side orders of mashed potatoes with wasabi butter but 5 minutes after we ordered it, our server came back to tell us they had run out of wasabi butter. That was the first disappointment of the night. My sister ordered a steak and asked for it to be cooked medium rare. As she began eating it, she then realized it was cooked super well done. So we flagged down our server and he was very apologetic, and immediately brought her plate back to the kitchen to be re-cooked. The manager then approached our table shortly after and was extremely apologetic and sweet. He even told us to save room because he wanted to give us a dessert on the house. The service alone from this point deserved 5 stars on its own because not only were they genuinely apologetic for the minor mistakes, but they even remade my sisters steak, and the manager offered a dessert on the house. We then ordered a red velvet cheesecake in the end and just like dÃ©jÃ  vu, the server came back 5 minutes later to tell us that the red velvet flavor was all gone. So we decided on a different flavor. However, the bill then came out and we were charged for the dessert! I'm sure it was Â a genuine, honest mistake, but still... It was the fact that the manager had already told us we would receive a dessert on the house. By this point though, it was already 15 minutes until closing, and we're not cheap people so we weren't going to interrupt the busy manager just to comp our dessert.. Overall, the server was great; he did his job very well and it obviously wasn't his fault that certain foods were all gone. On the other hand, no wasabi butter, no red velvet cheesecake, and forgetting to comp our dessert when they promised us it would be, are good enough reasons to take away 2 stars. But I feel like we just came here on a bad night. We've eaten here plenty of times and 8 out of 10 times, I've had a great experience nonetheless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=520

I think happy hour's are the best creation ever and the selection at Cheesecake does not disappoint. They have house wines for $5 a glass, beer for $4, and a few selected cocktails like the Cosmopolitan for $5 as well. They offer two pages of food- the first page is a selection of their full size appetizers for $5! And yes, you get the full size! Fried calamari, sliders, nachos, egg rolls, fried macaroni and cheese balls...I think there were like 10 options. On the back side they offer other food selections ranging from $3.95-6.95 (or something close to that). I had the ahi tuna tartar.....it was good but too small. I recommend ordering from the 1st page of full size appetizers to get your money's worth. All in all, it's the best of Cheesecake quality food for the price of Denny's.

Â Truthfully, I rarely eat the cheesecake because I don't typically have room left over for dessert. Eating out is more than the food, though. Â Service is key. Â Today the Cheesecake Factory blew it big time with their service. Â Everything started out ok. Â We had to wait 35 min for a table, but with a group of 7 on a Sunday night that wasn't unheard of. Â Once we were seated our waiter came right over and took our drink order (and we ordered the crab wantons at that time too). Â We got our drinks and our waiter told us that our bread was cooking as well as our wantons. Â And then he was gone. Â  Eventually he came back with our wantons and took our dinner orders (still no bread). Â Drinks were never refilled. Â We did not see our waiter again until after some of our dinner arrived. Â Our meals did not come out together. Â Both kids meals and 2 of the adult meals came at first. Â Then 2 more arrived, but one entree was delivered with chicken, when it was ordered without chicken (chicken had to be added to this entree for an extra charge). Â It was taken away to be fixed. Â My brother's entree did not arrive, but our waiter told us it was on its way. Well, the kids and one of the adults finished their meals before my husband found the manager and told him that most of us were finished with our meals and 2 of our meals were still missing and that we had never received our bread. Â Then the manager disappeared. Â The waiter returned with the fixed entree, but still no entree for my brother. Â My brother then told the waiter that he is diabetic and had already taken his insulin in anticipation of dinner so he needed to have food pretty much now or he was going to pass out and cause a medical emergency. Â Again the waiter disappeared. This time he reappeared with our bread. Â Which my brother used as a band-aid to counteract the insulin. Â The waiter told us the manager was waiting on the line and that as soon as the entree was ready it would be delivered. Â By this time everyone else was finished eating. Eventually my brother did get his food, and the manager removed it from our bill. Â My husband pointed out that one other entree was made incorrectly and it took an inordinate amount of time to be fixed and that entree was also removed from our bill. Â My daughter and I each received a complementary dessert for our birthdays. Service goes a long way. Â Good service will get repeat customers.

My boyfriend and I happened to get a waiter that really didn't pay attention to us most likely because we are young and he probably assumed we don't tip (which was bad on his part) but anyways the main reason for my review was because they got my order wrong which I totally understand happens from time to time no big deal. I had the right food but wrong noodles. I was going to suck it up and just eat the meal but I tasted the noodles and they tasted way weird and were awkwardly green. I wasn't going to pay for something that I wasn't going to enjoy. Long story short they took my food and brought me out my other dish and the meal basically had no food.. just nothing but the noodles that I had originally asked for. I don't know if they were trying to teach me a lesson by being up upset I sent it back.

The food server brought us the food but no extra sauce, we immediately said we ordered extra sauce, he said I know I'll be right back. We waited 2 or 3 minutes and nothing. I got up and went to the kitchen where I met the manager and I told him what happened. A different manager came to our table and said he was sorry and hovered over us for a couple of minutes, I asked where the sauce was, he said it will be out in 30 seconds he left and brought it out 3 minutes later.

If you go during the weekend dinner rush be prepared for a short wait.  For some reason I almost always order the chicken salad sandwich or club sandwich with fries and a side of creamy ranch dressing. The waiters and waitresses have always been attentive and friendly.  If you dine with children, ask for their bread/fruit plate for the kids. They'll serve the kids a small plate of fresh fruits and some table bread. The kids love it because it's their own!

I usually go with my bf, and he and I share any pasta and salad. I loveeee the frozen iced mango and red velvet cheesecake. Definitely try that one out. I don't have any complaints about the food yet. I've liked everything I've tried so far.  The reason for the 3 star review is because of one incident. We were waiting to get seated because they told us it was going to be a 10 minute wait. So we weren't fussy about it and decided to chill out. Meanwhile, another couple walks in and asks how long the wait is. The hostess said it would be 10 minutes, and the manly dude says, ""NEVERMIND. WE'RE LEAVING."" Immediately after he said that, the hostess says, ""Oh wait. We have a table right here for you."" My friend gives them that -____- face, and he won't stop biscuiting about how they're so shady. It is kinda mean, though, because there were a few people ahead of them.  We'll probably be back.

Our server and her helpers were always there, never with an empty drink and always returning promptly with any condiment request and was always within earshot if we needed something. At many restaurants, they split a server's section to a couple tables here and a couple tables there. Here, she had two tables adjacent to our table and 3 tables across the way so she was never very far away. So why not 5 stars?  Some things could be changed, some things obviously not. 1. We were celebrating a birthday. There were 5 or so servers singing happy birthday. It was super lame. They all could care less so much that I couldn't even sing along. 2.

Took another long time for cheesecake to come. Cheesecake was good. Experience was a complete disaster. Women's RR was also a complete disaster, according to wife, clogged toilets and broken seats.

They have trimmed their menu and come up with some really different stuff. The quality of food and service is great and even though generally it is written in stone that chain restaurants should have 3.5 or less this is far better than some of the mom and pops out there. They have great cheese cake. It is the foundation of this business and we really enjoyed lemon raspberry cream cheese cake. Somewhat it was better in the old times but it seems like everything was better in the old times. It's about that whole nostalgia that takes over our minds and drives us to covet what we don't have anymore so that we can pick on what we do. At the end the IPA beer really works with the mushroom burger and it is now and today that counts best.

Next we ordered spinach and cheese dip which basically tasted like frozen spinach and olive oil with a little parmesan on top. Gross. Next was the sweet corn tamales. They were the best part of the whole meal, only reason they get 2 stars. We split a factory burger, which i can say i would have preferred a whopper. The meat was bland, the portion was TINY for $13, the fries were cold and they borough onions on the side not cooked. We had to remind them what was on their menu. When they brought out the grilled onions they were COLD AND SLIMY. Overall I've had better customer service at a McDonald's and better food as well. Speaking of which, the only time we didn't need to flag down a service staff was when he was collecting payment. Nobody ever asked how we were doing, if we were enjoying out meal, anything of that sort. I've been to this place a few times, so I'd be willing to call it a fluke, but they need a more authoritative manager who acts more customer-centric.

The wait was 45 min like the hostess said. Perfect. We were seated immediately, but it took a while for the server to come by our table.

I think the menu is too much. Too many options and too much to look at. But, for the most part their food was pretty good.  Miso salmon- $20 , salmon and sauce was so good. Rice- way too dry and grainy. Like, c'mon I'm asian I know good rice....  Mushroom burger-$12, Â good sized patty but too much cheese... Kind of overpowered the taste.

Kay T.,"Zzyzx, CA",8,50,28,5.0,11/10/2010,"I went here after going to the Burke Williams day spa nearby. It was noon and I was ready..........to stuff my face with delicious food! I ordered the lunch pasta (pasta da vinci) with a small salad. My mom went with the 9.99 special which included soup, salad, and half a sandwich. When I got my lunch, it was amazing to look at. The Pasta Da Vinci is basically the ultimate pasta. Tender chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions tossed with parmesean cheese in a creamy, rich madeira wine sauce. From the way it looked, it was like the sort of dish you would see in an upscale restaurant or in a magazine. You could tell that a chef made it to order and it wasn't pre-made or reheated.  The salad looked like a work of art. Mixed greens. It was crisp and refreshing. For a ""small side salad"", I didn't think they would put so much. Verdict: awesome. Whereas, the pasta was al dente, the sauce was creamy, rich, flavorful. From the way it tasted, it seemed like they didn't take a lot of steps to make it. Whatever they did, I am in love with this pasta. If you ever go to the cheesecake factory, you have to order this (unless you can't stand onions or mushrooms like my brother, in which case: you should try it anyway lol).  My mom got the crab bisque soup with a turkey sandwich and one of those ""small"" side salads. For 9.99, the platter was massive. It was totally worth it. The soup was delicious and rich. Chunks of crab (might've been lobster) in a creamy white broth. She ate all of it and was already feeling full, but she still had her sandwich and salad to eat Of course, we couldn't leave without trying some of their famous cheesecakes. I'm not normally a cheesecake fan, but I'll always make an exception for this place. I picked the key lime cheesecake and my mom got a godiva cheesecake with the chocolate tower cake. The key lime cheesecake was creamy, with a citrusy tang that cleans your palate. If you like lighter, fruitier desserts at the end of a heavy meal, like me, get this. Even though the key lime cheesecake was good, I'm secretly hoping that the mango-lime cheesecake makes a comeback (it's my favorite!). The godiva cheesecake would've been insanely good.......had it not been put up against the insanely gargantuan chocolate tower.  The chocolate tower consists of solid layers of chocolate mousse, thick chocolate frosting, thick chocolate shavings, thick fudge chunks and moist chocolate cake, all thrown together to form the ultimate chocolate masterpiece. It is about 8 inches long and massive. I would love to see what the entire cake looks like before they cut it. lol Yet, in terms of flavor, it is not too overwhelming. It has a balance to it, so that all of the awesomeness doesn't overwhelm you at one time. Basically, if you are a chocolate lover, order this dessert and you will not regret it (only if you try to eat all of it in one sitting). lol I only took a few bites at a time because it really is that rich. All of the desserts came with the signature real whipped cream and my tummy was happy for the rest of the day. lol Totally worth it. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=600

I got the spicy chicken chipotle pasta which was delicious. i still have leftovers! I would have never ordered this if I hadn't tried my friends the last time I was here. It's a penne pasta with with a sweet side and a little kick. There are also little crispers on top that you mix in that help give it a crunch. No appetizer today. Just bread and butter, bread and butter, bread and butter. My friend got the tuna salad. It was actually good! seared tuna with mixed greens, avocado and tomatoes. The portion of the tuna was pretty decent. Must try that when I feel like eating 'light.' (that's not too often :x) I was here a couple weeks before-- got the crispy fried artichoke hearts under their 'small appetizers.' i love artichokes and it's very good here. you might need more of the dip though since it comes in this minuscule bowl. That time I went I got the lemon herb roasted chicken. mmmmmm the sauce and seasoning on it was so good, brah.

However, the kids enjoy it so we still go. Had an unfortunate event this last time, however.  Long story short, the lettuce on my son's kid's slider burgers was brown and crusty. I'm assuming that it was because it was placed on the side of the burger and kept under the heat lamp until the rest of the food was ready. But worse than that, there was a string in my meatloaf! At first I thought it was a very course hair (which would have been worse).  The saving grace was the manager who was on it like white on rice. He's the reason my review went from 1-2 stars to 4. He took care of the bill and got me a new order all wrapped up to go. I know this type of stuff sometimes happens and it just comes down to how the establishment reacts.

Neon D.,"San Jose, CA",155,92,9,5.0,5/7/2010,"I am a weekly regular to CCF and let me give you the rundown.. bullet points, no less: (let's start off with the good stuff, shall we?) * Amazing food selection. You feel like going Tuna crazy? You can! I love the Tataki Rare Tuna salad which comes with the most divine dressing ever! The fried tuna rolls are to die for and every other rare tuna dish they serve is top-notch. * If you feel like pigging out, then this is your spot. The servings are SO huge that I took home HALF of my meal and told my fiance it was the meal I bought for him. He believed it!!! I'm evil, too! The waitress even helped me add extra garnish and was in on my plan! Muahhhh! * The staff (except for the hostesses, sorry) are freaking amazing. We've had waiters that looked like Dolce & Gabbana models. They are all fun and we always end up talking about some crazy customer or annoying kid in the restaurant. I love it! The sad part is, I never get the same person and I do have my favorites! It is fun to mix it up though. I like to sit outside in the summer. The hostess staff hasn't always been so friendly, sometimes all-out snobby and snappy. Ew, honey, you ain't that cute to have that kind of attitude.  * Ok, so I think I crossed into 'the bad things' territory. It takes forever to get the hell out of there. I think I spend at least 2 hours in there just at a casual dinner on a Thursday or Saturday night. Sometimes I don't want cheesecake, but am a sucker for that damned Red Velvet Cheesecake. I get it every single time and once ate the entire thing by myself. Ughh. the shame! The only thing they are missing is a wheelchair service because I can't walk when I'm through with dessert! I've given thousands of my dollars to CCF over the span of 3 years and from them, have acquired the biggest waistline I've ever had.

Â It was also The Cheesecake Factory's anniversary, which meant that all cheesecakes were 1.50. Â Wow, cool! The food was good, I had a mini-pizza and a salad. Â Portions were huge, we all took home boxes of food, Â enough for dinner tonight! Â The menu was fresh, everyone found something that they liked, even my dad, who is a picky eater (he was severely challenged when we took him to Bennihana!) said that his fish and chips were the best he's ever had. Â My sister said that was because they started with Ahi tuna! This is one BIG restaurant! Â It is HUGE! Â There must be fifty tables in the restaurant, and perhaps why it feels like you are in a big barn, with food being shoveled out at you. Â It would be the relationship with your food server that could make or break your dining experience, because this is the one thing that distinguishes you from those other tables. A word about the service. Â Well, it wasn't rude, it was just... Â well, it's hard to put a finger on it. Â Let's just say... it wasn't warm and it wasn't attentive. Â We had to flag our waiter down for more bread (he brought one basket of three breads for our table of six, one of whom was having just a salad). Â When we told him it was Mom and Dad's anniversary, he said, ""oh, kewl (the all lower case is on purpose, because that's how he said it: all lower case)."" Â One of the weirdest things was that other waiters came looking to see if we were ok, and one, when checking on us said in a really snippy way, ""Well, _you're_ ok!"" and rushed off. Â It was really strange, but it's about what you can expect when you are being waited on my 18- to 20-year-old waiters and waitresses. Â So, there it is, it all comes down to attitude.

Â I wasn't in a very pleasant mood when we arrived (it was on the warm side and the air conditioner in the car wasn't working right.

Â Although the clam chowder was very good and full of clams, celery, potatoes and all the other goodies, I wouldn't say it was the definitive clam chowder. Â Still, it was good and I would order it again. Â But oh! Â Was the dip ever yummy! Â The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was served on crunchy baked and seasoned french bread strips; the dip had a very delicate flavor of it's own, and it had to ""fight"" with the flavor and crunchiness of the french bread. Â I used the softer bread that was served in the basket Â and found that it tasted so much better. Â You could actually taste the flavor of the crab! Â Huzzah!  We should've stopped there, but no. Â We ordered (and shared) a Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira Combination plate. Â I think I have finally found my favorite dish at the Cheesecake Factory.

We didn't have reservations because we made a change of plans from our original restaurant so we did have to wait; surprisingly the wait wasn't as long as we thought considering we had a huuuuge group. As we were seated in this lengthy booth, they quickly got us our drinks and as we ordered and waited for our food they constantly came to check up if we need refills...personally this annoys me but I know they're just trying to maintain good customer service so I just kind of shrugged it off. I did love the fact that they had bread out while we waited, restaurants are doing that less and less now. I got the four cheese pasta like I do at every other restaurant because I loooooooooove pasta. Â The entrees were meh; not bad and at the same time not exactly something I would rave about.

Should have checked prior to making the recommendation.. oh well! Dad settled on a green salad... he said it was okay good. Mom also had a salad - the goat cheese with the spring mix and cherry vinagrette which she enjoyed. Dave had their coconut chicken and shrimp curry which came with rice, he said it was good and liked it. He liked the toasted coconit garnished all over the curry. I ordered the Jamaican Pepper Chicken and Shrimp which ame with rice and plaintains. The plaintains were a little over cooked and mushy but the rest of the dish was okay -it missed the pepper kick I was looking for.

I worked here for 9 months and learned how to truly take care of guests because their training is very intense. Â They have to follow 12 steps of service such as: Greeting time, ticket times, refolding your napkin if you get up, showing you to the restroom if you should ask, always bringing share plates when an app is ordered, proper silverware for certain items, wet naps for messy items, etc etc.  (If you come here and don't get good service it's because their best server is gone.. ME who else did you think I was talkin about. LOL. jk) This restaurant is ridiculous...they have a book for a menu. Â There are about 200 menu items making it extremely hard to decide. While you are browsing the pages, the server will bring you sourdough and pumpernikel bread (yaaa i said it.. PUMPERNIKEL w/ Oats on it) and REAL butter pats. To top it off it's fresh baked on site.  Some of my favorties are as follows: ****Jamaican Black Peper Shrimp--served with white rice, black beans, fried plantains and a mango salsa--outta this world good. HUGE PLATE!!! *****Firecracker Salmon Rolls Appetizer---kinda spicy so watch out if you're a woosie! *****Sante Fe Chicken Salad----all time fave. It's drizzled with their very own spicy peanut sauce. *****Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake---3 layers of chocolate goodness. Those are just a few to name...You must try it if you never have. If you have and had a bad experience...give it another shot. When asking for a table be sure to ask for their best server...(most likely you will get a ""D.T""..which means a designated trainer. These guys are super passtionate about their job and they will take great care of you. Last night, Paul served my GF and I... he was awesome. I got their Arugula Salad and it came out lookin old and tired...he didn't charge me for it, which was nice. She and I shared the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich, it comes with ff but we got a salad. I alwaysss add buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing to mine; it's outta this world. If you feel too stuffed after dinner --- and i promise you will --- take some cheesecake to go.

Their portions are pretty big...for everything! You can share one their signature salads with someone and still get a be full! For those on a budget, you can simply get a good meal and them some with their sandwiches. There has been only one rare moment where I experienced bad service. They are really welcoming! Here are a few of my faves: -Avocado Egg Rolls (Appetizer)- The sauce! -Factory Nachos with Chicken (Appetizer)- Share with 2 others. -Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club (Sandwich)- Towering Sandwich. -Monte Cristo Sandwich (Sunday Brunch)- Deep fried breakfast sandwich! -Baja Chicken Hash (Sunday Brunch)- Mexican Breakfast -Beef Ribs (Steaks & Chops)- Literally falls off the bone! -Grilled Rib Eye (Steaks & Chops)- One of the most succulent steaks I've had -Luau Salad (Salad)- The crispy wonton chips are mmmmm! -Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake (Cheesecake)- Red Velvet, nuff said!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=620

My all time fave: Chicken Piccata! I love it because it's a creamier version of chicken piccata. It goes rather nicely with the pasta. Mix the sauce with the pasta and add a bit of the chicken and bam! Explosion of the reduced white whine, a slight tang of the lemon, the creaminess from the (you guessed it) CREAM, and the saltiness of the capors. OoOO wee--! I love it!  Now, you all know that there is several choices there. I can't guarantee they will all be good. I've heard the sweet and sour was a bit eh. I do like the chicken salad sandwich (that crunchy bread is to die for!). The new small plates menu is pretty awesome. YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THE VIETNAMESE TACOS. I can't even describe them.

I'll admit that cheesecake factory entrees are calorie ridden and not very good for you but with pizza it's easier to stop myself and save a slice or two for later and have it still taste good! After all, the free bread is pretty filling. On the other hand, I did not enjoy my eggs Benedict at all. The eggs were overcooked and half the plate was just hash browns. For the price, that much potato was kinda a cop out. Mostly I'm just annoyed by the overcooked eggs though.  Overall, service is a gamble since they have so many people working here.

Badri N.,"San Jose, CA",601,324,137,3.0,7/17/2009,"Went here on Thursday night with fellow Yelper Noelle W. after watching a movie at the mall. Location is easily accessible from the 85 and 87 freeways but parking, oh my, is parking a nightmare or what!!!! Â My advice - don't even try to find surface parking in front of all the restaurant chains if it's after 6 PM - you will waste fuel and endanger the planet! Â Head on into the parking garage, up to level 2 or above and you will usually find parking quite readily. Â And you don't have to walk in the sun/rain/wind - or other natural element! Â FTW! ~ 2 stars for location (- 2 stars for parking situation!!!) Decor is your typical cheesecake factory - faux Italian marble everywhere, very elegant looking, with high ceilings, very wide open spaces and airy, comfortable atmosphere. Â Tables are packed but not too closely together so it is possible to have a conversation. Â It's not too dark and it's conducive for a lot of different occasions - from business meetings to family outings to quiet dinners. ~ 4 stars for ambiance and decor We were seated promptly and the waiter (Christian) was almost immediately there to explain specials and take our drink orders. Â He was also training a rookie waitress who was very polite and professional throughout the meal though she did forget a couple of things and had to go back and fetch them. Â But that's how you learn, so no points subtracted for that - everyone's gotta learn and she certainly had the right attitude about it! Â Our food arrived promptly (except for the cheesecake which took a really long time!!!), drinks were kept filled and takeout containers brought out promptly on request! ~ 4 stars for service Now, the food. Â I never have high expectations when eating at these mega chain restaurants. Â Especially ones that have menus that are reminiscent of phone books. Â It was amusing to read the little supplement that listed the caloric values of all the menu items. Â I didn't see one single item there that was less than 1000 calories and quite a few that were over 2500 calories!!! Â Aiyiyi - Good Lord have mercy!!!! Â  I ordered the Baja chicken tacos which were quite good but nothing like the neighborhood taqueria. Â Chicken was quite flavorless but the seasoning was good, especially the generous amount of cilantro!! Â The black beans were OK but the rice was kind of a cool mixture between normal brown rice and a Chinese inspired fried rice with peas and scallions - I enjoyed the rice and I'm normally not a big rice eater! Noelle got a burger protein style and it came wrapped nicely in aluminum foil (I was surprised but it was a cool way to keep it warm!!). Â Also, they had followed her special instructions quite well and she seemed to enjoy it. Â  ""I normally don't eat dessert."" Â This is what I said when the waiter brought around the dessert menu. Â But I proceeded to completely demolish the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake which was good but a tad too rich - I've always enjoyed the plain New York style cheesecake and should stick to that - no creative flavors for me - I'm a simple guy with simple tastes!!! Â It was smothered in way too much whipped cream - I had to push the cream out of the way and ended up eating much much more dessert than I would normally eat in a month! Â Bleh... Â major food coma looked certain in my future - thank goodness I had a short drive home where I could be at least be comfortable if I ended up getting sick - thankfully, I didn't! Total check for 1 beer, 1 iced tea, two entrees and two cheesecakes = $47 ($57 with tip) - not too shabby! ~ 3 stars for food - it met expectations (which were not too high, being a chain restaurant) ~ 3 stars overall for Cheesecake Factory.

Iona C.,"Orinda, CA",491,374,1909,3.0,4/21/2007,"Menus at The Cheesecake Factory have one side covered with a company's advertisement and the other with an actual list of dishes, something I've definitely never seen before. The process of choosing a dish can take a while since there are many sections to look through: Appetizers, Pizza, Specialties, Lunch Specials, Pastas, Fish & Seafood, Steaks and Chops, Salads, Sandwiches, Eggs & Omelettes, Sunday Brunch, Desserts, Cheesecakes, From Our Bar, and Beverages. Luckily for me, I happened to get there before 5 P.M., and could still order from their Lunch Specials. I opted for their Four Cheese Pasta (mozzarella, romano, parmesan, and ricotta with marinara sauce and fresh basil). It didn't take too long for my food to arrive, but when it did, I was a shocked by the portion size. In the Lunch Specials menu there was a small line saying that that section provided menu favorites in smaller portions. Now if what I saw in front of me was supposed to be 'smaller'... then I certainly did not want to see what the full sized portion looked like. If one healthy portion is said to be the size of your palm, the Four Cheese Pasta was easily four or five portions.  At first glance, the Four Cheese Pasta didn't look that spectacular. But once I dipped my fork in, I realized that the four cheeses were hidden under a layer of the penne rigate style noodles they used. The blend of cheeses with potent fresh basil and chunky tomatoes in the marinara sauce made for a definite A+ rating. Now here is where I get to talk about the crowning part of our experience at The Cheesecake Factory, the desserts! Â I ordered the Godiva Cheesecake (layers of flourless Godiva chocolate cake, Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse ),  The desserts arrived a few minutes later. Â I'm a complete 'chocoholic' and thus fell completely in love with that dessert. The smooth, creamy texture of the cheesecake combined with the richness of Godiva chocolate made for a winning combination!  With one of the Lunch Specials, a dessert, and tip, you should expect to pay around $20.

Then they were 2 times waiting on the bread delivery. Once we never got it and the second time it took 15 min until served. No cutlery though.  Favorite dish Steak Diane is unbeatable.

We had a voucher for a free slice of cheesecake for every $30 spent. We became legends... We ordered everything off their happy hour menu (x2 or sometimes x3 off things we liked). We had to combine two tables and still couldn't fit all the food. The waiter was amazed and never seen anything like this.  We enjoyed their sliders, cuban sandwiches, macaroni balls, thai lettuce wraps, cobb salad and of course gobbs of free bread. Sliders - small, kinda shiny (greasy) but easy, fun to eat. Be sure to get the side order of fries for a buck. Cuban Sandwiches - toasty, pork and ham go well together, with the swiss cheese melting off the side. YUM! Fried Mac and Cheese - very interesting since it doesn't taste like the box mac and cheese. It doesn't have the overly cheese taste which makes it good. Marinara sauce compliments the FM&C. Thai Lettuce Wraps - chicken with lettuce and a few veggies with sauce. Very tasty when using peanut sauce. Def. not as good as the Asian places but it does its job. Cobb Salad - typical salad but good to order to accompany all the heavier foods Everything else (off their happy hour menu) we could pass on.  Now for the 3 Cheesecake, we got plain, red velvet, and Oreo. Plain is the lightest and taste like ehhhh. Oreo was my favorite since who doesn't like oreos with cheesecake. Red Velvet was humongous. People in my party liked it but man I think its over 1500 calories. Overall food is decent.

Every time my coworkers get excited about a special lunch out and actually propose this overpriced CHAIN, I feel like gagging.

It is very difficult to have a vegetarian, non-fried appetizer and lunch course here that doesn't consist of some nutritionally poor substitute like iceberg lettuce with ranch dressing, or my favorite : ""grilled veggies"" (read: squash and zucchini). Â Also, the inflated prices and service were an insult- last time our waitress treated us like we were an inconvenience. I can easily think of ten other places to spend $25 on lunch.

OK, I keep doing this reality check, or am I the ONLY one suffering from the economy. Why is this place busy?  So we are seated in 10 minutes as promised. The staff was nice, attentive, did the ""I'll be right back to let you know our specials & get you drinks."" I like that -- acknowledgment goes a long way with me. So we order water, an Arnold Palmer, a Well Behaved Dirty martini (yummy) and for food we get the Santa Fe Salad and the Navajo Sandwich. The food was edible, nothing to jump up and down about, but edible. The bread on my Navajo sandwich was nice and warm, it made me think how nice it would be if I could just eat the bread. The drinks and food came promptly and was nice. I keep wanting to like the Cheesecake Factory, but it seems like I spend most of my time reading advertisements in the MENU, and when I see something I like and want to talk about what I ordered -- I feel like I'm playing Battleship! to explain where this food item is on the menu ... ""Oh, so go to page 18 ... row 36 ... section 4 on the menu so you can see what I'm getting."" And what is with the ADVERTISEMENTS? I feel like I'm at some odd restaurant version of an amusement park. The Coca-Cola in the beverage section isn't enough? You mean you have to try to pimp it for me on what Coca-Cola couples with? People ... it's not a rare 40 yr old vintage bottle of wine that I know nothing about -- it's the stuff we've been drinking all of our lives! OK, OK, I'm crawling off of my soap-box.

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Either my previous bad yelp review came to bite me in the ass, or service here just Â SUCKS whatsoever! Our server is lucky I forgot her name, otherwise I would have reported her to the manager on how forgetful and inattentive she was. When we sat down, I immediately noticed our table was bare. No salt/pepper shakers, no napkins or silverware. uhhh, bussers? hello? To start off, we ordered our drinks. I had ordered a regular Mojito, and my girlfriend ordered a strawberry margarita (not-blended) and two glasses of water. #1. She came back to our table because for some reason the bartender couldn't make my gf's margarita non-blended. Umm okay? So instead the gf ordered a red sangria. THEN she returned to our table and said that they only had white sangria. Okay. About 5 minutes had passed, and still no drinks, no water, NO SILVERWARE OR NAPKINS! Our server finally dropped off our drinks, and still hadn't brought us our waters. #2. So we proceeded to order our food. My gf had asked for a modification on her BLT Salad (no bleu cheese, sub cheddar). I watched our server mumble ""no bleu cheese, sub cheddar"" as she was writing it down. After taking our order, I asked if I could keep a menu with me just in case I wanted to order something more since we were only ordering off the small bites menu. She said okay, and quickly collected ALL the menus and walked away before I could even comprehend what was going on and stop her from taking my menu away. Oh well, whatever.   As we were waiting for our food, our server came and told us that the bread was baking and would be out with a fresh batch in a few minutes. A different server then came out with a few baskets of bread and was dropping them off to other tables around us that had already gotten bread so they declined, but how would our table get missed? Food finally came out, and guess what? BLEU CHEESE ON THE SALAD!! AND NO NAPKINS OR SILVERWARE YET! There was a moment where there were two servers at our table, (one dropping off food, and another finally bringing us our silverware). I sent the salad back instantly. And I also noticed that the server who was dropping off our silverware was placing them directly on the table, without any napkins or anything. Umm excuse me, but I don't know if the table is clean/sanitized or not. After being asked ""can I get you anything else?"" I replied, ""Yeah, we still have no napkins, we didn't get our bread, or our waters.""  I was about to ask our server if she needed a new pair of glasses because of her lack of attention to our table. So our waters finally came, after the food! and bread on our table halfway through our meal. We ate quickly because I was really upset with the lack of attentiveness and the incompetence of the floor staff. IT WASN'T EVEN BUSY!  #3 When I had asked for the check, she gave us the tab for the table to left left of us, I corrected her, and she then gave us the tab to the table to the right of us. WAKE UP B*TCH!!! We finally got our correct bill, paid, and left. And for that horrible experience, I left a 72 cent tip, and walked out quickly.

Apparently, tonight I twisted my order a little too much. I wanted a cream sauce to be made with tomato sauce as well and that warranted the attention of the manager.

Ben H L.,"Santa Clara, CA",303,1561,73,3.0,7/31/2008,"OK so 7/30/08, Wednesday, was $1.50 cheesecake slices at all locations. Â So on most occasions, in a nutshell, the menu is huge, the food is huge, the service is usually very attentive based on the crowdedness, and the wait for a table is usually bad on weekends, and the price is about $20 per person on average for a meal. Â This review is for 7/30/08 and the chaos that occurred at this location. Heading there, I knew I was heading into an atmosphere where the wait time will be long for a table. Â So my friend Viv and I grabbed a pager, reserved our table for 2, went next door to CPK, ate a meal there, and then came back to Cheesecake and surprisingly, our pager never went off...we went from 30th on the list to 5th in about 40 minutes...we were seated quickly and we sat down to our $1.50 slices after waiting about 35 minutes after placing our order with our waiter. Â When the cheesecake did come to our table, I could tell it came out of their freezer recently because the cheesecake was hard, really rock hard...still edible but not soft. Â The people that handle the cheesecake servings were in the shit...orders piling up and no end in sight. Â I felt bad for those guys...they certainly earned their dollars on that night. The policy and rule for the $1.50 slices were dine-in only...yet I saw some people were able to not only order one slice per person to take-out, but also in some cases, order multiple slices to take-out! Â Their policy wasn't enforced very strictly and amidst all the pandemonium from that day, I can certainly understand. Â Will this experience affect if I'll go back? Â Probably not...but I definitely won't be going on a cheap cheesecake promotion night again...if I want frozen dessert, I'd rather get froyo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=700

Since it's been awhile since I've actually eaten at any cheesecake factory, i'd forgotten how many choices there are! this is good and bad, i can be indecisive. (props for huge portions, but do continue reading) I decided to be ""healthy"" and pick the mahi mahi Mediterranean. Â while it tasted pretty good, i was too tired and hungry to really question if my fish was cooked all the way.  he ordered a steak of some sort. but Â the drawbacks: slightly cooked past well done and 2 bites of meat. it would've been nice if they'd mentioned the size of meat they were going to serve. Â  anyway, not too long after getting in the car to go home (we live 5 min down the road) i felt feverish and the tummy was angry! Â I'd only eaten half of my meal and boxed the other half in hopes to snack on it later. Â Epic FAIL. Â if i'd gotten sick from eating the first half, why endure getting sick again with the 2nd? so much for their pride in fresh fish... do keep in mind, i have no problem stomaching my raw sushi.

I have to point out though that we enjoy the service more in the bar section, it feels a little more personable, over in the other areas service is very nice too, but we've always felt that the servers and bartenders at the bar section are most attentive. of course we've been coming here for a while now, but all the familiar faces always greet us and make us feel super welcomed as if it was our first time being there. The managers always say hi too, which is a really nice acknowledgement. For the most part in any business you hardly ever see the managers because they are always hiding in their offices waiting to be called out only when a problem arises, but not here i always catch a manager or two walking the floor greeting and making sure every thing is right. I've never experienced bad customer service here from any of the waiters or waitresses. Besides the great customer service, the food is amazing! I'll anything from the menu. The atmosphere is smooth, elegant, proper, and I love that there's Valet parking right outside!

Â I would suggest always telling your customers if you are out of something and have a suggestion ready for something else. My mom had the Navao sandwich and without bread so she mixed it up like a salad. Â Was quite delicious.

We had to go to the Twilight Release party and we told him and he was doing the best he could to get us all situated and ready to go asap!  The food is prepared better here too. For some reason my macaroni and cheese was a little more not watery, but it had less cheese but it had more flavor than the one at Valley fair. The Avacado eggrolls were hella good too. My coworker ordered a georgia peach & I ordered a mango smoothie. My mango smoothie had more fruit for decoration for some reason than the Vfair location.

Judy C.,"San Jose, CA",245,65,,3.0,8/22/2013,"For a chain, I think Cheesecake Factory is a good place to have a nice catch up with friends or a relaxed date. The mood is casual, not too loud where you have to scream across the table to speak to somebody, and the food is good and shareable. I also like how they have small bites because I like variety and I can never finish my own entree. Pricing is very reasonable and cheesecake can get overwhelming, so, like many people, I encourage you to share a slice. What I've tried so far: -Avacado Egg Rolls: Â If you love avocados, you'll love their avocado egg rolls. You'll get a heaping amount of avocado in your mouth with the first bite!  -Caesar Salad: Can't really go wrong with a salad. Good part about it was that they didn't drench it in dressing. -Mushroom Soup: Tasty but started to taste a little salty at the end. A cup is actually in a bowl so it's good to share if you have an entree coming out. I can only imagine how big the bowl portion is... -Miso Salmon: Sweet honey glaze, flavorful, and delicious! I opted for brown rice. -Salisbury Steak: Too Salty, SKIP! I was craving sauteed mushrooms and caramelized onions that day and didn't want to get a burger (laying low on the carbs). It sounded good but it wasn't. Bleh! Took it home and made a loco moco out of it. -Lemon Chicken: YUM!

I can imagine it taking much longer at normal eating hours, but we were there around 9:45PM. As for the hitting on thing, I was asking her how filling the fried mac and cheese was and she said it was pretty heavy, and I said something like ""I hope so... I'm a hard man to please."" She immediately decided to ask everyone else for their meals instead after being weirded out by that, hah. The food was fine. I got fried mac and cheese which filled me up very well, and at only 9 bucks it was a steal compared to other meals. My friends got different pasta dishes and they all said they were okay, but also felt as if they'd overpaid for them. I got a 'sweetened green tea' as a drink which tasted really good, and thankfully they gave free refills so that was a plus. The key lime cheesecake was also good.

Without them, Cheesecake Factory would be merely a shadow of its current glorious self.  Other recommendations include the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Cajun Chicken Littles, and Baja Chicken Tacos. The lunch specials are hard to beat in terms of the quality/quantity of food served up for the price. The Oakridge Cheesecake delivers consistently better tasting food than the one at Valley Fair.

Connie C.,"Belmont, CA",5000,1539,1424,3.0,8/3/2008,"After two failed attempts at having lunch at Tlaquepaque in Willow Glen, we decided to head over to Oakridge and get a late lunch at Cheesecake. At 2:30, there was no wait, plenty of open booths, and servers were able to be attentive. I'd say, if you can wait to have a late lunch, this is the time to eat here. Let's talk about the frou frou cocktails here first: The Factory Peach Bellini. Remember that. It's blended. And if you like fruity tropical drinks, you'll love this. I want to have a Factory Peach Bellini machine at my house. I could drink these all day. Now the food. You know the menu is as thick as a novel, and there's something for everyone. The three of us shared the fried chicken sliders with fries (remember the Chicken Littles at KFC? Admit it, you liked them too. Well, these are like that, but crispier and more filling) and the chicken quesadillas, which were full lunch sized portions for us. It was so much food, that we ended up taking some home. A slice of cheesecake is always in order here, and we shared the white chocolate macademia nut (very nutty). I have a feeling that if The Cheesecake Factory in Macy's Union Square wasn't such a major tourist trap and was located, say around the corner from Yelp HQ, you'd find me and the Miss Yelps having lunch here a lot.

She then asked if white rice was okay with me, and I said yes. Finally our food arrived. By then a half hour had passed. I took a bite of the chicken, and I couldn't believe it, the chicken tasted like it had been soaked for 2 days in soy sauce. It had such a strong taste!! I told the waitress, and she nicely said if I wanted something else. Of course after waiting for so long I said no. I did not want to wait again. I struggled through the dish, and gave some of the chicken pieces to my friends. They felt the same way I did, it was way to strong of a taste. Very disappointing!!

Totran M.,"San Jose, CA",62,122,54,3.0,3/10/2009,". . . don't be fooled this is not a fine-dining establishment as The Cheesecake Factory would like to believe -- it is a chain and they cut corners to turn as many tables as possible. The cheesecakes and most of the desserts come to the place frozen (""deeply chilled"" as they like to call it), the 'shortcake' for the Strawberry Shortcake dessert is the same biscuit they use for the chicken and biscuits.  For a chain with a menu with 200+ items you're going to have hits and misses. I do like their chicken madeira and they have the best strawberry lemonade I've ever had at any establishment.  Atmosphere: It can be loud on busy nights, if you aren't in a booth you can end up at a banquet sitting too closely to your neighbors, decor is nothing amazing but nicer than other chains, if you sit outside you have a view of the parking lot which can smell like sewer Service: All the staff is trained to give you the best dining experience BUT some servers/hostess don't give a poop. Unfortunately, like many places, the servers will judge you on whether or not you look like a good tipper. If you don't order drinks or appetizer you can pretty much forget being waited on properly. Food: Don't come here for authenticity. Most items on the menu are good and you get HUGE portions -- enough for 2 or 3 meals. Cleanliness: The kitchen is clean and nothing gross. Bathrooms are taken care of by the front desk hostess's -- if its not stocked and clean tell someone at the front desk. Value: If you are willing to wait to be seated I'll say that the food quality and amount served are worth the prices",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=780

Yan G.,"San Francisco, CA",367,485,4,2.0,1/26/2009,"The first time I visited The Cheesecake Factory, I thought it was THE BEST THING EVER! Â Yep, I was walking around Baltimore and stumbled upon this wonderful restaurant. Â The year was 1999. Â Internet stocks were going through the roof, Bill Clinton had his hands full with Ms. Lewinsky, and the Denver Broncos won their second straight Super Bowl. Â Ahh, the good old days. ""We'll fast forward to a few years later And no one knows except the both of us And I have honored your request for silence And you've washed your hands clean of this"" I still don't know what Alanis meant by all this, but it seemed appropriate here. Â Anyway, ten years later I realize that The Cheesecake Factory is not the best thing ever. Â I hadn't been to one of their restaurants in a couple of years . . . Â until yesterday. Â It is still a great place to go with a group of people, because everyone can agree on something. Â Their menus are spiral bound and have ads in them, for G-d's sake! Â It's not a menu, it's a catalog! Â Clearly, they have pretty much everything, since they don't subscribe to the ""do one thing and do it well"" mantra. The food here is fine. Â It's not a compliment, I know, but that's exactly what it is. Â OK. Â Average. Â Run-of-the-mill. Â Decent. Â In a word, fine. Â My dining companion had a burger, and I had the Thai Chicken Pasta, one of my staples when I do visit The Cheesecake Factory. Â As always, the portion was far too large for any normal human being, and it was actually pretty big for me as well. Â The chef certainly did not skimp on the chicken breast slices, peanuts or the Thai sauce. Â The bread and butter basket before the meal also filled me up. We were trying to have a nice conversation, but we were being constantly interrupted by our overly eager waiters. Â Why would you interrupt someone who is clearly in the middle of the conversation? Â More importantly, why would you try to rush your customers? Â I saw plenty of open tables, and not too many hungry customers in waiting. The interruptions, however, did not stop with the waiter. Â An elderly couple, enjoying their lunch at the adjacent table, were getting progressively more annoyed with the lack of available space on their two-top table. Â After a while, they must have thought to themselves: ""we're old and we don't care."" Â So, they grabbed their bread basket and set it on the corner of our four-top table. Â Before I could say anything, two used bread plates made their way onto our table as well. Â I really didn't know what to say or do, because I have this rule about not picking fights with men and women over 70. Â I don't know, I guess that's just the way I was raised. The fact that we managed to have a wonderful time despite mediocre food, sub-par service and inconsiderate patrons is clearly a testament to my dining companion's sense of humor and patience. A word about parking: this is the WORST laid out parking lot I have ever seen. Â It's basically a bunch of one-way streets, left turns and plastic barriers with far too few parking spaces sprinkled in between. Â There's a tendency to over-regulate everything, but I think we can trust people to navigate a parking lot. Â Can't we? Â  Or, is it all just an elaborate scam to get people to valet their cars for $6 a vehicle? Â I am on to you, Oakridge Mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=740

Clarissa Y.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",951,806,992,5.0,6/19/2012,"I have only been here once when I was maybe 11 or 12. The Cheesecake Factory of San Jose only exists to me as a faint memory from 9 years ago and has become almost like one of those amazing dreams that you just cannot get back into. One day, I will take public transportation all the way from Union City just to savour the delicious morsels of food The Cheesecake Factory has to offer again. Ambiance: It has the decor of a classy restaurant and is the perfect place to take a date! I say that when it comes to the dress code, although you wouldn't get turned away for wearing sweatpants you might want to chuck on your Sunday best. Customer Service: Brilliant! The waiter was polite and courteous plus the food came out at reasonable times. Professional, quality service. Food: Even though The Cheesecake Factory looks like it will burn a hole in your wallet, the prices are actually pretty reasonable and standard - nothing different to say your neighbourhood Applebee's. Plus, the food is so AMAZING that it is worth it! I remember ordering a heavenly Smoked Salmon Bagel and I have never enjoyed a bagel more in my life. My dad dug into his Lamb Chops like it was sweet nectar from the gods themselves. Maybe that's the secret of The Cheesecake Factory - they just have stocks and stocks of ambrosia they drip onto all of their meals. Clever bastards, but whatever it is - that faint memory has been a lasting craving for the past 9 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=380

Â If you had GOOD cheesecake in NYC(or dare I say...Chitcago..oops, Chicago..*gags*) Then you will know that it doesn't come out cold, doesn't come out warm. The cheesecake here came out a bit too warm(almost room temperature). It also didn't have the firmness that the good stuff has, and doesn't melt in your mouth like it should. The graham cracker crust is so thin, it's almost non existent, not thick like it should be to hold all the yummy goodness that is sweetened cream cheese.  So you get one star for making my homesickness relieve it's self a bit. The chicken stuffed tortilla...Eh, can't taste the chicken, but you can taste everything else...Had enough flavor, but doesn't hit the spot..Then again I ordered Mexican food at a suburban white persons establishment , you can find better from a taco stand. Will I ever step foot in a cheesecake factory again? Hell no, price doesn't justify it. Thank god it was my GF's sisters birthday or I would do Operation walk out(of course, leaving a tip for the very friendly waiter) However, I know my review wont do diddly squat to their business because people like the place for some unknown reason...So I just killed time at 4 am instead and wrote this silly piece of propaganda.

Whether you come as a single, a couple, or a group, doesn't matter - there's plenty of room for everyone. Â Waitstaff are dressed impeccably in white shirts, black pants and white aprons. Â The decor is stylish and sophisticated. Order a delicious cocktail or wine with your meal, and begin with a thorough reading of the menu.... The menu boasts jaw dropping 10 full pages of mouth-tingling, taste-bud stimulating and mind-boggling sampling of every cuisine from around the world!!! Â Talk about variety and spice! Â Every cuisine imaginable is listed here.... start with some appetizers: Cuban pork mini-bites, Vietnamese Spring Rolls, or Advocado Egg rolls. Entrees are a sampling from The South, New England, Tex-mex, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, South American. Â Whatever region you feel like tasting, there it is.

Jennifer L.,"Cupertino, CA",69,158,8,3.0,2/18/2009,"We lucked out last night with a parking place close to the restaurant. Â This was probably due to the fact that it was a) still raining a little bit; b) a Tuesday night; and c) smack dab in the middle of ski week. Usually, parking is a nightmare at this location with nearby businesses including the theaters and California Pizza Kitchen. Â There is $6 valet parking, so if you are willing to fork over a little dough, you can save yourself some aggravation. Once in the restaurant, it wasn't busy at all. Â (See first paragraph of this review for explanation of this.) Â Usually, the wait at this restaurant is a nightmare. Â You can spare yourself some aggravation by a) not going to The Cheesecake Factory; b) ordering takeout (which also takes care of the parking issue); c) arriving for dinner at around 3:30 in the afternoon. On to the food. Â The portions at this restaurant are huge. Â Past experience has shown that if you eat your meal first, you will never have room for dessert. Â My husband's solution? Â Order dessert first! Â Great. /sarcasm. Â Kudos to our waiter Christian for not making fun of us when we did this. My husband ordered three slices: Â Oreo Cookie Cheesecake, Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake, and Mud Pie cake. Â The good news is that my three stepsons joined us with their appetites. Â The boys devoured the cake like army ants over a cow carcass. Â I blinked and the dessert was gone. Â Probably better for my waistline. Â  I can't tell you how the Oreo Cookie Cheesecake was. Â I didn't even get a bite of that. Â Curses to you, Ryan! Â The Mud Pie Cake and the Chocolate Mousse cake were delicious, with the latter being my favorite: smooth, creamy and chocolaty. We didn't have huge appetites after dessert first and the little ones quickly felt the effects of our first course like a junkie who has just mainlined crank. Â They were bouncing in their seats from the sugar rush. I ordered the Endive, Pear and Blue Cheese salad. Â It was crisp, flavorful and delicious with lots of blue cheese and not too much dressing. Â The kids split an order of sliders. Â They were really greasy. Â As far as sliders go, you'll do better at Chili's. Â  One of my stepsons ordered Rigatoni Arrabbiata. Â He probably should have read the description better. Â It has red pepper flakes in it and it was really spicy. Â Not just spicy by his or my husband's standards (they are wimps in this regard) but spicy by my standards. Â The waiter offered to correct this by putting Parmesan cheese on top. Â This didn't fix it (der), so they replaced it with a less spicy version. Â  The other end of the table ordered chicken nachos, which were tasty. Â  It is a pretty rare occasion when our family decides to eat out at The Cheesecake Factory. Â I think the bottom line is that the food isn't so great to make it worth the hassle and wait.

Â Freaking $4 for a drink, are you kidding me? Very little here is vegetarian. Â I ordered the morning quesadilla without the bacon, as that was the only ingredient that screamed meat. The server had the wherewithall to come back and ask - although it's not listed on the description for some reason, it also has chorizo. Â Okay, no chorizo. Â Then he comes back again. Â The black beans? Â They're made with chicken stock. Â Come on now, is that really necessary? Alright, so he offers to replace the beans with a vegetable. Â I choose the broccoli. When my entree comes, there is no broccoli to be found. Â Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty, but why ask about a substitute if you're not actually going to use it? I also noticed it had no ""tomato cream sauce"" as listed in the description. Â I'm assuming this is because that too had chicken stock in it, but nobody said anything about it, it was just not there. The sides (guacamole, salsa, sour cream) all tasted fresh and were a nice complement to the meal. Â However, they were not included in my take-home box with my leftovers! Â Bummer. Â This is why I prefer to box my own, thanks. Â I pay that much for a meal, I want ALL of the meal. Cheesecake Factory may taste good, but it is regularly overpriced, and unnecessarily antivegetarian, so I carry a grudge. Â I used to love the corn tamale appetizer until I found out those had chicken stock too, and while I don't know for sure, even the bread tasted like it had been basked with some sort of bacon juice.

The minus 1 star is for their take out. One experience we had in the curbside service was horrible. We order one slice of cheesecake and they told us it would be 10-15 minutes, which was fine because we had to drive there. I called in telling them I was there providing my name, car make and color. Then waited another 20 minutes till I finally went inside to find the take out staff just standing around doing nothing. I asked them how long the cheese cake had been done and they said about 20 minutes. Funny I had been waiting 20 minutes outside for you guys to come out.

My boyfriend also had the potato soup, it is kind like a loaded bake potato soup, which was good but it was missing sour cream. My boyfriend got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta which was good but the sauce was a bit thin for my liking. I had their ceasar salad. I love their ceasar salad and i just get the smaller portion with no chicken and I have that as my meal because it is huge and trust me I am not exaggerating. The way they make their ceasar dressing is different from any other place I have it. It is super garlicy and that is what I love most about it.

Tran M.,"San Jose, CA",111,31,8,1.0,2/22/2010,"I've been going to The Cheesecake Factory Â in Valley Fair for a long time and usually leave very satisfied with the food and service. Sunday night was my little cousin's birthday and he wanted to go there for their infamous cheesecakes. Â Since this one is a bit closer to my house compared to the one in Valley Fair, I decided to check it out. It took about 40 minutes for us to be seated and we were told it would take half the time. They didn't even give me the device thingy so I kept coming back and forth asking if our table were ready. Once we were seated, drinks and bread were quickly served (That's what the 1/2 star is for, though the white bread were stale ). I told them it was my cousin's birthday so we're gonna get some cheesecake afterward. The first waiter seemed nice and clear (another 1/2 star) . Then the food came out and everything went bad from there. My cousin's pasta with alfredo sauce from the kid's menu was way overpriced ! $6.95 for a plate of bow-tie pasta with sauce and NOTHING else! Come on, I know they're kids but kids can eat meat too! Poor little cousin. She looked really disappointed so I had to give her some chicken from my plate. Â My Chicken Marsala wasn't much better. The bow-tie pasta was undercooked, chicken was not well seasoned and the whole plate just taste sooo bland that I had to request extra sauce. So being an Asian woman who was unsatisfied with her food, I attacked other people's plates and nothing were good. All the foods tasted way way WAYYYY too sweet. My boyfriend's steak from Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combination were the smallest pieces of steak I've seen. hahaha They were cute but did not taste good! Â the Pasta Da Vinci were again undercooked (chicken were okay). I remember them taste way better at the one in Valley Fair.. =( Then while we were eating, our server came over and said that some other guy (forgot his name) was gonna take over. Anyways, everyone seemed to stop eating after 15 minutes (cuz the food wasn't good) and just sat there for like 15 minutes. No one cared to come and check on us or clean up our plates. Â I had to flag down a different waitress who happened to walked by! It took her 5 minutes to get our waiter and it took him another 5 minutes to bring out the dessert menu. He suggested what's good for dessert, told me to think and disappeared into thin air after cleaning up our plates for another 15 minutes. Are you for real? I got angry and again flag down another waitress to bring me my bill!! She brought out the bill and left. It came out to be $152.50, 18% tip already included! (We had 2 appetizers: fried calamari and crispy crab wonton, 4 adult-sized orders and 2 orders from the kids menu for the 3 kids to share!!). Tips were $21.25. Gosh, I wished I could take it off. Anyways, back to the problem! After I signed my bill, I waited, and waited and waited.... for SOMEBODY to come over and swipe my card Â so I can just LEAVE the damn place! But noooooo!!! My wish was not granted!  So finally, I had to drag my lazy butt to the counter, threw the damn bill in their face (not literally) and told them I wanted to pay for the meal! Then I angrily walked back to my table, sat down, expecting at least an apology from someone. HELL NO! I expected too much!  Another 2-3 minutes passed by and our ""nice and attentive NOT"" waiter FINALLY came over and asked me what we want for dessert! Are you KIDDING ME? Dessert? NOW? OMFG!! I wanted to slap him in the face but the bf was there so I had to be lady-like and said ""I paid already"". The waiter was shocked to hear that!! -__- He was like ""uh okay! Let me get your card!""  No apologies were ever said! From the waiter, the guy at the counter or the manager! At least they still remember my cousin's birthday so when we were about to leave, they brought out a sundae (the smallest sundae I ever seen) and sang a happy birthday song.  But that did not make feel better. I will never ever come back to this place again!

The night resumed with pretty good service, but after we finished our meal, we waited for about 20 minutes for a bill. Our server had disappeared unexpectedly, and then a hostess (I assume since she was wearing all black clothing instead of all-white) picked up the slack, she was friendly and prompt with delivering/retrieving our bill/payment, she offered us dessert and was genuinely sweet.

Maybe my family is lucky but we never have to wait to long, even on this crowed day we waited only about 10 minutes. Knock on wood! The food range from delicious to mediocre. But the majority of the meals I tried have been Â delicious! Food I recommend: Thai Lettuce Wraps: like a chicken taco with butter-lettuce as the wraps,it comes with 3 different sauce and moist flavorful chicken. Factory Chopped Salad -is my go to salad here, everything about it is delicious! Miso Salmon: Yummy! My only complaint is I want more of it, this dish tends to disappear the quickest! Cause its that good! Mahi Mahi Mediterranean: We were hesitant to order it, and surprisingly it was good. This dish comes with a huge potion of mash-potatoes.  Hibachi Steak: nicely marinated, and cut in the strips and cooked the way you like it. This dish also comes with a large portion of mash-potatoes, my family usually substitute one of the mash-potatoes portion, cause two portions of it is way too much. Pass on the Garlic Noodles, average compare to everything else I tried. Cheese cakes love them all!  Overall the service range from average to great! *** Manager extremely kind, there was a coupon for every $30 you spend, you get a free slice of cheese cake.

My friend warned me that it wasn't a 'huge' meal. It also didn't resemble goulash. It was overcooked meat in an unrecognizable brown sauce with gummy noodles. The others were not as disappointed in their meals as I was. When the time came I eagerly ordered the '6 carb cheescake'. I can't eat sugar so it's a treat for me to get a dessert I can eat. They were out. They offered to sell me a whole cheesecake, frozen. Â I didn't want to buy a whole cheesecake without trying a slice, so I declined.

Erin O.,"Neighbors Southwest, Beaverton, OR",85,643,59,3.0,7/22/2006,"I find the menu overwhelming. It's a novel! I prefer restaurants that focus on a few really good things than restaurants that try to be everything to everyone. It's just a recipe to fail.  -I've had the BANG-BANG CHICKEN AND SHRIMP thai dish. Sometimes too spicy for me, but when not...it's got good flavors with the expected vegetables, curry, peanuts, etc over rice. -Several times I've ordered HERB CRUSTED FILET OF SALMON served over mashed potatoes with asparagus and a lemony sauce. -The BEST thing on the menu is the AVOCADO EGGROLLS--light and flaky (not greasy or tightly wrapped like other ""eggrolls"") and filled with avocado and other goodies, served with a sweet tamarind dipping sauce.  My complaints? -No kiddie menu! They have 500 pages (yes, exaggerating) of menu items, yet no kid portions/prices and no coloring crayons to entertain the younger set -I hate the ""wait by the palm tree"" queue for seating people. You get a pager, sit and wait, then get called to a wall by a palm tree and wait more, then you get seated. -The menu items are expensive (for this type of restaurant) so even though my favorite thing is the avocado eggroll appetizer, it's really not affordable to then order an entree as well. Plus, portions are so huge, who can eat all that?   Lower the prices, portions, and offerings and it'd be a better place.  I've been to the Oakridge location as well as Valley Fair and one above Macys at Union Square.

I've been here quite a few times and the last time I went here recently the bread was my most favorite part of the meal. The atmosphere here is great. It is usually dimly lit like many higher end restaurants and it probably is a little more expensive than your average sit-down, but that's why you get better service and food. The prices are usually around 12-16$ per dish, but they do have cheaper dishes during lunch time around 10$. I always love getting the brown Â sweet-ish tasting bread of which is still don't know the name! The waiters are always freindly enough to give me more than the usual amount when I ask for it too. I would say my favorite dishes from here are the Chicken Tacos and the Meatloaf. The meatloaf is always very juicy and the potatoes complement it perfectly along with the corn. As for the chicken tacos, they are always arranged nicely and again, the servers will give you a little bit of extra sides if you ask politely.

Â ""then why did you say you did?"", ""the kitchen doesn't even know how to make that, if you want to tell us how, i'll see if they can do it"".....""that's not gonna work, can she have fries instead?"".... a few minutes later, as we were waiting for her fries, we started to eat and as she tasted my food, I saw her pull something out of her mouth. Â it was A GODDAM PIECE OF PLASTIC!!! WTF?!!! Â If that was someone's kid, they could've choked on that! Â Fries came out, I told the server (who was nice although she smelled like so much smoke I felt like I caught lung cancer from her) that I think it's time for me to speak with the manager. Â When she went to get him, I tried the fries that she JUST brought out and they were cold! Â Manager came, obviously embarrassed. Â ""I'm so sorry, I heard what happened""....""yea, I think we're ready to leave"" I explained the spinach, plastic bag, and fries problems and he said, ""can I at least explain where the plastic bag came from"".....""I don't really care where it came from, I think we're ready to leave""......""can I at least make you something to take with you""....""With all that's happened so far, I don't think it'll get any better, and we don't really feel comfortable (or safe) eating here"".....""ok, I won't charge you for your meals"".....""of course you won't, cuz that wouldn't make sense"". Â He actually did handle it really well and after refusing his offer of a gift card, we left. Experience 3 - It had been a few months and I was craving a damn burger, so we decided to give them another chance. Â Waited 45 minutes to be seated. Â We ordered clam chowder and TexMex Eggrolls. Â Clam chowder was fine, but the eggrolls were cold. Â probably because theywere sitting there for 1/2 hour while after we ordered (total time so far 1 1/2 hours). Â about 20 minutes later, my Well done Kobe Burger came, but her Ahi Carpachio didn't. Â So We waited....and waited.....and waited. Â  The waiter (who was very good at his job) noticed I was getting really annoyed, so he brought the manager without me asking. Â Manager apologized and I asked him why a RAW dish is taking longer than a WELL DONE dish? Â he said that if we wait a little longer it'll be there. Â ""WE'VE BEEN HERE 2 HOURS ALREADY!!""......""i apologize, and I promise i'll make it up to you"". Â Fish came out a few minutes later (total time 1 hour 55 minutes). Â They comp'd desert, but that wasn't enough to make up for them dropping the ball. Â  Staff is good here, management is good, kitchen needs a suprise visit from the health inspector to get them back on track and paying attention, and their procedures need an internal audit with some better organization.

However, I was quite pleased that we only had to wait 20 Â minutes for a table during peak dinner time. They sat us along the booths near the bar. I was completely fascinated by the mirrors that ran above the booths. It allowed you to keep up with conversation and eye contact while watching the TVs at the bar! Well done designers! It's a win-win for all parties b/c you are either looking at the monitors from the mirrors or the TVs directly if you are on the other side of the table. I'm not a huge sports fan but I couldn't help myself and found that I was keeping up with the baseball scores. I could tell it was starting to annoy my friend.

Does anyone remember when there was just one Cheesecake factory in San Francisco above Macy's that took pride on amazing customer service? Well, sadly as the franchise expanded they lost their touch. Here is my story: Went to Cheesecake Factory with the Misses for a romantic dinner with friends on new year's eve. Told 30 minute wait and given a beeper, ended up waiting an hour. It's cool it's new years eve. Standing room only waiting for the beeper to go off, but good company made up for it. Seated and was promptly take care of by an amazing server, ""Rod"". Then ""Rod"" went on break leaving ""Steve"" in charge of our table. Our food arrived and one of the people in our party wanted soy sauce and didn't get it. Our drinks ran dry. Where was Steve? Steve was no where to be seen? Steve? Steve was in ""his"" section on the other side of the restaurant. Finally, 15 minutes past and everyone had pretty much finished our did ""Steve"" show up. Water came. Soy sauce came, but Management shouldn't have left our table in the care of someone that already had another area and was too busy to take care of us. Food was amazing. ""Rod"" when there did an amazing job! ""Steve"" took it down from a 4 star experience down to a 3.

Â Our waitress greeted us right away and was very nice. Â The noise level was fine by me (my noisy 2 year old blended in without being noticed) and the atmosphere was pleasant and lively. Â We've been to Cheesecake Factory before so I was familiar with the menu. Â My daughter got the pepperoni pizza (I wish they had a kids' menu for more choices), hubby got the Steak Diane & Scampi combo, grandma got the Grilled Chicken Medallions, and I got the Chicken Madeira & Salmon combo. Â Everything was delicious! Â We even ordered the Chocolate Mousse cheesecake for dessert. Â It was decadent! Â One complaint is that the entree portions seem to be smaller than before. Â We've been eating at this restaurant for a few years now and in the last year I've noticed the portions getting smaller. Â So I'm giving Cheesecake Factory 4 stars due to smaller portion size, lack of a kids' menu and difficult parking. Â Other than that I'm still recommending them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-jose?start=960
