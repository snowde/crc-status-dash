Carmen M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",23,51,7,4.0,3/21/2011,My friend and I went to The Cheesecake Factory on a busy Sunday. The place was packed and we thought we might have to wait. Since it was only the two of us we waited for 15 minutes. We were quickly seated to a nice table.  A waiter named Renee asked us for drinks in a timely manner. I had the Portabella Mushroom burger with no cheese (vegan here) and my friend had the pull apart pork sandwich.  My burger was delicious but my friend's pork had alot of fat in it (pork?) The service was great and the restaurant was well organized. I would go back in a minute.  I would also want Renee for dessert next time!  Hmmmm! Did I say that?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1180

Stine H.,"San Francisco, CA",201,478,198,4.0,8/3/2009,"As a franchise, I consider cheesecake factory quite satisfactory.  They have a vast menu of all kinds of food to choose from. And of course, being called ""cheesecake"" factory, they do offer a diverse menu of cheesecakes. Being a large american franchise restaurant though, you can expect to wait quite a bit to be seated. BUT if you come in late enough there wouldn't be much of a wait anymore... I especially like their little appetizer menu which isn't too shabby. There are a few different things to choose from there and the price ain't to bad for a nice little serving. Their fried zuchini is pretty tasty. Anyhow, I don't consider the prices too bad, and the portions are good. You'll probably be saving a lot of money by picking a few things and sharing it with another person. Afterall, these portions are meant for one person alone...obsesity! Oh, my favorite cheesecake is their fresh banana cream.

Archie G.,"San Jose, CA",1118,1026,42,2.0,1/9/2009,"Going to the restroom at this location is so dangerous. You have walk through this kitchen area that is super slippery. I always feel as I am going to fall. I keep expecting to fall on my ass, but it never happens. But I keep expecting it. I wonder if that means anything? Anyway, how can a restaurant with a menu several pages long that has approximately 239 food choices, have so little to offer? The food here is always uninspired. While the food is disappointing, the prices make it even worse. I have friends you who keep dragging me here, so I keep trying different things on the menu. In the end, I feel as if I they are taking stuff out of a freezer, warming it up, and putting it up on my plate. The servers annoy me as well. Every single time I order something, they have to remark how that is a good choice and how delicious that particular entree is. And then it comes out and I am forcing myself to swallow. So yeah, I do not appreciate liars. Nor do I appreciate this restaurant. Or it's crappy cheesecake.

Marissa F.,"San Jose, CA",57,93,6,3.0,1/6/2009,"Several months ago, my mom and sister came to stay with me for the weekend. We worked up quite an appetite after meandering around Valley Fair and I thought it would be nice to treat them to a descent meal before their trek back to the Central Valley. And it was perfect because my brother came to join our mall excursion and we'd all be able to dine together. I suggested The Cheesecake Factory since they'd never been there before and because my mom is a cheesecake lover. We were seated promptly and arrived just in time to take advantage of the lunch portion options. We ordered 2 lunch portions of pasta with shrimp and 2 cheeseburgers. When our dishes arrived, we were given 3 pasta dishes and 1 cheeseburger...... Me: Excuse me, we ordered 2 cheeseburgers and 2 pasta dishes. Server: Uh, no you ordered 3 pasta dishes. That's why I asked you if you wanted a lunch portion. Me: (Looking around at my family in confusion) Didn't you hear me order a burger? Mom: Yeah. Sister: (Being such a sweetheart) It's okay, I'll just have the pasta. And the server never apologized or offered to fix the error. Instead of being too proud and/or lazy, she should have insisted on correcting her mistake. I was pissed. Two days passed and I was still pissed. I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager, explaining what had happened. She apologized for our server's behavior, said that's not how their staff is trained and that never should have happened. She took my address and sent me a $50 gift card, bumping my 2 star rating up to 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1180

Depending on what you  like . The last time I went I had the red velvet.  I must say this is to die for.  I love it more than those red velvet cupcakes. Its not too sweet its just right.

And the saucy goodness was excellent. Also, the chicken was moist, shrimp were plump, and sausage added good flavor. Also, a friend's sandwich took a long time to come, and when it came, we realized the chicken was not fully cooked. Later the waiter came back and apologized and said the manager would be over to talk to us. Manager was right on his heels and apologized. Then later on the manager came back to bring the order.

Natalie C.,"Cupertino, CA",299,8,3,2.0,1/13/2011,"Went here with my friend for a late dinner on Wednesday night. Normally cheesecake factory is our first choice for late night food for nights that we work late because of the super-friendly service. This was the first time they really disappointed us. We sat down in the bar area and after about fifteen minutes a server walks up and says ""Oh, well here is one menu, I'll go get one more."" He had a strangely rude, monotonous kind of voice. He came back after a couple minutes with another menu and said something about specials and soup, but I couldn't make out one word to the next he was speaking so quickly. Oh, well! He sort of hovered by the bar looking in our direction for a while and then skipped over to our table and said, ""Oh yeah, did you guys want something to drink? Maybe water or something?"" Um, hi. BAR AREA. Normally at cheesecake factory we're asked every five minutes or so if we want another drink. Gotta make money somehow, I suppose.  We went through with our order and a really sweet girl brought it out. She was probably the highlight of our night. She was super friendly and made it seem like she actually wanted to get us what we wanted. We weren't sure when we'd see our server again so we asked her for extra everything!  My friend got the tex mex eggrolls, which I liked but he thought they were pretty average. We'll stick to cheap chili's over those. The worst part though, I got the ""nachos with spicy chicken"" spicy? No. Flavor? No. Temperature? Right out of the fridge. Along with the rest of the nachos.. I've had nachos all over the place, but not once have I been served cold chicken on cold chips with unmelted cheese. Weird. So I ate around the edges until we caught sight of our server maybe five minutes later. I don't think I was rude to him, I just asked if they could heat it up a little because everything was still cold. He told me ""I'm so sorry about that, don't worry I'll get it fixed and take it off of your check."" Welp. I wasn't expecting to get it free, just warm at least. ANOTHER ten minutes go by and he brings out a new plate of nachos and says that he had them make a whole new plate for me. Unnecessary, but nice. Would've been nicer if half the chips weren't burned to black. Don't mess with people making your food is the lesson I've learned. To top it all off, the check came out and I was charged twice for the nachos and one of them was comp'ed off. I called him over and asked why there was a second charge and he mumbled back that he had to put it in the computer twice and charge me twice. After he had told me I wouldn't have to pay for them, I was a little confused, but he made himself sparse until he came back to pick up the signed receipt.  Disappointing to say the least for cheesecake factory. Moral of the story? If you get stuck at Joshua's table, run!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1180
Eric K.,"Dublin, CA",45,1116,9,2.0,5/30/2007,"Any one read Fast Food Nation? This is the kinda place that they talk about from the standpoint that the portions get bigger to help justify the prices that they charge. The quality of the food is in line with places such as Chili's, TGIFs, Applebees....  wrap it in a setting where they have spongepainted walls and pillars and stuff, add 50% and make you wait 3x as long.... that's what the Cheese-house comes out to be. These places are perfect examples of the ""yes, we're busy, so you can wait, and you'll like it."" They don't take reservations, and they won't seat large groups until the last seating of the night, then they'll give poor service, because they already lock-in their 20% gratuity for parties 6 or more.  but they try to compensate by throwing a free appetizer at you which prolly costs them like $1.00 to make even though they are gonna make a killing on everything else.

Stephanie Y.,"San Jose, CA",24,61,,4.0,6/28/2010,"ahh. Cheesecake Factory.  With a menu that could pass as a short novel, I find that I order the same things because it would take just too darn long to find a new dish.  I often order pastas here because the portions are huge and they're so tasty. The downside is that many of the dishes are packed with calories, so if you're trying to watch your weight, share the dishes with friends, or wait to visit this place. In general, whether it's pasta, or salad, or something different, their portions are very hearty, and probably worth two meals for a female, and enough to stuff a male. I absolutely love the complimentary bread, warm and fresh from the oven. Two kinds-but everyone knows the brown bread is better than the sour dough (at least in my opinion).  My favorite dish has got to be the Chicken Bellagio. It's a really good deal, with hearty portions at a lower price than some of their regular menu pastas. The chicken is lightly breaded and moist, with a bed of pesto pasta sitting in a light cream sauce. It's topped off with fresh arugula and large pieces of prosciutto. All in all a great combination of flavors.  This place can get very busy at night, especially on the weekends, and you can't make reservations without a larger party (around 8 or 10 people), so I'd get here early if you can. I've waited an hour to eat here with only a party of two. But the bread is just so good...it was worth the wait. Stephs' Recommendations: Chicken Bellagio (it's on the Specials Menu, so you won't find this on their regular menu) Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1320
Naomi Y.,"Los Gatos, CA",666,206,904,5.0,11/1/2008,"Pros: I have never gotten bad service here. The appetizer platter is delish. I LOVE LOVE the Chicken Madeira, Hibachi Steak, and  Mahi Mahi Mediterranean.  Some of my other favorites are the Miso Salmon, The Jambalaya with extra sauce, and Scampi (the prawns are huge!), and the Tuna Tataki Salad, and their version of a philly cheesesteak is very flavorful and the bread is perfect!  Their mashed potatoes (thank God!!) are fresh and creamy! I love their complimentary bread too; Sourdough and wheat (love the wheat). You can even buy the loaf of bread for 7 bucks. Desserts: The Tiramisu Cake (NOT CHEESECAKE!) is the BEST I have EVER HAD..... The Next best desserts are the pumpkin cheesecake, Dulce De Leche cheesecake, Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake, Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and I love the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake!!! mmmmhmmm!!! So 5 stars easy because service, quality, and those two things are worth the price! Also, this place is consistent. Cons: The parking can really suck at the Valley Fair Mall location. It's a frenzy looking for a parking spot on a regular day! BUT when Christmas is around the corner just go to the valet and get your ticket validated to save you some 20-40 minutes of scarce parking frenzy.  Floor can be really slippery, so watch out ladies in your stilettos Lastly, they DON'T take reservations EVEN for LARGE parties. WALK INS ONLY and the WHOLE party or MORE than Half the party has to be there to GET SAT... SIGH.. Also, if the party is more than 2 then the wait is at minimum 45 minutes at dinner time. At lunch time I typically get sat right away or wait maybe 10 minutes max. Have a friend run in and put your name on the wait list as you search for a spot. Pretty much this place is consistent with the pros and cons.

Freshfoeonefifth S.,"Fremont, CA",303,4,3,2.0,6/6/2013,"First time here and probably will never return. I heard great things only to discover otherwise. My twin sister picked this place for our 25th birthday because she knows I love Jambalaya Pasta. I eat a lot with my family so we tend to fine in large groups. Cheesecake Factory seemed accommodating. But upon arrival we were told to wait for a manager just for a quote wait time. The wait was less than about ten minutes until we were seated. But there were no formal greetings just wait . We were surprised at to be seated because we were under the impression that we were waiting for a superior. The waiter/waitress were not attentive. I noticed that they would take 2-3 orders at a time and jump from person to person. It took them 20 minutes to bring me my beer. That's 20 minutes AFTER all other beverages and appetizers were served. Not only did they lag on my beer, I waited yet another 20 minutes for my pasta. All the while my entire party were at the end of their dish. The jambalaya pasta was a complete fail. Not only because oft experience at the time but because it genuinely lacked all the authentic flavors. The added chicken was bland and tasteless. The Cajun shrimp was boring. The taste uneventful in any way . The vegetables undercooked. Also, I hate the fact that restaurants like such charge a higher percentage ""gratuity fee"" when their Hospitality does not justify such demand. They are not fit to accommodate a larger paying party. 15 people with No room an second to none eating space. When I see 2-6 parties eat with lounge luxury. So, in conclusion: I was very Very Excited and Eager to try Cheescake Factory for the very first time. But to no avail. I hope people can appreciate the constructive Criticism.

I ordered my absolute favorite, the avocado egg rolls with the sublime tamarind sauce.  Once in a while, when they get it just right, it's almost orgastic.  Unfortunately, tonight wasn't one of those nights.  But, it's still good.  My other favorite is the quesadilla with chicken.  It's so simple, but the melted cheese in the warm tortilla just goes down so nice with the guacamole, salsa, and sour cream toppings.    Overall, it was fantastic as usual.  The warm molasses bread always hits the spot.  I always feel warm and fuzzy afterwards, even if it's followed quickly by food-coma.  The portions are very decent considering their target clientele, who are usually size 12+ peeps and skinny, bottomless pit guys like me.  By little Asian girl standards, the plates are huge.  Even for me, I can only manage to handle two appetizers and a pasta plate.  I rarely make it to dessert unless I specifically went there for a night cap.   So, that was it for this stop.  My aim for the night was variety for my guests so we hopped on over to Thea Mediterranean to finish off the night.  I'll be back again soon enough and probably to hit the appetizers on happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1140

When the check came, each person only had to pay 8-10 bucks which is very cheap.  Appetizer:  Calamari- crispy and came with two types of sauce. Good but the batter seems to fall apart a little bit. (Still recommended to get it) Entrees: Four cheese pasta and I believe the chipotle pasta: Pretty delicious, the first dish came out and the pasta was undercooked so we told the waiter and he made sure that they made us another dish right away. He also double checked on us when the dish came out a second time to make sure that it was up to par with our liking.  Dessert: The red velvet cheesecake: I was skeptical about this at first because many red velvet cakes that I've tried are dry, but this cheesecake is perfect.

Ngoc P.,"San Jose, CA",107,85,69,4.0,12/29/2017,"Back to the basics  My true rating is a 3.5 but since there's no option for that, I picked 4(rounding it up). Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. There is nothing too special but it has what I need. I usually come here for two things : happy hour and pasta da vinci. No matter where I go, I always come back to pasta da vinci. It's just one of those heavy and comfort foods that I gravitate towards once in a while.  Pasta Da Vinci - creamy pasta with chicken & mushrooms. It has a nice creamy consistency without it being too overwhelmingly rich. Tamales - savory with a little bit of sweentness which makes a good combination of yumminess. Buffalo wings - just your typical wings. It's nothing special but it's good. Chicken sliders - same, nothing special but good. Parking can be b****. Especially when it's close to valleyfair. Those who have been here during the holidays know how crowded it can get and finding a parking space can be challenging unless you're willing to do valet or pay 5$ to park in their small lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2
Jason M.,"San Jose, CA",114,217,246,4.0,1/5/2018,"Really only 2 things that aren't fun when coming to Cheesecake Factory, 1. The wait  2. The parking So many good things about this place, food, desert, appetizers, bread, butter, drinks.  It's all good.   I like to be seated near the back, it tends to be more intimate and private.  The lighting here is good, flow goes well once your seated.   I enjoy  Ribeye steak - it's a great cut marbled and juicy seasoned well, the mashed potatoes are sweet light and delicious, veggies are almost never over cooked like most places.   Seared tuna - sometimes you get a great piece sometimes you don't it's a hit or miss on this dish for me.   Glazed salmon - same as tuna, but usually cooked nicely and moist.   Kobe burger - awesome, just awesome.  When you look at the menu as if the choices are just overwhelming, go for the burger and your good to go.  Juicy, drizzly, and delicious.   Cheesecake galore take your pick and eat up.   Martini -  they make a mean martini, just great here.   Get past that wait and enjoy a nice dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2

CeeJay F.,"San Jose, CA",662,21,90,5.0,12/28/2017,"Just wanted to start my review by giving Jaimie a big big ""Thank You!"" for her excellent service tonight on my parent's anniversary dinner. Very patient with us, asked if we had any questions with the menu, and checked in time to time to see if we needed anything after getting our food.  Thank you for going above and beyond by making my parents a little Happy Anniversary dessert plate after you guys said you usually don't, only for birthdays. I really appreciate it so much that you made it happen. It made our whole dining experience tonight an amazing one, ending it on a high note. I always get the combo items every time I come here because you get two items for around $23 and it's really not a bad deal at all. It's a great selection of combos and it gets you pretty full.  But I thought I'd try something new tonight...and when I asked about the Miso Salmon, Jaimie pretty much sold it to me and I'm really glad that I ordered that tonight. I'm happy to have found my second favorite dish to get there besides the combos, the first one being the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. I think it's wonderful that you have an option of brown rice as well which is what I got with my Miso Salmon dish. The brown rice wasn't dry and was not too moist either, it was perfect. The salmon itself was great! Perfectly cooked, complemented well with the sauce on the sides all around the plate. I paired the rice and the sauce because it tasted so good. Haha. Plating was very appealing! (I recommend this dish if anyone wants to try something new within the Salmon area) For you with venturous taste buds, my little brother got the Macaroni and Cheese Burger. It's actually pretty good! He says it's cheesy and the patty was cooked perfectly (medium well). It sure will get you full and it comes with a side choice of fries and I believe the other choice was salad? I might be wrong. But this was another really great dish!  My cousin ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Portion was good! He said it was pretty spicy! It had green pasta, the shrimp was peeled and it didn't have a tail, so it was easy to eat! It also came with chicken and the chicken was tender itself. Another dish he recommends to get if you're looking for anything in the pasta area! The environment is just like any other Cheesecake Factory, a little dark and intimate. Taking pictures is a little hard, but nothing a flash can fix. The wait also varies on what day you go and time. But it is worth the wait! Next time I'll make room for cheesecake! Haha. Thank you again Jaimie for your amazing service! Be sure to ask for her if you have the chance to! I definitely will when I come back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2

The only bad thing I have to say about this place is their front desk. They're always so rude here! They do not greet, smile, or say thank you. First impressions are everything and this always makes my visit so uncomfortable.  About the food: I'm loyal to one dish and one dish only. The garlic chicken farfalle  is hands down the best pasta dish they have here. That's the only thing I ever order when i visit TCF. Love how they have fresh grated parmesan as well..  They also serve complementary sour dough and brown bread with butter. So good!!! I always get full before my entree comes out.

Cindy M.,"San Jose, CA",197,338,856,3.0,9/19/2017,"Another birthday meal at TCF, this time dinner. Monday night and the wait was only 10 minutes. Our server Adeline wasn't the most enthusiastic, but was friendly. We'd later find out that she was slightly forgetful. Not trying to be hard on her but I'm going to be honest and give 3 stars instead of 4 stars for this visit. I would recommend that empty plates be removed when your server comes to the table. That wasn't done initially. Later in the meal it was.  For starters, our group had the eggroll sampler. Loved two out of the four (firecracker and salmon). Moving on to the chicken sliders deluxe. There were four large sliders with a side of fries. This alone would probably be good if you were here for drinks and appetizers. We weren't about to stop there, not this time. Onto the entrees. Birthday guest had Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms. As you know, the portions are huge so half was packed up the next day. Second meal was the Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger which was enjoyed thoroughly by a burger-holic. Nice combo of bacon topped with pork belly. They barely finished it. Third meal was the surf & turf w/ Steak Diane Salmon combo w/ asparagus. Asked for med-rare on both fish and steak, but it was slightly overcooked in my opinion. The Steak Diane was okay. Salmon was good.  Both red wines I had were tasty. However, the Lyric Pinot Noir was better than the red blend. Finally, dessert was on the radar. During our dinner we heard about six birthday songs so we were in good company. Our server had a buddy come over to help her sing and our group joined in of course. The birthday guest was presented with a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake decorated nicely with the typical hot-fudge birthday wish written on the plate, colorful sprinkles, mounds of whipped cream and a birthday candle. It was oh so good. Light and creamy. Kids hot fudge sundae was good as well.  TCF is still the most diverse menu for your dining experience. Does it always knock your taste buds out of the park...? No, not really, but you can satisfy any craving nonetheless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2
Shaun H.,"San Jose, CA",160,263,293,3.0,11/4/2017,"If there's a restaurant on the planet with a larger selection of menu items than The Cheesecake Factory I would be surprised.  The waitress placed a tome in front of each of us, it made a heavy thud.  Reading it was a project, decisions, decisions.  We needed more time, so we ordered drinks, a classic stall tactic.  Then a couple appetizers:  dynamite shrimp and cuban rolls. Finally we ordered.  I had chicken madeira.  My three dining partners had jambalaya pasta, salmon and hibachi steak.  The drinks and appetizers came quickly.  The dynamite shrimp were tiny fried shrimp with some slightly spicy dipping sauce.  Meh.  The Cuban rolls were an egg roll cut in half, stuffed with shredded pork, ham, melted cheese and some pickle-mustard sauce.  Cuban sandwich fillings in an eggroll?  Some fusion is bomb, this was a bit of a dud.  Not bad but not fantastic. Our main courses took a long long time.  I'm sure it's hard for the kitchen to support such a large menu.  So many things to cook.  My chicken madeira was burnt on the bottom, not charred, burnt.  It took me a few bites to get past that, but he sauce was decent.  My dining partners all reported that their entrees were ""ok."" We all ordered cheesecake to go.  I had my strawberry cheesecake later that night and it was super good. The Cheesecake Factory can be great, depending on what you order and who cooks it, but it can also be just ok.  I've never had a bad meal here, but it seldom blows me away.  The wide selection is great for groups with picky eaters because there is literally something for everyone.  However that large menu comes at a price.  They don't master it all.  Still, it's worth the occasional visit, especially for dessert.  I have never had a bad cheesecake here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2

While I haven't tried dining here for their actual food, I've had plenty of their cheesecakes. But hey it's called The Cheesecake Factory, not Overpriced Pasta Factory. If I wanted that, I would go to Maggiano's across the street.  The Mango Key Lime Cheesecake topped with a mango mousse on a thick vanilla coconut macaroon crust is my favorite. Any cheesecake needs a good amount of citrus to balance out that fatty filling. The mango offers a unique tartness that the other cakes don't, including strawberry (which would be my second). The cheesecakes are great, service even for a supposed grab-and-go setup was and is always terrible, and the interior albeit nice is way too dark.

Felicia C.,"Menlo Park, CA",221,85,213,3.0,7/9/2017,"The interior of Cheesecake Factory is beautiful and very clean. It was also really crowded so I suggest coming here early. We came at 5:30 and our food was brought at 6:45. We waited about an hour for our food, but in the meantime, the waiter brought us some bread, wheat and sourdough. My friends and I ordered the jambalaya pasta, eggplant Parmesan, original cheesecake, and tiramisu cheesecake. Jambalaya pasta- The pasta had a unique flavor to it. It's basically jambalaya mixed with pasta. There were some shrimp and chicken in the dish. The sauce was very yummy. I would order this again. Eggplant Parmesan- The fried eggplant was extremely oily. So oily to the point that I didn't want to finish the dish. The outside wasn't crispy anymore. But the cheese and the marinara sauce was really good. The eggplant also came with some pesto pasta which was even more oily. I don't think I would order this dish again. Onto dessert!!! Original cheesecake- YESSSS! This is what they're famous for. It was creamy and tasted sooo good. Probably one of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted, so I would definitely order this again. Tiramisu cheesecake- I expected it to taste at least a little like cheesecake, but it didn't at all. The tiramisu flavor overpowered the cheesecake flavor, so basically it was just tiramisu. I would have liked some cheesecake flavors, and this disappointed me, so I don't think I would order this again. Overall my experience at Cheesecake Factory was ok. The service was really slow and some dishes I didn't really like.

Shannon W.,"Cupertino, CA",1664,159,490,2.0,7/1/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Westfield Valley Fair in West San Jose, next to Macy's mens. We came on a Saturday for lunch at 1pm, and got seated within 5 minutes. The hostess was very nice! We got the crab cake appetizer ($13) and factory combo: herb crusted salmon and filet mignon with mashed potatoes ($22.50). The food came pretty fast, around 15-20 minutes. However, I didn't have a great experience for the value. For a lunch costing a total of $45 for 2, with only one appetizer and one entree, it was VERY little food.  The crabcakes appetizer comes with THREE crabcakes, with like a 2 inch diameter, tiny!! The two sauces were great, but it's not proportional to the amount of crabcake they gave! Delicious, but really not worth it.  The salmon and filet mignon pieces were also extremely small. The salmon was like 2x4 inches, and not incredibly good. The filet mignon was 3 small, thin pieces.. They didn't skimp on the mashed potato though. Gave an awful lot of that. But that's not worth $23 is it.  Also, I really like the wheat grain bread at the Cheesecake chains. So the first waiter for 1 wheat grain and 1 sourdough bread, and my friend and I finished that. so we asked for some more wheat grain bread, and it took 25 minutes for that to come out. We finally got to eat some bread.. after we finished our meal. It also took a really long time to flag someone down and give us a check.  This place has the decor, good location, and fine food, but the portions are incredibly skimpish and the service is lacking.

Alison Y.,"Fremont, CA",505,74,316,2.0,6/14/2017,"The only time I think of coming to The Cheesecake Factory is if I'm going with a large group to celebrate something. They're great for accommodating big parties, so I'll give them that. But in terms of their food, I'd much rather eat elsewhere.  We got here a little before 6:00 PM on a Sunday (after a failed attempt to eat at Din Tai Fung, which had an estimated 2 hour wait time - yikes!!), and we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The first part of our dining experience went pretty smoothly. Getting our drinks, ordering, and receiving our appetizers (and their delicious complimentary bread) all happened in a timely manner.  APPETIZERS: The WARM CRAB & ARTICHOKE DIP was very flavorful and paired really with their crunchy grilled bread! This was definitely the highlight of the meal for me. The NASHVILLE HOT CHICKEN NUGGETS were pretty good as well and not that spicy thankfully.  MAIN COURSE: Everything that went wrong during this portion of the meal is why I'm only giving this restaurant 2 stars. Strike #1: My mom ordered a Filet Mignon, and they didn't bring her a steak knife. She had to flag down our server to ask for one, which took some time. Strike #2: My dad ordered an omelette, which was offered with a side of potatoes or tomatoes. He went with tomatoes, and when the dish was delivered, there were no tomatoes. He had to ask about it, and our server eventually brought it out for him after. Strike #3: My brother ordered the factory combination with Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira. And there was a piece of plain cooked pasta in his dish when his order clearly had no pasta items. Seems like sloppy food service or poor quality control to me... And lastly, I ordered pasta with shrimp and sausage, which was just average.  DESSERT: How could you come to The Cheesecake Factory and not get a slice of cheesecake?

Cathleen F.,"Sunnyvale, CA",23,16,5,1.0,12/27/2017,"For horrendous service, this restaurant takes the (cheese)cake. If zero stars was an option, that would have been a no-brainer. 1. Very short staffed. Everything took a very, very long time. 2. Two out of four of our bread plates were visibly dirty. 3. They were out of fish for their Fish 'n' Chips (my husband doesn't eat meat, so that matters to us). 4. My pasta dish was terrible. 5. The customer service was horrible. My husband and I arrived at 9pm on a Tuesday night, the day after Christmas, with our two year old and four year old, for a nice anniversary dinner. Our main mission was cheesecake, but we decided to have some dinner first. It was crowded but the wait was only about twenty minutes, so that was reasonable to us. We were seated at our table and after five minutes or so, our waitress came by and took our drink orders. When she came a while later, we mentioned that our plates were dirty and asked if she could bring new ones when she brought the bread. I heard her mention to our neighboring table that they were out of bread and that they were making more, so I knew it would be a while (and it was). But when she came to bring the bread a while later, no new plates. Waited a while for new plates. We knew what we wanted but waited quite some time, again, for the waitress to come take our orders. Then we went to place said order only to find out they were out of fish. We picked a replacement item fairly quickly but it still took a very long time to get the food. When the food arrived, my husband's eggplant parmesan was great, but my dish (Shrimp with Angel Hair with the basil garlic lemon cream sauce from the Bistro Shrimp Pasta dish) was terrible. It was watery, flavor-less, and seemed to be missing any trace of salt (I never thought I'd say this of a big chain restaurant, where salt is never in short supply). It looked somewhat creamy, but very, very watery. I tried salting it a couple times and mentioned it to the waitress so she brought some parmesan. That didn't make a big difference so she offered to bring some alfredo sauce. That kind of helped, but by that point it had been a long time and I had just sort of given up hope. My kids were eating the plain pasta (as most kids would), and I ate what I could so as not to be wasteful. Even without kids (who were being so well behaved and patient), I would not have wanted to extend my stay at that restaurant any longer by ordering something else or having it re-made. Not that that was even offered.  After experiencing the super slow service, dirty plates, and dissatisfying food, we thought it prudent to try to resolve it with a manager. We explained the issues to him, were very friendly, understanding and empathetic, and he seemed personable and apologetic. After listening and explaining that they were very short staffed, apologizing for the pasta dish not turning out very well, he offered a cheesecake as a resolution. In my head, I was thinking a whole cheesecake is pretty expensive and probably more than we need, but maybe they have small ones. And even then, if my pasta dish was $20 and a cheesecake is maybe $50, cost of food + bad experience = not that excessive in terms of compensation. So our waitress asks what kind of cheesecake we'd like, we tell her we'd like the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake, but to go (2 year old was starting to fall asleep at the table, can't blame him). When she comes with our to-go bag, there's one small slice of cheesecake in it. My husband and I look at each other like, um, is this happening right now? Is this worth fighting over? We ask the waitress for clarification, she explains yes, the one slice is intentional. She goes on to explain that when things go wrong, that's their go-to solution, one slice of cheesecake, and implies that the real problem is that I still ate my plate of pasta. I caught the manager again on our way out and he mansplained about their customer service, laughed at the idea of a whole cheesecake, and again faulted me for eating the dish. He went on about how they rush a replacement to you for a mess-up dish when I mentioned not wanting to wait any longer. Also threw in that they give you bread/salad while you wait. I mentioned how long we waited for bread, that the waitress had said they were out in the beginning, and he corrected me and said they're never out of bread, you just have to wait 10 minutes for more to be made. If your customer service is working, you shouldn't have to explain how it's working. If your food and service are good, you don't even get to that point. If you resolve any issues that DO arise well, the customer leaves even happier than they would have been if everything was great to begin with. The kicker? We get home and discover they gave us the wrong flavor cheesecake. (Happy anniversary, sweetheart!) We're friendly, patient, and tip 20-100% and had to leave this place without leaving a tip. The management desperately needs to get its act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=20
Mitzy B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",543,297,40,4.0,9/5/2017,"110 degrees at noon on a Saturday means time to enjoy the cool relief of someone else cooking lunch for you. After a random adventure around the mall, the husband and I rewarded ourselves with a ""small"" lunch at The Cheesecake Factory (I say ""small"" because anyone who's ever been here knows none of their portions are small) We had the pleasure of having Greg as our server who had a great energy, good suggestions for our meal, and made great conversation. We've had a recent history of some not so great restaurant servers so it was very refreshing!  Unfortunately, they were out of the ""Pizza-Style"" Chicken parmesan, but we were very pleased with our second choice of Pineapple crusted chicken and shrimp dish. We split this and ended the meal with Adam's Peanut Butter pie. Holy richness! I love oreo cookie crust but was so happy we split this - I needed to be carried out afterward. Living in Sonoma County I don't get to enjoy chain restaurants as much (first-world problems, we have too many amazing unique restaurants), so it was a fun change to visit The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=20
Winona J.,"Campbell, CA",67,66,3,1.0,11/16/2017,This location is big on inconveniencing you for the sake of it. Arrived at 3:30 which is a notoriously empty time for any restaurant. This one was no different. So we were told that we would be seated right away. So we stood near the stand until 4:03 to be seated in the bar area which had every single table empty except for two. Are you serious? The attitude is very cold at the front desk. Like it is a bother to have customers. The managers were hanging out at the front just watching my sister and I stand around waiting for a table that was obviously ready for 1/2 an hour.

I would not order this if you are trying to get LIT. But if you like a delicious mild alcoholic drink, I would recommend. For the appetizer, we had the fried zucchini's. Fresh, crunchy and delicious. Would definitely get again. Sorry no pictures here unfortunately. For the main course, I had the Spicy Chipotle Pasta. Portion was huge, I had enough for a second dinner!

First impressions were that the menu was very extensive and probably has an option for everyone out there. It was a bit overwhelming in terms of organization and having pages & pages of food options. I ended up going with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was a very big portion of chicken served with green beans + mashed potatoes.  To be honest, I'd say the food was fairly basic and felt like a standard chain restaurant (think of Olive Garden or Outback). Not bad, but nothing to write home about (I'd say there are better choices for the price imo). Another negative was that my water had particles of food in it when served and the waiter didn't give me a replacement water until I had to ask twice over a period of 15 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=20

All this for some cake.  Granted it's a bday cake but, still. Tried to order the bone in ribeye (but received the rib eye) as well as the filet mignon. Both were pretty tasty and seasoned well. They both kept up to the medium rare request. Sides were a standard mashed potatoes and green beans. A little lack luster with little to no seasoning but, they're just fillers anyway. At least it was kind of healthy. And lastly, the salted caramel was really good. Maybe I should've ordered the cake instead of a slice.

The food finally arrives and the pasta has NO SAUCE on it. None. How does that even happen? After we waited for over an hour. My 12 year old was not happy. I had to get out of bed and go to McDonald's. The whole point of ordering door dash was so that I did not have to do that because I was sick in bed. The burger was cold. Not warm, no room temperature but cold. After I go get my son food. I come home. Warm up the flat bread and burger. Eat those two items and within two hours I was in the bathroom throwing up. ALL NIGHT! I don't know what was going on yesterday but my experience was terrible. Three emails to doordash and no response BUT Doordash didn't prepare the food.

Jonathan T.,"Cupertino, CA",400,403,410,4.0,5/22/2015,"Woot cheesecake factory! Your go to entry level fancy chain restaurant. Perfect for when you want to go for a nice dinner on a budget.  This location does not take reservations, at least it didn't when I tried to make one on the Saturday of Mother's Day. The wait is long, and they don't tell you accurate wait times. If the wait is actually an hour, they'll tell you half an hour. Just watch out for that and be prepared to wait longer than what you expect.  They give you a buzzer that alerts you at limited range so go shop around Valley Fair and come back when it's almost your turn to be called.  Excellent Service - Friendly, attentive, and polite waitstaff.  Portobello Mushroom, Avocado, Zuchini small plate - These are all deep fried and served with this chipotle style cream based sauce. It's delicious.  It came out very crispy and with a lot of batter, more than I prefer for my taste but that's what makes it come out crunchy. The portion is just enough for a party of 4 to each try a mushroom, avocado, and zucchini piece.  Vietnamese summer shrimp spring roll - Sweet and fragrant. This is not your typical Vietnamese springroll! The ingredients are not your typical bean sprouts and basal. They're stuffed with thick plump shrimp and various veggies that have been pickled and/or marinated. The flavors work very well together. It comes with 2 types of sauces! One is the typical peanut based dipping sauce, and other is a sweeter, teriyaki style sauce.  We chose to order these apps because everything else on the menu was a lot of fried/creamy/fatty stuff. Yes the mushroom/avocado/zucchini platter was fried, but at least there's some veggie based foods in there. I guess this just shows how limited your options are when you're going for something 'healthier'. Hibachi steak - the steak was delicious, as expected. You can't really go wrong with steak aside from not seasoning it properly and not getting the right cook on it. It came out to a good medium well, and was still moist and juicy on the inside. This dish was served with garlic red mashed potatoes with a hint of wasabi over the top! Soo good.  Turkey burger - I ordered this with sweet potato fries. As with all turkey burgers, the meat patty is gonna come out dry, nothing you can really do about it, and that's kinda the point of ordering a less fattening/healthier burger. The turkey was still seasoned well. I've had a lot better burgers elsewhere so it would be fair for me to say I'm disappointed in their burgers.  You cannot leave cheesecake factory without ordering their cheesecake! 30th anniversary cheesecake - It's basically a mix of chocolate and vanilla. Absolutely delicious. Thick, rich, creamy, and it just melts in your mouth. The cake portions are soft and moist, and complements the cream cheese area of the cake. You'd expect each slice to come out to over $10, but it's really more like $7-8 per slice. One slice is a good portion to share between 2 or even 3 people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=200

We had a party of 11 (cousins/relatives), we waited 45 minutes to sit on a Thursday night.... We were too hungry and tired so we didn't want to try other places since it was a struggle to find parking in this mall. Once we got seated, took them about 8 minutes to flag our waitress down since a lot of them said they didn't know who will be serving our table. After flagging our waitress it took another 10 minutes for her to bring us our water/drinks/bread. She brought us two trays of bread and one of the tray's bread was cold.... That ruined my appetite because I suppose that she just took it and didn't even bother to heat it up. We ordered pizzas, appetizers, pastas as usual but it took a while for them to bring out the appetizers before our entrees lol.

I can't believe I'm writing a review in anger at 11 pm but it should not go unsaid. I called to place a Curbside order at appx 920 pm.  This was for the Valley Fair mall, Santa Clara location.  I was on hold for eleven minutes before someone answered.  I placed my order.   I arrived at the location immediately, they came out and I paid in cash.   Obviously it's the end of the dinner rush and Chzcake is a busy restaurant so I understood that it would take time for my order.  But 20 minutes passed.  Then 30.  Then 40.  Then 45.   47 minutes passed before I finally lost my patience and called in.  I told the hostess who answered the phone that I had been waiting over 45 minutes for my food.  She said she would get me to someone in bakery right away.  I was on hold for six minutes and no one picked up.   At this point, I was about to simply leave but realized that I had already paid.  And tipped!  I called back, the same hostess answered the phone and she told me she would get someone right away.  Someone at the bakery picked up and said they would bring the food right out. When I received the food, it was clearly evident that the pasta had been sitting for some time, as the food (which is covered inside of a box designed to stay hot) was slightly less than lukewarm.  I told the guy to just give me my money back. He went in and out came the manager.  Her name was Samantha Zaragoza (sp.?).  She handed me my cash.  Her words to me verbatim: ""Sir, your order tonight was $31, here's your cash-- did you need anything else tonight?"" I kind of wanted to say, ""Yes, my food, hot as it should be, delivered on time, without having to hold for a combination of over 15 minutes on the phone please :)"" but instead I decided to just leave.

zahra b.,"San Francisco, CA",287,54,2,1.0,8/1/2017,"Woah. I just had one of my worst restaurant experiences ever here. A few friends decided to come out together for their July 31 cheesecake special. We arrived at 8:30pm and were told the wait would be 60-75 minutes long. No problem. We were seated at approximately 9:30pm. We came for the cheesecake special! It was advertised on their website, signage, etc. So place our orders, with some for dine in, which we assume will be on the special and some to go, which we assume will be full price. However, the waitress tells us we need to order entres to get the cheesecake discount. Except that's not anywhere in the marketing or fine print. She insists it is. One of the girls had been there the night before and says she wasn't required to do the same last night. The waitress says it was a mistake. We ask about all of the other people who have been in line and are there as it doesn't appear they are all ordering entres. The waitress says some of the other staff may be unfamiliar with the rules and undercharging people. We ask her to check with her manager.  She does. Her narrative stays the same. Entres are required. The sign at the door says it. I go look at the sign. It matches what corporate has on the site. One per person. Dine in only. Nothing about a required entre. We ask to see the manager.  The manager comes out. He apologizes and says he understands we have been waiting and will give us the 1/2 price cheesecakes. We ask about the confusion and he explains the wait staff were asked to encourage people to order entres to minimize the lines.  What in the world? Encourage and require are two very different things. Not to mention the lying about the posters and other people's orders.  Ok. We're all set. Cheesecakes were ordered nearly 30 minutes ago, pricing issues have been cleared up, and maybe we will enjoy the rest of the night? No.  10 more minutes go by and we still don't have our cheesecakes. One of the girls asks the waitress. Oops.

First, when they took our order, they said it would be ready in 30 minutes and it still wasn't ready in 50 after trying to find parking.The parking at valley fair is atrocious so just to find parking took my co worker about 20 minutes. Then, when we finally got our food back to work, it looked really unappetizing. The salad looked good and that's about to. The buffalo wings had no buffalo sauce and we were charged double the price listed on the website. When we ordered, we asked for some extras on the side and of course they weren't there even though they were on the receipt. For 2 people our bill was 50$ and that's without a tip.

Amadea M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",0,18,17,1.0,12/10/2017,"What an awful first time experience at The Cheesecake Factory! I went with a party of 6, and we had to wait over an hour until we got seated. While it was really busy, it had died down quite a bit once we got to our table. Service was super slow and it took another hour after ordering before we saw any food. What really bothered us was they brought out our food at different intervals. Two people got their plates first, then another two plates arrived 15 minutes later, then the last two plates arrived about 10 minutes later. It really sucked, especially since we didn't start eating until everyone got their food. By then, some of our plates lost their heat. I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad and couldn't believe what they served me. The (small) piece of salmon looked and tasted old, and was definitely not crusted with almonds. Instead, they squirted a mayo sauce on top and sprinkled almond bits on top (which I couldn't eat, and scraped it off). The bottom of the salmon and edges were super dry too and did not look fit for eating. I don't understand why people like this place so much. It's overpriced, slow and poor quality. I can't say anything about their cheesecake though since I opted not to try and because I couldn't stomach any more of their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=80

The waiter suggested we wait and would only be served by the same person who took the order.  After waiting for 10 more minutes we asked another waiter to help out; he said he would check the status of the order.

While we were waiting for bread to arrive I saw every other table being served with bread and food. Despite mentioning that by daughter was hungry nothing was being done. After 1 hr 15 minutes we decided to leave as we never got bread or our drinks.  We let the receptionist know that we are leaving without having any food, she asked us to talk with the Manager. The manager intervened and mentioned that we don't have to pay for food; without even listening to what we complaining about. After letting the manager know that we had nothing to eat she said sorry and would be ok if we left.  This made my wife and me sad and angry. None of staff cared about a 22 month old leaving hungry without any food. I was angry that the Manager jumped to a conclusion saying that we don't have to pay for food even before listening to us.

After a long wait a table was opening up and we asked them to give us the table when they leave. Long story short, we lost 2 tables to 2 men who felt it was ok to bully us, insult us and take the tables we had waited for. We talked with 2 managers, and our waiter but all we got was we're sorry!

Chaz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,13,1,2.0,5/30/2017,We went to the this location for my birthday dinner. I mentioned that it was my birthday and the waiter acknowledged. When ordering our food we asked if our food could come out with the appetizers and not to wait for the appetizers to come out and then do the food he must have forgot that because our food came out a while after the appetizers were finished. The waiter was a little forgetful. When my wife entree came which was salmon with broccoli the broccoli had yellow flowers on it and there was brown spots also. We asked to see the manager and Jason came. He tried to explain that the broccoli was just fine and I showed him and told him that the the broccoli had brown spots he told me no it's yellow and I said no sir it is not yellow it's over right and it has lost a lot of it nutrients. He offered to go back to the kitchen and have some new broccoli made up that was more presentable when it came out it was overcooked and it still had brown spots on it. He also told me that they accepted the order of overripe broccoli.  The next issue which is a little more disconcerting is that during my meal I had fruit flies flying around our booth first there was just one and then by the end of the meal there was 4 of them flying around the window and then there was a dead one on the windowsill. Kind of makes you wonder how clean the restaurant is when they have fruit flies flying around. Oh and to top it all off they forgot my birthday oh well at least my hamburger was okay and my son like this spaghetti but we will probably not be visiting that location again because of the fruit flies and the lack of compassion from the manager Jason 5/31 Corporate called me and they were very nice apologetic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=120

Tonight was the straw that broke the camels back.  I placed my order at 9:30pm. Was asked if I want complimentary cutlery and bread. I obliged and said yes and I also requested ranch dressing. The server told me it would be about 20 min and the food will be ready.  I arrived at 10:15pm.. When I arrived the lady at the register was inputting her tips in the computer and asked me to wait for 10 minutes I waited like an idiot and now 55 minutes later and my order was still not ready. I asked for ranch because they forgot my ranch. Finally 5 minutes later ranch came out  I wanted to add banana cheesecake to my order they were out..  I wanted to add chocolate moose cheesecake to my order they were out..  I wanted to add carrot cake to my order they were out .. I wanted bread with my meal. Guess what they handed me a rock hard stale piece of bread and when I asked the cashier for some real bread. He went digging in other people's to-go bags until finally going to the kitchen and finding out there's no more bread!  At this point I have been at Cheesecake Factory for 40 min it's 10:55 and they are about to close. And the guy who helped me saw I was frustrated and annoyed and didn't offer any explanation but send an older Asian lady  over to tell me they had no bread.  By the time I got home finally and sat to eat food was cold and not edible. Ended up throwing all the food away.  Cheesecake Factory how can you run out of cheesecake??! It's your main product. This place should be called ""were out of Cheesecake Factory""  No one offered me a single discount and no one apologized for the crap service. I guess they don't care about their customers.

I was initially planning to either (hopefully) cash it in to someone or just give it away, thinking there's no way I'd use it. I'm glad I did. We ordered the buffalo tenders appetizer to start, which is a little pricey at $9, but surprisingly yummy. Normally I don't really like spicy buffalo anything, but my boyfriend ordered it without prior knowledge of this, and the waiter swiftly put in the order before we could track him down to change our minds haha.  My boyfriend also ordered the Cheesecake Factory burger with cheese (I think?? Does this exist on the menu? lol) and I got the au jus sandwhich (I can't remember the name of this either). Both were really freaking good! We could only finish half our meal, so took the rest as leftovers for the next day.

Service: Service here is always very friendly and helpful.  Top notch servers with great knowledge of the menu and very helpful with any requests or questions you have.  Requests are taken care of quickly, water is always filled and you are checked on without being pestered too much throughout your meal.

How two requests for ""medium rare"" came out entirely opposite is beyond me. The manager came over and acknowledged the mistake, apologized, and offered her another dish but she declined since she has lost her appetite. The bill came and unsurprisingly, they charged us for the burger. We were mad, but there was no point in arguing and ruining our Friday night.  They need to change their billing policy and not charge for flawed food. If you're going to charge $12 for a burger, at least do it right. I've had a small mom and pops restaurant comped $80 of food because it was salty. A huge restaurant chain like this surely can swallow $12.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340

We simply had to throw it away.  - Everyone's Fav Pasta - is no one's favorite pasta. The pasta was uncooked! - Stuffed mushroom - was the only thing slightly edible They did not even include utensils. Seriously, for the price you pay, this is NOT the kind of crappy food you expect. Do they even do quality checks for to-go orders? It seems like they just make some crappy shit in a hurry and throw it out for customers.  This is easily the worst branch of Cheesecake factory.

Wish they took reservations but unfortunately they are so fortunate to always have a ton of business at all hours of the day.  Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. Main reason for coming here is for the avocado egg rolls! They are delectable little treats that are crispy, fresh, have great flavors/sauce. Each bite is pure bliss, yum. A lot of other restaurants try to copy cheesecake factories avocado eggrolls however no one makes it even close to cheesecake factory's! Definitely recommend the Pasta da Vinci. Tender pieces of chicken, different types of mushrooms, grilled onions with penne pasta in a creamy white sauce. It is a little heavy and greasy but I love the flavors of this pasta dish.  The miso salmon is delicious! Salmon was perfectly cooked, great miso flavoring on top of a bed of white or brown rice. This dish could use more veggies though, there was only 5-6 pieces of snow peas. Beautiful presentation though, this is a dish that tastes as great at it looks. Strawberry cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake and white raspberry cheesecakes are all delicious!  Service has always been great here. Portions are HUGE (even lunch portions).

However the food and service was the worst we had ever had in our lives. To top it off both my girlfriend and her mother have been or are waitresses so they know their way around a restaurant. The waiter didn't know the menu, that's to say he didn't kow the size of their pizzas or if something came on the sandwich. They also spilled a full glass of water across my girlfriends mom and then just left the table, booth, and her soaking wet. It also bothered her that the waiter kept say hi guys or what do you guys need or sure guy I'll get that in right now, when short of myself she and my girlfriend are obviously women. The food was bland, flavorless, and the pizza was a salt lick. To top that off the cheese they shred onto your food was kept across from us in a rag on the server station. Then someone put a tray with dirty dishes on it and the it jus kept piling up and was eventually taken to another table to be used. They also took a fork off of the dirty dish tray and gave it to my girlfriends mom when she asked for a fork later. I had to stop her and gave her the one I wasn't using. I will never go to this location again and honestly may never return to the cheesecake factory at all.

Jodi H.,"Silicon Valley, CA",290,812,1283,2.0,9/7/2014,"I've gotta say...Cheesecake Factory has gone dooooownhill in the past couple of years. I went back a couple of days ago with my family, and we haven't been in a couple of years...and back then we LOVED TCF. Maybe it was because I was still a kid back then and totally loved the glitz and glamor of the beautiful large space...but the quality of the food, service, and ambiance have completely changed for the worse. Located in the prime space of Valley Fair shopping center, EVERYBODY I know has been to this TCF location. With that being said, you're always going to have a wait whether it's 5 minutes or over a solid hour. The place is GRAND and gorgeous with their European-painted ceilings and royal setup and white-clad servers. However, the place felt so empty and the AC was turned up way too high on the weekday night that I was there. A few years ago, TCF was always bustling with people out in front, and the place was packed with chattering and laughter, but we just didn't get that the night we ate here. Maybe it was because it was a strange weekday night, but who knows. We were served by Bridget, and she was polite and smiley, but only came around to check on us once in a while. We really enjoyed her going above and beyond to give us a sweet Happy Birthday ice cream, so thanks girl! As a server in the industry, I just wanted to comment on the unfortunate dress code policy! I felt so bad for the servers because they had to wear ALL WHITE (top and bottoms), so it was more obvious to see their stains and what not...but that's just me being a picky observer. In terms of the food, it was a bit pricey for the portion size/quality. I had Evelyn's Favorite pasta...and it was WAYYYYYY TOO SALTY! My mom also had a pasta that was pesto of some sort, and we both agreed that we were just oversalted with our taste buds! The flavors were pretty yummy, but the pasta chef really needs to tone down the salt level. I wouldn't come back here in a while--too much has changed in the last couple of years, so it would take lots of convincing for anyone in my family to come back.

We ordered two entrees but can't be too sure that's what we got. My husband ordered the chicken 'littles' and little they were not. The serving was huge. When it came to my meal I ordered one of the skinny luscious dishes, steak medallions. I have had this before at the restaurant and it was filling and delicious. That's not what I got this time. There was barely a tablespoon of mash potatoes, no sauce to speak off and very little else. Highly disappointing. I will have to think twice about going back there.

The manager came and offered if he could get me something to go which was nice but why would I want something to go after I just seen a cockroach. We were getting ready to get up from the table and it started running all around the table the manager came back and see it and thank god there were other customers who see the cockroach as well.

I ordered the garlic noodles, as I like garlic noodles. We started off with the usual bread and I especially enjoyed the darker bread (don't know what flavor it was). The waitress was also friendly and helpful to us. When the garlic noodles came, I started to eat. Since the server didn't ask if any of us wanted parmesan cheese, the waiter came by and noticed that and offered to grate us some cheese. So attentive! After getting cheese, we all started eating. The garlic noodles were pretty good in my opinion but I would've loved a stronger garlic flavor. As for the rest of the party, I've also took nibbles of each dish. There was some other pasta dishes and a tamale dish. All of which was pretty good. Having finished our meal, we ordered cheesecake.  We had the anniversary cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake. I liked the red velvet cheesecake way better. The anniversary cheesecake was a bit too chocolatey for me. If you LOVE chocolate, I think you'd like the anniversary cheesecake. They had both a cream cheese layer and a cake layer. I don't know how they do it, but it works and it's good. I liked it. My meal was complete and was enjoyable.

After I got their Yelp response:  1st thing I did:  I went to their site link, inputted a message that they wanted to talk to me, provided my # for them to call.  Later, I got a call from a guy from corporate who was very nice and seemed genuine in passing the message onto the real guy who is in the ""Investigation Dept"" (who was out of the office on time off).  A few weeks went by, nothing.  2nd thing I did:  I called back to corporate and asked to talked to this ""guy"" in the Investigation dept. He didn't seemed to know of my story (perhaps it was never communicated to him) and came off flustered. After telling my story again, he said he would look into it but that without any tangible evidence or police report, this was going to be a tough one.  Hmm...well of course the police never got involved but given how things played out, why not go interview your employees or review the tapes from the cameras at this location?

All the above from the ""manager"" Jason. OMG. Condescending, patronizing with a complete fake smile. His tone? Suited when addressing kids. Are you kidding me?

We ordered a fresh basil, tomato & cheese flatbread from the Skinnylicious - Small plates & Appetizers section. It was spot-on! The bread baked to perfection- soft n fresh & the harmony of basil -tomato with the melted cheese was simply great! Next was a Veggie Burger from the Glamburger & Sandwitches section.

Served on a Toasted Wheat Brioche Bun with Melted Fontina Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles and Mayo this was one whole some meal! Though the brown rice patty was dry n didn't much stick as one the flavors were good. Bread was soft n toasted well. We shared a burger n still felt very full. One cannot leave the place without tasting  its signature cheesecakes. My order was for a Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake. It was divine!!!!  An absolute sweet tooth lovers haven. Sweet to the palate, but contagious to not put back your spoon to dig in for another bite. The hazelnut flavor was very well dominant n so the crunch. Creamy n soft was the Cheesecake.To reduce the overpowering sweetness the whipped cream acted as a great accompaniment. By the end of all every bite was sinfully amazing.

Vivienne C.,"Fremont, CA",157,122,171,4.0,7/11/2017,"I mean it's Cheesecake Factory. It has a standard haha. I came with a huge group around 5:30 on a Saturday night with a reservation and we still got seated awhile later. The food service was pretty slow around 45 minutes, but it's great for social events. The food is okay, but here are some of the food we ordered. 1. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - The pasta was pretty good, with a mixture of green (basil?) noodles and orange (tomato?) noodles. I was kind of disappointed that the only meat there was, was chicken and shrimp, which does not make it a jambalaya. Strong Cajun flavor, but literally there was no sauce. Kind of disappointed. 2. Eggplant Parmesan - The eggplant was so oily. After we finished eating 2 (out of 3), the whole plate was drenched. The top is very crispy, not a lot of Parmesan flavor, but the bottom was so oily, it was low-key disgusting. The pesto pasta was really good though.  3. Miso Salmon - DAMN this is actually really good. I love the outer crust flavor, a little bit sweet with Asian flair. Also the rice really matches the dish, because it's so easy to eat. Honestly they do Asian pretty good haha. 4. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - Okay, I now understand the hype of this dish. It is actually pretty good because how many different kinds of ingredients there were in it. However, I feel like it was extremely salty, with the olives and the artichokes, the salt content was just too high. 5. Original Cheescake - Creamiest cheescake ever. It actually tasted pretty good, super silky and mesmerizing. I kind of forgot how it taste because yes, it's good, but it's not extremely memorable. 6. Tiramisu Cheesecake - This actually tastes like a tiramisu + cheescake combined. I don't know if this is the best combination, because coffee and cheese is kind of questionable together. Nevertheless, it is still really good. Overall, 3 for the food, but +1 for the bread. Okay the sourdough isn't really a sourdough, but the wheat bread was actually super delicious.

It's on the house but nothing too special so I wouldn't fill up on it. 2. Firecracker Salmon - Kind of a cool twist on firecracker shrimp. It's a long, skinny piece of salmon wrapped in a thin won ton wrapper. Only the sauce has some hint of ""spice"" in the most literal sense of the word, so you don't have to be worried about any explosions. There's a refreshing red cabbage slaw that's tossed lightly with some light dressing on the side. It was a tasty dish and a nice change from any old spring roll. 3. Bistro Shrimp Pasta - This was on the menu at a whopping 2100 calories. Fried shrimp, garlic cream sauce...mmm it was worth every single calorie. It's an enormous portion which is what must account for part of its delicious unhealthiness. 4. Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake - I swear they make you wait for your table so you have to ogle all the cheesecakes in all their glory in the front. There's no way you can say no to dessert after looking in the display case. If you enjoy Ferrero Rochers, you would love this cheesecake. The Nutella is a nice addition but even just the cheesecake is great. Note that this location is on the Winchester side of the mall.

We ordered cheesecake to go so we could share with my friend's family at home. We took a Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch and Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. To help celebrate, Marie & CJ sang for my friend and gave her a celebratory mini-sundae. Thanks Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=100
Isabelle V.,"Daly City, CA",85,16,1,1.0,12/14/2017,"You guys need to get it together. A line of 6 people waiting while 8 Employees are standing around behind the counter talking and watching the transaction taking place on one of the two registers. I get it, retail is busy! The manager was assisting a transaction with gift cards that was about a $600 purchase with multiple gift cards being loaded! Understandable. But The girl on the second register was talking with employees and didn't acknowledge the line of people waiting behind the first register until the manager directed people to the other line. Didn't seem like the second register was open since the girl was too busy talking with other employees. Multiple employees made eye contact with me and made no effort to assist me even though they were all doing NOTHING. Finally a man asked me if I needed help. Then the lady who I assume was the manager on duty gives me attitude because I mentioned it. All of a sudden once the manager says that the girl on the other register was open I was so irritated. Do your job and talk on your break!!! To the manager, instead of giving attitude maybe you should check your employees and have them working instead of standing around chatting during the dinner rush.

Brandon Y.,"San Jose, CA",827,615,1134,2.0,2/17/2017,"Sooo probably not the best place to go on a holiday... Even before arriving here, the parking lot was packed, and the construction makes it really confusing as to where there may be open spots (unless you want to pay for valet). Some family friends and I went to this spot for dinner for four on a Tuesday evening, and the wait was quite long. Apparently they'll only take reservations if your party is over a certain number. After 40-ish minutes, we were seated. I stayed rather basic and got the most popular Chicken Madeira, while those around me ordered Bang Bang Thai Dish, jambalaya, and a mango salad. Forty five minutes in, our server told us that someone had dropped the Bang Bang, so they're scurrying to make another one. The other dishes came first, and they were of decent proportion, and my chicken madeira was better than I've had before (usually it's rather dry). The jambalaya looked like it had been sitting out a bit because the noodles were stuck together. The mango salad was huge and delicious though. The Bang Bang they to-go'ed for us since we opted for cheesecake - nutella hazelnut and red velvet. Honestly, I think the cakes are a bit overpriced and overly sweet. I typically go for a little bit lighter on the sweets but keep the richness of the cheese. By the time we got out, we had spent 3 hours in that restaurant despite the kind waiter letting us know how crazy it was and apologizing profusely for everything (we did end up getting one of the cheesecakes for free). As we were leaving, still a ridiculous line with people looking tired for having waited...

Our waitress passed by and I asked if she could check on our food. Right after she left she came back with our food.  Everything was good, but it definitely was not worth the wait. We asked for boxes once we were full, and that also took about 20 minutes for our waitress to bring out. We wanted to leave and go to the mall after, so we asked another waiter to give us boxes.

Quick service, consistent food, huge portions, friendly staff, and has a beautiful ambiance. When I come to Cheesecake Factory, I never care how much I eat and i never watch my calorie intake when I dine here because i know everything is going to be so good!! Food - (my favorites) -   The complimentary sourdough and honeywheat bread is always good. I love the honeywheat bread but I always make sure not to eat too much so I have room for my meal and dessert. Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta: My favorite pasta dish!! The sauce is amazing with the kick of spicyness. Govida chocolate cake - Make with no flour!! It is not too bitter and not overly sweet. Service - Despite how popular Cheesecake factory is and the long line of people waiting for their table, I am surprised that the wait for a party of 2-4 is usually less than a 30 minute wait. Even if it was 1 hour long, I might still be willing to wait for a table. Staff is always friendly and makes sure you are satifsifed with your meal. I came to this locations serveral times. Food and service is very consistent. One time, a waiter accidentally dropped a lady's dish and scared everyone around with a loud bang. He took is very professionally and gave her a new dish that came out 5 mins later and offered her sparkling water/soda to calm her down.

I asked was she getting my order and she said for me to wait. !!!! Then she proceeded to help this other person and hadn't finished my order. Looked like she was going to help the next person who had next walked in!!! Another person appeared behind the counter...who as it was turned out to be ""one of the managers"" . All the time I was waiting this Fatima seemed oblivious of me waiting. I was really upset at the lack of customer care, when I pointed this out to both of them it was met with denial....just crazy. The ""Manager"" had told me that there were customers and I had to wait my turn....I told him I was the first in line. You know its very pathetic that a simple order cannot be fulfilled.

The annoying thing was that they didn't have enough buzzers so I would just have to stand around and constantly check in with the host.  My boyfriend and I were seated about 10 minutes before the party next to us. Our server came over shortly after and took the drink orders for both tables. She came back 5 minutes later with drinks for the other table and took their order. Another 10 minutes pass before she finally comes back with my glass of wine and take our order. (She didn't bring my bf's drink for another 10 minutes after mine but to be fair it was a cocktail). Annoying since we were seated first and my drink order was not even complicated. Not to mention she forgot our waters and I had to ask another server for it halfway through our meal.  We decided to order the nachos to share and it was huge! We barely made a dent in it! My bf had the steak dianne and I had the pasta da vincii. When my pasta arrived, the penne was so hard! I told the server and she said that their pasta is served al dente. I've dined at cheesecake factory before and other Italian restaurants and my order was not al dente, it was hard!. I decided to let it slide since the they were busy and she did offer to have the kitchen remake it. 15 minutes later, and I get my pasta back and it is the exact same texture. Not sure if she just gave me back the same plate but whatever I had two bites of it and decided to just take it to-go along with the nachos since I was practically full from eating off my bf's plate.   When I got home, I opened up the box of nachos and a cockroach crawls out! GROSS. It couldn't have gotten into the box while it was closed so it must have been when the server was boxing it up for us. I am so grossed out that I tossed my barely eaten pasta as well in fear of there being little critters in there. Such a waste of a meal. This is by far my worst experience yet at Cheesecake factory and I will not be returning.  1 star because they were busy so I understand for most of the mistakes  1 star because my bf actually enjoyed his meal and drinks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=140

I finally grabbed another waiter. Not happy at this point and asked if we could order as it's been well over 20 minutes. He apologized and investigated what happened. Of course it took another 5 mins and finally our waiter came around. Took our orders and said would bring bread. I asked for more water. Of course, 10 mins go by and no water. I grabbed another staff walking by and asked (still very politely) for more water. Anyways, you know how the story goes. Good came out late too.

Quyen L.,"San Jose, CA",654,439,1650,2.0,12/13/2015,"Long waits, giant portions, ASTRONOMICAL CALORIE COUNT, not the best descriptions for any restaurant, but unfortunately those fit the bill when describing the Cheesecake Factory. Located next to Westfield Valley Fair on Steven's Creek Boulevard, there is no denying that this is a lucrative establishment. Even at 8:30 pm on a Sunday night, there was still a 15 minute wait to grab a table at a place that must have HUNDREDS of seats. My sister, her husband, and I were too lazy to go anywhere far from the mall and since it had been over a year since I ate at the Cheesecake Factory, we thought it would be a good idea for dinner. If only we knew better... Appearance wise, the decor is great. Low, mood lighting, beautiful artwork on the ceilings and walls, marbled floors and columns are just a few of the intricate designs you will find in the restaurant. It is certainly a good place to take a date or your friends and family for a classier dinner, if all you're looking for is ambiance.  Our waitress for the night was friendly enough, but she seemed incredibly scattered. My sister had ordered a glass of Moscato and she failed to bring her the beverage at least 15 minutes after she had ordered it. When we needed her help, she was nowhere to be found and we had to wait for a good ten minutes before she finally came back. She was clearly a nice person, but as a waitress, left more to be desired. For our entrees, my sister ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta (extra spicy), my brother-in-law got the white chicken chili with white rice, and I chose the cajun jambalaya pasta.  When I read the description for my entree, I was super excited to dig into a dish that boasted spicy flavors, crunchy bell peppers, juicy chicken, and succulent shrimp on a bed of linguine pasta. What I got was a dish that lacked any sort of spice, aside from the aroma from the bell peppers, and linguine that was horribly bland. How can any entree called CAJUN JAMBALAYA be bland? Is that even possible? I couldn't believe how boring everything tasted!  My brother-in-law's dish looked like it was missing half of its portion, although if it was just going to be more of the hard, stale rice, I think he would say it wasn't much of a loss. My sister's pasta was definitely not spicy, let alone the extra spicy she had requested, and lacked a good amount of sauce as well.  Honestly, the only redeeming quality here was the house wheat bread, but even its warm, soft goodness couldn't save this train wreck of a meal. At the price we paid, we definitely felt like we were ripped off. It was obvious that the cooks didn't put much thought into their dishes tonight. Was it because it was so late on a Sunday evening? Perhaps, but regardless of the time, we were still paying customers who were looking to enjoy a pleasant dinner. It had been almost two years since the last time I've been back to the Cheesecake Factory.

I order the Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad and Chipotle Chicken Pasta everytime I come.  Chipotle Chicken Pasta 5/5 Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad 5/5 Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip 4/5 Bread 5/5 Food overall is great! Service however was 2/5 for my most recent experience dining here. I ordered 2 Ahi Tuna Tataki Salads and was delivered two plates of Seared Ahi Tuna on rice. My family and I were extremely understanding of the miscommunication since there are a couple dishes that contain ""Ahi Tuna."" The manager apologized for the mix-up and took the appetizer off our bill. The Ahi salad and chipotle pasta again were amazing. However, our server not only blamed me for speaking too low while ordering but also quickly reduced her quality of service for the rest of the evening. I'm not too sure if I'll be back at this location.

Sammy C.,"San Jose, CA",243,423,752,5.0,12/4/2015,"When I visit Cheesecake Factory, I always and only sit at their bar; especially for this location, their bartenders are extremely friendly and nice. The ones I often speak to are Gilbert, Chris and Justin; their service is right at the level of high class saloon bartenders, very knowledgable and professional (trust me, I've been to many). I'm the kind of girl who's straight forward and cannot tolerate bullshit; when I casually ask for fine scotch, they know what I'm talking about (most bartenders from other chain restaurants often provide miss information). I find it very enjoyable to have a nice fine scotch and dinner here at the bar; If the bar takes a 45-min wait versus table, take the bar any day. Oh, and my favorite dishes are Miso Salmon and Grilled Artichoke; I'm not a cake person but my husband loves their Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake.

Not too chocolatey. :) The only thing I didnt appreciate was because the restaurant was getting busy, I noticed Dominique wasnt coming around as often, and we had to ask for refills. By the time we got our food, it wasnt hot. It was a little warm, to say the least... my mashed potatoes were cold and a little stiff, i got the salmon and steak factory combo, the salmon was good, moist, and my steak because it wasnt brought out right away, it was chewy and wasnt that great.

They have sooo much- my favorites are: -Parmesan Crusted Chicken -Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms -Lemon Garlic Shrimp -Steak Diane -Thai Glazed Salmon -Almost ALL the appetizers -ALL the cheesecakes of course Service: It always depends on your server and how busy it is but mostly, I've always had friendly, quick servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=160

We got our entrees before our appetizer, which confused us at first but it was no biggie.  Immediately the manager Julian (hope I spelled your name right) came to our table, apologized for the mixup and even comped the the appetizer!

It is such a cute place with nice decors for a nice outing with family and friend, or even a date night! Either way, I always manage to have a great time at the Cheesecake Factory!  I love that they have a huge menu with over two hundred items to choose from. Even so, I always go with their Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. It is my absolute favorite dish of all time! Some of my other favorite dishes when I can get past my craving for the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta are: Pasta da Vinci, Louisiana Pasta, Chicken Madeira, Chicken Piccata, Miso Salmon, etc. These are certain items on the menu that you have to try! Not to mention, they have very generous portions, especially for dinner.  Also, they have a great selection of Cheesecakes and they are displayed very nicely at the Bakery. I love their Original and Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. This says a lot because I'm not even a Cheesecake person, yet I'll only eat Cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory!  Anyways, my last experience there was on a Friday night last week. My friend and I sat at the bar and was helped by two very sweet bartenders: Jimmy and Justin. They were both very nice, attentive, accommodating and patient with us. Anyways, I only ordered some sliders this time since I mainly came here for drinks. But I need to mention that their sliders were only decent. However, their drinks are good, especially the Strawberry Daiquiri! It is delicious; and remember, you have to ask them to put whip cream on if you like whip cream with your Strawberry Daiquiri. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Excellent food and service. The only thing is that the food can be heavy and a bit greasy, but that is just why it's so delicious.

Jennifer D.,"Felton, CA",1,5,,2.0,5/15/2017,"If you would have asked me before last night to rate this restaurant, I would have given it 4-5 stars. My family and I usually come here about once a month with a fairly large group, around 7-9 people, and have never really had any issues until now.  We came here last night for Mothers day dinner. It was busy when we arrived, but not overly so. Wait time was about an hour, which was fine because we knew there would be a wait on a holiday and we were able to kill time in the mall before heading to dinner. The problems started after we ordered our food. We were visited by two different managers at our table before our food even showed up to apologize for the wait, which we thought was odd since we didn't feel the wait was excessive at that point. It just seemed average for a weekend dinner here. When the food arrived at our table, one of the entrees was wrong. We promptly notified the person who brought the food out to the table (who wasn't our server) and they said they would fix it right away. Fair enough. Our server then came to the table, apologized for the mix up and said the correct entree would be out in about 5-7 minutes.  We waited another couple of minutes and the ""new"" entree comes out to the table. The supposed ""new"" entree ended up being the exact same plate of food they had sent out earlier, which was wrong. We told them again that it was wrong, they apologized again, and again they said they would correct it. At this point, one person at our table still did not have their food, Our waitress seemed to have disappeared and the correct entree still had not been brought out yet. We waited about 15 minutes and tried to flag someone down to figure out what was going on. You would think that it would have been easy to flag down a manager since two of them had already been to our table, but they were nowhere to be found at that point. Neither was our waitress. We ended up flagging down a server from another table and asked to speak with a manager. At this point a third manager comes out. I believe his name was Justin. We explain what was going on. At this point, those of us who got our food were pretty much done eating and the corrected entree never came out. He apologized and offered us a couple free deserts. We reluctantly agreed. Several minutes later and no server had taken our dessert order. We finally found out from the manager that he had switched our server without telling us, since he thought that we had an issue with the first one. It wasn't really her that was the issue, it was the kitchen staff, but ok. If you are going to give us another server, why wouldn't you tell us so we know who is going to be taking our order? At this point we were fed up and one of us was still hungry since he never received his correct food. They offered to box it up for us to go, but we were just so frustrated at this point that we wanted nothing more to do with this restaurant. We decided to skip dessert, which I had been looking forward to all day. It surprises me that on such a busy day with so many ""managers"" floating around the restaurant that our service was so terrible. It pretty much ruined our Mother's Day dinner and left me not wanting to come back. Which is sad, since we've had good service here before.

When our other friends came she carded everyone which is protocol and one of my friends IDs were expired and again I get that it's protocol to not serve someone with an expired ID but she was super rude about it   Anyways moving forward our waiter (Steve) was super rude as well! We asked for bread about three times and he kept saying its in the oven how ever other tables were getting bread ... And he even rolled his eyes at one of my friends like if you're having a bad day please do not take it out on us..  My other friend went back to the bar to get a beer and the same bar tender gave him a lot of attitude to the point where she verbatim said ""I'm speaking English "" what do you think my friend was speaking in? And way to be racist ...  So we decided to inform the manager bout our server and the bar tender she came back to our table trying to give reason why they did what they did and not even genuinely apologizing for anything .. (Grace) I mean she apologized but it was the most unapologetic apology I've ever heard..  Anyways so we got a new server whose name I wasn't able to get but she was amazing !

Mind you, we all arrived at 6:00PM. We were not seated until 8:45PM. We were a party of 13.

My friends and I were not happy with the rude treatment given when we were trying to ask about our table.  Bottom line is, this place is great in every other aspect except in respect for their customer's time. Please please implement a new system, allow customers to make reservations and all will be solved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=360
Monica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2356,1171,1527,3.0,8/25/2013,"3.5 stars, bordering 4 I've been coming here since I was a little girl still in school...now I'm old and decrepit and I STILL go here! Not as often, especially since I've moved away from the area, but  the food is pretty solid as most Cheesecake Factories are. The salads are giant, and portion sizes are crazy. Taste, however, is not ""WOW AMAZING"", but nor is it ""BLECH!"" It's a ""pretty good, but I've had better and this is forgettable"" sorta deal. Service ranges from ""eek!"" to ""wow this person is amazing!"", with most of my experiences being good. Cheesecakes are a must, as this is THE cheesecake factory! Very rich, decadent, and hell on the arteries, but almost all the cheesecakes are divine. My personal favorite is the classic vanilla bean, but you can't go wrong with Oreo or chocolate tuxedo.  Be warned of constant huge lines and hordes of people waiting for a table though...I think that's the worst part of the experience, and the food does take a bit to come out, so be prepared. Luckily, bread IS offered in case you are starving!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=360

Ananta S.,"Santa Clara, CA",46,33,144,5.0,9/3/2015,The cheesecakes at the Cheesecake Factory are to die for. Ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake yesterday night - it's a three layered chocolate cake with cream on the sides. A must try for all those chocolate lovers out there!  I ordered the Fried Mac n Cheese as an entree. The dish is listed as a side on their menu. Sinfully - the dish apparently has over 1.3K calories. Haha. For 4 round mac n cheese balls. Amazing though - the best mac n cheese I've ever tried. We also ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken. Amazing as well.

DELICIOUS!  My Chicken Bellagio was exactly the taste I wanted.  Savory, breaded juicy chicken, a salty and chewy bite of prosciutto, lemony hint of the arugula, and basil pasta.  Plus was our server was awesome.

Ordered them last evening and one of them dish turned out great and the other was below par compared to the usual experience. Right from ordering the food to giving feedback about the food - the service was much much below par compared to what is norm at Cheesecake Factory. The waiter was least interested, sighed profusely and made it clear that he was annoyed when we mentioned about the undercooked pasta. He then went inside, tasted it and apologized for the good, but of course with a very irritated face. It seemed like he was super busy with tons of other things and was glad to be out of our way. Noticed his service at next table wasn't any different compared to ours.

Deb K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,13,,1.0,2/11/2017,My husband and I have been to Numerous Cheesecake Factory and Grand Luxe restaurants throughout the US as they are one of our favorite restaurants. We recently moved to San Jose CA and  went to the restaurant at Westfield Mall on Steven's Creek Rd.  It was so disappointing. We waited over 45 mins for our food so we had to take it to go. My husband ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich which had no tomato sauce on it and the waiter said the fries weren't ready.  We thought we would give the restaurant another try using their curbside service.  Again we ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich and another entree. When we arrived at the curbside parking I called their number which rang for 5 mins and I was then transferred to the bakery and held for 4 mins and was hung up on. My husband then went inside and waited in line for our order.  And yet again- no sauce on the sandwich. He then talked to the manager who simply said - sorry.  The service here is horrible and I would really discourage anyone from going to this particular location.  They truly create a horrible experience for this otherwise very reputable restaurant brand.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=360

I didn't write a review right away just because of the horror but I definitely don't want them to think that they got off scott free without me telling anyone what happened. In the middle of our meal a cockroach crawled up on the table. The managers initial response was that he wished that he ""could see the cockroach"" and that he was  ""surprised that a cockroach would be in the dining room with all of these people"" I informed him number one that I used to be a pest control operator and number two that the fact that a cockroach was in the dining room meant that their kitchen had some serious trouble. But the cockroach granted him his wish and reappeared.  They offered to move us to a new table and they offered me a new entre, REALLY!!! it amazes me that they think I would want to eat another crumb of food out of a kitchen that is clearly infested with cockroaches.

Faith O.,"San Jose, CA",16,63,360,1.0,1/24/2014,"OVERRATED!! My first exposure to the infamous Cheesecake Factory was a total let down. Food was NOT HOT and there was a LACK of SERVICE. Its no different than going to these other chain restaurants...maybe worse. In fact, I think I may have been exposed to food poisoning...because my stomach was rumbling the next day. But let me tell you what my friends and I had to have this violence occur in my stomach: -Fried Mac & Cheese $9.95 --Description: Crispy Crumb Coated Macaroni and Cheese Balls. Served over a Creamy Marinara Sauce. --Mac & Cheese was gooey and cheesy, fried cheese is alway good, but it wasn't piping hot --marinara sauce was so bland  -Tex Mex Eggrolls $10.95 --Description: Spicy Chicken, Corn, Black Beans, Peppers, Onions and Melted Cheese. Served with Avocado Cream and Salsa. --Egg roll skin wasn't fried crispy enough, skin was a bit dough on some parts, otherwise nothing special -Dynamite Shrimp $6.95  --Description: Crispy Tempura Shrimp Tossed with Our Spicy Dynamite Sauce --Fried lightly, but when it got cold, it wasn't crunchy and nice anymore --Shrimp was really skinny and there was A LOT of breading and there was a lack of seasoning...tossed with spicy dynamite sauce?? Where's the sauce? -Pasta Da Vinci $16.95 --Description: Sautéed Chicken, Mushrooms and Onions in a Delicious Madeira Wine Sauce Tossed with Penne Pasta and Parmesan --Nice mushroom taste, chicken was soft and moist --Pasta was not al dente...way too chewy -STUFFED CHICKEN TORTILLAS 14.95 --Description: Corn Tortillas Stuffed with Spicy Chicken, Covered with Melted Cheese, Green Onion, Tomatillo Sauce and Cilantro. Served with Grilled Corn Cakes, Black Beans, Salsa and Sour Cream --The grilled corn cakes tasted good, the corn was sweet and the cake was crispy --Everything else was bland -Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake $7.50 --Description: Pineapple Cheesecake Between Two Layers of Moist Buttery Pineapple Upside-Down Cake --It was OK. Too much warm whip cream. I felt I got jipped because the size of the cheese cake was small. --Pineapple cake was heavy like fruit cake -TIRAMISU CHEESECAKE $7.50 --Description: Our Wonderful Cheesecake and Tiramisu Combined into one Amazing Dessert! --Nothing Amazing about it. I don't even remember the taste. -FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE $7.50 --Description:Banana Cream Cheesecake Topped with Bavarian Cream and Fresh Sliced Bananas --They mixed artificial banana flavoring in the cheese cake and that was all I tasted. The so called ""bavarian"" cream was no different from the whip cream from my pineapple cheesecake. -CAFE MOCHA $4.95 --Description:Espresso, Chocolate, Steamed Milk, Whipped Cream --Tasted really chalky and powderly --Temporarily disabled my taste buds Overall: 1 star for ""meh"" food and  service. My stomach still hurts a bit when I think about this place. The service felt like what I would get at a Asian restaurant. If I wanted that, I would have gone to one. Our waiter seem very unethusiastic and inattentive to us. He didn't refill our drinks or really checked up on us. The ""free"" bread was barely warm and it was hard. Our utensils were placed ON the table (OMG do they even clean that??) and the soda my friends got were flat...maybe because the soda pitchers were sitting across from us the entire night?--OR maybe they were ice tea as someone here pointed out...ANYWAY...it took awhile for our food to come out.When we went there, it was packed! We had to wait for them to call my name in the lobby and you can barely hear them...I really don't recomend coming here unless you love waiting....waiting for your seat, waiting for your food, waiting for your waiter, waiting for your check...OMG...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=640

Our server tonight was Daniel, who absolutely blew us away.  I can't say enough good things about this experience, seriously. The food was fantastic, (try the clam chowder).... as I am used to with Cheesecake Factory, but tonight Daniel and his service stepped up the game. I will now choose Valley Fair Cheesecake factory over Oakridge every time I choose to dine there.  It's like this guy (Daniel) appeared out of nowhere, refilling our drinks, checking up to see how we were, or just holding a friendly conversation while taking our order.  To top it all off, at the end of our meal, he brought us lemon scented hot towels... Where am I.... A spa? But seriously. Major points because my girlfriend and I had lettuce wraps so my hands were feeling it.  Overall five freakin stars. Will dine again, just to sit in Daniel's section.

Instead the hostess forgot about me.  I sat there for 10 mins and finally asked someone else if it would be ready soon.  They told me I needed to check in at the bakery counter!  So I ended up waiting another 15 mins while that person checked on my order.  Stupid me.  I thought ok, well I know things are busy there... I'll give it another shot.  This time I waited for 15 mins. to find out I forgot my wallet.  BUT I had my check book.  I pleaded with the catering hostess to take a check and I would return as soon as I dropped off the order at my office (40 people were waiting for lunch!!!).  I would return right after and pay with a credit card.  I promised her she could cash the check if I didn't come back and it would NOT bounce.  Her answer:  ""I'm sorry, it's against our policy to accept checks"".  Here is $550 worth of food sitting in my car and she's going to take it back to the kitchen.  Not sure what she would do with it.  I told her I've order multiple times with them for $500+ catering orders and I wouldn't reneg on them.  No can-do is her answer.   I told her I WOULD NEVER COME BACK AGAIN and this would get a negative YELP review.  She didn't care one bit.

Michael K.,"Santa Clara, CA",503,769,47,3.0,3/17/2014,"The wait is usually very long for this location, but I usually have a good time at Cheesecake Factory because of the service, atmosphere, and beautiful dining decor. Our favorite dishes are: Ahi Tartare: This is great starter dish, but it's tiny, so I recommend ordering one for every two people if they all want some. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: OOhhhhh this one is good! A good amount of kick, great amount of chicken and shrimp, but a less than impressive amount of noodles in my opinion. However, this is super filling and super tasty. Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: This one is delicious as well! Asparagus, chicken, and penne pasta with yummy spicy chipotle cream sauce. Pretty much all of their cheesecakes I've tried were delicious. I love the Oreo, the Kahlua Coffee, and the Strawberry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=520
Wendy Y.,"Fremont, CA",295,615,614,4.0,2/15/2015,"I've been to this particular branch several times and I always have a great dining experience. It's pretty difficult to find parking around here since it is located at the busy Valleyfaire and so many people eat here on a daily basis. Just a note: be prepare to wait on most days! They don't take reservations after 5pm, so I do suggest getting there early or just be prepared to wait.  The amount of different food on the menu is pretty vast. I absolutely love their bread, especially the wheat ones. It's so tasty and we always get refills every time. I don't usually get appetizers here just because I know the entree would be enough for me and I need to order a cheesecake no matter how full I am. You're at the Cheesecake Factory, how can you not order a slice of delicious cheesecake?! As for the entrees, I do tend to get their pastas though. They're all so delicious and very consistent. My two all-time favorites would be the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. They have always been pretty consistent to be and I absolutely love them!  As for dessert, all of their cheesecakes are just so great. I do go for the Red Velvet because I absolutely love red velvet. As compared to the other cakes, it's not as sweet and there's that cake-yness to it. Most are just straight up cheesecake or chocolate and that's a little too strong and too thick for me. I do love cheesecake, but eating a whole slice of cheesecake by yourself is a little too much.  Overall, I enjoy dinning here with friends and family. I always have a great time here and I will definitely be back. You really can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=520

Our waiter was friendly and refilled our bread and water when we asked. I thought the service could've been more attentive, but he was serving everyone in the area we were seated. One of the best parts of The Cheesecake Factory is that the menu is huge, so there's something for everyone. Of course, the warm complimentary bread is delicious, especially the wheat one. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, which came in a huge portion (I took half of it home). The pasta was delicious and cooked al dente with a light wine sauce, so it wasn't heavy or greasy. I noticed that I wasn't offered fresh parmesan on my pasta unlike the couple next to me--I'm not sure if it's only offered for specific pastas, but it wasn't a huge deal. The rest of my family ordered the Factory Combinations (two meats) and we were all satisfied with their meals. At the end of our meal, four staff members came to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to my twin sister and I, and also surprised us with small ice cream sundaes too! We already had cake at home for dessert, so we passed on the cheesecake this time.

It seems ridiculous both to not take reservations for large parties, or to miss by 2x on a wait time, and to seat large parties significantly out of order from their arrival time. On top of all of that, they were rude, unapologetic, and generally did their very best to attempt to dismiss us, which includes the manager, and he was particularly rude, sarcastic and combative.

Told me once they ran out of Steak  Dianne, so I ordered Thai glazed salmon and the manager came by to tell me they don't make it anymore and I should try some chicken curry dish because it was similar to salmon--unbelievable. They need new management and a lesson in customer service. The hot grilled chicken for the salad was cold from the fridge and a different manager finally came to apologize.  The waitress asked us if we wanted water after all our food was finally finished, did not bring a soup spoon for the soup at our table despite two waiters being asked and my brother in law had to go search for one.

A month later...I placed an order to go again for my brother who wanted the meat loaf and I ordered my cheesecake again. Yet again, they took about 30 minutes to get me the food I had placed 30 minutes prior!  When I got home, they didnt even pack the cheesecake!  I should have checked before I left to see if it was in there, but I had already waited the 30 minutes and just wanted to get out to beat rush hour. Finally, I came in to eat with my friend and we waited 30 minutes to be seated (there was no one there at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon).  Once we sat down, no one came to serve us for another 15 minutes... with a completely empty restaurant!

With the hustle and bustle of the crowed and a full bar.  That my cousin wanted to have a drink before dinner.  So we meet at the bar she had a Peach sunrise blended drink.  She just loved it.  The menu is so big and so many great items to choose from I had the Herb Roast Chicken the sauce it sat on was absolutely awesome !  They give you about a half a chicken.  it came with mashed red potatoes, and carrots.  The plate was so good ! I could n't finish the place so I did take alot to go home with me.  I also couldn't resist taking home a cheese cake with strawberry's on top.   Service was excellent, the waitress was very attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=540

Said it was a piece of the basket they cook it in (I think that was supposed to be comforting). At the end, they didn't comp the calamari, so I had to ask for at least half off.

Expected: A ridiculous wait.  Arrived at 8:02pm and was told it would be 40 minutes. Unexpected:  At 9:03pm decided to ask why they are running so behind, as I saw two other couples that arrived after us get seated.  The hostess claimed they had already paged us which is complete BS as I had the pager in my hand the entire time sitting with the herd at the foyer with my 8 month pregnant wife, so I was not pleased. However, they did get us seated immediately after realizing their error, but took a while to get seated once they call you up with your pager. Our waiter, Christian was terrible.  Initially a waitress named Jenny got our order and I wish she would have remained our waitress.  This dude never came back to ask if we needed water and only until the very end did he fill up our cups.  Completely ridiculous.  I know they are busy, but come on, do your job.

I kindly asked for my cousin and I to be sat somewhere with some kind of stroller space since my toddler was sleeping and they immediately rejected me by exaggerating on the waiting time for a bigger booth. (30-50) minute wait considering it wasn't busy at the time I was there. And now moving on with the server, who didn't seem she knew what she was doing she took forever on getting us our food !

Jane Q.,"San Jose, CA",2,21,20,1.0,3/1/2016,"I've been to this specific location many times in the past but this review is about my visit last night. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by at this location to have a couple of drinks and order some salads. We arrived around 8 o'clock on February 29th. We sat at the bar.  Cheesecake factory makes really good Mojitos and just a few days ago I was at this location and ordered one and it was really good but the Mojito that I ordered last night wasn't that well done. My boyfriend ordered double gin and soda and he said it was good.  As for food I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad and I can't believe they were OK with serving me that gross tasting salmon. The salmon tasted old and it was cold. It took longer than the usual to have it served to us so I think they might have left it at the counter for a while until they picked it up to serve it.  Also,When I ordered my salad I asked for plate of bread which is the complementary bread that they serve to every customer but every time I stop by they automatically serve it,this time though I had to ask for it twice until I got it and the quality of the bread was pretty much the same as the salmon that I had on my salad, old and cold.  After taking two bites from the salmon I couldn't help but feel so grossed out by it so I pushed my plate to the side and our server asked if I wanted a box for my food and I had to tell him that it didn't taste god at all and the bread did not taste fresh. The server asked if I wanted to order something else off the menu , but worrying that somebody's going to spit in my food I didn't order anything else. It was disappointing and the server, even though he asked if I wanted something else, he didn't seem to care that my experience wasn't pleasant at all. Service wasn't special and food was gross. I don't think that's the general quality that's served here but it definitely wasn't good quality last night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=400

We were ignored by the waiter. Then I ordered a burger which the waiter brought out 40+ minutes later without the fries! Then told me the fries were on their way.

The waiter got it wrong and brought me pasta with tomato sauce. They had to take it back and remake my original order, which came out super soggy and watery!! It is probably the worst carbonara I've ever had. It was more like a soup!! So disappointed!  My friend ordered a gluten free burger and they brought out a regular burger which they almost served to her. Both of us have gluten allergies so these kinds of mistakes cannot happen. This would be a huge liability!  They don't offer a single gluten free cheesecake option on their menu. Can you believe that? Another disappointment.  Cheesecake needs to step up their game on gluten free menu offerings or else I'm never coming back here.  I could've made a huge commotion about these screw ups but I didn't want to deal with the drama. It was the new year and so I just wanted to be chill about things...

The food here, depending on what you get, is usually pretty good. I go here semi-regularly, here are my favorites:  Appetizers:  *Fried Mac N Cheese*- Delicious! Must try! I order it every time, but beware, don't let them get cold! Eat them PIPING HOT! Crispy outer layer holds well, with gooey EXTREMELY cheesy shell mac inside. I can't resist, it comes with 4, and they are fairly large.  *Potstickers*- Potstickers are potstickers, the sauce is amazing!  Entrees:  *Crusted Chicken Romano* I believe it comes with pasta which I do not care for, so I always sub. for mashed potatoes.  *Orange chicken* Truly one of my absolute favorites here, fried chicken with sweet orange sauce, amd the rice here really good! (Weird, I know, because its just steamed white rice, but it goes so well with the sauce!)  My sister, brother and dad pretty much always enjoy the *Chicken Madeira* which I know is very popular. Cheesecake:  *Tuxedo* ALL TIME FAVORITE. Have been eating this cheesecake since I was a kid! (I should really be a chubster..) *White Chocolate Raspberry* If you like raspberry at all, YOU MUST TRY THIS, if you haven't had anything White Chocolate & Raspberry you need to seriously make it a priority, haha, because it is the BEST combonation in the WORLD!  *Oreo* Standard oreo cheesecake. Pretty f***ing good!  Raspberry lemonade is definitely recommended!  The interior is beautiful! Kind of fancy but not like you need to dress up. Place is kept clean, bathrooms and eating areas, along with small waiting area (which gets crowded durimg rush hours) are all nicely maintained.

Yeah the food portions are huge and it is like a fancier Applebee's or something. I've been here a couple times for dinner and the prices are around $15 for plates. The portions are pretty big so you will probably have leftovers. A negative is that the wait is around 45 minutes My review will be based off of their famous desserts! There are soooo many delicious slices of cheesecake/cake to choose from and it was just so hard to choose one. I ended up making a great decision and got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cake. MY GOODNESS. EVERYTHING YOU WANT AND MORE. Peanut butter, chocolate and I even found a piece of butterfinger on the bottom. It is VERY rich and thick so I only finished half and saved the other half for the next day. In my head I thought, it is just one cheesecake, how bad can it be? I looked up the calorie count online and I almost fainted at how ridiculous it is. IT IS 1300 calories!!!! hahaha I LOLed when I saw this but it was sooo worth it.  Overall, the entrees are alright and the dessert is bomb. **TIPS** 1) Watch those calories when you choose a dessert. It will go straight to your hips.

Even though I used to work here, the only real problem that I have with it is that the food is SO heavy. I ordered the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes which are always so delicious. Even though it is an appetizer, it is so heavy and large that I was able to eat it as an entree. Everything you order comes in a huge portion, which is good for the price, but not on your waistline. They are great at accommodating large groups, but it still takes quite some time since they do not take reservations. I would recommend for one person in your party to come early about an hour to an hour and a half and put your name down. Then plan that whatever time they quote you add 15 to 20 mins on top of that. Once you get your time just head to the mall and relax. That lobby gets so crazy, just standing in there gives me a headache.

That was four weeks ago (I assumed it would come in 1-2 days) and still no card. And even getting him to make that gesture in the first place was like pulling teeth.  I have had Eureka in Cupertino or Town in San Carlos make mistakes and they do not hesitate to make it right.

Responding to Yelp reviews and making empty promises about improved service next time is NOT taking responsibility for your screwups.  I'd call it ""for show"" damage control.

SK L.,"Folsom, CA",9,160,,2.0,7/31/2014,"I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake factory!  However, I can't think of a time where I was disappointed this much.  This was the first time that I came to this branch.  I went for dinner, and it was not a big surprise that there was a wait, which I don't mind because their good food was worth it.   The workers seating us were really nice and professional.  Our waiter was excellent!   However, I timed the length of time to get my food and it took 28 minutes to get my favorite entree, the jambalaya pasta.  I could tell that our waiter had no control bringing the food over quicker.  He was very kind and let us know it was coming.  He came by our table multiple times, so that made our experience tolerable.  When I finally received my food, the noodles were all stuck together, over cooked, and mushy.  The chicken was over cooked, as it was really tough.  The shrimp was cooked ok.  I probably ate about 1/4 of it just because I was so hungry, and then I couldn't take it anymore and just asked for a box just to look kind to the waiter.  If the food is going to come out that late, I better get food cooked properly. The food also came out so late that we didn't even have time to have one of our most favorite desserts, their oreo cheesecake.  The kids were already going to go nuts because of being there so long and we had to leave.       If food is coming out this late, I at least expect a manager, especially from a popular restaurant like this one to warn us about really slow service or giving a little extra to make the dining experience outstanding, which is what I'm sure the corporate expects from each restaurant.  I wanted to complain so much to the waiter, but because I knew it was beyond his control about the food being brought in quicker and the food being cooked properly, I just let it be.  This should be a 1 star rating but I put it at 2 because of the excellent service by our waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=560

I had the Peach Smoothie that was large enough to share between two and it was garnished with a pineapple wedge and strawberry. The waiter started us off with sourdough and honey wheat bread along with butter. We decided to go family style on the appetizers we had;  Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls Crispy Crab Wontons  Fried Mac N Cheese I decided to have the lunch Cobb Salad, which is still a large portion if I may add. I thought the Smoothie was delicious, refreshing and I appreciated the use of ripe fruit as garnish. The appetizers were good, the summer rolls are TCF's take on Vietnamese Spring Rolls and were edible even for my dad who is picky about places that try to recreate his homeland's food. The Crispy Crab Wontons were incredibly filling and dense with crab meat these have a spicy bite! And the Fried Mac N Cheese was just plain delicious fried to perfection, gooey inside and sitting on a bed of creamy tomato sauce. My Cobb Salad was just that, it was kind of overwhelming and I wasn't found that as I chewed away at my salad there was slices of chicken hidden fork deep into my dish. I do love me some good ol' Bleu Cheese though. For dessert, Banana Cream and Red Velvet cheesecake to share amongst ourselves. It's called The Cheesecake Factory for a reason. These are by far my favorites! I don't know what kind of food this place serves, they have an extensive menu with all kinds of flavors like texmex, asian and american.

Luicidal S.,"San Jose, CA",392,17,14,1.0,7/10/2015,"My coworkers and I come here almost once a week for lunch together during their ""Happy Hour."" It's a great place for us to connect on a weekly basis and we've had no problems in the past. This time was different. Four of us arrived in the bar and lounge area and business was understandably slow for a weekday. Regardless of slow business, our server took 15-20 minutes to even greet us. We then proceeded to order and asked simple questions about the menu and drink specials. She did not know any answers in regards to pricing or to what comes with certain items. The brainless server had to ask the bartender near by all our questions. She then returned and exclaimed to us that she ""hadn't worked a Happy Hour in over a year in a half.""  I knew then we were in for a fun lunch yet we proceed to enter our order. My coworker asked for a burger WITHOUT Thousand Island dressing, my other coworker asked for a small side of fries. Both of these orders were brought back incorrectly. The burger was smoothed in dressing, and we had a huge bowl of large fries in front of us. The server then decided to disappear for another 20 minutes and we were greeted with a new server and we were told he was ""taking over."" The first server wasn't off of work, she couldn't handle working with multiple tables and cowardly made her way towards the back. They attempted to correct our orders but that took another 20 minutes, by that time we had to go back to work. We asked to speak to a manager, perhaps they could comp one of our items or maybe just a simple apology. We received neither. Instead THE MANAGER GRACE, proceeded to argue back and forth with my coworker to the point of shouting. As a manager this type of behavior is unacceptable. She finally comped our burger which was 5 dollars by the way, and then took ONE DOLLAR off our incorrect fries order.  Never will we return to this location and we spread the word to the rest of our team as well. Sometimes people don't want things for free, people just want to be heard and acknowledged.

Alexander E.,"San Pablo, CA",355,636,830,4.0,1/4/2013,"It's pretty hard to resist The Cheesecake Factory. Who doesn't like to over indulge in classic American dishes? Followed with a 1,200 calorie dessert. It was Game 3 of the World Series and the Giants were out of town. We decided to visit The Cheesecake Factory and watch the game and get a bite to eat before heading over to the Winchester Mansion. The wait was surprisingly short, roughly 15 minutes or so on a Saturday afternoon.  The Cheesecake Factory menu is no piece of pie. That baby has about 12 pages of 2 person dishes, yet I had an idea of what I wanted to go with: Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It's never let me down, but once I looked at its nutrition content, I reconsidered. After poring over the menu, I finally decided on going with two items from the SkinnyLicious menu: Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos (Mexican); and Flatbread Pizza (Margherita).  The wrap tacos came out and were much bigger than I expected. A trio of butter lettuce leaves filed with chicken and stuffed with avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, roasted corn salsa, and crema. The tacos were a great choice but my only complaint were that they were difficult to handle. Additionally, one of the leaves was already ripped, which made everything fall out immediately. If you have trouble handling the tacos, you can easily make it into a small salad. As tasty as the tacos were, the flatbread pizza was even better. The portion was generous and larger than I expected. The crust was crispy without being burnt and the mozzarella, tomato, and basil all made for a freshly made (healthy) pizza.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with The Cheesecake Factory. The bar was a little busier than usual because of the World Series game, but other than that, it was pretty straight forward on getting a table; our waitress was friendly and gave great service, and the food was great. I would have loved getting my typical Crispy Chicken Sandwich, but I was in no position to break the calorie bank. If you're looking to eat healthy at The Cheesecake Factory, I suggest exploring the SkinnyLicious menu, as the two items I had were delicious, and there's even alcoholic drinks on the menu.,  Ambiance: 4 Stars (out of 5) Food: 4 Stars (out of 5) Service: 4 Stars (out of 5) Price: $$ Overall: 4 Stars (out of 5) Pros: + THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY + Large menu + New SkinnyLicious menu + Portions + Value + Location Cons: - Crowded at times",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=580

This, though, was a total disaster. If there was an option for zero stars, I would give it.  Yes, the wait is long, but that is the case in pretty much every location anywhere close to a meal time. What was confusing about it, though, is that they give you the pager but when it goes off they just have you wait some more. When my party was called, there were so many people just standing around the front desk that it took us about forty five seconds to reach the desk, but by the time we got up there, the hostess had already crossed our names off and was calling the next group. Still, they took us, but it was another half hour after being seated that our server actually introduced herself and offered to bring water. I understand it was busy but we saw her only that one time before she asked us to order. So, we ordered drinks, appetizers, and our meals at the same time. We got our drink after about twenty minutes, but we got our bread at the same time the wrong appetizer arrived!! In the end we got our appetizer at the same time we got our meals. We had been sitting for almost two hours before we got our food.   My boyfriend said the fettuccine alfredo was just okay, and I thought that the shrimp scampi was about three stars. The sauce and the pasta were good but the shrimp was very, very chewy (overcooked or undercooked?). It wasn't bad so I didn't send it back or anything, although that wouldn't have been possible because we hadn't seen our server since we ordered.  When we were finished eating, I spoke to our server since it was my boyfriend's birthday and I asked what they could do and she said they give a little cup of ice cream and sing Happy Birthday, which sounded good to me. Well, they never did. There were at least three other birthdays in between the time I spoke to her and the time we left, including one at the next table over, but not for my guy. I felt really bad because this was the only thing we ended up being able to do for his birthday.  While we were eating, there was a particularly fussy toddler across the aisle from us who threw a bowl on the ground, and the hundreds of sharp little pieces hit myself and a few other people nearby, but no one came to clean anything up even though a few of us were sitting there with cuts all over our legs. Our area wasn't very clean at all, likely because they were trying to get people in an out as quickly as possible. There was a fork and napkin underneath our table and not until we received our check did anything off of our table get cleared.  In the end, I wish I'd given a smaller tip.

Kimberly T.,"New York, NY",40,102,321,2.0,6/23/2013,"Disclaimer: this is only about the service, not the food. I am sure the food is wonderful.  I was planning a banquet for around 20 people and had one of my members call this location to try to reserve a table on a Monday night. They told him that while they did not do reservations past 5:30 or so, they were not busy on Monday nights and that they should be able to accommodate us easily.  Because they had reassured us that it would be fine, we decided to hold our banquet at The Cheesecake Factory. I told my entire group to meet there at 7. I got there 15 minutes early just in case. When I got there, however, I was informed that the wait time would be at LEAST an hour and a half. I informed them about what my member had been told, but they said that no one should ever have told us that since it was impossible to promise seating.  As if they thought that this was a viable solution, they told me that if I split up my banquet into 2 groups of 10, they could get us in within 45 minutes. Needless to say, you can't split up a banquet. And even if you could, that wait time is still way too long. The rest of my party arrived dressed nicely for a banquet but were unable to be seated until well after we were promised. This forced us to frantically call different restaurants in the area to see who could hold a party of 20 right at that moment with no reservation. Luckily, California Pizza Kitchen had just enough room, and we were able to walk there to hold our banquet.  Regardless though, Cheesecake Factory should not have made false assurances they couldn't keep. This is not a rant, but rather a reflection on how Cheesecake Factory could've easily ruined our end-of-the-year banquet simply because they tried to earn our business by saying they could seat us quickly, when they knew very well that they couldn't keep a promise like that.

Perfectly soft yet crisp outside pan fried chicken breast finished with prosciutto and arugula sitting atop al dente pesto pasta with just the right amount of yummy white cream sauce mmmm don't be afraid to overload it with Parmesan cheese either. Mmmm makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Definitely go for the Shepard's Pie if you want something filling and buttery tasting! Tender and flavorful chunks of ground beef sautéed with peas, slivered carrots & cucumbers, onions, mushrooms! crowned with a hefty portion of their to die for buttery mashed potato goodness! You know something is good if you savor the flavor even when completely full. Their mashed potatoes hit the spot every time! Expect leftovers to take home unless you're sharing this dish.  The shrimp bistro pasta is worth a shot too-- lightly breaded and fried shrimp on a bed of pasta with lemon cream sauce and now that I think of it-- capers! I love those! The macaroni and cheese burger is ok. Their Caesar salad is good! Cheesecakes I've tried & recommend: -Red velvet: smooth and delish! Plenty of white chocolate curls on the edge, moist red velvet cake alternating layers with their smooth original cheesecake -Oreo dream extreme: my new favorite! Traditional Oreo crust beneath a mound of yummy cheesecake filled with whole Oreo cookies! It's more complicated than that but just take a look at a picture =] top it all off with chocolate cream icing and whipped cream -Snickers: a must try if you love chocolate bars! Each bite is filled with creamy cheesecake and chunks of caramel, peanuts, nougat, and of course chocolate!  -Adam's peanut butter fudge ripple: the favorite of one of my best friend's (she's in love with peanut butter) peanut butter cups, fudge, chocolate, nuts, peanut butter topping that's seriously too sweet but this cheesecake has got it going on!   I've also tried the one with macadamias/caramel/white chocolate and the caramel pecan turtle-- they're alright. I'm not a big fan of caramel IN my desserts. Maybe on it is fine.  -Chocolate chip cookie dough: simple and sweet, reminds me of the days we ate cookie dough straight from the package, or was that last week ... One waiter I must compliment is Jesse J. He strives to be the best without even breaking a sweat-- it's all natural to him. My friend and I had him twice, and good thing we did because the first time he took over for another waiter that really shouldn't have been working when it was obvious he didn't care much for the customers. Jesse was the relief we needed after our past server was seen in the back chatting with fellow workers when I needed to follow up on my order when it was his fault in the first place for not getting it right (I had asked the waiter for a macaroni and cheese burger and then he asks me what kind of burger I wanted?? I thought he meant there were choices in patty so I said I didn't know and he wrote down classic. Umm hello?! Mac & cheese please! Plus I said I wanted the Caesar salad instead of fries and he asks ""with fries?"" DUDE! What planet are you living on?!?!) Enough with the nameless waiter I didn't bother getting the name of!   Jesse goes above and beyond! He always anticipates our needs right before we ask! Our waters were consistently filled, we were given more bread without complaints, he asked about boxes for leftovers, and didn't even ask for the 50% cheesecake Facebook print out a few months ago-- he just glanced at them AND knew which cheesecakes to deduct from (ordered cheesecake to go also). Some servers use the discount on the cheapest item on the bill but ours didn't and I'm happy for that. Businesses should have more employees like this-- we're sure to come back because of people like him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=600

Andrea W.,"Fremont, CA",149,1829,990,3.0,7/19/2015,"I came here with a group of 8 around 6PM on a weekend, and we waited for about 30-40 minutes for a table. We were seated in a booth and promptly served menus and water, as well as drinks. There's complimentary sourdough bread and brown? bread (I'm not entirely sure what it was, maybe oat bread? My friends said it was somewhat sweet though), and the bread was very fresh and soft. The waiter was pretty good about coming over to see whether we were ready to order and to refill our water, as well as coming back to ask how our food was during the meal and clearing our plates afterward. I ordered a cajun jambalaya pasta, and it was alright. There was a LOT of pasta (there was green pasta as well as the usual white pasta), and the chicken was pretty tender. The shrimp wasn't very fresh though, and there seemed to be a lack of sauce. There was somehow a lot of oil though. The sauce wasn't very spicy, and I think there could have been more toppings to balance out the amount of pasta in the dish. Either that, or there should have been less pasta. For the amount of food, the price is decent seeing that this is a higher-class restaurant - my pasta was around $18 pre-tax pre-tip. I also shared a strawberry cheesecake with my friends. The whipped cream is really good! Very thick and not overly sweet. Yum. Each cheesecake slice is around $8 pre-tax pre-tip, but I guess that's excusable seeing that this is Cheesecake Factory.

Or you can always opt for the bar area if seats are available.  Cheesecake Factory has got to be one of my fav places to eat at. Extensive menu!!! Their menu is basically a book! So much to choose from. It can be overwhelming for someone who's never eaten here before. But because I've eaten here so much, there's always those dishes I keep going back for!  Cocktails .. My favorites are the Ritz Martini and Ultimate margarita. Ritz martini basically has Courvoisier, Champagne, Cointreau and Pomegranate Juice. It's soooo good & strong! When I'm in the mood for tequila, can't go wrong with that ultimate margarita (stronger Version of their margarita?) I believe it's top shelf also.  Favorite Appetizers.. Avocado egg rolls, Mac and cheese balls, ahi tuna tartare ( wish they gave you a bigger portion though!) Entrees... Louisiana chicken pasta and pasta da Vinci are to die for! So flavorful. Pasta da Vinci is a bit on the sweeter side because of the Marsala sauce. The sauce for the Louisiana chicken pasta is a Cajun style spicy. When I'm in the healthy mood, I opt for the ahi tuna tatake salad. The ahi tuna is perfection. The best ahi tuna salad compared to other places I've tried.  And lastly... Cheesecake!! at this point I'm usually already super full, but either get the cheesecake to go or continue to stuff my face. Can't go wrong with the tiramisu or red velvet cheesecake. My two fav!

We did not have bread on the table for over 30 mins and we were ordering appetizers before anything else came.  Food was average. Nonetheless we waited and we ate, but it was the worst experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. We asked for a refill on our drinks not 1 but 4 times. Not exaggerating at all. After the 3rd time the waiter grabbed our cups for the refills but never came back with the drink until we asked for the 4th time. I really believe our waiter was drinking on the job. To top it off when we were getting ready to pay their computers crashed and we had to wait for the system to go up. HORRIBLE. The tables next to us were all running out of patience for service.

Nancy T.,"Morrisville, NC",506,95,313,1.0,3/28/2014,"Let me start off by saying this was probably the most annoying dining experience I have ever had.  We came in Thursday night around 7. The wait was about 20 minutes, not bad at all.  We were seated and the host handed us the menus. We started looking for what we wanted and decided rather quickly. 15 minutes had gone by, and we didn't even know who our server was. 5 more minutes and the server stops by our table to say she will be right back.  She comes back and asks us what we want to order. I ordered some chicken avocado sandwich and I asked to switch out the French baguette for a soft roll. Our server says that she doesn't think they have that but the menu did. I asked her to let me know so I could change my order if needed.  We also had to ask for the water and bread because she did not bring it out for us. We ordered and the food came out about 20 minutes later.  My friend ordered the same thing as me but she didn't ask for the baguette to be switched out. Our server never got back to me about the bread so I also got the baguette. Another 5 minutes go by without her checking on us. I send the food back to have the bread changed about 20 minutes after we get our food because that's when our server checked on us (finally) and it comes back 10 minutes later with the same thing!!!  By this time, the rest of my party was done eating so I didn't even want to deal with it being sent back again to be changed. I asked for the order to be cancelled with another server because ours was no where to be found. The manager was very understanding and cancelled the order right away.

Amy D.,"Fremont, CA",474,2309,5375,3.0,3/26/2014,"This review is just for the 2 cheesecake flavors I tried that we got to go. We went in on a weekday to pick up two slices of cheesecake, and tried: -Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake (Chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups in our Original Cheesecake w/Layers of Delicious Fudge Cake and Caramel,  ): Pretty good, but it was really sweet. I liked some of the layers more than others, and wished they didn't have the two layers of super sweet caramel and huge chunks of peanuts. The original cheesecake and fudge cake layers were really good, as was the peanut butter frosting on top. Although I liked most of the cheesecake, I don't think I would order it again over my other favorites. -Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake (Layers of Rich Brownie, Kahlua Cheesecake, Creamy Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Ganache,  ): Just ok- the Kahlua and coffee flavors were too strong and a little bitter for my liking. Although I really liked the creaminess of this cheesecake, I wouldn't order this flavor again.

Chantelina J.,"Fremont, CA",139,149,37,5.0,3/9/2015,"It's been a while since my husband and I went to a Cheesecake Factory. The last time we went, we were celebrating our marriage with family at the Union Square location in San Francisco. When we got here, we saw it was packed, but I knew that the wait would be long for bigger parties. Since it was just my husband and I, it only took 15 minutes for a table. And what's great was that it was just as the hostess said: 15 to 20 minute wait. Started off with a Blueberry Mojito for myself and Stella Artois for the hubby. Definitely get a Blueberry Mojito, always! They make it so yummy that I can't taste the alcohol and that can be dangerous for me because then I want more and I'll get drunk way faster than I can imagine. But that's a different story. I ordered the steak diane (medium rare) and herb crusted salmon combo which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. And I ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. My husband ordered the hibachi steak (medium rare) which also came with mashed potatoes and he ordered a side of corn succotash. SO GOOD!

Jimmy L.,"San Jose, CA",33,854,133,4.0,5/12/2014,"I've been here a few times over the last coupla years since my last review, and they have a consistently good formula going on.  Parking sucks, of course! Service and wait times suffer because of their volume in terms of food, drink, and larger parties, though am willing to sacrifice for the quality and servings you get in return for the decent price points.  I AM a foodie, and picky about it, and how it's served, etc. For now, this restaurant works well for me since they're not too formal, and yet they're not po-dunk, and it's a place to which I can go to with family, or if I just wanna have fun with friends. This last visit, though, I went with the Baja Chicken Tacos, which were good. The web description is as follows -  Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Avocado,Tomato, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Black Beans and Rice. They could've been ""slightly warmer"", though we had already been waiting a whole hour and 15 minutes for our table; not to mention the wait-time for food, so I wasn't about to send it back. Still pretty good, though.  The chicken was on the border being barely moist and still decent. Didn't taste the spice, either. Asked for extra avocado, though don't think they really added any extra, cuz each taco only had a quarter of an avocado on top of each one; the waiter claimed that they added extra. I stand by the Romano Chicken as my favorite, also the warm (rye, i think) bread, and vanilla cheesecake.  On the other hand, I DO set my expectations accordingly, and would still come back for more, considering the quality, amount, and quality that you get for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=660

On really busy days like Saturday's or during the lunch and dinner rush, expect service to be at a snail's pace. If you're with a large party, expect to wait about 40 min  or longer to be seated. I went with a party of seven last year, on a Tuesday night for dinner. We waited over 45 min until we were seated. Because of the long wait, we received a free appetizer.  Another time, my parents and I went for an early Sunday lunch, we were seated immediately but no one came to our table afterwards. We were the first people seated in the section but everyone seated after us was seen to first. After over 20 minutes of waiting for service (no one came to take our drink order) I finally got hold of a seating hostess and was told there was no server for our table. She hadn't come in yet.  So why the hell were we seated there? We were given a free meal and three free desserts for the grievous error on their part. We didn't go back for almost 4 months after that fiasco.

If you buy a $25 gift card, you can get a free cheesecake. The only thing is that there are restrictions but there is a very wide window to redeem them.  When we got there, it was very busy. It was expected because we came on New Years. The wait time to get a table was 2.5 hours!! This was around 7pm. We ended up just picking up our cheesecakes at the register. The line wasn't very long & we got our cheesecakes very quickly despite the crowd waiting in the lobby. My bf & I shared the caramel turtle pecan cheesecake. So good!

Our server, bless her little heart, she tried and I don't blame her but seriously....after she took our order, multiple tables sat down, received their food, and one even paid their bill, before we received our food. It should have been a red flag when the Manager stopped by and apologized for the wait.... But that was it, about 20 minutes later we received our food. No apologies from the server, no slight inclination as to why it took forever? Dumbstruck we ate our food, which was actually pretty good. I hope subbing chicken chorizo for Avocado and using egg whites only wasn't the hold up, but the table kept teasing me that it was :(  The size of the burrito was about the size of my head, no joke. This thing was as huge as a body builder's forearm, eyes glazed over, I dug in. Great flavor, fresh Avocado, slightly spicy (but we all know how much of a wimp I am). Instead of a side of beans, I got the Spanish rice, which was a great addition to the burrito. I have no complaints with my food, nor did anyone else at the table. The flavor was on point.

But at lest I came when I was cutting carbs, so that did limit how much damage I could do. There was still somehow a 10 minute wait even at 8:30 PM on a Monday night- very odd. We were seated relatively quickly though, at a table with lackluster service- not at all on par with my expectations for this restaurant. BF's dad had the worst luck here- ordered a margarita that was 80% tequila, first time I've seen him not finish a drink in quite some time. He also opted for the chicken tortilla soup, which had only one flavor: spice. Literally seemed like mush accented with pepper. Sent it back to a baffled-looking waitress who couldn't seem to understand why anyone wouldn't love that soup. Did not taste like any other chicken tortilla soup we've ever had, and not in a good way. Also had the salmon wontons, which were just okay. BF's mom had the luau salad which was surprisingly vibrant and huge- I boxed leftovers up and took to work for lunch today. Salad usually doesn't save, especially not when dressed, but other than the crunchy bits being soggy, it held up relatively well. Lots of peppers and a delicious dressing, though I can't recall what it was called and it probably had more calories in it than anything else on the table. BF and I opted to share the tuna tartare small plate and the Boston salad with bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch- salad was by far my favorite, it was huge and had plentiful amounts of the assorted toppings, just wish it was tossed prior to arriving at the table, as it was so dark in our particular booth that we didn't figure it out for a few minutes. The tuna was just okay- BF seemed to like it more than I did, and I liked the marinade at the bottom, but just wasn't really my thing. We wrapped up the meal with a slice of the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, shared between the four of us and still deadly- and surprisingly delicious! Crust is made of a pecan sandie cookie, which sounds amazing because it is. Highly recommend that. Our waitress was MIA most of our visit and stopped by to check on us once. Drinks didn't get refilled and  table was cleared in an awkward and clumsy manner that seemed to indicate she was in a hurry to leave, even though we hadn't ordered dessert- and we had to prompt her for a dessert menu in the first place. Very odd for a place known for their desserts. Will come back because there's a million things on the menu, but hoping for better service next time.

I ended up dropping by with a friend since we were in the area; we ended up waiting for around half an hour on a Saturday night, which wasn't too bad. The hostess did a good job of going through the line efficiently while still being polite. I was a bit astounded at the huge selection on the menu, but eventually settled on sharing the fried mac and cheese as an appetizer, and the Pasta Da Vinci. The mac and cheese was fairly hearty, although the center was still a bit lukewarm and not piping hot. The pasta dish had plenty of flavor and was actually quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, the heart attack-inducing portion sizes meant that I barely finished 1/5 of my main dish before admitting defeat. Definitely a very American-sized restaurant, both in terms of food and clientele, if you catch my drift. Sadly I was unable to try the namesake cheesecake for dessert.  Despite the restaurant being quite busy, our server was very attentive and friendly, popping up to refill waters and check on us periodically.

Really? Do wait staff in the Bay Area need a GPS, or are we supposed to be feel entitled they're serving us? A little friendly and appreciative service is the difference between the $5 tip you get compared to the $50 we were willing to give. If it had been left up to me you would have got $0.

Cheesecake Factory, what have you done to your cheesecakes? They taste bland and very uncreamy. Before they were rich and creamy, now they taste like sugar, thin sour cream and flavoring. And the cream used to be thick and OMG so good it should be illegal, but now tasteless and like regular whipping cream. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=500

However I'm only giving this place 4 stars because the food is okay, nothing extraordinary and the service is a hit or miss. Came around 2 today and oh my, it was packed! Parking sucks as always and the wait usually are about 20 mins to an hour. Their portions are huge, I can never finish my food so if your appetite is small, I suggest sharing a dish or you can always take it home for later on. Their cheesecakes are pretty amazing, and again one slice can make me full.

They serve free bread.  The squaw and sourdough fresh from the oven.   We ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad...scrumptious.  Tuna seared perfect...with a great salad mix , large beefsteak tomatoes avacado and ginger...cleaned the plate.  My son ordered Steak Dianne and really enjoyed it...such a large portion he didn't finish the smashed potatoes that were delicious .   Great service from Jaime T.

The bartenders were super attentive taking our drink orders promptly and giving us the awesome bread which I absolutely love.  We didn't have dessert, but still had the bread.  Go figure.  I'd never ordered a sandwich here before so here's what I had: Southwest Chicken Sandwich: Grilled Chicken Breast, Crushed Avocado, Tomato, Onion, Cilantro, Jalapeño Peppers and Chipotle Mayo on a Toasted French Baguette The above was just cut and pasted from the menu which I do quite often here on yelp since it's hard for me to remember everything I ate.  In one word, it was ""Yum!"" The toasted french baguette was nice and crispy and soft on the inside.  The Chipotle Mayo had a nice kick it which wasn't super spicy but gave everything a nice flavor.  Everything else was just icing on the cake.  Grilled chicken was great and was so the crushed avocado.  You can never have enough cilantro in my opinion so having this in the sandwich was awesome too.   If I had to pick a sandwich I would get this again.  Next time I'm coming back for the cheesecake.  1300 calories a slice can just kiss my you know what.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=500

Well to be fair it was not the sit and dine portion. It was the cheese cake bar area. After waiting in traffic I finally was able to get to the restaurant. The whole area in the entrance was packed but it consisted of diners. So the cheesecake area was empty and filled with employees just standing around. More so just chilling and chatting instead of taking my order.  I was then approached by a young lady with dark hair who heard me wrong. I then realized I had paid for the wrong size of cake. I asked some guy there to help me out and he just told me ""oh don't worry she will be right back"" It took her 20 mins to return while the others just stood there. When she had returned and I explained the problems she gave me a dirty look and got her supervisor and then the both proceeded to get me dirty looks.  I'm sure they realized that I was literally 2ft infront of them and I was able to hear all the huffing and puffing. I spoke loud enough, any louder and I would be yelling at her for my order.

Stephanie C.,"Redwood City, CA",4,363,5,3.0,8/20/2013,"It'd been a long time since I'd been to a Cheesecake Factory, so I had been hoping for pasta and had forgotten that their pasta apparently all has eggs in it (and I have a mild egg allergy). Oh well.  Instead I got the eggplant sandwich without the aioli, which was decent, but not stellar, and was actually surprisingly messy to eat. My companion got a pasta dish that I can't recall and we ordered the polenta fries as an appetizer. I very much liked the polenta fries, in spite of their lack of the structural integrity required to actually dip them in the marinara they come with :) My companion was disappointed by the lack of pumpkin cheesecake, but he didn't notice the seasonal note next to the item on the menu :P He did enjoy the cheesecake he got, but I think he'll want to come back for the pumpkin cheesecake come October, as that is a favorite dessert of his. The service was pretty clearly stretched thin, unfortunately. They were confused when we got back with our blinking table buzzer (perhaps they had mistakenly pinged us?) and we had to wait on the side for them to ""clear our table."" Our waitress, who was clearly trying quite hard, was speeding between several tables and took a while to get us our drinks and such.

When the bread is fresh and hot, it's also great. The few times where something was not up to par, the wait staff is usually very nice and good about fixing it.

Kevin D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,15,2,2.0,4/7/2013,"It was our first time at The Cheesecake Factory. And to start off with good: The decor is really nice! Probably too nice for the low-quality food and service, so maybe it set my expectations too high. This is a great place for cheap kids food, although my kid's cheese pizza tasted like soap. Life advice: Please do not get the fettuccine with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes, unless you enjoy tough chicken, Chef Boyardee sauce, and bland pasta. When our server asked how it was, I said, ""Not great, it's..."" but then she walked away. I wanted to order something else, so I waited for the server to come back. They didn't. I asked another server if they could get ours, and they said sure! And 10 minutes later, no one. So I went in back to ask for help, they said they'd be right over -- and still didn't! And another 10 minutes went by -- so I went back again! And like a bad joke, they said they'd be right over, and believe it or not, they still did not show up. They did offer to reduce our bill, but I didn't want that. I just wanted to know how we'd become invisible, and I really wanted to eat something besides the bread and my kid's soap pizza. I think I've been spoiled by good restaurants. To be fair, if you like food at Chili's or Applebee's, you'll probably like this.

I expressed to the manager that i had never felt so discriminated against in a restaurant like this ever. He gave me a less than sincere apology but assigned us a much better waiter named jonathan who we made sure got a good tip since he was helpfull and very attentive.  Never saw the manager again after our meal to see how we were doing... i guess he must have better things to do than follow up with his customers.

First we tried to call in advance hours earlier to let them know when we would be there and they insisted that we could not make a reservation even though we had a huge party so we said fine we will just come in. A few of us arrived earlier than others to check in our party and they told us it would be about an hour wait so we waited and then they gave away our table because 80% of our party had not arrived yet, we said fine. What really got to us was when we waited another 30 minutes and when we asked how much longer we were informed that they gave away our table again! They didn't even check in with us to see if the rest of our party had arrived and at the point we were only waiting on two people so yes 80% of our party was there. When I complained to the manager (Marsha) she said oh well you'll have to wait another 45 min! I told her that she was unprofessional and this was rediculous.

Stanley C.,"San Jose, CA",791,655,2706,5.0,9/3/2011,"CHEESECAKE FACTORY One of the staples of American dining at various shopping malls, Cheesecake Factory offers a huge menu of delicious eats, ranging from pasta to seafood to poultry/steak, salad, and of course... cheesecake. Their cheesecake is world-renowned and comes in many flavors that is sure to satisfy anyone and everyone. Some of my favorite dishes: (1) Pecan-Crusted Catfish: with Mashed Potatoes and sweet corn (2) Seared Tuna Tataki Salad: Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared and Served Rare with Avocado, Tomato and Mixed Greens Tossed with Wasabi Vinaigrette. (3) Pasta Carbonara: Spaghettini with Smoked Bacon, Green Peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce. Available with Chicken.  Cheesecake: (1) Blueberry Cheesecake - lots of blueberry flavor, although a bit too sweet (2) Mango/Key Lime Cheesecake - smooth and silky The dishes are all quite large, so you certainly won't leave the restaurant hungry. The cheesecake slices are heaven so satisfy your sweet tooth! The serving staff is ultra friendly and even sing you a Happy Birthday song if it's your special day.  Drawback: no reservations are taken at Cheesecake Factory, so it's a hit or miss depending on when you come. If it's a large party, be prepared to wait a long long long time!

However I am knocking off a star because the weekend before last I went to pick up a 7"" cheesecake to go. When I was ordering over the phone I was told only the strawberry and original were prepared. Any other flavor I would have to bake at home. My whole point in stopping by to pick up a cake was because I didn't have time to bake....it was annoying that I only had 2 options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=920
Erin H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",44,211,23,4.0,7/10/2011,"For some reason I always find myself at the cheesecake factory for various friends' birthday dinners. The last one was on saturday. I arrived late (oops) but the waitress was totally cool about it and offered me water and handed me a menu immediately.  I ordered the spaghetti with marinara sauce expecting overcooked pasta with icky sauce (because thats usually what happens at chain places like this) but I was pleasantly surprised. The pasta was well cooked and the sauce had the right balance of salty and sweet. 4 stars for sure. For dessert I ordered a slice of key lime cheesecake and it was delicious.  The birthday girl got a free sunday on which the waitress had written ""Happy Birthday Megan."" Nice touch! A few servers then proceeded to embarrass the hell out of her by singing Happy Birthday loudly, but I thought it was sweet.  My experience at this cheesecake factory has always been good so I would definitely recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=920
Delya S.,"Fremont, CA",210,251,22,3.0,1/17/2012,"My bestie was craving some cheesecake. Being as we met on her birthday, she chose (and would have) some Cheesecake Factory! We met with another pal on this last Sunday and it was pretty busy. The thirty minute wait wasn't terrible. The decor is nice: it's airy, dim, and marble-y. You could bring a date here without seeming as though you were being presumptuous, while still leaving the option for romance... on the table. ;o) When we were sat, Annie was breaking our server, Dan. Service was very efficient and personable. Annie felt like somebody who should sit down and join us girls. My Manhattan was tasty and was promptly served. My BFF seemed pretty darn happy with her Lemon Drop. She and I have a perfect arrangement where we share a miso glazed salmon with brown rice, which leaves almost enough room for a nibble of cheesecake. Our other friend was craving a small bite, but this is NOT the place to find, well anything, small... really. I think the richness of everything overwhelmed her. The cheesecake is just too darn sweet! And it has WAY too much whipped cream.  Anyway, CF is more like a 3.5 star place. Decor and service is higher. I quite like the salmon and I'll be back with my friend time and again, I'm sure. I'm just not confident that it deserves four stars. Food could be executed with a bit more subtlety and artistry for a higher rating. One does know they're at a chain, when at the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=920

This place has one of the biggest menus you have ever seen. You'd think that somewhere in this ""War and Peace"" of menus you'd be able to find something excellent. But no you won't be finding anything better than decent. I've tried too many things on this menu to list here because some of my friends seem to think that the food is worth anyones taste buds. Every time I get something new because it's never that good.  It's also about $4 more for plate than it should be. Mix the meh food and the new hole in your pocket and it equals a bad time.  Furthermore they don't take reservations and often are incredibly full. The wait is usually forever.  BUT the cheesecake! Yeah it's really good! Much like with the food I've tried oh so many flavors. But this time I have to say there is the opposite result. Everything is good. The cheesecake is just so rich and the crust so perfect. It's not even worth describing. You just have to try it to understand.  Once again it's pretty pricey but I think it's worth it. After all, you shouldn't eat a slice of this very often because with great taste comes great amounts of calories. But hey you should be able to splurge from time to time.  So do yourself a favor.

I love/hate how they have so much selection - there's almost too much to choose from! I really like the pastas.  Cheesecake here is also delicious, but I'm not sure if it's worth $7 per slice...

We always passed by I'd just start craving their food. Honestly I've only had their burgers and the Miso Salmon, but that's all the I need when I come here.  First of all, the host walked my friend and I to our table which was in a nice corner of the restaurant. It was a Friday afternoon so there wasn't that much people inside. Anyways, the restaurant has this nice atmosphere; not too bright and not too dark and the music wasn't loud and in the way. It was perfect background music to my friend and I's conversations.  After much consideration, we ordered our food. I think my friend thought I was rushing her, but that wasn't the case. Just interested in what she would decide on eating. So I got the Miso Salmon of course and my friend got the Pasta Da Vinci. While we waited we were given complimentary bread and we just talked until our food arrived which didn't seem to long.  The Miso Salmon is so good. I always loved the presentation with a single slab of salmon over rice covered in the sweet miso sauce. Sweet, but that salty fish taste is a great compliment to the overall dish. The salmon was easy take into with small bites and by the end I was as satisfied with the taste from the beginning to the last bite. The proportion was perfect, because it didn't leave me full and bloated, but full enough that I left satisfied.  The Pasta Da Vinci was pretty good as well. I had a small bite, but not enough to really divulge myself in its taste. Cheesecake factory is always a great place to go with a friend, or even a large group, or on dates.

Thankfully you don't have to have dinner here to enjoy the cheesecake. You can walk right up to the counter and order either a slice or full cake from their array of flavors.

Kevin Q.,"San Jose, CA",364,72,39,4.0,3/1/2012,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a multiple of times. Every visit was pretty decent. There is nothing bad about this place, but also nothing super amazing, except the cheesecakes of course! On the weekends this place is usually packed, but any other day it's pretty empty. The service here is decent, the atmosphere is great, and the food, well it can be a hit or miss sometimes. First I would just like to make a comment on the cost of the food, yes it is pretty pricey if you think about it. 16-20 dollars for pasta? But then again the portions are huge! The portions are slightly larger then BJ's if you have ever been there. A entree of pasta could easily feed two people(depending on the person you share with of course). Also the pasta here isn't too bad. At times the pasta can be full of flavor and at other times it could be bland. The dishes I had with my group was the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Pasta Da Vinci, and Steak Diane. To start off the meal of course we had fried calamari and artichoke dip. Let's just say, I had better fried calamari at many other places. The calamari here was a bit bland and sometimes a bit too soggy. The artichoke dip here is very decent. In my opinion it doesn't match up with Red Robins or Chili's artichoke dip as they have better chips and more flavor in the dip itself. The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta on the other hand was pretty good. It had a small kick to it with a lot of flavors, and also the portion was huge. My friend couldn't finish it, so we all had to help him finish. On the side note though, I had this entree multiple times, and it could be pretty bland sometimes with no taste, besides the taste of pepper. The Pasta Da Vinci on the other hand was amazing. It was my first time getting it. The sauce had a unique flavor of onions and mushrooms. The only way I can describe it is like eating pasta with the In N Out thousand island sauce.

Mikey T.,"Anaheim, CA",211,49,4,2.0,1/6/2012,"Last year, after finding out how unhealthy it is, I vowed never to eat at another Cheesecake Factory again. Yesterday, I broke that vow. Okay, seriously: I'm not the most health-conscious person, and a couple times a week I'll find myself eating out and indulging in a fat burger or some lobster or something, but Cheesecake Factory is downright deadly. I decided to look up the nutrition facts of their menu one day - BIG mistake. A good 2/3rds of the menu contains an ungodly amount of calories and saturated fat, more than any person should eat in one sitting. That said, I was with a friend and we were both extremely fatigued from a long day of shopping and walking, and we also both had CF gift cards, so we decided to settle. Our food, however, did not. Even as I'm sitting here on my bed, typing away on my laptop, a good 11 hours after eating, I still feel it sitting there in my stomach, slowly clogging my arteries. I feel fat just typing this review. And it's not only the healthiness (or lack thereof) of the food that left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended), it's also...well, the bad taste. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci; sounds refined, right? Not exactly. The pasta was undercooked, I only received a few skimpy pieces of dry chicken, and the entire dish was lathered with more sauce than it needed. It felt like I was eating a slightly-upscale version of a microwave dinner.  I will say this: the brown bread that they have is absolutely DELICIOUS. And it's not bad for your health, either...well, because it's just bread. As far as this particular location goes, there's ample seating (boothes, tables, high-chairs and a bar area) and the staff is courteous and highly attentive, checking in with us to make sure that we had everything that we needed. This was a pleasant surprise for me; being a young adult, I find that many times, servers do not pay as much attention to me as they do to older customers. Although I certainly don't need any extra attention, its always a nice gesture to receive some. Hey - just because I'm young doesn't mean I don't know how to give a tip when I feel that it is deserved (and I did tip, generously, in this case).  All ranting aside, if it weren't for the outstanding customer service, that scrumptious brown bread, and the good company that I was with, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this night as much as I did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=980

I went with a large group of around 14 friends for dinner at around 6:30 pm on a Friday night and we had to wait over an hour to get a table. They don't take reservations! Then we had to wait some more for our waiter to take our orders. After ordering, we waited about 40 minutes before our food finally came. Okay, maaaaybe the times are exaggerated a bit.

We ordered strawberry lemonade, calamari, veggie pasta, orange chicken and the banana cheesecake. Food, drinks and dessert were good. What was shockingly sad was the state of the women's bathroom.

They sat us near the bar area and we ordered the following Avocado Egg Rolls - Delicious just like last night Popcorn Shrimp - tender, crispy  Steak Diane, Chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes for hubby caramel chicken for myself with rice Desserts: Limoncello Torte with whipped cream Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake with whip for hubby Drinks: Arnold Palmers for the both of us. They did not deliver any bread to our table, so minus one half star. Nor did they ask if we wanted bread..... I did not like my caramel chicken at this Cheesecake Factory. The chicken was overly fried and too crispy for a rich dish such as this. I felt like it was tough chicken mcnuggets floating in a sauce. I took 1 star off for this dish. So hence the 3.5 stars.

Really though, I don't think taking a filet of salmon and throwing some teriyaki sauce on it is worth $16 bucks, but hey - they get away with it all the time. The sheer amount of calories per dish is insane. By the way, each slice of cheesecake is actually FOUR servings. You eat the whole thing, you're getting upwards of about 1300-1600 calories.

My mother wanted something with shrimp so we ordered her the Pasta Franchese and it was HORRIBLE. Something clearly went wrong in the cooking process. The breaded shrimp was delicious, but the pasta was incredibly salty. If you ate just one strand your mouth would blow up with saltiness. Unlike the description on the menu, there was only 2 or 3 pieces of artichoke hearts within the pasta. We asked the waitress to swap out of the pasta, and she did, and came back with a new batch which was still salty, and so we asked for Penne instead which was STILL disgustingly salty. My mother didnt end up eating any of her food which wasted a good 15 dollars. It wasn't the waitress's fault, she was very sweet and accommodating, but really? Why was the pasta so damn salty?

As soon as she started taking my friend's and my order, we immediately felt uncomfortable and rushed through our cheesecakes, when we just wanted to enjoy our cheesecakes and talk and just have a great time. And its not like we felt rushed because it was a dinner rush, there wasn't a waiting list when we got our table so really we shouldn't have felt rushed to begin with. All in all my friends and I had a bad experience. It's not like i wanted the server to cozie to our every need, but i should feel appreciated that i am providing the store with job security. We're at Valleyfair, sure we're youngsters, but you don't make our experience bad, especially when there are more hardworking employees at the food court who show better customer service in the 1 minute time frame you get when ordering, and they don't even get tips. I will not be going to this location EVER again, i can get my cheesecake from another location that will provide good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=760
Hang T.,"San Jose, CA",371,851,1993,2.0,2/17/2011,"I don't usually review chain restaurants, but I think this place deserves a review - probably because of all the bad service I've had here. The only thing I order on a regular basis is the firecracker salmon rolls and the strawberry shortcake. Those are the only two memorable things that come to my mind.  In terms of service, if you make a mistake or they make a mistake on your order, they will NOT take it off your bill! This has happened to me like three times even though it was sometimes the waiter's fault. The only thing they could do for me was basically take it off the tip, but that was it. Since so many people go to their restaurants, I don't think they really need to satisfy their customers into coming back.

Some of the tables can be a little close to others on busy days but if your willing to wait a booth is better. But once we sat close to another older couple who was celebrating their 36th anniversary and we ended up pushing our tables together and had a nice dinner with them, so sometimes it just works better in the end!  Tips: Come before 6pm, we usually do an early dinner at 5:30 and the wait if any is short, weekends of course are busy so lunch time is better, or around 8pm for a late dinner.  p.s.

As far as chain restaurants go, this one is great. They have tasty bread, fairly quick service (at this one), and great cheesecakes! I got a great shrimp angel hair dish and loved the crab bites and avocado eggrolls. For dessert (because you would be insane to not eat dessert here) we got a piece of Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake and the Reeses something something Cheesecake (it's a new flavor). Both were delicious. The Reeses sneakily has a layer with snickers in it, and the chocolate cake actually contains a layer of coconut cheesecake to break up that chocolatey goodness.

Waiting to be seated after being called (with other groups being called and seated before me), waiting to order a drink, waiting for that drink, and waiting for an appetizer. Dirty dishes were also a problem. Luckily, they started a shift change while I was eating. Everything changed for the better. Quicker response times, more attentiveness, etc. My second waitress was much better at her job than the hostesses or my original waiter. All that said, I did complain to the manager. He appeared to be very concerned with the issues I had and voluntarily gave me a significant discount on my meal. He did a great job of turning a bad experience into a more positive one.

Maybe late Sunday night is the rack?  Was told about 15mins was only like 5 to get seated for two.  Cool interior.   Drinks: Strawberry smoothie  $5.95 Icy, watery, not much flavor, skip. House (Berriger) white zin; $6.95 - you gotta be kiddin,  for a less than 1/2 filled glass?  skip... Apps: Fried Mac & cheese:  crispy outside, creamy inside.  not much zing, a little sweet, needed some pep.  creamy and fresh tomato sauce.  $8.95 for 4??  idk, 2 for $4.99 would have been better, and didn't like the slightly sweet cheesy flavor.  skip.  when they packed the lefties they didn't include any sauce...  Kids would love it tho, they's be happy with just this. Sweet corn Fritters:  very good.  hush puppy type breading, perfectly cooked corn.  $4.95 for six or so, good value for money.  Mustard sauce?  Not!  more like chipotle mayo.  still, good with the fritters.  Lefties were packaged w/o sauce...  :( entres: Pasta carbonara.  Superb!  Lots of bacon flavor. Diff server, but she  brought fresh basil when asked and offered fresh cheese.  $13.50.  Nice portion, but over priced.  You and me know how much we can make this for at home... Special:  fried shrimp platter $13.95. Great portion, lots of butterflyed crispy shrimp with fatastic tartar sauce (big hit of garlic) and light coctail sauce; needed a bit of zip, some hot sauce offered would have been nice.  Outstanding coleslaw and perfectly cooked frites, katsup was offered and accepted.  Minus!  Again, forgot to pack my coleslaw in the lefties...I know, I should have looked in the bag....sigh.   It was really good... Deserts: Apple caramel strusel.  Fantastic.   Banana cream:  another big hit; the whipped cream stood up for two whole days!  BF used to be a card-carrying cheesecake hater!  Dare I say we've witnessed a new birth? ...LOL Other pluses:  Ryan was pretty attentive and appologized when he was taking too long.   when Ryan boxed our lefties, he provided two fresh warm loaves of the breads for EACH of us wrapped in foil.  big plus there.  we didn't ask for that, we'd been happy just to take what we left on our table.  diff server brought fresh basil when asked and offered fresh cheese for the bf's pasta. Minus:  Someone else served our entre's and got the bf's wrong.  Though she said ""cabonara"" and we both pointed to the bf, we thought it was strange it had bowtie pasta.  Then we noticed the chicken.  BF specifically ordered no chic.  New lady server went to get the cheese, and when she came back bf pointed out the error.  She said something like, ""let me check"" something and disapeared.  The bf sneaked a few bites of the pasta.  Said it was WAAAAYYY undercooked...  Anyway, she comes back very appologetic and asks what he wants.  Well, he's DYING for some creamy pasta full of bacon!  So away goes the offending dish, and wham zam, the correct dish is in front of the bf.  I think he got served somebody else's dish...oh well, it happens... Attentive service at first got lax as the evening wore on, but hey, they got busy, and we weren't in a hurry.  Again, nice Ryan appolgized when he laxed.  Some fresh sauce in a small plastic container for the fritters and mac would have made a five star.  And they completely didn't box my leftie coleslaw, that I paid for.... :( Total for above w/o tax or gratuity:  $75.10 We thought the wine and pasta was over priced.  There's lots on the menu we want to try, but we will skip the high priced drinks and be more choosy about the apps and entree's, since we also felt the cabonara was overpriced for the portion, and if there's a next time, we will deff check our doggie boxes to make sure everything we paid for is in there.   we're going again, for sure",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=760

Vanilla Bean Cheesecake - This one wasn't very good to me.

Stand in the line and wait another 10m for someone to shout your name ( why can't the buzzer just ring when they are actually ready to seat you?). Then we are taken to our table, but we can't order because we have to wait for our server to come take the order, the lady that brings us to the table can't take any orders but water.  Once you order and can actually eat your food, you have someone come every 5m to ask if everything is ok, to ask if we are still working on this or can they clear the table, etc.  I appreciate that they want to make sure that everything is ok and want to provide good customer service, but the whole thing means that it is impossible to have a conversation because you are interrupted every 2 seconds. In addition, the whole thing feels really rushed, like they are trying to do everything as fast as possible. I went there to have a relaxing time and didn't.

Norma I.,"American Canyon, CA",294,132,280,4.0,3/29/2014,"I've been at this location a few times now. I am not a huge fan of big chain restaurants, but the Cheesecake Factory has always been a fan favorite amongst several of my friends. It is a great place for friends to meet up and the menu has enough variety to satisfy most everyone's taste.   Surprisingly, I have never had an unusually long wait at this location, like I have at so many of the other Cheesecake Factories. Our wait was approximately 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad on a Thursday night. I have had as long as a 2 hour wait when I went to the Marina Del Rey location on a weekend night. Uuugh! We sat down at a table across the floor from the bar. The old world charm of the decor and the sultry lighting adds to the charm of this place. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with describing items on the menu that some of us were unfamiliar with. She was also great at making suggestions on certain items. I ordered one of their signature combinations: Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane. It is a sauteed chicken breast with fresh asparagus & melted mozzarella cheese, topped with a mushroom Madeira Sauce. It is so tasty! It didn't sound at all that appealing on the menu, but I am so glad that it was suggested and I ordered it. The chicken was tender and the various flavors really made this dish a hit. I believe I found a new favorite! The Steak Diane are beef medallions covered with black peppercorns & a rich mushroom wine sauce, served with mashed potatoes. My meat was not cooked at all the way I asked! I told them I like my meat medium, more on the rare side, but no blood! I want it pink without blood oozing out! I was assured that they would make it the way I wanted, but that this would be considered medium cooked. It came to me tough and chewy. You would have thought I asked for it to be cooked well done. I hadn't plan to say anything because there was so much food on my plate that I knew I would not be able to eat it. Besides, I was enjoying my chicken. But one of my friends mentioned it to my waitress. She came over and I explained to her how the meat was. She took a look at it and agreed that it was over cooked. There was no pink in the meat at all. She went back to the kitchen and came back with another steak cooked exactly the way I had asked and my friend ate it because I was stuffed! He loved it! lol! My friends ordered a variety of cheesecakes to share, but I am not a huge fan of cheesecake. I had an ex- that had me on cheesecake overload and I have stayed away from it ever since! But OMG! The Strawberry Shortcake is so yummy! It is made on their own homemade biscuit, sprinkled with sugar and covered with fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream. I love it! I know most people come here to eat their incredibly tasting cheesecakes. There are so many to choose from. But I love the Strawberry Shortcake! All their dinner portions are huge. You can share a dish with a friend, but always save room for dessert. This is what you come here for! :) Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=780

Andrea S.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,,3.0,1/11/2015,"My husband and I came here for a date night and this is my review of our visit.  Firstly, I was disappointed that we could not make reservations, because it always seems to be packed. So we showed up and was very busy for a Thursday evening; loud and crowded. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  After a few minutes our server brought us our drinks and bread and returned a few minutes later to take our order. We asked him what he would recommend and at first it seemed like he was a little annoyed with the questions. More like ""I'm busy, just hurry and order"", but after a minute he decided to be more helpful. My husband ordered the garlic noodle dish and I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken.  Both dishes were decent, not horrible but definitely nothing spectacular. Wouldn't order either dish again.  I went with the intention of having a slice of cheesecake for dessert but ended up not getting a slice after all.  Not for any bad reason,  I was just full.

Places like Cheesecake Factory have mediocre if not tasteless tasting food at ridiculous prices with high fat and cholesterol content.  I don't want to pay $10+ for a stupid salad, burger, sandwich, or bland spaghetti plate I could make myself. However, what I do give Cheesecake Factory 5 stars for are their homemade CHEESECAKES! They are pretty pricey, around $7 I think for a slice, but they are HUGE slices.  I can't finish one slice in one sitting.  I believe they have 50% off cheesecakes during some time of the year.  I wouldn't come here to eat anything besides their outstanding cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=780

This time we chose to sit at the bar. Let me just say it was the best decision ever! I didn't get the bartender's name but he looked like the guy from the Skyfall 007 movie. Personable, charismatic and attentive would be the three words to describe him. We ordered the avocado egg rolls..best ones I've had so far. fresh avocado and the outside of the roll crisped to perfection. We often order the orange chicken dish split into two which is a great portion. The chicken was perfectly white inside, nice and crisp on the outside and the rice was delish!

The waitress was really nice and was quick/fast with everything like refilling water, asking if everything is ok, etc.  The small appetizers they offer now are really good. I always like the classic calamari and the steak diane combo they have here which is one of my favorites. They have some new chicken samosas that are good, so is the artichoke and crap dip too. They have a new special menu and we ordered a chicken-something, it came with basil noodles crusted chicken breast. a Little on the saltier side, but I liked it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1020

Steven C.,"San Francisco, CA",155,550,297,3.0,4/8/2008,"What is with the wait for this place? 30-45min ZOMG. Cheesecake Factory has a rep for being good, but not THAT good. There's not much seating in the waiting area either so after 20min of standing around packed body to body and staring at the back of the person's head in front of you, you'll more than likely start feeling emo. I sure as hell did. I'm not sure why my immediate family or all the other people standing around aimlessly waiting choose to endure the long wait times. Note to self: demand a change in restaurants for family reunion dinners. Food isn't great but it's not bad either, some dishes are hit or miss but overall it's standard fare and any choice should be pretty solid on their huge menu. There isn't really a list of recommendations for this place listed on Yelp so I'm going to go ahead and suggest ordering their Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic for pasta lovers. Works for me, not too bland but just be sure to mix the bottom of the plate with the bow tie pasta. Regarding their cheesecakes.. I like them, not the best but still pretty good. Waiter service could use some work here, perhaps understaffed since its' been pretty meh the last few times I went. On a random note, it may just be me but this particular cheesecake restaurant feels poorly lit with the lights being dimmer than what I recall from other stores. Maybe it's lit poorly to encourage food coma naps after eating their huge portions, shrug. This Cheesecake Factory would be a lot more enjoyable place to visit if they ever chose to expand. Something tells me even though I complain about the long wait times and mediocre service,  I'll still be coming here in the near future cause of family and once again, the cycle of whining goes on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1020

We placed our drink and appetizer order, took about 10 minutes to get a water and a soda, placed our entree orders which about 20 minutes later our appetizer came out (we had the nacho's) then about 7 minutes later our entree came out. To me 30 minutes for my appetizer is a long time and to bring out our food a few minutes later is just ridiculous. I barely ate my entree and when i went to place my dessert order the waitress didn't even ask if we wanted to order dessert or if we need/wanted anything else she handed my husband the bill before I could even ask for my dessert.

Herrick L.,"Fremont, CA",48,39,,3.0,6/2/2011,"Expect a long wait. The Cheesecake Factory is a popular restaurant, with a very appealing interior and a wide variety of signature cheesecakes and entrees. The serving sizes can be a bit too much, depending on what you order, so if you have a habit of always trying to clear your plate like I do, you will find it difficult to leave room for one of their delicious cheesecakes. Actually, even when I have to struggle to breathe from the amount of food I've eaten, I still make it a point to order a cheesecake. To me, they are just that good.  My favorite lunch option is the Margherita pizza, which uses fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil and is baked on a delicious flatbread crust. For dinner, I like the Steak Diane and Hibachi Steak. As for cheesecake, my favorite is definitely the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. The pros: - Food is usually good, cheesecakes are thick and delicious - Large dinner servings if you're hungry, but some might see this as a con.  - Spacious, classy interior, provides an excuse to dress up a little The cons: - Pretty expensive (cheesecakes $7+, entrees $15-$25+) - Always a long wait - For the cost, I was expecting the entrees to be tastier.  - Would like a smaller size option for dinner entrees Overall, I think I wouldn't come here much if it weren't for the cheesecakes. The cost and the driving distance are also an issue for me, since I live ~20 minutes away. It's worth trying though, if you don't mind waiting in line, taking home leftovers and paying a little extra, you will probably enjoy coming here more than I do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1020

I usually get their tropical smoothie which is perfect if you are craving something fruity and flavorful, Louisiana chicken pasta and tiramisu. I have tried a lot of their cheesecakes and so far my favorite flavors are the herseys chocolate, tiramisu, dulce de leche and the godiva (for the chocolate lovers!)

Carolen M.,"Milpitas, CA",2238,1238,10067,2.0,12/30/2007,"I remember while in college trying to get to talk to a manager for a software engineering project and they never got back to me.  For being a non-franchised restaurant, I would think they would be a little bit more friendly.  Anyways, my family and I went here for some appetizers and cheesecake because the appetizer's big enough for an entree and we were there primarily for the cheesecake.  The wait for tables can be as long as 2 hours.  We were lucky enough to get there early so our wait was 15-30 minutes...which ended up being 30 minutes.  So come here for an early dinner otherwise you'll have to wait staring at the cheesecakes in the display... I noticed that the cheesecake in the display outside had more options than what they had in the menu.  I tried ordering the Lemoncello cheesecake and our server kept wanting to give me the torte.  I ended up just getting a the white chocolate peanut butter cheesecake which was extremely rich.  I was also afraid of walking around the restaurant in fear of falling due to the ultra greasy floors.  The restrooms were completely atrocious.  There were two unwrapped toilet papers on the floor due to the fact that the rolls in the holders were empty.  I would have thought such a nice establishment would at least keep its restrooms clean. The Firecracker Salmon Rolls wasn't that spicy, but the sauce and cabbage was great garnish to eat.  The avocado roll was so full of avocados...I'm not a big avocado fan so if you like avocados go for this appetizer.  The dipping sauce was sweet and went perfectly with the roll. Overall, I only go here when my family goes since I would never go here on my own.  I really don't like cheesecake and would rather splurge on ice cream.  I also realized I do not like peanut butter in my desserts.  Just too salty and really puts an imbalance in my mouth.  Good to bring relatives I guess so that they can experience the glory that is cheesecake.  I'd rather drive to SF though or perhaps I should try the Stoneridge Mall's Cheesecake Factory.  It might be better than here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=840

Leslie H.,"Cupertino, CA",407,923,214,3.0,4/22/2012,"What should I expect? Well, an hour long wait for one thing. Actually, that's not too bad considering it was a Saturday evening, and we showed up around 6:15. I took a seat and settled in for some prime people watching. It seems like Cheesecake Factory appeals to all sorts of demographics. We saw ""Girls Night Out"" crews, families, prom goers, teenagers on group dates, pretty much everything. When you check in, the hostess gives you a pager and a time estimate, but don't stray too far because the pager only has a 30 foot range. I was told 45-50 minutes for the wait and given a pager with a detached capacitor. I wasn't fully convinced that it would buzz, so I just waited for my name to be called.  The Cheesecake Factory has a smart business model. Make people wait so they get hungry and then give them a massive menu with a huge number of choices. I'm not sure why a typical pasta dish costs upwards of $15, but their portion sizes sure are huge. I've really enjoyed their chicken Madeira and chicken Marsala as well as their various pasta dishes in the past, but I just can't bring myself to shell out so much anymore, so I usually go with their crispy chicken sandwich. It's a chicken breast that's battered and fried, then topped with a slice of cheese, a slice of cheese, one measly slice of tomato, and a bunch of shredded lettuce. You'd think a place like The Cheesecake Factory that would charge $12 for a sandwich could at least use whole pieces of lettuce, but no. It doesn't even come with onion or a pickle! But it's still one of the cheaper items on the menu. It also comes with fries. I used to really enjoy their shoestring fries, but they seemed to have switched to thicker cut ones. One thing I will give them is that their chipotle mayo and their ranch dressing are darn tasty. I did greatly enjoy our white chocolate blueberry cheesecake yesterday, but I did also balk at the $6.95 price tag. Oh well, you kind of get what you expect and are willing to pay for when you come to The Cheesecake Factory. Typically, I would say I won't be back, but this being the popular dining spot that it is, it's likely that I will return.

When we got my daughters order of chicken sliders, it should have been with fruit not fries, it took them 15 minutes to bring her some fruit that looked like it was cut up for a baby(pieces the size of the end of your pinky). Since it took so long to get our food I thought it was a good idea when our food came out to place my To Go order for my spouse at home, so the order would be out in time. We waited another hour for my to go order. When I asked about the 4 times, he said "" He was waiting for the order"", then "" He was looking for the order"", then "" They didn't bring it out"" and last "" Oh it was sitting up there waiting for you to tell me you are ready"". I proceeded to check my food, the chicken and mashed potatoes where cold. I told the server this and he said "" I can have it warmed up for you"", I told him I could do that at home.  When I asked for a manager it took her 15 minutes to get back to me. My family was waiting outside since she said she would be right back.  Needless to say the birthday dinner for horrible from the bad service to the cold food and all around horrible customer service.  I will never go there again!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=840
Lee K.,"San Jose, CA",0,36,3,4.0,10/6/2015,Cheesecake factory is consistent in their food throughout the chain.  I have been pleased with the quality of food and service that has been provided by this location.

We had stopped by on a Sunday night, and we easily grabbed a table by the bar. Our waitress came by to take our order as soon as we sat down. Thank G!d for the few good waitresses out there. Our's was amazing. She was patient while I searched through my messy bag for my I.D., and she always always always remembered our orders even when we kept getting excited and forgetting. I wish I had stopped chattering and remembered her name! I will be sure to get it when I return! We had decided to order a couple of tiny appetizers. We wanted to fill up a little bit since none of us ate lunch, but we didn't want to have to unbutton as soon as we were in the car and no one was looking. As you can imagine, we were delighted to see that there was a 'small plates and snacks' menu. :) To eat, we ordered: - Greek Salad (standard) - Tex Mex Eggrolls (not really my thing, but always a hit with friends) - Shrimp Scampi Crostini (sooo yummy, but sooo small) To drink, we ordered: - Lemon Drop Martini (idk how, but it got my friend super tipsy...FAST) - Typhoon Punch ( tasty and does its job well) - Factory Peach Bellini (fun and tasty, but not hard) We followed with:  - White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake (i died) I ordered to-go: - Red Velvet Cheesecake (my hot little love interest completely devoured it before I could even get to it) Great food, great drinks, great service...

Came here yesterday with my family of 5 as a pre surprise for my 40th birthday.  After a long day of work and  a beautiful day in the sun and school for my children. My wife dicided to surprise me and my 3 daughters for a night to unwind and dinner free household. there wasn't a wait we were so lucky we were led to a table. What was weird was as we were walking pass 3 available table that I  thought could hold 5 ppl we were led to the back near the restroom? As we came close my wife was maybe a mind reader she also was thinking what i was thinking and decided to voice her opinion so we were re-directed back to the front. Right here I already had a strike on the service and basically played along with the night. Little that they know I'm a critic and a very voiceful  individual when service are not perform to the satisfaction.    When we were seated, I found our waitress wasn't  friendly at all from the beginning. No smile, no welcoming and compassionate vibe was coming out of her personality. As I glanced across the section where we were sitting i seen a friendlier waiter doing his job with another guest properly. so I said oh my!  So to make a long story short we got our food. We didn't get any comments how was our food nor are water glass and refreshment wasn't being service when they were empty. Oh get this I hated to seeing waiters and waitress watching me eat as they stand right across of me waiting for guest or they just didn't have anything to do. So honestly this visit was a total waste of time and effort and I really don't understand why big chain restaurants are beginning to fail in there customer satisfaction report card? Don't they know we as the customer is the bread and butter of the restaurants flourish to shine?

Jackie S.,"Milpitas, CA",416,1463,2091,2.0,8/19/2010,"My department decided to have Cheesecake Factory cater a lunch event. I decided to pick up the food with another co-worker since CF does not have delivery and the food is cheaper. They go through a third party vendor,  , to deliver the food.   is a rip off as each dish is a couple dollars more, and there is a 15% drivers fee (excluding the delivery fee). Since our food was over $1400, the driver's fee could have been easily $200. Anyway, I called the restaurant on Friday morning for pick up on Monday at 11:30am. The event started at 12:15pm, so there was plenty of time. When we arrived at 11:30am, the food was not ready. We waited 30 minutes for the food to be brought out. Yeah ... at 12pm!!! The restaurant should have done that at 11am and not at 11:30am when it was the pick up time. The lady who had the receipt made sure that all the food was brought out and she didn't even apologize for bringing out the food. By the time we got back to the office, it was well past 12:15pm, and we had to set up the food. How unprofessional. I would NOT recommend having you pick up your catering food at Cheesecake Factory. It is not worth the hassle. At the end of the day, I guess   was worth the additional money and lack of stress.

I think you cannot go wrong with any of their cheesecakes, although my personal favorites are the Red Velvet, Godiva Chocolate and Strawberry cheesecakes. The others are either just too sweet or too complicated for my tongue to comprehend. They've just added the ""skinny menu"" recently and I think that really takes away the point of going to the Cheesecake Factory. The dishes don't look or sound very attractive.

Rei P.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,6,3.0,11/13/2012,"I loved Cheesecake Factory. The first time I came here I was in awe of all the food choices and just couldn't get enough of coming back. My sisters and I made this our go to restaurant. That is why I am incredibly sad to say that this is probably no longer the case. I understand that prices have to go up, and I don't mind that if the portion size stays the same. Unfortunately, Cheesecake Factory has raised their prices and made their portions a lot smaller than what I remember. My favorite dishes were the shepherds pie and the lemon herb roasted chicken, and I would alternate between getting these all the time. The shepherds pie used to be covered with potatoes completely so that I couldn't see the beef underneath, but it seems the potatoes on top just keep getting smaller and the price has risen $2-$3. The same goes with the lemon herb roasted chicken's price. The chicken pieces they gave used to be huge and the sauce was so flavorful, but the past few times I've ordered it, the chicken was small and the sauce too watery or none at all. I still love their cheesecakes though. Most of the time the servers are good enough, but when I went with my sister on Sunday it seemed that our waitresses(there were 2) forgot about us and another person actually noticed us just sitting there and offered to pack our food for us.  I'm really sad to say that I won't be coming here as often anymore, but it will help me save money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=900
Warren W.,"Burlingame, CA",412,233,85,5.0,7/20/2009,"As a former Cheesecake Factory employee and frequent patron, I just had to drop a line, especially with the insider info yo. #1 - your experience is at the utter mercy of your server 100%. It makes or breaks everything. For that reason, I'll wait 2 hours for a hella bomb server that I know and have worked with. In case you're not so patient (haha), you can grab seats at the bar. The bartenders are hella cool, chances are you'll see Sam or Jeff or this other pinay hottie whose name escapes me right now lol.  You also grab the high top tables beside the bar area. Those are totally up for grabs. A complete free-for-all so during busy nights, you can just hover around there and wait for a free table. Skip the entire line that way. ;) But yea man, like the Cheesecake Factory is one of the best places to go, definitely one of the highest bang for buck places for sure. I DARE YOU NOT TO HAVE LEFT-OVERS lol. ALmost impossible.  Try: -Miso Salmon -Bang bang chicken & shrimp -Chicken Marsala -Da Vinci Pasta -Laua Salad Like your drinks?? dude: -ultimate margarita (prepare yourself) -georgia peach (great girly drink lol) -MOJITOS! (dang, love that mint. they make it hella bomb too) -Arnold Palmers, love that sugar rim on the glass.  Appetizers!!!! --- my fav part -AVOCADO EGG ROLLS (i swear by these) -SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES  I love those two appetizers TO DEATH.  If you don't like them... shoot..... I'll buy you a slice of cheesecake or something lol.  Cheesecake! Ahahaaa... (use to work in the bakery mwahaha) -GOdiva. 4 kinds of chocolate. dense as hell. more calories, sugar, carb than a big mac =D -Chocolate Tuxedo. it is THE coolest looking cheesecake. mix of dark and white chocolates, insanely cool decor on the plate, trust me -White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle - one of the bestsellers for a reason -REgular Cheesecake/ REg + strawberry - the classic -Turtle Pecan - my personal favorite, very rich rich, creamy =) -Vanilla Bean - a twist on the vanilla flavor with the richness that ice cream has never captured, you will be very pleasantly surprised THere's almost 50 slices and I've tried them all. They're all good.  If you got a big appetite and you're ambitious as hell.... try the dessert of the gods: Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake. [you will die.] Craig's Carrot Cake is hella insane too.  AND of course,  your meal always comes with bread at the beginning.  FYI, that brown bread is not chocolate bread lol It's wheat baguette, hella bomb. =) You can ask for as much as you want! Hey, enjoy your meal =D If you're there on weekday nights/weekend nights and you want the best server in the house, ask to sit in Marcel's section. Tell him Warren sent ya. ;) He'll take care of you yo.  Just celebrated my 6 month anniversary with my girl and this guy made our dinner absolutely... indescrible.

Robert K.,"San Jose, CA",141,437,196,3.0,8/24/2009,"Yet another semi mediocre review for Cheesecake Factory. Unlike other businesses, this place survives not on repeat business but on the fact that they have an amazing location, great decor, are open late, are HUGE, and have a huge menu.   That being said I always find myself going here despite the fact that the food isn't really all that great.  Their 20 page menu has so much to choose from and I've had quite a few dishes there and it seems to get worse and worse.  It's just really a bad attempt at fusion and it mostly comes out Americanized, no matter what the dish, and it seems like it's all microwaved and thrown together.  Not good. The bar is nice though and yes the deserts are pretty good, too.   The new red velvet cheesecake is the best desert I've ever had, period.  It's 1550 or so calories too, FYI! I'd also like to point out that a manager told me that this particular cheesecake will be around for a while because ""it'd be a bad business decision to get rid of it since it's so popular.""  So, not because it's great, but because they're making money off it.  Haha.  And then he said ""it has too much frosting for me personally""     I LOVE that he said that, it's nice to get honesty out of someone who works in the restaurant industry.  It's very rare, trust me.. Oh and another funny note is that they offer no entertainment for kids.  We once asked for a piece of paper for our daughter to draw on and they just gave me a stub of receipt paper.  I thought that was funny and I actually like the idea of shunning children and making it not kid friendly, haha",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=900

I like to go to mom n pop style places or dives, diners and such or food trucks and stalls but this is one of my bf's favorite restaurant so I came here. What we had: Chicken madiera- This was good, I liked it but the taste didn't really surprise me it just wasn't very unique, the madiera sauce somehow tasted a little bit like hoisin. It was good nevertheless so this is definitely a must try. Pina colada- it came out too icy and lacked flavor, i like the pina colada at elephant bar better and even that pina colada i had at dave and busters dulce de leche cheesecake- it was at least not too sweet cause some of the cheesecakes here are too sweet and it was good it's just that I know the difference with the taste of home made cheesecake than massively produced cheesecakes. The best cheesecake I've had was at broken record and the white christmass cheesecake dome at cheesecake etc in the philippines OMG that was amazing. Calamari- Good and the squid was fresh but our calamari was lukewarm as if it had been fried beforehand. The best calamari I've had is still in pier 39 in embarcadero. Moving on, my bf had the chicken bowtie pasta thing I forgot what it was called, it looked good and tasted alright. Here's what I think: 1.They have this strategy of making people wait, there were a lot of empty seats and I'm not very sure if it's because they have a special ritual before they seat you but my gut tells me it's a marketing strategy to make people think they are always packed and of course to make you hungry. 2.I actually feel sorry for the utensils here, they are basically mutilated, there are scratches here and there and you can see the dried up water on the spoons and fork. I think everything accounts to appetite, how you eat in your house is also your attitude when you eat out. I take food seriously and cleanliness too nothing just makes you wanna eat more than nice clean utensils. 3. There's definitely something about the portion sizes, I would expect to have big servings like most places like these offer but the are kinda lacking in that area. Conclusion: Would I come back? Yes, not soon but yes. This place is alright.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=900

I tasted the pasta and it was still cold and there was chunks of cheese everywhere in the dish. So I sent it back for them to reheat my dish. When they brought back my dish it looked like they gave me a brand new plate of pasta. They didn't take out the ricotta and it looked like they only gave me half of my portion. Weird because I only took a bite of my dish before I sent it back. There was more cheese than pasta. When I tasted it, the pasta was still cold to warm. Ehh it was whatever to much.

I usually don't get the pasta, but I'm sure that's not whats supposed to be in it.   We immediately informed the waiter and the manager personally came out to apologize, comp my meal, and gave me a house salad on the house (although I wish she gave me cheesecake!).  I was impressed with the manager coming out to take care of everything herself.   Generally, I think Cheesecake is overrated, but after this incident I have mixed feelings about specifically eating at the one in vf.  I liked the professionalism and treatment I got when we reported the hair, but in a nice place like Cheesecake, there really shouldn't be one in the first place.   On a happier note, the food tastes good.  I like getting the miso salmon and replacing the rice with mashed potatoes.  By far, the BEST dessert is the RED VELVET cheesecake!  Red velvet + cheesecake= :D  It was GENIUS to combine the two.  Absolutely scrumptious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=900

Haha..our meal today was: 0: my pomegranate margarita blended- it was a good kick of tequila - tiny bit on the salty side but I still sipped it all - numbering 0 because it wasn't food - hehe :P 1: Fried calamari - hubby was craving this one today and although wr've had better, it satisfied his craving 2: Spinach and Artichoke dip with chips - it's just the right amount of cheese and goo served warm dipped with a tortilla chip is a must have for me! Loved it! 3: sweet corn tamale with toppings on the side - for me little bubba, toppings consists of salsa, sour cream and avocado chunks - he doesn't care for the sour cream and salsa but loved the avocado chunks with his sweet corn tamales! 4: small plates fried artichoke hearts - it was perfect! Delicious crunchy on the outside and healthy on the inside! Yummy goodness! 5: Classic fresh strawberry cheesecake to share - it really doesn't get better than that! Food Service was on point today, the wait was bad but not brutal for a 6:15 on a Saturday night - quote was 10-15 but we waited 25-30 mins for a table.

There was a small line huddled around the dessert counter, which was a brightly lit display fridge housing an array of delectable cheesecakes to choose from. Decisions, decisions...Some of the cakes were even cut open so you could see the tempting layers on the inside, which was how the Red Velvet lured us in.  The wait was no more than a few minutes, as two staff members took orders while a third packed up slices to go. When we got home, we broke open the box and delved into the delicious wedge of Heaven. The cake was tiered, alternating between creamy white cheesecake and spongey red velvet cake. When we reached what would have been the crust if I were describing a pie, we got a mouthful of crisp, white chocolate shavings pressed into the frosting.  We washed each bite down with hot gulps of coffee.

From the gorgeous cheesecakes to the lip-smacking main course, this is a great place to dine for all occasions.  You will need a bit of patience as the wait time could be around 45 minutes just to be seated. It is worth the wait if you ask me because I simply love the food here.The serving portion is big enough for leftovers. The menu is impeccable. With a wide assortment to choose from and most of the choices excellent, my favorites include the chicken samosas, hot spinach and cheese dip and factory nachos for appetizers that are all must try items for anybody. Also love the club sandwich which is a good portion.  There is an varied list of delicious pastas and the best I've had are fettuccine Alfredo and shrimp with angel hair.  Also try their seafood options of shrimp scampi and the finest of all is the Jamaican black pepper shrimp served with rice, black beans and fried plantains along with spicy black pepper shrimp and a mango salsa. I also like the tropical smoothie to go with this and don't forget the cheesecakes for desert.  Dig into the ultimate red velvet cheesecake or tiramisu or take some home for later if you are stuffed.

There were at least 4-5 other groups there that checked in very closely to us with groups of 5 people or less and one other group that had a party of 10 people.

Finally after waiting for an hour and a half, we complained and the manager, Marsha came out and said it was their fault that they got our name mixed up with some other party's and that now we were going to have to wait additional time for another large table to open!

I ended up with enough pasta to feed a family of four in a very greasy sauce that tasted of hickory smoke flavoring.  And that's pretty much all it tasted of.  The flavors of the chicken and green peas that were included in the dish were overpowered.  The Key Lime Cheesecake that I ordered for dessert tasted, and had the consistency of, Key Lime Pie.  If there was any cream cheese used I'd be surprised. The teenagers enjoyed their food (Mini Hot Dogs and Four Cheese Pasta) but then they also eat things like Sour Gummy Worms.

There was a 15 minute wait, so I watched the dozens of people come and go after picking up a slice of cake. Mm...cake.  When we were seated, I found our waiter pretty entertaining and friendly. I glanced at the nutritional facts in that giant booklet of theirs, and I was kind of horrified how many of their meals were almost over the daily intake of calories. Gahhh.. totally put me off... I mean....how is that possible? It took us awhile to figure out what we wanted, because the menu is like a hundred billion pages, but its nice when you can't figure out what you really feel like. I ended up just getting a fettucini alfredo, and my boyfriend got the cashew chicken meal.  The fettucini was nothing to write home about, but then again I didn't expect it to be... I just had a craving for some creamy pasta. I really liked the flavoring of the cashew chicken, but the chicken was a tad overcooked and hard.  The portions are GINORMOUS (hence why the calorie intake is so large). I really think they should consider making their portions smaller... what a waste of food.

I've been to many locations and this seems to be the best and most consistent wit their food, as well as their servers. Either that or I just come here often enough that I end up getting the same servers time and time again.  Here's a review of dishes I've had here: Avacado eggroll: Best avacado eggroll I've had. I was always hesitant to try it because the dipping sauce looks rather intimidating. For someone who is not a fan of ""greens"", it looked a little bit like pesto. Of course it tastes nothing like pesto, but rather a really sweet candied flavor. Compliments the avacado eggroll perfectly.  Caesar salad/factory chopped salad: Very generous portions. I always get the appetizer portion and don't even finish. One thing I love about their salads, it always tastes incredibly fresh. Only part that doesn't always seem fresh are the occasional stale croutons.  Miso Salmon: I know everyone generally raves about this dish, and rightfully so! Whatever they put in that miso sauce is amazing. It's so subtle and doesn't overpower the salmon at all.  Chicken Maderia: Chicken and mashed potatoes, can't go wrong with that. If I'm hungry enough this is usually my go to dish.  Crispy spicy beef: I've only had this dish once. It's one of those dishes you can only have in small portions. By the 5th piece of beef, it can be somewhat overwhelming.  Cheesecake, dulce de leche, ALWAYS. Their whipped cream is freshly made, which makes the topping that much better.

If I want something ""healthy"" I'd get the Evelyn's favorite pasta. Their farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic is also very good. Their portions are generous so you do pay for what you get. Also, you can never go wrong with the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, but I would suggest not to force yourself to finish it all since the spiciness can get to you if you are a weak spice eater like me. :P  I have also gotten their crispy artichoke hearts under their small plates selections, it was just okay. Their vietnamese tacos were surprisingly delicious. Their buffalo wings with lots of blue cheese are really good because they are crispy and the meat is very soft. Their fried mac n cheese come in 4 balls, they're fried so of course, they are not good for your cholesterol levels. One bite into them, the creamy mac and cheese just melts in your mouth. Eating 2 balls is plenty because it does get filling.  Lastly, you can't forget their cheesecake. The ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake is OMG good!

Two of us got the Factory Burrito Grande without chicken, and the other two got pastas (four-cheese & pasta w/ marinara sauce). We were all incredibly satisfied by the portions and quality of food. What was equally impressive was our waiter, Eric E. We told him we were vegetarian and he later came back to ask if we can take chicken broth. Apparently it's in some sauce in the burrito, and he noticed it and came to ask! The food took a little bit longer to prepare because of the burrito modification, but he and the manager apologized to us several times. We were all incredibly awed by his sensitivity to our dietary needs and even told his manager as much. I've rarely ever had such a thoughtful waiter!  My reason for knocking off one star has to do with the price of the cheesecake. I used to frequently visit The Cheesecake Factory in Batimore, MD, and I remember the cheesecake slices being reasonably-priced, NOTHING like the $6.75-$7.75+ at the Valley Fair location. Ridiculous! $7 for ONE SLICE?   Otherwise I would recommend this place, but come early because it gets really crowded after a while!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1240

The pizza tasted excellent. Then it came down to the avocado eggrolls, it was kinda bland with an egg roll shell. I am accustomed to egg rolls with meat so eating this was bleh.  Honestly, I came here for their 30th anniversary 1.50 cheesecake. I wanted the tres leche but the ran out at 3pm. So I went for the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and that was yummy!  If they had this for a buck fifty on a daily, I'd become a diabetic within a year.  I'd give it 5 stars for their cheesecake but 3.5 stars for their food so that's why i'd give it a 4 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1240

Chester Y.,"Berkeley, CA",22,12,17,2.0,8/21/2006,"This place looks like they took their design cues from the general look of Tuscan villas then mixed in the vomit of a Cirque du Soleil art director. It's difficult to describe and nobody at the table could figure out what the motif was. Were I to title the aesthetic, I would call it ""Ghetto Bellagio"".  More tackyness came via the laminate-flipbook menus: every couple of pages is an advertisement for one of the businesses in the mall. And it doesn't need further cluttering. One could see that their corporate executive chef wondered to himself, ""should we go with Cal-Ital, Asian fusion, American coffee shop, dessert bakery, or Tex-Mex? Well I'll be damned if you limit me to a menu with any sense of coherency! I can do it all!""  Anyway...  I rather liked my salad. Baby lettuce with a fruity vinaigrette that was maybe a little bit too liberally applied, but well within the boundaries of judiciousness. My parents had an endive-based salad with blue cheese and other interesting leafies.   We all shared the ""Fresh Artichoke Fire-Roasted with a Spicy Vinaigrette"" and the ""Fresh Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Eggroll"" appetizers. The artichoke was quite nice, well-roasted and seasoned, but the avocado eggroll was precisely the disaster you would expect. Cut on the bias, they seemed like floppy spearheads as the eggroll skin was so non-crunchy that it was almost chewy. Normally I wouldn't order something quite so preposterous, but a paternal directive had been handed down, dictating that ""green"" appetizers be chosen. Plus, I was pretty curious as to what an avocado eggroll would taste like.  Anyway, by that point, we'd been reminded of one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Cheesecake Factory: portions so large they are of comical, Dagwoodsian proportions.  The avocado eggroll monstrosity could have been an entree --- and I guess it would be, if anyone were demented enough to eat avocado eggrolls as their main course.  By that point, I don't think a single one of us was actually hungry any longer. I was busy trying to steal water from my father's glass to dilute my strawberry lemonade (which had a syrup/water ratio akin to that of molasses) when our waiter brought out our entrees. For a moment, I forgot whether we were having dinner or staging an eating contest.  I had the ""Honey-Maple Pork Tenderloin,"" which came as a sliced log of pork arrayed on top of three full-sized ice-cream-scoops of dense mashed potatoes. This was flanked by a pound of steamed, diced carrots, and about two pounds of steamed broccoli. My father, a great proponent of prominent vegetable content, almost shat himself in envy when he saw my plate, because his ""Farfalle with Chicken and Mushrooms,"" which was a creamy sea of off-whiteness, nary a fleck of green in sight.  The Moms had the ""Herb Encrusted Filet of Salmon,"" which were two salmon filets leaned up against a scale replica of the Matterhorn, fashioned out of mashed potatoes. M.'s ""Grilled Pork Chops,"" had a similarly-geological mashed potato sierra. At this point, the overarching culinary philosophy of Cheesecake Factory had been illustrated for us: bountiful amounts of mass quantities.  As would be expected, the quantity had an inverse relationship with quality. My pork tenderloin was dry and bland and the sauce's only utility lay in pooling around the broccoli as glaze of cloying slime. The mashed potatoes were too dense and devoid of flavor. The steamed broccoli and carrots were, well, steamed broccoli and carrots --- except for the broccoli, which had been Ghostbustered by the aforementioned syrupy effluvium.  I traded for some of my veggies for some of my dad's pasta. The farfalle was alright, and copious, but the chicken tasted more or less like the steamed vegetables, only with a chicken breast texture. When my mother and I remarked on this, my father said, ""What do you expect? Chicken is chicken.""   Correspondingly, pork is pork. M.'s pork chops tasted like the chicken, only with a pork chop texture. Given that, I didn't feel the need to try any of my brother's chicken marsala, and was downright scared of trying my mother's filet of salmon. I was afraid the salmon would taste like chicken, only with salmon texture. Had that been the case, frankly, it would have freaked me out.  The good thing was that our tiramisu cheesecake tasted like tiramisu cheesecake, and not like chicken with a cheesecake texture. Actually, in all seriousness, it was pretty damn good. But, by then, it wasn't feasible to eat much of anything else.   And that's the story at Cheesecake Factory: everyone brings home a bunch of food in leftover boxes, packaged nicely enough that one almost wants to eat the same shitty food the next day.  [Note: This was a write-up from a visit four years ago.

Supposedly this is their ""most popular cheesecake"" I thought the frosting was overwhelming. I will probably stick to my old plain favorite the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1040

ChiYan T.,"San Francisco, CA",127,180,197,4.0,2/28/2010,"Yea, I know, it's a chain. I avoid the SF Union Square location like the plague. The wait times here are horrendous during peak hours. Everyone hates how the range of those electric light-em-up buzzers don't last to the Macy's next door, much less the mall indoors. Service is inconsistent due to the huge crowds and multiple large parties. So why the four stars?  IT CLOSES AT 12:30AM ON A SATURDAY. You know, when Straits, and everywhere else under the sun stopped at 11PM and the only other food in the entire San Jose/Cupertino/Santa Clara border would be either crappy pho, Dennys, Carrows, or the Jack-in-the-Box down the street.  See! Starting to sound appetizing? Sacrilegious as that statement may be?  Hungry after a little barhopping at Santana Row, it's conveniently right across Stevens Creek Blvd at the Valley Fair mall. Coming in this late there's no line and the place was pretty relaxed and lowkey. They do stop taking orders around midnight but they didn't rush us to leave after our plates arrived. We were able to recoup in a comfortable booth sipping some Tumi tea, with the hot water in out pots promptly refreshed from our friendly and courteous waiter.  The appetizers here are pretty good, from the gooey oh so delicious melt-in-your-mouth ""Avocado Eggrolls"", to the ""Salmon Spring Rolls"" served atop a bed of shredded red cabbage and topped with a gingery soy sauce so yummy, I had at one time contacted the franchise corporate office asking if I could buy a bottle (they were kind in their reply but wouldn't give it). I usually eat this whole thing like a salad. And of course, their cheesecakes are sinfully delicious. I've never caught onto their main courses, pastas, or salads here. And the nutritional guide can be jawdropping. Some of the things you'd think were healthier, like stuffed dates, have double the calories of the onion rings. Kid's portion pasta alfredo has 1800+ calories. That's a scary thing to feed a child.  But overall, compared to the limited options in the nearby area, this is was a great and relaxing way to wind down a boozy night in the local area.  Note: Oh, and be careful. 4-inch heels with no tread are going to slip all over the polished tiled floors here.

James D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",156,587,259,1.0,5/3/2010,"Although I find this place very sub par I do not know how I always find myself dining here! I guess because it's of other people's choice, but damn what a headache to come here, especially on the weekends. First off they don't take reservations so don't bother trying to have a birthday dinner here with large parties, you're just going to give yourself gray hair. So when I headed to the front to let the hostess know dinner for 7 (which isn't A LOT of people) she gave me a pager and said, ""for your large party, you're going to have to wait for a manager, and he'll give you a quote on how long your wait is"". Okay?! I have to wait for someone to tell me how long the wait really is, cool. While we waited, we just sat there in the lobby taking in ambiance and watching other people wait still thinking wow, why don't they take reservations. Total wait time was about a half hour which was acceptable (mind you I've waited an hour plus before) had we'd been told but while waiting absolutely no manager came out to ""greet us and tell us when our table was ready"" Anyways we were seated in a booth fitting 6 so my girlfriend's dad had to sit on a wicker chair at the head of the table. For $150 not including tip; our party got 7 entrees, 1 appetizer, 3 drinks, a free birthday cake the size of a baby's fist that didn't include cheesecake, inattentive service unless they overheard us, creepy manager guy looking over the wall that surrounded us, a birthday song for my girlfriend's little sister, and hella to go boxes. Considering I was the only one to finish my food, I wondered if my girlfriend's family even liked theirs. I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic which was yummy as always, but what brings me to give this place 1 star so easily is the freaking service. Do these people get underpaid? Or maybe they just don't care? I thought one of the things we were so suppose to learn from the recession was that no job is safe and that everyone should work harder for what they currently possess. I'm sorry Cheesecake Factory but there is absolutely nothing that entices me to venture back, not even the oh so decadent cheesecakes, Farfalle Pasta and Fried Macaroni and Cheese.

Wayne Q.,"Berkeley, CA",58,410,230,4.0,8/1/2010,"I have always loved Cheesecake Factory since its humble beginnings in the '80s.  This particular location, maybe during these tough times, doesn't seem to have much of a wait for lunch.  On a recent visit, I ordered a chicken-pasta something or other that just did not taste right at all.  Since we were in a bit of a rush, I didn't really complain and tried to eat it.  The chicken was just too hard and dry.  When the waitress returned to collect plates, she took a look at my plate and asked whether everything was OK.  I then told her about the chicken, and she immediately went and told her manager.  She came back, and I guess had even taken a bite herself and was in agreement that it was not up to par at all.  They ended up comping us a free slice of cheesecake, which was a very nice gesture. Sure-fire dishes every time are the Spicy Cashew Chicken and the Avocado Egg Rolls.  You may need to request bread, which I also think is really good.

Kimmy N.,"San Jose, CA",135,87,19,2.0,1/31/2010,"First Impressions:  This might be bias, but I hate Cheescake Factory.  No hunger deserves to wait 2 hrs for mediocre food.  Parking at Valley Fair is horrible generally.  I really think people live there, they go shopping, they eat, shop some more, go get a massage at the stands, and then a hair cut, shop and eat again.  Really packed parking lot everyday and almost every hour of everyday. Decor:  It looks like Cheesecake factory.  If you are confuse, please click on this image link here:  Service:  From beginning to end, you get a pager at the front, 45 minutes later they tell you wait to the left, 10 minutes later a host/hostess seats you and makes small talk, 10 minutes later your server comes.  At this time I am ready for some bread because I am so hungry and know what I am going to order.  The server comes and tell you the special for the deal and tries to confuse you. (Not a bad thing), but I wish I would know about the special before I made up my mind an hour ago while waiting.  In general the server was catering, here and there all the time.  Taste:  Bleeehhh.  After reading the novel, you better watch out.  I have hit a few grenades eating at this and other cheesecakes.  When I mean grenades, I mean horrible food!  There are some that are decent.  The Louisiana pasta is ok. Specialty:  This might be really obvious, the cheesecake. Price: $25/person (with dessert) Recommendations:   I love their seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecake (not very fond of the Pumpkin Pecan).  I also like the dulce leche, Godiva, oh what the heck, I love them all.  I would Cheesecake give it 2.75 stars if you didn't have to wait for an hour, no novel menu, and not so many grenades on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1040

It reminds me of my hometown where it is fairly common to wait atleast 45 minutes for a table. My first visit to Cheesecake factory included a 2 hour wait for a table. Yes, 2 hours. Well they actually gave us a tiny table in an hour and 45 mins but we opted to wait another 15 mins for a booth to open up. Service at the reception is really terrible...it should be on a first come first serve basis and not on the number of people in the party. We were just 2 and a lot of big groups were getting seated before us even though they came in after. Onto the food. Yummy bread basket, friendly server, good food, average portion size (thought the richness of the food fills you up). We ordered the avocado spring rolls (simply yumilicious), crispy artichoke hearts and the roasted vegetable and goat cheese pizza between 2 of us. I really enjoyed the pizza - it had the perfect combination of veggies, cheese and the slightly sweetish crust. This was one of the better tasting pizzas I have had so far in California. This was a drink free dinner as my husband and i are both trying to cut down on empty calories and our bill for the food came to about $33.

Butterfly A.,"San Jose, CA",582,791,410,4.0,1/14/2010,"Today was our anniversary and we were going to go to Reno or Vegas to celebrate but didn't since our cat is very sick now and still in the hospital. I didn't want to go at first but was glad that I did. We shared the avocado egg rolls which are delicious. The cilantro sauce that comes with it is really good too. I also like their fresh sourdough bread and butter. It was soo good that I ate maybe five pieces and three pats of butter. I blew my diet for tonight, but oh well! I haven't had anything this yummy in over a week. Plus, if I don't cheat once in awhile, I'd go insane if I deprive myself of bad carbs too much, lol.  I also got a pina colada and it was pretty good too. My husband got a large bowl of the Mexican tortilla soup. I was sorry that I didn't get that as it looked good. For the entree, I got something I haven't gotten in a long time, the Cajun Jambalaya dish. It comes with chicken and shrimp and is served over pasta. If you'd rather have it served with rice though, you have to tell your server that. I failed to do that today and when I got my dish, I was like, crap! I didn't want to bother the waitress so just ate it anyways. The pasta was OK, but it was a little undercooked. The portion is huge so I ended up taking most of it home.  I didn't eat much of the pasta, so maybe the scale won't reflect that tomorrow. I also ordered the Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake to go. I'm not sure if that's the right name for it, but it's really good! I just might have a few bites later as today is a day to celebrate! I'll be good tomorrow and maybe take a long overdue trip to the mall to get myself something cute to cheer me up and to walk off those extra pounds.  I almost forgot to mention that it tends to be so loud in there, that my husband got away with letting out a huge loud five second fart and bragged about it in the car. I didn't hear it but cracked up when he said it was a juicy one, LOL!

Isaiah N.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",46,359,22,4.0,12/11/2008,"For all the complaints and low ratings that I've seen for this particular  Cheesecake Factory, I have to admit that my experience at this location was great. My party of 3 was seated promptly (maybe we came at the right time, mid-afternoon, on a weekend if you can believe that!) and the service didn't feel fake at all.  The Cheesecake Factory has a LOT of items to choose from their long menu. I even found it surprising that they place ads ON their menu! What's up with that? But whatever you choose here (I got the chicken madiera and non-cheesecake tiramisu), be prepared to either share your meal or ask for ""doggie bags"" because the portions are HUGE (and from my experience, tasted great too). And the bread basket is full of hot bread. Yum! However, if you're just coming here to buy some dessert, you're better off ordering to-go at the bakery. I'd wait for a full meal, but not for the dessert.

With my constant dining out lately, I had to refrain from indulging like a carnivore, and go with something on the lighter side.  I thought I was able to escape the giant portions with the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad, but I should've known better for the price.  I could've sworn the salad weighed at least 10 pounds.  Although it was quite tasty, I had to bring it home.  There was plenty leftover for all three meals the next day.   I got a chance to sample the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls that my buddy ordered.  It was pretty good, but why would you get sushi at a place like this.  In fact, the one thing that annoyed my was the menu.  Everything seems to be a ""specialty.""  I don't see anything that special.  Sure, change it by 10 percent, and you got yourself a new creation.  This is just some sick way to get patrons to scan the menu, causing more confusion.   I suppose the menu ordeal was saved when our waitress came over.  She was very friendly and helpful.  She came by so much to make sure we were doing ok, she should have joined us for dinner.   I had left just enough room for some dessert sampling.  The Fresh Strawberry Shortcake and the White Chocolate Carmel Latte Cheesecake sealed the deal.   Overall, the evening went well.  We ate, we sang, we paid, we left.  What more do you want from a birthday dinner?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1340

Now normally if I don't think something is up to par I'll eat, pay and just not come back. However, this was terrible, I asked my waitress for a dish without sauce. Which she brought. ""Great, now I can eat"" I thought. No, no, while my salmon was at least passable now, my asparagus was over cooked,and my steak was raw, completely raw and cold.

I can't complain that the selection is weak - the menu is spiral bound for goodness sake. But then it makes me wonder how good the food is since there are a bajillion items on the menu.

The food was just like every other Cheesecake factory to me; overrated with unfathomably high calorie counts (if something has that many calories it better taste damn good!).  This last week when I went here I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  It was pretty good, and came with some tasty mash potatoes and asparagus that I didn't eat.  However, they have a pretty similar dish at BJ's that I think tastes much better and is much cheaper as well.   To finish off my meal, I got a slice of strawberry cheesecake.  This was the forth dessert item I have tried from the Cheesecake factory over the last two weeks, and I was not impressed by any of them.  I honestly believe that the frozen Cheesecake factory cakes that you can buy at your local supermarket taste better than the ones at the actual restaurant.  Strange, I know.  I just think their desserts are overrated.

Also, if you don't like your table neighbors hearing your conversation then I recommend asking for a booth right away. We sat literally 6inches apart from another table I was so uncomfortable!

This location though takes a hit b/c the parking situation is not ideal.  You have tons of mall attendees to compete with and the $5 valet service they offer is ridiculous.  You can offer the service, but that doesn't make up for the stupidity of location. Next, our service at this location was pretty lackluster.  Besides being slow, the orders came out wrong.  That can happen anywhere, but normally the staff would react better.   If you do want a good piece of cheesecake then there is nowhere better to go.  3 out of 5, and hoping next time will offer a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1360

Teno C.,"Fremont, CA",7,3,,4.0,11/9/2009,"F.E.A.S.T. Rating: 3.6 Cheesecake is one of my greatest weaknesses. I like plain cheesecake, cheesecake with toppings, even that cheesecake mix-in-a-box. Thus, I suppose it makes sense that I get around to reviewing Cheesecake Factory, a chain renown for their selections. This review, however, takes into account that they serve other things besides slice o' heaven. Financial (10%) - 4.0 Meal prices are reasonable, especially considering how big portions are. Few main dishes exceed $20, which is about right for a mid-level chain. A slice of cheesecake is pretty expensive (in the $6-8 range), but is big enough to share with a friend or two. Getting whole cheesecakes will give you a good wallet walloping (typically ~$26 for 7"" and ~$50 for 10""). Expression (15%) - 4.0 CF likes to showcase their cheesecakes; that is their strongest point. From the whole pies on display, to the decorative patterns found on individual slices, CF wins the most points for this category with their eponymous dessert. The main courses are cleanly presented, and heaping portions kinda has its own morbidly fun appeal. Speaking of which, they always seem to empty an industrial-sized can of whipped cream onto your slice of cheesecake! Ambiance (20%) - 3.5 Did I walk into a Las Vegas hotel? Familiar wall prints, classical columns...all that's missing is a Roman statue :) The waiting area, cheesecake counter, restrooms, and kitchen doors all share common space. I prescribe a little caution when wading through this overcrowded area. Expect to get to know your neighbors and their food when squeezing into the cramped seating, especially at tables adjacent to the bar where stools are placed almost haphazardly. Service (25%) - 3.5 As I previously mentioned, it's incredibly busy. And that's unfortunate because they don't take reservations. Instead, you're given an ETA and a buzzer device that notifies you when seating becomes available. Typical wait times on a crowded evening are about 45 min. Service can be somewhat uneven due to crowding and hectic pace (a true measure of service when you see how your server reacts in such a dynamic environment). And don't come to CF if your party exceeds 4. They will try to seat you, but expect to add another 30 minutes to that wait time. However, CF staff are genuinely friendly and accommodating. Taste (30%) - 3.5 The food is actually not bad considering the focus on dessert and diverse menu. The only problem I have is that CF tends to get the key flavors wrong (the syrupy sauces may be to blame). The Crispy Spicy Beef has so much potential, but is salty despite the sweet-spicy sauce. The Spicy Cashew Chicken is sweeter than it is spicy. On the other hand, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp struck almost all the right notes despite its funny name haha. The curry, peanuts, chiles, and coconut surprisingly don't overpower each other. I'm also a fan of their breads. What about cheesecakes that I already haven't mentioned? I brought a White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake to a picnic once and ppl refused to let it thaw. Gone in 60 seconds!

Jessica S.,"Thornton, CO",13,3,,4.0,10/4/2008,"My first time going to the Cheesecake Factory was pretty good. I was really intimidated by the menu, which was really a book. I didn't like that it was so small and there were three or four pages of entrees. I couldn't compare descriptions well, so I ended up just choosing something off the chicken page. The fact that there were ads in the menu was also pretty strange. Given the prices and the traffic there (there were at least 1015 occupied tables or so around 2.30pm-3pm while we were there), you would think Cheesecake Factory could afford to print their menus without having advertisers. I got the Orange Chicken, which was pretty good. It basically tasted like Chinese food that you could get anywhere, but was still good. It was a hefty portion, even ordered off the lunch menu. My boyfriend got a burger and he was raving over it the whole time. I wanted some dipping sauce for my fries (I got fries instead of white rice and veggies that were actually peas and carrots) and it took forever to flag down our server. She maybe refilled our drinks once. I'm not sure why she was so busy, as it appeared that she only had three occupied tables in her section. I had to get dessert because, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. I got Tirimisu Cheesecake which was amazing. It was too rich for me to eat all at once, so I got half boxed up and ate it later. Overall, it was pretty good. I'll be going back, though I'll make sure to go at lunchtime.

In essence, people eat at restaurants in order to: one, have good food, two, have good company and most importantly to enjoy the time/experience.  It was a Tuesday night and the Cheesecake Factory wasn't very busy. We were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our waitress took drink orders, brought bread out, and then took meal orders. After doing all that, she disappeared. We ran out of bread and water, thus, started looking for her to ""serve"" us. Since we couldn't find her, we asked a busboy to grab us some bread and another waiter was so kind to refill the water. Thanks! Our waitress comes back to take orders at the other tables, but doesn't bother to check on our table. Great! She now brings out some of the meals, however; she doesn't have mine. She doesn't say anything and just walks away. Common courtesy would have been to let me know that my food will be out shortly, but no.. she just left.

Katie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",163,407,338,3.0,2/17/2010,"When you think of Cheesecake Factory, you think of the fancy place for overpriced American food. Don't get me wrong, their food is fantastic, but just expense and the portions are huge. In my opinion, I rather have a regular sized portion for a good price. Who needs more than they can eat anyway?  Lets start off with the environment. It's impossible to find parking especially on a Fri or Sat night. It's right across from Santana Row so people like to park in this area and just walk across to Santana Row after shopping or eating at Valley Fair. You can always Valet your car, but people in San Jose just don't do that... The restaurant is beautifully decorated and truly fancy. You can come here in a prom dress and you won't feel out of place. There is lots of seating, but this restaurant gets really busy, really fast. And they don't take reservations and that is horrible on their part. They refused to let me make a reservation before prom, I mean we aren't willing to wait 2-3 hours for a table for 11 when we have a prom to go to. You're losing out on a $200+ bill. Too bad for them right? Before I came here for my 15th birthday and I literally waited 2 hours for a table for my huge group. It was horrible. I vowed never to come back with a group bigger than 5 people.  The service is great. They are top notch for a chain restaurant, Usually you expect service like at Chili's or Applebees, but no. They are really fantastic. They help you order, answer any questions and are always attentive on refilling drinks. They also don't mind giving you more bread. And by the way, the bread here is FANTASTIC. So good. Comes out warm so the butter just melts on to the bread. Just don't get too carried away with eating bread, remember the food portions are HUGE. You'll be lucky just to finish half.  For appetizers, I have tried the sliders and the spinach and artichoke dip. Usually I just get full off the bread but sometimes I like to change things up. The sliders were just okay, I wouldn't order it again. The spinach artichoke dip isn't like the normals ones you get from CPK or Applebees. Here they use real spinach and you can tell. It's good, but I have to admit I like the frozen ""fake"" stuff better. I also tried the stuffed mushrooms which are not on the appetizer menu but instead on small plates and snack menu. They are really good. I recommend order from the ""snacks"" menu to compliment your bread while you wait for the main course.  The pasta menu, that is what I usually order. I tried most of their pasta and they are all very good. My favorite is the Louisiana chicken pasta. Spicy and yummy and PERFECTION. Its so good. MUST try. My second favorite is the Pasta Da Vinci which is full of mushrooms and I love MUSHROOMS. Avoid this pasta if you hate mushrooms. The sauce is different from a cream based or tomato based sauce. Always nice to change it up! The Alfredo here is just okay, I wouldn't order it just because I love CPK's better. I rather get the garlic noodles which is a bit healthier since it doesn't have a cream based sauce. REMEMBER the pasta portions are HUGE I recommend you share. Even if you come during lunch, the lunch sizes are huge too but the price is cut down.  Moving on the MEAT. I have tried some chicken dishes here and my favorite is the crispy chicken costoletta. You won't be disappointed. You get the fresh asparagus and mashed potatoes... So good. Usually I don't like lemon based sauces, but this was so delicious. Love it. The shepherd's pie is okay. Their burgers are MEH. Let's just say you don't come to cheesecake factory just to order a burger. Their fries are stringy too. I don't like that. I also tried their California Cheesesteak. It was really greasy and drenched in oil. It was dripping. Kinda made me sick to my stomach. Wouldn't try it again.  As for salads, I have only tried the Caesar and the Factory chopped salad under the appetizer salad menu. Because their salads are HUGE as well, it was smart to order from the appetizer salad menu. I really liked the chopped salad. Some people think that it looks like baby food cause it's all chopped up, but it was really good. I got everything into my mouth with just once scoop. It was delicious the vinagrette was savory and tasteful. I would go back and try their regular salads as well.   Moving on to desserts! Now you GOT to know that you're getting cheesecake when you're here. I mean there is NO point whatsoever to come to cheesecake factory and NOT get dessert. They will look at you like you're crazy... Okay, maybe not, but I would.. My all time favorite cheesecake is the White chocolate raspberry truffle. Its like heaven in your mouth. I LOVE it. So delicious and not too sweet. Best cheesecake EVER. My second favorite is the red velvet, then the 30th anniversary and lastly the brownie sundae. You won't be disappointed in whatever you choose GUARANTEED.

They forgot to heat it, I guess.  Now about the cheesecake. At first, I refused to eat their cheesecake. They are NOT BAKED. They are refrigerator cheesecakes. I finally got off my high horse and tried them. I had to admit, they were good, even if they are not baked. Their chocolate cake and apple turnover was very good, too. Service is always friendly and prompt to make up for the long wait and no reservation policy..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1420

This place always makes me late for whatever I'm going to afterwards. I can eat an entire meal in like 20mins but I have to wait 1.5hrs to get it regardless of location.  Service is pretty good most of the time. I've had numerous apologies for the long wait times followed by fast service.

Laura G.,"Newark, CA",8,6,1,2.0,7/22/2008,"We received a gift card to this place a year and a half ago, but never went because the wait is always ridiculously long. However, my family and I went on Monday night around 5:15, and the wait was only five minutes. I guess that is the time to go if you don't want to wait.  At first glance, we were overwhelmed with the size of the menu. My thoughts are when the menu is too big, how can the food be specialized? Anyway, we ended up making our selections. My daughter's (ages 3 and 5) liked their cheese, avocado and bacon omelet (can't really mess that up), but thought the potatoes were too spicy because of the red pepper all over them. I thought my Chicken Avocado Sandwich was delicious and I was pleased with my meal. However, my husband did not feel the same. His Arnold Palmer had some black ""floaters"" in it that appeared to be rotten produce of some kind. Furthermore, it the middle of eating his Seared Tuna Salad, he discovered a long curly hair entangled in his lettuce. Yuck! The manager was nice and took it off of our bill.  We took home some cheesecake, since the mood had changed drastically since our arrival. I did not enjoy the Tres Leches Cheesecake. The wet cake on the bottom of cheesecake tasted too mushy for me. but the Tiramisu Cheesecake was delicious. Overall, I think the decor is light and cozy and our server, Stephanie, was super sweet. Unfortunately, I don't see us going there again unless it's to pick up some cheesecake to go! The menu wasn't that exciting and the wait is usually too long.

We asked what's happening: the table is still not available. 1h15... same thing... 1h30: finally we can have a table! We arrived there at 8:30 and started eating at 10:15. Great ! 2- the dishes my friends and I took were TOO SALTED. This is not a good or fancy cuisine as they try to advertise. It is good for a chain restaurant. That's it.  Huge portions, nothing ""delicate"" - salt, oil, meat, sauce... (i got the Shepherd's Pie and my friend the Seared Tuna Salad - this one was great though). Same for desert: huge portion! Good cheesecake... but TOO SWEET. I only felt the cream and sugar. What's the point? 1500 calories for the cake... 1700 calories for my dish... so now what? Should I go make a marathon ? Can't they make something smaller, healthier and tastier? I come from France, so maybe that is why I am picky about food.  I was surprised to see people getting nicely dressed to go to the cheesecake factory... They are other restaurants in the bay area, for the same price range (and some with a 1 star at the Michelin Guide), where you can have good quality food, healthier and tastier... and no need to wait 1:30 ! And you can make reservations ! Cheesecake is good if you eat like 3 and love super salted and sweet food. Service was nice... but they did not do anything for the fact we waited extra 45 min.

It was crunchy with cheese and crab oozing out during each bite. There is sweet sauce that compliments it very well. I was not hungry that night, so I ordered the philly steak sandwich. It was pretty good at first, but for some reason, it tasted colder as I reached the middle of the sandwich.

The charm of this place is the fact that you can get ANYTHING that you want. The menu is like 48 pages long. Personally, I would rather have five things that are thoughtfully produced, than five hundred that are thrown together haphazardly. Yeah the cheesecake is good and big, but unless you really have a thing for cheesecake, I don't think it's a life-altering experience. Let me tell you about the buffalo blasters appetizers. That's a blaster before and after you eat it, to not be completely graphic. The portions here are HUGE, if that's what you're into.

I tried the Chicken Madeira, which comes topped with mushrooms and asparagus and a huge side of mashed potatoes. It was delicious! The chicken was so tender and infused with the sauce.

For our main entrees, Cal got the Caesar and I had the the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. I thought Cal's salad was pretty good, different because it was more garlicy than we're used to, but still good. I loved loved loved my sliders. They were super cute and fun to eat. I could only eat 1 and a half (there were 4) because I ate too much of the yummy bread. I got the vanilla honey coffee drink, and it was good, but so sweet that I couldn't finish it.

I was amazed by the vastness of the menu.  I think its ridiculous to have such a large menu encompassing so many types of food.  They could cut the menu in half and I still think it would be more than adequate.  She had the Steak Diane, I had the Cajun Jambalaya.  The former was delicious, the latter was too dry.  The portion sizes of both were very generous.  If you finish your entree here and don't suffer from food coma immediately after I would be impressed.     So the food was OK overall, I just wish that they pare down the menu and the quantity size (just a bit) and focus their energy on delivering dishes that taste better.  Also, the cheesecake is delicious but $7 dollars per slice?  Maybe they sprinkle crack on it?

The servers are usually attentive and fun, and I forgive them for slow service when it's packed in there, which is most nights.

Chris C.,"Union City, CA",51,549,15,3.0,5/29/2007,"The GF and I decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory because we had a $50 Gift Certificate.  Cheesecake Factory is a mid-upper mid level restruarant chain that caters to 3 main items:  1)  About 30+ different selection of Cheesecake, 2) A pretty wide menu and big menu ranging from American, Chinese, & Southwest 3)  Humgo Portion sizes. We got here about 5:30ish which was just in time to beat the dinner time rush.  Cheesecake Factor has this upscale venician feel to it.  Very open, very pleasant, but with all the open space it can get very loud.  We waited about 5-10 minutes before we were seated.  We were seated at a nice table and the waiter had the menus to us right away.  CF has a pretty big menu selection.  Most of their food options range either in the American, Asian, or Southwest realm.  They have a big selection of salads, sandwiches, and pasta with several vegetarian options.  They also have a pretty big mixed drink selection if you want to get your drink on.  Most appetizers here range in the $5-$8 range and most meals you can get under $17. The GF and I decided on the small house salad, the Corn Tamale Cakes, I got the Cuban Sandwich and she got the Grilled Cheese.  We also ordered drinks and I got the Raspberry Lemonade.  The Raspberry Lemonade was pretty good, it also helps that I have a sweet tooth, so I didn't mind it being on the sweet side.  We got the Corn Tamale Cakes and small house salad, and we forgot the number item at Cheesecake Factory, everything is served in SUPER HUGE SIZE.  The small house salad would put most restaurants regular salads to shame.  It was huge.  And the Corn Tamale Cakes, 3 big corn cakes stacked with salsa, sour cream, and slices of avacados.  After eating about half, we were both stuffed.  Then came the sandwiches, both were HUGE.  About triple the size of most places.  Both my Cuban and Grilled Cheese were pretty good.  The fries... they were very forgetful.  We both barely got through a quarter of our sandwiches and about half of our fries.  There was just TOO MUCH FOOD! We save enough room for the Apple Crisp (though they have 30+ selections of cheesecake, the GF isn't much of cheesecake fan).  There was more than enough for the two.  We probably only ate about a third of it.  We ended up taking home 2 bags worth of food which ended up being lunch and dinner the next day.  Not too bad that we got almost 3 meals for about $55 including tip. After eating here, I've come to realize, places like the Cheesecake Factory is why Americans are fat.  We were one of the few people there who didn't finish their plate full of food, which was AMAZING.  But overall, I enjoyed coming here.  I thought the food was good and the ambiance was pleasant, and the server well trained.  I know people who like to knock a place because it's a ""chain"", but if you like the food, the service was good, and the ambiance pleasing, why knock it for being a chain.  Solid 3.5 Resturant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1520

Dates - 5 of 5 - AWESOME!!! the dates were stuffed with parmesean cheese, a little too much, perhaps a nuttier cheese would have raised it another level, but it was very tasty - they used a whole strip of bacon where half of one would have worked, i love them for that!  It was crispy and had some pieces of fat, which i also like, and it smelled soooo good too.  They roast them, btw. Wild Mushroom Pizzette - 3 of 5 - bigger than i thought it was going to be, but small enough to where i was not full afterwards.  Crust was nice and crispy and tasted fresh, it was topped with mushrooms, garlic, herbs & cheese - no sauce - which was pleasant - i dont know if its because i ate the dates first but it wasnt as hot as i would have liked - mushrooms were not over-cooked like on most pizza's but it didnt have that right temperature i enjoy when eating pizza - herbs and cheese were fine. Service - 5 of 5 - James is good peoples.  He had this weird customer like 3 seats to my left, and dude was asking lot's of lame questions and was quite demanding and somehow James kept a good spirit and delivered the same awesome service when most would have been annoyed, commend him for that - what made me truly know that this customer was weird was when he started talking about his Houston Rockets and how when they win the title Tracy McGrady was going to be named MVP - to this i laughed, but alas, it was not a joke, he was dead serious, i politely turned and finished my food and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1520

Normally, I would experience a waiter who neglects my table while treating their other tables wonderfully (possibly bc I look like I'm 13 and assume I don't tip well? idk), but this waiter really knows how to take care of his guests.  I ordered the shrimp scampi and my boyfriend ordered the Shrimp BLT. We also got the new cheesecake--Reeses Peanut Butter Cheesecake. Shrimp Scampi: For all you shrimp lovers..if you've never tried this, you are missing out! They give about 6 or 7 pieces of Jumbo shrimp that are lightly battered and seasoned perfectly, adorned on top of a pile of angel hair pasta. The sauce is delectable and our waiter even gave us extra sauce on the side, without me having to ask! (+++!) Shrimp BLT: Once crowned the worst, most unhealthiest sandwich ever! BUT its soo soo good. I love BLT sandwiches, but throw some shrimp in there--I'm sold! Reeses Peanut Butter Cheesecake: From what our waiter told us, this is their newest addition. I'm glad that they collaborated and made this beautiful piece of cheesecake. It definitely taste like a peanut butter cup. I have an exceptionally big sweet tooth so this is definitely not for those who aren't a fan of sweets nor for those watching their sugar intake. Overall, I had a great experience here. The bottomless bread basket is superb, the food was wonderful, and the service was great. I guess I'll have to cross my fingers and hope I get the same great service the next time around.  Ps. I recommend the Passion Fruit Mojito...it's YUMMY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1080

Tiffany H.,"San Jose, CA",219,304,168,4.0,10/17/2010,"My mom and I were already at Valley Fair when we started to get really hungry. We decided to eat here since it was the closes restaurant we would actually eat at next to Valley Fair. Came in got seated in less then 5 minutes. Did I mention this was a Wednesday night. If it wasn't we probably would have had to wait for hours. Due to the time, which we came at around 8pm. I love the brown bread they give here. I hate the white bread it's to hard.  For our starter we got the buffalo wings. 3.5 stars. They were tasty and for 2 people it was a fair amount. My mom and I have a big appetite. As my entree I got the Charbroiled Flat Iron Steak cooked medium rare. LOVED IT. I love the way the steak is cooked and the sauce that's it's drench in. The way it was marinated was perfect for my taste buds. 5 stars for the steak! My mom got noodles with meat sauce and sausage. It's not on the menu she kind of created her own pasta. (I didn't know you can do that) I can't review on what she got because, I didn't eat it myself.  For our dessert we got the Red Velvet Cheesecake and we ordered 2 scoops of Vanilla ice cream on the side of that. You can never go wrong with Red Velvet but, it gets a little too sweet after awhile and you just want to stop eating it. The vanilla ice cream really helped eased the sweetness of the Red Velvet/Cheese. Pretend Vanilla ice cream is milk, and you'll get what I am talking about. I will give this dessert 4 stars.

It does indeed have something for everyone.  I had a avacado-filled eggroll (how do they DO that?!) that was marvelous, along with a corn fritter.  My entree was the most beautiful barbeque chicken salad.  It was nicely dressed (equally throughout the entire salad) and beautifully presented.  It was waaaaay to big to eat in one sitting, they cheerfully boxed it up for me. I ordered the raspberry white-chocolate cheesecake, so that I could take something home to Dr. R..  It was very sweet and very good.  I had a bite of the red-velvet cheesecake (ok, two bites), purely for research purposes.  That was very, very good also. Service was very solicitous.  Sodas were refilled promptly, our entrees all came at the same time and were exactly as ordered.  I was very impressed by the legion of wait-staff.  They took very good care of our group of eleven people.

K T.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,,5.0,10/8/2014,"We dine here at the Santa Clara, CA location a few times throughout the year but specifically come for our daughters' birthdays as The Cheesecake Factory is their favorite restaurant. However we always forget to call ahead to have their birthday cheesecake/dessert defrosted before coming every year for each birthday event. This time, I made certain to call ahead and Francine, front end greeter did an amazing job. I could hear in the background it was very busy. She still managed to help me by asking if she could put me on hold so she could run to their bakery to find out what cheesecakes were available and in what sizes. When she came back I had another question for her in which she politely asked if she could call me back as she was going to be off in another half hour and would then be able to better assist me. What a wonderful employee to spend her nonworking unpaid time to help me with my question which was pricing on the cakes. She indeed called me back with the cake prices and additionally gave me some great news that she had spoken with the manager and they could give me a reservation for our dinner party since they don't normally do reservations after 5pm (we were coming at 7:30pm and taking our chances walking in.) She also made sure that two of her associates knew that we were coming, had a cake reserved and set out to be defrosted and that I would be bringing in candles.  When we got there, everything was taking care of as promised and even our server, Justin was already briefed on everything. He tended to our table exceptionally well, always cheerful and made sure we were happy and had everything we needed. We tried new dishes and they were all amazing and delicious. The dinner servings were as usual, very generous and everyone had enough leftovers for a full meal to eat the next day...really it was that much food! We also love how they write Happy Birthday on the plate that holds the cheesecake. A big THANK YOU and KUDOS to everyone involved especially Francine and Justin. After our dinner I made sure to speak with Mandy, the restaurant manager to let her know how thankful and impressed we were with both Francine and Justin and that although Francine had already gone home, we wanted the manager to know how much we appreciated her employees' professionalism and attentiveness to our needs.

The service, unlike the food, is good. But when I factor in the fact that the typical wait time is around an hour, by the time i sit and order, ANY service is going to be good service. What baffles me is how this place is always so packed?!? I don't get it. The food just isn't that great t me. Maybe it's because it's at a mall.

Sylvia S.,"Novato, CA",42,178,44,4.0,11/5/2009,"OK, so this is one of those big chains with very little originality, but I have to give it snaps for having some delish food and dessert.   The downsides are: long waits with no reservations, crappy parking and it gets so loud in here that you can barely hear yourself, much less anyone in your group trying to talk to you. The upsides: huge menu, good service (usually), yummy and fresh food and, of course, CHEESECAKE!! My favorite savory dishes here lately are the asian ones - Caramel chicken and Orange chicken.  Both are vey good.  I also like the crab cakes, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, Shepard's Pie, Meatloaf and Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. As far as cheesecake goes, I haven't had a bad one yet!  My faves are the Snicker's, Adam's Peanut Butter Cup, Pumpkin and Godiva.  YUM! Be ready to drop about $25 per person when all if said and done.  Another option is to use their ""curbside to go"", which I do from time to time.  You can get out of there for less money without buying the expensive soda and other extras.  Plus, it's fast and easy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1080

As I recall from past experiences here, this pasta dish usually comes out extremely tasty and flavorful. But we must've came on their off night because it was super dry and bland, and both the pasta and chicken seemed overcooked. Some extra sauce would have definitely helped.  Luckily, the Fried Mac n Cheese was a hit though! MMMmmmm never had it made this way where the mac and cheese was stuffed inside a crispy fried ball. It was beautifully presented on the plate and its uniqueness made me love it even more! Comes with 4 nicely sized mac balls.

Service was a bit odd as the servers remove your glass from the table and come back with it later.

Phil W.,"South San Francisco, CA",357,67,32,4.0,3/29/2007,"People complain about this one and the one in the city, yet its always packed and both get a ton of reviews so obviously a lot of people still go. I like this one much better than Union Square. The line is much shorter and the service is way better. Considering how packed both get, I don't see why they just don't open a few more. Probably the whole less is more attitude, like In and Out. I like the food. Yes they have a lot to choose from, but I'm a really good chooser. Everyone always ask me to choose and I haven't let them down yet. I totally adore their appetizers. My favorites are the spicy ahi tempura rolls, tex-mex rolls, and firecracker salmon rolls. I guess I have a thing for rolls. I've tried the sliders, fried mac & cheese, and calamari. Those are more or less ok, great for sharing. I'd definitely stay away from the popcorn shrimp, all batter no shrimp. The chicken strips can sometimes be a little cold in the center, I guess they haven't figured out the microwave cook times yet. The potstickers I'm sure came from right out of bag someone picked up at Ranch 99 before coming into work. Otherwise, let's move on to entrees. Their menu is like ""everything you wanted to ever eat and more."" You can really sit here for 20 minutes pondering over the menu, especially if you're hungry, everything sounds good. Seriously, you can really get anything here, chicken done 96 ways, beef done another 49 ways, and way more pastas than you can imagine. I've been here at least 20 times and I'm not even half way through their menu, believe me when I say I eat off everyone's plate at my table.  A couple of high and low lights: Kobe burger- American Kobe is no where near Japanese Kobe, not worth the premium in price. I would say something along the lines of top instead of fatty sirloin. Shepards Pie- I can make this with a can of Chunky beef and vegetable soup and some instant potatoes. Soggy and bland. Grilled portabello on a bun- bread and mushrooms, go figure.  Beef Goulash- Must be what was eaten in a gulag for all those people to die of malnutrition. Tasteless, beef was way over-cooked and not tender at all, sauce a bit runny. Shrimp Scampi- pretty tasty, a little on the oily side, but well flavored with plenty of garlic and parsley, quite buttery, great with practically anything. Cajun Jambalaya- very good, spicy and rich, almost authentic taste, loaded with chicken and shrimp, great over rice. Cajun-style Ribeye- it says marinated for 36 hours, tastes great, very even taste throughout the meat, have it rare you won't regret it. One of the best cajun steaks I've had outside of Vegas.  Overall I'm usually quite satisfied with the meals I've had here. Compared to Union Square, it's at least half the wait time. On weekday early evenings, I can usually get a table within 10 minutes. Oh I almost forgot, the cheesecake. They have about 30 different kinds of cheesecake here, the consistency is excellent, I like mine usually a little thick and firm with the crust slightly moist. I find most of their specialty cheesecakes to be a tad too sweet for my Asian taste buds so I still with the original. Do not, under any circumstances, get the 6 carb diet cheesecake. It really tastes like bad cardboard, as opposed to good cardboard you find in the freezer section of your local supermarket.

I hadn't been here in ages and I'd forgotten how HUGE the portions are. I had a lunch size salad and it was pretty much the regular dinner portion at a normal restaurant. I'd imagine the regular sized salads could be split amongst like three people.

This place has such a huge menu with EVERYTHING on it (""Mexican"", ""Thai"", ""English"", American...) and a full bar, but I don't really like cheesecake, their meat is usually dry, and they just don't do anything exceptionally well.

Our waiter was real nice! He gave us some coupons to use for a free slice of cheesecake. We were very delighted. I did try their red velvet. It's good, but the cream was a bit too sweet for me. This place can get very crowded at night since it's in the ValleyFair mall. Waiting might be really really long. They don't take reservations for big groups on weekends.

Came here on a Thursday afternoon, you would expect no one, but it was packed! They said they could seat us immediately and we followed the hostess. When we got within 100 feet of our table, the hostess stopped, did a 180 turn and told us to stand there and wait for our table to be cleaned. and ""THERE"" was right in the middle of COMPLETE CHAOS.  We stood there for at least 5 minutes just waiting. Ridiculous. Finally got seated and our waiter was terrible. He took forever to come take our order. All we got was cheesecake and that took at least 20 minutes!! When we came he mixed up the order. How hard is it even to DO THAT FOR 3 PEOPLE. God... I also hate this place because they try to specialize in way too many things. Is it Asian, American, Mexican, Italian?!?!?! What the hell is it!?!?!

When we arrived, we only had to wait 5 minutes before being seated. When the menu was handed to us, I was already overwhelmed. There are so many options to choose from! My all time favorite is the Pasta Da Vinci. My parents and I decided on the Pasta Da Vinci and the Chicken Bellagio. We shared these two entrees because we knew we wouldn't be able to finish 3 entrees. The Pasta da Vinci was very delicious. I love the sauce that they use! The Chicken Bellagio was breaded chicken with angel hair pasta. The chicken was good, but the pasta was drenched in olive oil! As we were working our way through these entrees, there were still left overs! We were getting full but had to save room for dessert. We decided on the Tiramisu cheesecake and the Dulce de Leche cheesecake. The tiramisu was very coffeish, but was still good. I thought the Dulce de Leche was going to be sweet since it had caramel in it, but it wasn't. The candied walnuts in the whip cream went very well with it. I was so full but I kept wanting to eat more of it!  The service was pretty good until the restaurant became busier. We had a female server who was pretty quick about things until she had to go on her break. We got this male server and he was no where in sight when we needed him.

Best appetizer = Dynamite shrimp, perfectly crispy tempura shrimp with a yummy ""dynamite dipping sauce"". Only big problem is their food(like their actual entrees). I have yet to be really amazed by their food! I mean, I wouldn't say their food is gross... but I wouldn't say it's yummy either. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - Not as spicy as it sounds. Actually it's pretty plain.  Four Cheese Pasta - Too cheesy but not the good kind of cheesy in my definition&I usually love cheesiness! Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - Nothing too special. It's actually kind of plain except for the little fried tortilla strip things on top. That was the best part. Mmmmm. Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried tomatos - Meh! I expected a little bit more creaminess (the description does say garlic, cream, etc!). But it was nothing close to it. In fact, it tasted like really really oily noodles is all. Oily to the point of oil dripping off each fork-full. Yum? Even the chicken of was tasteless. Okay, I will say this one was pretty gross. Some kind of chicken thing - Overcooked & dry but I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes & vegetables that came with it! :) I've decided that if I ever come back, I will stick to getting just appetizers & desserts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1160

You know you've arrived. If nothing else, Cheesecake Factory makes the waiting area at least spacious enough. Our party of 8 loitered for almost an hour before our pager finally buzzed. I suppose there was no way around it. Thursday night, 7p, what are the chances of being seated immediately. Nevertheless, we happily trudged to our table. We devoured the brown bread loaf and quickly asked for more. For dinner, I was torn between trying a new dish or one of my old favorites - like the Jambalaya or Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp - I went for a new entree  this time - the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta ($12.95). Chicken, asparagus bits with red and yellow Peppers, the pasta dish was colorful. The spicy chipotle parmesan cream sauce wasn't actually very spicy. Could have been kicked up a notch. As usual though, the portion was gia-normous and I had plenty to take home for round 2 the following day. For dessert, we tried the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake ($6-ish). It tastes just like how it sounds - rich deep chocolate. And of course finished with a cloud of light airy whipped cream. Great for sharing.

Yuyu Z.,"San Jose, CA",63,22,10,4.0,6/10/2012,"I love Cheesecake Factory, probably one of my favorite restaurant. The food is super yummy. I recommend Chicken Bellagio, Chicken Picata, and as appetizer the Buffalo blast. Their food is a bit pricey but the portion is well worth the price. I always attempt to save room for cheesecake as dessert but it never happens. I think they have great waitress and waiters every now and then you get one that's not great but usually I love my waiter/waitress. One of my favorite sides to get there as not yummy as it sounds is a side of fries with ranch. They have THEEE best fries and THEEE best ranch. And trust me, I've eaten a lot of different fries and ranch before. Their complementary bread is also super yum! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's ALWAYS busy. Sometime the wait is not that long but sometime you could be waiting for HOURS. Sometimes they accept reservations sometimes they don't. The restaurant itself is beautiful, take a moment to take in the setting. Then look up around the ceiling and pillars its actually really pretty. The lighting is pretty darn romantic at night, I'd say it's a great place to have a nice romantic dinner. What more can I say?

Terry H.,"San Jose, CA",1101,655,15,3.0,1/31/2009,"Have you ever had a headache that sits right behind your eyes so that you even smell things differently along with a strange inability to hear and see the TV like you are used to doing... a nosee'-sinusee' pressure with radiating ache to the point where you aren't sure if you are coming down with a cold or flu or something worse? A tiring uncomfortableness that seeks to drive you to bed way too early so that you can't watch any of the daily shows you have TIVO'd. No? Then neither have I.  Really, here's the review. Time to get serious and use my vocabulary that education has afforded me the ability to complete somewhat rationally. Maybe it's because I just broke my Atkins diet with a huge Alps-sized mountain of garlic mashed potatoes and my body wasn't used to it after 30 days. Or because I ordered my usual decaff coffee and ended up drinking 3 or 4 cups. Or because the crashing din inside of The Cheesecake Factory was so loud that I could barely hear what the people next to me were saying. Me thinks it was a combination of the three. The bottom line is that it is aspirin time which isn't a good sign for the Factory getting 5 stars from me. We came here for a birthday party, 11 awesome, sweet, diverse and hungry people. But in looking over the menu I felt like I was reading a textbook for an upcoming university Chemistry course with ads inside. Never have I been to a restaurant that had so many different choices, I said to my next-to companion that if I chose a different item everyday I wouldn't be able to go through from front to back in 4 months. Several of the party had eaten at the Cheesecake before so they warned me off of the appetizers, bread and the pre-salad. I listened and was glad that I did as the meal unfolded. My entree, after much mental anguish in making a proper decision, was the salisbury steak. Why? Because I haven't had that in ages and I frankly was missing it. When my plate arrived, I was stunned by the massiveness of the offering. Tons of crisp green beans warmed slightly with an essence of lemon-vinegar dressing. Crunchy to the tooth and full of flavor. Personally, it is really hard to mess up green beans if you remember to just barely cook them. I love eating them raw in the bag straight from the grocery store... naturally full of vitamins, minerals and sugar.  Then I sampled their garlic mashed potatoes, in first looking at it, I knew it was going to be like scaling the Matterhorn. They were creamy with pureed mixed with small chunks of red skin and garlic bite, not overpowering garlic but subtle and elegant. It is refreshing to be served real mashed potatoes, not powdered or premade but like you make them at home. So far, so good. I'm kind of wierd when I eat. If I really like something I tend to keep on eating that part of the meal before I move on to the rest. It's not something that I like doing and other people have commented on it but it's a habit none the less. Guess I have to try and break that one.  On to the salisbury steak. It was brown and juicy and covered with onions and gravy just like a salisbury steak should be but this is where the meal began to fall apart due to the fact that it didn't have much flavor. When I ordered it, I was under the mistaken impression that mushrooms would be involved in a mighty way but they seem to have instead run off to the hills, nowhere to be found. Now for me salisbury steak and mushrooms go together like pancakes and maple syrup, peanut butter and jelly, pizza and pepperoni, Cabernet Sauvignon and pork chops, the beach and sunglasses. Unfortunately, my finale fell flat. I didn't even finish it. As for the birthday girl, she ordered a wonderful chicken dish that included a half-chicken, some delicious looking carrots and a bigger dollop of potatoes than even I had. She was totally happy and even took what she couldn't finish home in a big, black box. It was her day, so I'm glad she chose the right thing for her. She also ordered an amazing smelling vanilla cheesecake covered with a festive mound of whipped cream and curlie-cue chocolate syrup that tied the plate all together. I even took a picture of it, my first picture ever of food too. Unfortunately, it was awfully dark by the time it arrived so it came out poorly. Next time, I'll use a flash and post it for you all to see. Would I be back? Well, it was awfully expensive even though they wouldn't let me pay for anything and it was so noisy that if you ever went here on a date or business meeting, you wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of the conversation, just a lot of blank nods and teethy smiles. The food was good but not remarkable, a little above average I guess if I want to be nice and I always want to be nice. But if someone else wanted to go here, I would say ""Yes"" just to make them happy because I like to have happy dates. Me! Meh!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1160
Salina M.,"Campbell, CA",8,38,34,4.0,9/2/2009,"I eat here quite often and I have to say that even though I am not really a fan of corporate giant restaurants taking over and pushing out the little mom and pop shops, I love this place! I tend to eat really early or really late...9:30pm or later and it is nice that they are open so late. I like being able to stroll in to a restaurant at 10 at night and not have to feel rushed through your meal cuz the place is closing. The menu has a lot to choose from so here are my findings: Miso Salmon - excellent! salmon is never overcooked and the flavors are wonderful, I order mash potatoes instead of rice Kobe Beef Burger - yummy! if you like mushroom, ask for extra mushroom as the burger does not ""come with"" too many on there Baked Potato soup - eh not such a fan, sent this one back Bang Bang Chicken - DO NOT ORDER THIS unless you are ok with receiving a plate of food that is absolutely covered in dried coconut! Don't get me wrong I love coconut but in moderation. Mini Pizzettes: love the margerita and the mushroom one, portion is perfect, crust has great flavor and are not smothered in cheese. I like my pizza with only a little cheese so that I can still taste the crust Small Plate Stuffed Mushrooms: these are good every once in a while, the sauce is a little sweet for me sometimes Eggs Blackstone: sooooo good. This is on the Sunday Brunch menu, it is basically eggs benedict but with poached egg, mushrooms, bacon, spinach and hollandaise on english muffin.  Beware of other items on the breakfast menu - Ordered a couple of other breakfast omelette items and they were both terrible!! Fried Calamari: This is the best I have had yet! the breading is seasoned well and the calamari is moist and not rubbery Favorite Cheescakes: Banana and Tirimissu Drink: I always order the passion iced tea, it has great flavor and doesnt even really need sugar =) One last thing - ALWAYS ASK FOR A BOOTH, trust me it is worth the extra five minute wait. Tables are placed so closed together that if you are an average size person, you need to turn sideways  just to sit down (I'm so not kidding...) and its impossible to have a conversation without the people sitting next to you hearing everything you say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1160

He had a good sense of humor and the dinner experience was never made uncomfortable. My burger was the last item to come to the table and he told me, ""It is called the Tons of Fun Burger because for your friends it is a ton of fun to see how you manage to eat it.""  The burger itself was pretty good, it didn't blow away the competition or anything. What made the experience great was definitely the service and the people I enjoyed my meal with.

We came at 10:00 and still had to wait 20 min to be seated.   Other than that, the food is always pretty good.  My boyfriend and I usually get a fatty appetizer and a salad and share, and there are still usually leftovers since the servings are so large.  This past time we went we had calamari, the factory chopped salad, and the thai chicken lettuce wraps.  Calamari was really good!  I like both the dipping sauces and the calamari was not overly breaded and fried like it can be at many places.  The thai chicken wraps are also really good - and they're great if you're trying not to eat carbs.  The chopped salad was okay.  I'm a huge salad person (that's what I usually get for my entree) and this one wasn't spectacular, but wasn't horrible either.  I think the best part was the apple bits mixed in which add a little extra tang/sweetness to the salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1200

Took a friend here for her b-day. For 2, not too long of a wait for a Saturday night - 35 mins (yes I consider this short since I have been told up to 3-4 hours a few times) For dinner my friend had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - good vegetarian pasta with all the what I call must have pasta goodies including broccoli, artichoke, basil, garlic and pine nuts. She took the leftovers home and her kids gobbled it all up! Must have been good if kids approve! I had the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Yummy! I do not normally order shrimp dishes, but my friend wanted to try it. Good shrimp (and amount of shrimp), and more good pasta goodies - mushrooms, arugula (nice touch) and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce. For drinks, my friend had the Strawberry Lemonade - good and not too tart or sweet. I had the Frozen Iced Mango - reminds me of the one raspberry swirl drink from the Elephant Bar. Yum! Onto the good stuff: dessert! My friend was thinking we order one cheesecake and share... sha! As if! I ordered 3 desserts for the 2 of us! That's what to-go boxes were made for! Greedy people like me! ; ) Chocolate Oreo Mudslide Cheesecake - not bad, could have been better. No distinct flavors came out of it... The 30th ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE was awesome! Very simple - layers of original cheesecake and chocolate fudge cake with chocolate cream. Sooo good! And to change it up from all the chocolate, I got the dessert I tried and liked the last time I was here: The Lemoncello Cream Torte. Yum! I will be back! =D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1200

Compared to all the over priced restaurants across the street at santana row, cheesecake factory is much better alternative especially for your wallet. However, i am not super impressed with the cheesecake, they put too much whip cream on it and its too sweet.  Its called cheesecake factory, its suppose to have awesome cheesecake!

batu b.,"San Jose, CA",0,32,,1.0,7/16/2008,"My wife and I went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner tonight.  We had a $50 gift card, so it was an excellent chance to immerse ourselves in a culture that we weren't really familiar with. Simply put, the Cheesecake Factory is Not Good.  It's all sugar and fat and salt and pepper.  The Steak Diane basically tasted the same as the Shrimp Scampi.  It's amazing - one was dark red color, the other pale color, one from land, one from sea, but they all sort of blended together into one sweet, salty flavor.  I think there is a corporate directive to never use the term ""bitter"" lest that sensation enter into the food and provide a modicum of balance.  The Gin rickey tasted like something from 7-11.  Ditto on the pineapple pisco sour.  Props for having pisco at the bar, drops for it being reduced to a condiment for a fruit punch. Speaking of condiment, it may be that the quality reference for everything is ketchup. For example, our Ahi Tuna Carpaccio was some thin slices of ahi tuna, drenched in some sort of Thousand Island dressing (without the relish bits), served on a square plate to help enhance the Asian influence. I'm guessing the fish was too dark a red, so they had to lighten up the color towards the ketchup ""normal,"" adding this sweet, mayonaissey substance to correct it. Also speaking of condiment, one of the burgers (we did not order this) offers steak AND bacon as a topping.   Not just meat-on-meat, but meat-on-meat-on-meat.   The interior is like some mid-range vegas strip encounter.  Smooth Jazz piped in from the high ceiling.  Full page glossy advertisements populated many pages throughout the expansive menu. Besides the letter ""e"", the most common characters were ""®"" and ""™"", indicating the proprietary names of their menu items or the trademarks of the brands incorporated into an offering (such as ""Snickers™ Delight Cheesecake""). More than a dining experience, the CCF offers a parody of America, with it's diverse clientele, profit-at-every-opportunity (ads in the menu??), and ethnic-influenced menu that takes a variety of flavors and makes them all the same.

It's tough to rate because I'm not sure what the Cheesecake factory is supposed to be... It's ""formal"" in design, but the food reminds me of Hometown Buffet (fried mac n cheese, spaghetti, bad lemonade). The only thing that saves this place is the fact that they have amazing desserts. Pumpkin, Macadamia, Cookie Dough and regular cheesecake flavors are my favs. And, cheesecake is the place my old cheer friends and I go when we meet up while college is out (Motions All Star National Champions!!!), so it's kinda sentimental. If you can find a different place to go, go there... oh, and the service is HORRIBLE. I've gone prob like 12+ times, and not once have I had better than mediocre service.

T Y.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,2,1.0,11/19/2011,"Really disappointed with the GM of this Cheesecake Factory. Took my mom for a celebration dinner, and we were having a great time, but unfortunately for us a waiter tripped and pasta sauce went flying over mom. She felt a shower of cold sauce on her neck and hair, and had spots of the red! sauce on her wool coat (which was draped over her chair) as well as on her shirt and jeans. The waiter did apologize, and we know mistakes happen. Our waiter offered us a dry cleaning, and the manager came over and apologized and told us to come back with the dry cleaning bill for them to cover, which we accepted. We left right away as my mom needed a shower ASAP, got our barely eaten food to go,paid for our dinner and tipped generously, of course, as it was not our waiter's fault. However, it was embarrassing for my mother because we noticed the couple sitting next to us could not contain their laughing at the spilling of spaghetti sauce over my mom.To the couple: I don't see what is so funny about it, but thank you for your insensitivity. Needless to say it wasn't a very enjoyable night at the Cheesecake Factory Went to the dry cleaners and the owner stated he ""wasn't sure the stains would come out"", and was pretty sure the ""smell would not come out"". He said there was a way to get it out, but it would cause the jacket to shrink too much, which may make it too tight to wear. He also said in his experience, the restaurants were supposed to reimburse you with cash for the dry cleaning immediately, and was surprised this establishment did not do so. He said that what he has seen with his customers in some incidents were that restaurants conveniently had a ""short memory"" when it came to accidents like this, and would not reimburse if they did not recall such an incident. But we didn't know that, and of course, it wouldn't occur to us to demand cash on the spot, nor would it look very good on our part. The dry cleaners said he would do his best to clean it though. The jacket is not Chanel or anything I admit, but I got it for her for her birthday, so you can see why we were concerned. Anyway, my mom called the General Manager, who was rude. Said if the dry cleaning place ""claimed"" it could not be fixed that we can bring it over to him and they will clean it.  Acted like we were trying to get money out of it and that he was doing us a favor already by offering to dry clean.  Personally I think that is an expectation, not a favor. She tried to explain accidents happened, not here to report anybody (didn't even have the waiter's name) but was just concerned about what would happen if the dry cleaning could not remove the large stains of spaghetti sauce over her clothes. He did not want to listen, never once said he was sorry and acted too busy to attend to the mistakes of his staff. Really disappointed with the handling of this experience. An apology would have sufficed. Would reconsider eating here again and also want to tell my friends that they will not take responsibility if the waiters spill food on you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1480
Florence W.,"Fremont, CA",122,281,27,4.0,6/5/2009,"This is like an other Cheesecake Factory, but one event made this particular location stand out. My friend and I finally got seated after a long day of spending way too much money. The wait here is always long-ish, so be prepared for that. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, which is really awesome. The food arrived and we started to dig in. After a few bites, I noticed a short straight hair on the other side of my pasta (the side I wasn't eating form, Thank God. I paused and had to ask myself what type of hair I had (long and wavy--not mine. EEK!). My friends and I were, needless to say, super grossed out. I flagged down the first server I saw and told her and she took it away. A minute later a manager came by and apologized for the incident and assured me it was an isolated event, which I did believe them. She asked if I wanted to order the same thing or something else, which I ended up choosing the Pasta Da Vinci. She offered me a soup or salad while I waited and I declined (I'm already eating carbs, do i need any more food in my belly?). It was a nice gesture, however and I did appreciate it. My original server came by and apologized for the incident as well, even though it was not her fault. Ten minutes later, another manager brought out my food and apologized. I really appreciated everyone's efforts and they handled the situation well. By the time the server brought our bill, she had taken off my pasta. It was extremely nice of her to do so, and I was prepared and expecting to pay for my meal, since everything turned out fine. She did not have to do so, but she insisted, so she got one big fat tip from us. The managers and the servers were extremely nice and remorseful about the incident, and I would definitely come back again.  Final Verdict: Despite the long wait, you should still come here. I found a hair in my food, which is my friend's biggest fear!

Got to our booth , got the specials spiel, ordered our drinks asked for a few minutes to decide and....waited.  Ten minuted later we were able to order our spicy beef and Shepperd's pie and again...... waited.  Another ten minutes and another waiter arrived to ask if we wanted bread and water, brought just the bread and retook our order this time with additional soup and salad. These arrived promptly and the soup was great.  25 minutes later the remainder of our meal arrived.  Upon my asking why the delay, was told the computer system had lost our order.  Well, having done a stint as a waiter in a previous life, it looked and tasted like our deep fried crispy spicy beef has sat around for way too long under the heat lamps.  Like old shriveled french fries that you reheat in the micro just 'cause you're hungry.  The Shepard's Pie as the previous reviewer noted was just plain flavorless with raw julienned carrots that needed to be bite sized added as an afterthought.  The inaccurate bill arrived, I paid with the appropriate tip added and left the brightly lit overly staffed restaurant  feeling quite disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1600

Well, not in this case.  I didn't even get a piece of cheesecake!  Fast forward to 2008 and I get an invite to lunch for one of my co-worker's birthday.  I order the cobb salad.  So good!  The lunch portion was a huge serving even though it was a half serving of the original size.  I also ordered a slice of the tiramisu cheesecake, which was very delicious! Had to take the rest to go, since it was so rich.  Ate the other half during my work break.  Overall, the factory is not really a place I'd go out of my way to eat at.  It's just okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1600

They called our name/buzzer, and we went to get sat - only to find out that they had sat a party of 4 in this area.  10 minutes later, they tried to sit us at a booth that only seats 5!!!!  20 minutes after that, they finally seated us.  They did provide us with free appetizers, but my brother-in-law did ask if we were going to get something comped for our troubles.  They took our drink order right away- and we told them we were ready to order.  The waitress said she would come back and take it in a minute.  No big deal - except she didn't come back to take our order or to bring our drinks for at least 20 minutes - well after we had finished our appetizers.  The food took forever to arrive, meanwhile we had a waitress swap out - while ours went on break, and we had to ask the manager to check on our food.  The food arrived and some of my family felt like it was cold.  By the end of the night - we had been there for over 3 hours, 2 hours at the table, and my husband had already had to leave early to put our daughter to bed!  We ask for the check, provide a card - and she disappears for what seems like another 20 minutes!  They still charged us the 20% gratuity for large parties.  Total lack of class.  Learn from our mistake - and try another Cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1640

We only order for 10 people and they consistently disappoint us. If we call and ask what happened, we are treated like garbage and if we complain it's as if we criticized their first born.

It is not helpful in a customer service environment when the serving staff projects their frustrations and feeling of being overwhelmed onto the guest of that establishment.  I'll chalk that up to a lack of training and lack of employees.  Needless to say, where they lack in people skills they make up with my salmon. The menu is overwhelming and can confuse a straving person with the various choices.

Bori G.,"San Jose, United States",228,21,1,5.0,21/11/2015,"THE PASTA IS SO GOOD I WANNA THROW UP AND EAT IT AGAIN! Specifically the Louisiana Chicken Pasta dish. I forgot who, but a friend or acquaintance recommended it to me year and years ago and I've been getting it ever since. It's got a nice hint of spice and the chicken that it comes with is lightly breaded, so your taste buds do not get clogged with all of that flavor stealing breading thievery.  Before that I would get the Chicken Littles which come with mashed potatoes and corn and I remember that being lovely as well.  I'm always way too full for cheesecake because the dishes are the size of 49 Volkswagen Beetles, but I have had a few of them in my lifetime and they were DELICIOUS.  Oh and that FREE BROWN BREAD they serve you while you wait for your meal is extremely tasty. They run out sometimes on the weekends though, so if they don't have it tell them BORIS said ""you already know you are gonna run out so MAKE MORE... NOW!""

When my dish arrived, it looked amazing! There were tons of delicious veggies in my dish! They put broccoli, thinly sliced carrots, and mushrooms. It tasted divine and had the right amount of alfredo without it being overly salty or rich. I think this has to be the best fettuccine alfredo I've ever eaten! Yum!  For dessert, we ordered the strawberry cheesecake and the oreo cookie cheesecake. The strawberry one was great, but the oreo cookie one was a little too rich for my palette. Perfect for kids though!

I love their cheesecakes especially the smore's one - I forgot the exact name of the cheesecake but the chocolate was super decadent and rich! Their dinner portion is a bit too big but I usually just have it as leftover for my lunch at work if I'm lazy to grab food or make my own lunch and plus, I gotta get my moneys worth for my big portion left over, right? The wait here will have to vary because of course if you come on a Friday-Weekend night, the wait will always be long since everyone is on their dinner dates and someone will always have a big party for their birthday celebrations.

My family ordered: The Calamari appetizer - just like any calamari appetizer you will get Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - Didn't really eat too much of this one Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo - Wouldn't recommend, I've had better Gumbo & the rice was hard Louisiana Chicken Pasta - Always a Good choice of pasta Steak Diane - It was good. I know on the menu it says it has black peppercorn on it but it was too much pepper for me And for Dessert: Red Velvet Cheesecake - Delicious!  Reese's® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - Too rich, thick, and made me want to drink water after every bite; definitely on the lower end of my list of cheesecake choices. I've been to Cheesecake several times and have ordered other dishes as well - Overall a very consistent restaurant.

I totally understand that this is a very popular place and it does get busy. It took more time to receive our food than it took to get a table. Our waitress was just horrible. I will not name her because that is very embarrassing. She was more attentive with the table besides us and doing who knows what. When she would check on us she walked away so quick we'd still be taking to her and would have the audacity to leave in mid sentence while we were talking.  The food oh my. HORRIBLE. My fiancé had the fettuccini Alfredo pasta. We drove nearly two hours for it because that is the only pasta he likes and for it be uncooked and hard was just disappointing. By the time we even saw our waitress it was just too late to say anything about the food. I had the pasta de Vinci and that was uncooked too. This restaurant is a very well known place. Multibillion corporation, you'd think they'd give they're chefs some cooking lessons. Uncooked pasta can make one very sick. Food and service was horrible. Took us nearly an hour just to get the check and another hour just so she can pick up the check. It died down around 8:30 and we were still receiving bad service. Hope you guys retrain the servers.

Thursday night I took my granddaughter to The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate her birthday during her week long visit from her home in Florida.  She loves The Cheesecake Factory so we didn't mind waiting for a table.  My granddaughter loves fish but does not care for salmon.  The waitress told her that they had swordfish with a lemon caper sauce (which just happens to be my granddaughter's favorite fish!); so of course that's what she ordered.  When the plate was delivered it was SALMON.  The waitress said she'd have her order fixed. By the time her plate was delivered my meal was cold and my hungry granddaughter had filled up on bread.

Julius W.,"Oakland, United States",46,4,3,1.0,25/3/2017,"I'll start by saying, I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory, but today's experience was UNACCEPTABLE and borderline insulting! My wife and I were heading home to the East Bay, but decided to stop at this location to grab dinner on our way home. We walked in and were IMMEDIATELY seated in the back right next to the restrooms, even though we walked past an ENTIRE open section in the front where NO ONE was seated. (We continued to watch as customers of color continued to be led to the back of the restaurant.) Why is that? After ordering apps, it took over 20 minutes for my app to arrive. (My app was an order of spring rolls). Why did it take 20 minutes for it to come out? Then, it took a while longer before our food came out. Our waitress kept telling us, ""It's on the way"", but I assume it was just words as nothing came out. Once our food finally arrived, my food was good, but my wife's order was WRONG! She ordered grilled fish tacos, but fried fish tacos came out instead. Again, the waitress told us, ""We'll fix it right away and bring it out to you."" 20 minutes passed by and NO TACOS. My wife went to get the manager and we explained to him what happened. He gave a half apology, but offered nothing for our inconvenience and lack of quality service. I used to work in a restaurant and when I messed up, I offered a comp. bill, dessert, a sincere apology, and I made sure to follow up with the customer. Guess what??! Those customers always came back and I treated them like VIP customers when they came in. The manager here seemed to not really care about our dinner experience. If that's the case, let me know and I'll get up and walk out. The staff today did not meet our expectations in any way and because of that, we will NEVER eat at this location again. To me, it seems like customers of color aren't valued. I hope I'm wrong, but as I tell my kindergarten students, ""Your actions always speak louder than words."" Before driving back home, my wife and I stopped by Pleasant Hill and grabbed her an EXCELLENT burger from Moana's. Thanks to them, she had an enjoyable meal! If you're thinking about eating at this location, please read the reviews first. If I did, it would have saved us a lot of trouble!

Jan E.,"San Jose, United States",181,271,980,4.0,11/9/2013,"This is a great place to take someone on a date because it's fancy and the menu has a million things to choose from. We usually get 3 appetizers to share and each get our own main dish. We even get a cheesecake to wash everything down. I like the strawberry lemonade and that has unlimited refills. We've never had a problem with the service. They are pretty good about bringing your food out and refilling your water. There's so much to choose on the menu. We like trying new things. Everything is pretty good. There's room for improvement for some of the food though. For example, I ordered the spring summer rolls and the wrap was all broken. They did not know how to wrap a Vietnamese spring roll lol. The crab cheese wonton is also good. The lobster and artichoke dip is good. Ahhhh my mouth is watering as I'm listing some of their yummy food. My hubby liked the pork chop but to me it was kinda dry but that's just me. I liked the hibachi steak but he did not like it. I remember not liking the club sandwich either. Overall everything is pretty good. They also give you bread and butter while you wait for your food so that's cool if you are hella hungry. Our bill is usually $100 because we don't eat here often and like to go all out. I still say its a good date place but if you're cheap then go eat at the food court lol. One con is that our snicker cheesecake was old one time. You can taste the old ness. $7.50 for an old slice of cheesecake is a no no. You would expect fresh cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory right?? But nope they gave us an old one that was at least a few days old.

To start off the restaurant wasn't super busy but had a 15-20 minute wait which wasn't horrible. The waitress my girlfriend and I had was friendly but was not attentive to anything we said. We order drinks, an appetizer, and a main course. The appetizer never came. The drinks came when our food came after waiting 40-45 minutes and after reminded her twice about the drinks. My drink was at least 75% ice and tasting flat. We then ordered one slice of cheesecake thinking it would only take a few minutes for one slice of cheesecake to travel from the front of the restaurant to our table, nope. Almost 15 minutes of waiting. And that point we were both pretty fed up and paid the bill. I will be returning to talk to the manger because the service was unbearable.

Was waiting for a while, but it was pretty packed, so I gave them some more time. After 15 minutes of waiting, I called and let them know that I'm about to leave.

Xin W.,"San Francisco, United States",294,111,234,4.0,24/4/2015,"So I'm always on this endless pursuit in finding the best cheesecake. There are various qualities that I look at: the texture (and how smooth it is), the softness/fluffiness of it (it should melt in your mouth), the balance of sweetness and tanginess, the levels of acidity (very important in a rich dish like the cheesecake), the crust (not too thick and not too thin) and how crunchy it is, the flavors, the presentation, and the freshness (especially when there are fruit toppings). The secret is to bake the cheesecake low and slow to prevent it from cracking, to prevent the sides from rising and the center from sinking, and to result in a light, moussey texture. However unless you're Gordon Ramsay or on Masterchef, it usually take 5+ hours to bake the perfect cheesecake. Cheesecake Factory add synthetic binders, like guar gum and xanthan gum, to their batter to allow it to be baked faster while still holding it together. While the cheesecake here is definitely not the best I've tasted, it tastes pretty good. My favorite is the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. Nice bite of acidity, good balance of sweetness and tanginess, thin crunchy crust with an airy-looking texture. All of the other cheesecake I've eaten here are either too sweet or too rich.  For the entrees, I really love the Steak Diane. Very flavorful, very tasty, and the steak is cooked to perfection, very juicy. The shrimp scampi is also great! Although I wish they would put in more shrimps. I'm not quite a fan of their pasta, it's very buttery and very rich.  Ambience is cozy, although it can get busy at times.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=440

However, they did get us seated immediately after realizing their error, but took a while to get seated once they call you up with your pager.

I came here recently for my friend's birthday dinner.  I don't think we waited that long to be seated.  I was the only one who didn't order steak, but I also didn't want to spend so much money on steak even though I was kind of craving it.  Two of my friends ordered Filet Mignon ($31.95), one ordered Hibachi Steak ($19.95), and I ordered Four Cheese Pasta ($12.95).    After the waitress took our order, we did nothing but wait.  Sure the bread came out but after that the wait was so long.  It almost felt as bad as my experience at the Old Spaghetti Factory in terms of waiting.  I remember the last time before my most recent visit was also slow. Our food FINALLY came and we started to eat.  I tried a piece of my friend's Filet Mignon and a piece of my other friend's Hibachi Steak.  The Hibachi Steak tasted pretty good and I liked the flavor.  The Filet Mignon was also pretty good.  My Four Cheese Pasta was alright but I would have liked more chicken in mine. All said and done, this Cheesecake Factory location has very slow service.  If you don't mind waiting a long time then come here. 2.5 stars.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=600
Kristine F.,"Hayward, United States",448,567,3762,5.0,18/12/2012,"The Chicken Bellagio is soooo good!!!! Perfectly soft yet crisp outside pan fried chicken breast finished with prosciutto and arugula sitting atop al dente pesto pasta with just the right amount of yummy white cream sauce mmmm don't be afraid to overload it with Parmesan cheese either. Mmmm makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Definitely go for the Shepard's Pie if you want something filling and buttery tasting! Tender and flavorful chunks of ground beef sautéed with peas, slivered carrots & cucumbers, onions, mushrooms! crowned with a hefty portion of their to die for buttery mashed potato goodness! You know something is good if you savor the flavor even when completely full. Their mashed potatoes hit the spot every time! Expect leftovers to take home unless you're sharing this dish.  The shrimp bistro pasta is worth a shot too-- lightly breaded and fried shrimp on a bed of pasta with lemon cream sauce and now that I think of it-- capers! I love those! The macaroni and cheese burger is ok. Their Caesar salad is good! Cheesecakes I've tried & recommend: -Red velvet: smooth and delish! Plenty of white chocolate curls on the edge, moist red velvet cake alternating layers with their smooth original cheesecake -Oreo dream extreme: my new favorite! Traditional Oreo crust beneath a mound of yummy cheesecake filled with whole Oreo cookies! It's more complicated than that but just take a look at a picture =] top it all off with chocolate cream icing and whipped cream -Snickers: a must try if you love chocolate bars! Each bite is filled with creamy cheesecake and chunks of caramel, peanuts, nougat, and of course chocolate!  -Adam's peanut butter fudge ripple: the favorite of one of my best friend's (she's in love with peanut butter) peanut butter cups, fudge, chocolate, nuts, peanut butter topping that's seriously too sweet but this cheesecake has got it going on!   I've also tried the one with macadamias/caramel/white chocolate and the caramel pecan turtle-- they're alright. I'm not a big fan of caramel IN my desserts. Maybe on it is fine.  -Chocolate chip cookie dough: simple and sweet, reminds me of the days we ate cookie dough straight from the package, or was that last week ... One waiter I must compliment is Jesse J. He strives to be the best without even breaking a sweat-- it's all natural to him. My friend and I had him twice, and good thing we did because the first time he took over for another waiter that really shouldn't have been working when it was obvious he didn't care much for the customers. Jesse was the relief we needed after our past server was seen in the back chatting with fellow workers when I needed to follow up on my order when it was his fault in the first place for not getting it right (I had asked the waiter for a macaroni and cheese burger and then he asks me what kind of burger I wanted?? I thought he meant there were choices in patty so I said I didn't know and he wrote down classic. Umm hello?! Mac & cheese please! Plus I said I wanted the Caesar salad instead of fries and he asks ""with fries?"" DUDE! What planet are you living on?!?!) Enough with the nameless waiter I didn't bother getting the name of!   Jesse goes above and beyond! He always anticipates our needs right before we ask! Our waters were consistently filled, we were given more bread without complaints, he asked about boxes for leftovers, and didn't even ask for the 50% cheesecake Facebook print out a few months ago-- he just glanced at them AND knew which cheesecakes to deduct from (ordered cheesecake to go also). Some servers use the discount on the cheapest item on the bill but ours didn't and I'm happy for that. Businesses should have more employees like this-- we're sure to come back because of people like him.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=600

As we were walked to our table there were several dirty yet empty tables. We were seated (she was pleasant and gave us a choice of table which I appreciated).  The flatware was dirty.  We then had 10 minutes to look over the menu and then waited. I grabbed a server walking by to ask if our server could come over. She came over, took our order... She returned shortly with our drinks and only white bread, no wheat, she said they were out.  The food came quickly and it was delicious. The food was why I didn't leave one star. There was no follow up about the meal, she cleared once we were done and brought the check. It was 2pm so we had a late lunch.

Medi C.,"Sunnyvale, United States",0,3,,2.0,5/10/2016,"I'm only leaving two stars for this particular location.  Cheesecake Factory in general has an expansive and pretty tasty menu.  But this location suffers with execution and the manager seems ineffective.  I think he is fairly young and may not be up to the task of running this place well.  I have spoken to him multiple times and he seemed nice enough but ultimately lied to me about compensation for multiple screwed up takeout orders - said he sent me a gift card as an apology. That was four weeks ago (I assumed it would come in 1-2 days) and still no card. And even getting him to make that gesture in the first place was like pulling teeth.  I have had Eureka in Cupertino or Town in San Carlos make mistakes and they do not hesitate to make it right. And I have been back to those restaurants again and again and again.  Restaurant Managing 101 isn't it? If you make a mistake, take responsibility and keep your customers. Responding to Yelp reviews and making empty promises about improved service next time is NOT taking responsibility for your screwups.  I'd call it ""for show"" damage control.

Salman H.,"San Mateo, United States",15,98,86,3.0,2/2/2015,"I was extremely extremely disappointed to find out( after several visits) that all their cheesecakes have beef gelatin which we can't eat due to religious restrictions. I feel TCF should mention the gelatin somewhere since we had no idea. we had to ask the server who had no idea either and had to ask the head chef.  The place is quite busy at night so be prepared to wait. the service is not amazing. besides the sad gelatin part which means I will never be able to eat at TCF again, their cheesecakes are usually spot on.  I have always loved their Linda's fudge cake. This big slab of chocolate fudge cake.mmm.. at 9$ a slice its a bit on the expensive side but tastes awesome!  I have also tried their snickers, Oreo, Hershey's, n Reese's cheesecakes which all tasted delicious.  The not so great ones were the key lime pie, white chocolate raspberry, and dutch apple caramel streusel. These ones were sub par especially the apple caramel streusel.

SK L.,"Folsom, United States",9,160,,2.0,31/7/2014,"I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake factory!  However, I can't think of a time where I was disappointed this much.  This was the first time that I came to this branch.  I went for dinner, and it was not a big surprise that there was a wait, which I don't mind because their good food was worth it.   The workers seating us were really nice and professional.  Our waiter was excellent!   However, I timed the length of time to get my food and it took 28 minutes to get my favorite entree, the jambalaya pasta.  I could tell that our waiter had no control bringing the food over quicker.  He was very kind and let us know it was coming.  He came by our table multiple times, so that made our experience tolerable.  When I finally received my food, the noodles were all stuck together, over cooked, and mushy.  The chicken was over cooked, as it was really tough.  The shrimp was cooked ok.  I probably ate about 1/4 of it just because I was so hungry, and then I couldn't take it anymore and just asked for a box just to look kind to the waiter.  If the food is going to come out that late, I better get food cooked properly. The food also came out so late that we didn't even have time to have one of our most favorite desserts, their oreo cheesecake.  The kids were already going to go nuts because of being there so long and we had to leave.       If food is coming out this late, I at least expect a manager, especially from a popular restaurant like this one to warn us about really slow service or giving a little extra to make the dining experience outstanding, which is what I'm sure the corporate expects from each restaurant.  I wanted to complain so much to the waiter, but because I knew it was beyond his control about the food being brought in quicker and the food being cooked properly, I just let it be.  This should be a 1 star rating but I put it at 2 because of the excellent service by our waiter.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=560

I had the Peach Smoothie that was large enough to share between two and it was garnished with a pineapple wedge and strawberry. The waiter started us off with sourdough and honey wheat bread along with butter. We decided to go family style on the appetizers we had;  Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls Crispy Crab Wontons  Fried Mac N Cheese I decided to have the lunch Cobb Salad, which is still a large portion if I may add. I thought the Smoothie was delicious, refreshing and I appreciated the use of ripe fruit as garnish. The appetizers were good, the summer rolls are TCF's take on Vietnamese Spring Rolls and were edible even for my dad who is picky about places that try to recreate his homeland's food. The Crispy Crab Wontons were incredibly filling and dense with crab meat these have a spicy bite! And the Fried Mac N Cheese was just plain delicious fried to perfection, gooey inside and sitting on a bed of creamy tomato sauce. My Cobb Salad was just that, it was kind of overwhelming and I wasn't found that as I chewed away at my salad there was slices of chicken hidden fork deep into my dish. I do love me some good ol' Bleu Cheese though. For dessert, Banana Cream and Red Velvet cheesecake to share amongst ourselves. It's called The Cheesecake Factory for a reason. These are by far my favorites! I don't know what kind of food this place serves, they have an extensive menu with all kinds of flavors like texmex, asian and american.

Luicidal S.,"San Jose, United States",392,17,14,1.0,10/7/2015,"My coworkers and I come here almost once a week for lunch together during their ""Happy Hour."" It's a great place for us to connect on a weekly basis and we've had no problems in the past. This time was different. Four of us arrived in the bar and lounge area and business was understandably slow for a weekday. Regardless of slow business, our server took 15-20 minutes to even greet us. We then proceeded to order and asked simple questions about the menu and drink specials. She did not know any answers in regards to pricing or to what comes with certain items. The brainless server had to ask the bartender near by all our questions. She then returned and exclaimed to us that she ""hadn't worked a Happy Hour in over a year in a half.""  I knew then we were in for a fun lunch yet we proceed to enter our order. My coworker asked for a burger WITHOUT Thousand Island dressing, my other coworker asked for a small side of fries. Both of these orders were brought back incorrectly. The burger was smoothed in dressing, and we had a huge bowl of large fries in front of us. The server then decided to disappear for another 20 minutes and we were greeted with a new server and we were told he was ""taking over."" The first server wasn't off of work, she couldn't handle working with multiple tables and cowardly made her way towards the back. They attempted to correct our orders but that took another 20 minutes, by that time we had to go back to work. We asked to speak to a manager, perhaps they could comp one of our items or maybe just a simple apology. We received neither. Instead THE MANAGER GRACE, proceeded to argue back and forth with my coworker to the point of shouting. As a manager this type of behavior is unacceptable. She finally comped our burger which was 5 dollars by the way, and then took ONE DOLLAR off our incorrect fries order.  Never will we return to this location and we spread the word to the rest of our team as well. Sometimes people don't want things for free, people just want to be heard and acknowledged.

Xiao X.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,3,,1.0,6/6/2015,"I placed an to go order at this location and unfortunately they missed the cheesecake but charged for it - I did not realize I did not get the cake until the next day as I was planning to eat it the next day so I called the restaurant. After been put on hold for 10 mins the mgr interrogated me for 15 mins including asking me twice why I did not check the order on spot like that is the law. I ended the conversation as I felt like not wasting time on a piece of cheesecake. I used to love this restaurant but treating your customer like they want to scam you for a piece of cheesecake is not an intelligent way to grow business.  This happened on 6/6/15 and this mgr-on-duty really should improve her work ethics as well as intelligence. I mean after all she is in the service industry and it is her most basic job to treat customers in a respectful way, then second comes managing a restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=460

Liz W.,"Cupertino, United States",166,54,1,4.0,17/6/2015,"Their menu is so huge I'm often lost on what to eat here. But I think I finally found my favorite after many trial and error.  PRICE  - Their lunch special is fairly reasonably priced - ranging from $10-15 depending on what you pick. We had the pasta and the salad from the lunch special.  FOOD  - Their Louisiana Chicken is quite amazing for pasta! It has this right balance of cream with a bit of spice. So you can actually eat the whole plate without craving something spicy to balance the creaminess of the pasta. Also, I really liked the way the chicken was fried! The batter was crisp and the chicken was moist. Very delicious dish. 4.5/5.  - Their Luau salad was really good. I love the combination of fruits and vegetables. I did wish that the mango was a bit more ripe to bring out its sweetness. The presentation was also very pretty - with all these colorful bell pepper slices & mangoes in the midst of all the green. However, the chicken was very very dry. 3.5/5.  - Their cheesecake is excellent - honestly, I've had a lot of different types and I haven't been disappointed in any of them. I didn't get any this time around because I was stuffed, but I was very very tempted to. haha.  SERVICE - I know she had a lot of people to serve, but she was still so accommodating and nice. I love how she left a little handwritten ""thank you"" on the bill. :].  MISC  - Also, I found it interesting that their lunch special lasts all the way to 5pm! In most restaurants I've been to, lunch specials usually end around 3pm or so.  - I always found cheesecake factory a bit cold. So bring a jacket!  - One thing to note is that, we asked for the salad dressing to be on the side, and we did get the dressing on the side, but the salad still came seasoned with some sort of a sweeter dressing. I wasn't sure if that was a mistake or if the salad is pre-mixed.. but the dressing that was already on the salad and the dressing on the side that it came with had very very different flavors (the dressing on the side has more lemon, vinegar and sour taste to it). - you will always wait here. I've been to this restaurant multiple times and I've never just been able to walk in and eat hahaha. I came today on a weekday around 3pm and I still had to wait a couple minutes (literally no more than 5-10 minutes, but nevertheless, a wait). I'm not complaining about the wait at all, but just know that you do. especially for a bigger party than 2.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=460
Karen M.,"San Jose, United States",6,84,857,2.0,19/2/2016,"I believe the customer service could be better. I arrived a few minutes before opening at 11AM. The day was bitter cold and windy in Santa Clara and there were several women huddled at both the locked doors. Inside, one could see the manager and several workers standing around talking and laughing; they could see us standing there in the wind. I feel that management could have at least let us into the lobby area; but no, we were freezing out there with our noses pressed against the windows. I ordered the Pit Beef Dip sandwich. The flavor was fine, it was the beef that was tough and extremely fatty; literally, there were huge chunks of fat throughout the beef. After removing as much fat as I could, I was just about left with a cheese and grilled onion sandwich. I know there are a lot of people who enjoy fatty meat, but it isn't my cup of tea. The Wait Service can use some attention. Our server seemed to disappear all the time; had to constantly look around for her to get her attention.

It was obvious she was super busy, and couldn't help the food time. For a Sunday night, it was busy, and there were obviously too few servers.

She said they did and brought out a dessert towards the end of our meal. It was just a shot glass full of whipped cream. Just whipped cream! There was nothing else in it. Seriously? Cheesecake factory couldn't afford to give even a tiny piece of dessert in that tiny shot glass? If it was free, then I would've just been mildly annoyed. But after we left, my friend told me that they charged us $9 for that shot of whipped cream -____- Besides that issue, the rest of the experience was okay. The wait for a table was pretty long since we had a large group. Service was average. I ordered the Miso Salmon with brown rice since the birthday girl recommended it. It was definitely tasty but I'm not sure if it was worth the price.

Andrea W.,"Fremont, United States",149,1829,990,3.0,19/7/2015,"I came here with a group of 8 around 6PM on a weekend, and we waited for about 30-40 minutes for a table. We were seated in a booth and promptly served menus and water, as well as drinks. There's complimentary sourdough bread and brown? bread (I'm not entirely sure what it was, maybe oat bread? My friends said it was somewhat sweet though), and the bread was very fresh and soft. The waiter was pretty good about coming over to see whether we were ready to order and to refill our water, as well as coming back to ask how our food was during the meal and clearing our plates afterward. I ordered a cajun jambalaya pasta, and it was alright. There was a LOT of pasta (there was green pasta as well as the usual white pasta), and the chicken was pretty tender. The shrimp wasn't very fresh though, and there seemed to be a lack of sauce. There was somehow a lot of oil though. The sauce wasn't very spicy, and I think there could have been more toppings to balance out the amount of pasta in the dish. Either that, or there should have been less pasta. For the amount of food, the price is decent seeing that this is a higher-class restaurant - my pasta was around $18 pre-tax pre-tip. I also shared a strawberry cheesecake with my friends. The whipped cream is really good! Very thick and not overly sweet. Yum. Each cheesecake slice is around $8 pre-tax pre-tip, but I guess that's excusable seeing that this is Cheesecake Factory.

Or you can always opt for the bar area if seats are available.  Cheesecake Factory has got to be one of my fav places to eat at. Extensive menu!!! Their menu is basically a book! So much to choose from. It can be overwhelming for someone who's never eaten here before. But because I've eaten here so much, there's always those dishes I keep going back for!  Cocktails .. My favorites are the Ritz Martini and Ultimate margarita. Ritz martini basically has Courvoisier, Champagne, Cointreau and Pomegranate Juice. It's soooo good & strong! When I'm in the mood for tequila, can't go wrong with that ultimate margarita (stronger Version of their margarita?) I believe it's top shelf also.  Favorite Appetizers.. Avocado egg rolls, Mac and cheese balls, ahi tuna tartare ( wish they gave you a bigger portion though!) Entrees... Louisiana chicken pasta and pasta da Vinci are to die for! So flavorful. Pasta da Vinci is a bit on the sweeter side because of the Marsala sauce. The sauce for the Louisiana chicken pasta is a Cajun style spicy. When I'm in the healthy mood, I opt for the ahi tuna tatake salad. The ahi tuna is perfection. The best ahi tuna salad compared to other places I've tried.  And lastly... Cheesecake!! at this point I'm usually already super full, but either get the cheesecake to go or continue to stuff my face. Can't go wrong with the tiramisu or red velvet cheesecake. My two fav!

Susan K.,"West Covina, United States",149,7,4,1.0,19/5/2015,"Why does anyone ever go here ever? (Extra ever added for emphasis.) Our mistake was going to the Cheesecake Factory.  First of all, we waited forever to get water. We did not have bread on the table for over 30 mins and we were ordering appetizers before anything else came.  Food was average. Nonetheless we waited and we ate, but it was the worst experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. We asked for a refill on our drinks not 1 but 4 times. Not exaggerating at all. After the 3rd time the waiter grabbed our cups for the refills but never came back with the drink until we asked for the 4th time. I really believe our waiter was drinking on the job. To top it off when we were getting ready to pay their computers crashed and we had to wait for the system to go up. HORRIBLE. The tables next to us were all running out of patience for service.  The Cheesecake Factory has been steadily going down hill for years now, but tonight reached an all time low as far as my experiences go.  I'd never ever give this place another dime.

I generally try to avoid Santana Row and its surrounding areas like  the plague (One can only take so much douchebaggery) but I do pop in here and partake of their curbside delivery and I always order the same thing; green salad with chicken and their stuffed mushrooms. Their salads are always fresh and of course the ranch dressing is scrumptious. The stuffed mushrooms are cheesy and buttery and just yummy.  All in all the curbside delivery is nice, but if you end up dropping in to order take-out be prepared to wait. They are slow as molasses when taking and preparing your order, it's very frustrating - Especially when I've been standing at the damn counter forever waiting to place my order and the cheesecake lady is there pretending to be busy while completely failing to acknowledge my existence or taking a second to call someone that can actually help.

Nancy T.,"Morrisville, United States",506,95,313,1.0,28/3/2014,"Let me start off by saying this was probably the most annoying dining experience I have ever had.  We came in Thursday night around 7. The wait was about 20 minutes, not bad at all.  We were seated and the host handed us the menus. We started looking for what we wanted and decided rather quickly. 15 minutes had gone by, and we didn't even know who our server was. 5 more minutes and the server stops by our table to say she will be right back.  She comes back and asks us what we want to order. I ordered some chicken avocado sandwich and I asked to switch out the French baguette for a soft roll. Our server says that she doesn't think they have that but the menu did. I asked her to let me know so I could change my order if needed.  We also had to ask for the water and bread because she did not bring it out for us. We ordered and the food came out about 20 minutes later.  My friend ordered the same thing as me but she didn't ask for the baguette to be switched out. Our server never got back to me about the bread so I also got the baguette. Another 5 minutes go by without her checking on us. I send the food back to have the bread changed about 20 minutes after we get our food because that's when our server checked on us (finally) and it comes back 10 minutes later with the same thing!!!  By this time, the rest of my party was done eating so I didn't even want to deal with it being sent back again to be changed. I asked for the order to be cancelled with another server because ours was no where to be found. The manager was very understanding and cancelled the order right away.

Amy D.,"Fremont, United States",474,2309,5375,3.0,26/3/2014,"This review is just for the 2 cheesecake flavors I tried that we got to go. We went in on a weekday to pick up two slices of cheesecake, and tried: -Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake (Chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups in our Original Cheesecake w/Layers of Delicious Fudge Cake and Caramel,  ): Pretty good, but it was really sweet. I liked some of the layers more than others, and wished they didn't have the two layers of super sweet caramel and huge chunks of peanuts. The original cheesecake and fudge cake layers were really good, as was the peanut butter frosting on top. Although I liked most of the cheesecake, I don't think I would order it again over my other favorites. -Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake (Layers of Rich Brownie, Kahlua Cheesecake, Creamy Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Ganache,  ): Just ok- the Kahlua and coffee flavors were too strong and a little bitter for my liking. Although I really liked the creaminess of this cheesecake, I wouldn't order this flavor again.

The last time we went, we were celebrating our marriage with family at the Union Square location in San Francisco. When we got here, we saw it was packed, but I knew that the wait would be long for bigger parties. Since it was just my husband and I, it only took 15 minutes for a table. And what's great was that it was just as the hostess said: 15 to 20 minute wait. Started off with a Blueberry Mojito for myself and Stella Artois for the hubby. Definitely get a Blueberry Mojito, always! They make it so yummy that I can't taste the alcohol and that can be dangerous for me because then I want more and I'll get drunk way faster than I can imagine. But that's a different story. I ordered the steak diane (medium rare) and herb crusted salmon combo which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. And I ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. My husband ordered the hibachi steak (medium rare) which also came with mashed potatoes and he ordered a side of corn succotash. SO GOOD! Everything we had was definitely up to par and my mouth is just watering just thinking about that salmon though. Lemon butter sauce? PERFECTION.

She made sure we were happy with our drinks and was consistent with her friendliness with everyone sitting at the bar, even this annoying group sitting next to us.

Anthony B.,"Denver, United States",4,8,,5.0,7/11/2014,"Let me preface this review by saying that myself and the people I dined at Cheesecake Factory with this evening all have years of server experience. Our server tonight was Daniel, who absolutely blew us away.  I can't say enough good things about this experience, seriously. The food was fantastic, (try the clam chowder).... as I am used to with Cheesecake Factory, but tonight Daniel and his service stepped up the game. I will now choose Valley Fair Cheesecake factory over Oakridge every time I choose to dine there.  It's like this guy (Daniel) appeared out of nowhere, refilling our drinks, checking up to see how we were, or just holding a friendly conversation while taking our order.  To top it all off, at the end of our meal, he brought us lemon scented hot towels... Where am I.... A spa? But seriously. Major points because my girlfriend and I had lettuce wraps so my hands were feeling it.  Overall five freakin stars. Will dine again, just to sit in Daniel's section. And I suggest you should, too.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=520

Cost: Pretty pricey for what we ended up getting at this location. Taste: It plain out sucked. We ordered an appetizer and entree. The stuffed mushrooms were nothing special and drenched in a copious amount of oil. The garlic noodles were crunchy and stuck together. Yes, they were horribly undercooked and disgustingly also drenched in oil. These chefs do not do it right. Please do not order their food.  Customer Service: Not applicable since I ordered take out.

She made a specialty drink for me that I had while traveling recently that was not on the menu and it was even better than the original.

Lynn C.,"San Jose, United States",0,7,,1.0,11/2/2016,"This is THE worst customer service when ordering thru catering.  They are non-chalant like you're bothering them with so much work.   To top it off, they're SLOW when you pick up.  I've tried th is place 4 times and each time, they've NEVER been on time with pick up.  I've had to wait at least 20 mins.  One visit I went INSIDE thinking that would be quicker.  Ha...  I was told they would get my order. Instead the hostess forgot about me.  I sat there for 10 mins and finally asked someone else if it would be ready soon.  They told me I needed to check in at the bakery counter!  So I ended up waiting another 15 mins while that person checked on my order.  Stupid me.  I thought ok, well I know things are busy there... I'll give it another shot.  This time I waited for 15 mins. to find out I forgot my wallet.  BUT I had my check book.  I pleaded with the catering hostess to take a check and I would return as soon as I dropped off the order at my office (40 people were waiting for lunch!!!).  I would return right after and pay with a credit card.  I promised her she could cash the check if I didn't come back and it would NOT bounce.  Her answer:  ""I'm sorry, it's against our policy to accept checks"".  Here is $550 worth of food sitting in my car and she's going to take it back to the kitchen.  Not sure what she would do with it.  I told her I've order multiple times with them for $500+ catering orders and I wouldn't reneg on them.  No can-do is her answer.   I told her I WOULD NEVER COME BACK AGAIN and this would get a negative YELP review.  She didn't care one bit.

Our favorite dishes are: Ahi Tartare: This is great starter dish, but it's tiny, so I recommend ordering one for every two people if they all want some. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: OOhhhhh this one is good! A good amount of kick, great amount of chicken and shrimp, but a less than impressive amount of noodles in my opinion. However, this is super filling and super tasty. Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: This one is delicious as well! Asparagus, chicken, and penne pasta with yummy spicy chipotle cream sauce.

Wendy Y.,"Fremont, United States",295,615,620,4.0,15/2/2015,"I've been to this particular branch several times and I always have a great dining experience. It's pretty difficult to find parking around here since it is located at the busy Valleyfaire and so many people eat here on a daily basis. Just a note: be prepare to wait on most days! They don't take reservations after 5pm, so I do suggest getting there early or just be prepared to wait.  The amount of different food on the menu is pretty vast. I absolutely love their bread, especially the wheat ones. It's so tasty and we always get refills every time. I don't usually get appetizers here just because I know the entree would be enough for me and I need to order a cheesecake no matter how full I am. You're at the Cheesecake Factory, how can you not order a slice of delicious cheesecake?! As for the entrees, I do tend to get their pastas though. They're all so delicious and very consistent. My two all-time favorites would be the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. They have always been pretty consistent to be and I absolutely love them!  As for dessert, all of their cheesecakes are just so great. I do go for the Red Velvet because I absolutely love red velvet. As compared to the other cakes, it's not as sweet and there's that cake-yness to it. Most are just straight up cheesecake or chocolate and that's a little too strong and too thick for me. I do love cheesecake, but eating a whole slice of cheesecake by yourself is a little too much.  Overall, I enjoy dinning here with friends and family. I always have a great time here and I will definitely be back. You really can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=520

Our waiter was friendly and refilled our bread and water when we asked. I thought the service could've been more attentive, but he was serving everyone in the area we were seated. One of the best parts of The Cheesecake Factory is that the menu is huge, so there's something for everyone. Of course, the warm complimentary bread is delicious, especially the wheat one. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, which came in a huge portion (I took half of it home). The pasta was delicious and cooked al dente with a light wine sauce, so it wasn't heavy or greasy. I noticed that I wasn't offered fresh parmesan on my pasta unlike the couple next to me--I'm not sure if it's only offered for specific pastas, but it wasn't a huge deal. The rest of my family ordered the Factory Combinations (two meats) and we were all satisfied with their meals. At the end of our meal, four staff members came to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to my twin sister and I, and also surprised us with small ice cream sundaes too! We already had cake at home for dessert, so we passed on the cheesecake this time.

Be very specific where you want to sit at though because the will seat you in a very small area if not. My husband complains the size of the cheesecake is smaller than Oakridge.

Tracy T.,"Portola Valley, United States",1,5,,1.0,25/10/2014,"As a party of twelve we tried to make reservations, however the first time we called, we were told that reservations were not accepted after 5pm.  Ok, when we called to confirm our reservation at 5pm, we were then told that they accept no reservations at all on weekends.  Ok, so we arrive at 5:30, on Sat Oct 25th, and are told 1-1.5 hours wait time.  Fine, we wait.  At 7pm we are told 20 more minutes, this goes on until 7:45pm, when they seat a party of 11 that arrived well after us.  We eventually were seated at 8pm, 2.5 hour wait, strung along in 20 minute intervals for 1-1.5 hours longer than we were told. It seems ridiculous both to not take reservations for large parties, or to miss by 2x on a wait time, and to seat large parties significantly out of order from their arrival time. On top of all of that, they were rude, unapologetic, and generally did their very best to attempt to dismiss us, which includes the manager, and he was particularly rude, sarcastic and combative. I literally have never been treated that poorly by a restaurant reception staff, or process.  Regardless of the food, that kind of service is simply unacceptable.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=520

Told me once they ran out of Steak  Dianne, so I ordered Thai glazed salmon and the manager came by to tell me they don't make it anymore and I should try some chicken curry dish because it was similar to salmon--unbelievable. They need new management and a lesson in customer service. The hot grilled chicken for the salad was cold from the fridge and a different manager finally came to apologize.  The waitress asked us if we wanted water after all our food was finally finished, did not bring a soup spoon for the soup at our table despite two waiters being asked and my brother in law had to go search for one.

A month later...I placed an order to go again for my brother who wanted the meat loaf and I ordered my cheesecake again. Yet again, they took about 30 minutes to get me the food I had placed 30 minutes prior!  When I got home, they didnt even pack the cheesecake!  I should have checked before I left to see if it was in there, but I had already waited the 30 minutes and just wanted to get out to beat rush hour. Finally, I came in to eat with my friend and we waited 30 minutes to be seated (there was no one there at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon).  Once we sat down, no one came to serve us for another 15 minutes... with a completely empty restaurant!

I didn't write a review right away just because of the horror but I definitely don't want them to think that they got off scott free without me telling anyone what happened. In the middle of our meal a cockroach crawled up on the table. The managers initial response was that he wished that he ""could see the cockroach"" and that he was  ""surprised that a cockroach would be in the dining room with all of these people"" I informed him number one that I used to be a pest control operator and number two that the fact that a cockroach was in the dining room meant that their kitchen had some serious trouble. But the cockroach granted him his wish and reappeared.  They offered to move us to a new table and they offered me a new entre, REALLY!!! it amazes me that they think I would want to eat another crumb of food out of a kitchen that is clearly infested with cockroaches.

Its no different than going to these other chain restaurants...maybe worse. In fact, I think I may have been exposed to food poisoning...because my stomach was rumbling the next day. But let me tell you what my friends and I had to have this violence occur in my stomach: -Fried Mac & Cheese $9.95 --Description: Crispy Crumb Coated Macaroni and Cheese Balls. Served over a Creamy Marinara Sauce. --Mac & Cheese was gooey and cheesy, fried cheese is alway good, but it wasn't piping hot --marinara sauce was so bland  -Tex Mex Eggrolls $10.95 --Description: Spicy Chicken, Corn, Black Beans, Peppers, Onions and Melted Cheese. Served with Avocado Cream and Salsa. --Egg roll skin wasn't fried crispy enough, skin was a bit dough on some parts, otherwise nothing special -Dynamite Shrimp $6.95  --Description: Crispy Tempura Shrimp Tossed with Our Spicy Dynamite Sauce --Fried lightly, but when it got cold, it wasn't crunchy and nice anymore --Shrimp was really skinny and there was A LOT of breading and there was a lack of seasoning...tossed with spicy dynamite sauce?? Where's the sauce? -Pasta Da Vinci $16.95 --Description: Sautéed Chicken, Mushrooms and Onions in a Delicious Madeira Wine Sauce Tossed with Penne Pasta and Parmesan --Nice mushroom taste, chicken was soft and moist --Pasta was not al dente...way too chewy -STUFFED CHICKEN TORTILLAS 14.95 --Description: Corn Tortillas Stuffed with Spicy Chicken, Covered with Melted Cheese, Green Onion, Tomatillo Sauce and Cilantro. Served with Grilled Corn Cakes, Black Beans, Salsa and Sour Cream --The grilled corn cakes tasted good, the corn was sweet and the cake was crispy --Everything else was bland -Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake $7.50 --Description: Pineapple Cheesecake Between Two Layers of Moist Buttery Pineapple Upside-Down Cake --It was OK. Too much warm whip cream. I felt I got jipped because the size of the cheese cake was small. --Pineapple cake was heavy like fruit cake -TIRAMISU CHEESECAKE $7.50 --Description: Our Wonderful Cheesecake and Tiramisu Combined into one Amazing Dessert! --Nothing Amazing about it. I don't even remember the taste. -FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE $7.50 --Description:Banana Cream Cheesecake Topped with Bavarian Cream and Fresh Sliced Bananas --They mixed artificial banana flavoring in the cheese cake and that was all I tasted. The so called ""bavarian"" cream was no different from the whip cream from my pineapple cheesecake. -CAFE MOCHA $4.95 --Description:Espresso, Chocolate, Steamed Milk, Whipped Cream --Tasted really chalky and powderly --Temporarily disabled my taste buds Overall: 1 star for ""meh"" food and  service. My stomach still hurts a bit when I think about this place. The service felt like what I would get at a Asian restaurant. If I wanted that, I would have gone to one. Our waiter seem very unethusiastic and inattentive to us. He didn't refill our drinks or really checked up on us. The ""free"" bread was barely warm and it was hard. Our utensils were placed ON the table (OMG do they even clean that??) and the soda my friends got were flat...maybe because the soda pitchers were sitting across from us the entire night?--OR maybe they were ice tea as someone here pointed out...ANYWAY...it took awhile for our food to come out.When we went there, it was packed!

Sharonda L.,"Monterey, United States",1,3,,1.0,23/1/2016,The worst customer service in the history of customer service! My $200 coat was stolen and the last people at the table were the staff and management did NOTHING  to assist in the situation. In fact when I refused to pay for my food they threatened to call the police on me! Save yourself the frustration and stay far far far away from this place. The management is horrible.the managers Brian and Brian were super unhelpful! And their was an Asian female Manager that offered me a sweater before threatning to call the police on me. I should have called the police on them. Thanks for ruining my 10 year anniversary. I will never give you my business again.

CHEESECAKE FACTORY is one of my favorite places for their brown rye bread... it's soooo good. Perfection when it's straight out of the oven. If you've tasted that, you know exactly what I mean. Deeeeee-lish! DRINKS I recommend: Peach Bellini or the one I've just had last week... the BLUEBERRY MOJITO. It's so freakin' good and comes in a tall glass too! Just tasty!  FOOD: I personally always get the PASTA DA VINCI. yes, i know i should try different things... but sometimes when you do, you just end up dissapointed... so i always get PASTA D because it's a favorite. i always know it's good. however, all the steaks here are good. lots of flavor!!! i've had them twice. DESSERT: if you love cake, order the LEMONCHELLO!!! that's another favorite of mine. i'm not really into milk or dark chocolate all that much, so the strawberries and sweetness and lemon tartiness of the cake is just the perfect balance.  however, if you were to ask me for cheesecake recommendations: i'd suggest the red velvet (but only if you prefer more cream cheese than cake since there's 3 layers of it), the white chocolate raspberry (reallllly gooood combo), the snickers chunk cheesecake, or the tiramisu one! and last tip: if you stop by the bar, make sure LYNNA makes your drink. she recommended that mojito and makes it so good!! :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=680

We always order the Chicken Costoletta, it's probably the most savory chicken dish I've ever had. However, last night we came for our 5 year anniversary and were extremely bugged by our server Marilyn. The time before last night that we were here, we left a $31 tip on a $50 tab  and last night we left a $9.30 tip on a $60 tab and I honestly didn't want to tip her. We got here at about 11:10 pm and everything was going great, we ordered quickly and she came with our drinks pretty fast. However, she could not let us enjoy our meal in peace, she popped up literally every 3 minutes asking us the same question. She interrupted our conversations all the time and 3 of those times were to push us into buying a cheesecake that we didn't even want since we don't like cheesecake. A couple of minutes later, WE WERE STILL NOT DONE EATING and she just comes and picks up our plates and asks if we want boxes. Are you freaking kidding me?! So thoughtless and rude to just pick up our food without asking if we were even done eating. At this point my girlfriend and I were so annoyed. When the server brought us our tab she circled the recommended gratuity with a heart at the bottom of the receipt, she did that on both receipts and she then stayed the whole time  that we were writing the tip on the tab. I was so pissed off at this point, this is my favorite restaurant and we honestly should've just gone to Yard House across the street, because she totally ruined our mood for the night. I don't know if she's new or not but that is not the way to go about service.

We put our name down at 7:20 for a party of 14 and was told the expected time is 1.75 to 2 hour wait . We had no problem because it is a Saturday night . However after 2 hours, we did not even receive a buzzer . 30 minutes later we got a buzzer and said about a 10 minute wait before we can be seated . We waited another 20 minutes until I found out that other customers would not leave the tables that we needed . No buggy, it's not their fault .  However , our tables were set and we sat ourselves because no host came to take us to our seats . Then right off the bat, our waitress comes with a small attitude trying to rush us to get our orders in . After ordering, our food took almost 30 minutes to come out, and you can not tell me that they wait for all the food to be ready because all the burgers did not come until 10 minutes after . Another issue that really irked me was when a guest of mine asked for cheese the waitress never came with any so we asked again , and we let her know that we asked and she said she would come back and she then replied with attitude, rolled her eyes, and walked away .  Lastly, my food came out dry and I requested for some extra sauce and I asked 2 different waiters for the sauce . I waited until half my party already finished their food before I called the manager to complain . Fortunately the manager was nice enough to give my food for free, take away gratuity, as well ask pack my food up with its extra sauce . Afterwards, three other waiters along with or waitresses were off staring at us and whispering.  This place has one of the most rude service I have ever experienced .

Latter is the case now.This cheesecake factory location near valley Fair Mall , San Jose is unbelievable. I went on a Sunday night around 8pm and the wait was 30-50 mins which is acceptable, but even after my buzzer went on we were not seated saying 'it doesn't work that way ' ,why the hell did you give me that thing then.. well, after we were seated, for 20 mins! ,none of the servers cared to come, let alone take our orders. I really want to mention my order number which is 27 on the 19 th of March ,server was a tall well built man who couldn't understand what we were ordering and had to look at the menu which my guess should be a new recruit and who didn't care enough to bring us our water after waiting for 30 mins. Later we had to ask an Asian guy who was serving the next table for what's happened to the starter bread and water, he was like am not 'responsible for ur food n ur service okay!' and he was talking to me like am a freaking 3 year old  and man don't I know servers take up alloted tables in a hotel , can't he be at least courteous enough to say 'ok, I will look for ur server  and bring some water in the mean time'. After a gruesome wait we had to stop a man who was not our server AGAIN and ask to at least bring our drinks, he passed us 3 times after that without glancing . How can I blame him if 'my table's server' didn't even bother to show up after all our talk with the manager which was after 45 mins wait . The manager who was a lady was like u don't have to pay any bill , I didn't taste any damn thing in ur restaurant to take out my wallet.

Nikki A.,"San Jose, United States",21,28,58,5.0,2/9/2015,The Cheesecake Factory..... Oh the cheesecake!!!! Loooove this place. Nice for a fancy dinner or date.  The food is obviously going to be more expensive because of the ambiance as well but it's really good if you want to treat yourself!!  I alwaaaaays have to order the avocado rolls for $10. It fills me up and I don't have to buy a big pasta dish for dinner anymore. I always go with an appetizer or 2 for my dinner here when I come here for my friend's birthdays cause I'm a cheap ass and only order from that one page. Pretty obvious by the name of the restaurant but the cheese cakes are bomb ass hell!!!!!  $30 for a 7'' cake but it was totally worth it.. Also my mom made me buy it. Anyyywaayysss.  If you're eating here might as well say it's your birthday to get a free ice cream out of it!!! LOL.

My family and I just had a horrible experience of lousy customer service and being mistreated at the CheeseCake Factory located in the Valley Fair Mall. My family and I arrived at the restaurant for what we were looking forward to as a nice meal and overall experience at the place in the evening. And I am sad to say that what transpired was an exact opposite and an utter feeling distaste. We placed our food order, we're just served appetizer and drinks and were kept waiting for more than 45 minutes. We did get a hearty serving of extremely shabby and horrible customer service by a couple of discourteous staff ... They know who I am talking about ! Instead of apologizing and accepting the fault in their discourteous service, and trying to compensate for the dissatisfaction  the staff that we dealt with just acted like its business as usual !

Linda R.,"San Jose, United States",62,29,,1.0,31/5/2016,"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I normally like CF food but this was a HORRIBLE experience.  First we were seated on the 'lighter' side of the restaurant only to be told minutes later that the host had seated us wrong and then we were put on the dim side. Ok, not horrible yet, but annoying.  Then we waited 40 minutes for our meal to come out. I ordered the Herb crusted salmon, mash, and asparagus, my hubby ordered the pork chop, mash and green beans. The salmon was TASTELESS and barely cooked. Seriously, this is fish, how long does it take to cook well? My mashed potatoes were cold. My hubby's mash had some black stuff in it that we couldn't identify but when we told the manager she confirmed that it was burnt potatoes??? OMG! The green beans had no flavor either and tasted as if they were sitting in a pot of water for hours.  The service: Once I brought the ridiculously long wait time to the attention to the manager, the waitress got irritated and appreared to not be interested in trying to serve us any further. Which is STUPID because the food wasnt directly her fault so not sure why she was acting all butt hurt. Being that our waitress was MIA I had to ask a hostess to call a manager and she acted like she didnt hear me. RUDE!  The manager's that I spoke to were respectful and nice and comp'd us a cheesecake and the meal, but at $20+/plate I expected more so that I wouldn't have had to talk to the managers.  You can be sure we will not be returning.

Parking sucks, of course! Service and wait times suffer because of their volume in terms of food, drink, and larger parties, though am willing to sacrifice for the quality and servings you get in return for the decent price points.  I AM a foodie, and picky about it, and how it's served, etc. For now, this restaurant works well for me since they're not too formal, and yet they're not po-dunk, and it's a place to which I can go to with family, or if I just wanna have fun with friends. This last visit, though, I went with the Baja Chicken Tacos, which were good. The web description is as follows -  Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Avocado,Tomato, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Black Beans and Rice. They could've been ""slightly warmer"", though we had already been waiting a whole hour and 15 minutes for our table; not to mention the wait-time for food, so I wasn't about to send it back. Still pretty good, though.  The chicken was on the border being barely moist and still decent. Didn't taste the spice, either. Asked for extra avocado, though don't think they really added any extra, cuz each taco only had a quarter of an avocado on top of each one; the waiter claimed that they added extra. I stand by the Romano Chicken as my favorite, also the warm (rye, i think) bread, and vanilla cheesecake.  On the other hand, I DO set my expectations accordingly, and would still come back for more, considering the quality, amount, and quality that you get for the price.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=660

On really busy days like Saturday's or during the lunch and dinner rush, expect service to be at a snail's pace. If you're with a large party, expect to wait about 40 min  or longer to be seated. I went with a party of seven last year, on a Tuesday night for dinner. We waited over 45 min until we were seated. Because of the long wait, we received a free appetizer.  Another time, my parents and I went for an early Sunday lunch, we were seated immediately but no one came to our table afterwards. We were the first people seated in the section but everyone seated after us was seen to first. After over 20 minutes of waiting for service (no one came to take our drink order) I finally got hold of a seating hostess and was told there was no server for our table. She hadn't come in yet.  So why the hell were we seated there? We were given a free meal and three free desserts for the grievous error on their part. We didn't go back for almost 4 months after that fiasco.

It should have been a red flag when the Manager stopped by and apologized for the wait.... But that was it, about 20 minutes later we received our food. No apologies from the server, no slight inclination as to why it took forever? Dumbstruck we ate our food, which was actually pretty good. I hope subbing chicken chorizo for Avocado and using egg whites only wasn't the hold up, but the table kept teasing me that it was :(  The size of the burrito was about the size of my head, no joke. This thing was as huge as a body builder's forearm, eyes glazed over, I dug in. Great flavor, fresh Avocado, slightly spicy (but we all know how much of a wimp I am). Instead of a side of beans, I got the Spanish rice, which was a great addition to the burrito. I have no complaints with my food, nor did anyone else at the table. The flavor was on point.

I try to be very understanding, however the Cheesecake factory at Valley fair really pushed the limits. Now, keep in mind this has nothing to do with the food, just the customer service at this particular Cheesecake factory. We had a very large party for a special event between coworkers. My job is VERY customer oriented, so ALL of my coworkers know the value of making the customer feel HAPPY and WELCOME. So here's the deal. My coworkers called the cheesecake factory to make reservations for our large group. They did not take reservations... no problem! One of my coworkers was sent to the Cheesecake Factory to put her name down. She was informed that we would not be seated until 80% of the table was there. No problem, everything is still normal.  Now here is where the Cheesecake factory REALLY dropped the ball. They gave away our table not only once, but TWICE! But it gets better- they didn't even inform us about the situation. We were informed that Marsha, the manager ""did what she had to do."" Well, Marsha, I'll tell you what you have to do.... Inform your customers as to when you'll be making them wait over an hour for a table that you'll be giving away TWICE with no warning. It's really not that hard to do.

I love that they only offered us to give us a free birthday dessert for the wait which is standard at most restaurants like this one. Paying almost $100.00 for this was so horrible.

Today we had Vietnamese Tacos (scrumptious) Sausage Ricotta Flat Bread Beet Salad and the Chicken Salad. Everything was absolutely perfect.  I eat way too much dark sweet bread they set on the table.

It was a great place to go where a party of six could each order something completely different from one another and enjoy it thoroughly. Perhaps I've just grown tired of the standard routine there, or perhaps this location just isn't on top of their game the same way others are. I'm not sure. But I've gone twice now and it's just been okay... and it used to be a destination restaurant for me. The service is just so-so now. Certainly nothing special. Maybe they're not training their staff as well, or perhaps the standards of service in the South Bay just don't compete. There's always a wait and there are always lots of unbussed tables when you enter. They're not efficient like they once were. They've taken a lot of excellent items off of the menu (hello Shrimp Poor Boy) and replaced them with a lot of uninspiring choices. It's still tasty. I'll still return. But it's not the bomb the way it once was.

Most occasions I love the Chicken garlic and Farfalle bow tie pasta.  It is one of those pastas that can be heavy but so worth it if you split it into two meals.  Tip: do not try to finish it all in one sitting or you will regret it and never wanna order it again.   Though the last time I've ordered the pasta either there was a new cook or they changed the recipe to be less dense and heavy.  The sauce was watery and the garlic cream sauce was nonexistent. I was very disappointed.  Even after requesting more cream sauce to put on my sauceless pasta, the side cream sauce didn't taste right like all the years before.

Their appetizer may be the only compelling thing for folks, and of course their cheesecake. I remember how I used to go to the one in Sac, just to get the cakes. Now after realizing how BAD they are for you, I no longer go there. BUT I do have to admit that their baguette is super yummy..the wheat/brown one that is.

We've dined at multiple cheesecake restaurants so we knew we wouldn't be disappointed with the menu options. We were greeted and seated within 5 minutes of arriving. The place wasn't too busy for a Friday, I'm assuming because it was in between their lunch and dinner rush. Although it took our server a few minutes longer than it should have to greet us and get our drinks started, she was all around a pleasant server. Because my boyfriend and i are both in the restaurant industry, we offend critique the service we receive without even noticing. Despite having a pleasant experience, my boyfriend couldn't help but notice another couple who was sat at the same time as us and had not been greeted. We were probably 20 minutes into our dining and their server had walked past them multiple times. Our server, who had the section adjacent to theirs, also failed to acknowledge them. This bothered us so much that we made sure to notify a manager, simply because someone should have took it upon themselves to greet them or start their order if their server was too busy.

The bread came out at the beginning was warm and I had no intention of eating it but he broke part of the sourdough, buttered it, and made a mini sandwich and placed it on my side plate - ""Awww, right?""  Ever since he poured me my soda at Hunan House Restaurant... I was sold!  He was a gentleman and still is =) We didn't order dessert (a shocker, really) because we were both stuffed.  I didn't even need my Diet Coke refilled but he got his Coke w/ no ice refilled.. at least in the end we had a pleasant time together, a good tasting meal but we had to put up w/ the grim of our server.   Hopefully our experience will be better next time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=700

I ended up waiting 2 hours on my birthday... - There are times where food just seems to take days to come out. Main courses are usually big, so it's perfect for sharing. By the time that you've downed the bread and main dish, you'd be extremely stuffed. The environment is great for big groups or a one on one dinner date.

But tonight, I ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta and it was disappointing. I got a mountain of pasta with not enough sauce to flavor it evenly.

Portion size in general here is a bit much for me and I would normally be okay with taking home leftovers for lunch the next day, but I really didn't want to be taking home this much bland pasta tonight.

This place was filled with people packed like sardines into booths and screaming babies around every corner. As expected, the vegetarian options are pasta or salad. I opted for the baked ziti and it was good, but after several spoonfuls i felt completely stuffed. The amount of cheese and cream in my dish was enough to fill me with regret from agreeing to let my friends choose the spot for our dinner date.

The house bread was delicious, especially the brown one. I like to dip the bread in ranch--a new discovery, thanks to L :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=740
Rose C.,"Milpitas, United States",227,364,198,2.0,13/9/2011,"My previous experiences with Cheesecake have been better, but Sunday night was just a disaster!  My mother has never been to Cheesecake Factory and she's not really the type to spend over 10 dollars for an entree, but since my sister and I were craving, we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory. The previous times I've been there I've loved it. The cheesecake is delicious (they have so many flavors!) and the pasta is good. However, I usually go there for lunch when the food is MUCH MUCH cheaper! I was saddened to find that the Pasta Da Vinci is almost 18 dollars....EIGHTEEN DOLLARS? Geez. I can buy two pairs of jeans and a top at Ross or at Forever21. My sister also wanted the same thing so we ended up both getting the Pasta Da Vinci. My mother wanted something with shrimp so we ordered her the Pasta Franchese and it was HORRIBLE. Something clearly went wrong in the cooking process. The breaded shrimp was delicious, but the pasta was incredibly salty. If you ate just one strand your mouth would blow up with saltiness. Unlike the description on the menu, there was only 2 or 3 pieces of artichoke hearts within the pasta. We asked the waitress to swap out of the pasta, and she did, and came back with a new batch which was still salty, and so we asked for Penne instead which was STILL disgustingly salty. My mother didnt end up eating any of her food which wasted a good 15 dollars. It wasn't the waitress's fault, she was very sweet and accommodating, but really? Why was the pasta so damn salty? My food was fine. So the bill came out to 53 dollars plus an 8 dollar tip, but my mother refuses to ever go again. Also, it was freakin' cold in there.

Jane Q.,"San Jose, United States",2,21,20,1.0,1/3/2016,"I've been to this specific location many times in the past but this review is about my visit last night. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by at this location to have a couple of drinks and order some salads. We arrived around 8 o'clock on February 29th. We sat at the bar.  Cheesecake factory makes really good Mojitos and just a few days ago I was at this location and ordered one and it was really good but the Mojito that I ordered last night wasn't that well done. My boyfriend ordered double gin and soda and he said it was good.  As for food I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad and I can't believe they were OK with serving me that gross tasting salmon. The salmon tasted old and it was cold. It took longer than the usual to have it served to us so I think they might have left it at the counter for a while until they picked it up to serve it.  Also,When I ordered my salad I asked for plate of bread which is the complementary bread that they serve to every customer but every time I stop by they automatically serve it,this time though I had to ask for it twice until I got it and the quality of the bread was pretty much the same as the salmon that I had on my salad, old and cold.  After taking two bites from the salmon I couldn't help but feel so grossed out by it so I pushed my plate to the side and our server asked if I wanted a box for my food and I had to tell him that it didn't taste god at all and the bread did not taste fresh. The server asked if I wanted to order something else off the menu , but worrying that somebody's going to spit in my food I didn't order anything else. It was disappointing and the server, even though he asked if I wanted something else, he didn't seem to care that my experience wasn't pleasant at all. Service wasn't special and food was gross. I don't think that's the general quality that's served here but it definitely wasn't good quality last night.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=400

We were ignored by the waiter. Then I ordered a burger which the waiter brought out 40+ minutes later without the fries! Then told me the fries were on their way.

They had to take it back and remake my original order, which came out super soggy and watery!! It is probably the worst carbonara I've ever had. It was more like a soup!! So disappointed!  My friend ordered a gluten free burger and they brought out a regular burger which they almost served to her. Both of us have gluten allergies so these kinds of mistakes cannot happen. This would be a huge liability!  They don't offer a single gluten free cheesecake option on their menu. Can you believe that? Another disappointment.  Cheesecake needs to step up their game on gluten free menu offerings or else I'm never coming back here.  I could've made a huge commotion about these screw ups but I didn't want to deal with the drama. It was the new year and so I just wanted to be chill about things...

The food here, depending on what you get, is usually pretty good. I go here semi-regularly, here are my favorites:  Appetizers:  *Fried Mac N Cheese*- Delicious! Must try! I order it every time, but beware, don't let them get cold! Eat them PIPING HOT! Crispy outer layer holds well, with gooey EXTREMELY cheesy shell mac inside. I can't resist, it comes with 4, and they are fairly large.  *Potstickers*- Potstickers are potstickers, the sauce is amazing!  Entrees:  *Crusted Chicken Romano* I believe it comes with pasta which I do not care for, so I always sub. for mashed potatoes.  *Orange chicken* Truly one of my absolute favorites here, fried chicken with sweet orange sauce, amd the rice here really good! (Weird, I know, because its just steamed white rice, but it goes so well with the sauce!)  My sister, brother and dad pretty much always enjoy the *Chicken Madeira* which I know is very popular. Cheesecake:  *Tuxedo* ALL TIME FAVORITE. Have been eating this cheesecake since I was a kid! (I should really be a chubster..) *White Chocolate Raspberry* If you like raspberry at all, YOU MUST TRY THIS, if you haven't had anything White Chocolate & Raspberry you need to seriously make it a priority, haha, because it is the BEST combonation in the WORLD!  *Oreo* Standard oreo cheesecake. Pretty f***ing good!  Raspberry lemonade is definitely recommended!  The interior is beautiful! Kind of fancy but not like you need to dress up. Place is kept clean, bathrooms and eating areas, along with small waiting area (which gets crowded durimg rush hours) are all nicely maintained.

Yeah the food portions are huge and it is like a fancier Applebee's or something. I've been here a couple times for dinner and the prices are around $15 for plates. The portions are pretty big so you will probably have leftovers. A negative is that the wait is around 45 minutes My review will be based off of their famous desserts! There are soooo many delicious slices of cheesecake/cake to choose from and it was just so hard to choose one. I ended up making a great decision and got the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cake. MY GOODNESS. EVERYTHING YOU WANT AND MORE. Peanut butter, chocolate and I even found a piece of butterfinger on the bottom. It is VERY rich and thick so I only finished half and saved the other half for the next day. In my head I thought, it is just one cheesecake, how bad can it be? I looked up the calorie count online and I almost fainted at how ridiculous it is. IT IS 1300 calories!!!! hahaha I LOLed when I saw this but it was sooo worth it.  Overall, the entrees are alright and the dessert is bomb. **TIPS** 1) Watch those calories when you choose a dessert. It will go straight to your hips.

Even though I used to work here, the only real problem that I have with it is that the food is SO heavy. I ordered the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes which are always so delicious. Even though it is an appetizer, it is so heavy and large that I was able to eat it as an entree. Everything you order comes in a huge portion, which is good for the price, but not on your waistline. They are great at accommodating large groups, but it still takes quite some time since they do not take reservations. I would recommend for one person in your party to come early about an hour to an hour and a half and put your name down. Then plan that whatever time they quote you add 15 to 20 mins on top of that. Once you get your time just head to the mall and relax. That lobby gets so crazy, just standing in there gives me a headache.

Cosmopolitan, Margarita, Long Island and Mojiot for $5 AND the appetizers! $5 calamari, rolls etc etc during Happy Hour is my Happy Hour dream-come-true. Happy Hour starts at 4pm and ends at 6 pm. They have a full bar and the bartenders are awesome! They know I mean alcohol and that's what I get. hehe. The Mai Tai is deadly and the martini is as dirty as it gets (only if you like). Their fish of the day is always fresh and their Luau Salad - smashing. Staff is attentive and if you come here early, there's plenty of seating. Cozy and the ambiance is pretty cool. I always love coming to this branch too. It's a few walks away from Santana Row, Macy's and Valley Fair Mall. If you run outta cashy, Chase is right around the corner too. My favorite cheesecake,  if I may recommend - tiramisu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=760
Cheri A.,"San Jose, United States",13,17,86,5.0,13/1/2014,"I love this restaurant, we come here a lot and just cant get enough. Some times the wait can be a little long but for us its worth it, when we go out were in no rush so the wait doesn't bother us. The menu has a great selection and the service is always amazing. Some of the tables can be a little close to others on busy days but if your willing to wait a booth is better. But once we sat close to another older couple who was celebrating their 36th anniversary and we ended up pushing our tables together and had a nice dinner with them, so sometimes it just works better in the end!  Tips: Come before 6pm, we usually do an early dinner at 5:30 and the wait if any is short, weekends of course are busy so lunch time is better, or around 8pm for a late dinner.  p.s. We love the deep fried macaroni and cheese appetizer!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=760

We originally had a male server; his service was great, we loved it, but when we were introduced to her, she made my table felt as though we were trouble to her. One of the plates that we ordered was the Cajun jambalaya, usually the dish is really good, but yesterday, it was bland. We asked her if we can have some marinara sauce to add to the dish, she came back with it, yet tossed it on the table. I myself have been going here for years, but after yesterday, I would not come back.

I came 40 minutes earlier than i had said.  Thank you to the girl at the bakery for telling me nicely that the cake was still in the back because I was early.  I sat down and waited patiently as they got my cake.   I ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheese cake.  it was very rich.  I could only eat a very small slice.  It looked gorgeous with the dark chocolate crust and the white chocolate and raspberry swirled in the cheese cake.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=760

As far as chain restaurants go, this one is great. They have tasty bread, fairly quick service (at this one), and great cheesecakes! I got a great shrimp angel hair dish and loved the crab bites and avocado eggrolls. For dessert (because you would be insane to not eat dessert here) we got a piece of Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake and the Reeses something something Cheesecake (it's a new flavor). Both were delicious. The Reeses sneakily has a layer with snickers in it, and the chocolate cake actually contains a layer of coconut cheesecake to break up that chocolatey goodness.

The things is we packed some things to go because we were full and when they brought things back we grab them and left. When we got home, one of the boxes was food from another table, which really ruined the whole experience. We were very excited to finish our food later but nope, I'm not eating other people's lunch.

The food was great, but I had all kinds of issues with having to wait for things. Waiting to be seated after being called (with other groups being called and seated before me), waiting to order a drink, waiting for that drink, and waiting for an appetizer. Dirty dishes were also a problem. Luckily, they started a shift change while I was eating. Everything changed for the better. Quicker response times, more attentiveness, etc. My second waitress was much better at her job than the hostesses or my original waiter. All that said, I did complain to the manager. He appeared to be very concerned with the issues I had and voluntarily gave me a significant discount on my meal. He did a great job of turning a bad experience into a more positive one. I would have rated my visit as a 1 or 2 star, but given the turn around, I have increased it to 4.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=760

Maybe late Sunday night is the rack?  Was told about 15mins was only like 5 to get seated for two.  Cool interior.   Drinks: Strawberry smoothie  $5.95 Icy, watery, not much flavor, skip. House (Berriger) white zin; $6.95 - you gotta be kiddin,  for a less than 1/2 filled glass?  skip... Apps: Fried Mac & cheese:  crispy outside, creamy inside.  not much zing, a little sweet, needed some pep.  creamy and fresh tomato sauce.  $8.95 for 4??  idk, 2 for $4.99 would have been better, and didn't like the slightly sweet cheesy flavor.  skip.  when they packed the lefties they didn't include any sauce...  Kids would love it tho, they's be happy with just this. Sweet corn Fritters:  very good.  hush puppy type breading, perfectly cooked corn.  $4.95 for six or so, good value for money.  Mustard sauce?  Not!  more like chipotle mayo.  still, good with the fritters.  Lefties were packaged w/o sauce...  :( entres: Pasta carbonara.  Superb!  Lots of bacon flavor. Diff server, but she  brought fresh basil when asked and offered fresh cheese.  $13.50.  Nice portion, but over priced.  You and me know how much we can make this for at home... Special:  fried shrimp platter $13.95. Great portion, lots of butterflyed crispy shrimp with fatastic tartar sauce (big hit of garlic) and light coctail sauce; needed a bit of zip, some hot sauce offered would have been nice.  Outstanding coleslaw and perfectly cooked frites, katsup was offered and accepted.  Minus!  Again, forgot to pack my coleslaw in the lefties...I know, I should have looked in the bag....sigh.   It was really good... Deserts: Apple caramel strusel.  Fantastic.   Banana cream:  another big hit; the whipped cream stood up for two whole days!  BF used to be a card-carrying cheesecake hater!  Dare I say we've witnessed a new birth? ...LOL Other pluses:  Ryan was pretty attentive and appologized when he was taking too long.   when Ryan boxed our lefties, he provided two fresh warm loaves of the breads for EACH of us wrapped in foil.  big plus there.  we didn't ask for that, we'd been happy just to take what we left on our table.  diff server brought fresh basil when asked and offered fresh cheese for the bf's pasta. Minus:  Someone else served our entre's and got the bf's wrong.  Though she said ""cabonara"" and we both pointed to the bf, we thought it was strange it had bowtie pasta.  Then we noticed the chicken.  BF specifically ordered no chic.  New lady server went to get the cheese, and when she came back bf pointed out the error.  She said something like, ""let me check"" something and disapeared.  The bf sneaked a few bites of the pasta.  Said it was WAAAAYYY undercooked...  Anyway, she comes back very appologetic and asks what he wants.  Well, he's DYING for some creamy pasta full of bacon!  So away goes the offending dish, and wham zam, the correct dish is in front of the bf.  I think he got served somebody else's dish...oh well, it happens... Attentive service at first got lax as the evening wore on, but hey, they got busy, and we weren't in a hurry.  Again, nice Ryan appolgized when he laxed.  Some fresh sauce in a small plastic container for the fritters and mac would have made a five star.  And they completely didn't box my leftie coleslaw, that I paid for.... :( Total for above w/o tax or gratuity:  $75.10 We thought the wine and pasta was over priced.  There's lots on the menu we want to try, but we will skip the high priced drinks and be more choosy about the apps and entree's, since we also felt the cabonara was overpriced for the portion, and if there's a next time, we will deff check our doggie boxes to make sure everything we paid for is in there.   we're going again, for sure",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=760

Does not take reservations. -------------------------------------------- The food at cheesecake factory is awesome! I really do enjoy coming here although I really should come here only once in a while. After looking through the calorie counts for all the dishes you definitely start to regret the food. One time I got the Royal Caramel Macchiato which was SOO delicious, but it was 600 calories for a drink. It's a definite rainy day drink that comes warm. I love love love the cheesecake at cheesecake factory. (I mean their name is cheesecake factory right?! They better do the cheesecake justice.) I'm the type of person that LOVES the original cheesecake that's a solid chunk of cream cheese without any cake in it. Snickers Chunk Cheesecake - Very good! I really liked this cheesecake. Vanilla Bean Cheesecake - This one wasn't very good to me. It seemed like a vanilla bean custard was the majority of the cheesecake while the bottom later of the cheesecake was in fact the original cheesecake. I don't think I'd get this one again. Buttery Nipple Shot - It was definitely tasty as a buttery nipple shot should be. Though I have to say that I've had better.

Anne M.,"Stanford, United States",5,293,78,2.0,20/10/2014,"I have a major concern with this place. You arrive, they tell you that it's going to be 15minutes wait and give you a buzzer. The buzzer rings after 15m, you go up and hand it in to the lady who then asks you to stand in a line. Stand in the line and wait another 10m for someone to shout your name ( why can't the buzzer just ring when they are actually ready to seat you?). Then we are taken to our table, but we can't order because we have to wait for our server to come take the order, the lady that brings us to the table can't take any orders but water.  Once you order and can actually eat your food, you have someone come every 5m to ask if everything is ok, to ask if we are still working on this or can they clear the table, etc.  I appreciate that they want to make sure that everything is ok and want to provide good customer service, but the whole thing means that it is impossible to have a conversation because you are interrupted every 2 seconds. In addition, the whole thing feels really rushed, like they are trying to do everything as fast as possible. I went there to have a relaxing time and didn't.

The louisiana chicken pasta is usually always a safe bet and the chopped factory salad is also amazing! its an appetizer but its frickin massive. My most recent trip here, I got the arugula salad which was only 5 bucks (under small plates and snacks) and a slice of black out cake (7 bucks). The arugula salad was pretty filling for being under ""small plate"" and the black out cake was sooooooo good, if you need a chocolate fix, this will totally hit the spot. but its huge so share with a friend!

Norma I.,"American Canyon, United States",294,132,280,4.0,29/3/2014,"I've been at this location a few times now. I am not a huge fan of big chain restaurants, but the Cheesecake Factory has always been a fan favorite amongst several of my friends. It is a great place for friends to meet up and the menu has enough variety to satisfy most everyone's taste.   Surprisingly, I have never had an unusually long wait at this location, like I have at so many of the other Cheesecake Factories. Our wait was approximately 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad on a Thursday night. I have had as long as a 2 hour wait when I went to the Marina Del Rey location on a weekend night. Uuugh! We sat down at a table across the floor from the bar. The old world charm of the decor and the sultry lighting adds to the charm of this place. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with describing items on the menu that some of us were unfamiliar with. She was also great at making suggestions on certain items. I ordered one of their signature combinations: Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane. It is a sauteed chicken breast with fresh asparagus & melted mozzarella cheese, topped with a mushroom Madeira Sauce. It is so tasty! It didn't sound at all that appealing on the menu, but I am so glad that it was suggested and I ordered it. The chicken was tender and the various flavors really made this dish a hit. I believe I found a new favorite! The Steak Diane are beef medallions covered with black peppercorns & a rich mushroom wine sauce, served with mashed potatoes. My meat was not cooked at all the way I asked! I told them I like my meat medium, more on the rare side, but no blood! I want it pink without blood oozing out! I was assured that they would make it the way I wanted, but that this would be considered medium cooked. It came to me tough and chewy. You would have thought I asked for it to be cooked well done. I hadn't plan to say anything because there was so much food on my plate that I knew I would not be able to eat it. Besides, I was enjoying my chicken. But one of my friends mentioned it to my waitress. She came over and I explained to her how the meat was. She took a look at it and agreed that it was over cooked. There was no pink in the meat at all. She went back to the kitchen and came back with another steak cooked exactly the way I had asked and my friend ate it because I was stuffed! He loved it! lol! My friends ordered a variety of cheesecakes to share, but I am not a huge fan of cheesecake. I had an ex- that had me on cheesecake overload and I have stayed away from it ever since! But OMG! The Strawberry Shortcake is so yummy! It is made on their own homemade biscuit, sprinkled with sugar and covered with fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream. I love it! I know most people come here to eat their incredibly tasting cheesecakes. There are so many to choose from. But I love the Strawberry Shortcake! All their dinner portions are huge. You can share a dish with a friend, but always save room for dessert. This is what you come here for! :) Enjoy!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=780

Andrea S.,"San Jose, United States",0,16,,3.0,11/1/2015,"My husband and I came here for a date night and this is my review of our visit.  Firstly, I was disappointed that we could not make reservations, because it always seems to be packed. So we showed up and was very busy for a Thursday evening; loud and crowded. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  After a few minutes our server brought us our drinks and bread and returned a few minutes later to take our order. We asked him what he would recommend and at first it seemed like he was a little annoyed with the questions. More like ""I'm busy, just hurry and order"", but after a minute he decided to be more helpful. My husband ordered the garlic noodle dish and I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken.  Both dishes were decent, not horrible but definitely nothing spectacular. Wouldn't order either dish again.  I went with the intention of having a slice of cheesecake for dessert but ended up not getting a slice after all.  Not for any bad reason,  I was just full.

Stephanie H.,"Santa Clara, United States",1636,160,273,3.0,13/6/2012,"3.5 stars I really don't like American food. I really don't. Places like Cheesecake Factory have mediocre if not tasteless tasting food at ridiculous prices with high fat and cholesterol content.  I don't want to pay $10+ for a stupid salad, burger, sandwich, or bland spaghetti plate I could make myself. However, what I do give Cheesecake Factory 5 stars for are their homemade CHEESECAKES! They are pretty pricey, around $7 I think for a slice, but they are HUGE slices.  I can't finish one slice in one sitting.  I believe they have 50% off cheesecakes during some time of the year.  I wouldn't come here to eat anything besides their outstanding cheesecakes.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=780

Meadow S.,"Campbell, United States",418,19,2,1.0,26/4/2015,"Congratulations to the Cheesecake Factory for being my first bad yelp review!!! Let me just say wow do you guys deserve it :) I think it's fair to say that I will never be returning to this place after the experience I had. My friends and I all decided to come here for dinner tonight because we had a couple of coworkers leaving and wanted to have a farewell dinner and we all decided the Cheesecake factory was the place for us (we were obviously wrong). Because we all work in customer service ourselves we tried our best to be as helpful as possible by calling in advance to let them know we were coming, and having someone there to check us in so they can prepare for a very large group. You would think the respect would be reciprocated but it was apparent that they could care less about their customers when they gave our table away TWICE. Did they really think 16 girls sitting in a lobby for 45 min would be better then holding the table for 5 more min? We decided to give California Pizza Kitchen a call and they seated us immediately (take notes). Not only were they so accommodating but they also made us all feel very welcomed and went above and beyond for us. They gave us all the customer service that you would expect at a pretentious place like The Cheesecake Factory. I know that in the future when we plan large party dinners (which we do very often) we will be going to CPK now.  Moral of the story, this place could care less about their customers, if they did then they would've helped a large party with open arms instead of leaving us all frantic looking for a place to fit us in in such short notice (something we obviously tried to avoid) If you want to go somewhere great to eat go to CPK!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=820

I feel like Cheesecake Factory is definitely hyped up, especially the one in SF and this one is no different. Came here because I owed a bestie from a bet - and it's his favorite restaurant AND once again I was starving - I love wheat bread! Sat down as they dimmed the lights. Errr maybe it's because it seemed too romantic for me? And it's kinda awk with a bestie, know what I mean? Anyway. Got Salsbury Steak off the special menu, and he got Kobe Burger.  Salsbury Steak topped with thick sauce and cooked onions came with mashed potatoes and peas, yum! I've been craving mashed potatoes for the longest time! But it was kinda dry though :\ Traded off and had some of his Kobe Burger. It was good, but wasn't to die for. The fries that were included were good! But didn't want too much of that.

Their menu is extensive, espeically in pasta dishes and cheesecake of course. I had the Pomegranate Margarita - on the rocks, its tart & moderately sweet, but not enough tequila!! :( Factory Combo: Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane - I thought the shrimp scampi came with pasta, but to my surprise it didnt.. I was sad, thought I was going to have a little bit of pasta & steak.  So in the middle of my plate was a mountain of mash potato, to the left was the steak (more like 4-5 small pieces) with mushrooms tossed with some Asian soysauce dressing and to the right was 3 lightly battered jumbo shrimp sitting on some creamy white sauce with pieces of tomato.  It was decent, but I dont know if I'll order this again, considering they have so many other dishes to choose from. I really wanted to try their cheesecake, but was too full to even try.  I think the next time I come here, I won't finish up all my food, but leave room for dessert. :))",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=820

My brother, his son, and friend got pasta dishes. My mom got the salmon, and my sweetheart got fries. For dessert we shared a Hershey's chocolate chip cheesecake and chocolate fudge cake, and of course my special birthday treat! Everyone loved their food and had leftovers to take home. Who knew getting older could be so much fun? Bring it on! The booths are big enough to open presents at the table, and enough elbow room for everyone. Several waiters including our own came to sing to me, as they did for a couple others so I clearly was in good birthday company for the evening! I love that it's nice enough here to really dress up, or not if you don't feel like it. We were dressed up. A waitress even agreed to take pictures for us! Splendid! I really have to hand it to the staff here. They work amidst a lot of noise and deal with a lot of people and really hold it together.

The decor is lovely and I've always been satisfied with the customer service. The wheat bread is here is so delicious also! I call it chocolate bread because the bread is a really dark brown. Their wheat bread is always moist, warm, and amazing! My hubby and I always start with calamari and it never disappoints. I usually get the garlic noodles with chicken. It's full of butter and a decent amount of garlic. The chicken on it is always tender too! My hubby enjoys the burgers here because they're BIG!  I've never had the cheesecake here but my friends who have really enjoy it. My mama always spoils my brother with a slice when we go together.  I like that Cheesecake factory has a large food menu and a decent cocktail menu. It's nice to have a variety. I end up always getting the same thing though! It's so hard to choose. Whenever my hubby and I wanna treat ourselves for a hard week's work, we'll go here. The one bad thing about Cheesecake factory is the long wait.

But at lest I came when I was cutting carbs, so that did limit how much damage I could do. There was still somehow a 10 minute wait even at 8:30 PM on a Monday night- very odd. We were seated relatively quickly though, at a table with lackluster service- not at all on par with my expectations for this restaurant. BF's dad had the worst luck here- ordered a margarita that was 80% tequila, first time I've seen him not finish a drink in quite some time. He also opted for the chicken tortilla soup, which had only one flavor: spice. Literally seemed like mush accented with pepper. Sent it back to a baffled-looking waitress who couldn't seem to understand why anyone wouldn't love that soup. Did not taste like any other chicken tortilla soup we've ever had, and not in a good way. Also had the salmon wontons, which were just okay. BF's mom had the luau salad which was surprisingly vibrant and huge- I boxed leftovers up and took to work for lunch today. Salad usually doesn't save, especially not when dressed, but other than the crunchy bits being soggy, it held up relatively well. Lots of peppers and a delicious dressing, though I can't recall what it was called and it probably had more calories in it than anything else on the table. BF and I opted to share the tuna tartare small plate and the Boston salad with bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch- salad was by far my favorite, it was huge and had plentiful amounts of the assorted toppings, just wish it was tossed prior to arriving at the table, as it was so dark in our particular booth that we didn't figure it out for a few minutes. The tuna was just okay- BF seemed to like it more than I did, and I liked the marinade at the bottom, but just wasn't really my thing. We wrapped up the meal with a slice of the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, shared between the four of us and still deadly- and surprisingly delicious! Crust is made of a pecan sandie cookie, which sounds amazing because it is. Highly recommend that. Our waitress was MIA most of our visit and stopped by to check on us once. Drinks didn't get refilled and  table was cleared in an awkward and clumsy manner that seemed to indicate she was in a hurry to leave, even though we hadn't ordered dessert- and we had to prompt her for a dessert menu in the first place. Very odd for a place known for their desserts. Will come back because there's a million things on the menu, but hoping for better service next time.

Oliver L.,"San Francisco, United States",92,265,162,3.0,3/2/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of those restaurants that I've known of but never actually tried...until now. I ended up dropping by with a friend since we were in the area; we ended up waiting for around half an hour on a Saturday night, which wasn't too bad. The hostess did a good job of going through the line efficiently while still being polite. I was a bit astounded at the huge selection on the menu, but eventually settled on sharing the fried mac and cheese as an appetizer, and the Pasta Da Vinci. The mac and cheese was fairly hearty, although the center was still a bit lukewarm and not piping hot. The pasta dish had plenty of flavor and was actually quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, the heart attack-inducing portion sizes meant that I barely finished 1/5 of my main dish before admitting defeat. Definitely a very American-sized restaurant, both in terms of food and clientele, if you catch my drift. Sadly I was unable to try the namesake cheesecake for dessert.  Despite the restaurant being quite busy, our server was very attentive and friendly, popping up to refill waters and check on us periodically. She managed to remember small requests, like no ice in one of our waters, throughout our meal.

We were first in on Wed 11/26.  Our waitress? Did we disturb your 11am start of doing nothing until lunch? Or had you planned to sleep all day and were forced to work? Or you just have a bad attitude, period. Well, I was sick as a dog, but managed to continually be polite to you throughout your whole bad attitude. The food? HORRIBLE. H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E! Ordered the tortilla soup, the best word to describe it ""ewwwww"" completely inedible. It was like licking paprika off a spoon. Hubs order salmon, lemon, hubs can usually eat anything, this he did not finish.  We sat 20 mins after food served, no drink refill, then sat another 15 waiting for check. The restaurant was empty! Really? Do wait staff in the Bay Area need a GPS, or are we supposed to be feel entitled they're serving us? A little friendly and appreciative service is the difference between the $5 tip you get compared to the $50 we were willing to give. If it had been left up to me you would have got $0. The star is for the staff at the take out counter. We ordered a cheesecake for TG and they were very helpful and patient with choices and serving sizes.  No star for the cheesecake! Cheesecake Factory, what have you done to your cheesecakes? They taste bland and very uncreamy. Before they were rich and creamy, now they taste like sugar, thin sour cream and flavoring. And the cream used to be thick and OMG so good it should be illegal, but now tasteless and like regular whipping cream. :(",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=500

However I'm only giving this place 4 stars because the food is okay, nothing extraordinary and the service is a hit or miss. Came around 2 today and oh my, it was packed! Parking sucks as always and the wait usually are about 20 mins to an hour. Their portions are huge, I can never finish my food so if your appetite is small, I suggest sharing a dish or you can always take it home for later on. Their cheesecakes are pretty amazing, and again one slice can make me full.

The bartenders were super attentive taking our drink orders promptly and giving us the awesome bread which I absolutely love.  We didn't have dessert, but still had the bread.  Go figure.  I'd never ordered a sandwich here before so here's what I had: Southwest Chicken Sandwich: Grilled Chicken Breast, Crushed Avocado, Tomato, Onion, Cilantro, Jalapeño Peppers and Chipotle Mayo on a Toasted French Baguette The above was just cut and pasted from the menu which I do quite often here on yelp since it's hard for me to remember everything I ate.  In one word, it was ""Yum!"" The toasted french baguette was nice and crispy and soft on the inside.  The Chipotle Mayo had a nice kick it which wasn't super spicy but gave everything a nice flavor.  Everything else was just icing on the cake.  Grilled chicken was great and was so the crushed avocado.  You can never have enough cilantro in my opinion so having this in the sandwich was awesome too.   If I had to pick a sandwich I would get this again.  Next time I'm coming back for the cheesecake.  1300 calories a slice can just kiss my you know what.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=500

Alexander E.,"San Pablo, United States",355,636,830,4.0,4/1/2013,"It's pretty hard to resist The Cheesecake Factory. Who doesn't like to over indulge in classic American dishes? Followed with a 1,200 calorie dessert. It was Game 3 of the World Series and the Giants were out of town. We decided to visit The Cheesecake Factory and watch the game and get a bite to eat before heading over to the Winchester Mansion. The wait was surprisingly short, roughly 15 minutes or so on a Saturday afternoon.  The Cheesecake Factory menu is no piece of pie. That baby has about 12 pages of 2 person dishes, yet I had an idea of what I wanted to go with: Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It's never let me down, but once I looked at its nutrition content, I reconsidered. After poring over the menu, I finally decided on going with two items from the SkinnyLicious menu: Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos (Mexican); and Flatbread Pizza (Margherita).  The wrap tacos came out and were much bigger than I expected. A trio of butter lettuce leaves filed with chicken and stuffed with avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, roasted corn salsa, and crema. The tacos were a great choice but my only complaint were that they were difficult to handle. Additionally, one of the leaves was already ripped, which made everything fall out immediately. If you have trouble handling the tacos, you can easily make it into a small salad. As tasty as the tacos were, the flatbread pizza was even better. The portion was generous and larger than I expected. The crust was crispy without being burnt and the mozzarella, tomato, and basil all made for a freshly made (healthy) pizza.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with The Cheesecake Factory. The bar was a little busier than usual because of the World Series game, but other than that, it was pretty straight forward on getting a table; our waitress was friendly and gave great service, and the food was great. I would have loved getting my typical Crispy Chicken Sandwich, but I was in no position to break the calorie bank. If you're looking to eat healthy at The Cheesecake Factory, I suggest exploring the SkinnyLicious menu, as the two items I had were delicious, and there's even alcoholic drinks on the menu.,  Ambiance: 4 Stars (out of 5) Food: 4 Stars (out of 5) Service: 4 Stars (out of 5) Price: $$ Overall: 4 Stars (out of 5) Pros: + THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY + Large menu + New SkinnyLicious menu + Portions + Value + Location Cons: - Crowded at times",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=580

Gabrielle L.,"Pleasanton, United States",29,63,9,1.0,4/8/2015,"I'm really disappointed to be writing such a negative review because I've had wonderful experiences in other locations. This, though, was a total disaster. If there was an option for zero stars, I would give it.  Yes, the wait is long, but that is the case in pretty much every location anywhere close to a meal time. What was confusing about it, though, is that they give you the pager but when it goes off they just have you wait some more. When my party was called, there were so many people just standing around the front desk that it took us about forty five seconds to reach the desk, but by the time we got up there, the hostess had already crossed our names off and was calling the next group. Still, they took us, but it was another half hour after being seated that our server actually introduced herself and offered to bring water. I understand it was busy but we saw her only that one time before she asked us to order. So, we ordered drinks, appetizers, and our meals at the same time. We got our drink after about twenty minutes, but we got our bread at the same time the wrong appetizer arrived!! In the end we got our appetizer at the same time we got our meals. We had been sitting for almost two hours before we got our food.   My boyfriend said the fettuccine alfredo was just okay, and I thought that the shrimp scampi was about three stars. The sauce and the pasta were good but the shrimp was very, very chewy (overcooked or undercooked?). It wasn't bad so I didn't send it back or anything, although that wouldn't have been possible because we hadn't seen our server since we ordered.  When we were finished eating, I spoke to our server since it was my boyfriend's birthday and I asked what they could do and she said they give a little cup of ice cream and sing Happy Birthday, which sounded good to me. Well, they never did. There were at least three other birthdays in between the time I spoke to her and the time we left, including one at the next table over, but not for my guy. I felt really bad because this was the only thing we ended up being able to do for his birthday.  While we were eating, there was a particularly fussy toddler across the aisle from us who threw a bowl on the ground, and the hundreds of sharp little pieces hit myself and a few other people nearby, but no one came to clean anything up even though a few of us were sitting there with cuts all over our legs. Our area wasn't very clean at all, likely because they were trying to get people in an out as quickly as possible. There was a fork and napkin underneath our table and not until we received our check did anything off of our table get cleared.  In the end, I wish I'd given a smaller tip. I feel so, so bad that this went so horribly, because it was my boyfriend's birthday and we wanted to come here to celebrate.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=580

If you really love caesar salad, like I do, then you will probably enjoy it as well. Others, however, have complained that the dressing is too strong. If you like a bit more of a variety in your salads then you should probably get the cobb salad, which is also good and perhaps healthier.    I also enjoy their fried mac n cheese, stuff mushrooms, calamari, buffalo blast, garlic noodles, red velvet cheesecake, and pumpkin cheesecake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=580

Kimberly T.,"New York, United States",40,102,324,2.0,23/6/2013,"Disclaimer: this is only about the service, not the food. I am sure the food is wonderful.  I was planning a banquet for around 20 people and had one of my members call this location to try to reserve a table on a Monday night. They told him that while they did not do reservations past 5:30 or so, they were not busy on Monday nights and that they should be able to accommodate us easily.  Because they had reassured us that it would be fine, we decided to hold our banquet at The Cheesecake Factory. I told my entire group to meet there at 7. I got there 15 minutes early just in case. When I got there, however, I was informed that the wait time would be at LEAST an hour and a half. I informed them about what my member had been told, but they said that no one should ever have told us that since it was impossible to promise seating.  As if they thought that this was a viable solution, they told me that if I split up my banquet into 2 groups of 10, they could get us in within 45 minutes. Needless to say, you can't split up a banquet. And even if you could, that wait time is still way too long. The rest of my party arrived dressed nicely for a banquet but were unable to be seated until well after we were promised. This forced us to frantically call different restaurants in the area to see who could hold a party of 20 right at that moment with no reservation. Luckily, California Pizza Kitchen had just enough room, and we were able to walk there to hold our banquet.  Regardless though, Cheesecake Factory should not have made false assurances they couldn't keep. This is not a rant, but rather a reflection on how Cheesecake Factory could've easily ruined our end-of-the-year banquet simply because they tried to earn our business by saying they could seat us quickly, when they knew very well that they couldn't keep a promise like that.

I noticed that the cheesecake in the display outside had more options than what they had in the menu.  I tried ordering the Lemoncello cheesecake and our server kept wanting to give me the torte.  I ended up just getting a the white chocolate peanut butter cheesecake which was extremely rich.  I was also afraid of walking around the restaurant in fear of falling due to the ultra greasy floors.  The restrooms were completely atrocious.  There were two unwrapped toilet papers on the floor due to the fact that the rolls in the holders were empty.  I would have thought such a nice establishment would at least keep its restrooms clean. The Firecracker Salmon Rolls wasn't that spicy, but the sauce and cabbage was great garnish to eat.  The avocado roll was so full of avocados...I'm not a big avocado fan so if you like avocados go for this appetizer.  The dipping sauce was sweet and went perfectly with the roll. Overall, I only go here when my family goes since I would never go here on my own.  I really don't like cheesecake and would rather splurge on ice cream.  I also realized I do not like peanut butter in my desserts.  Just too salty and really puts an imbalance in my mouth.  Good to bring relatives I guess so that they can experience the glory that is cheesecake.  I'd rather drive to SF though or perhaps I should try the Stoneridge Mall's Cheesecake Factory.  It might be better than here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=840

Leslie H.,"Cupertino, United States",407,923,214,3.0,22/4/2012,"What should I expect? Well, an hour long wait for one thing. Actually, that's not too bad considering it was a Saturday evening, and we showed up around 6:15. I took a seat and settled in for some prime people watching. It seems like Cheesecake Factory appeals to all sorts of demographics. We saw ""Girls Night Out"" crews, families, prom goers, teenagers on group dates, pretty much everything. When you check in, the hostess gives you a pager and a time estimate, but don't stray too far because the pager only has a 30 foot range. I was told 45-50 minutes for the wait and given a pager with a detached capacitor. I wasn't fully convinced that it would buzz, so I just waited for my name to be called.  The Cheesecake Factory has a smart business model. Make people wait so they get hungry and then give them a massive menu with a huge number of choices. I'm not sure why a typical pasta dish costs upwards of $15, but their portion sizes sure are huge. I've really enjoyed their chicken Madeira and chicken Marsala as well as their various pasta dishes in the past, but I just can't bring myself to shell out so much anymore, so I usually go with their crispy chicken sandwich. It's a chicken breast that's battered and fried, then topped with a slice of cheese, a slice of cheese, one measly slice of tomato, and a bunch of shredded lettuce. You'd think a place like The Cheesecake Factory that would charge $12 for a sandwich could at least use whole pieces of lettuce, but no. It doesn't even come with onion or a pickle! But it's still one of the cheaper items on the menu. It also comes with fries. I used to really enjoy their shoestring fries, but they seemed to have switched to thicker cut ones. One thing I will give them is that their chipotle mayo and their ranch dressing are darn tasty. I did greatly enjoy our white chocolate blueberry cheesecake yesterday, but I did also balk at the $6.95 price tag. Oh well, you kind of get what you expect and are willing to pay for when you come to The Cheesecake Factory. Typically, I would say I won't be back, but this being the popular dining spot that it is, it's likely that I will return.

Lisa L.,"San Jose, United States",0,4,,1.0,3/11/2015,"We went to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate a birthday, and we had a good size party. It seemed to be slow night, it took an hour to get our food. When we did finally get our food, half of it was cold, he had to ask for refills on our drinks. My kids ended up not even eating because of the wait, they were full on bread. When we got my daughters order of chicken sliders, it should have been with fruit not fries, it took them 15 minutes to bring her some fruit that looked like it was cut up for a baby(pieces the size of the end of your pinky). Since it took so long to get our food I thought it was a good idea when our food came out to place my To Go order for my spouse at home, so the order would be out in time. We waited another hour for my to go order. When I asked about the 4 times, he said "" He was waiting for the order"", then "" He was looking for the order"", then "" They didn't bring it out"" and last "" Oh it was sitting up there waiting for you to tell me you are ready"". I proceeded to check my food, the chicken and mashed potatoes where cold. I told the server this and he said "" I can have it warmed up for you"", I told him I could do that at home.  When I asked for a manager it took her 15 minutes to get back to me. My family was waiting outside since she said she would be right back.  Needless to say the birthday dinner for horrible from the bad service to the cold food and all around horrible customer service.

We wanted to fill up a little bit since none of us ate lunch, but we didn't want to have to unbutton as soon as we were in the car and no one was looking. As you can imagine, we were delighted to see that there was a 'small plates and snacks' menu. :) To eat, we ordered: - Greek Salad (standard) - Tex Mex Eggrolls (not really my thing, but always a hit with friends) - Shrimp Scampi Crostini (sooo yummy, but sooo small) To drink, we ordered: - Lemon Drop Martini (idk how, but it got my friend super tipsy...FAST) - Typhoon Punch ( tasty and does its job well) - Factory Peach Bellini (fun and tasty, but not hard) We followed with:  - White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake (i died) I ordered to-go: - Red Velvet Cheesecake (my hot little love interest completely devoured it before I could even get to it) Great food, great drinks, great service...

Came here yesterday with my family of 5 as a pre surprise for my 40th birthday.  After a long day of work and  a beautiful day in the sun and school for my children. My wife dicided to surprise me and my 3 daughters for a night to unwind and dinner free household. there wasn't a wait we were so lucky we were led to a table. What was weird was as we were walking pass 3 available table that I  thought could hold 5 ppl we were led to the back near the restroom? As we came close my wife was maybe a mind reader she also was thinking what i was thinking and decided to voice her opinion so we were re-directed back to the front. Right here I already had a strike on the service and basically played along with the night. Little that they know I'm a critic and a very voiceful  individual when service are not perform to the satisfaction.    When we were seated, I found our waitress wasn't  friendly at all from the beginning. No smile, no welcoming and compassionate vibe was coming out of her personality. As I glanced across the section where we were sitting i seen a friendlier waiter doing his job with another guest properly. so I said oh my!  So to make a long story short we got our food. We didn't get any comments how was our food nor are water glass and refreshment wasn't being service when they were empty. Oh get this I hated to seeing waiters and waitress watching me eat as they stand right across of me waiting for guest or they just didn't have anything to do. So honestly this visit was a total waste of time and effort and I really don't understand why big chain restaurants are beginning to fail in there customer satisfaction report card? Don't they know we as the customer is the bread and butter of the restaurants flourish to shine?

I decided to pick up the food with another co-worker since CF does not have delivery and the food is cheaper. They go through a third party vendor,  , to deliver the food.   is a rip off as each dish is a couple dollars more, and there is a 15% drivers fee (excluding the delivery fee). Since our food was over $1400, the driver's fee could have been easily $200. Anyway, I called the restaurant on Friday morning for pick up on Monday at 11:30am. The event started at 12:15pm, so there was plenty of time. When we arrived at 11:30am, the food was not ready. We waited 30 minutes for the food to be brought out. Yeah ... at 12pm!!! The restaurant should have done that at 11am and not at 11:30am when it was the pick up time. The lady who had the receipt made sure that all the food was brought out and she didn't even apologize for bringing out the food. By the time we got back to the office, it was well past 12:15pm, and we had to set up the food. How unprofessional. I would NOT recommend having you pick up your catering food at Cheesecake Factory. It is not worth the hassle. At the end of the day, I guess   was worth the additional money and lack of stress.

Rei P.,"San Jose, United States",0,11,6,3.0,13/11/2012,"I loved Cheesecake Factory. The first time I came here I was in awe of all the food choices and just couldn't get enough of coming back. My sisters and I made this our go to restaurant. That is why I am incredibly sad to say that this is probably no longer the case. I understand that prices have to go up, and I don't mind that if the portion size stays the same. Unfortunately, Cheesecake Factory has raised their prices and made their portions a lot smaller than what I remember. My favorite dishes were the shepherds pie and the lemon herb roasted chicken, and I would alternate between getting these all the time. The shepherds pie used to be covered with potatoes completely so that I couldn't see the beef underneath, but it seems the potatoes on top just keep getting smaller and the price has risen $2-$3. The same goes with the lemon herb roasted chicken's price. The chicken pieces they gave used to be huge and the sauce was so flavorful, but the past few times I've ordered it, the chicken was small and the sauce too watery or none at all. I still love their cheesecakes though. Most of the time the servers are good enough, but when I went with my sister on Sunday it seemed that our waitresses(there were 2) forgot about us and another person actually noticed us just sitting there and offered to pack our food for us.

Warren W.,"Burlingame, United States",412,233,85,5.0,20/7/2009,"As a former Cheesecake Factory employee and frequent patron, I just had to drop a line, especially with the insider info yo. #1 - your experience is at the utter mercy of your server 100%. It makes or breaks everything. For that reason, I'll wait 2 hours for a hella bomb server that I know and have worked with. In case you're not so patient (haha), you can grab seats at the bar. The bartenders are hella cool, chances are you'll see Sam or Jeff or this other pinay hottie whose name escapes me right now lol.  You also grab the high top tables beside the bar area. Those are totally up for grabs. A complete free-for-all so during busy nights, you can just hover around there and wait for a free table. Skip the entire line that way. ;) But yea man, like the Cheesecake Factory is one of the best places to go, definitely one of the highest bang for buck places for sure. I DARE YOU NOT TO HAVE LEFT-OVERS lol. ALmost impossible.  Try: -Miso Salmon -Bang bang chicken & shrimp -Chicken Marsala -Da Vinci Pasta -Laua Salad Like your drinks?? dude: -ultimate margarita (prepare yourself) -georgia peach (great girly drink lol) -MOJITOS! (dang, love that mint. they make it hella bomb too) -Arnold Palmers, love that sugar rim on the glass.  Appetizers!!!! --- my fav part -AVOCADO EGG ROLLS (i swear by these) -SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES  I love those two appetizers TO DEATH.  If you don't like them... shoot..... I'll buy you a slice of cheesecake or something lol.  Cheesecake! Ahahaaa... (use to work in the bakery mwahaha) -GOdiva. 4 kinds of chocolate. dense as hell. more calories, sugar, carb than a big mac =D -Chocolate Tuxedo. it is THE coolest looking cheesecake. mix of dark and white chocolates, insanely cool decor on the plate, trust me -White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle - one of the bestsellers for a reason -REgular Cheesecake/ REg + strawberry - the classic -Turtle Pecan - my personal favorite, very rich rich, creamy =) -Vanilla Bean - a twist on the vanilla flavor with the richness that ice cream has never captured, you will be very pleasantly surprised THere's almost 50 slices and I've tried them all. They're all good.  If you got a big appetite and you're ambitious as hell.... try the dessert of the gods: Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake. [you will die.] Craig's Carrot Cake is hella insane too.  AND of course,  your meal always comes with bread at the beginning.  FYI, that brown bread is not chocolate bread lol It's wheat baguette, hella bomb. =) You can ask for as much as you want! Hey, enjoy your meal =D If you're there on weekday nights/weekend nights and you want the best server in the house, ask to sit in Marcel's section. Tell him Warren sent ya. ;) He'll take care of you yo.  Just celebrated my 6 month anniversary with my girl and this guy made our dinner absolutely... indescrible.

Robert K.,"San Jose, United States",141,437,196,3.0,24/8/2009,"Yet another semi mediocre review for Cheesecake Factory. Unlike other businesses, this place survives not on repeat business but on the fact that they have an amazing location, great decor, are open late, are HUGE, and have a huge menu.   That being said I always find myself going here despite the fact that the food isn't really all that great.  Their 20 page menu has so much to choose from and I've had quite a few dishes there and it seems to get worse and worse.  It's just really a bad attempt at fusion and it mostly comes out Americanized, no matter what the dish, and it seems like it's all microwaved and thrown together.  Not good. The bar is nice though and yes the deserts are pretty good, too.   The new red velvet cheesecake is the best desert I've ever had, period.  It's 1550 or so calories too, FYI! I'd also like to point out that a manager told me that this particular cheesecake will be around for a while because ""it'd be a bad business decision to get rid of it since it's so popular.""  So, not because it's great, but because they're making money off it.  Haha.  And then he said ""it has too much frosting for me personally""     I LOVE that he said that, it's nice to get honesty out of someone who works in the restaurant industry.  It's very rare, trust me.. Oh and another funny note is that they offer no entertainment for kids.  We once asked for a piece of paper for our daughter to draw on and they just gave me a stub of receipt paper.  I thought that was funny and I actually like the idea of shunning children and making it not kid friendly, haha",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=900

I like to go to mom n pop style places or dives, diners and such or food trucks and stalls but this is one of my bf's favorite restaurant so I came here. What we had: Chicken madiera- This was good, I liked it but the taste didn't really surprise me it just wasn't very unique, the madiera sauce somehow tasted a little bit like hoisin. It was good nevertheless so this is definitely a must try. Pina colada- it came out too icy and lacked flavor, i like the pina colada at elephant bar better and even that pina colada i had at dave and busters dulce de leche cheesecake- it was at least not too sweet cause some of the cheesecakes here are too sweet and it was good it's just that I know the difference with the taste of home made cheesecake than massively produced cheesecakes. The best cheesecake I've had was at broken record and the white christmass cheesecake dome at cheesecake etc in the philippines OMG that was amazing. Calamari- Good and the squid was fresh but our calamari was lukewarm as if it had been fried beforehand. The best calamari I've had is still in pier 39 in embarcadero. Moving on, my bf had the chicken bowtie pasta thing I forgot what it was called, it looked good and tasted alright. Here's what I think: 1.They have this strategy of making people wait, there were a lot of empty seats and I'm not very sure if it's because they have a special ritual before they seat you but my gut tells me it's a marketing strategy to make people think they are always packed and of course to make you hungry. 2.I actually feel sorry for the utensils here, they are basically mutilated, there are scratches here and there and you can see the dried up water on the spoons and fork. I think everything accounts to appetite, how you eat in your house is also your attitude when you eat out. I take food seriously and cleanliness too nothing just makes you wanna eat more than nice clean utensils. 3. There's definitely something about the portion sizes, I would expect to have big servings like most places like these offer but the are kinda lacking in that area. Conclusion: Would I come back? Yes, not soon but yes. This place is alright.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=900

I tasted the pasta and it was still cold and there was chunks of cheese everywhere in the dish. So I sent it back for them to reheat my dish. When they brought back my dish it looked like they gave me a brand new plate of pasta. They didn't take out the ricotta and it looked like they only gave me half of my portion. Weird because I only took a bite of my dish before I sent it back. There was more cheese than pasta. When I tasted it, the pasta was still cold to warm. Ehh it was whatever to much.

I usually don't get the pasta, but I'm sure that's not whats supposed to be in it.   We immediately informed the waiter and the manager personally came out to apologize, comp my meal, and gave me a house salad on the house (although I wish she gave me cheesecake!).  I was impressed with the manager coming out to take care of everything herself.   Generally, I think Cheesecake is overrated, but after this incident I have mixed feelings about specifically eating at the one in vf.  I liked the professionalism and treatment I got when we reported the hair, but in a nice place like Cheesecake, there really shouldn't be one in the first place.   On a happier note, the food tastes good.  I like getting the miso salmon and replacing the rice with mashed potatoes.  By far, the BEST dessert is the RED VELVET cheesecake!  Red velvet + cheesecake= :D  It was GENIUS to combine the two.  Absolutely scrumptious.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=900

diana r.,"San Jose, United States",176,301,10,4.0,11/4/2012,"Coming to the Cheesecake Factory is defiantly asking for trouble.  I mean, going to the Cheesecake Factory and not having cheese cake is like going to Paris and not going to the Eiffel Tower.   This place has everything, from healthy salads to not so healthy cheeseburgers and fries and the portions are pretty generous.  I have visited this location several times and thankfully this last time I went there was no wait, however be aware that on weekends this place is packed and the wait to be seated can easily be over an hour.  Its a little loud inside so not the best place to have a nice long conversation, but a great place to enjoy some good food and cheese cake. I think the highlight of this visit was my red velvet cheesecake.... OMG... to die for.  A friend and I split one (good idea).  Very yummy, I could defiantly taste the red velvet and the cheese cake.  Great combination.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=900

Haha..our meal today was: 0: my pomegranate margarita blended- it was a good kick of tequila - tiny bit on the salty side but I still sipped it all - numbering 0 because it wasn't food - hehe :P 1: Fried calamari - hubby was craving this one today and although wr've had better, it satisfied his craving 2: Spinach and Artichoke dip with chips - it's just the right amount of cheese and goo served warm dipped with a tortilla chip is a must have for me! Loved it! 3: sweet corn tamale with toppings on the side - for me little bubba, toppings consists of salsa, sour cream and avocado chunks - he doesn't care for the sour cream and salsa but loved the avocado chunks with his sweet corn tamales! 4: small plates fried artichoke hearts - it was perfect! Delicious crunchy on the outside and healthy on the inside! Yummy goodness! 5: Classic fresh strawberry cheesecake to share - it really doesn't get better than that! Food Service was on point today, the wait was bad but not brutal for a 6:15 on a Saturday night - quote was 10-15 but we waited 25-30 mins for a table.

There was a small line huddled around the dessert counter, which was a brightly lit display fridge housing an array of delectable cheesecakes to choose from. Decisions, decisions...Some of the cakes were even cut open so you could see the tempting layers on the inside, which was how the Red Velvet lured us in.  The wait was no more than a few minutes, as two staff members took orders while a third packed up slices to go. When we got home, we broke open the box and delved into the delicious wedge of Heaven. The cake was tiered, alternating between creamy white cheesecake and spongey red velvet cake. When we reached what would have been the crust if I were describing a pie, we got a mouthful of crisp, white chocolate shavings pressed into the frosting.  We washed each bite down with hot gulps of coffee.

From the gorgeous cheesecakes to the lip-smacking main course, this is a great place to dine for all occasions.  You will need a bit of patience as the wait time could be around 45 minutes just to be seated. It is worth the wait if you ask me because I simply love the food here.The serving portion is big enough for leftovers. The menu is impeccable. With a wide assortment to choose from and most of the choices excellent, my favorites include the chicken samosas, hot spinach and cheese dip and factory nachos for appetizers that are all must try items for anybody. Also love the club sandwich which is a good portion.  There is an varied list of delicious pastas and the best I've had are fettuccine Alfredo and shrimp with angel hair.  Also try their seafood options of shrimp scampi and the finest of all is the Jamaican black pepper shrimp served with rice, black beans and fried plantains along with spicy black pepper shrimp and a mango salsa. I also like the tropical smoothie to go with this and don't forget the cheesecakes for desert.  Dig into the ultimate red velvet cheesecake or tiramisu or take some home for later if you are stuffed.

Finally after waiting for an hour and a half, we complained and the manager, Marsha came out and said it was their fault that they got our name mixed up with some other party's and that now we were going to have to wait additional time for another large table to open!

I ended up with enough pasta to feed a family of four in a very greasy sauce that tasted of hickory smoke flavoring.  And that's pretty much all it tasted of.  The flavors of the chicken and green peas that were included in the dish were overpowered.  The Key Lime Cheesecake that I ordered for dessert tasted, and had the consistency of, Key Lime Pie.  If there was any cream cheese used I'd be surprised. The teenagers enjoyed their food (Mini Hot Dogs and Four Cheese Pasta) but then they also eat things like Sour Gummy Worms.

We always passed by I'd just start craving their food. Honestly I've only had their burgers and the Miso Salmon, but that's all the I need when I come here.  First of all, the host walked my friend and I to our table which was in a nice corner of the restaurant. It was a Friday afternoon so there wasn't that much people inside. Anyways, the restaurant has this nice atmosphere; not too bright and not too dark and the music wasn't loud and in the way. It was perfect background music to my friend and I's conversations.  After much consideration, we ordered our food. I think my friend thought I was rushing her, but that wasn't the case. Just interested in what she would decide on eating. So I got the Miso Salmon of course and my friend got the Pasta Da Vinci. While we waited we were given complimentary bread and we just talked until our food arrived which didn't seem to long.  The Miso Salmon is so good. I always loved the presentation with a single slab of salmon over rice covered in the sweet miso sauce. Sweet, but that salty fish taste is a great compliment to the overall dish. The salmon was easy take into with small bites and by the end I was as satisfied with the taste from the beginning to the last bite. The proportion was perfect, because it didn't leave me full and bloated, but full enough that I left satisfied.  The Pasta Da Vinci was pretty good as well. I had a small bite, but not enough to really divulge myself in its taste. Cheesecake factory is always a great place to go with a friend, or even a large group, or on dates.

There is nothing bad about this place, but also nothing super amazing, except the cheesecakes of course! On the weekends this place is usually packed, but any other day it's pretty empty. The service here is decent, the atmosphere is great, and the food, well it can be a hit or miss sometimes. First I would just like to make a comment on the cost of the food, yes it is pretty pricey if you think about it. 16-20 dollars for pasta? But then again the portions are huge! The portions are slightly larger then BJ's if you have ever been there. A entree of pasta could easily feed two people(depending on the person you share with of course). Also the pasta here isn't too bad. At times the pasta can be full of flavor and at other times it could be bland. The dishes I had with my group was the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Pasta Da Vinci, and Steak Diane. To start off the meal of course we had fried calamari and artichoke dip. Let's just say, I had better fried calamari at many other places. The calamari here was a bit bland and sometimes a bit too soggy. The artichoke dip here is very decent. In my opinion it doesn't match up with Red Robins or Chili's artichoke dip as they have better chips and more flavor in the dip itself. The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta on the other hand was pretty good. It had a small kick to it with a lot of flavors, and also the portion was huge. My friend couldn't finish it, so we all had to help him finish. On the side note though, I had this entree multiple times, and it could be pretty bland sometimes with no taste, besides the taste of pepper. The Pasta Da Vinci on the other hand was amazing. It was my first time getting it. The sauce had a unique flavor of onions and mushrooms. The only way I can describe it is like eating pasta with the In N Out thousand island sauce.

My friend and I came here before studying (but obviously that didn't work out) and we ordered the exact same thing. They have two of my favorite dishes as a combo so making up my mind was easy easy! It was a steak diane paired with their chicken masala dish. Match made in heaven! We ordered a few cocktails but they were incredibly weak. I wasn't looking to get plastered or anything but a little kick would have been nice. They honestly tasted like virgin blended drinks. mehs. I'll pass next time. I always save room for cheesecake.

The GF got a spicy jambalaya dish and I got the factory burger with a salad. I also saved room for a piece of low-carb cheesecake which was pretty satisfying.

First we tried to call in advance hours earlier to let them know when we would be there and they insisted that we could not make a reservation even though we had a huge party so we said fine we will just come in. A few of us arrived earlier than others to check in our party and they told us it would be about an hour wait so we waited and then they gave away our table because 80% of our party had not arrived yet, we said fine. What really got to us was when we waited another 30 minutes and when we asked how much longer we were informed that they gave away our table again! They didn't even check in with us to see if the rest of our party had arrived and at the point we were only waiting on two people so yes 80% of our party was there. When I complained to the manager (Marsha) she said oh well you'll have to wait another 45 min! I told her that she was unprofessional and this was rediculous. We called California Pizza Kitchen and they said they would be able to seat us right away.

Stanley C.,"San Jose, United States",791,655,2706,5.0,3/9/2011,"CHEESECAKE FACTORY One of the staples of American dining at various shopping malls, Cheesecake Factory offers a huge menu of delicious eats, ranging from pasta to seafood to poultry/steak, salad, and of course... cheesecake. Their cheesecake is world-renowned and comes in many flavors that is sure to satisfy anyone and everyone. Some of my favorite dishes: (1) Pecan-Crusted Catfish: with Mashed Potatoes and sweet corn (2) Seared Tuna Tataki Salad: Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared and Served Rare with Avocado, Tomato and Mixed Greens Tossed with Wasabi Vinaigrette. (3) Pasta Carbonara: Spaghettini with Smoked Bacon, Green Peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce. Available with Chicken.  Cheesecake: (1) Blueberry Cheesecake - lots of blueberry flavor, although a bit too sweet (2) Mango/Key Lime Cheesecake - smooth and silky The dishes are all quite large, so you certainly won't leave the restaurant hungry. The cheesecake slices are heaven so satisfy your sweet tooth! The serving staff is ultra friendly and even sing you a Happy Birthday song if it's your special day.  Drawback: no reservations are taken at Cheesecake Factory, so it's a hit or miss depending on when you come. If it's a large party, be prepared to wait a long long long time!

I ordered the spaghetti with marinara sauce expecting overcooked pasta with icky sauce (because thats usually what happens at chain places like this) but I was pleasantly surprised. The pasta was well cooked and the sauce had the right balance of salty and sweet. 4 stars for sure. For dessert I ordered a slice of key lime cheesecake and it was delicious.  The birthday girl got a free sunday on which the waitress had written ""Happy Birthday Megan."" Nice touch!

We met with another pal on this last Sunday and it was pretty busy. The thirty minute wait wasn't terrible. The decor is nice: it's airy, dim, and marble-y. You could bring a date here without seeming as though you were being presumptuous, while still leaving the option for romance... on the table. ;o) When we were sat, Annie was breaking our server, Dan. Service was very efficient and personable. Annie felt like somebody who should sit down and join us girls. My Manhattan was tasty and was promptly served. My BFF seemed pretty darn happy with her Lemon Drop. She and I have a perfect arrangement where we share a miso glazed salmon with brown rice, which leaves almost enough room for a nibble of cheesecake. Our other friend was craving a small bite, but this is NOT the place to find, well anything, small... really. I think the richness of everything overwhelmed her. The cheesecake is just too darn sweet! And it has WAY too much whipped cream.  Anyway, CF is more like a 3.5 star place. Decor and service is higher. I quite like the salmon and I'll be back with my friend time and again, I'm sure. I'm just not confident that it deserves four stars.

This place has one of the biggest menus you have ever seen. You'd think that somewhere in this ""War and Peace"" of menus you'd be able to find something excellent. But no you won't be finding anything better than decent. I've tried too many things on this menu to list here because some of my friends seem to think that the food is worth anyones taste buds. Every time I get something new because it's never that good.  It's also about $4 more for plate than it should be. Mix the meh food and the new hole in your pocket and it equals a bad time.  Furthermore they don't take reservations and often are incredibly full. The wait is usually forever.  BUT the cheesecake! Yeah it's really good! Much like with the food I've tried oh so many flavors. But this time I have to say there is the opposite result. Everything is good. The cheesecake is just so rich and the crust so perfect. It's not even worth describing. You just have to try it to understand.  Once again it's pretty pricey but I think it's worth it. After all, you shouldn't eat a slice of this very often because with great taste comes great amounts of calories. But hey you should be able to splurge from time to time.  So do yourself a favor.

This time I ordered the bacon BBQ burger and for some reason it really didn't have much taste. How can that be? It was plain. the fries were okay but seriously the best thing about my meal was the free bread that they give you. Even my drink was watery-it was a soda... Last time I came here I got the Hibachi Steak that i have had before at other cheesecakes- this one was not good. Bits of the steak was hard and it made me feel so sick later on.  THe only redeeming factor was the service. She was spectacular and kept coming back to make sure we had everything we needed. I'm pretty sure she asked if we wanted more soda like 3 times... which is pretty unheard of.  I used to think coming here was a huge treat but now I'm not so sure.

Absurd.  Like any other chain restaurant, I try to avoid Cheesecake Factory as much as possible (not because I don't like it, but there's just SO many other local businesses I'd rather support first). The great thing about CF is that the portions are gimongulous and actually worth what you pay for. I'll admit, a few dishes can be a bit steep, but nothing too extraordinary for the most part.

I come often for either cheesecake, lunch, or dinner.  Some of my favorite pasta dishes are: four cheese pasta, pasta da vinci (my usual choice), Louisiana chicken pasta, and fettuccine Alfredo. Of all the steaks I do like their Steak Diane. It's well marinated, juicy, and not over done. The portion is just right that is if you will be having appetizers and dessert. I've tried their filet mignon and was very disappointed. The steak was over done and charred, definitely not how a steak should be! My favorite appetizers are: Fried Calamari, fried mac and cheese, and fire cracker salmon rolls. Of all their choices I found those to be more pleasant. Don't bother with their crabcakes, they were salty, mushy, and wasn't done right. Last but not least, their cheesecake!!

Our beeper never went off.. My boyfriend and I were tired of the anticipation for a vibration (no pun intended) that we went to the front desk and asked why it took such a long time.  They apologized and seated us immediately after that.  The pastas are all good. I'm pretty sure that if you order any kind, you'll enjoy them. The bread is always warm and endless! One of the reasons I love coming here.  The service was just right. They gave us enough attention and were not too bothersome at times either. I hate going to places where they constantly ask if our meals is ok.. Maybe I should start eating it first before you choke me with questions!!

Che H.,"Campbell, United States",3,8,,1.0,23/11/2011,"Went there the other night with my cousin and his wife who had both flown in from out of town. Dinner was alright ... nothing spectacular. But here's the kicker; we were presented with a bill and paid it. A few minutes later the server came over and profusely apologized that they had made a mistake on our bill. At one point saying that she didn't even think that it was ours. She said that she didn't want us to have to pay for something that wasn't ours. Sounds reasonable. The manager then came by and apologized too and promised to clear things right up. However we noticed that while the server and manager made it sound like they were doing us a favor, they never came out and said what the bill discrepancy was. We started getting suspicious. Sure enough when we got the bill it was $4 higher than the previous bill. Now $4 isn't much money. And it represents less than 1% of the total bill. But on the flip side $4 IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY! They probably spent more than $4 in labor going through the whole process of adjusting the bill. It came off as cheap and petty. And worse it came off as disingenuous. They played coy making it sound like they were doing us a favor but the whole time they were covering their butts over a $4 difference. Of course I lowered my tip amount so my total payment was the same as before the adjustment was made. Basically the server got penalized. Here's a tip to anyone at CF that might be reading: good customer service means that after the bill is presented to the customer you only adjust it one way ... down in the customer's favor. If the restaurant makes a mistake that costs them money then they should 1) tell the customer and 2) EAT THE COST OF THE MISTAKE! Telling the customer sets future expectations that the price won't always be this good. Eating the cost of the mistake gives the restaurant an oppurtunity to look magnanimus and instills a feeling in the customer that the establishment cares more about them then profit. Even if this isn't true, it's the customer perception that matters here. In this case CF just looks stupid (for making a $4 mistake) and petty (for making me pay for it). I'll never go back to The Cheesecake Factory again ... and neither should you!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1060
Mikey T.,"Anaheim, United States",211,49,4,2.0,6/1/2012,"Last year, after finding out how unhealthy it is, I vowed never to eat at another Cheesecake Factory again. Yesterday, I broke that vow. Okay, seriously: I'm not the most health-conscious person, and a couple times a week I'll find myself eating out and indulging in a fat burger or some lobster or something, but Cheesecake Factory is downright deadly. I decided to look up the nutrition facts of their menu one day - BIG mistake. A good 2/3rds of the menu contains an ungodly amount of calories and saturated fat, more than any person should eat in one sitting. That said, I was with a friend and we were both extremely fatigued from a long day of shopping and walking, and we also both had CF gift cards, so we decided to settle. Our food, however, did not. Even as I'm sitting here on my bed, typing away on my laptop, a good 11 hours after eating, I still feel it sitting there in my stomach, slowly clogging my arteries. I feel fat just typing this review. And it's not only the healthiness (or lack thereof) of the food that left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended), it's also...well, the bad taste. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci; sounds refined, right? Not exactly. The pasta was undercooked, I only received a few skimpy pieces of dry chicken, and the entire dish was lathered with more sauce than it needed. It felt like I was eating a slightly-upscale version of a microwave dinner.  I will say this: the brown bread that they have is absolutely DELICIOUS. And it's not bad for your health, either...well, because it's just bread. As far as this particular location goes, there's ample seating (boothes, tables, high-chairs and a bar area) and the staff is courteous and highly attentive, checking in with us to make sure that we had everything that we needed. This was a pleasant surprise for me; being a young adult, I find that many times, servers do not pay as much attention to me as they do to older customers. Although I certainly don't need any extra attention, its always a nice gesture to receive some. Hey - just because I'm young doesn't mean I don't know how to give a tip when I feel that it is deserved (and I did tip, generously, in this case).  All ranting aside, if it weren't for the outstanding customer service, that scrumptious brown bread, and the good company that I was with, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this night as much as I did.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=980

Bianca L.,"San Jose, United States",275,96,37,4.0,1/10/2010,"After last night, I've concluded that you will never know what kind of service you're going to get. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to be greeted by a host who was all smiles and talkative. The same goes for our waiter who had been working there for 5+ years.  Normally, I would experience a waiter who neglects my table while treating their other tables wonderfully (possibly bc I look like I'm 13 and assume I don't tip well? idk), but this waiter really knows how to take care of his guests.  I ordered the shrimp scampi and my boyfriend ordered the Shrimp BLT. We also got the new cheesecake--Reeses Peanut Butter Cheesecake. Shrimp Scampi: For all you shrimp lovers..if you've never tried this, you are missing out! They give about 6 or 7 pieces of Jumbo shrimp that are lightly battered and seasoned perfectly, adorned on top of a pile of angel hair pasta. The sauce is delectable and our waiter even gave us extra sauce on the side, without me having to ask! (+++!) Shrimp BLT: Once crowned the worst, most unhealthiest sandwich ever! BUT its soo soo good. I love BLT sandwiches, but throw some shrimp in there--I'm sold! Reeses Peanut Butter Cheesecake: From what our waiter told us, this is their newest addition. I'm glad that they collaborated and made this beautiful piece of cheesecake. It definitely taste like a peanut butter cup. I have an exceptionally big sweet tooth so this is definitely not for those who aren't a fan of sweets nor for those watching their sugar intake. Overall, I had a great experience here. The bottomless bread basket is superb, the food was wonderful, and the service was great. I guess I'll have to cross my fingers and hope I get the same great service the next time around.  Ps.

Tiffany H.,"San Jose, United States",219,304,168,4.0,17/10/2010,"My mom and I were already at Valley Fair when we started to get really hungry. We decided to eat here since it was the closes restaurant we would actually eat at next to Valley Fair. Came in got seated in less then 5 minutes. Did I mention this was a Wednesday night. If it wasn't we probably would have had to wait for hours. Due to the time, which we came at around 8pm. I love the brown bread they give here. I hate the white bread it's to hard.  For our starter we got the buffalo wings. 3.5 stars. They were tasty and for 2 people it was a fair amount. My mom and I have a big appetite. As my entree I got the Charbroiled Flat Iron Steak cooked medium rare. LOVED IT. I love the way the steak is cooked and the sauce that's it's drench in. The way it was marinated was perfect for my taste buds. 5 stars for the steak! My mom got noodles with meat sauce and sausage. It's not on the menu she kind of created her own pasta. (I didn't know you can do that) I can't review on what she got because, I didn't eat it myself.  For our dessert we got the Red Velvet Cheesecake and we ordered 2 scoops of Vanilla ice cream on the side of that. You can never go wrong with Red Velvet but, it gets a little too sweet after awhile and you just want to stop eating it. The vanilla ice cream really helped eased the sweetness of the Red Velvet/Cheese. Pretend Vanilla ice cream is milk, and you'll get what I am talking about. I will give this dessert 4 stars.

It does indeed have something for everyone.  I had a avacado-filled eggroll (how do they DO that?!) that was marvelous, along with a corn fritter.  My entree was the most beautiful barbeque chicken salad.  It was nicely dressed (equally throughout the entire salad) and beautifully presented.  It was waaaaay to big to eat in one sitting, they cheerfully boxed it up for me. I ordered the raspberry white-chocolate cheesecake, so that I could take something home to Dr. R..  It was very sweet and very good.  I had a bite of the red-velvet cheesecake (ok, two bites), purely for research purposes.  That was very, very good also. Service was very solicitous.  Sodas were refilled promptly, our entrees all came at the same time and were exactly as ordered.  I was very impressed by the legion of wait-staff.  They took very good care of our group of eleven people.

K T.,"San Jose, United States",0,11,,5.0,8/10/2014,"We dine here at the Santa Clara, CA location a few times throughout the year but specifically come for our daughters' birthdays as The Cheesecake Factory is their favorite restaurant. However we always forget to call ahead to have their birthday cheesecake/dessert defrosted before coming every year for each birthday event. This time, I made certain to call ahead and Francine, front end greeter did an amazing job. I could hear in the background it was very busy. She still managed to help me by asking if she could put me on hold so she could run to their bakery to find out what cheesecakes were available and in what sizes. When she came back I had another question for her in which she politely asked if she could call me back as she was going to be off in another half hour and would then be able to better assist me. What a wonderful employee to spend her nonworking unpaid time to help me with my question which was pricing on the cakes. She indeed called me back with the cake prices and additionally gave me some great news that she had spoken with the manager and they could give me a reservation for our dinner party since they don't normally do reservations after 5pm (we were coming at 7:30pm and taking our chances walking in.) She also made sure that two of her associates knew that we were coming, had a cake reserved and set out to be defrosted and that I would be bringing in candles.  When we got there, everything was taking care of as promised and even our server, Justin was already briefed on everything. He tended to our table exceptionally well, always cheerful and made sure we were happy and had everything we needed. We tried new dishes and they were all amazing and delicious. The dinner servings were as usual, very generous and everyone had enough leftovers for a full meal to eat the next day...really it was that much food! We also love how they write Happy Birthday on the plate that holds the cheesecake. A big THANK YOU and KUDOS to everyone involved especially Francine and Justin. After our dinner I made sure to speak with Mandy, the restaurant manager to let her know how thankful and impressed we were with both Francine and Justin and that although Francine had already gone home, we wanted the manager to know how much we appreciated her employees' professionalism and attentiveness to our needs.

The upsides: huge menu, good service (usually), yummy and fresh food and, of course, CHEESECAKE!!

There's not much seating in the waiting area either so after 20min of standing around packed body to body and staring at the back of the person's head in front of you, you'll more than likely start feeling emo. I sure as hell did. I'm not sure why my immediate family or all the other people standing around aimlessly waiting choose to endure the long wait times. Note to self: demand a change in restaurants for family reunion dinners. Food isn't great but it's not bad either, some dishes are hit or miss but overall it's standard fare and any choice should be pretty solid on their huge menu. There isn't really a list of recommendations for this place listed on Yelp so I'm going to go ahead and suggest ordering their Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic for pasta lovers. Works for me, not too bland but just be sure to mix the bottom of the plate with the bow tie pasta. Regarding their cheesecakes.. I like them, not the best but still pretty good. Waiter service could use some work here, perhaps understaffed since its' been pretty meh the last few times I went. On a random note, it may just be me but this particular cheesecake restaurant feels poorly lit with the lights being dimmer than what I recall from other stores. Maybe it's lit poorly to encourage food coma naps after eating their huge portions, shrug. This Cheesecake Factory would be a lot more enjoyable place to visit if they ever chose to expand.

Herrick L.,"Fremont, United States",48,39,,3.0,2/6/2011,"Expect a long wait. The Cheesecake Factory is a popular restaurant, with a very appealing interior and a wide variety of signature cheesecakes and entrees. The serving sizes can be a bit too much, depending on what you order, so if you have a habit of always trying to clear your plate like I do, you will find it difficult to leave room for one of their delicious cheesecakes. Actually, even when I have to struggle to breathe from the amount of food I've eaten, I still make it a point to order a cheesecake. To me, they are just that good.  My favorite lunch option is the Margherita pizza, which uses fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil and is baked on a delicious flatbread crust. For dinner, I like the Steak Diane and Hibachi Steak. As for cheesecake, my favorite is definitely the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. The pros: - Food is usually good, cheesecakes are thick and delicious - Large dinner servings if you're hungry, but some might see this as a con.  - Spacious, classy interior, provides an excuse to dress up a little The cons: - Pretty expensive (cheesecakes $7+, entrees $15-$25+) - Always a long wait - For the cost, I was expecting the entrees to be tastier.  - Would like a smaller size option for dinner entrees Overall, I think I wouldn't come here much if it weren't for the cheesecakes. The cost and the driving distance are also an issue for me, since I live ~20 minutes away. It's worth trying though, if you don't mind waiting in line, taking home leftovers and paying a little extra, you will probably enjoy coming here more than I do.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1020

Hanna Y.,"Bay Area, United States",70,306,1,4.0,6/3/2011,"Back in the day, cheesecake factory had this special pizazz about it that when one thought of Cheesecake Factory, one reacted ""oOOoo!"" with eyes wide open. These days, it's kinda rubbing off like any other chain restaurant.  Nothing fancy shmancy about it.  Their actual dinner plates aren't as delicious as their small plates and appetizers.  However, they have a pretty decent drink menu.   I think the best appetizer I've had is the Thai Lettuce Wraps - no grease, no fat, no cholesterol.  Just good, healthy, fresh, and hearty meal.  Good for lunch or dinner.  Enough for 2.  Prices haven't changed much, and they've added new things to their menu, such as the small plates.

There's usually a wait, but it's not a big deal; I don't mind walking around Valley Fair for 20 minutes. Servers are generally nice, and the food is consistent. Gotta love their Pasta Da Vinci! Oh, and my favorite cheesecake, the pineapple upside down. If you're in a rush and want a casual snack/meal/drink/slice of cheesecake/etc, you could always just snag a seat in the bar area!

Joshua G.,"San Jose, United States",0,19,2,2.0,20/11/2014,"I want to say although I enjoy going to the cheesecake factory to get the cheesecake of course I have to say I felt completely disrespected at this restaurant particularly. Well to be fair it was not the sit and dine portion. It was the cheese cake bar area. After waiting in traffic I finally was able to get to the restaurant. The whole area in the entrance was packed but it consisted of diners. So the cheesecake area was empty and filled with employees just standing around. More so just chilling and chatting instead of taking my order.  I was then approached by a young lady with dark hair who heard me wrong. I then realized I had paid for the wrong size of cake. I asked some guy there to help me out and he just told me ""oh don't worry she will be right back"" It took her 20 mins to return while the others just stood there. When she had returned and I explained the problems she gave me a dirty look and got her supervisor and then the both proceeded to get me dirty looks.  I'm sure they realized that I was literally 2ft infront of them and I was able to hear all the huffing and puffing. I spoke loud enough, any louder and I would be yelling at her for my order.

Stephanie C.,"Redwood City, United States",4,363,5,3.0,20/8/2013,"It'd been a long time since I'd been to a Cheesecake Factory, so I had been hoping for pasta and had forgotten that their pasta apparently all has eggs in it (and I have a mild egg allergy). Oh well.  Instead I got the eggplant sandwich without the aioli, which was decent, but not stellar, and was actually surprisingly messy to eat. My companion got a pasta dish that I can't recall and we ordered the polenta fries as an appetizer. I very much liked the polenta fries, in spite of their lack of the structural integrity required to actually dip them in the marinara they come with :) My companion was disappointed by the lack of pumpkin cheesecake, but he didn't notice the seasonal note next to the item on the menu :P He did enjoy the cheesecake he got, but I think he'll want to come back for the pumpkin cheesecake come October, as that is a favorite dessert of his. The service was pretty clearly stretched thin, unfortunately. They were confused when we got back with our blinking table buzzer (perhaps they had mistakenly pinged us?) and we had to wait on the side for them to ""clear our table."" Our waitress, who was clearly trying quite hard, was speeding between several tables and took a while to get us our drinks and such.

When the bread is fresh and hot, it's also great. The few times where something was not up to par, the wait staff is usually very nice and good about fixing it.

Probably too nice for the low-quality food and service, so maybe it set my expectations too high. This is a great place for cheap kids food, although my kid's cheese pizza tasted like soap. Life advice: Please do not get the fettuccine with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes, unless you enjoy tough chicken, Chef Boyardee sauce, and bland pasta. When our server asked how it was, I said, ""Not great, it's..."" but then she walked away. I wanted to order something else, so I waited for the server to come back. They didn't. I asked another server if they could get ours, and they said sure! And 10 minutes later, no one. So I went in back to ask for help, they said they'd be right over -- and still didn't! And another 10 minutes went by -- so I went back again! And like a bad joke, they said they'd be right over, and believe it or not, they still did not show up. They did offer to reduce our bill, but I didn't want that. I just wanted to know how we'd become invisible, and I really wanted to eat something besides the bread and my kid's soap pizza. I think I've been spoiled by good restaurants. To be fair, if you like food at Chili's or Applebee's, you'll probably like this.

He took the food back and comes back 10 minutes later to take our order. Our entrees took 45 minutes to come out. While waiting for our entrees Jason never aknowledged us for refills on beverages or bread . He had no problems frequently helping the 2 tables next to us who had arrived AFTER us!! I flagged him down and asked to speak to his manager. I ask the manager if he would be so kind to get us refills and some bread since Jason never asked us if we wanted another appetizer instead. I expressed to the manager that i had never felt so discriminated against in a restaurant like this ever. He gave me a less than sincere apology but assigned us a much better waiter named jonathan who we made sure got a good tip since he was helpfull and very attentive.  Never saw the manager again after our meal to see how we were doing... i guess he must have better things to do than follow up with his customers.

I've been to the Cheesecake Factory several times before and I always have the same issue of deciding what to get on their very large menu. This time was no different. However, after a very long time with the menu I decided on a burger (the one with goat cheese) and a glass of sangria (white! my roommate got the red.) My friends ordered the chicken madeira and the miso salmon. The food arrived relatively quickly, and the waiter was really nice and everything, but I just wasn't too impressed with my burger. It was really small, to begin with, and it didn't taste as good as I had hoped. Maybe it was because there weren't very many goodies in my burger, as there were only a couple of mushrooms. ): However, the side salad was big, which was good since it made me feel a little better about eating the unhealthy burger. If I were to come back I'd probably not order a burger, and order one of the other million things on the menu.

This used to be one of my favorite go to spots years ago. I'm a little amazed that you somehow haven't found your way onto one of my reviews yet. I used to appreciate you a lot more back in the days when we had to travel to San Francisco just to spend some time with you. But now that you've popped up in so many locations close by, perhaps I've taken you for granted. Last week I met up with Kim on a busy Wednesday night. You'd think on a Wednesday night there wouldn't be that many people, but then again this place always seems to be packed. Once we were seated we were served a bread basket and instantly my quest of deciding what to pick from their extensive menu with never ending choices begins. While I'm munching on my favorite, the brown oat bread I finally narrow down my choices between two dishes, the Grilled Pork Chops or the Pasta Carbonara. Btw: If you haven't tried their brown bread, you have to try it because it's so delicious. After some debate, I decided to go with the Grilled Pork Chops and Kim ordered the Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane. ( ) Grilled Pork Chops (3.5 stars) ( ) Center cut chops served with house made apple sauce, mashed potatoes, and fresh spinach. The pork chops were good and perfectly cooked, but nothing breathtaking or to die for. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes, as they were fresh and quite creamy like. Yum! To this day, I'm not sure if I've ever tried their cheesecake, which is amazing considering how many times I've come here. The problem is their portions are so huge, that by the time I finish my food or tap out, I'm overstuffed like a turkey in stage 3 food coma. Some of my favorite dishes here include: Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Avocado Egg Rolls, & Chicken Madeira. Summary (3.75 Stars): Great place for picky eaters or a large group of friends, as they offer an extensive menu with many different dishes to decide on.

I called in a few hours before I planned coming here to make a reservation for a party of 15. Turns out they don't take reservations. We made the decision to just go there afterwork and not worry about having a reservation. We sent one girl from our party to the restaurant to put our name down for a table and they informed us that they won't seat us until at least half of our table is there. We waited 40 minutes and when our party was ready we went up to the front only to find out that they gave our table away. We were furious! There was no communication and even though the girl claimed she was the manager, she never once checked in with us to see if half our party had arrived. They put our names back on the list and told us it would be another 40 minutes. We had no other options at this point so we decided to just wait it to out only to discover that they gave away our table AGAIN. We left and headed over to California Pizza Kitchen where they went above and beyond to give us a good experience.

My girlfriend and I waited for about 20 minutes after our main course without acknowledgement from our server.  Normally, I wouldn't complain, business might be out of control, maybe she's covering an extra shift.  What really set us off was the way she would pass our table (5 times total) without even checking on us and prioritize other customers that were seated after us.  The server gave the couple next to us great service, and they got in a good 7-12 minutes after we were seated!  She would check on them often and bypass our table.   This is the second worse service I have received; doubt I'll return anytime soon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=800

I love their pastas! If I want something ""healthy"" I'd get the Evelyn's favorite pasta. Their farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic is also very good. Their portions are generous so you do pay for what you get. Also, you can never go wrong with the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, but I would suggest not to force yourself to finish it all since the spiciness can get to you if you are a weak spice eater like me. :P  I have also gotten their crispy artichoke hearts under their small plates selections, it was just okay. Their vietnamese tacos were surprisingly delicious. Their buffalo wings with lots of blue cheese are really good because they are crispy and the meat is very soft. Their fried mac n cheese come in 4 balls, they're fried so of course, they are not good for your cholesterol levels. One bite into them, the creamy mac and cheese just melts in your mouth. Eating 2 balls is plenty because it does get filling.  Lastly, you can't forget their cheesecake. The ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake is OMG good!

Dianna P.,"Hayward, United States",0,34,,3.0,1/11/2010,"Good service, clean & cute restaurant, good bread, good appetizers & of course, good dessert. Best appetizer = Dynamite shrimp, perfectly crispy tempura shrimp with a yummy ""dynamite dipping sauce"". Only big problem is their food(like their actual entrees). I have yet to be really amazed by their food! I mean, I wouldn't say their food is gross... but I wouldn't say it's yummy either. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - Not as spicy as it sounds. Actually it's pretty plain.  Four Cheese Pasta - Too cheesy but not the good kind of cheesy in my definition&I usually love cheesiness! Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - Nothing too special. It's actually kind of plain except for the little fried tortilla strip things on top. That was the best part. Mmmmm. Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried tomatos - Meh! I expected a little bit more creaminess (the description does say garlic, cream, etc!). But it was nothing close to it. In fact, it tasted like really really oily noodles is all. Oily to the point of oil dripping off each fork-full. Yum? Even the chicken of was tasteless. Okay, I will say this one was pretty gross. Some kind of chicken thing - Overcooked & dry but I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes & vegetables that came with it! :) I've decided that if I ever come back, I will stick to getting just appetizers & desserts.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1160

You know you've arrived. If nothing else, Cheesecake Factory makes the waiting area at least spacious enough. Our party of 8 loitered for almost an hour before our pager finally buzzed. I suppose there was no way around it. Thursday night, 7p, what are the chances of being seated immediately. Nevertheless, we happily trudged to our table. We devoured the brown bread loaf and quickly asked for more. For dinner, I was torn between trying a new dish or one of my old favorites - like the Jambalaya or Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp - I went for a new entree  this time - the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta ($12.95). Chicken, asparagus bits with red and yellow Peppers, the pasta dish was colorful. The spicy chipotle parmesan cream sauce wasn't actually very spicy. Could have been kicked up a notch. As usual though, the portion was gia-normous and I had plenty to take home for round 2 the following day. For dessert, we tried the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake ($6-ish). It tastes just like how it sounds - rich deep chocolate. And of course finished with a cloud of light airy whipped cream. Great for sharing.

Yuyu Z.,"San Jose, United States",63,22,10,4.0,10/6/2012,"I love Cheesecake Factory, probably one of my favorite restaurant. The food is super yummy. I recommend Chicken Bellagio, Chicken Picata, and as appetizer the Buffalo blast. Their food is a bit pricey but the portion is well worth the price. I always attempt to save room for cheesecake as dessert but it never happens. I think they have great waitress and waiters every now and then you get one that's not great but usually I love my waiter/waitress. One of my favorite sides to get there as not yummy as it sounds is a side of fries with ranch. They have THEEE best fries and THEEE best ranch. And trust me, I've eaten a lot of different fries and ranch before. Their complementary bread is also super yum! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's ALWAYS busy. Sometime the wait is not that long but sometime you could be waiting for HOURS. Sometimes they accept reservations sometimes they don't. The restaurant itself is beautiful, take a moment to take in the setting. Then look up around the ceiling and pillars its actually really pretty. The lighting is pretty darn romantic at night, I'd say it's a great place to have a nice romantic dinner. What more can I say?

The service of the staff is excellent and I haven't encountered one bad server yet.

Terry H.,"San Jose, United States",1101,655,15,3.0,31/1/2009,"Have you ever had a headache that sits right behind your eyes so that you even smell things differently along with a strange inability to hear and see the TV like you are used to doing... a nosee'-sinusee' pressure with radiating ache to the point where you aren't sure if you are coming down with a cold or flu or something worse? A tiring uncomfortableness that seeks to drive you to bed way too early so that you can't watch any of the daily shows you have TIVO'd. No? Then neither have I.  Really, here's the review. Time to get serious and use my vocabulary that education has afforded me the ability to complete somewhat rationally. Maybe it's because I just broke my Atkins diet with a huge Alps-sized mountain of garlic mashed potatoes and my body wasn't used to it after 30 days. Or because I ordered my usual decaff coffee and ended up drinking 3 or 4 cups. Or because the crashing din inside of The Cheesecake Factory was so loud that I could barely hear what the people next to me were saying. Me thinks it was a combination of the three. The bottom line is that it is aspirin time which isn't a good sign for the Factory getting 5 stars from me. We came here for a birthday party, 11 awesome, sweet, diverse and hungry people. But in looking over the menu I felt like I was reading a textbook for an upcoming university Chemistry course with ads inside. Never have I been to a restaurant that had so many different choices, I said to my next-to companion that if I chose a different item everyday I wouldn't be able to go through from front to back in 4 months. Several of the party had eaten at the Cheesecake before so they warned me off of the appetizers, bread and the pre-salad. I listened and was glad that I did as the meal unfolded. My entree, after much mental anguish in making a proper decision, was the salisbury steak. Why? Because I haven't had that in ages and I frankly was missing it. When my plate arrived, I was stunned by the massiveness of the offering. Tons of crisp green beans warmed slightly with an essence of lemon-vinegar dressing. Crunchy to the tooth and full of flavor. Personally, it is really hard to mess up green beans if you remember to just barely cook them. I love eating them raw in the bag straight from the grocery store... naturally full of vitamins, minerals and sugar.  Then I sampled their garlic mashed potatoes, in first looking at it, I knew it was going to be like scaling the Matterhorn. They were creamy with pureed mixed with small chunks of red skin and garlic bite, not overpowering garlic but subtle and elegant. It is refreshing to be served real mashed potatoes, not powdered or premade but like you make them at home. So far, so good. I'm kind of wierd when I eat. If I really like something I tend to keep on eating that part of the meal before I move on to the rest. It's not something that I like doing and other people have commented on it but it's a habit none the less. Guess I have to try and break that one.  On to the salisbury steak. It was brown and juicy and covered with onions and gravy just like a salisbury steak should be but this is where the meal began to fall apart due to the fact that it didn't have much flavor. When I ordered it, I was under the mistaken impression that mushrooms would be involved in a mighty way but they seem to have instead run off to the hills, nowhere to be found. Now for me salisbury steak and mushrooms go together like pancakes and maple syrup, peanut butter and jelly, pizza and pepperoni, Cabernet Sauvignon and pork chops, the beach and sunglasses. Unfortunately, my finale fell flat. I didn't even finish it. As for the birthday girl, she ordered a wonderful chicken dish that included a half-chicken, some delicious looking carrots and a bigger dollop of potatoes than even I had. She was totally happy and even took what she couldn't finish home in a big, black box. It was her day, so I'm glad she chose the right thing for her. She also ordered an amazing smelling vanilla cheesecake covered with a festive mound of whipped cream and curlie-cue chocolate syrup that tied the plate all together. I even took a picture of it, my first picture ever of food too. Unfortunately, it was awfully dark by the time it arrived so it came out poorly. Next time, I'll use a flash and post it for you all to see. Would I be back? Well, it was awfully expensive even though they wouldn't let me pay for anything and it was so noisy that if you ever went here on a date or business meeting, you wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of the conversation, just a lot of blank nods and teethy smiles. The food was good but not remarkable, a little above average I guess if I want to be nice and I always want to be nice. But if someone else wanted to go here, I would say ""Yes"" just to make them happy because I like to have happy dates. Me! Meh!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1160
Salina M.,"Campbell, United States",8,38,34,4.0,2/9/2009,"I eat here quite often and I have to say that even though I am not really a fan of corporate giant restaurants taking over and pushing out the little mom and pop shops, I love this place! I tend to eat really early or really late...9:30pm or later and it is nice that they are open so late. I like being able to stroll in to a restaurant at 10 at night and not have to feel rushed through your meal cuz the place is closing. The menu has a lot to choose from so here are my findings: Miso Salmon - excellent! salmon is never overcooked and the flavors are wonderful, I order mash potatoes instead of rice Kobe Beef Burger - yummy! if you like mushroom, ask for extra mushroom as the burger does not ""come with"" too many on there Baked Potato soup - eh not such a fan, sent this one back Bang Bang Chicken - DO NOT ORDER THIS unless you are ok with receiving a plate of food that is absolutely covered in dried coconut! Don't get me wrong I love coconut but in moderation. Mini Pizzettes: love the margerita and the mushroom one, portion is perfect, crust has great flavor and are not smothered in cheese. I like my pizza with only a little cheese so that I can still taste the crust Small Plate Stuffed Mushrooms: these are good every once in a while, the sauce is a little sweet for me sometimes Eggs Blackstone: sooooo good. This is on the Sunday Brunch menu, it is basically eggs benedict but with poached egg, mushrooms, bacon, spinach and hollandaise on english muffin.  Beware of other items on the breakfast menu - Ordered a couple of other breakfast omelette items and they were both terrible!! Fried Calamari: This is the best I have had yet! the breading is seasoned well and the calamari is moist and not rubbery Favorite Cheescakes: Banana and Tirimissu Drink: I always order the passion iced tea, it has great flavor and doesnt even really need sugar =) One last thing - ALWAYS ASK FOR A BOOTH, trust me it is worth the extra five minute wait. Tables are placed so closed together that if you are an average size person, you need to turn sideways  just to sit down (I'm so not kidding...) and its impossible to have a conversation without the people sitting next to you hearing everything you say.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1160

I ordered my absolute favorite, the avocado egg rolls with the sublime tamarind sauce.  Once in a while, when they get it just right, it's almost orgastic.  Unfortunately, tonight wasn't one of those nights.  But, it's still good.  My other favorite is the quesadilla with chicken.  It's so simple, but the melted cheese in the warm tortilla just goes down so nice with the guacamole, salsa, and sour cream toppings.    Overall, it was fantastic as usual.  The warm molasses bread always hits the spot.  I always feel warm and fuzzy afterwards, even if it's followed quickly by food-coma.  The portions are very decent considering their target clientele, who are usually size 12+ peeps and skinny, bottomless pit guys like me.  By little Asian girl standards, the plates are huge.  Even for me, I can only manage to handle two appetizers and a pasta plate.  I rarely make it to dessert unless I specifically went there for a night cap.   So, that was it for this stop.  My aim for the night was variety for my guests so we hopped on over to Thea Mediterranean to finish off the night.  I'll be back again soon enough and probably to hit the appetizers on happy hour.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1140

I picked the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, which I hadn't had before. I wanted something light, and not overly sweet, so this turned out to be a good choice. Cool, creamy, and smooth. Mmm. This had to be one of the better Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to (at least better than the location at Oakridge Mall). Better lit, prompt service. Well, they were kinda slow in picking up our check, but I was enjoying time with my friend, so I didn't mind. Let's say I didn't feel rushed!

(Still recommended to get it) Entrees: Four cheese pasta and I believe the chipotle pasta: Pretty delicious, the first dish came out and the pasta was undercooked so we told the waiter and he made sure that they made us another dish right away. He also double checked on us when the dish came out a second time to make sure that it was up to par with our liking.  Dessert: The red velvet cheesecake: I was skeptical about this at first because many red velvet cakes that I've tried are dry, but this cheesecake is perfect. I think this is the best item the whole night ( I've still crave it now and then). All in all, good place to go to.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1140

I had only been to the Oakridge location before but even that was a long time ago. My friends and I came here yesterday before we went to see a movie at Century 22 just a few blocks away. I ordered the Tons of Fun Burger... not the healthiest thing of course, but it sounded good to me. The waiter who helped us, Joe, was great. He had a good sense of humor and the dinner experience was never made uncomfortable. My burger was the last item to come to the table and he told me, ""It is called the Tons of Fun Burger because for your friends it is a ton of fun to see how you manage to eat it.""  The burger itself was pretty good, it didn't blow away the competition or anything. What made the experience great was definitely the service and the people I enjoyed my meal with.  When we were finished eating, Joe asked one of the girls at our table if she wanted her mustard to go. (because she had explained how important it was to have mustard at the beginning of the meal.) She sarcastically said, ""No, just pack up the lettuce and butter for me.""  I said, ""I bet you he will."" Sure enough, he did.

We came at 10:00 and still had to wait 20 min to be seated.   Other than that, the food is always pretty good.  My boyfriend and I usually get a fatty appetizer and a salad and share, and there are still usually leftovers since the servings are so large.  This past time we went we had calamari, the factory chopped salad, and the thai chicken lettuce wraps.  Calamari was really good!  I like both the dipping sauces and the calamari was not overly breaded and fried like it can be at many places.  The thai chicken wraps are also really good - and they're great if you're trying not to eat carbs.  The chopped salad was okay.  I'm a huge salad person (that's what I usually get for my entree) and this one wasn't spectacular, but wasn't horrible either.  I think the best part was the apple bits mixed in which add a little extra tang/sweetness to the salad.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1200

Took a friend here for her b-day. For 2, not too long of a wait for a Saturday night - 35 mins (yes I consider this short since I have been told up to 3-4 hours a few times) For dinner my friend had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - good vegetarian pasta with all the what I call must have pasta goodies including broccoli, artichoke, basil, garlic and pine nuts. She took the leftovers home and her kids gobbled it all up! Must have been good if kids approve! I had the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Yummy! I do not normally order shrimp dishes, but my friend wanted to try it. Good shrimp (and amount of shrimp), and more good pasta goodies - mushrooms, arugula (nice touch) and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce. For drinks, my friend had the Strawberry Lemonade - good and not too tart or sweet. I had the Frozen Iced Mango - reminds me of the one raspberry swirl drink from the Elephant Bar. Yum! Onto the good stuff: dessert! My friend was thinking we order one cheesecake and share... sha! As if! I ordered 3 desserts for the 2 of us! That's what to-go boxes were made for! Greedy people like me! ; ) Chocolate Oreo Mudslide Cheesecake - not bad, could have been better. No distinct flavors came out of it... The 30th ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE was awesome! Very simple - layers of original cheesecake and chocolate fudge cake with chocolate cream. Sooo good!

When we were waiting for the check a manager stopped by, apologized and also offered us a replacement side of hashbrowns.  We're done eating...no we don't want another side dish. At the very least they could have offered us a coupon for a freebie piece of cheesecake. This isn't the only thing they burn.  I've gotten a chicken dish in the past where the entire bottom portion was burnt.  I've cooked at restaurants and I know when I've burned something.  It seems like these guys think they can put it black side down and cover it in sauce and no one will notice it tastes like charcoal.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=860

Lianne D.,"San Francisco, United States",437,169,122,3.0,3/3/2010,"I honestly think Cheesecake Factory is more of a hype factor.. in my opinion that is. I came here last weekend for my friend's weekend. We had 17 people and they seated us in 20 or so minutes. Pretty much got seated at 4:30 so by, 4:45 everyone was ready to order.. we waited for the waiter until 4:55 and the waiter tells us that we're not longer able to order in the lunch menu... like Really? We were sitting there and waiting and you're going to wait until 5 to come take our order.. Of course being in a large party, people definitely wanted the lunch menu so, the waiter arrange it to work. The service was pretty decent. Our waiter gave all 17 individual checks so we didn't have to pay for the party service.. which is definitely a plus! I ordered the Farfelle pasta... I wouldn't recommend it. I feel that it was tasteless. There were really nothing special about the sauce. So, I wouldn't recommend it.

The rest of this review is more directed for families with young children (aka: babies).  My husband and I always talk about walking over to Santana Row after browsing Valley Fair for lunch. Out of the two times we've talked about it, we've never been able to make the trek over. Instead, we always stop by Cheesecake factory right before the wait gets too crazy.  Our son is only 7 months old, but he's a huge 7 month old boy! Without asking, the hostess brought us to our table with 2 adult menus and a kid's menu. We later told her that we didn't need a kid's menu. Right when we sat down, our server brought us over some slices of bananas with bread in the shape of a butterfly. Yikes, they were so nice! We can't tell them that he can't eat solid foods yet. So I mashed up the bananas and gave it to our son for a pre-lunch snack.  We never realized how important changing pads are in restaurants till we had a baby of our own. I dunno what's worse, a bathroom with a nasty changing pad or a bathroom with no changing pad at all! Anyway, Cheesecake Factory has a really nice bathroom with a clean changing pad area!  In short, this is a great chain restaurant to bring young ones.

But didn't get in until about an hour later =/ My friends around me ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, 4 Cheese Pasta, Pasta Da Vinci, Fried Mac n Cheese, Crispy Taquitos, 2 shots of Hennessy, a sour apple martini, and a tropical martini. The Cajun pasta was the only plate that turned out good. It tasted kind of like pad thai in some sort of way. The 4 cheese pasta was super bland, no flavor and the pasta da vinci noodles were really undercooked also with no flavor. We had to pour in a lot of tobasco and pepper into the plates to try to get that stuff down our throats. Mac n Cheese texture was nasty. It felt like I was eating Mac n Cheese inside a fuzzy furball. And the taquitos were average. But I must have to say the sour apple martini was perfection. Besides that the Tropical martini was a bit on the strong side, and the hennessy shots weren't worth the money since it wasn't filled to the rim.  The service was great. But it didn't make up for the lack of quality in their food. But by golly was their bread GOOD. I ate like 3 loaf of them. no joke. for about $16 a plate, I don't think I would come back.

For some reason our Herb Salmon dish tasted sour, and the herbs tasted like seaweed. It wasn't satisfying and did not taste the same like it did before.

Katrina T.,"Cupertino, United States",61,959,1588,4.0,25/3/2012,"3.5 stars or 4 stars? I'm in decisive, so can't decide how many stars I should really give The Cheesecake Factory.  I used to come here lots as a kid. Loved it! Loved getting their cheesecakes because they are truly one of the best with their endless decadent choices. It's been awhile since I had come here and after my visit, the feel for this place felt different.  I didn't get the feel of originality from the restaurant anymore. I felt like it was just trying to keep up with its competitors in terms of their menu. They have a ""SkinnyLicious"" menu. What I don't understand is why the prices on this menu are the same as the regular menu. The only difference is that it is less in calories, so essentially its ""healthier"". Shouldn't the prices be less if there is less food? IDK.  Anyway got the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad. Pretty spicy. Fresh tuna. The salad wasn't the best thing ever at the same time wasn't the worst. I think I should have gotten the BBQ Chicken Salad or pasta.  Our waiter was really nice but super off. He took forevs to give us our bread. My gf ordered a BOWL of clam chowder, he though she said cup and apologized saying he would charge her for the cup instead. When the bill came out he ended up charging her for the BOWL. Uh weird. Then when he needed to talk to another party sitting next to us, he awkwardly had to kneel over our side of the table to reach over to the other side. This probably doesn't make any sense whatsoever, but whatever he did was AWKS.  Hopefully I can come here again and enjoy myself more!

This location was no exception.  I went with my family, all of whom (excluding me) are fairly picky eaters. Two of us got the Factory Burrito Grande without chicken, and the other two got pastas (four-cheese & pasta w/ marinara sauce). We were all incredibly satisfied by the portions and quality of food. What was equally impressive was our waiter, Eric E. We told him we were vegetarian and he later came back to ask if we can take chicken broth. Apparently it's in some sauce in the burrito, and he noticed it and came to ask! The food took a little bit longer to prepare because of the burrito modification, but he and the manager apologized to us several times. We were all incredibly awed by his sensitivity to our dietary needs and even told his manager as much. I've rarely ever had such a thoughtful waiter!  My reason for knocking off one star has to do with the price of the cheesecake. I used to frequently visit The Cheesecake Factory in Batimore, MD, and I remember the cheesecake slices being reasonably-priced, NOTHING like the $6.75-$7.75+ at the Valley Fair location.

With that said, I still can't stand this place. The wait is invariably ridiculous and their system of making servers sort of share tables is frustrating. One person comes to greet you and bring you drinks, another takes your order. The first person comes back and brings you your food. You ask for a refill and they tell you that they'll make sure your server gets that to you right away. Dagnabbit, who is my server??? Why is it that the person who seems to be doing all the running around doesn't get the tip? And why can't I ever get a refill? You just gave me four pounds of pasta, can I have another water please?  Please, sah! 'Ave some pity on me poor, parched soul and give me a refill, guv'na!!! I'm not blaming the servers, I know they're slammed with the bazillion other people demanding things in this gigantic restaurant with behemoth servings. It's the whole system. The three different cheesecake factories I've been to have all been like this, and I've tried to give them a chance multiple times. Also, the food is so rich that if you order an appetizer, you barely dig into your meal, and my boyfriend has gotten a stomach ache off those boneless buffalo wings--twice! Not a fluke!

Appetizer- FRIED MAC AND CHEESE served in ball form with marinara sauce. its crunchy on the outside and hot n cheesey on the inside.  Lunch or dinner -  BISTRO SHRIMP PASTA herb crusted shrimp with veggies and a light wine sauce(i think) its amazingly good and isnt as heavy feeling as a lot of other creamy pastas. citrus lemony taste of goodness. they have it as a lunch or dinner portion...either way i still go home with left overs. and its really good as a left over!  Dessert- RED VELVET CHEESECAKE i love this because its both cake and cheesecake. the perfect balance! its smooth and creamy. i also love the chocolate tuxedo and the fresh banana cheesecakes.  ive never really had a problem with service here. usually the only poor service are the ones taking ure reservation at the front desk but who cares we dont tip them. hah!  will always come back for lunch with my mother here. woohoo!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1300

You can't really go wrong with cheesecake factory if youre looking for a casual place to eat. Definently not a place if you want something quiet. Service is typical like any casual place like this. Theyre not really going to spiel you or talk you up wines. But like i said many times before, its a casual place to just come in jeans and get your grub on. The only way cheesecake factory went wrong (though i did not take a star off since this is the steven's creek location) is the Oakridge mall location. I've tried to give this place a second chance. third chance and it had failed me EVERY time.

Maybe my tastebuds are off, but Cheesecake Factory is a very good representation of why I do not usually like chain restaurants.  First of all, the menu is way too big here, and nothing on it is very appealing.  I personally do not understand WHY a restaurant needs to bombard their customers with such a large menu and aside from menu options, there's ADVERTISEMENTS in their menu.. why? why? why? They really need to learn that the more simple a menu is, the better.  Also, the food here in my opinion, is absolutely horrible. All of their food taste like the frozen microwave dinners I buy at the supermarket. Every time I've come here, I've gotten bad service.  Last time I was here, our waitress had the audacity to be rude AND roll her eyes at me.  I also feel bad for the uniform here.  The all white suits w/ties is really really unattractive on the females. I know my review may seem to be harsh, but I'm really not that picky.  Check out my other reviews.  I feel like I am too lenient and not picky about restaurants.. But Cheesecake Factory is really one of those places where i CANNOT UNDERSTAND why there is always a wait, and how they even stay successful. Now you must wonder why I've been here a couple of times.  One of my friends love it here, and if it's her turn to choose, she'll pick Cheesecake Factory once in awhile. uGhhhhh.... oooh, last but not least, drinks here aren't good either. honestly, if the food here were cheaper, i wouldn't think so badly of it.  The price really does not equal the quality.  Definitely a quantity over quality restaurant.  Sorry, I like quality in my food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1300

Lacking options, I ordered a pasta dish and a side salad.  I was informed even their side salads were large, so I declined.  But can't you just make less?  I ended up sharing the salad that came with my mother-in-law's pizza.  It was indeed large, and there wasn't enough dressing. I'm just never impressed with Cheesecake Factory...especially when seeing a simple root beer is $3.  Can we say overpriced? I'm also perplexed by the decor.  It's....aesthetically pleasing enough, but I'm disturbed by the numerous allusions to female body parts.  Little paint swoops that look like breasts, some sort of window etching resembling a uterus with Fallopian tubes, and the strange geodesic vulva topping the booth backings.  Not exactly appetizing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1300

The cheesecake is the same--good, but not a amazing. Likewise, they have a wide selection of cheesecake.  However, the service here is horrible.  I pre-ordered a cheesecake and I selected a pickup time that was not busy (a Tuesday around 11AM). Moreover, I ordered a very basic cheesecake (just strawberry topping). Although, I arrived on time my cheesecake was not ready.  Not only was is not ready--it took them 45minutes to prepare it. The cheesecake portion was done but the strawberry's were not put on. I was told this was done to ensure the cake tasted fresh--fair enough. However you would think that they would have the strawberries cut so that they could be put on quickly. No, sadly that was not the case. Therefore, I had to watch my server cut about 2 dozen strawberries dip them in syrup (which he had to replenish because they also ran out of this) and then put them on one by one. This took 45 minutes.  If one pre-orders a cake I expect arrangements to be made so that last minute assembly (which is understandable) be taken care of ahead of time so that customers are not waiting. Furthermore, there were no bags big enough to hold my cake box, even though I bought a standard size. Although, this is a minor detail--I think it is a 'nicety' most customers should expect.  Likewise, I've also been here for dinner. For some absurd reason they don't take reservations. I think that is completely unfair when customers can expect to wait for three hours and when your food is simply mediocre.

Good thing it was my cheat day because this thing is not for the calorie conscious at all. Thick French Toast. Bacon. Ham. Eggs. All in a beautiful sandwich form. I almost couldn't finish it all but my table coached me through it and I wiped the plate clean. Can't wait to go back and do it again next Sunday :) Excellent service as always. Not to crowded for a Sunday around noon. We were seated within 5 minutes. Love this place,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1000

Their food and the quality of food is consistent everywhere and they have great bread starters. I love their appetizers and their skirt steak is to die for. They also have especially good chicken dishes because their chicken is always very well cooked and tender so its great on any dish. Their cheese cakes I can't comment on since I'm not a huge dessert fan, but they do give out huge slices and one of my favorites I've tried is the fresh banana cream cheese cake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1000

It took 20 minutes for us to skim through the entire menu, which is a book!  Lots of variety, from small plates, to breakfast served all day, to pastas, pizza, etc.  They have a ""weight management"" section, but I've ordered from it before and immediately regretted it...the flavors just weren't there.  Besides, who wants to order a ""weight management"" chicken salad??  They also have a menu that provides all the calorie-counts...which are surprisingly high for most of the dishes :(. I usually order the Chicken Madeira, which is super tender and moist...my fave!  The Louisiana chicken pasta is scrumptious as well.  This time, I went for the nachos...they were extremely greasy, and were loaded with cheese, guacamole, salsa, and sour cream.  I should have ordered a ""small plate"" but my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  There goes the hour-long workout I did earlier tonight!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1000

These places are perfect examples of the ""yes, we're busy, so you can wait, and you'll like it."" They don't take reservations, and they won't seat large groups until the last seating of the night, then they'll give poor service, because they already lock-in their 20% gratuity for parties 6 or more.  but they try to compensate by throwing a free appetizer at you which prolly costs them like $1.00 to make even though they are gonna make a killing on everything else.

Stephanie Y.,"San Jose, United States",24,61,,4.0,28/6/2010,"ahh. Cheesecake Factory.  With a menu that could pass as a short novel, I find that I order the same things because it would take just too darn long to find a new dish.  I often order pastas here because the portions are huge and they're so tasty. The downside is that many of the dishes are packed with calories, so if you're trying to watch your weight, share the dishes with friends, or wait to visit this place. In general, whether it's pasta, or salad, or something different, their portions are very hearty, and probably worth two meals for a female, and enough to stuff a male. I absolutely love the complimentary bread, warm and fresh from the oven. Two kinds-but everyone knows the brown bread is better than the sour dough (at least in my opinion).  My favorite dish has got to be the Chicken Bellagio. It's a really good deal, with hearty portions at a lower price than some of their regular menu pastas. The chicken is lightly breaded and moist, with a bed of pesto pasta sitting in a light cream sauce. It's topped off with fresh arugula and large pieces of prosciutto. All in all a great combination of flavors.  This place can get very busy at night, especially on the weekends, and you can't make reservations without a larger party (around 8 or 10 people), so I'd get here early if you can. I've waited an hour to eat here with only a party of two. But the bread is just so good...it was worth the wait. Stephs' Recommendations: Chicken Bellagio (it's on the Specials Menu, so you won't find this on their regular menu) Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1320
Naomi Y.,"Los Gatos, United States",666,206,905,5.0,1/11/2008,"Pros: I have never gotten bad service here. The appetizer platter is delish. I LOVE LOVE the Chicken Madeira, Hibachi Steak, and  Mahi Mahi Mediterranean.  Some of my other favorites are the Miso Salmon, The Jambalaya with extra sauce, and Scampi (the prawns are huge!), and the Tuna Tataki Salad, and their version of a philly cheesesteak is very flavorful and the bread is perfect!  Their mashed potatoes (thank God!!) are fresh and creamy! I love their complimentary bread too; Sourdough and wheat (love the wheat). You can even buy the loaf of bread for 7 bucks. Desserts: The Tiramisu Cake (NOT CHEESECAKE!) is the BEST I have EVER HAD..... The Next best desserts are the pumpkin cheesecake, Dulce De Leche cheesecake, Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake, Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and I love the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake!!! mmmmhmmm!!! So 5 stars easy because service, quality, and those two things are worth the price! Also, this place is consistent. Cons: The parking can really suck at the Valley Fair Mall location. It's a frenzy looking for a parking spot on a regular day! BUT when Christmas is around the corner just go to the valet and get your ticket validated to save you some 20-40 minutes of scarce parking frenzy.  Floor can be really slippery, so watch out ladies in your stilettos Lastly, they DON'T take reservations EVEN for LARGE parties. WALK INS ONLY and the WHOLE party or MORE than Half the party has to be there to GET SAT... SIGH.. Also, if the party is more than 2 then the wait is at minimum 45 minutes at dinner time. At lunch time I typically get sat right away or wait maybe 10 minutes max. Have a friend run in and put your name on the wait list as you search for a spot. Pretty much this place is consistent with the pros and cons.

My twin sister picked this place for our 25th birthday because she knows I love Jambalaya Pasta. I eat a lot with my family so we tend to fine in large groups. Cheesecake Factory seemed accommodating. But upon arrival we were told to wait for a manager just for a quote wait time. The wait was less than about ten minutes until we were seated. But there were no formal greetings just wait . We were surprised at to be seated because we were under the impression that we were waiting for a superior. The waiter/waitress were not attentive. I noticed that they would take 2-3 orders at a time and jump from person to person. It took them 20 minutes to bring me my beer. That's 20 minutes AFTER all other beverages and appetizers were served. Not only did they lag on my beer, I waited yet another 20 minutes for my pasta. All the while my entire party were at the end of their dish. The jambalaya pasta was a complete fail. Not only because oft experience at the time but because it genuinely lacked all the authentic flavors. The added chicken was bland and tasteless. The Cajun shrimp was boring. The taste uneventful in any way . The vegetables undercooked. Also, I hate the fact that restaurants like such charge a higher percentage ""gratuity fee"" when their Hospitality does not justify such demand. They are not fit to accommodate a larger paying party. 15 people with No room an second to none eating space. When I see 2-6 parties eat with lounge luxury. So, in conclusion: I was very Very Excited and Eager to try Cheescake Factory for the very first time. But to no avail. I hope people can appreciate the constructive Criticism.

This location though takes a hit b/c the parking situation is not ideal.  You have tons of mall attendees to compete with and the $5 valet service they offer is ridiculous.  You can offer the service, but that doesn't make up for the stupidity of location. Next, our service at this location was pretty lackluster.  Besides being slow, the orders came out wrong.  That can happen anywhere, but normally the staff would react better.   If you do want a good piece of cheesecake then there is nowhere better to go.  3 out of 5, and hoping next time will offer a better experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1360

After 40 minutes, you'll probably forget about it and be brought back to life by its electric jolt.) Despite our long long wait, I enjoyed dinner. For a chain restaurant, the flavors and general quality of food was better than I was expecting. We enjoyed the appetizer platter. The avacado rolls are yummy.

Service is still good as well, so I can't complain about that. The wait here is ridiculously long. The quality of the the cheesecake is still pretty good from what I understand (I'm not a big dessert person), but the prices are pretty absurdly expensive. Unless you're in the mood for a particular type of fancy cheesecake, you're much better off going to a place like Trader Joe's or Costco - the value there is ridiculous, and the quality really good too. Is it worth the wait? I would say it's not, so if you're curious to try out the restaurant, go when it's not as busy. Avoid the weekend evenings, especially Friday and Saturday nights. Also, they give you pagers, but I have no idea why they only work around the restaurant. It pretty much defeats the purpose if you ask me.

Heidi L.,"San Jose, United States",57,50,13,1.0,9/9/2012,"It was a really hard time finding something gluten free to eat on the menu - it was  a lot of going back and forth with the kitchen - almost everything has gluten (even some items listed on the internet that stated it was GF was incorrect). Then when finally my food did arrive they served it with their tartar sauce, which has gluten!!! Luckily I had googled a lot of information and had known it contained gluten since the waiter did not. Long wait, one of the waiters had really bad breath, menu contains a bunch of adds, not gluten friendly there and the food was just OK.

Karen R.,"Seattle, United States",65,219,114,3.0,25/10/2007,"This was the only place opened after 10pm when everyone on Santana Row went to sleep - on a weekday.  I wasn't thrilled by the idea of going to CF but I didn't have much choice as it was just across the street... all the other CF's I've seen have always been packed with people and the crowd often overflows onto the mall or wherever it's located.   I'm not a cheesecake fan (at all) but I must say, the two slices of cheesecakes that we brought back to the hotel... yummers!!  I know it's mass made and all but I really liked it! The food is kind of chili's-like but if you have a huge group and don't know how to please everyone, I say this is a good place to go.  Their menu is HUGE!  It takes a good portion of the meal time to read lol!   The buffalo blast (buffalo chicken in spring roll wrapper and deep fried) is good but don't expect to  be eating anything else after that.  it's super filling!  Too much for two people for sure. The Santa Fe salad should have been served in a fish tank!  It's mega huge!!  I ate and ate and ate and the pile of vegetables never subsided!  I couldn't see any chicken but every bloody mouthful I took, there was chicken.  Pretty insane!  Not a very impressive or colorful salad and sadly, Chilli's has a better salad... so don't bother...

This location is great since I love valleyfair and Santana row. The servers are more than polite and very easy to converse with. The only downside is the long wait and the food isn't the healthiest so of course you bring half the food home. I enjoy the factory burger and caramel chicken (special menu). The bread is delicious!

Katie C.,"Los Angeles, United States",163,407,338,3.0,17/2/2010,"When you think of Cheesecake Factory, you think of the fancy place for overpriced American food. Don't get me wrong, their food is fantastic, but just expense and the portions are huge. In my opinion, I rather have a regular sized portion for a good price. Who needs more than they can eat anyway?  Lets start off with the environment. It's impossible to find parking especially on a Fri or Sat night. It's right across from Santana Row so people like to park in this area and just walk across to Santana Row after shopping or eating at Valley Fair. You can always Valet your car, but people in San Jose just don't do that... The restaurant is beautifully decorated and truly fancy. You can come here in a prom dress and you won't feel out of place. There is lots of seating, but this restaurant gets really busy, really fast. And they don't take reservations and that is horrible on their part. They refused to let me make a reservation before prom, I mean we aren't willing to wait 2-3 hours for a table for 11 when we have a prom to go to. You're losing out on a $200+ bill. Too bad for them right? Before I came here for my 15th birthday and I literally waited 2 hours for a table for my huge group. It was horrible. I vowed never to come back with a group bigger than 5 people.  The service is great. They are top notch for a chain restaurant, Usually you expect service like at Chili's or Applebees, but no. They are really fantastic. They help you order, answer any questions and are always attentive on refilling drinks. They also don't mind giving you more bread. And by the way, the bread here is FANTASTIC. So good. Comes out warm so the butter just melts on to the bread. Just don't get too carried away with eating bread, remember the food portions are HUGE. You'll be lucky just to finish half.  For appetizers, I have tried the sliders and the spinach and artichoke dip. Usually I just get full off the bread but sometimes I like to change things up. The sliders were just okay, I wouldn't order it again. The spinach artichoke dip isn't like the normals ones you get from CPK or Applebees. Here they use real spinach and you can tell. It's good, but I have to admit I like the frozen ""fake"" stuff better. I also tried the stuffed mushrooms which are not on the appetizer menu but instead on small plates and snack menu. They are really good. I recommend order from the ""snacks"" menu to compliment your bread while you wait for the main course.  The pasta menu, that is what I usually order. I tried most of their pasta and they are all very good. My favorite is the Louisiana chicken pasta. Spicy and yummy and PERFECTION. Its so good. MUST try. My second favorite is the Pasta Da Vinci which is full of mushrooms and I love MUSHROOMS. Avoid this pasta if you hate mushrooms. The sauce is different from a cream based or tomato based sauce. Always nice to change it up! The Alfredo here is just okay, I wouldn't order it just because I love CPK's better. I rather get the garlic noodles which is a bit healthier since it doesn't have a cream based sauce. REMEMBER the pasta portions are HUGE I recommend you share. Even if you come during lunch, the lunch sizes are huge too but the price is cut down.  Moving on the MEAT. I have tried some chicken dishes here and my favorite is the crispy chicken costoletta. You won't be disappointed. You get the fresh asparagus and mashed potatoes... So good. Usually I don't like lemon based sauces, but this was so delicious. Love it. The shepherd's pie is okay. Their burgers are MEH. Let's just say you don't come to cheesecake factory just to order a burger. Their fries are stringy too. I don't like that. I also tried their California Cheesesteak. It was really greasy and drenched in oil. It was dripping. Kinda made me sick to my stomach. Wouldn't try it again.  As for salads, I have only tried the Caesar and the Factory chopped salad under the appetizer salad menu. Because their salads are HUGE as well, it was smart to order from the appetizer salad menu. I really liked the chopped salad. Some people think that it looks like baby food cause it's all chopped up, but it was really good. I got everything into my mouth with just once scoop. It was delicious the vinagrette was savory and tasteful. I would go back and try their regular salads as well.   Moving on to desserts! Now you GOT to know that you're getting cheesecake when you're here. I mean there is NO point whatsoever to come to cheesecake factory and NOT get dessert. They will look at you like you're crazy... Okay, maybe not, but I would.. My all time favorite cheesecake is the White chocolate raspberry truffle. Its like heaven in your mouth. I LOVE it. So delicious and not too sweet. Best cheesecake EVER. My second favorite is the red velvet, then the 30th anniversary and lastly the brownie sundae. You won't be disappointed in whatever you choose GUARANTEED.

However, if it's late and you want some semi quality food at a decent price, this is a good place to come to.

Laura G.,"Newark, United States",8,6,1,2.0,22/7/2008,"We received a gift card to this place a year and a half ago, but never went because the wait is always ridiculously long. However, my family and I went on Monday night around 5:15, and the wait was only five minutes. I guess that is the time to go if you don't want to wait.  At first glance, we were overwhelmed with the size of the menu. My thoughts are when the menu is too big, how can the food be specialized? Anyway, we ended up making our selections. My daughter's (ages 3 and 5) liked their cheese, avocado and bacon omelet (can't really mess that up), but thought the potatoes were too spicy because of the red pepper all over them. I thought my Chicken Avocado Sandwich was delicious and I was pleased with my meal. However, my husband did not feel the same. His Arnold Palmer had some black ""floaters"" in it that appeared to be rotten produce of some kind. Furthermore, it the middle of eating his Seared Tuna Salad, he discovered a long curly hair entangled in his lettuce. Yuck! The manager was nice and took it off of our bill.  We took home some cheesecake, since the mood had changed drastically since our arrival. I did not enjoy the Tres Leches Cheesecake. The wet cake on the bottom of cheesecake tasted too mushy for me. but the Tiramisu Cheesecake was delicious. Overall, I think the decor is light and cozy and our server, Stephanie, was super sweet.

Came here after a long day of work and shopping (and because the line was too long at pizza antica). There was a 15 minute wait, so I watched the dozens of people come and go after picking up a slice of cake. Mm...cake.  When we were seated, I found our waiter pretty entertaining and friendly. I glanced at the nutritional facts in that giant booklet of theirs, and I was kind of horrified how many of their meals were almost over the daily intake of calories. Gahhh.. totally put me off... I mean....how is that possible? It took us awhile to figure out what we wanted, because the menu is like a hundred billion pages, but its nice when you can't figure out what you really feel like. I ended up just getting a fettucini alfredo, and my boyfriend got the cashew chicken meal.  The fettucini was nothing to write home about, but then again I didn't expect it to be... I just had a craving for some creamy pasta. I really liked the flavoring of the cashew chicken, but the chicken was a tad overcooked and hard.  The portions are GINORMOUS (hence why the calorie intake is so large). I really think they should consider making their portions smaller... what a waste of food.

I've been to many locations and this seems to be the best and most consistent wit their food, as well as their servers. Either that or I just come here often enough that I end up getting the same servers time and time again.  Here's a review of dishes I've had here: Avacado eggroll: Best avacado eggroll I've had. I was always hesitant to try it because the dipping sauce looks rather intimidating. For someone who is not a fan of ""greens"", it looked a little bit like pesto. Of course it tastes nothing like pesto, but rather a really sweet candied flavor. Compliments the avacado eggroll perfectly.  Caesar salad/factory chopped salad: Very generous portions. I always get the appetizer portion and don't even finish. One thing I love about their salads, it always tastes incredibly fresh. Only part that doesn't always seem fresh are the occasional stale croutons.  Miso Salmon: I know everyone generally raves about this dish, and rightfully so! Whatever they put in that miso sauce is amazing. It's so subtle and doesn't overpower the salmon at all.  Chicken Maderia: Chicken and mashed potatoes, can't go wrong with that. If I'm hungry enough this is usually my go to dish.  Crispy spicy beef: I've only had this dish once. It's one of those dishes you can only have in small portions. By the 5th piece of beef, it can be somewhat overwhelming.  Cheesecake, dulce de leche, ALWAYS. Their whipped cream is freshly made, which makes the topping that much better.

In the end, the food was bland and wasn't very good, the cheesecake definitely was their only highlight but the pasta i had wasn't worth the money. Nothing tasted fresh, I am certain most of the food here is prepared with frozen ingredients or pre-made somewhere else. Did some catering in the past and know ""frozen"" products when i see it.

You have to flip through a spiral notebook with a lot of advertisements. However everything is yummy!  3) There is a huge selection of desserts which around $8 a slice. 4) Cakes and desserts are available to go and you can order entire cakes! These run anywhere from $25-55 a cake. It's all good! 5) Salads are huge!

Jessica S.,"Thornton, United States",13,3,,4.0,4/10/2008,"My first time going to the Cheesecake Factory was pretty good. I was really intimidated by the menu, which was really a book. I didn't like that it was so small and there were three or four pages of entrees. I couldn't compare descriptions well, so I ended up just choosing something off the chicken page. The fact that there were ads in the menu was also pretty strange. Given the prices and the traffic there (there were at least 1015 occupied tables or so around 2.30pm-3pm while we were there), you would think Cheesecake Factory could afford to print their menus without having advertisers. I got the Orange Chicken, which was pretty good. It basically tasted like Chinese food that you could get anywhere, but was still good. It was a hefty portion, even ordered off the lunch menu. My boyfriend got a burger and he was raving over it the whole time. I wanted some dipping sauce for my fries (I got fries instead of white rice and veggies that were actually peas and carrots) and it took forever to flag down our server. She maybe refilled our drinks once. I'm not sure why she was so busy, as it appeared that she only had three occupied tables in her section. I had to get dessert because, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. I got Tirimisu Cheesecake which was amazing. It was too rich for me to eat all at once, so I got half boxed up and ate it later. Overall, it was pretty good. I'll be going back, though I'll make sure to go at lunchtime.

It was a Tuesday night and the Cheesecake Factory wasn't very busy. We were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our waitress took drink orders, brought bread out, and then took meal orders. After doing all that, she disappeared. We ran out of bread and water, thus, started looking for her to ""serve"" us. Since we couldn't find her, we asked a busboy to grab us some bread and another waiter was so kind to refill the water. Thanks! Our waitress comes back to take orders at the other tables, but doesn't bother to check on our table. Great! She now brings out some of the meals, however; she doesn't have mine. She doesn't say anything and just walks away. Common courtesy would have been to let me know that my food will be out shortly, but no.. she just left.

The wait times here are horrendous during peak hours. Everyone hates how the range of those electric light-em-up buzzers don't last to the Macy's next door, much less the mall indoors. Service is inconsistent due to the huge crowds and multiple large parties. So why the four stars?  IT CLOSES AT 12:30AM ON A SATURDAY.

See! Starting to sound appetizing? Sacrilegious as that statement may be?  Hungry after a little barhopping at Santana Row, it's conveniently right across Stevens Creek Blvd at the Valley Fair mall. Coming in this late there's no line and the place was pretty relaxed and lowkey. They do stop taking orders around midnight but they didn't rush us to leave after our plates arrived. We were able to recoup in a comfortable booth sipping some Tumi tea, with the hot water in out pots promptly refreshed from our friendly and courteous waiter.  The appetizers here are pretty good, from the gooey oh so delicious melt-in-your-mouth ""Avocado Eggrolls"", to the ""Salmon Spring Rolls"" served atop a bed of shredded red cabbage and topped with a gingery soy sauce so yummy, I had at one time contacted the franchise corporate office asking if I could buy a bottle (they were kind in their reply but wouldn't give it). I usually eat this whole thing like a salad. And of course, their cheesecakes are sinfully delicious. I've never caught onto their main courses, pastas, or salads here. And the nutritional guide can be jawdropping. Some of the things you'd think were healthier, like stuffed dates, have double the calories of the onion rings. Kid's portion pasta alfredo has 1800+ calories. That's a scary thing to feed a child.  But overall, compared to the limited options in the nearby area, this is was a great and relaxing way to wind down a boozy night in the local area.  Note: Oh, and be careful. 4-inch heels with no tread are going to slip all over the polished tiled floors here.

I guess because it's of other people's choice, but damn what a headache to come here, especially on the weekends. First off they don't take reservations so don't bother trying to have a birthday dinner here with large parties, you're just going to give yourself gray hair. So when I headed to the front to let the hostess know dinner for 7 (which isn't A LOT of people) she gave me a pager and said, ""for your large party, you're going to have to wait for a manager, and he'll give you a quote on how long your wait is"". Okay?! I have to wait for someone to tell me how long the wait really is, cool. While we waited, we just sat there in the lobby taking in ambiance and watching other people wait still thinking wow, why don't they take reservations. Total wait time was about a half hour which was acceptable (mind you I've waited an hour plus before) had we'd been told but while waiting absolutely no manager came out to ""greet us and tell us when our table was ready"" Anyways we were seated in a booth fitting 6 so my girlfriend's dad had to sit on a wicker chair at the head of the table. For $150 not including tip; our party got 7 entrees, 1 appetizer, 3 drinks, a free birthday cake the size of a baby's fist that didn't include cheesecake, inattentive service unless they overheard us, creepy manager guy looking over the wall that surrounded us, a birthday song for my girlfriend's little sister, and hella to go boxes. Considering I was the only one to finish my food, I wondered if my girlfriend's family even liked theirs. I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic which was yummy as always, but what brings me to give this place 1 star so easily is the freaking service. Do these people get underpaid? Or maybe they just don't care? I thought one of the things we were so suppose to learn from the recession was that no job is safe and that everyone should work harder for what they currently possess.

Wayne Q.,"Berkeley, United States",58,410,230,4.0,1/8/2010,"I have always loved Cheesecake Factory since its humble beginnings in the '80s.  This particular location, maybe during these tough times, doesn't seem to have much of a wait for lunch.  On a recent visit, I ordered a chicken-pasta something or other that just did not taste right at all.  Since we were in a bit of a rush, I didn't really complain and tried to eat it.  The chicken was just too hard and dry.  When the waitress returned to collect plates, she took a look at my plate and asked whether everything was OK.  I then told her about the chicken, and she immediately went and told her manager.  She came back, and I guess had even taken a bite herself and was in agreement that it was not up to par at all.  They ended up comping us a free slice of cheesecake, which was a very nice gesture. Sure-fire dishes every time are the Spicy Cashew Chicken and the Avocado Egg Rolls.  You may need to request bread, which I also think is really good. Of the three or four Cheesecake Factorys in the SF Bay Area, my favorite is still the one in Corte Madera (see my review for that location).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1040

Kimmy N.,"San Jose, United States",135,87,19,2.0,31/1/2010,"First Impressions:  This might be bias, but I hate Cheescake Factory.  No hunger deserves to wait 2 hrs for mediocre food.  Parking at Valley Fair is horrible generally.  I really think people live there, they go shopping, they eat, shop some more, go get a massage at the stands, and then a hair cut, shop and eat again.  Really packed parking lot everyday and almost every hour of everyday. Decor:  It looks like Cheesecake factory.  If you are confuse, please click on this image link here:  Service:  From beginning to end, you get a pager at the front, 45 minutes later they tell you wait to the left, 10 minutes later a host/hostess seats you and makes small talk, 10 minutes later your server comes.  At this time I am ready for some bread because I am so hungry and know what I am going to order.  The server comes and tell you the special for the deal and tries to confuse you. (Not a bad thing), but I wish I would know about the special before I made up my mind an hour ago while waiting.  In general the server was catering, here and there all the time.  Taste:  Bleeehhh.  After reading the novel, you better watch out.  I have hit a few grenades eating at this and other cheesecakes.  When I mean grenades, I mean horrible food!  There are some that are decent.  The Louisiana pasta is ok. Specialty:  This might be really obvious, the cheesecake. Price: $25/person (with dessert) Recommendations:   I love their seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecake (not very fond of the Pumpkin Pecan).  I also like the dulce leche, Godiva, oh what the heck, I love them all.  I would Cheesecake give it 2.75 stars if you didn't have to wait for an hour, no novel menu, and not so many grenades on the menu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1040

It reminds me of my hometown where it is fairly common to wait atleast 45 minutes for a table. My first visit to Cheesecake factory included a 2 hour wait for a table. Yes, 2 hours. Well they actually gave us a tiny table in an hour and 45 mins but we opted to wait another 15 mins for a booth to open up. Service at the reception is really terrible...it should be on a first come first serve basis and not on the number of people in the party. We were just 2 and a lot of big groups were getting seated before us even though they came in after. Onto the food. Yummy bread basket, friendly server, good food, average portion size (thought the richness of the food fills you up). We ordered the avocado spring rolls (simply yumilicious), crispy artichoke hearts and the roasted vegetable and goat cheese pizza between 2 of us. I really enjoyed the pizza - it had the perfect combination of veggies, cheese and the slightly sweetish crust. This was one of the better tasting pizzas I have had so far in California. This was a drink free dinner as my husband and i are both trying to cut down on empty calories and our bill for the food came to about $33.

Butterfly A.,"San Jose, United States",582,791,410,4.0,14/1/2010,"Today was our anniversary and we were going to go to Reno or Vegas to celebrate but didn't since our cat is very sick now and still in the hospital. I didn't want to go at first but was glad that I did. We shared the avocado egg rolls which are delicious. The cilantro sauce that comes with it is really good too. I also like their fresh sourdough bread and butter. It was soo good that I ate maybe five pieces and three pats of butter. I blew my diet for tonight, but oh well! I haven't had anything this yummy in over a week. Plus, if I don't cheat once in awhile, I'd go insane if I deprive myself of bad carbs too much, lol.  I also got a pina colada and it was pretty good too. My husband got a large bowl of the Mexican tortilla soup. I was sorry that I didn't get that as it looked good. For the entree, I got something I haven't gotten in a long time, the Cajun Jambalaya dish. It comes with chicken and shrimp and is served over pasta. If you'd rather have it served with rice though, you have to tell your server that. I failed to do that today and when I got my dish, I was like, crap! I didn't want to bother the waitress so just ate it anyways. The pasta was OK, but it was a little undercooked. The portion is huge so I ended up taking most of it home.  I didn't eat much of the pasta, so maybe the scale won't reflect that tomorrow. I also ordered the Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake to go. I'm not sure if that's the right name for it, but it's really good! I just might have a few bites later as today is a day to celebrate! I'll be good tomorrow and maybe take a long overdue trip to the mall to get myself something cute to cheer me up and to walk off those extra pounds.  I almost forgot to mention that it tends to be so loud in there, that my husband got away with letting out a huge loud five second fart and bragged about it in the car. I didn't hear it but cracked up when he said it was a juicy one, LOL!

Teno C.,"Fremont, United States",7,3,,4.0,9/11/2009,"F.E.A.S.T. Rating: 3.6 Cheesecake is one of my greatest weaknesses. I like plain cheesecake, cheesecake with toppings, even that cheesecake mix-in-a-box. Thus, I suppose it makes sense that I get around to reviewing Cheesecake Factory, a chain renown for their selections. This review, however, takes into account that they serve other things besides slice o' heaven. Financial (10%) - 4.0 Meal prices are reasonable, especially considering how big portions are. Few main dishes exceed $20, which is about right for a mid-level chain. A slice of cheesecake is pretty expensive (in the $6-8 range), but is big enough to share with a friend or two. Getting whole cheesecakes will give you a good wallet walloping (typically ~$26 for 7"" and ~$50 for 10""). Expression (15%) - 4.0 CF likes to showcase their cheesecakes; that is their strongest point. From the whole pies on display, to the decorative patterns found on individual slices, CF wins the most points for this category with their eponymous dessert. The main courses are cleanly presented, and heaping portions kinda has its own morbidly fun appeal. Speaking of which, they always seem to empty an industrial-sized can of whipped cream onto your slice of cheesecake! Ambiance (20%) - 3.5 Did I walk into a Las Vegas hotel? Familiar wall prints, classical columns...all that's missing is a Roman statue :) The waiting area, cheesecake counter, restrooms, and kitchen doors all share common space. I prescribe a little caution when wading through this overcrowded area. Expect to get to know your neighbors and their food when squeezing into the cramped seating, especially at tables adjacent to the bar where stools are placed almost haphazardly. Service (25%) - 3.5 As I previously mentioned, it's incredibly busy. And that's unfortunate because they don't take reservations. Instead, you're given an ETA and a buzzer device that notifies you when seating becomes available. Typical wait times on a crowded evening are about 45 min. Service can be somewhat uneven due to crowding and hectic pace (a true measure of service when you see how your server reacts in such a dynamic environment). And don't come to CF if your party exceeds 4. They will try to seat you, but expect to add another 30 minutes to that wait time. However, CF staff are genuinely friendly and accommodating. Taste (30%) - 3.5 The food is actually not bad considering the focus on dessert and diverse menu. The only problem I have is that CF tends to get the key flavors wrong (the syrupy sauces may be to blame). The Crispy Spicy Beef has so much potential, but is salty despite the sweet-spicy sauce. The Spicy Cashew Chicken is sweeter than it is spicy. On the other hand, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp struck almost all the right notes despite its funny name haha. The curry, peanuts, chiles, and coconut surprisingly don't overpower each other. I'm also a fan of their breads. What about cheesecakes that I already haven't mentioned? I brought a White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake to a picnic once and ppl refused to let it thaw. Gone in 60 seconds!

I had the Portabella Mushroom burger with no cheese (vegan here) and my friend had the pull apart pork sandwich.  My burger was delicious but my friend's pork had alot of fat in it (pork?) The service was great and the restaurant was well organized. I would go back in a minute.  I would also want Renee for dessert next time!  Hmmmm!

And of course, being called ""cheesecake"" factory, they do offer a diverse menu of cheesecakes. Being a large american franchise restaurant though, you can expect to wait quite a bit to be seated. BUT if you come in late enough there wouldn't be much of a wait anymore... I especially like their little appetizer menu which isn't too shabby. There are a few different things to choose from there and the price ain't to bad for a nice little serving. Their fried zuchini is pretty tasty. Anyhow, I don't consider the prices too bad, and the portions are good. You'll probably be saving a lot of money by picking a few things and sharing it with another person. Afterall, these portions are meant for one person alone...obsesity! Oh, my favorite cheesecake is their fresh banana cream.

While the food is disappointing, the prices make it even worse. I have friends you who keep dragging me here, so I keep trying different things on the menu.

And it was perfect because my brother came to join our mall excursion and we'd all be able to dine together. I suggested The Cheesecake Factory since they'd never been there before and because my mom is a cheesecake lover. We were seated promptly and arrived just in time to take advantage of the lunch portion options. We ordered 2 lunch portions of pasta with shrimp and 2 cheeseburgers. When our dishes arrived, we were given 3 pasta dishes and 1 cheeseburger...... Me: Excuse me, we ordered 2 cheeseburgers and 2 pasta dishes. Server: Uh, no you ordered 3 pasta dishes. That's why I asked you if you wanted a lunch portion. Me: (Looking around at my family in confusion) Didn't you hear me order a burger? Mom: Yeah. Sister: (Being such a sweetheart) It's okay, I'll just have the pasta. And the server never apologized or offered to fix the error. Instead of being too proud and/or lazy, she should have insisted on correcting her mistake. I was pissed. Two days passed and I was still pissed. I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager, explaining what had happened.

Natalie C.,"Cupertino, United States",299,8,3,2.0,13/1/2011,"Went here with my friend for a late dinner on Wednesday night. Normally cheesecake factory is our first choice for late night food for nights that we work late because of the super-friendly service. This was the first time they really disappointed us. We sat down in the bar area and after about fifteen minutes a server walks up and says ""Oh, well here is one menu, I'll go get one more."" He had a strangely rude, monotonous kind of voice. He came back after a couple minutes with another menu and said something about specials and soup, but I couldn't make out one word to the next he was speaking so quickly. Oh, well! He sort of hovered by the bar looking in our direction for a while and then skipped over to our table and said, ""Oh yeah, did you guys want something to drink? Maybe water or something?"" Um, hi. BAR AREA. Normally at cheesecake factory we're asked every five minutes or so if we want another drink. Gotta make money somehow, I suppose.  We went through with our order and a really sweet girl brought it out. She was probably the highlight of our night. She was super friendly and made it seem like she actually wanted to get us what we wanted. We weren't sure when we'd see our server again so we asked her for extra everything!  My friend got the tex mex eggrolls, which I liked but he thought they were pretty average. We'll stick to cheap chili's over those. The worst part though, I got the ""nachos with spicy chicken"" spicy? No. Flavor? No. Temperature? Right out of the fridge. Along with the rest of the nachos.. I've had nachos all over the place, but not once have I been served cold chicken on cold chips with unmelted cheese. Weird. So I ate around the edges until we caught sight of our server maybe five minutes later. I don't think I was rude to him, I just asked if they could heat it up a little because everything was still cold. He told me ""I'm so sorry about that, don't worry I'll get it fixed and take it off of your check."" Welp. I wasn't expecting to get it free, just warm at least. ANOTHER ten minutes go by and he brings out a new plate of nachos and says that he had them make a whole new plate for me. Unnecessary, but nice. Would've been nicer if half the chips weren't burned to black. Don't mess with people making your food is the lesson I've learned. To top it all off, the check came out and I was charged twice for the nachos and one of them was comp'ed off. I called him over and asked why there was a second charge and he mumbled back that he had to put it in the computer twice and charge me twice. After he had told me I wouldn't have to pay for them, I was a little confused, but he made himself sparse until he came back to pick up the signed receipt.  Disappointing to say the least for cheesecake factory. Moral of the story? If you get stuck at Joshua's table, run!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1180

Good cheesecake... but TOO SWEET. I only felt the cream and sugar. What's the point? 1500 calories for the cake... 1700 calories for my dish... so now what? Should I go make a marathon ? Can't they make something smaller, healthier and tastier? I come from France, so maybe that is why I am picky about food.

They are other restaurants in the bay area, for the same price range (and some with a 1 star at the Michelin Guide), where you can have good quality food, healthier and tastier... and no need to wait 1:30 !

First of all when we arrived, around 1:30pm, the place was hopping.  We went up to the front and said is it possible that we will be able to eat by 8:00pm tonight, and the person said if its just the two of you, it'll be a 8-10 min wait.  Well, we were seated exactly 10 min later.  We had a wonderful waiter, DRAKE, ask for this guy he's totally professional and very personable.  No he's not a friend or relative.... The food was good as well as the portions.  We split a calamari appetizer, as well as splitting a Chinese Chicken salad.  Plenty of food, and plenty of room for cheesecake.  Drake suggested the Strawberry Cheesecake, which we went with, and it was plenty for two to share.  There was a table next to us that split there cheesecake 4 ways! The burgers looked outrageous, and Drake said if you eat one of those, your done.  So, eat just half of it to save room for the cheesecake. Prices are very reasonable, great service, good size portions of above average food. Would I visit again?? Hey, Yesss!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1260

When I complained to the employee he laughed shrugged his shoulder's and entered the restaurant through the main entrance. This is my second point , why is managment allowing staff members to enter through the front door. Isnt there an employee entrance?

RED MEAT heaven~ aiyah.. i was pissed. i had to pick around my burger to look for the cooked areas. at the end, it looked like raw ground beef. how ironic!! the second waitress noticed that we weren't happy and notified the manager, because he came over and made one of the meals free. he then probably FORCED the original waiter over to apologize because he came over with his careless attitude and quickly said sorry and scurried away. the second time, i was with my family, trying to have a NICE mother's day dinner. the waitress lacked personality and happyness. she was probably tired, but sorry! it's your job, missy, i'm sure you need the tips. suck it up and do your job. she wasn't really great, i had to request for bread twice and she didn't look too happy when taking our otders. it kinda killed my family's mood. thanks a lot!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1460
Kevin C.,"San Jose, United States",98,264,114,2.0,18/8/2008,"the wait:  absolutely horrible, 1 star the service:  slow and forgetful, 2 stars the food (quality):  average, 3 stars the food (quantity):  very good to great, 4 stars the prices:  match the portions, 2 stars The wait is painfully, mercilessly, notoriously long.  We knew this in advance, but foreknowledge doesn't make the wait any shorter.  Our group of eight was waiting from 6:30 to 7:15 on a MONDAY.  Imagine the wait on a weekend.  (And lest you think it's just because we had a big group... small parties had comparably long waits.) Here's something that puzzled me: parties were given pagers while they waited to be seated... but a CF employee was still walking around calling some parties by name.  That seemed amateurish (matching the service to follow). After a long wait in the increasingly crowded (but aptly named) waiting area, our pager buzzed and we reported to the front desk.  And waited some more.  Eventually a sweaty but friendly welcomer in a black polo showed us to a booth in the back.  (Guy could have used an undershirt.)  Only five place settings were on the table, but more were brought after we asked. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly, but service was really slow for the most part.  It was a long wait for beverages and bread, and an even longer wait for the beverage order to be corrected.  Consider that we had already been waiting nearly an hour at this point.  The bread refill took just as long; the place must be really understaffed or something.  Every aspect of service was slow, except the speed-talking of the waitress.  (She was like the Micro Machines guy.) The food quality was average, probably on par with Chili's and the like, but the portions were generous to say the least.  My friend and I shared a BBQ bacon double cheeseburger ($11) and a ""tons of fun"" double cheeseburger ($11).  Impressively large, served with a large side of crisp fries.  Not great, but at least there was a lot.  One friend's chicken was on the dry side, and another's pasta was undercooked (firmer than al dente). It's easy to be floored by the size of the dishes, but the prices are high to match.  $10 for the cheapest cheeseburger, it had better be either great (no) or big (yes).  Huge salads, but they're something like $14.  $20 for the popular miso salmon or steak Diane. As expected, the waitress offered dessert (twice actually), but because of the gargantuan entrees, that was expectedly out of the question. Service was decidedly below average, but groups of seven of more pay a compulsory 18% gratuity.  Meh.  I get that it's a regular policy, but it seems like it gives the waitstaff license to be lousy. What's the deal with the lights getting progressively dimmer?  It went from bright to dark around 7:15, and dark to darker around 8.  I guess it would create a more romantic evening atmosphere, except that guest parties are seated incredibly close to one another.  All-up-ons close.  This is no gentlemen's club; I don't need strange people on my lap. As we left around 8:45, the place was still packed, with people waiting to be seated.  (No, we didn't eat incredibly slowly... the slothlike service was to blame.)  I don't really get why this place is so popular.  The cheesecake, sure... but it's like 6 bucks, 800 calories, and 50 grams of fat per slice.  My wallet and arteries clench just typing that.  Just get a much cheaper (but equally unhealthy) CF frozen cheesecake at Costco... something like $20 instead of $50.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1460

Very Big Minus: The place is LOUD with people talking and background music that is way too much in the foreground.  One of our party asked for the music to be turned down some, but the waitress said they wouldn't do it.  We were at a fairly small table considering there were 7 of us, but we still had to raise our voices pretty high to be able to hear each other.   I had the fish and chips - which was ok.  In retrospect I wish I'd ordered a pasta dish, those that others in my party ordered looked amazing.  For dessert a friend and I split a Dulce de Leche cheesecake.  It was ok.  Not as caramel-y as I'd hoped and WAY too much whipped cream on the plate (seriously you could hardly see the slice of cheesecake), so I'll definitely try a different type next time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1280

I went to the counter and waited, paid and they finally gave me my cheese cake. I graciously took the cake and the Gentleman behind the counter said ""What, no tip?"" And I replied with a smile and said ""Nope.""  I left without telling them that it practically took an act of God to get the cheese cake whereas there was no actualy curb side assistance.  I hope somebody informs the staff that it is completely rude to ask for a tip when the service only consisted of cutting the cake and putting it in a box...",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1280
H T.,"Silicon Valley, United States",158,1024,231,3.0,12/2/2010,"Came here for my yearly Cheesecake Factory outing, what was new to me this year was the calories per slice in their display case. Who would've thought my entire daily caloric intake could be consume by a decadent piece of cheesecake?! sigh. reality is not always pleasant so I chose to skip the cheese cake. Yup, that's right. Didn't even split a piece. Instead just had my usual entree - the portabella mushroom sandwich ($10.95) which was really good (either that or I was really hungry). The service was good and there was a wait (as always at this location) but we were lucky since it was  late in the evening on a Sunday and got seated within 20 minutes. Unfortunately they don't take reservations and you can't call ahead to add your name to the waitlist. Parking is always a challenge here so don't be afraid to park far away - it'll help burn off the thousands of calories you're about to consume.  Bottom line, in all I think it's worthy of 3.5 stars - it's good value for your money, a nice atmosphere, but just wish they had more vegetarian options and a healthier menu but am glad that they at least publicly advertise their nutrition content. yay for honesty.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1280

Chester Y.,"Berkeley, United States",22,12,17,2.0,21/8/2006,"This place looks like they took their design cues from the general look of Tuscan villas then mixed in the vomit of a Cirque du Soleil art director. It's difficult to describe and nobody at the table could figure out what the motif was. Were I to title the aesthetic, I would call it ""Ghetto Bellagio"".  More tackyness came via the laminate-flipbook menus: every couple of pages is an advertisement for one of the businesses in the mall. And it doesn't need further cluttering. One could see that their corporate executive chef wondered to himself, ""should we go with Cal-Ital, Asian fusion, American coffee shop, dessert bakery, or Tex-Mex? Well I'll be damned if you limit me to a menu with any sense of coherency! I can do it all!""  Anyway...  I rather liked my salad. Baby lettuce with a fruity vinaigrette that was maybe a little bit too liberally applied, but well within the boundaries of judiciousness. My parents had an endive-based salad with blue cheese and other interesting leafies.   We all shared the ""Fresh Artichoke Fire-Roasted with a Spicy Vinaigrette"" and the ""Fresh Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Eggroll"" appetizers. The artichoke was quite nice, well-roasted and seasoned, but the avocado eggroll was precisely the disaster you would expect. Cut on the bias, they seemed like floppy spearheads as the eggroll skin was so non-crunchy that it was almost chewy. Normally I wouldn't order something quite so preposterous, but a paternal directive had been handed down, dictating that ""green"" appetizers be chosen. Plus, I was pretty curious as to what an avocado eggroll would taste like.  Anyway, by that point, we'd been reminded of one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Cheesecake Factory: portions so large they are of comical, Dagwoodsian proportions.  The avocado eggroll monstrosity could have been an entree --- and I guess it would be, if anyone were demented enough to eat avocado eggrolls as their main course.  By that point, I don't think a single one of us was actually hungry any longer. I was busy trying to steal water from my father's glass to dilute my strawberry lemonade (which had a syrup/water ratio akin to that of molasses) when our waiter brought out our entrees. For a moment, I forgot whether we were having dinner or staging an eating contest.  I had the ""Honey-Maple Pork Tenderloin,"" which came as a sliced log of pork arrayed on top of three full-sized ice-cream-scoops of dense mashed potatoes. This was flanked by a pound of steamed, diced carrots, and about two pounds of steamed broccoli. My father, a great proponent of prominent vegetable content, almost shat himself in envy when he saw my plate, because his ""Farfalle with Chicken and Mushrooms,"" which was a creamy sea of off-whiteness, nary a fleck of green in sight.  The Moms had the ""Herb Encrusted Filet of Salmon,"" which were two salmon filets leaned up against a scale replica of the Matterhorn, fashioned out of mashed potatoes. M.'s ""Grilled Pork Chops,"" had a similarly-geological mashed potato sierra. At this point, the overarching culinary philosophy of Cheesecake Factory had been illustrated for us: bountiful amounts of mass quantities.  As would be expected, the quantity had an inverse relationship with quality. My pork tenderloin was dry and bland and the sauce's only utility lay in pooling around the broccoli as glaze of cloying slime. The mashed potatoes were too dense and devoid of flavor. The steamed broccoli and carrots were, well, steamed broccoli and carrots --- except for the broccoli, which had been Ghostbustered by the aforementioned syrupy effluvium.  I traded for some of my veggies for some of my dad's pasta. The farfalle was alright, and copious, but the chicken tasted more or less like the steamed vegetables, only with a chicken breast texture. When my mother and I remarked on this, my father said, ""What do you expect? Chicken is chicken.""   Correspondingly, pork is pork. M.'s pork chops tasted like the chicken, only with a pork chop texture. Given that, I didn't feel the need to try any of my brother's chicken marsala, and was downright scared of trying my mother's filet of salmon. I was afraid the salmon would taste like chicken, only with salmon texture. Had that been the case, frankly, it would have freaked me out.  The good thing was that our tiramisu cheesecake tasted like tiramisu cheesecake, and not like chicken with a cheesecake texture. Actually, in all seriousness, it was pretty damn good. But, by then, it wasn't feasible to eat much of anything else.   And that's the story at Cheesecake Factory: everyone brings home a bunch of food in leftover boxes, packaged nicely enough that one almost wants to eat the same shitty food the next day.  [Note: This was a write-up from a visit four years ago. But the point of a chain is to be consistent, even if in mediocrity.]",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1280

I tried the Chicken Madeira, which comes topped with mushrooms and asparagus and a huge side of mashed potatoes. It was delicious! The chicken was so tender and infused with the sauce.

batu b.,"San Jose, United States",0,32,,1.0,16/7/2008,"My wife and I went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner tonight.  We had a $50 gift card, so it was an excellent chance to immerse ourselves in a culture that we weren't really familiar with. Simply put, the Cheesecake Factory is Not Good.  It's all sugar and fat and salt and pepper.  The Steak Diane basically tasted the same as the Shrimp Scampi.  It's amazing - one was dark red color, the other pale color, one from land, one from sea, but they all sort of blended together into one sweet, salty flavor.  I think there is a corporate directive to never use the term ""bitter"" lest that sensation enter into the food and provide a modicum of balance.  The Gin rickey tasted like something from 7-11.  Ditto on the pineapple pisco sour.  Props for having pisco at the bar, drops for it being reduced to a condiment for a fruit punch. Speaking of condiment, it may be that the quality reference for everything is ketchup. For example, our Ahi Tuna Carpaccio was some thin slices of ahi tuna, drenched in some sort of Thousand Island dressing (without the relish bits), served on a square plate to help enhance the Asian influence. I'm guessing the fish was too dark a red, so they had to lighten up the color towards the ketchup ""normal,"" adding this sweet, mayonaissey substance to correct it. Also speaking of condiment, one of the burgers (we did not order this) offers steak AND bacon as a topping.   Not just meat-on-meat, but meat-on-meat-on-meat.   The interior is like some mid-range vegas strip encounter.  Smooth Jazz piped in from the high ceiling.  Full page glossy advertisements populated many pages throughout the expansive menu. Besides the letter ""e"", the most common characters were ""®"" and ""™"", indicating the proprietary names of their menu items or the trademarks of the brands incorporated into an offering (such as ""Snickers™ Delight Cheesecake""). More than a dining experience, the CCF offers a parody of America, with it's diverse clientele, profit-at-every-opportunity (ads in the menu??), and ethnic-influenced menu that takes a variety of flavors and makes them all the same.

This place is pretty good, but for the quality of the food (excluding the cheesecake), I think we pay way too much. It's tough to rate because I'm not sure what the Cheesecake factory is supposed to be... It's ""formal"" in design, but the food reminds me of Hometown Buffet (fried mac n cheese, spaghetti, bad lemonade). The only thing that saves this place is the fact that they have amazing desserts. Pumpkin, Macadamia, Cookie Dough and regular cheesecake flavors are my favs. And, cheesecake is the place my old cheer friends and I go when we meet up while college is out (Motions All Star National Champions!!!), so it's kinda sentimental. If you can find a different place to go, go there... oh, and the service is HORRIBLE. I've gone prob like 12+ times, and not once have I had better than mediocre service. I've had drinks spilled (by the same waitress!) TWICE in my food and then NOT bring me a new one (pasta davinci was swimming in a pool of lemon water), not even comp me a desert or anything.

One of the best hamburgers I have ever had. My wife had the factory chopped salad which was pretty good but I would not have it as a main course for dinner(maybe split it). They have two types of Sangria, red and white. I like them both. Try the white one if you like sangria. We also had the strawberry shortbread with ice cream for dessert which was very good. The service was a solid 5 stars, thanks to Jerod. We have also tried the cheesecake Factory in palo alto, and it was excellent. This is one of the few chain restaurant that I like.

T Y.,"San Francisco, United States",0,11,2,1.0,19/11/2011,"Really disappointed with the GM of this Cheesecake Factory. Took my mom for a celebration dinner, and we were having a great time, but unfortunately for us a waiter tripped and pasta sauce went flying over mom. She felt a shower of cold sauce on her neck and hair, and had spots of the red! sauce on her wool coat (which was draped over her chair) as well as on her shirt and jeans. The waiter did apologize, and we know mistakes happen. Our waiter offered us a dry cleaning, and the manager came over and apologized and told us to come back with the dry cleaning bill for them to cover, which we accepted. We left right away as my mom needed a shower ASAP, got our barely eaten food to go,paid for our dinner and tipped generously, of course, as it was not our waiter's fault. However, it was embarrassing for my mother because we noticed the couple sitting next to us could not contain their laughing at the spilling of spaghetti sauce over my mom.To the couple: I don't see what is so funny about it, but thank you for your insensitivity. Needless to say it wasn't a very enjoyable night at the Cheesecake Factory Went to the dry cleaners and the owner stated he ""wasn't sure the stains would come out"", and was pretty sure the ""smell would not come out"". He said there was a way to get it out, but it would cause the jacket to shrink too much, which may make it too tight to wear. He also said in his experience, the restaurants were supposed to reimburse you with cash for the dry cleaning immediately, and was surprised this establishment did not do so. He said that what he has seen with his customers in some incidents were that restaurants conveniently had a ""short memory"" when it came to accidents like this, and would not reimburse if they did not recall such an incident. But we didn't know that, and of course, it wouldn't occur to us to demand cash on the spot, nor would it look very good on our part. The dry cleaners said he would do his best to clean it though. The jacket is not Chanel or anything I admit, but I got it for her for her birthday, so you can see why we were concerned. Anyway, my mom called the General Manager, who was rude. Said if the dry cleaning place ""claimed"" it could not be fixed that we can bring it over to him and they will clean it.  Acted like we were trying to get money out of it and that he was doing us a favor already by offering to dry clean.  Personally I think that is an expectation, not a favor. She tried to explain accidents happened, not here to report anybody (didn't even have the waiter's name) but was just concerned about what would happen if the dry cleaning could not remove the large stains of spaghetti sauce over her clothes. He did not want to listen, never once said he was sorry and acted too busy to attend to the mistakes of his staff. Really disappointed with the handling of this experience. An apology would have sufficed.

My friend and I finally got seated after a long day of spending way too much money. The wait here is always long-ish, so be prepared for that. I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, which is really awesome. The food arrived and we started to dig in. After a few bites, I noticed a short straight hair on the other side of my pasta (the side I wasn't eating form, Thank God.

A minute later a manager came by and apologized for the incident and assured me it was an isolated event, which I did believe them. She asked if I wanted to order the same thing or something else, which I ended up choosing the Pasta Da Vinci. She offered me a soup or salad while I waited and I declined (I'm already eating carbs, do i need any more food in my belly?). It was a nice gesture, however and I did appreciate it. My original server came by and apologized for the incident as well, even though it was not her fault. Ten minutes later, another manager brought out my food and apologized. I really appreciated everyone's efforts and they handled the situation well. By the time the server brought our bill, she had taken off my pasta. It was extremely nice of her to do so, and I was prepared and expecting to pay for my meal, since everything turned out fine. She did not have to do so, but she insisted, so she got one big fat tip from us. The managers and the servers were extremely nice and remorseful about the incident, and I would definitely come back again.  Final Verdict: Despite the long wait, you should still come here.

THE MENU HAS ADS?! It's already a book of a menu and then you have all these ads to look through. Annoying.  I now prefer restaurants to have a more refined/specialized menu as the food usually tastes better.  I'd love to see the nutrition facts for this place..

He was very nice and listened to our every need. It did not bother him that we had some late folks and he assured us it isnt a problem. Water glasses were always filled and he was always near the table to answer any question and fullfill any need. All of the food tasted great. It came out super fast (again, despite the business of the restaurant) and not a single person had a complaint.  I got a free birthday sunday with my name spelled out on it even and I was sung to!

Had the Miso Salmon for lunch today.  The salmon was nicely flavored with a mix of teriyaki and miso flavors and four small sugar pea pods.  Among the other entrees that looked interesting were the lettuce wrap and Chicken Madeira.  The server indicated that the Chicken Madeira is among their more popular dishes and that the Miso Salmon was their most popular seafood entree. Service was a bit odd as the servers remove your glass from the table and come back with it later. In the few, occasional instance where I've had room for dessert in the past, I found the cheesecake very good - but served in a portion size a bit too large.  Last time I had a slice of their cheesecake I split it with two other people.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1560

Phil W.,"South San Francisco, United States",357,67,32,4.0,29/3/2007,"People complain about this one and the one in the city, yet its always packed and both get a ton of reviews so obviously a lot of people still go. I like this one much better than Union Square. The line is much shorter and the service is way better. Considering how packed both get, I don't see why they just don't open a few more. Probably the whole less is more attitude, like In and Out. I like the food. Yes they have a lot to choose from, but I'm a really good chooser. Everyone always ask me to choose and I haven't let them down yet. I totally adore their appetizers. My favorites are the spicy ahi tempura rolls, tex-mex rolls, and firecracker salmon rolls. I guess I have a thing for rolls. I've tried the sliders, fried mac & cheese, and calamari. Those are more or less ok, great for sharing. I'd definitely stay away from the popcorn shrimp, all batter no shrimp. The chicken strips can sometimes be a little cold in the center, I guess they haven't figured out the microwave cook times yet. The potstickers I'm sure came from right out of bag someone picked up at Ranch 99 before coming into work. Otherwise, let's move on to entrees. Their menu is like ""everything you wanted to ever eat and more."" You can really sit here for 20 minutes pondering over the menu, especially if you're hungry, everything sounds good. Seriously, you can really get anything here, chicken done 96 ways, beef done another 49 ways, and way more pastas than you can imagine. I've been here at least 20 times and I'm not even half way through their menu, believe me when I say I eat off everyone's plate at my table.  A couple of high and low lights: Kobe burger- American Kobe is no where near Japanese Kobe, not worth the premium in price. I would say something along the lines of top instead of fatty sirloin. Shepards Pie- I can make this with a can of Chunky beef and vegetable soup and some instant potatoes. Soggy and bland. Grilled portabello on a bun- bread and mushrooms, go figure.  Beef Goulash- Must be what was eaten in a gulag for all those people to die of malnutrition. Tasteless, beef was way over-cooked and not tender at all, sauce a bit runny. Shrimp Scampi- pretty tasty, a little on the oily side, but well flavored with plenty of garlic and parsley, quite buttery, great with practically anything. Cajun Jambalaya- very good, spicy and rich, almost authentic taste, loaded with chicken and shrimp, great over rice. Cajun-style Ribeye- it says marinated for 36 hours, tastes great, very even taste throughout the meat, have it rare you won't regret it. One of the best cajun steaks I've had outside of Vegas.  Overall I'm usually quite satisfied with the meals I've had here. Compared to Union Square, it's at least half the wait time. On weekday early evenings, I can usually get a table within 10 minutes. Oh I almost forgot, the cheesecake. They have about 30 different kinds of cheesecake here, the consistency is excellent, I like mine usually a little thick and firm with the crust slightly moist. I find most of their specialty cheesecakes to be a tad too sweet for my Asian taste buds so I still with the original. Do not, under any circumstances, get the 6 carb diet cheesecake. It really tastes like bad cardboard, as opposed to good cardboard you find in the freezer section of your local supermarket. If you're counting carbs, you shouldn't even be in this restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1560

I hadn't been here in ages and I'd forgotten how HUGE the portions are. I had a lunch size salad and it was pretty much the regular dinner portion at a normal restaurant. I'd imagine the regular sized salads could be split amongst like three people. I had the Pasta Da Vinci cos I would never make it at home as they don't typically sell madeira pasta sauce in jars at the grocery store, and I quite liked it. The chicken was a bit dry though. This place has such a huge menu with EVERYTHING on it (""Mexican"", ""Thai"", ""English"", American...) and a full bar, but I don't really like cheesecake, their meat is usually dry, and they just don't do anything exceptionally well.

The service was OK.  The employees ODed on the schmoozing, and were not all that great at the details. The food was just like every other Cheesecake factory to me; overrated with unfathomably high calorie counts (if something has that many calories it better taste damn good!).  This last week when I went here I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  It was pretty good, and came with some tasty mash potatoes and asparagus that I didn't eat.  However, they have a pretty similar dish at BJ's that I think tastes much better and is much cheaper as well.   To finish off my meal, I got a slice of strawberry cheesecake.  This was the forth dessert item I have tried from the Cheesecake factory over the last two weeks, and I was not impressed by any of them.  I honestly believe that the frozen Cheesecake factory cakes that you can buy at your local supermarket taste better than the ones at the actual restaurant.  Strange, I know.  I just think their desserts are overrated.

Nothing at Cheesecake Factory is memorable and worth ordering twice. A few nights ago, a friend and I came in just to grab a glass for wine. Wow, my wine was obviously in the fridge for a while because it tasted like shit and I've had that particular wine before but ewww, no quality control here!?!?  The alfredo we shared was watery and disgusting. Two people couldn't even finish one plate. Honestly, there are so many better chain restaurants if that is what you're in the mood for.

Got to our booth , got the specials spiel, ordered our drinks asked for a few minutes to decide and....waited.  Ten minuted later we were able to order our spicy beef and Shepperd's pie and again...... waited.  Another ten minutes and another waiter arrived to ask if we wanted bread and water, brought just the bread and retook our order this time with additional soup and salad. These arrived promptly and the soup was great.  25 minutes later the remainder of our meal arrived.  Upon my asking why the delay, was told the computer system had lost our order.  Well, having done a stint as a waiter in a previous life, it looked and tasted like our deep fried crispy spicy beef has sat around for way too long under the heat lamps.  Like old shriveled french fries that you reheat in the micro just 'cause you're hungry.  The Shepard's Pie as the previous reviewer noted was just plain flavorless with raw julienned carrots that needed to be bite sized added as an afterthought.  The inaccurate bill arrived, I paid with the appropriate tip added and left the brightly lit overly staffed restaurant  feeling quite disappointed.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1600

Both pasta dishes, despite being incredibly rich and creamy, were not very flavourful.  The hamburger, again, was massive, but there was absolutely nothing memorable about it.

Sometimes I really like the fact that when I go to Cheesecake Factory I know what to expect and what kind of food I'll get. Since I've been going there for years I know exactly what to order and I know it'll be good. My usuals are the Miso Salmon or the Hibachi Steak. I've tried other food but have found that I don't like them as much as I like those. As for the cheesecake, suprisingly I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake at all, but I do like the Tres Leches and the Raspberry Truffle.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1340

The portions are big so we ended up splitting the lettuce wraps, caesar salad, herb salmon & cajun jumbulaya pasta for 6 people & we had leftovers :)  The food was all reallyyyy good. & the lettuce wraps & caesar salad were not oily at all. the other ones were a bit unhealthy but if you split, you feel less guilty :) The cheesecake is obviously amazing but we had the carmel pecan one & the strawberry one (the strawberry was good!) the carmel pecan one wasnt as good as most people say cheesecake from here is supposed to be...but i dont like caramel much either  The wait time was great! We came in at 8 at were seated in literally 5 minutes!  We had two waitresses because the first one had to go on break, they were both great but i cannot put into words how AMAZING THE FIRST WAITRESS WAS. she was so nice & helpful & gave us her honest opinion  on dishes (not just suggesting expensive stuff) A little pricey but great for special occasions.

Let me tell you this...we were so disappointed. The hamburgers were alright, but the cheese was kind of eh. When I was served the quesadilla I was very confused with the absence of chicken it. I asked the server what happened and he said they did not add chicken to their quesadillas. It was kind of annoying because on the menu it says they can add chicken in it if you ask. Our pizza wasn't the best, my group agreed it could have been better. Our salad was as if they had plated it and left it for a long time, it was not enjoyable.

The Cheesecake Factory has a LOT of items to choose from their long menu. I even found it surprising that they place ads ON their menu! What's up with that?

Our bartender/waitress was very pleasant and handed us our menus. I ordered for the two of us since my bf didn't really know what was good...me being a show off ordered for both of us since I always stick to two main items and refuse to ever try anything different. of course the complimentary bread and butter is a perfect starter..no need for appetizers for us....so back to what we ordered: 1. Chicken Madeira 2. Miso Salmon ""Oh Em Geee....now that's good food!  ""  is all my bf kept saying all night.     Indeed it was great. It's always great food because again, i refuse to try anything different.  maybe i will one day when i'm open to being disappointed..nah, i don't think i would but these two dishes are just too darn great.

Upon eating our Thai Lettuce Wrap appetizer, I bit down on something hard. It turned out to be one of those plastic tabs that hold bread bags together. I immediately called a waiter over. A manager came by to tell us that the appetizer was going to be ""taken care of"". Later, the waitress lagged on serving us, more particularly, taking 10-15 minutes to fetch a simple glass of wine. Again, it took another 10-15 minutes to receive the bill, and when we did, we found that the appetizer was still on the bill. I then asked to speak to a manager. All he offered was to ""take care"" of the appetizer, to which, I gave him a look of awe and anger. He then offered free cheesecake, to which i gave him another look of dissatisfaction. I then said to him, ""You're the manager. You obviously want to take care of the customer. What do you feel is necessary to do so?"" He ended up giving us a 30 dollar gift card which only covered half of our meal. This also took another 10 minutes to get. Not only that, but we ended up not being able to go to see a movie, which we've been planning on seeing for over a month. Furthermore, one of the servers disclosed the fact that another customer found a rubberband in his broccoli the other day. In summary, they (the Cheesecake Factory) are lucky that a little child or anyone else did not choke on that plastic tab.

Jasmin J.,"San Leandro, United States",51,46,8,2.0,7/9/2010,"I was excited to have dinner at the Valley Fair Cheese Cake Factory being that I had never been there before. It was my girlfriends 19th birthday and she had a party of 28. Being that none of the restaurants take reservation she got there and hour early to make her ""in-person"" reservation at 6:30. Time went by an as 7:30 rolled around the hostess told her and her guest we would be waiting 45 minutes to be seated. Some of our party went into the mall to shop a bit, came back and its now 8:30. Still not seated. At this point 2 of our guest left and hostess where telling us the party in the section for us had just put in there order. Note that my friend put in her reservation at 6:30. I don't understand WHY we did not get seated till 10! 4 hours of waiting. It did not take this party ahead of us 4 hours to eat. On top of that all we paid our check in full and the waitress somehow add and additional $56.98 to our tab when the check CLEARLY had the TAX and TIP printed clear on the check. The manager paid for 2 appetizers and the birthday girls cheesecake. 2 appetizers! For a 26 guest party. I'm very upset about the extra fee our party had to throw in last minute and it didn't seem like the waitresses waiting us were very happy at our large party. Its unacceptable that it took 4 hours for us to be seated and looks 2 of our guest in the process. I will not be attending San Jose/Santa Clara Cheese Cake Factory any time soon and will tell all my loved ones to do that same. Not good for big partys...

Puchu ..,"San Jose, United States",12,89,,1.0,9/5/2006,Horrible food in large quantities.  Really the only reason to ever go here is because you are in a very large group and are unable to do a walkin anywhere else.  Hmm.  Maybe getting takeout and crashing somewhere might be better then going to Cheesecake Factory.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1520
Jeff H.,"San Francisco, United States",1,93,11,3.0,17/12/2008,"I had a relatively enjoyable experience at this place.  It took us a while to realize that this place isn't actually connected to the mall.  I walked all over the mall and had to ask the information booth.  Now I know.   Once inside, we had to wait just a bit for a table.  I can't imagine going to this place Friday - Sunday.  We were seated in the area next to the bar; I would have preferred an area less open and loud.  Yeah, the restaurant decor looks fabulous but I don't pay attention to things like that.  I care primarily about food, followed by service. I was amazed by the vastness of the menu.  I think its ridiculous to have such a large menu encompassing so many types of food.  They could cut the menu in half and I still think it would be more than adequate.  She had the Steak Diane, I had the Cajun Jambalaya.  The former was delicious, the latter was too dry.  The portion sizes of both were very generous.  If you finish your entree here and don't suffer from food coma immediately after I would be impressed.     So the food was OK overall, I just wish that they pare down the menu and the quantity size (just a bit) and focus their energy on delivering dishes that taste better.  Also, the cheesecake is delicious but $7 dollars per slice?  Maybe they sprinkle crack on it? The service was good though.  No complaints here about that.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1520
Mabel L.,"San Jose, United States",131,102,23,4.0,26/6/2008,"I'll admit it. I love going to The Cheesecake Factory. Yes, there are many more non-franchise, mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall, unique eateries in San Jose, but sometimes you just want huge portions of yummy American fare in a fun environment. I love that they have a million things on their menu and everything I've tried has come out pretty tasty. The servers are usually attentive and fun, and I forgive them for slow service when it's packed in there, which is most nights. I enjoy sitting in the huge booths and getting endless warm bread and butter. Overall, whenever I come with my friends I have a great time and am usually stuffed because their servings are so huge. This restaurant is definitely a staple that I enjoy coming to once in awhile. I would just recommend against going on weekend evenings because it's usually packed. I like going on random weekdays or late at night so I can get seated and served quickly.  My favorites: Bistro Shrimp Pasta Kobe Burger Crispy Chicken Costoletta Chicken Madeira Tomato Mozzarella Salad Yes, their portions are big.

Chris C.,"Union City, United States",51,549,15,3.0,29/5/2007,"The GF and I decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory because we had a $50 Gift Certificate.  Cheesecake Factory is a mid-upper mid level restruarant chain that caters to 3 main items:  1)  About 30+ different selection of Cheesecake, 2) A pretty wide menu and big menu ranging from American, Chinese, & Southwest 3)  Humgo Portion sizes. We got here about 5:30ish which was just in time to beat the dinner time rush.  Cheesecake Factor has this upscale venician feel to it.  Very open, very pleasant, but with all the open space it can get very loud.  We waited about 5-10 minutes before we were seated.  We were seated at a nice table and the waiter had the menus to us right away.  CF has a pretty big menu selection.  Most of their food options range either in the American, Asian, or Southwest realm.  They have a big selection of salads, sandwiches, and pasta with several vegetarian options.  They also have a pretty big mixed drink selection if you want to get your drink on.  Most appetizers here range in the $5-$8 range and most meals you can get under $17. The GF and I decided on the small house salad, the Corn Tamale Cakes, I got the Cuban Sandwich and she got the Grilled Cheese.  We also ordered drinks and I got the Raspberry Lemonade.  The Raspberry Lemonade was pretty good, it also helps that I have a sweet tooth, so I didn't mind it being on the sweet side.  We got the Corn Tamale Cakes and small house salad, and we forgot the number item at Cheesecake Factory, everything is served in SUPER HUGE SIZE.  The small house salad would put most restaurants regular salads to shame.  It was huge.  And the Corn Tamale Cakes, 3 big corn cakes stacked with salsa, sour cream, and slices of avacados.  After eating about half, we were both stuffed.  Then came the sandwiches, both were HUGE.  About triple the size of most places.  Both my Cuban and Grilled Cheese were pretty good.  The fries... they were very forgetful.  We both barely got through a quarter of our sandwiches and about half of our fries.  There was just TOO MUCH FOOD! We save enough room for the Apple Crisp (though they have 30+ selections of cheesecake, the GF isn't much of cheesecake fan).  There was more than enough for the two.  We probably only ate about a third of it.  We ended up taking home 2 bags worth of food which ended up being lunch and dinner the next day.  Not too bad that we got almost 3 meals for about $55 including tip. After eating here, I've come to realize, places like the Cheesecake Factory is why Americans are fat.  We were one of the few people there who didn't finish their plate full of food, which was AMAZING.  But overall, I enjoyed coming here.  I thought the food was good and the ambiance was pleasant, and the server well trained.  I know people who like to knock a place because it's a ""chain"", but if you like the food, the service was good, and the ambiance pleasing, why knock it for being a chain.  Solid 3.5 Resturant!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1520
M M.,"San Jose, United States",2,49,,4.0,12/5/2009,"Went yesterday for lunch and decided on getting 2 appz from the lunch menu, wild mushroom pizzette & the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates - also sat at the bar! Dates - 5 of 5 - AWESOME!!! the dates were stuffed with parmesean cheese, a little too much, perhaps a nuttier cheese would have raised it another level, but it was very tasty - they used a whole strip of bacon where half of one would have worked, i love them for that!  It was crispy and had some pieces of fat, which i also like, and it smelled soooo good too.  They roast them, btw. Wild Mushroom Pizzette - 3 of 5 - bigger than i thought it was going to be, but small enough to where i was not full afterwards.  Crust was nice and crispy and tasted fresh, it was topped with mushrooms, garlic, herbs & cheese - no sauce - which was pleasant - i dont know if its because i ate the dates first but it wasnt as hot as i would have liked - mushrooms were not over-cooked like on most pizza's but it didnt have that right temperature i enjoy when eating pizza - herbs and cheese were fine. Service - 5 of 5 - James is good peoples.  He had this weird customer like 3 seats to my left, and dude was asking lot's of lame questions and was quite demanding and somehow James kept a good spirit and delivered the same awesome service when most would have been annoyed, commend him for that - what made me truly know that this customer was weird was when he started talking about his Houston Rockets and how when they win the title Tracy McGrady was going to be named MVP - to this i laughed, but alas, it was not a joke, he was dead serious, i politely turned and finished my food and left.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1520

First of all, it took FOREVER to get seated.  I saw hella people that came in after us get seated way before us, and when I asked the hostess if maybe our pager was not working (they were starting to yell for parties to be seated), she rudely said, ""No!  Your pager is FINE!  You've only been waiting for 12 minutes!""...and then she turned around and proceeded to chat with a fellow hostess.  She's lucky I didn't get her name or else it'd be in this review.  All in all, we waited for about 35 minutes to be seated. The guy who actually sat us was very nice.  Didn't get his name though either. After we were seated, it took FOREVER for our server...Tim...to come by and introduce himself and take our drink orders.  When he did, we ordered two of their famous mojitos and waited for about 25 minutes for them.  Yes, 25 minutes FOR DRINKS!  When he did bring them, he just dropped them off and took off to go flirt with a table of 3 girls that were sitting behind us.  What was really bad was that there were 2 male servers AND the male manager at this table...all flirting with these fat, ugly chicks while they were neglecting their duties elsewhere.  After about 15 minutes of that crap, our server saw that we had put our menus down and finally came over to take our appetizer order.  Good thing THAT didn't take forever.  Maybe 'cuz it was the tuna carpaccio?  By this time, I still hadn't taken a drink of my mojito that I waited forever for.  My boyfriend had a sip of his and nearly gagged.  He asked me to try mine and see if it was ok.  Just then, a server was delivering food to the table next to us and she saw the look on my face and stopped to ask if everything was ok.  Our mojitos were PURE SYRUP!  No limes, no alcohol, just SYRUP!  Tim, our server, came by and took the drinks back and I got a Georgia Peach and my boyfriend got a Corona instead.  I HATE having to send drinks or food back because I always feel rude for doing so, but after we sent those mojitos back, our server didn't come by hardly at all after that.  It was almost as if he was avoiding us!  Finally, we ordered our food and then waited 45 MINUTES for it!  Our food was wonderful, but the service was terrible.  As I mentioned before, our server was avoiding us, and when my boyfriend finally flagged him down to order another Corona, he took his sweet time flirting with all the waitresses along the way.  We had to ask another server who was passing by to get the 2nd beer. After we were done eating, I had to flag our server down to get a to-go box.  He offered to box up my food for me, but I told him I'd rather do it myself and save the time (and spit)!  He asked if we would like any dessert and I asked him, ""Well, how long is THAT going to take?""  He said, ""Why, do you have to be somewhere at a certain time?  Do you have a movie to catch?""  I sharply said no and that I would just like the check.  He was completely oblivious to his crimes!  He had NO IDEA that he was LAGGING like that! I'm sure he got the hint with a $2.14 tip on a $60 tab.  Yes, I feel horrible for tipping so little, but the guy didn't even earn that $2.14.  I wanted to stiff him completely, but my boyfriend talked me out of it.  I understand that the lagging may not have been ENTIRELY Tim's fault, but still.  Don't flirt with chicks, don't piss off the bartender so your drinks are slow to come, don't piss off the kitchen so your food is slow to come, and don't avoid your customers when you're the one that delivered a horrible product.  Better yet, Tim, just quit the restaurant job.  Obviously you're only in it for the chicks.  The fat, ugly chicks. I will NEVER go back to this CF EVER again.  From now on, my money can go to the Oakridge CF...where I've always had service and food/drinks that was above and beyond.

Daron M.,"Cupertino, United States",4,77,,2.0,28/3/2009,"For the price, this place sucks. The cheesecake is delicious, but I believe they are serving smaller slices. I remember a HUGE cheesecake, not it's tiny, and still the same price. Damn recession. I was not pleased. The burger was good but still, only as good as a Jack in the box burger which is 5 dollars less. The cheesesticks are about enough to put in your mouth in a handfull. Literally. They give you 5 cheesestick patty things, that are about as small as two pennies, and charge me 5 bucks?!!? The waiter barely spoke english and kept bothering us. This is why restaraunts dont get a lot of my money. Service and quality. Both are lost in chains. Look at the ratings for ""mom and pop"" restaraunts. Much better.Not worth the wait or the money., But of course, its all about brand name so you yuppies will still go here. I really don't feel sorry for any of you who lost your 600,00 dollar homes.

But there is something else which made me mad. Although our friend did not want the birthday cheer from staff we went ahead and told the receptionist that we were there to celebrate his birthday because we thought it would be fun for 2 kids in our group. Even after reminding servers two times no body did anything. Not that we were dying for their stupid cheer but it was frustrating to see them ignore us.

Charmayne O.,"Fremont, United States",108,110,,4.0,20/1/2008,"Be ready for their notebook of a menu, it's huge! But also be ready for that 1-2 hour wait during dinner hours. This is one of my favorite places to eat when you don't mind waiting to be seated. You get most-of-the-time fresh bread when you're seated, sourdough and thier rye/wheat kind that people rave about along with butter. Some of the things I suggest: the appetizer fried mac-n-cheese ( 3 large balls of mac-n-cheese breaded and fried served with someone kind of marinara cream sauce), the chicken and biscuits (served with a hearty serving of mashed potatoes), grilled cheese sandwich (if you're feeling simple, served with large portion of fries), cajun chicken littles(huge portion, gotta eat with a sauce, some may think it's a bit bland), chicken madeira, and I also hear the burgers are great. Thier salads are like mountains, it could easily serve 3 side salads. Thier breakfast of eggs, thick bacon, and hashbrowns is awesome- not greasy like diners. If you're going to order dessert I highly suggest one thing, and it aint' even cheesecake. It's the fresh strawberry shortcake. Holy crap my mouth is salivating. The shortcake, somehow, it's almost crispy, the ice cream is delicious and the strawberry syrup and strawberries are just right. It's huge, and if you've got a sweet tooth you could eat it just as your meal-that's how filling it is. You're going to have leftovers, I promise you. Thank God I have lunch plans to go here with a friend until Wednesday or else I would be dragging that chain with me to San Jose as I speak.

Also, our waiter disappeared for 15 minutes when we wanted to call him down for the check. My Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms was surprisingly unspectacular.  I had a huge plate of bow-tie pasta left over and I'm the type that usually finishes my food.

Ronny T.,"Modesto, United States",54,7,,2.0,5/4/2011,"The 2 star rating is reflected on the service at this certain location since this is a food chain.  Other than that OVERALL the food chain itself would've gotten more than 5 stars. I've had some bad experiences as far as service at restaurants, but by far this one was the worse.  My co-workers had taken me here as a going away get together for drinks and appetizers, our waitress was a complete...well you know. She never once asked us how our drinks or appetizers were.  Every time she came to our table she always glared at us as if we were a waste of her time.  And by the end of the night, she didn't ask us if we even wanted dessert, she just came over to hand us the check (which is the most ANNOYING thing ever at ANY restaurant). Other than that, I will break it down on whats good and what I usually order. -Their bread is served free and fresh (most of the time lol) whenever you are dining in.  My fav. is their multi-grain, it's got a hint of sweetness to it which goes well with butter (and I LOVE butter). -Viet. Shrimp Summer Rolls, now I rarely order appz. at TCF mainly because their entrees are pretty big servings (which is rare to find in an upscale restaurant).  I was not a fan of these ""summer rolls"" because A. I've had better and B. To me the asparagus in this just doesn't belong in there,  It's just kinda there... - Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp:  if you want the other tables starring at this when it arrives, then definitely order it.  I love presentation, and I love curry!  Basically it's an island of rice topped off with peanuts and shredded carrots surrounded by an ocean of creamy chicken and shrimp curry.  I hate peanuts so I usually order this without the nuts and tell them to cut down on the carrots (they do like to go overboard with it).  To me this dish isn't spicy at all (but we all have diff. taste buds) if anything its mild.  It's one of my FAVORITE dishes here.  And for those of you who are afraid to try curry, this is prob. a good starter dish to get you into it, it's not that in your face curry smell. -Teriyaki Chicken:  I remember going here with a friend and he had ordered this and I had ordered my Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and I remembered him saying it was pretty good so one day I decided to give up my regular for this and oh my what a treat!  The chicken is served on a bed of white rice with a slice of grilled plantain and pineapple.  The chicken is cooked to perfection leaving it a little bit charred (it gives it a smokey taste), the sauce isn't overpowering but the sweetness of the sauce makes it go really well with the rice.  For the grilled plantain and pineapple I say screw the pineapple and give us more plantains.  If they haven't done it already (which I don't think they have) they need to make a plantain dessert after this (maybe even a cheesecake mmm) I'm not sure if they added sugar to this but it has a little hint of sweetness to it, it definitely brings the dish together somehow! -Desserts(my fav. part about this place)       -30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: this is over the top, I wanted this for my birthday and got it but man I did not know what I was getting into until I took a bite out of this.  It's really good if you like rich desserts.  Obviously cheesecake is already rich itself, but when its layered with choco. fudge cake oh man you're in trouble (I hope no one is on a diet that goes to TCF lol).  I usually have a separate stomach for desserts, but I had to throw the white flag up and save this for when I had an empty stomach.          -Godiva chocolate cheesecake:  This is the first slice of cheesecake I've had from here and if you love chocolate you'll LOVE this one.  It's rich and chocolatey, made with flourless godiva choco. cake, godiva choco. cheesecake, and choco. mousse topped off with 2 pipings of whip cream (it's their signature to cheesecakes) and garnished with a the signature choco. square from godiva. It could use more whip cream though.     -Kahlua coffee cheesecake:  At first I thought this was an odd mixture, but I love coffee and I didn't want to stray from my regular.  If you are a coffee lover you will love this, to me it's not AS rich as the other cheesecakes I've had.  It's made with a brownie bottom, then layered with kahlua cheesecake, choco. mousse and choco. ganache. -Classic Mojito (specialty drink):  I've had better mojitos, this one is way too sweet for my taste (maybe way too sweet for a mojito in general), and I love sweets usually.  I'm not sure but I think they dumped a whole bunch of sugar in here or something =\ -Strawberry creamsicle (specialty drink):  This is almost like drinking a strawberry milkshake, it's SOO delicious you'll want to order more.  One of my favs :)  Overall, this is a great food chain as far as taste, ambience and portion size.  Did I mention they have beautifully painted walls and decor? Definitely worth it for the price you pay.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1220

What I ordered: Miso salmon: bland and ok. I had this a few times and it did not taste good  Kale salad: it came out very warm. They put the salad on the bottom on the bag and so my salad was cooking. Gross. If I wanted a warm meal, I would have ordered something hot, but I ordered a salad and it was so warm. This was my mom's dinner. Horrible!  Eggplant Parmesan: pasta was so dry. It was all stuck to eat other. I was able to pick up the clump of pasta with a small fork. It was so hard.

I came to have a very relaxing time here with a coworker of mine. We were seated relatively quickly since we got there before the dinner rush.  Once we were seated the waitress came to our table and took our drinks order. We also requested bread at that time. It took like 20 minutes to get bread. We actually got our appetizers before we got the bread. After a while we got our order in. We got our food and started to eat. Here is where things start going south. The waitress came to our table, I kid you not, about 10 times asking if we were ready for boxes. She actually reached to take my coworker plate and silverware before she was even done eating. We were also ordering a to go order but we told her that we were going to order it right before we left because we didn't want it to be cold and we were going to be there a while. We hadn't even gotten our dessert yet when she comes out with our to go order. She literally said ""I took it upon myself to place your to go order because I thought the kitchen was going to take longer"". We specifically told her we had no rush in leaving as we were trying to enjoy our cocktails and dessert after work.  After we received our to go order, it clicked for us that she was going to be off which is why she was rushing us. We remembered her telling us when she took our drink order that it was ""home stretch"" meaning she was close to being done with her shift. I understand everyone wants their tips but if you are rushing me I'm not even going to give a tip. Honestly, if you have to clock out, give your damn table to another server so my service won't suck.

The nice young man a the front desk said it would be 20-25 minutes, said we could try the bar. The bar was full but got a table within ten minutes. We waited at the table another ten minutes before it got cleared. Jamie T. Was our server (young Asian influenced lady). She took our Oder within another five minutes. We then got buzzed five minutes after that for a table but told the hostess me would just stay as we had already ordered food. We ordered crab bites, Asian lettuce cups and the Thai lettuce wraps. Plus my fiancé ordered a black tea. Our server brought the crab bite, which were smaller than in past visits to dine here. But taste was spot on. The Asian wraps were next, larger with overall ingredients than in previous visits but the amount of chicken (main protein here) was very lacking. My fiancée Thai lettuce cups came and again of the small side with the amount of chicken compared to what we normally would get. Our server however seemed to be more inclined to talk with her friends than to pay any attention to us. I went the entire meal without being able to get a refill on my water and she never brought us my fiancée tea. Which was a big surprise when we got the bill and it was still in there. We asked that she remove the cost of the tea because we didn't receive it. She just shrugged her shoulders as if to say O Well. Did not even bother to apologize or show any kind of concern.

Katrina C.,"San Jose, CA",242,282,293,3.0,3/18/2017,"What happened, Cheesecake Factory?? You used to be a 4 back in the day, but you're now just a solid 3.  My boyfriend and I came to the Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday afternoon around 4:30pm. First thing I noticed when I sat down was that my knife had some crap on it. Ick.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, so we were able to get seated right away. But for not being so busy, we waited a long time for service in general. It took a while for our server to introduce herself and get our drinks. It then took 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out, which is not Jon Taffer approved! Our waitress was nice and friendly though.  The food at the Cheesecake Factory tasted good but was far off what I expected. We ordered, for instance, the Nashville hot chicken nuggets. They were definitely no Hattie B's hot chicken from Nashville. I didn't think they tasted anything like Nashville hot chicken at all actually. Nashville hot chicken is also drenched in the sauce. Cheesecake Factory has the sauce only on one side of the nuggets. For what they were, however, the nuggets were yummy. The Shepherd's pie, which was my entree, was good but didn't exactly taste like a shepherd's pie to me. It was so saucy, and the beef sauce was very thick. I did like my boyfriend's jambalaya, but the cajun flavor doesn't pack in boldness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=40
Liz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",431,506,2328,3.0,2/5/2017,"I know Cheesecake Factory always gets mediocre reviews but for some reason I keep coming back. It's not like the food is phenomenal, but it's oddly comforting. I came to this specific location for my birthday with my significant other. It was a Friday night and crazy busy as you would expect. They told us it would be about 25 minutes for a booth to open up. We waited like the rest of the crowd. Once our buzzer started ringing, we were seated. If you didn't already know, Cheesecake Factory has a huge, huge menu. Furthermore, their portion sizing here is no joke. Appetizers are the size of full entrees and entrees could probably  feed two mouths. Since it was my birthday, we decide to do a bit of splurging. We wanted the tuna carpaccio but they were unfortunately out of tuna for the night. We decided to go with the buffalo blasts and the calamari to start.  The buffalo blasts are really interesting. I have never had anything like it and it's pretty hard to describe. They are deep fried to the point where they almost taste like fried chicken on the outside. They are inside what seems like a wonton wrapper and the inside is a buffalo chicken, cheese mix. It's soft and squishy on the inside but extra crunchy on the outside. It comes with blue cheese dip but my s/o and I thought ranch would be better so we kindly asked our server for some.  The calamari is pretty standard. I think there is so much breading on the calamari that you can barely taste the seafood. Thankfully, the outside is pretty crunchy. Some places don't know how to make calamari crunchy on the outside so it ends up being squishy.  We wanted to take leftovers home so ended up ordering two entree sized pastas (way too much food). I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta while my s/o chose the jambalaya cajun pasta. I actually really like the Louisiana chicken pasta. The bow tie pasta is smothered in creamy sauce and the chicken is breaded thinly. It was my first time trying the jambalaya cajun pasta and it was underwhelming. I actually think it had barely any flavor at all. The sauce was pretty tasteless unless your bite had a bit of the sausage, shrimp and veggies. I personally just didn't really like this one. It didn't even gain any more flavor after sitting in the fridge overnight (which you would think would allow the flavors to sit some more). I ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake to-go because there was no way we would be able to fill our stomach anymore. This cheesecake is a mix of fudge cake and original cheesecake in one piece. It was the perfect thing for me because I wanted cake for my birthday, but also was craving cheesecake. It's super rich and indulgent of course, but that's my kind of treat! The server came over with a couple other servers and sang me Happy Birthday and had other tables join in. I never told my server how old I was turning, but he thought I was turning 21. I guess this birthday I lost years in my age! None the less, I appreciated that they came and sang for me and gave a complimentary mousse type thing with a candle even though it was so, so busy. Because it was so busy, service was a bit slow but we were still checked up on here and there and had our needs met.  Overall - not bad. I still enjoy coming here with my s/o to indulge and of course, get dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=40
Jenny O.,"San Jose, CA",250,211,975,3.0,3/7/2017,"Haven't been to this place in a while but since I had a gift card and a free slice of cheesecake, I decided to drop by. I love the cheesecakes here and I am always satisfied with whatever slice I decide to go with.  The lunch specials are not bad for the price ($13-$16) for a large plate of food, but the regular menu items are pretty expensive for what it is. I finally tried the much so raved about miso salmon and everyone's right - it IS delicious! The salmon wasn't overcooked and the hoisin-like sauce was delicious. I made sure to soak up every last drop with my jasmine rice. But for a $20+ dish I expect more than 5 snap peas please! And of course, I gotta have my brown bread. That sh*t is crack and I can eat loaves at a time!! I asked for some on the way out and the waiter said they were out of the brown bread. I know I was being shady for trying to take some to go, but how dare they lie to me especially since another waiter just brought some out to the table next to us. Guess the shader (me) got shaded, lol. Gripe: There's literally nowhere to park right now and it's $4 valet parking with validation - $25 without (ridiculous). And of course, there is ALWAYS a wait.

Dang L.,"San Jose, CA",8,132,183,2.0,3/12/2017,"We came here on a Friday night. Paid for the valet parking lot because there wasn't anywhere to park. When we got in at 730pm, there was a 40-50 minute wait. I had predicted this would happen, but the hubby had insisted. These two issues wouldn't have bothered me so much as the rest of my experience all cumulated.  We got seated and it took 15 minutes for our waiter to come by. We ordered. He was supposed to come back with drinks. Got the bread. 10 minutes, water and appetizer. Still waiting for the drinks. Waiter said he was going to bring it over. 5minutes later he brought one drink and said he was going to come back with the other drinks. Waited another 15 minutes. Got the food. Still. I drink. Half way through the meal he checked on us. We asked for the drink and they finally bought it. I realize it's busy but still. Now after venting: Mac and cheese ball - 4 stars. Probably the best dish of the night. Although is quite salty, the creamy tomato dish takes it to another level.  Sirloin with mash potatoes and veggies- 2.5. The hubby ordered well done. It came between medium and rare. But too hungry so he ate it anyways but left about 1/3. Because it was too rare for him. Mash potato- standard although on the saltier side.  Clam chowder - 3 stars. Good but nothing outstanding to rave about.  Steak tacos- comes with 3 tacos, beans & rice. Topped with chopped onions, salsa, guacamole and cilantro. Pretty decent but I didn't like the fact that it tasted sweet with a lingering after taste. Will not order again. - should be mostly savory for a taco.  Greek salad- 1 star. Mostly leafy greens with 2 olives and a couple if tomato and cucumber slices. It literally had no taste except the saltiness  of the feta. Had to ask for a dressing - balsamic. Then it was better. I was told they did toss it in a dressing.  Over all the low stars for the service and disappointed food prep. Maybe going on busy hour may not be a good idea.

Once seated the waiters are always kind and friendly. I've yet to have a rude waiter here. In my opinion the food is delicious and very well presented. Pricing is a bit up there but portion wise you do get what you pay for. Their cocktails are packed with flavor and not overly strong. For me this is a good thing. Cheesecake! Hello!

Jana E.,"Hayward, CA",46,24,37,1.0,12/29/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory quite a few times. But today is a different story. I'm writing this review because of the horrible horrible service that my family and I received today. Our server was SLOANE.. she needs a bit more training on how to serve her customers. I don't want to put her on blast like that but it's seriously needs to be done. Because the service we received was so bad that I am absolutely upset.  First of all, she NEVER checked up on us. Second, she forgot to give us whatever it was that we asked for. For example I asked for a new plate because it was dirty and had crumbs all over it. She NEVER came back with a plate.. and by the time I reminded her, our appetizers were finish. Well, what's the point. Ok so she MIGHT have been busy. But not really because there was empty tables. Well we gave her the benefit of the doubt. Ok well then when we asked for straws for the whole table, she completely forgot... AGAIN! I tell you, I'm not sure what it was but either she didn't like us? I'm not sure what the case was. Third, everyone in our section who sat AFTER us got their food BEFORE US. We ordered a turkey BLT, fish tacos and a miso salmon. I don't think it's that much. And a big party was eating way before us. And she was their server as well. It took about 35-40 minutes from when we ordered (we ordered right when we sat down because we were looking at the menu while waiting to be seated) to get our food. And in those 35-40 minutes she forgot about giving us our plate and straws and never checked up on us. The only thing she did for us right away was giving us our check when we asked for it. It was in less than 1 minute she came back with our check. Figures...  -- btw I'm not trying to say cheesecake servers are horrible because we seen the wonderful service other tables were getting. Just not us for some odd reason.  Anyway Sloane or management if you're reading this it's quite upsetting to see how this is such a great restaurant but it seems that some staff possibly favors other tables more. (PS; I've come to this locations plenty of times and never ever had a problem with our servers. But this is concerning and I do plan on contacting management and headquarters.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=40

Then I also got a jar of dressing which is normal for me to have salad the next 2 days. Welp looks like this is nothing like I get. It's so thin it's not even sticking to the lettuce.

The food itself took around 30 minutes or more. The waiter David was friendly. He gave us automatic refills. He also conveniently offered the cheesecake menu to us after our meal.

I'm not sure about the morning, but if you stay late enough when the mall closes, there's a free 'shuttle' (hired by Cheesecake Factory) to deliver guests to wherever they parked--asked valet how to get to my parking spot (other side of closed mall) and they told me about the shuttle which delivered me RIGHT to my car on the 2nd floor!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=40

I always try their salads and was so happy to see new kale salads on the menu. We split the nachos appetizer amongst the three of us which was so large that did not leave too much space for the entree. Small kale salad was plenty for entree and the server was great not to push a full size salad. We also had the chicken Cesar and bang bang chicken in our party and they were both very tasty. Bang bang chicken was not the traditional flavor that we are used to but was still good.  We always walk out with to go bag from Cheesecake Factory due to their large portions.

Stephen C.,"Campbell, CA",343,264,1063,1.0,12/11/2016,"Did not have a good dining experience at Cheesecake. This dinner took place December 10th, beginning at 6:45pm. We had a party of 5 people. It was a 45 min wait. It was fine. We understood. Saturday night. it was poppin. When we got to the front desk... we missed our window to grab the table by 5 mins. They put us back into the queue. Told us we had to wait another 20mins. After a while we  go up to the counter to check if we were up next. They said they already called our name when we were literally standing in front of the host/hostess desk. We continue to wait 10+ mins before we get seated.  Putting aside the long wait..it was time to order. I ordered the Crispy Shrimp Sandwich. After a long ass time... the food begins to come out. They hand me a crispy chicken sandwich...and i say nope. i didnt order this. As any consumer, you just immediately realize that if this is the sandwich that made for you... they are going to have to start from scratch and make it again. It's going to take forever. But again... things happen... so as the others eat... I wait for my sandwich to come. What's odd is that I understood why i had not gotten my food. But my friend who ordered a Cuban sandwich ALSO hadn't gotten his food neither. With no explanation to WHY he hadn't gotten his food.. we were both left waiting. My food finally comes out after another 20 mins. It's now 8:30. My crispy shrimp sandwich arrives. But WHERE WAS THE CUBAN SANDWICH?! But the best part about it was, WITHOUT any explanation, his sweet potato fries came out without the Cuban sandwich. I guess it was still lagging behind LOL. It was 8:40pm when the sandwich finally decided to come out. 3 other people at the table had finished their meals when we took our first bite.  I was waiting to the end of the meal before I started to rating this meal to see if the waiter or the manager or anyone working at cheesecake was going to do anything for our inconvenience. I understand mistake happens. I understand when it gets busy... people get flustered and even drop the ball from time to time. And that is perfectly okay. It is ALWAYS about how you treat the customer and making a bad situation into a better one. But NOPE... NOPE...NOPE...NOPE.  Our waitress said sorry probably like 10 times but that does nothing for our meal. It wasn't completely her fault. It was the entire crew at Cheesecake. I am a huge fan of this place. It is just disappointing that I was looking forward to eating here and this is what we get....  Overall stats: waited over an hour before getting seated. took over an hour to get everyone's food. People already finished eating before the last person got their dish. Where was the manager? Would have been nice if he/she came over to make sure all the customers are satisfied but hey... ""Cheesecake was probably busy"" ""there were probably another issue he/she had to take care of."" Either way... we were left in the dark. Nothing was compensated. For that night, Cheesecake Factory offered a horrible dining experience. Will not return any time soon.  Thanks for reading my rant.

We have ordered from The Cheesecake Factory far more times than we ever should have and EVERY time it's extremely late and a food item is either missing, incorrect or not there. It's a joke! We only order for 10 people and they consistently disappoint us. If we call and ask what happened, we are treated like garbage and if we complain it's as if we criticized their first born.

It is not helpful in a customer service environment when the serving staff projects their frustrations and feeling of being overwhelmed onto the guest of that establishment.  I'll chalk that up to a lack of training and lack of employees.  Needless to say, where they lack in people skills they make up with my salmon. The menu is overwhelming and can confuse a straving person with the various choices.

I forgot who, but a friend or acquaintance recommended it to me year and years ago and I've been getting it ever since. It's got a nice hint of spice and the chicken that it comes with is lightly breaded, so your taste buds do not get clogged with all of that flavor stealing breading thievery.  Before that I would get the Chicken Littles which come with mashed potatoes and corn and I remember that being lovely as well.  I'm always way too full for cheesecake because the dishes are the size of 49 Volkswagen Beetles, but I have had a few of them in my lifetime and they were DELICIOUS.  Oh and that FREE BROWN BREAD they serve you while you wait for your meal is extremely tasty.

Multibillion corporation, you'd think they'd give they're chefs some cooking lessons. Uncooked pasta can make one very sick. Food and service was horrible. Took us nearly an hour just to get the check and another hour just so she can pick up the check. It died down around 8:30 and we were still receiving bad service. Hope you guys retrain the servers.

Julius W.,"Oakland, CA",46,4,3,1.0,3/25/2017,"I'll start by saying, I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory, but today's experience was UNACCEPTABLE and borderline insulting! My wife and I were heading home to the East Bay, but decided to stop at this location to grab dinner on our way home. We walked in and were IMMEDIATELY seated in the back right next to the restrooms, even though we walked past an ENTIRE open section in the front where NO ONE was seated. (We continued to watch as customers of color continued to be led to the back of the restaurant.) Why is that? After ordering apps, it took over 20 minutes for my app to arrive. (My app was an order of spring rolls). Why did it take 20 minutes for it to come out? Then, it took a while longer before our food came out. Our waitress kept telling us, ""It's on the way"", but I assume it was just words as nothing came out. Once our food finally arrived, my food was good, but my wife's order was WRONG! She ordered grilled fish tacos, but fried fish tacos came out instead. Again, the waitress told us, ""We'll fix it right away and bring it out to you."" 20 minutes passed by and NO TACOS. My wife went to get the manager and we explained to him what happened. He gave a half apology, but offered nothing for our inconvenience and lack of quality service. I used to work in a restaurant and when I messed up, I offered a comp. bill, dessert, a sincere apology, and I made sure to follow up with the customer. Guess what??! Those customers always came back and I treated them like VIP customers when they came in. The manager here seemed to not really care about our dinner experience. If that's the case, let me know and I'll get up and walk out. The staff today did not meet our expectations in any way and because of that, we will NEVER eat at this location again. To me, it seems like customers of color aren't valued. I hope I'm wrong, but as I tell my kindergarten students, ""Your actions always speak louder than words."" Before driving back home, my wife and I stopped by Pleasant Hill and grabbed her an EXCELLENT burger from Moana's. Thanks to them, she had an enjoyable meal! If you're thinking about eating at this location, please read the reviews first. If I did, it would have saved us a lot of trouble!

Jan E.,"San Jose, CA",181,271,980,4.0,9/11/2013,"This is a great place to take someone on a date because it's fancy and the menu has a million things to choose from. We usually get 3 appetizers to share and each get our own main dish. We even get a cheesecake to wash everything down. I like the strawberry lemonade and that has unlimited refills. We've never had a problem with the service. They are pretty good about bringing your food out and refilling your water. There's so much to choose on the menu. We like trying new things. Everything is pretty good. There's room for improvement for some of the food though. For example, I ordered the spring summer rolls and the wrap was all broken. They did not know how to wrap a Vietnamese spring roll lol. The crab cheese wonton is also good. The lobster and artichoke dip is good. Ahhhh my mouth is watering as I'm listing some of their yummy food. My hubby liked the pork chop but to me it was kinda dry but that's just me. I liked the hibachi steak but he did not like it. I remember not liking the club sandwich either. Overall everything is pretty good. They also give you bread and butter while you wait for your food so that's cool if you are hella hungry. Our bill is usually $100 because we don't eat here often and like to go all out. I still say its a good date place but if you're cheap then go eat at the food court lol. One con is that our snicker cheesecake was old one time. You can taste the old ness. $7.50 for an old slice of cheesecake is a no no. You would expect fresh cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory right?? But nope they gave us an old one that was at least a few days old.

Thank M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,33,,5.0,8/22/2016,Visited recently to eat dinner with a large team. I have only good words to say about this place except for the large wait.

Alex K.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,8,4,1.0,8/9/2017,"If I could give this place 0 starts I would. The only good thing out of dining here was the bread. To start off the restaurant wasn't super busy but had a 15-20 minute wait which wasn't horrible. The waitress my girlfriend and I had was friendly but was not attentive to anything we said. We order drinks, an appetizer, and a main course. The appetizer never came. The drinks came when our food came after waiting 40-45 minutes and after reminded her twice about the drinks. My drink was at least 75% ice and tasting flat. We then ordered one slice of cheesecake thinking it would only take a few minutes for one slice of cheesecake to travel from the front of the restaurant to our table, nope. Almost 15 minutes of waiting. And that point we were both pretty fed up and paid the bill. I will be returning to talk to the manger because the service was unbearable. I do not recommend coming here to anyone. The scenery is nice and romantic but everything else is shit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=440

I will say, it must've sucked for the other 2 girls, but hey they volunteered and I only waited 15 mins :) I got the skinnylicious chicken soft tacos and they were quite filling.

I was hungry and left wanting for more at the end of my meal. We also ordered the Calabrian pizza and it was great. I think I've had the best pizzas at Wolfgang Puck and this one came in a close second.

Was waiting for a while, but it was pretty packed, so I gave them some more time. After 15 minutes of waiting, I called and let them know that I'm about to leave.

Xin W.,"San Francisco, CA",294,111,234,4.0,4/24/2015,"So I'm always on this endless pursuit in finding the best cheesecake. There are various qualities that I look at: the texture (and how smooth it is), the softness/fluffiness of it (it should melt in your mouth), the balance of sweetness and tanginess, the levels of acidity (very important in a rich dish like the cheesecake), the crust (not too thick and not too thin) and how crunchy it is, the flavors, the presentation, and the freshness (especially when there are fruit toppings). The secret is to bake the cheesecake low and slow to prevent it from cracking, to prevent the sides from rising and the center from sinking, and to result in a light, moussey texture. However unless you're Gordon Ramsay or on Masterchef, it usually take 5+ hours to bake the perfect cheesecake. Cheesecake Factory add synthetic binders, like guar gum and xanthan gum, to their batter to allow it to be baked faster while still holding it together. While the cheesecake here is definitely not the best I've tasted, it tastes pretty good. My favorite is the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. Nice bite of acidity, good balance of sweetness and tanginess, thin crunchy crust with an airy-looking texture. All of the other cheesecake I've eaten here are either too sweet or too rich.  For the entrees, I really love the Steak Diane. Very flavorful, very tasty, and the steak is cooked to perfection, very juicy. The shrimp scampi is also great! Although I wish they would put in more shrimps. I'm not quite a fan of their pasta, it's very buttery and very rich.  Ambience is cozy, although it can get busy at times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=440

Jessica R.,"San Jose, CA",48,12,11,4.0,11/27/2016,"My girlfriend and I have been here numerous times! We always order the Chicken Costoletta, it's probably the most savory chicken dish I've ever had. However, last night we came for our 5 year anniversary and were extremely bugged by our server Marilyn. The time before last night that we were here, we left a $31 tip on a $50 tab  and last night we left a $9.30 tip on a $60 tab and I honestly didn't want to tip her. We got here at about 11:10 pm and everything was going great, we ordered quickly and she came with our drinks pretty fast. However, she could not let us enjoy our meal in peace, she popped up literally every 3 minutes asking us the same question. She interrupted our conversations all the time and 3 of those times were to push us into buying a cheesecake that we didn't even want since we don't like cheesecake. A couple of minutes later, WE WERE STILL NOT DONE EATING and she just comes and picks up our plates and asks if we want boxes. Are you freaking kidding me?! So thoughtless and rude to just pick up our food without asking if we were even done eating. At this point my girlfriend and I were so annoyed. When the server brought us our tab she circled the recommended gratuity with a heart at the bottom of the receipt, she did that on both receipts and she then stayed the whole time  that we were writing the tip on the tab. I was so pissed off at this point, this is my favorite restaurant and we honestly should've just gone to Yard House across the street, because she totally ruined our mood for the night. I don't know if she's new or not but that is not the way to go about service. I used to be a server and let me tell you this lady needs proper training, because now I would much rather go to a different cheesecake location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=420
Shannen Q.,"Milpitas, CA",172,7,,1.0,9/5/2015,"I've been here before and had decent experiences but after tonight I will not return . We put our name down at 7:20 for a party of 14 and was told the expected time is 1.75 to 2 hour wait . We had no problem because it is a Saturday night . However after 2 hours, we did not even receive a buzzer . 30 minutes later we got a buzzer and said about a 10 minute wait before we can be seated . We waited another 20 minutes until I found out that other customers would not leave the tables that we needed . No buggy, it's not their fault .  However , our tables were set and we sat ourselves because no host came to take us to our seats . Then right off the bat, our waitress comes with a small attitude trying to rush us to get our orders in . After ordering, our food took almost 30 minutes to come out, and you can not tell me that they wait for all the food to be ready because all the burgers did not come until 10 minutes after . Another issue that really irked me was when a guest of mine asked for cheese the waitress never came with any so we asked again , and we let her know that we asked and she said she would come back and she then replied with attitude, rolled her eyes, and walked away .  Lastly, my food came out dry and I requested for some extra sauce and I asked 2 different waiters for the sauce . I waited until half my party already finished their food before I called the manager to complain . Fortunately the manager was nice enough to give my food for free, take away gratuity, as well ask pack my food up with its extra sauce . Afterwards, three other waiters along with or waitresses were off staring at us and whispering.  This place has one of the most rude service I have ever experienced . I expected so much more from such a big restaurant as Cheesecake Factory.

Instead, his point was that I should appreciate they found it and kept it for me.  My card is a very thick card, and he said it was behind all my receipts. However, I did take away all the receipts for signing the bill. It's impossible that I could miss my card. What an attitude!!! I have to drive to the restaurant again for my card and all these were caused by the restaurant not me! Watch your card and make sure you get your card back after you pay your bill.

I've been to this location as well as the one at Oakridge Mall plenty of times over the last few years. When comparing my favorite dishes, this location has always done a better job.  Been trying to eat healthier, trying is the key word, so I like how Cheesecake Factory has their Skinnylicious menu. My favorite pasta dish was the Pasta DaVinci, but at 1520 calories it sadly needs to be avoided.  I can't help but laugh at the name skinnylicious, sounds like bootylicious, maybe their menu will help me get there, lol.  Anyways back to the food. I ordered their chicken and mushroom lettuce wrap and surprisingly enjoyed my meal. It's listed as an appetizer on the menu but was filling enough for me because I just asked for more lettuce.  Service is always friendly here.

My all time favorite is the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries.  If I didn't gain weight, I would eat it everyday!  They had a skinnylicious menu and we tried a couple of items on there. +skinny margarita - tastes like the original one, but not with all the calories. +crab bites - came out on a little cast iron dish with 6 pieces and some mustard/tartar sauce on the side. These were pretty good and enough to share. +skinny turkey burger - this was surprisingly good, it came with tomato, grilled onions and a side salad. Very filling, but not heavy on your stomach.  +Evelyn's pasta - husband always orders this,  it's a nice and simple pasta dish which I've learned to replicate at home, yet he still orders it lol. +original cheesecake with fresh strawberries - of course this isn't on their skinny menu, but it was so good, I couldn't resist.

Latter is the case now.This cheesecake factory location near valley Fair Mall , San Jose is unbelievable. I went on a Sunday night around 8pm and the wait was 30-50 mins which is acceptable, but even after my buzzer went on we were not seated saying 'it doesn't work that way ' ,why the hell did you give me that thing then.. well, after we were seated, for 20 mins! ,none of the servers cared to come, let alone take our orders. I really want to mention my order number which is 27 on the 19 th of March ,server was a tall well built man who couldn't understand what we were ordering and had to look at the menu which my guess should be a new recruit and who didn't care enough to bring us our water after waiting for 30 mins. Later we had to ask an Asian guy who was serving the next table for what's happened to the starter bread and water, he was like am not 'responsible for ur food n ur service okay!' and he was talking to me like am a freaking 3 year old  and man don't I know servers take up alloted tables in a hotel , can't he be at least courteous enough to say 'ok, I will look for ur server  and bring some water in the mean time'. After a gruesome wait we had to stop a man who was not our server AGAIN and ask to at least bring our drinks, he passed us 3 times after that without glancing . How can I blame him if 'my table's server' didn't even bother to show up after all our talk with the manager which was after 45 mins wait . The manager who was a lady was like u don't have to pay any bill , I didn't taste any damn thing in ur restaurant to take out my wallet.

First we were seated on the 'lighter' side of the restaurant only to be told minutes later that the host had seated us wrong and then we were put on the dim side. Ok, not horrible yet, but annoying.  Then we waited 40 minutes for our meal to come out. I ordered the Herb crusted salmon, mash, and asparagus, my hubby ordered the pork chop, mash and green beans. The salmon was TASTELESS and barely cooked. Seriously, this is fish, how long does it take to cook well? My mashed potatoes were cold. My hubby's mash had some black stuff in it that we couldn't identify but when we told the manager she confirmed that it was burnt potatoes??? OMG! The green beans had no flavor either and tasted as if they were sitting in a pot of water for hours.  The service: Once I brought the ridiculously long wait time to the attention to the manager, the waitress got irritated and appreared to not be interested in trying to serve us any further. Which is STUPID because the food wasnt directly her fault so not sure why she was acting all butt hurt.

Meadow S.,"Campbell, CA",418,19,2,1.0,4/26/2015,"Congratulations to the Cheesecake Factory for being my first bad yelp review!!! Let me just say wow do you guys deserve it :) I think it's fair to say that I will never be returning to this place after the experience I had. My friends and I all decided to come here for dinner tonight because we had a couple of coworkers leaving and wanted to have a farewell dinner and we all decided the Cheesecake factory was the place for us (we were obviously wrong). Because we all work in customer service ourselves we tried our best to be as helpful as possible by calling in advance to let them know we were coming, and having someone there to check us in so they can prepare for a very large group. You would think the respect would be reciprocated but it was apparent that they could care less about their customers when they gave our table away TWICE. Did they really think 16 girls sitting in a lobby for 45 min would be better then holding the table for 5 more min? We decided to give California Pizza Kitchen a call and they seated us immediately (take notes). Not only were they so accommodating but they also made us all feel very welcomed and went above and beyond for us. They gave us all the customer service that you would expect at a pretentious place like The Cheesecake Factory. I know that in the future when we plan large party dinners (which we do very often) we will be going to CPK now.  Moral of the story, this place could care less about their customers, if they did then they would've helped a large party with open arms instead of leaving us all frantic looking for a place to fit us in in such short notice (something we obviously tried to avoid) If you want to go somewhere great to eat go to CPK!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=820

I feel like Cheesecake Factory is definitely hyped up, especially the one in SF and this one is no different. Came here because I owed a bestie from a bet - and it's his favorite restaurant AND once again I was starving - I love wheat bread! Sat down as they dimmed the lights. Errr maybe it's because it seemed too romantic for me? And it's kinda awk with a bestie, know what I mean? Anyway. Got Salsbury Steak off the special menu, and he got Kobe Burger.  Salsbury Steak topped with thick sauce and cooked onions came with mashed potatoes and peas, yum! I've been craving mashed potatoes for the longest time! But it was kinda dry though :\ Traded off and had some of his Kobe Burger. It was good, but wasn't to die for. The fries that were included were good! But didn't want too much of that.

Their menu is extensive, espeically in pasta dishes and cheesecake of course. I had the Pomegranate Margarita - on the rocks, its tart & moderately sweet, but not enough tequila!! :( Factory Combo: Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane - I thought the shrimp scampi came with pasta, but to my surprise it didnt.. I was sad, thought I was going to have a little bit of pasta & steak.  So in the middle of my plate was a mountain of mash potato, to the left was the steak (more like 4-5 small pieces) with mushrooms tossed with some Asian soysauce dressing and to the right was 3 lightly battered jumbo shrimp sitting on some creamy white sauce with pieces of tomato.  It was decent, but I dont know if I'll order this again, considering they have so many other dishes to choose from. I really wanted to try their cheesecake, but was too full to even try.  I think the next time I come here, I won't finish up all my food, but leave room for dessert. :))",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=820

They even sang to me and brought me a special birthday ice cream sundae with my name spelled out in chocolate syrup! Our party of six got the royal treatment, with prompt service, friendly faces, accurate orders, and delicious yummy food!  I ordered the samosas and a house salad. My brother, his son, and friend got pasta dishes. My mom got the salmon, and my sweetheart got fries. For dessert we shared a Hershey's chocolate chip cheesecake and chocolate fudge cake, and of course my special birthday treat! Everyone loved their food and had leftovers to take home. Who knew getting older could be so much fun? Bring it on! The booths are big enough to open presents at the table, and enough elbow room for everyone. Several waiters including our own came to sing to me, as they did for a couple others so I clearly was in good birthday company for the evening! I love that it's nice enough here to really dress up, or not if you don't feel like it. We were dressed up. A waitress even agreed to take pictures for us! Splendid! I really have to hand it to the staff here. They work amidst a lot of noise and deal with a lot of people and really hold it together.

I have heard so many good thing about this place but never been motivated to give it a try.  I never liked cheesecake so the name of the place just seemed not to impress me one bit.  Boy was I missing out. I can't believe what I have been missing out on.  Never liked or care for cheesecake until I came to this place.  It is a fun place to dine and have wonderful and delicious cheesecakes.  They have a lot of varieties of cheesecakes.  The one that is my favorite thus far is the red velvet cheesecake.  It is to die for.   Talking about it is making my mouth watery and just want to run out and get some.  Anybody want to join me?

The decor is lovely and I've always been satisfied with the customer service. The wheat bread is here is so delicious also! I call it chocolate bread because the bread is a really dark brown. Their wheat bread is always moist, warm, and amazing! My hubby and I always start with calamari and it never disappoints. I usually get the garlic noodles with chicken. It's full of butter and a decent amount of garlic. The chicken on it is always tender too! My hubby enjoys the burgers here because they're BIG!  I've never had the cheesecake here but my friends who have really enjoy it. My mama always spoils my brother with a slice when we go together.  I like that Cheesecake factory has a large food menu and a decent cocktail menu. It's nice to have a variety. I end up always getting the same thing though! It's so hard to choose. Whenever my hubby and I wanna treat ourselves for a hard week's work, we'll go here. The one bad thing about Cheesecake factory is the long wait. We usually go for a late lunch or early dinner to avoid the rush. I don't think it's worth waiting an hour in line for 2 people to eat.

Jose G.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/11/2014,Food tastes good and dining service is good not excellent but good.  My bad experience was ordering curbside.  First of all you cannot order on line they make you call to place your order.  When I arrived and called to let them know I was waiting for my order the phone rang at least 20 times before it was picked up then was transferred to bakery.  Bakery never picked up the phone so after 12 minutes of waiting on hold after an additional 5 minutes of trying to get through i decided to go inside to get my order.   They need to take lessons from other establishments such as BJ's and Outback on how curbside ordering should be performed.  Busy workers like myself do not always have time to wait an hour to be seated to eat in the restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=820

Thundar C.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,1,2.0,6/18/2012,"I'd like to give this a higher review but two things really bug me about this restaurant: 1.  Sunday Brunch - they open at 10 AM but they are never ready at 10.  It seems like it takes them 20-25 minutes to get going.  Last Sunday we were seated at 10:07, promptly ordered and it took 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  That's a common occurrence.  Why not have the staff arrive a little earlier so they can be ready to go when they open? 2.  They almost always burn the hashbrowns.  Last Sunday I specifically asked them not to burn the hashbrowns...guess what....they burned the hashbrowns.  For some reason the cooks think if they put the burnt side down we won't notice.  I pulled the burnt chucks out and stacked them on the side of the plate and told the waiter this is an example of how they always burn the hashbrowns.  He apologized, blamed it on the cook (duh!) and asked if we wanted another side of hashbrowns as a replacement.  We were nearly done with breakfast so we politely declined. When we were waiting for the check a manager stopped by, apologized and also offered us a replacement side of hashbrowns.  We're done eating...no we don't want another side dish. At the very least they could have offered us a coupon for a freebie piece of cheesecake. This isn't the only thing they burn.  I've gotten a chicken dish in the past where the entire bottom portion was burnt.  I've cooked at restaurants and I know when I've burned something.  It seems like these guys think they can put it black side down and cover it in sauce and no one will notice it tastes like charcoal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=860

The rest of this review is more directed for families with young children (aka: babies).  My husband and I always talk about walking over to Santana Row after browsing Valley Fair for lunch. Out of the two times we've talked about it, we've never been able to make the trek over. Instead, we always stop by Cheesecake factory right before the wait gets too crazy.  Our son is only 7 months old, but he's a huge 7 month old boy! Without asking, the hostess brought us to our table with 2 adult menus and a kid's menu. We later told her that we didn't need a kid's menu. Right when we sat down, our server brought us over some slices of bananas with bread in the shape of a butterfly. Yikes, they were so nice! We can't tell them that he can't eat solid foods yet. So I mashed up the bananas and gave it to our son for a pre-lunch snack.  We never realized how important changing pads are in restaurants till we had a baby of our own. I dunno what's worse, a bathroom with a nasty changing pad or a bathroom with no changing pad at all! Anyway, Cheesecake Factory has a really nice bathroom with a clean changing pad area!  In short, this is a great chain restaurant to bring young ones.

We had to pour in a lot of tobasco and pepper into the plates to try to get that stuff down our throats. Mac n Cheese texture was nasty. It felt like I was eating Mac n Cheese inside a fuzzy furball. And the taquitos were average. But I must have to say the sour apple martini was perfection. Besides that the Tropical martini was a bit on the strong side, and the hennessy shots weren't worth the money since it wasn't filled to the rim.  The service was great. But it didn't make up for the lack of quality in their food. But by golly was their bread GOOD. I ate like 3 loaf of them. no joke. for about $16 a plate, I don't think I would come back.

(which was expected from this location), service was friendly but I wish our server recommended better dishes as he said most dishes on the menu were his ""favorite"". For some reason our Herb Salmon dish tasted sour, and the herbs tasted like seaweed. It wasn't satisfying and did not taste the same like it did before. The server also recommended the Chicken Madeira for my sister's BF but it didn't look too appetizing as well. Our server was friendly and I'm sorry to say but the service was pretty slow.

Katrina T.,"Cupertino, CA",61,959,1588,4.0,3/25/2012,"3.5 stars or 4 stars? I'm in decisive, so can't decide how many stars I should really give The Cheesecake Factory.  I used to come here lots as a kid. Loved it! Loved getting their cheesecakes because they are truly one of the best with their endless decadent choices. It's been awhile since I had come here and after my visit, the feel for this place felt different.  I didn't get the feel of originality from the restaurant anymore. I felt like it was just trying to keep up with its competitors in terms of their menu. They have a ""SkinnyLicious"" menu. What I don't understand is why the prices on this menu are the same as the regular menu. The only difference is that it is less in calories, so essentially its ""healthier"". Shouldn't the prices be less if there is less food? IDK.  Anyway got the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad. Pretty spicy. Fresh tuna. The salad wasn't the best thing ever at the same time wasn't the worst. I think I should have gotten the BBQ Chicken Salad or pasta.  Our waiter was really nice but super off. He took forevs to give us our bread. My gf ordered a BOWL of clam chowder, he though she said cup and apologized saying he would charge her for the cup instead. When the bill came out he ended up charging her for the BOWL. Uh weird. Then when he needed to talk to another party sitting next to us, he awkwardly had to kneel over our side of the table to reach over to the other side. This probably doesn't make any sense whatsoever, but whatever he did was AWKS.  Hopefully I can come here again and enjoy myself more!

The cheesecake is the same--good, but not a amazing. Likewise, they have a wide selection of cheesecake.  However, the service here is horrible.  I pre-ordered a cheesecake and I selected a pickup time that was not busy (a Tuesday around 11AM). Moreover, I ordered a very basic cheesecake (just strawberry topping). Although, I arrived on time my cheesecake was not ready.  Not only was is not ready--it took them 45minutes to prepare it. The cheesecake portion was done but the strawberry's were not put on. I was told this was done to ensure the cake tasted fresh--fair enough. However you would think that they would have the strawberries cut so that they could be put on quickly. No, sadly that was not the case. Therefore, I had to watch my server cut about 2 dozen strawberries dip them in syrup (which he had to replenish because they also ran out of this) and then put them on one by one. This took 45 minutes.  If one pre-orders a cake I expect arrangements to be made so that last minute assembly (which is understandable) be taken care of ahead of time so that customers are not waiting. Furthermore, there were no bags big enough to hold my cake box, even though I bought a standard size. Although, this is a minor detail--I think it is a 'nicety' most customers should expect.  Likewise, I've also been here for dinner. For some absurd reason they don't take reservations. I think that is completely unfair when customers can expect to wait for three hours and when your food is simply mediocre.  Moreover, the area around the mall has plenty of good places to eat--places that have better food and service.

My job is VERY customer oriented, so ALL of my coworkers know the value of making the customer feel HAPPY and WELCOME. So here's the deal. My coworkers called the cheesecake factory to make reservations for our large group. They did not take reservations... no problem! One of my coworkers was sent to the Cheesecake Factory to put her name down. She was informed that we would not be seated until 80% of the table was there. No problem, everything is still normal.  Now here is where the Cheesecake factory REALLY dropped the ball. They gave away our table not only once, but TWICE! But it gets better- they didn't even inform us about the situation. We were informed that Marsha, the manager ""did what she had to do."" Well, Marsha, I'll tell you what you have to do.... Inform your customers as to when you'll be making them wait over an hour for a table that you'll be giving away TWICE with no warning. It's really not that hard to do.

Here's the thing, I've worked in the industry and now I work in customer service so I'm not one to complain but to have that wait time and have it to be your birthday sucks. I love that they only offered us to give us a free birthday dessert for the wait which is standard at most restaurants like this one. Paying almost $100.00 for this was so horrible.

It was a great place to go where a party of six could each order something completely different from one another and enjoy it thoroughly. Perhaps I've just grown tired of the standard routine there, or perhaps this location just isn't on top of their game the same way others are. I'm not sure. But I've gone twice now and it's just been okay... and it used to be a destination restaurant for me. The service is just so-so now. Certainly nothing special. Maybe they're not training their staff as well, or perhaps the standards of service in the South Bay just don't compete. There's always a wait and there are always lots of unbussed tables when you enter. They're not efficient like they once were. They've taken a lot of excellent items off of the menu (hello Shrimp Poor Boy) and replaced them with a lot of uninspiring choices. It's still tasty. I'll still return.

We came for dessert but she still offered bread and of course we took it because the bread is bangin! Anyways we go the nachos with spicy chicken.

Ronny T.,"Modesto, CA",54,7,,2.0,4/5/2011,"The 2 star rating is reflected on the service at this certain location since this is a food chain.  Other than that OVERALL the food chain itself would've gotten more than 5 stars. I've had some bad experiences as far as service at restaurants, but by far this one was the worse.  My co-workers had taken me here as a going away get together for drinks and appetizers, our waitress was a complete...well you know. She never once asked us how our drinks or appetizers were.  Every time she came to our table she always glared at us as if we were a waste of her time.  And by the end of the night, she didn't ask us if we even wanted dessert, she just came over to hand us the check (which is the most ANNOYING thing ever at ANY restaurant). Other than that, I will break it down on whats good and what I usually order. -Their bread is served free and fresh (most of the time lol) whenever you are dining in.  My fav. is their multi-grain, it's got a hint of sweetness to it which goes well with butter (and I LOVE butter). -Viet. Shrimp Summer Rolls, now I rarely order appz. at TCF mainly because their entrees are pretty big servings (which is rare to find in an upscale restaurant).  I was not a fan of these ""summer rolls"" because A. I've had better and B. To me the asparagus in this just doesn't belong in there,  It's just kinda there... - Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp:  if you want the other tables starring at this when it arrives, then definitely order it.  I love presentation, and I love curry!  Basically it's an island of rice topped off with peanuts and shredded carrots surrounded by an ocean of creamy chicken and shrimp curry.  I hate peanuts so I usually order this without the nuts and tell them to cut down on the carrots (they do like to go overboard with it).  To me this dish isn't spicy at all (but we all have diff. taste buds) if anything its mild.  It's one of my FAVORITE dishes here.  And for those of you who are afraid to try curry, this is prob. a good starter dish to get you into it, it's not that in your face curry smell. -Teriyaki Chicken:  I remember going here with a friend and he had ordered this and I had ordered my Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and I remembered him saying it was pretty good so one day I decided to give up my regular for this and oh my what a treat!  The chicken is served on a bed of white rice with a slice of grilled plantain and pineapple.  The chicken is cooked to perfection leaving it a little bit charred (it gives it a smokey taste), the sauce isn't overpowering but the sweetness of the sauce makes it go really well with the rice.  For the grilled plantain and pineapple I say screw the pineapple and give us more plantains.  If they haven't done it already (which I don't think they have) they need to make a plantain dessert after this (maybe even a cheesecake mmm) I'm not sure if they added sugar to this but it has a little hint of sweetness to it, it definitely brings the dish together somehow! -Desserts(my fav. part about this place)       -30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: this is over the top, I wanted this for my birthday and got it but man I did not know what I was getting into until I took a bite out of this.  It's really good if you like rich desserts.  Obviously cheesecake is already rich itself, but when its layered with choco. fudge cake oh man you're in trouble (I hope no one is on a diet that goes to TCF lol).  I usually have a separate stomach for desserts, but I had to throw the white flag up and save this for when I had an empty stomach.          -Godiva chocolate cheesecake:  This is the first slice of cheesecake I've had from here and if you love chocolate you'll LOVE this one.  It's rich and chocolatey, made with flourless godiva choco. cake, godiva choco. cheesecake, and choco. mousse topped off with 2 pipings of whip cream (it's their signature to cheesecakes) and garnished with a the signature choco. square from godiva. It could use more whip cream though.     -Kahlua coffee cheesecake:  At first I thought this was an odd mixture, but I love coffee and I didn't want to stray from my regular.  If you are a coffee lover you will love this, to me it's not AS rich as the other cheesecakes I've had.  It's made with a brownie bottom, then layered with kahlua cheesecake, choco. mousse and choco. ganache. -Classic Mojito (specialty drink):  I've had better mojitos, this one is way too sweet for my taste (maybe way too sweet for a mojito in general), and I love sweets usually.  I'm not sure but I think they dumped a whole bunch of sugar in here or something =\ -Strawberry creamsicle (specialty drink):  This is almost like drinking a strawberry milkshake, it's SOO delicious you'll want to order more.  One of my favs :)  Overall, this is a great food chain as far as taste, ambience and portion size.  Did I mention they have beautifully painted walls and decor?

Last time I came here I got the Hibachi Steak that i have had before at other cheesecakes- this one was not good. Bits of the steak was hard and it made me feel so sick later on.  THe only redeeming factor was the service. She was spectacular and kept coming back to make sure we had everything we needed.

Of all the steaks I do like their Steak Diane. It's well marinated, juicy, and not over done. The portion is just right that is if you will be having appetizers and dessert. I've tried their filet mignon and was very disappointed. The steak was over done and charred, definitely not how a steak should be! My favorite appetizers are: Fried Calamari, fried mac and cheese, and fire cracker salmon rolls. Of all their choices I found those to be more pleasant. Don't bother with their crabcakes, they were salty, mushy, and wasn't done right. Last but not least, their cheesecake!!

Che H.,"Campbell, CA",3,8,,1.0,11/23/2011,"Went there the other night with my cousin and his wife who had both flown in from out of town. Dinner was alright ... nothing spectacular. But here's the kicker; we were presented with a bill and paid it. A few minutes later the server came over and profusely apologized that they had made a mistake on our bill. At one point saying that she didn't even think that it was ours. She said that she didn't want us to have to pay for something that wasn't ours. Sounds reasonable. The manager then came by and apologized too and promised to clear things right up. However we noticed that while the server and manager made it sound like they were doing us a favor, they never came out and said what the bill discrepancy was. We started getting suspicious. Sure enough when we got the bill it was $4 higher than the previous bill. Now $4 isn't much money. And it represents less than 1% of the total bill. But on the flip side $4 IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY! They probably spent more than $4 in labor going through the whole process of adjusting the bill. It came off as cheap and petty. And worse it came off as disingenuous. They played coy making it sound like they were doing us a favor but the whole time they were covering their butts over a $4 difference. Of course I lowered my tip amount so my total payment was the same as before the adjustment was made. Basically the server got penalized. Here's a tip to anyone at CF that might be reading: good customer service means that after the bill is presented to the customer you only adjust it one way ... down in the customer's favor. If the restaurant makes a mistake that costs them money then they should 1) tell the customer and 2) EAT THE COST OF THE MISTAKE! Telling the customer sets future expectations that the price won't always be this good. Eating the cost of the mistake gives the restaurant an oppurtunity to look magnanimus and instills a feeling in the customer that the establishment cares more about them then profit. Even if this isn't true, it's the customer perception that matters here. In this case CF just looks stupid (for making a $4 mistake) and petty (for making me pay for it).

First off, there's no point in giving white bread in the beginning...cause EVERYONE knows it's all about their WHEAT bread.

We were left to choose from: - The food court (no.  just...no.) - ""Sushi Boat"" (Mall sushi on a Sunday?  Get real) - California Pizza Kitchen (AKA Overpriced Pizza Kitchen) - Cheesecake Factory Not the best selection...all I can say is holy carp.  Yes, that's right.  Holy carp.  Holy carp = holy mackerel x 5 Anyway.  Good thing we were busied with programming our new cell phones because the wait at 8:00 on a Sunday night was ridiculous!  I think we spent 40 minutes sitting outside piddling time away...and if we'd been smart about it, we'd have just spent that time driving to Los Gatos or someplace offering better food.  Live and learn I suppose. As far as Cheesecake Factories go, this one was a bit sub-standard.  The wait staff, while pleasant, were operating at 250% capacity and it showed.  It took 10 minutes for someone to come over and offer us bread and water, and a waitress dropped a -whole tray- of dishes right behind me shortly thereafter.  Mid way through our meal, our servers switched and we had a new girl who came by to try and take our food away and offer us dessert while we were still eating.  Oy.  This is where basic powers of observation come into play. The food was prepared adequately, but was nothing I would write home about. I don't care how big the platter is; if I'm dropping $14+ on some fish tacos, they'd better be out-frickin-standing (they weren't), because I know I can walk up the street to taqueria vallarta and get them for a third of the price and triple the flavor.   I choked down my overpriced bland tacos and of course had to waddle out because as most people know, Cheesecake Factory don't do ""portion control"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1300
Vanesa R.,"San Jose, CA",41,2,,1.0,9/24/2017,"We have gone to the Cheesecake Factory plenty of times, but this terrible experience has definitely made us reconsider ever going back. We got there at 6:50 We were amazed on how fast we got a table, but unfortunately that was the only positive thing to happen to us. After sitting for a while with out a waiter acknowledging us we had to ask for someone to helps us. We let it slide thinking it was busy for staff. We finally place our order, and I take a call at 7:20. The table next to was having a difficult time with their order; it was completely wrong and late. (We notice that the place was not as packed as we originally thought it was). 20-30 minutes later they settled and leave. By this point we ask about our food and for more bread (we are starving). They inform us it'll be out soon. Ok cool, we can deal with that.......15mins later, we check in again and we are informed that something is wrong in the kitchen so are food will be longer now, and they just walk way. They didn't ask if we wanted anymore bread or drinks. By this point we are not even hungry anymore the anger was filling our tummies. At some point the manager that had been helping the table next to us, walks up to us apologize for the delay. We calmly ask why it's taking so long, we have been sitting there waiting for our food for almost an hour. He tells us we have only been sitting for a few minutes and that he'll check when we placed our orders. He informed us that our order was only placed 30 minutes ago, it's 8:30pm!!! WTF happen to our order?!!! We paid for our drinks and walk out. We really don't care that we had to wait, we understand that something's take time and or that shit happens.

Robin H.,"San Francisco, CA",719,118,427,4.0,8/13/2016,"THE CAKE: I've had many fond memories dining at the Cheesecake Factory, mainly because the service of the staff and the quality of the dishes have been consistently excellent with every visit. My only qualms for dining @TCF is the lack of parking and long lines during peak hours (holidays and weekends), so give yourself some lead time before your meal. You'll be glad you did. THE CREAM: My TOP 10 favorites dishes: 1.  MISO SALMON_$20_Light and flakey grilled salmon in a complex sweet & savory sauce over white or brown rice (I prefer brown because it doesn't sponge up the sauce and is delightfully fun to chew). Despite its lack of veggies (the 5 snap peas are nearly raw, so I order a side salad), the sauce puts this dish on a league of its own.  2.  SKINNYLICIOUS TUSCAN CHICKEN_$17_Surprising juicy and well-seasoned chicken breasts, asparagus, cherry tomatoes in a warm & tart vinaigrette sauce. Chicken + veg = low-carb dish. 3.  BANG-BANG CHICKEN AND SHRIMP_$19_Smooth Thai coconut curry oozes with mix of exciting textures: crispy coconut flakes, juicy chicken, peanuts and vegetables served over fluffy rice. *FOOD COMA PORTION. 4. ORANGE CHICKEN_$17_Well-battered chicken takes a dip in a thick sweet/sour/savory sauce, stir-fried and served over rice. No veg. 5.  CRISPY CHICKEN COSTOLETTA_$18_Light-breaded chicken breast served w/ delightfully tart lemon sauce. Served w/ mash potatoes & asparagus. *FOOD COMA PORTION. 6.  LEMON HERB ROASTED CHICKEN_$18_For a classic comfort dinner, this hearty, well-seasoned roasted 1/2 chicken is served w/ zingy lemon sauce. Served w/ roast carrots and mash. *DINE+TAKE HOME PORTION. 7.  CHICKEN PARMESAN SANDWICH_$14_Nice balance of flavors and textures: golden breaded chicken and sweet bell peppers between two slices of cheesy rustic bread served w/ a side of marinara sauce to take this sandwich over the top. A bit heavy on butter, so I suggest a side of baby greens to add to the sandwich. *DINE+TAKE HOME PORTION.  8.  SMOKEHOUSE BBQ BURGER_$14_Burger crave? This one's sure to please. A well-seasoned beef patty is stacked with crispy bacon, cheddar, crispy onion strings, and frilly iceberg lettuce on a sweet fluffy bun. Served with creamy BBQ ranch sauce on side. I prefer baby greens over fries for less guilty meal.  9.  SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES_$11_Sweet & soft cakes w/ dynamic texture: sweet corn, course grain of corn meal in complex combination of savory sauces + the cooling effect of guac, sour cream and fresh pico de gallo salsa. Every inch of this dish is different and good to the last bite. Best when shared as it's too small to be a meal on its own. 10.  SEARED TATAKI SALAD_$19_Simple, but tasty salad w/ seared tuna and mixed baby greens, thick-sliced tomato and avo, and balsamic vinaigrette. *FAST AND LIGHT PORTION.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=240

I mostly come here with family but today I decided to come here with my boyfriend for their happy hour, which are weekdays from 4pm-6pm. The appetizers range from $5.50-$7 and the serving sizes are pretty big. Their draft beers are $4 and wines and well drinks are $5.50.  My boyfriend and I ended up ordering the fried zucchini, southern fried chicken sliders, and the crab wontons with two draft beers. When the food arrived, we were surprised at how big the portions were and became unsure if we could conquer it all. The fried zucchini was crispy and tasted delicious with the grated cheese sprinkled on top, dipped with ranch. The crispy crab wontons were also good and quite filling since it had cream cheese inside. The wontons came with a sweet chili sauce mix, which complemented the flavor of the wontons. Lastly, the southern fried chicken sliders were super delicious. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and soft, juicy meat on the inside. They put pickles, lettuce, and tomatoes on the side with two sauces. The sliders themselves were pretty big and came in four servings.  After finishing the last slider, we felt defeated and had to take the rest of the unfinished appetizers to go!

After 45 minutes of waiting, our server didn't check on us even once and we asked him what was going on since many tables his area of service was not busy.

Finally , we politely asked where our water was and he brought it in 20 seconds when we were finishing our meal. Out of respect for this restaurant chain and just by being nice ,we still left good tips but I hope the management would read this review to its staff and train servers to follow up at clients' table, offer water, and follow up if there is long wait.

My first time here but definitely not my best, also the food came pretty fast and it was better then what I expected, other people have bad experiences (according to the reviews) but maybe it's just a hit or miss.

He saw that my girlfriends and my soda was quite low so he offered to go refill it for us which was quite nice.

On the upside, across the restaurant is a designated parking lot area just for the Cheesecake Factory.  It's not very large, but better to have than not. My usual is the Miso Salmon, it never disappoints, well at least it hasn't so far.  My husband's usual favorite is the Shrimp Scampi.  However, this time round he said it was a little overcooked. The staff was very friendly and they work really hard.  Yes, you have to wait sometimes to get their attention as they zip by passing your table. Rather than wait to order dessert we thought it would be faster to just go up to the take-out counter. Wrong!  There was a line for that as well. It wasn't too bad but after placing our order it's placed into the queue between desserts ordered for dine-in and take out.  It would have been faster if I went behind the counter and retrieved it myself.   The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Cheesecake was worth the wait.  Can't say the same for the Banana Cream Cheesecake.  The restaurant is family friendly and it's not a quiet restaurant.  So kids can talk loud, laugh or cry and adults near the bar area can watch sports and cheer on their team.

For a chain restaurant, the flavors and general quality of food was better than I was expecting. We enjoyed the appetizer platter. The avacado rolls are yummy.

I only came because my friend kicked off some GCs to me (she and her husband rather give away their GCs than eat there). I've tried a good variety before, but was never satisfied until... their HIBACHI STEAK. At medium-rear, this was the best piece of steak I've had in a long time. Its got an Asian twist to it, but doesn't lack that smokey taste. It was so good, I bought one to-go for my bf.  All their other dishes were average at most. Their iced-mango raspberry drink was pretty refreshing too. I would come back here, but only to order their HIBACHI STEAK (yes, that good).

Sara B.,"Fremont, CA",44,19,,3.0,8/9/2010,"We went there on a pretty busy night, but only waitied about 20 minutes.  I ordered the herb crusted salmon salad and it was really good until I realized my salmon was still completely raw.  The salad dressing was really good too.  The manager came to the table and apologized,  took my order  back and cooked me another piece of salmon.  They still charged for it even though it was an inconviniece.  By the time I got my order again, everybody was done eating and I took it to go.  I tasted the chicken and artichoke soup, which was to die for and the warm crab dip. The dip was really good, but they didnt give enough bread for as much dip there was, and after a few bites it started to taste too much like mayonaise.  Overall the food was good, but I wish my fish was cooked all the way, and the service was great.  I would go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1400

When you ask for bread, you can ask for both white and wheat, 2 white, or 2 wheat, depending on your preference. The plates I must say are GINORMOUS, and I recommend sharing one. Given the portions, the prices are actually quite a steal, and the quality is better than most places with similar prices. So, why do you end up spending so much money here? -- the drinks and desserts, which are about $7-$10 a pop. So be careful! Of course, why go to this place without ordering a cheesecake, right? My personal recommendation is the tiramisu cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1400

Hendrick L.,"Santa Clara, CA",28,226,3,3.0,3/14/2008,"I'm not sure what happened over the years, but Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite casual dining restaurants. Their menu is still impressively large and varied, but the quality isn't quite the same any more. The food portions are HUGE, and the bread is still quite delicious, but the overall taste is now more bland... and it seems a bit more oily too. Service is still good as well, so I can't complain about that. The wait here is ridiculously long. The quality of the the cheesecake is still pretty good from what I understand (I'm not a big dessert person), but the prices are pretty absurdly expensive. Unless you're in the mood for a particular type of fancy cheesecake, you're much better off going to a place like Trader Joe's or Costco - the value there is ridiculous, and the quality really good too. Is it worth the wait? I would say it's not, so if you're curious to try out the restaurant, go when it's not as busy. Avoid the weekend evenings, especially Friday and Saturday nights. Also, they give you pagers, but I have no idea why they only work around the restaurant. It pretty much defeats the purpose if you ask me. They should take your cell and give you a call so you can pass time walking around the mall. It'll help the economy with more shopping and reduce the perceived wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1400
Roen R.,"Hayward, CA",44,125,25,4.0,9/29/2010,"I like this restaurant better than the San Francisco one, and mainly because its way less crowded and I won't die if an earthquake happens. The food here is good, the overpriced cheesecake is great, and the servers are friendly too. I like the pricing also, they serve big portions for the right price, if you come during lunch time you can catch the special lunch portion which is cheaper and they still give you a lot. I love eating at these type of restaurants because it makes me feel...fancy. I mean, I am a 18 year old teenager, with a minimum wage job and eating at a place like this is, with the price this high is like rare to me.

I'm glad I gave them one more try.  maybe I'm weird, but nothing on the desert menu appealed to me. I was looking for something light and fresh after such a HUGE meal.

Esther A.,"San Francisco, CA",645,1160,406,4.0,5/17/2006,"I used to love Cheesecake Factory ever since I first tried the Union Square location when it used to be the only one in the bay YEARS ago. So when they opened three other ones here in the bay (2 in SJ and 1 in PA) I was ecstatic b/c that means it relieves the wait at the SF one since I knew alot of these people who made their way out to the city to wait about 1.5 - 2 hours for a table were from ALL over the bay area. My sister thought I was crazy for waiting this long since she lived in so-cal at the time and they have several locations and the wait was only about 15-20 minutes, or so she claimed. I LOVE their avocado roll and their fried mac & cheese. Caloric, yes but very tasty.  I also love their selection of cheesecakes/desserts and their fruity tropical drinks.  I try to stay away from their bread that they serve b/c I need to save room for the huge portioned entrees.  Also, if you're going to order a salad, order the appetizer size b/c it is the size that you would assume you would get if you had ordered the entree size.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1400

Finally I called over the Manager to get some water. Then we waited 20 minutes to order cheesecake and the server never came. Once again I called the manager over and asked for our check. I was pissed I wanted cheesecake but I was not about to wait any longer there. The server ran our payments and there was a balance of 11.33 due. I put down cash and we left. Suddenly the server chased us out stopped my friends car and told her we owed the $11.33. My friend told the server to check because we put cash down. The server told her not to drive away as he ran in to check, sure enough the money was there. I am beyond upset with the professionalism and aloofness of the server and establishment.

Brian B.,"Livermore, CA",588,1091,123,2.0,11/12/2015,"The promise of TCF is always better than the reality. It feels like a 3 star place but I can't give it 3 and look at that ""A-OK"" tagline when it's a ""Meh"" experience. This location always has a wait because it's popular. No crime there. You put your name on the list and sit in the lobby area the size of the capitol rotunda. There are no soft surfaces and the tiny voice of the hostess is no match for the din. It's an annoying way to start the night and it's easily fixable.  The voluminous menu is overly confusing and includes advertising including one ad for an online service helping the friendless. Not a dating site. Just a site helping lonely people find other lonely people to become friends with. Festive, right?  The food seems overly fussy, a little bland and arrived just a tad on the cool side. We had no napkins and in asking for them were told that our server should have provided them. So now we have no napkins and feel like we've gotten our cheerful server in trouble. ""I can take care of that"" would have been a better response since I have zero interest in the inner workings of the processes and procedures at TCF.  The wine list could be MUCH better. Particularly the by-the-glass list. My malbec showed up slightly oxidized and tired but after the napkin moment, I frankly wasn't looking for interaction with the staff. It wasn't terrible. It's never terrible here. It's just ""meh.""

Molly M.,"North San Jose, San Jose, CA",2,19,2,1.0,1/18/2017,"We excitedly got together to celebrate 2 birthdays (group of 5) and we were disappointed from the time we came in. We were promised a 15min wait, however we had to wait 55min. Many guests who came after us, groups of 3,4,6,and 7, were seated before us. I kept asking, the manager kept telling me the same- we don't have tables for you.  So finally, we get seated, and I've never been so offended in any restaurant- our server was very dismissive, rude and not helpful at all. I asked him if he can replinish our bread basket, because we were very hungry, after waiting for a table for so long, he responded ""just wait, I can't help you now, I have other tables."" He was scolding me. I have never had this experience before. He was never available for any of our needs, so I decided to ask other servers who were passing by for our dessert, an extra orange juice drink, the receipt, and  to go boxes. Other servers were extremely pleasant and I appreciated their help. I would also mention to them that the server is no where to be found and he doesn't seem to want to serve us. They would apologize and would serve us right away.  To say the least, it was a horrible experience. I will never go back to the Valley Fair location. And I will tell all my friends and family to avoid that location as well. I spent $150 that evening and I tipped him 15%-  didn't want to because he didn't deserve the tip.  The manager was unprofessional and unhelpful, I did not want to deal with her as well. Because I asked so many times as to when our table will be ready, she offered a cheesecake slice on the house, when my bill came, I paid for all 5 cheesecakes- and I wasn't going to even try to get a slice free- I ran out of there as fast as I could.

I ordered a cheesecake and mistakenly didn't know that a whole cake came in different sizes. The waitress charges me the most expensive $55.00 cake and didn't ask what size I wanted upon taking my order. I understand that I should have checked that, but as a waitress I would have expected her to ask ""what size would you like?"" Instead of charging me for the most expensive cake.

Just went here last night for my fiancé's birthday-we ordered the California cheesesteak sandwich (comes with regular fries or onion rings) he chose both, I ordered the chipotle bow tie chicken pasta, a soda, and of course red velvet cheesecake at the end (enough to share), total bill came to $50.00! THAT IS NOT BAD AT ALL! We had plenty of food remaining, and believe me we can both grub. The onion rings are stacked up high and they are massive, the fries is large enough to be compared to size xl at fast food joints.

It offers a wide variety of foods on the menu (mostly comfort food) as well as a bunch of different deserts and drinks. Last time I went I order the eggplant parmesan and it was decent enough; I've have better before, but it was still really delicious. The price of the food is not too bad either; you can get a pretty decent sized meal for around $10-11 dollars. The problem I have with this place is how ridiculously crowded it can get sometimes. I've had wait times be as long as an hour and a half at times just to sit down at a table. That being said the service here is really good, our waitress especially was super friendly and I have to give her props for being as quick as she was considering the crowd.

It's not that they're rude, but you can tell that they're tired, or irritated...I mean, we're all human and I can empathize, but it's not an amazing dining experience, yah know? Food: Ehhhhh. Mediocre...Shrimp Scampi was good if you like a cream based sauce. Extensive menu, but very few cream sauce pasta options, and the only seafood pasta they have will only be shrimp based.  Cheesecakes: Extensive menu, and they're known for their cheesecakes! You can't go wrong.

After been put on hold for 10 mins the mgr interrogated me for 15 mins including asking me twice why I did not check the order on spot like that is the law. I ended the conversation as I felt like not wasting time on a piece of cheesecake. I used to love this restaurant but treating your customer like they want to scam you for a piece of cheesecake is not an intelligent way to grow business.

Liz W.,"Cupertino, CA",166,54,1,4.0,6/17/2015,"Their menu is so huge I'm often lost on what to eat here. But I think I finally found my favorite after many trial and error.  PRICE  - Their lunch special is fairly reasonably priced - ranging from $10-15 depending on what you pick. We had the pasta and the salad from the lunch special.  FOOD  - Their Louisiana Chicken is quite amazing for pasta! It has this right balance of cream with a bit of spice. So you can actually eat the whole plate without craving something spicy to balance the creaminess of the pasta. Also, I really liked the way the chicken was fried! The batter was crisp and the chicken was moist. Very delicious dish. 4.5/5.  - Their Luau salad was really good. I love the combination of fruits and vegetables. I did wish that the mango was a bit more ripe to bring out its sweetness. The presentation was also very pretty - with all these colorful bell pepper slices & mangoes in the midst of all the green. However, the chicken was very very dry. 3.5/5.  - Their cheesecake is excellent - honestly, I've had a lot of different types and I haven't been disappointed in any of them. I didn't get any this time around because I was stuffed, but I was very very tempted to. haha.  SERVICE - I know she had a lot of people to serve, but she was still so accommodating and nice. I love how she left a little handwritten ""thank you"" on the bill. :].  MISC  - Also, I found it interesting that their lunch special lasts all the way to 5pm! In most restaurants I've been to, lunch specials usually end around 3pm or so.  - I always found cheesecake factory a bit cold. So bring a jacket!  - One thing to note is that, we asked for the salad dressing to be on the side, and we did get the dressing on the side, but the salad still came seasoned with some sort of a sweeter dressing. I wasn't sure if that was a mistake or if the salad is pre-mixed.. but the dressing that was already on the salad and the dressing on the side that it came with had very very different flavors (the dressing on the side has more lemon, vinegar and sour taste to it). - you will always wait here. I've been to this restaurant multiple times and I've never just been able to walk in and eat hahaha. I came today on a weekday around 3pm and I still had to wait a couple minutes (literally no more than 5-10 minutes, but nevertheless, a wait).

The day was bitter cold and windy in Santa Clara and there were several women huddled at both the locked doors. Inside, one could see the manager and several workers standing around talking and laughing; they could see us standing there in the wind. I feel that management could have at least let us into the lobby area; but no, we were freezing out there with our noses pressed against the windows. I ordered the Pit Beef Dip sandwich. The flavor was fine, it was the beef that was tough and extremely fatty; literally, there were huge chunks of fat throughout the beef. After removing as much fat as I could, I was just about left with a cheese and grilled onion sandwich. I know there are a lot of people who enjoy fatty meat, but it isn't my cup of tea. The Wait Service can use some attention. Our server seemed to disappear all the time; had to constantly look around for her to get her attention.

Cheesecake factory couldn't afford to give even a tiny piece of dessert in that tiny shot glass? If it was free, then I would've just been mildly annoyed. But after we left, my friend told me that they charged us $9 for that shot of whipped cream -____- Besides that issue, the rest of the experience was okay. The wait for a table was pretty long since we had a large group. Service was average. I ordered the Miso Salmon with brown rice since the birthday girl recommended it.

Their appetizer may be the only compelling thing for folks, and of course their cheesecake. I remember how I used to go to the one in Sac, just to get the cakes. Now after realizing how BAD they are for you, I no longer go there. BUT I do have to admit that their baguette is super yummy..the wheat/brown one that is.

We've dined at multiple cheesecake restaurants so we knew we wouldn't be disappointed with the menu options. We were greeted and seated within 5 minutes of arriving. The place wasn't too busy for a Friday, I'm assuming because it was in between their lunch and dinner rush. Although it took our server a few minutes longer than it should have to greet us and get our drinks started, she was all around a pleasant server. Because my boyfriend and i are both in the restaurant industry, we offend critique the service we receive without even noticing. Despite having a pleasant experience, my boyfriend couldn't help but notice another couple who was sat at the same time as us and had not been greeted. We were probably 20 minutes into our dining and their server had walked past them multiple times. Our server, who had the section adjacent to theirs, also failed to acknowledge them. This bothered us so much that we made sure to notify a manager, simply because someone should have took it upon themselves to greet them or start their order if their server was too busy.

The bread came out at the beginning was warm and I had no intention of eating it but he broke part of the sourdough, buttered it, and made a mini sandwich and placed it on my side plate - ""Awww, right?""  Ever since he poured me my soda at Hunan House Restaurant... I was sold!  He was a gentleman and still is =) We didn't order dessert (a shocker, really) because we were both stuffed.  I didn't even need my Diet Coke refilled but he got his Coke w/ no ice refilled.. at least in the end we had a pleasant time together, a good tasting meal but we had to put up w/ the grim of our server.   Hopefully our experience will be better next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=700

I ended up waiting 2 hours on my birthday... - There are times where food just seems to take days to come out. Main courses are usually big, so it's perfect for sharing. By the time that you've downed the bread and main dish, you'd be extremely stuffed. The environment is great for big groups or a one on one dinner date.

Every cheesecake flavor I've tried here is very yummy too. But tonight, I ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta and it was disappointing. I got a mountain of pasta with not enough sauce to flavor it evenly. When I asked for more sauce, I got a small dish with too little sauce to make any difference.  Portion size in general here is a bit much for me and I would normally be okay with taking home leftovers for lunch the next day, but I really didn't want to be taking home this much bland pasta tonight.

I opted for the baked ziti and it was good, but after several spoonfuls i felt completely stuffed. The amount of cheese and cream in my dish was enough to fill me with regret from agreeing to let my friends choose the spot for our dinner date.

Maybe it was because there weren't very many goodies in my burger, as there were only a couple of mushrooms. ): However, the side salad was big, which was good since it made me feel a little better about eating the unhealthy burger. If I were to come back I'd probably not order a burger, and order one of the other million things on the menu. Regardless this is a nice restaurant to go for a dinner with family, or out with friends to catch up (like we did!) Plus, they close at 11 so we were able to take our time while eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=800

Salisbury Steak ($12.95) never fails me. I always bring home at least half for the next day's lunch. I think it tastes better the next day anyways.

No ice cream at all.  Then it took a very long time to get our check. We asked a few times of the nice waiter. It finally came.

Mike S.,"San Jose, CA",424,175,371,4.0,2/12/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory, oh the fond memories I've had at your various restaurants throughout the years. This used to be one of my favorite go to spots years ago. I'm a little amazed that you somehow haven't found your way onto one of my reviews yet. I used to appreciate you a lot more back in the days when we had to travel to San Francisco just to spend some time with you. But now that you've popped up in so many locations close by, perhaps I've taken you for granted. Last week I met up with Kim on a busy Wednesday night. You'd think on a Wednesday night there wouldn't be that many people, but then again this place always seems to be packed. Once we were seated we were served a bread basket and instantly my quest of deciding what to pick from their extensive menu with never ending choices begins. While I'm munching on my favorite, the brown oat bread I finally narrow down my choices between two dishes, the Grilled Pork Chops or the Pasta Carbonara. Btw: If you haven't tried their brown bread, you have to try it because it's so delicious. After some debate, I decided to go with the Grilled Pork Chops and Kim ordered the Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane. ( ) Grilled Pork Chops (3.5 stars) ( ) Center cut chops served with house made apple sauce, mashed potatoes, and fresh spinach. The pork chops were good and perfectly cooked, but nothing breathtaking or to die for. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes, as they were fresh and quite creamy like. Yum! To this day, I'm not sure if I've ever tried their cheesecake, which is amazing considering how many times I've come here. The problem is their portions are so huge, that by the time I finish my food or tap out, I'm overstuffed like a turkey in stage 3 food coma. Some of my favorite dishes here include: Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Avocado Egg Rolls, & Chicken Madeira. Summary (3.75 Stars): Great place for picky eaters or a large group of friends, as they offer an extensive menu with many different dishes to decide on. They also have a full bar with many delicious drinks to choose from. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=800

We made the decision to just go there afterwork and not worry about having a reservation. We sent one girl from our party to the restaurant to put our name down for a table and they informed us that they won't seat us until at least half of our table is there. We waited 40 minutes and when our party was ready we went up to the front only to find out that they gave our table away. We were furious! There was no communication and even though the girl claimed she was the manager, she never once checked in with us to see if half our party had arrived. They put our names back on the list and told us it would be another 40 minutes. We had no other options at this point so we decided to just wait it to out only to discover that they gave away our table AGAIN.

My girlfriend and I waited for about 20 minutes after our main course without acknowledgement from our server.  Normally, I wouldn't complain, business might be out of control, maybe she's covering an extra shift.  What really set us off was the way she would pass our table (5 times total) without even checking on us and prioritize other customers that were seated after us.  The server gave the couple next to us great service, and they got in a good 7-12 minutes after we were seated!  She would check on them often and bypass our table.   This is the second worse service I have received; doubt I'll return anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=800

Here's something that puzzled me: parties were given pagers while they waited to be seated... but a CF employee was still walking around calling some parties by name.  That seemed amateurish (matching the service to follow). After a long wait in the increasingly crowded (but aptly named) waiting area, our pager buzzed and we reported to the front desk.  And waited some more.  Eventually a sweaty but friendly welcomer in a black polo showed us to a booth in the back.  (Guy could have used an undershirt.)  Only five place settings were on the table, but more were brought after we asked. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly, but service was really slow for the most part.  It was a long wait for beverages and bread, and an even longer wait for the beverage order to be corrected.  Consider that we had already been waiting nearly an hour at this point.  The bread refill took just as long; the place must be really understaffed or something.  Every aspect of service was slow, except the speed-talking of the waitress.  (She was like the Micro Machines guy.) The food quality was average, probably on par with Chili's and the like, but the portions were generous to say the least.  My friend and I shared a BBQ bacon double cheeseburger ($11) and a ""tons of fun"" double cheeseburger ($11).  Impressively large, served with a large side of crisp fries.  Not great, but at least there was a lot.  One friend's chicken was on the dry side, and another's pasta was undercooked (firmer than al dente). It's easy to be floored by the size of the dishes, but the prices are high to match.  $10 for the cheapest cheeseburger, it had better be either great (no) or big (yes).  Huge salads, but they're something like $14.  $20 for the popular miso salmon or steak Diane. As expected, the waitress offered dessert (twice actually), but because of the gargantuan entrees, that was expectedly out of the question. Service was decidedly below average, but groups of seven of more pay a compulsory 18% gratuity.  Meh.  I get that it's a regular policy, but it seems like it gives the waitstaff license to be lousy. What's the deal with the lights getting progressively dimmer?  It went from bright to dark around 7:15, and dark to darker around 8.  I guess it would create a more romantic evening atmosphere, except that guest parties are seated incredibly close to one another.  All-up-ons close.  This is no gentlemen's club; I don't need strange people on my lap. As we left around 8:45, the place was still packed, with people waiting to be seated.  (No, we didn't eat incredibly slowly... the slothlike service was to blame.)  I don't really get why this place is so popular.  The cheesecake, sure... but it's like 6 bucks, 800 calories, and 50 grams of fat per slice.  My wallet and arteries clench just typing that.  Just get a much cheaper (but equally unhealthy) CF frozen cheesecake at Costco... something like $20 instead of $50.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=1460

Bryann R.,"Spokane, WA",167,26,1,1.0,1/3/2007,"Yes, that's right.  One lowly star...and they're lucky to get that after the service and crappy drinks that my boyfriend and I got at this CF last night. First of all, it took FOREVER to get seated.  I saw hella people that came in after us get seated way before us, and when I asked the hostess if maybe our pager was not working (they were starting to yell for parties to be seated), she rudely said, ""No!  Your pager is FINE!  You've only been waiting for 12 minutes!""...and then she turned around and proceeded to chat with a fellow hostess.  She's lucky I didn't get her name or else it'd be in this review.  All in all, we waited for about 35 minutes to be seated. The guy who actually sat us was very nice.  Didn't get his name though either. After we were seated, it took FOREVER for our server...Tim...to come by and introduce himself and take our drink orders.  When he did, we ordered two of their famous mojitos and waited for about 25 minutes for them.  Yes, 25 minutes FOR DRINKS!  When he did bring them, he just dropped them off and took off to go flirt with a table of 3 girls that were sitting behind us.  What was really bad was that there were 2 male servers AND the male manager at this table...all flirting with these fat, ugly chicks while they were neglecting their duties elsewhere.  After about 15 minutes of that crap, our server saw that we had put our menus down and finally came over to take our appetizer order.  Good thing THAT didn't take forever.  Maybe 'cuz it was the tuna carpaccio?  By this time, I still hadn't taken a drink of my mojito that I waited forever for.  My boyfriend had a sip of his and nearly gagged.  He asked me to try mine and see if it was ok.  Just then, a server was delivering food to the table next to us and she saw the look on my face and stopped to ask if everything was ok.  Our mojitos were PURE SYRUP!  No limes, no alcohol, just SYRUP!  Tim, our server, came by and took the drinks back and I got a Georgia Peach and my boyfriend got a Corona instead.  I HATE having to send drinks or food back because I always feel rude for doing so, but after we sent those mojitos back, our server didn't come by hardly at all after that.  It was almost as if he was avoiding us!  Finally, we ordered our food and then waited 45 MINUTES for it!  Our food was wonderful, but the service was terrible.  As I mentioned before, our server was avoiding us, and when my boyfriend finally flagged him down to order another Corona, he took his sweet time flirting with all the waitresses along the way.  We had to ask another server who was passing by to get the 2nd beer. After we were done eating, I had to flag our server down to get a to-go box.  He offered to box up my food for me, but I told him I'd rather do it myself and save the time (and spit)!  He asked if we would like any dessert and I asked him, ""Well, how long is THAT going to take?""  He said, ""Why, do you have to be somewhere at a certain time?  Do you have a movie to catch?""  I sharply said no and that I would just like the check.  He was completely oblivious to his crimes!  He had NO IDEA that he was LAGGING like that! I'm sure he got the hint with a $2.14 tip on a $60 tab.  Yes, I feel horrible for tipping so little, but the guy didn't even earn that $2.14.  I wanted to stiff him completely, but my boyfriend talked me out of it.  I understand that the lagging may not have been ENTIRELY Tim's fault, but still.  Don't flirt with chicks, don't piss off the bartender so your drinks are slow to come, don't piss off the kitchen so your food is slow to come, and don't avoid your customers when you're the one that delivered a horrible product.  Better yet, Tim, just quit the restaurant job.  Obviously you're only in it for the chicks.  The fat, ugly chicks. I will NEVER go back to this CF EVER again.  From now on, my money can go to the Oakridge CF...where I've always had service and food/drinks that was above and beyond.

This is one of my favorite places to eat when you don't mind waiting to be seated. You get most-of-the-time fresh bread when you're seated, sourdough and thier rye/wheat kind that people rave about along with butter. Some of the things I suggest: the appetizer fried mac-n-cheese ( 3 large balls of mac-n-cheese breaded and fried served with someone kind of marinara cream sauce), the chicken and biscuits (served with a hearty serving of mashed potatoes), grilled cheese sandwich (if you're feeling simple, served with large portion of fries), cajun chicken littles(huge portion, gotta eat with a sauce, some may think it's a bit bland), chicken madeira, and I also hear the burgers are great. Thier salads are like mountains, it could easily serve 3 side salads. Thier breakfast of eggs, thick bacon, and hashbrowns is awesome- not greasy like diners. If you're going to order dessert I highly suggest one thing, and it aint' even cheesecake. It's the fresh strawberry shortcake. Holy crap my mouth is salivating. The shortcake, somehow, it's almost crispy, the ice cream is delicious and the strawberry syrup and strawberries are just right. It's huge, and if you've got a sweet tooth you could eat it just as your meal-that's how filling it is. You're going to have leftovers, I promise you.

Gene A.,"Brooklyn, NY",244,412,25,1.0,3/28/2007,"Aside from the huge portions of food that is mediocre at best, this happened awhile back and is why I gave this place one star: I went the Cheesecake Factory at the Valley Fair Mall with my now, ex-girlfriend. Upon eating our Thai Lettuce Wrap appetizer, I bit down on something hard. It turned out to be one of those plastic tabs that hold bread bags together. I immediately called a waiter over. A manager came by to tell us that the appetizer was going to be ""taken care of"". Later, the waitress lagged on serving us, more particularly, taking 10-15 minutes to fetch a simple glass of wine. Again, it took another 10-15 minutes to receive the bill, and when we did, we found that the appetizer was still on the bill. I then asked to speak to a manager. All he offered was to ""take care"" of the appetizer, to which, I gave him a look of awe and anger. He then offered free cheesecake, to which i gave him another look of dissatisfaction. I then said to him, ""You're the manager. You obviously want to take care of the customer. What do you feel is necessary to do so?"" He ended up giving us a 30 dollar gift card which only covered half of our meal. This also took another 10 minutes to get. Not only that, but we ended up not being able to go to see a movie, which we've been planning on seeing for over a month. Furthermore, one of the servers disclosed the fact that another customer found a rubberband in his broccoli the other day. In summary, they (the Cheesecake Factory) are lucky that a little child or anyone else did not choke on that plastic tab.

It was my girlfriends 19th birthday and she had a party of 28. Being that none of the restaurants take reservation she got there and hour early to make her ""in-person"" reservation at 6:30. Time went by an as 7:30 rolled around the hostess told her and her guest we would be waiting 45 minutes to be seated. Some of our party went into the mall to shop a bit, came back and its now 8:30. Still not seated. At this point 2 of our guest left and hostess where telling us the party in the section for us had just put in there order. Note that my friend put in her reservation at 6:30. I don't understand WHY we did not get seated till 10! 4 hours of waiting. It did not take this party ahead of us 4 hours to eat. On top of that all we paid our check in full and the waitress somehow add and additional $56.98 to our tab when the check CLEARLY had the TAX and TIP printed clear on the check. The manager paid for 2 appetizers and the birthday girls cheesecake. 2 appetizers! For a 26 guest party. I'm very upset about the extra fee our party had to throw in last minute and it didn't seem like the waitresses waiting us were very happy at our large party. Its unacceptable that it took 4 hours for us to be seated and looks 2 of our guest in the process. I will not be attending San Jose/Santa Clara Cheese Cake Factory any time soon and will tell all my loved ones to do that same. Not good for big partys...

The food is always solid - I usually do the spicy cashew chicken (not spicy in the least but it is delicious). The huge portions ensure you'll have you'll have something to eat for lunch the next day. I do have a soft spot for their cheesecakes. My faves are the red velvet and the banana cream. The Valley Faire location is always insanely busy so definitely expect a bit of a wait, both to be seated and to get your food. Because of how full it always is, it also tends to be pretty loud.

Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. There is nothing too special but it has what I need. I usually come here for two things : happy hour and pasta da vinci. No matter where I go, I always come back to pasta da vinci. It's just one of those heavy and comfort foods that I gravitate towards once in a while.  Pasta Da Vinci - creamy pasta with chicken & mushrooms. It has a nice creamy consistency without it being too overwhelmingly rich. Tamales - savory with a little bit of sweentness which makes a good combination of yumminess. Buffalo wings - just your typical wings. It's nothing special but it's good. Chicken sliders - same, nothing special but good. Parking can be b****. Especially when it's close to valleyfair. Those who have been here during the holidays know how crowded it can get and finding a parking space can be challenging unless you're willing to do valet or pay 5$ to park in their small lot.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2

CeeJay F.,"San Jose, United States",662,21,90,5.0,28/12/2017,"Just wanted to start my review by giving Jaimie a big big ""Thank You!"" for her excellent service tonight on my parent's anniversary dinner. Very patient with us, asked if we had any questions with the menu, and checked in time to time to see if we needed anything after getting our food.  Thank you for going above and beyond by making my parents a little Happy Anniversary dessert plate after you guys said you usually don't, only for birthdays. I really appreciate it so much that you made it happen. It made our whole dining experience tonight an amazing one, ending it on a high note. I always get the combo items every time I come here because you get two items for around $23 and it's really not a bad deal at all. It's a great selection of combos and it gets you pretty full.  But I thought I'd try something new tonight...and when I asked about the Miso Salmon, Jaimie pretty much sold it to me and I'm really glad that I ordered that tonight. I'm happy to have found my second favorite dish to get there besides the combos, the first one being the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. I think it's wonderful that you have an option of brown rice as well which is what I got with my Miso Salmon dish. The brown rice wasn't dry and was not too moist either, it was perfect. The salmon itself was great! Perfectly cooked, complemented well with the sauce on the sides all around the plate. I paired the rice and the sauce because it tasted so good. Haha. Plating was very appealing! (I recommend this dish if anyone wants to try something new within the Salmon area) For you with venturous taste buds, my little brother got the Macaroni and Cheese Burger. It's actually pretty good! He says it's cheesy and the patty was cooked perfectly (medium well). It sure will get you full and it comes with a side choice of fries and I believe the other choice was salad? I might be wrong. But this was another really great dish!  My cousin ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Portion was good! He said it was pretty spicy! It had green pasta, the shrimp was peeled and it didn't have a tail, so it was easy to eat! It also came with chicken and the chicken was tender itself. Another dish he recommends to get if you're looking for anything in the pasta area! The environment is just like any other Cheesecake Factory, a little dark and intimate. Taking pictures is a little hard, but nothing a flash can fix. The wait also varies on what day you go and time. But it is worth the wait! Next time I'll make room for cheesecake! Haha.

Cindy M.,"San Jose, United States",197,338,856,3.0,19/9/2017,"Another birthday meal at TCF, this time dinner. Monday night and the wait was only 10 minutes. Our server Adeline wasn't the most enthusiastic, but was friendly. We'd later find out that she was slightly forgetful. Not trying to be hard on her but I'm going to be honest and give 3 stars instead of 4 stars for this visit. I would recommend that empty plates be removed when your server comes to the table. That wasn't done initially. Later in the meal it was.  For starters, our group had the eggroll sampler. Loved two out of the four (firecracker and salmon). Moving on to the chicken sliders deluxe. There were four large sliders with a side of fries. This alone would probably be good if you were here for drinks and appetizers. We weren't about to stop there, not this time. Onto the entrees. Birthday guest had Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms. As you know, the portions are huge so half was packed up the next day. Second meal was the Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger which was enjoyed thoroughly by a burger-holic. Nice combo of bacon topped with pork belly. They barely finished it. Third meal was the surf & turf w/ Steak Diane Salmon combo w/ asparagus. Asked for med-rare on both fish and steak, but it was slightly overcooked in my opinion. The Steak Diane was okay. Salmon was good.  Both red wines I had were tasty. However, the Lyric Pinot Noir was better than the red blend. Finally, dessert was on the radar. During our dinner we heard about six birthday songs so we were in good company. Our server had a buddy come over to help her sing and our group joined in of course. The birthday guest was presented with a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake decorated nicely with the typical hot-fudge birthday wish written on the plate, colorful sprinkles, mounds of whipped cream and a birthday candle. It was oh so good. Light and creamy. Kids hot fudge sundae was good as well.  TCF is still the most diverse menu for your dining experience. Does it always knock your taste buds out of the park...? No, not really, but you can satisfy any craving nonetheless.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2
Shaun H.,"San Jose, United States",161,263,293,3.0,4/11/2017,"If there's a restaurant on the planet with a larger selection of menu items than The Cheesecake Factory I would be surprised.  The waitress placed a tome in front of each of us, it made a heavy thud.  Reading it was a project, decisions, decisions.  We needed more time, so we ordered drinks, a classic stall tactic.  Then a couple appetizers:  dynamite shrimp and cuban rolls. Finally we ordered.  I had chicken madeira.  My three dining partners had jambalaya pasta, salmon and hibachi steak.  The drinks and appetizers came quickly.  The dynamite shrimp were tiny fried shrimp with some slightly spicy dipping sauce.  Meh.  The Cuban rolls were an egg roll cut in half, stuffed with shredded pork, ham, melted cheese and some pickle-mustard sauce.  Cuban sandwich fillings in an eggroll?  Some fusion is bomb, this was a bit of a dud.  Not bad but not fantastic. Our main courses took a long long time.  I'm sure it's hard for the kitchen to support such a large menu.  So many things to cook.  My chicken madeira was burnt on the bottom, not charred, burnt.  It took me a few bites to get past that, but he sauce was decent.  My dining partners all reported that their entrees were ""ok."" We all ordered cheesecake to go.  I had my strawberry cheesecake later that night and it was super good. The Cheesecake Factory can be great, depending on what you order and who cooks it, but it can also be just ok.  I've never had a bad meal here, but it seldom blows me away.  The wide selection is great for groups with picky eaters because there is literally something for everyone.  However that large menu comes at a price.  They don't master it all.  Still, it's worth the occasional visit, especially for dessert.  I have never had a bad cheesecake here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2

While I haven't tried dining here for their actual food, I've had plenty of their cheesecakes. But hey it's called The Cheesecake Factory, not Overpriced Pasta Factory. If I wanted that, I would go to Maggiano's across the street.  The Mango Key Lime Cheesecake topped with a mango mousse on a thick vanilla coconut macaroon crust is my favorite. Any cheesecake needs a good amount of citrus to balance out that fatty filling. The mango offers a unique tartness that the other cakes don't, including strawberry (which would be my second). The cheesecakes are great, service even for a supposed grab-and-go setup was and is always terrible, and the interior albeit nice is way too dark.

Shelby N.,"Santa Clara, United States",148,1,,1.0,12/1/2018,"Me and my son wanted to spend quality time  and enjoy food from the cheesecake factory and we ordered door-dash, but the manager Crystal was super rude and disrespectful not only to us but to the man who was working for door-dash. She blamed everyone else for her mistakes and was very condescending when I asked her questions about my order, because of her lack of communication skills and rude mannerisms I will never order door dash from here again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=20
Felicia C.,"Menlo Park, United States",221,86,213,3.0,9/7/2017,"The interior of Cheesecake Factory is beautiful and very clean. It was also really crowded so I suggest coming here early. We came at 5:30 and our food was brought at 6:45. We waited about an hour for our food, but in the meantime, the waiter brought us some bread, wheat and sourdough. My friends and I ordered the jambalaya pasta, eggplant Parmesan, original cheesecake, and tiramisu cheesecake. Jambalaya pasta- The pasta had a unique flavor to it. It's basically jambalaya mixed with pasta. There were some shrimp and chicken in the dish. The sauce was very yummy. I would order this again. Eggplant Parmesan- The fried eggplant was extremely oily. So oily to the point that I didn't want to finish the dish. The outside wasn't crispy anymore. But the cheese and the marinara sauce was really good. The eggplant also came with some pesto pasta which was even more oily. I don't think I would order this dish again. Onto dessert!!! Original cheesecake- YESSSS! This is what they're famous for. It was creamy and tasted sooo good. Probably one of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted, so I would definitely order this again. Tiramisu cheesecake- I expected it to taste at least a little like cheesecake, but it didn't at all. The tiramisu flavor overpowered the cheesecake flavor, so basically it was just tiramisu. I would have liked some cheesecake flavors, and this disappointed me, so I don't think I would order this again. Overall my experience at Cheesecake Factory was ok. The service was really slow and some dishes I didn't really like. The next time I go here, I will order new dishes to try, and I hope the service is faster.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=20
Shannon W.,"Cupertino, United States",1664,159,490,2.0,1/7/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Westfield Valley Fair in West San Jose, next to Macy's mens. We came on a Saturday for lunch at 1pm, and got seated within 5 minutes. The hostess was very nice! We got the crab cake appetizer ($13) and factory combo: herb crusted salmon and filet mignon with mashed potatoes ($22.50). The food came pretty fast, around 15-20 minutes. However, I didn't have a great experience for the value. For a lunch costing a total of $45 for 2, with only one appetizer and one entree, it was VERY little food.  The crabcakes appetizer comes with THREE crabcakes, with like a 2 inch diameter, tiny!! The two sauces were great, but it's not proportional to the amount of crabcake they gave! Delicious, but really not worth it.  The salmon and filet mignon pieces were also extremely small. The salmon was like 2x4 inches, and not incredibly good. The filet mignon was 3 small, thin pieces.. They didn't skimp on the mashed potato though. Gave an awful lot of that. But that's not worth $23 is it.  Also, I really like the wheat grain bread at the Cheesecake chains. So the first waiter for 1 wheat grain and 1 sourdough bread, and my friend and I finished that. so we asked for some more wheat grain bread, and it took 25 minutes for that to come out. We finally got to eat some bread.. after we finished our meal. It also took a really long time to flag someone down and give us a check.  This place has the decor, good location, and fine food, but the portions are incredibly skimpish and the service is lacking. I would not come back again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=20

Favorites of mine are their chicken madeira, chicken marsala and pastas. The interior is dim and moody but loud/lively. It is good for a family dinner or date (but not a first date...since the volume in here is pretty loud and maybe it might be hard to converse).

Alison Y.,"Fremont, United States",506,74,316,2.0,14/6/2017,"The only time I think of coming to The Cheesecake Factory is if I'm going with a large group to celebrate something. They're great for accommodating big parties, so I'll give them that. But in terms of their food, I'd much rather eat elsewhere.  We got here a little before 6:00 PM on a Sunday (after a failed attempt to eat at Din Tai Fung, which had an estimated 2 hour wait time - yikes!!), and we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The first part of our dining experience went pretty smoothly. Getting our drinks, ordering, and receiving our appetizers (and their delicious complimentary bread) all happened in a timely manner.  APPETIZERS: The WARM CRAB & ARTICHOKE DIP was very flavorful and paired really with their crunchy grilled bread! This was definitely the highlight of the meal for me. The NASHVILLE HOT CHICKEN NUGGETS were pretty good as well and not that spicy thankfully.  MAIN COURSE: Everything that went wrong during this portion of the meal is why I'm only giving this restaurant 2 stars. Strike #1: My mom ordered a Filet Mignon, and they didn't bring her a steak knife. She had to flag down our server to ask for one, which took some time. Strike #2: My dad ordered an omelette, which was offered with a side of potatoes or tomatoes. He went with tomatoes, and when the dish was delivered, there were no tomatoes. He had to ask about it, and our server eventually brought it out for him after. Strike #3: My brother ordered the factory combination with Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira. And there was a piece of plain cooked pasta in his dish when his order clearly had no pasta items. Seems like sloppy food service or poor quality control to me... And lastly, I ordered pasta with shrimp and sausage, which was just average.  DESSERT: How could you come to The Cheesecake Factory and not get a slice of cheesecake? We went with a slice of the mango key lime, which was a great option if you're looking for a not-so-sweet option.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=20

My friends and I weren't too hungry so we just shared their Wild mushroom soup, fried Mac n cheese balls, and their four cheese pasta. I told her I really like their wild mushroom soup ( which they only served on Wednesdays) and she was so nice to give me a free small one to-go when I left ! I was surprised at the nice gesture. +1 star for that.  The rest of the food was decent but the thing that made it ok was the price, everything at cheesecake it a little bit higher priced than I would've liked. Oh and don't forget about the complimentary wheat bread (or brown bread some people say), I always ask for extra of that stuff !

Cathleen F.,"Sunnyvale, United States",23,16,5,1.0,27/12/2017,"For horrendous service, this restaurant takes the (cheese)cake. If zero stars was an option, that would have been a no-brainer. 1. Very short staffed. Everything took a very, very long time. 2. Two out of four of our bread plates were visibly dirty. 3. They were out of fish for their Fish 'n' Chips (my husband doesn't eat meat, so that matters to us). 4. My pasta dish was terrible. 5. The customer service was horrible. My husband and I arrived at 9pm on a Tuesday night, the day after Christmas, with our two year old and four year old, for a nice anniversary dinner. Our main mission was cheesecake, but we decided to have some dinner first. It was crowded but the wait was only about twenty minutes, so that was reasonable to us. We were seated at our table and after five minutes or so, our waitress came by and took our drink orders. When she came a while later, we mentioned that our plates were dirty and asked if she could bring new ones when she brought the bread. I heard her mention to our neighboring table that they were out of bread and that they were making more, so I knew it would be a while (and it was). But when she came to bring the bread a while later, no new plates. Waited a while for new plates. We knew what we wanted but waited quite some time, again, for the waitress to come take our orders. Then we went to place said order only to find out they were out of fish. We picked a replacement item fairly quickly but it still took a very long time to get the food. When the food arrived, my husband's eggplant parmesan was great, but my dish (Shrimp with Angel Hair with the basil garlic lemon cream sauce from the Bistro Shrimp Pasta dish) was terrible. It was watery, flavor-less, and seemed to be missing any trace of salt (I never thought I'd say this of a big chain restaurant, where salt is never in short supply). It looked somewhat creamy, but very, very watery. I tried salting it a couple times and mentioned it to the waitress so she brought some parmesan. That didn't make a big difference so she offered to bring some alfredo sauce. That kind of helped, but by that point it had been a long time and I had just sort of given up hope. My kids were eating the plain pasta (as most kids would), and I ate what I could so as not to be wasteful. Even without kids (who were being so well behaved and patient), I would not have wanted to extend my stay at that restaurant any longer by ordering something else or having it re-made. Not that that was even offered.  After experiencing the super slow service, dirty plates, and dissatisfying food, we thought it prudent to try to resolve it with a manager. We explained the issues to him, were very friendly, understanding and empathetic, and he seemed personable and apologetic. After listening and explaining that they were very short staffed, apologizing for the pasta dish not turning out very well, he offered a cheesecake as a resolution. In my head, I was thinking a whole cheesecake is pretty expensive and probably more than we need, but maybe they have small ones. And even then, if my pasta dish was $20 and a cheesecake is maybe $50, cost of food + bad experience = not that excessive in terms of compensation. So our waitress asks what kind of cheesecake we'd like, we tell her we'd like the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake, but to go (2 year old was starting to fall asleep at the table, can't blame him). When she comes with our to-go bag, there's one small slice of cheesecake in it. My husband and I look at each other like, um, is this happening right now? Is this worth fighting over? We ask the waitress for clarification, she explains yes, the one slice is intentional. She goes on to explain that when things go wrong, that's their go-to solution, one slice of cheesecake, and implies that the real problem is that I still ate my plate of pasta. I caught the manager again on our way out and he mansplained about their customer service, laughed at the idea of a whole cheesecake, and again faulted me for eating the dish. He went on about how they rush a replacement to you for a mess-up dish when I mentioned not wanting to wait any longer. Also threw in that they give you bread/salad while you wait. I mentioned how long we waited for bread, that the waitress had said they were out in the beginning, and he corrected me and said they're never out of bread, you just have to wait 10 minutes for more to be made. If your customer service is working, you shouldn't have to explain how it's working. If your food and service are good, you don't even get to that point. If you resolve any issues that DO arise well, the customer leaves even happier than they would have been if everything was great to begin with. The kicker? We get home and discover they gave us the wrong flavor cheesecake. (Happy anniversary, sweetheart!) We're friendly, patient, and tip 20-100% and had to leave this place without leaving a tip. The management desperately needs to get its act together.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=20
Mitzy B.,"Santa Rosa, United States",543,297,40,4.0,5/9/2017,"110 degrees at noon on a Saturday means time to enjoy the cool relief of someone else cooking lunch for you. After a random adventure around the mall, the husband and I rewarded ourselves with a ""small"" lunch at The Cheesecake Factory (I say ""small"" because anyone who's ever been here knows none of their portions are small) We had the pleasure of having Greg as our server who had a great energy, good suggestions for our meal, and made great conversation. We've had a recent history of some not so great restaurant servers so it was very refreshing!  Unfortunately, they were out of the ""Pizza-Style"" Chicken parmesan, but we were very pleased with our second choice of Pineapple crusted chicken and shrimp dish. We split this and ended the meal with Adam's Peanut Butter pie. Holy richness! I love oreo cookie crust but was so happy we split this - I needed to be carried out afterward.

I ended up going with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was a very big portion of chicken served with green beans + mashed potatoes.  To be honest, I'd say the food was fairly basic and felt like a standard chain restaurant (think of Olive Garden or Outback). Not bad, but nothing to write home about (I'd say there are better choices for the price imo).

The restaurant wasn't too busy, so we were able to get seated right away. But for not being so busy, we waited a long time for service in general. It took a while for our server to introduce herself and get our drinks. It then took 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out, which is not Jon Taffer approved! Our waitress was nice and friendly though.  The food at the Cheesecake Factory tasted good but was far off what I expected. We ordered, for instance, the Nashville hot chicken nuggets. They were definitely no Hattie B's hot chicken from Nashville. I didn't think they tasted anything like Nashville hot chicken at all actually. Nashville hot chicken is also drenched in the sauce. Cheesecake Factory has the sauce only on one side of the nuggets. For what they were, however, the nuggets were yummy. The Shepherd's pie, which was my entree, was good but didn't exactly taste like a shepherd's pie to me. It was so saucy, and the beef sauce was very thick.

Liz C.,"Santa Clara, United States",431,506,2328,3.0,5/2/2017,"I know Cheesecake Factory always gets mediocre reviews but for some reason I keep coming back. It's not like the food is phenomenal, but it's oddly comforting. I came to this specific location for my birthday with my significant other. It was a Friday night and crazy busy as you would expect. They told us it would be about 25 minutes for a booth to open up. We waited like the rest of the crowd. Once our buzzer started ringing, we were seated. If you didn't already know, Cheesecake Factory has a huge, huge menu. Furthermore, their portion sizing here is no joke. Appetizers are the size of full entrees and entrees could probably  feed two mouths. Since it was my birthday, we decide to do a bit of splurging. We wanted the tuna carpaccio but they were unfortunately out of tuna for the night. We decided to go with the buffalo blasts and the calamari to start.  The buffalo blasts are really interesting. I have never had anything like it and it's pretty hard to describe. They are deep fried to the point where they almost taste like fried chicken on the outside. They are inside what seems like a wonton wrapper and the inside is a buffalo chicken, cheese mix. It's soft and squishy on the inside but extra crunchy on the outside. It comes with blue cheese dip but my s/o and I thought ranch would be better so we kindly asked our server for some.  The calamari is pretty standard. I think there is so much breading on the calamari that you can barely taste the seafood. Thankfully, the outside is pretty crunchy. Some places don't know how to make calamari crunchy on the outside so it ends up being squishy.  We wanted to take leftovers home so ended up ordering two entree sized pastas (way too much food). I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta while my s/o chose the jambalaya cajun pasta. I actually really like the Louisiana chicken pasta. The bow tie pasta is smothered in creamy sauce and the chicken is breaded thinly. It was my first time trying the jambalaya cajun pasta and it was underwhelming. I actually think it had barely any flavor at all. The sauce was pretty tasteless unless your bite had a bit of the sausage, shrimp and veggies. I personally just didn't really like this one. It didn't even gain any more flavor after sitting in the fridge overnight (which you would think would allow the flavors to sit some more). I ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake to-go because there was no way we would be able to fill our stomach anymore. This cheesecake is a mix of fudge cake and original cheesecake in one piece. It was the perfect thing for me because I wanted cake for my birthday, but also was craving cheesecake. It's super rich and indulgent of course, but that's my kind of treat! The server came over with a couple other servers and sang me Happy Birthday and had other tables join in. I never told my server how old I was turning, but he thought I was turning 21. I guess this birthday I lost years in my age! None the less, I appreciated that they came and sang for me and gave a complimentary mousse type thing with a candle even though it was so, so busy. Because it was so busy, service was a bit slow but we were still checked up on here and there and had our needs met.  Overall - not bad. I still enjoy coming here with my s/o to indulge and of course, get dessert.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=40
Jenny O.,"San Jose, United States",250,211,975,3.0,7/3/2017,"Haven't been to this place in a while but since I had a gift card and a free slice of cheesecake, I decided to drop by. I love the cheesecakes here and I am always satisfied with whatever slice I decide to go with.  The lunch specials are not bad for the price ($13-$16) for a large plate of food, but the regular menu items are pretty expensive for what it is. I finally tried the much so raved about miso salmon and everyone's right - it IS delicious! The salmon wasn't overcooked and the hoisin-like sauce was delicious. I made sure to soak up every last drop with my jasmine rice. But for a $20+ dish I expect more than 5 snap peas please! And of course, I gotta have my brown bread. That sh*t is crack and I can eat loaves at a time!! I asked for some on the way out and the waiter said they were out of the brown bread. I know I was being shady for trying to take some to go, but how dare they lie to me especially since another waiter just brought some out to the table next to us. Guess the shader (me) got shaded, lol. Gripe: There's literally nowhere to park right now and it's $4 valet parking with validation - $25 without (ridiculous). And of course, there is ALWAYS a wait. It was about a 20+ minute wait for 2 on Saturday at 3PM - I can't imagine going with a larger group. Service is mediocre and is slow per usual.

Dang L.,"San Jose, United States",8,132,183,2.0,12/3/2017,"We came here on a Friday night. Paid for the valet parking lot because there wasn't anywhere to park. When we got in at 730pm, there was a 40-50 minute wait. I had predicted this would happen, but the hubby had insisted. These two issues wouldn't have bothered me so much as the rest of my experience all cumulated.  We got seated and it took 15 minutes for our waiter to come by. We ordered. He was supposed to come back with drinks. Got the bread. 10 minutes, water and appetizer. Still waiting for the drinks. Waiter said he was going to bring it over. 5minutes later he brought one drink and said he was going to come back with the other drinks. Waited another 15 minutes. Got the food. Still. I drink. Half way through the meal he checked on us. We asked for the drink and they finally bought it. I realize it's busy but still. Now after venting: Mac and cheese ball - 4 stars. Probably the best dish of the night. Although is quite salty, the creamy tomato dish takes it to another level.  Sirloin with mash potatoes and veggies- 2.5. The hubby ordered well done. It came between medium and rare. But too hungry so he ate it anyways but left about 1/3. Because it was too rare for him. Mash potato- standard although on the saltier side.  Clam chowder - 3 stars. Good but nothing outstanding to rave about.  Steak tacos- comes with 3 tacos, beans & rice. Topped with chopped onions, salsa, guacamole and cilantro. Pretty decent but I didn't like the fact that it tasted sweet with a lingering after taste. Will not order again. - should be mostly savory for a taco.  Greek salad- 1 star. Mostly leafy greens with 2 olives and a couple if tomato and cucumber slices. It literally had no taste except the saltiness  of the feta. Had to ask for a dressing - balsamic. Then it was better. I was told they did toss it in a dressing.  Over all the low stars for the service and disappointed food prep. Maybe going on busy hour may not be a good idea. But I've been to 5 different cheese cakes factory throughout California and have eaten here before too. This was the worst one.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=40

Alberto V.,"Salinas, United States",6,116,150,4.0,12/9/2017,"It's the Cheesecake Factory... The place is upscale, the food is fancy, the cheesecake portions are huge! Depending on when you come in will determine how long of a wait you'll have for a table. Normally weekends are the busiest. Obviously! Expect to wait anywhere from 30-40 min to be seated. Once seated the waiters are always kind and friendly. I've yet to have a rude waiter here. In my opinion the food is delicious and very well presented. Pricing is a bit up there but portion wise you do get what you pay for. Their cocktails are packed with flavor and not overly strong. For me this is a good thing. Cheesecake! Hello! You can't leave the Cheesecake Factory without a piece of cake. Even if you're full I highly recommend taking a slice home. A plus is coming here for your birthday. My girlfriend loves it when they come with her cheesecake decorated with HBD and a candle. A simple gesture goes a long way. Oh, and by the way if you don't want the signing simply ask your waiter not to bring the staff and make a scene. Otherwise be like my girl and ask if the entire restaurant can sing you happy birthday. lol...  Lastly; I docked a star because parking is always complicated even with the valet service.

Jana E.,"Hayward, United States",46,24,37,1.0,29/12/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory quite a few times. But today is a different story. I'm writing this review because of the horrible horrible service that my family and I received today. Our server was SLOANE.. she needs a bit more training on how to serve her customers. I don't want to put her on blast like that but it's seriously needs to be done. Because the service we received was so bad that I am absolutely upset.  First of all, she NEVER checked up on us. Second, she forgot to give us whatever it was that we asked for. For example I asked for a new plate because it was dirty and had crumbs all over it. She NEVER came back with a plate.. and by the time I reminded her, our appetizers were finish. Well, what's the point. Ok so she MIGHT have been busy. But not really because there was empty tables. Well we gave her the benefit of the doubt. Ok well then when we asked for straws for the whole table, she completely forgot... AGAIN! I tell you, I'm not sure what it was but either she didn't like us? I'm not sure what the case was. Third, everyone in our section who sat AFTER us got their food BEFORE US. We ordered a turkey BLT, fish tacos and a miso salmon. I don't think it's that much. And a big party was eating way before us. And she was their server as well. It took about 35-40 minutes from when we ordered (we ordered right when we sat down because we were looking at the menu while waiting to be seated) to get our food. And in those 35-40 minutes she forgot about giving us our plate and straws and never checked up on us. The only thing she did for us right away was giving us our check when we asked for it. It was in less than 1 minute she came back with our check. Figures...  -- btw I'm not trying to say cheesecake servers are horrible because we seen the wonderful service other tables were getting. Just not us for some odd reason.  Anyway Sloane or management if you're reading this it's quite upsetting to see how this is such a great restaurant but it seems that some staff possibly favors other tables more. (PS; I've come to this locations plenty of times and never ever had a problem with our servers.

Small kale salad was plenty for entree and the server was great not to push a full size salad. We also had the chicken Cesar and bang bang chicken in our party and they were both very tasty. Bang bang chicken was not the traditional flavor that we are used to but was still good.  We always walk out with to go bag from Cheesecake Factory due to their large portions.

Stephen C.,"Campbell, United States",343,264,1063,1.0,11/12/2016,"Did not have a good dining experience at Cheesecake. This dinner took place December 10th, beginning at 6:45pm. We had a party of 5 people. It was a 45 min wait. It was fine. We understood. Saturday night. it was poppin. When we got to the front desk... we missed our window to grab the table by 5 mins. They put us back into the queue. Told us we had to wait another 20mins. After a while we  go up to the counter to check if we were up next. They said they already called our name when we were literally standing in front of the host/hostess desk. We continue to wait 10+ mins before we get seated.  Putting aside the long wait..it was time to order. I ordered the Crispy Shrimp Sandwich. After a long ass time... the food begins to come out. They hand me a crispy chicken sandwich...and i say nope. i didnt order this. As any consumer, you just immediately realize that if this is the sandwich that made for you... they are going to have to start from scratch and make it again. It's going to take forever. But again... things happen... so as the others eat... I wait for my sandwich to come. What's odd is that I understood why i had not gotten my food. But my friend who ordered a Cuban sandwich ALSO hadn't gotten his food neither. With no explanation to WHY he hadn't gotten his food.. we were both left waiting. My food finally comes out after another 20 mins. It's now 8:30. My crispy shrimp sandwich arrives. But WHERE WAS THE CUBAN SANDWICH?! But the best part about it was, WITHOUT any explanation, his sweet potato fries came out without the Cuban sandwich. I guess it was still lagging behind LOL. It was 8:40pm when the sandwich finally decided to come out. 3 other people at the table had finished their meals when we took our first bite.  I was waiting to the end of the meal before I started to rating this meal to see if the waiter or the manager or anyone working at cheesecake was going to do anything for our inconvenience. I understand mistake happens. I understand when it gets busy... people get flustered and even drop the ball from time to time. And that is perfectly okay. It is ALWAYS about how you treat the customer and making a bad situation into a better one. But NOPE... NOPE...NOPE...NOPE.  Our waitress said sorry probably like 10 times but that does nothing for our meal. It wasn't completely her fault. It was the entire crew at Cheesecake. I am a huge fan of this place. It is just disappointing that I was looking forward to eating here and this is what we get....  Overall stats: waited over an hour before getting seated. took over an hour to get everyone's food. People already finished eating before the last person got their dish. Where was the manager? Would have been nice if he/she came over to make sure all the customers are satisfied but hey... ""Cheesecake was probably busy"" ""there were probably another issue he/she had to take care of."" Either way... we were left in the dark. Nothing was compensated. For that night, Cheesecake Factory offered a horrible dining experience. Will not return any time soon.  Thanks for reading my rant.

Later, I got a call from a guy from corporate who was very nice and seemed genuine in passing the message onto the real guy who is in the ""Investigation Dept"" (who was out of the office on time off).  A few weeks went by, nothing.  2nd thing I did:  I called back to corporate and asked to talked to this ""guy"" in the Investigation dept. He didn't seemed to know of my story (perhaps it was never communicated to him) and came off flustered. After telling my story again, he said he would look into it but that without any tangible evidence or police report, this was going to be a tough one.

The food and service are always consistent except for my last visit. This negative review is solely based on the service my friend and I had.  Jessica N. was our server during brunch. I can say with confidence that I've never received such rude service from any server as I received from her.  We ordered two pasta dishes and one Bloody Mary. During our meal, I took only three sips of my drink and really did not like it. When we got our bill, I asked her if she could take the drink off the bill since I hardly drank it and was unsatisfied. She replied by yelling, ""WELL YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME BEFOREHAND."" What the hell? I was so taken back by her response. The two tables beside us both told me that what she did was incredibly rude and suggested that I shouldn't tip her. One of the guys even said, ""I'm glad she wasn't our server.""

We had a party of 11 (cousins/relatives), we waited 45 minutes to sit on a Thursday night.... We were too hungry and tired so we didn't want to try other places since it was a struggle to find parking in this mall. Once we got seated, took them about 8 minutes to flag our waitress down since a lot of them said they didn't know who will be serving our table. After flagging our waitress it took another 10 minutes for her to bring us our water/drinks/bread. She brought us two trays of bread and one of the tray's bread was cold.... That ruined my appetite because I suppose that she just took it and didn't even bother to heat it up. We ordered pizzas, appetizers, pastas as usual but it took a while for them to bring out the appetizers before our entrees lol. We were a little disappointed but food was good so 3 stars~ Around $20 for a pasta dish that can feed at least 2-3 people is a deal.

I can't believe I'm writing a review in anger at 11 pm but it should not go unsaid. I called to place a Curbside order at appx 920 pm.  This was for the Valley Fair mall, Santa Clara location.  I was on hold for eleven minutes before someone answered.  I placed my order.   I arrived at the location immediately, they came out and I paid in cash.   Obviously it's the end of the dinner rush and Chzcake is a busy restaurant so I understood that it would take time for my order.  But 20 minutes passed.  Then 30.  Then 40.  Then 45.   47 minutes passed before I finally lost my patience and called in.  I told the hostess who answered the phone that I had been waiting over 45 minutes for my food.  She said she would get me to someone in bakery right away.  I was on hold for six minutes and no one picked up.   At this point, I was about to simply leave but realized that I had already paid.  And tipped!  I called back, the same hostess answered the phone and she told me she would get someone right away.  Someone at the bakery picked up and said they would bring the food right out. When I received the food, it was clearly evident that the pasta had been sitting for some time, as the food (which is covered inside of a box designed to stay hot) was slightly less than lukewarm.  I told the guy to just give me my money back. He went in and out came the manager.  Her name was Samantha Zaragoza (sp.?).  She handed me my cash.  Her words to me verbatim: ""Sir, your order tonight was $31, here's your cash-- did you need anything else tonight?""

zahra b.,"San Francisco, United States",287,54,2,1.0,1/8/2017,"Woah. I just had one of my worst restaurant experiences ever here. A few friends decided to come out together for their July 31 cheesecake special. We arrived at 8:30pm and were told the wait would be 60-75 minutes long. No problem. We were seated at approximately 9:30pm. We came for the cheesecake special! It was advertised on their website, signage, etc. So place our orders, with some for dine in, which we assume will be on the special and some to go, which we assume will be full price. However, the waitress tells us we need to order entres to get the cheesecake discount. Except that's not anywhere in the marketing or fine print. She insists it is. One of the girls had been there the night before and says she wasn't required to do the same last night. The waitress says it was a mistake. We ask about all of the other people who have been in line and are there as it doesn't appear they are all ordering entres. The waitress says some of the other staff may be unfamiliar with the rules and undercharging people. We ask her to check with her manager.  She does. Her narrative stays the same. Entres are required. The sign at the door says it. I go look at the sign. It matches what corporate has on the site. One per person. Dine in only. Nothing about a required entre. We ask to see the manager.  The manager comes out. He apologizes and says he understands we have been waiting and will give us the 1/2 price cheesecakes. We ask about the confusion and he explains the wait staff were asked to encourage people to order entres to minimize the lines.  What in the world? Encourage and require are two very different things. Not to mention the lying about the posters and other people's orders.  Ok. We're all set. Cheesecakes were ordered nearly 30 minutes ago, pricing issues have been cleared up, and maybe we will enjoy the rest of the night? No.  10 more minutes go by and we still don't have our cheesecakes. One of the girls asks the waitress. Oops.

I went with a party of 6, and we had to wait over an hour until we got seated. While it was really busy, it had died down quite a bit once we got to our table. Service was super slow and it took another hour after ordering before we saw any food. What really bothered us was they brought out our food at different intervals. Two people got their plates first, then another two plates arrived 15 minutes later, then the last two plates arrived about 10 minutes later. It really sucked, especially since we didn't start eating until everyone got their food. By then, some of our plates lost their heat. I ordered the almond crusted salmon salad and couldn't believe what they served me. The (small) piece of salmon looked and tasted old, and was definitely not crusted with almonds. Instead, they squirted a mayo sauce on top and sprinkled almond bits on top (which I couldn't eat, and scraped it off). The bottom of the salmon and edges were super dry too and did not look fit for eating. I don't understand why people like this place so much. It's overpriced, slow and poor quality.

The annoying thing was that they didn't have enough buzzers so I would just have to stand around and constantly check in with the host.  My boyfriend and I were seated about 10 minutes before the party next to us. Our server came over shortly after and took the drink orders for both tables. She came back 5 minutes later with drinks for the other table and took their order. Another 10 minutes pass before she finally comes back with my glass of wine and take our order. (She didn't bring my bf's drink for another 10 minutes after mine but to be fair it was a cocktail). Annoying since we were seated first and my drink order was not even complicated. Not to mention she forgot our waters and I had to ask another server for it halfway through our meal.  We decided to order the nachos to share and it was huge! We barely made a dent in it! My bf had the steak dianne and I had the pasta da vincii. When my pasta arrived, the penne was so hard! I told the server and she said that their pasta is served al dente. I've dined at cheesecake factory before and other Italian restaurants and my order was not al dente, it was hard!. I decided to let it slide since the they were busy and she did offer to have the kitchen remake it. 15 minutes later, and I get my pasta back and it is the exact same texture. Not sure if she just gave me back the same plate but whatever I had two bites of it and decided to just take it to-go along with the nachos since I was practically full from eating off my bf's plate.   When I got home, I opened up the box of nachos and a cockroach crawls out! GROSS. It couldn't have gotten into the box while it was closed so it must have been when the server was boxing it up for us. I am so grossed out that I tossed my barely eaten pasta as well in fear of there being little critters in there. Such a waste of a meal.

Call again and again, called 4 times. NOTHING. SO I get out go in tell them my name, I pay. The kid at the register says, ""so sorry gonna be another 15-20mins"" ummmm what?? Says they're slammed etc etc...  FINE wait my 20 mins.  Come back in. Is my order ready? No. He runs to the back says ""so sorry, they're finishing up your sweet potato fries, another 5-10 mins"" ARE YOU @)$&%# me?! So now it's been 30 mins longer than your person on the phone said and they can't even do fries quickly?! This is crazy.  FINALLY I get my order. All the does is keep saying sorry and doesn't offer a way to make it better.   1) never over promise and under deliver. That's just customer service 101. Be real with your time table. I would have been happier if you told me an hr wait from the get go 2)empower your staff to be able to make a situation better.  Offer free beverage, discount for next time, free piece of basic cheesecake. OR at the min teach them to bring a manager to apologize for the situation.  3)when you do finally give the food. AND it's 30mins late.  Maaaayyyyyybe make sure everything looks presentable (see pics).

Precious Ethel P.,"San Diego, United States",920,184,317,3.0,14/1/2016,"Most of the time, especially during the evening and the weekends, they are super busy and the wait is at least 30-45 minutes.  This is a huge restaurant but their food is pretty good and affordable so its understandable.  They also have great service, of all the many times I've eaten here, not once have I've experienced anything negative. I know a lot of people come here for their Cheesecakes, obviously, but I guess I'm not really a cheesecake person since I think that their cheesecake is just alright?  They have many different flavors that you can't really find anywhere else though so that's the plus and I guess that makes their cheesecake all that much better.   What I love about this location is that since there is such a long wait, they are connected to ValleyFair Mall, so, might as well shop while you wait?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=140

Mary Y.,"Los Angeles, United States",96,19,28,1.0,28/1/2017,"By far the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Took my nieces and nephews there for early dinner. The parking lot was a mess and traffic was terrible. Got in by 5:10 PM. Waited 20 minutes to be seated. It was crowded but not too bad. Even the staff leading us to our seat said it's not as busy. We sat for a good 10 minutes and no one comes by. I remain patient then decided to ask for assistance. Someone finally brings water to us and apologized as they ran out of glass and he handed us to-go cups. Okay...understandable. We wait another 10mins and the kids get a bit antsy and hungry. I finally grabbed another waiter. Not happy at this point and asked if we could order as it's been well over 20 minutes. He apologized and investigated what happened. Of course it took another 5 mins and finally our waiter came around. Took our orders and said would bring bread. I asked for more water. Of course, 10 mins go by and no water. I grabbed another staff walking by and asked (still very politely) for more water. Anyways, you know how the story goes. Good came out late too. My nephews kid menu had fries with it but it never came out until my third request (literally). Of course our waiter had disappeared at this point and a manager came over to refill our waters. I immediately asked for our check. I was furious at this point and forgot about dessert until he asked. I ordered cheesecakes to go and we left.  We will never return to this place again!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=140
Quyen L.,"San Jose, United States",654,439,1653,2.0,13/12/2015,"Long waits, giant portions, ASTRONOMICAL CALORIE COUNT, not the best descriptions for any restaurant, but unfortunately those fit the bill when describing the Cheesecake Factory. Located next to Westfield Valley Fair on Steven's Creek Boulevard, there is no denying that this is a lucrative establishment. Even at 8:30 pm on a Sunday night, there was still a 15 minute wait to grab a table at a place that must have HUNDREDS of seats. My sister, her husband, and I were too lazy to go anywhere far from the mall and since it had been over a year since I ate at the Cheesecake Factory, we thought it would be a good idea for dinner. If only we knew better... Appearance wise, the decor is great. Low, mood lighting, beautiful artwork on the ceilings and walls, marbled floors and columns are just a few of the intricate designs you will find in the restaurant. It is certainly a good place to take a date or your friends and family for a classier dinner, if all you're looking for is ambiance.  Our waitress for the night was friendly enough, but she seemed incredibly scattered. My sister had ordered a glass of Moscato and she failed to bring her the beverage at least 15 minutes after she had ordered it. When we needed her help, she was nowhere to be found and we had to wait for a good ten minutes before she finally came back. She was clearly a nice person, but as a waitress, left more to be desired. For our entrees, my sister ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta (extra spicy), my brother-in-law got the white chicken chili with white rice, and I chose the cajun jambalaya pasta.  When I read the description for my entree, I was super excited to dig into a dish that boasted spicy flavors, crunchy bell peppers, juicy chicken, and succulent shrimp on a bed of linguine pasta. What I got was a dish that lacked any sort of spice, aside from the aroma from the bell peppers, and linguine that was horribly bland. How can any entree called CAJUN JAMBALAYA be bland? Is that even possible? I couldn't believe how boring everything tasted!  My brother-in-law's dish looked like it was missing half of its portion, although if it was just going to be more of the hard, stale rice, I think he would say it wasn't much of a loss. My sister's pasta was definitely not spicy, let alone the extra spicy she had requested, and lacked a good amount of sauce as well.  Honestly, the only redeeming quality here was the house wheat bread, but even its warm, soft goodness couldn't save this train wreck of a meal. At the price we paid, we definitely felt like we were ripped off. It was obvious that the cooks didn't put much thought into their dishes tonight. Was it because it was so late on a Sunday evening? Perhaps, but regardless of the time, we were still paying customers who were looking to enjoy a pleasant dinner. It had been almost two years since the last time I've been back to the Cheesecake Factory. Clearly, I should have stayed away longer.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=140

The manager apologized for the mix-up and took the appetizer off our bill. The Ahi salad and chipotle pasta again were amazing.

I'm the kind of girl who's straight forward and cannot tolerate bullshit; when I casually ask for fine scotch, they know what I'm talking about (most bartenders from other chain restaurants often provide miss information). I find it very enjoyable to have a nice fine scotch and dinner here at the bar; If the bar takes a 45-min wait versus table, take the bar any day.

It was a little warm, to say the least... my mashed potatoes were cold and a little stiff, i got the salmon and steak factory combo, the salmon was good, moist, and my steak because it wasnt brought out right away, it was chewy and wasnt that great.

I love that they have a huge menu with over two hundred items to choose from. Even so, I always go with their Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. It is my absolute favorite dish of all time! Some of my other favorite dishes when I can get past my craving for the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta are: Pasta da Vinci, Louisiana Pasta, Chicken Madeira, Chicken Piccata, Miso Salmon, etc. These are certain items on the menu that you have to try! Not to mention, they have very generous portions, especially for dinner.  Also, they have a great selection of Cheesecakes and they are displayed very nicely at the Bakery. I love their Original and Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. This says a lot because I'm not even a Cheesecake person, yet I'll only eat Cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory!  Anyways, my last experience there was on a Friday night last week. My friend and I sat at the bar and was helped by two very sweet bartenders: Jimmy and Justin. They were both very nice, attentive, accommodating and patient with us. Anyways, I only ordered some sliders this time since I mainly came here for drinks. But I need to mention that their sliders were only decent. However, their drinks are good, especially the Strawberry Daiquiri! It is delicious; and remember, you have to ask them to put whip cream on if you like whip cream with your Strawberry Daiquiri. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!

Jennifer D.,"Felton, United States",1,5,,2.0,15/5/2017,"If you would have asked me before last night to rate this restaurant, I would have given it 4-5 stars. My family and I usually come here about once a month with a fairly large group, around 7-9 people, and have never really had any issues until now.  We came here last night for Mothers day dinner. It was busy when we arrived, but not overly so. Wait time was about an hour, which was fine because we knew there would be a wait on a holiday and we were able to kill time in the mall before heading to dinner. The problems started after we ordered our food. We were visited by two different managers at our table before our food even showed up to apologize for the wait, which we thought was odd since we didn't feel the wait was excessive at that point. It just seemed average for a weekend dinner here. When the food arrived at our table, one of the entrees was wrong. We promptly notified the person who brought the food out to the table (who wasn't our server) and they said they would fix it right away. Fair enough. Our server then came to the table, apologized for the mix up and said the correct entree would be out in about 5-7 minutes.  We waited another couple of minutes and the ""new"" entree comes out to the table. The supposed ""new"" entree ended up being the exact same plate of food they had sent out earlier, which was wrong. We told them again that it was wrong, they apologized again, and again they said they would correct it. At this point, one person at our table still did not have their food, Our waitress seemed to have disappeared and the correct entree still had not been brought out yet. We waited about 15 minutes and tried to flag someone down to figure out what was going on. You would think that it would have been easy to flag down a manager since two of them had already been to our table, but they were nowhere to be found at that point. Neither was our waitress. We ended up flagging down a server from another table and asked to speak with a manager. At this point a third manager comes out. I believe his name was Justin. We explain what was going on. At this point, those of us who got our food were pretty much done eating and the corrected entree never came out. He apologized and offered us a couple free deserts. We reluctantly agreed. Several minutes later and no server had taken our dessert order. We finally found out from the manager that he had switched our server without telling us, since he thought that we had an issue with the first one. It wasn't really her that was the issue, it was the kitchen staff, but ok. If you are going to give us another server, why wouldn't you tell us so we know who is going to be taking our order? At this point we were fed up and one of us was still hungry since he never received his correct food. They offered to box it up for us to go, but we were just so frustrated at this point that we wanted nothing more to do with this restaurant. We decided to skip dessert, which I had been looking forward to all day. It surprises me that on such a busy day with so many ""managers"" floating around the restaurant that our service was so terrible. It pretty much ruined our Mother's Day dinner and left me not wanting to come back. Which is sad, since we've had good service here before.

(Grace) I mean she apologized but it was the most unapologetic apology I've ever heard..  Anyways so we got a new server whose name I wasn't able to get but she was amazing ! Hence the two stars or else I would have gave just one.  In the end the manager did try to get on our good side by giving the birthday girl a free cheesecake  Great food but horrible service I doubt I'll ever return to this cheesecake again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=160
Preeti J.,"San Jose, United States",18,41,155,4.0,17/9/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a place of fine elegance & dining. Ambience is good & even with adequate seating arrangements the wait timings are long especially on weekends. Service & hygiene could be improved a bit for bettering the place. Pricey for certain but yet again the portion size of food served is great. Food- Being vegetarians shouldn't deter one to not visit this eatery,the options are good.  We ordered a fresh basil, tomato & cheese flatbread from the Skinnylicious - Small plates & Appetizers section. It was spot-on! The bread baked to perfection- soft n fresh & the harmony of basil -tomato with the melted cheese was simply great! Next was a Veggie Burger from the Glamburger & Sandwitches section. A Delicious ""Burger"" Made with Brown Rice, Farro, Mushrooms, Black Beans and Onion. Served on a Toasted Wheat Brioche Bun with Melted Fontina Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles and Mayo this was one whole some meal! Though the brown rice patty was dry n didn't much stick as one the flavors were good. Bread was soft n toasted well. We shared a burger n still felt very full. One cannot leave the place without tasting  its signature cheesecakes. My order was for a Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake. It was divine!!!!  An absolute sweet tooth lovers haven. Sweet to the palate, but contagious to not put back your spoon to dig in for another bite. The hazelnut flavor was very well dominant n so the crunch. Creamy n soft was the Cheesecake.To reduce the overpowering sweetness the whipped cream acted as a great accompaniment. By the end of all every bite was sinfully amazing.  With ample choices for every course of food the Cheesecake Factory is a great place for classic dining.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=100
Robert S.,"Palm Desert, United States",2,1,,1.0,1/1/2018,The Cheesecake Factory at Valley Fair has been disappointing on our last few visits eating there. I can only say is I'm not going back.

Vivienne C.,"Fremont, United States",157,122,171,4.0,11/7/2017,"I mean it's Cheesecake Factory. It has a standard haha. I came with a huge group around 5:30 on a Saturday night with a reservation and we still got seated awhile later. The food service was pretty slow around 45 minutes, but it's great for social events. The food is okay, but here are some of the food we ordered. 1. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - The pasta was pretty good, with a mixture of green (basil?) noodles and orange (tomato?) noodles. I was kind of disappointed that the only meat there was, was chicken and shrimp, which does not make it a jambalaya. Strong Cajun flavor, but literally there was no sauce. Kind of disappointed. 2. Eggplant Parmesan - The eggplant was so oily. After we finished eating 2 (out of 3), the whole plate was drenched. The top is very crispy, not a lot of Parmesan flavor, but the bottom was so oily, it was low-key disgusting. The pesto pasta was really good though.  3. Miso Salmon - DAMN this is actually really good. I love the outer crust flavor, a little bit sweet with Asian flair. Also the rice really matches the dish, because it's so easy to eat. Honestly they do Asian pretty good haha. 4. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta - Okay, I now understand the hype of this dish. It is actually pretty good because how many different kinds of ingredients there were in it. However, I feel like it was extremely salty, with the olives and the artichokes, the salt content was just too high. 5. Original Cheescake - Creamiest cheescake ever. It actually tasted pretty good, super silky and mesmerizing. I kind of forgot how it taste because yes, it's good, but it's not extremely memorable. 6. Tiramisu Cheesecake - This actually tastes like a tiramisu + cheescake combined. I don't know if this is the best combination, because coffee and cheese is kind of questionable together. Nevertheless, it is still really good. Overall, 3 for the food, but +1 for the bread. Okay the sourdough isn't really a sourdough, but the wheat bread was actually super delicious. I can totally eat that for the rest of my life.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=100

Emily L.,"Santa Clara, United States",84,244,267,4.0,18/3/2017,"No fights during Cheesecake this visit! The progression of the meal: 1. Bread - The table bread is something I could've done without. It's on the house but nothing too special so I wouldn't fill up on it. 2. Firecracker Salmon - Kind of a cool twist on firecracker shrimp. It's a long, skinny piece of salmon wrapped in a thin won ton wrapper. Only the sauce has some hint of ""spice"" in the most literal sense of the word, so you don't have to be worried about any explosions. There's a refreshing red cabbage slaw that's tossed lightly with some light dressing on the side. It was a tasty dish and a nice change from any old spring roll. 3. Bistro Shrimp Pasta - This was on the menu at a whopping 2100 calories. Fried shrimp, garlic cream sauce...mmm it was worth every single calorie. It's an enormous portion which is what must account for part of its delicious unhealthiness. 4. Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake - I swear they make you wait for your table so you have to ogle all the cheesecakes in all their glory in the front. There's no way you can say no to dessert after looking in the display case. If you enjoy Ferrero Rochers, you would love this cheesecake. The Nutella is a nice addition but even just the cheesecake is great. Note that this location is on the Winchester side of the mall. It's also not accessible from inside the mall so you do have to exit through Macy's to get to it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=100

Marie and CJ (training) were our servers. Everything was fine, but nothing was outstanding. The birthday girl had Thai Lettuce Wraps and I had the Chicken Madeira & Shrimp Scampi combo. It was strange; the shrimp seemed like they were coated and fried. I don't remember them being cooked like that before. I don't think I'll be getting that again.  We ordered cheesecake to go so we could share with my friend's family at home. We took a Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch and Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.

A line of 6 people waiting while 8 Employees are standing around behind the counter talking and watching the transaction taking place on one of the two registers. I get it, retail is busy! The manager was assisting a transaction with gift cards that was about a $600 purchase with multiple gift cards being loaded! Understandable. But The girl on the second register was talking with employees and didn't acknowledge the line of people waiting behind the first register until the manager directed people to the other line. Didn't seem like the second register was open since the girl was too busy talking with other employees. Multiple employees made eye contact with me and made no effort to assist me even though they were all doing NOTHING. Finally a man asked me if I needed help. Then the lady who I assume was the manager on duty gives me attitude because I mentioned it. All of a sudden once the manager says that the girl on the other register was open I was so irritated.

Brandon Y.,"San Jose, United States",827,615,1134,2.0,17/2/2017,"Sooo probably not the best place to go on a holiday... Even before arriving here, the parking lot was packed, and the construction makes it really confusing as to where there may be open spots (unless you want to pay for valet). Some family friends and I went to this spot for dinner for four on a Tuesday evening, and the wait was quite long. Apparently they'll only take reservations if your party is over a certain number. After 40-ish minutes, we were seated. I stayed rather basic and got the most popular Chicken Madeira, while those around me ordered Bang Bang Thai Dish, jambalaya, and a mango salad. Forty five minutes in, our server told us that someone had dropped the Bang Bang, so they're scurrying to make another one. The other dishes came first, and they were of decent proportion, and my chicken madeira was better than I've had before (usually it's rather dry). The jambalaya looked like it had been sitting out a bit because the noodles were stuck together. The mango salad was huge and delicious though. The Bang Bang they to-go'ed for us since we opted for cheesecake - nutella hazelnut and red velvet. Honestly, I think the cakes are a bit overpriced and overly sweet. I typically go for a little bit lighter on the sweets but keep the richness of the cheese. By the time we got out, we had spent 3 hours in that restaurant despite the kind waiter letting us know how crazy it was and apologizing profusely for everything (we did end up getting one of the cheesecakes for free). As we were leaving, still a ridiculous line with people looking tired for having waited...

We finally ordered, and our food took 45 minutes to come out. We were anticipating our food, and kept looking around for our waitress, only to see that people sitting around us that had arrived later on got their food before we did. Our waitress passed by and I asked if she could check on our food. Right after she left she came back with our food.  Everything was good, but it definitely was not worth the wait. We asked for boxes once we were full, and that also took about 20 minutes for our waitress to bring out. We wanted to leave and go to the mall after, so we asked another waiter to give us boxes.

When I come to Cheesecake Factory, I never care how much I eat and i never watch my calorie intake when I dine here because i know everything is going to be so good!! Food - (my favorites) -   The complimentary sourdough and honeywheat bread is always good. I love the honeywheat bread but I always make sure not to eat too much so I have room for my meal and dessert. Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta: My favorite pasta dish!! The sauce is amazing with the kick of spicyness. Govida chocolate cake - Make with no flour!! It is not too bitter and not overly sweet. Service - Despite how popular Cheesecake factory is and the long line of people waiting for their table, I am surprised that the wait for a party of 2-4 is usually less than a 30 minute wait. Even if it was 1 hour long, I might still be willing to wait for a table. Staff is always friendly and makes sure you are satifsifed with your meal. I came to this locations serveral times. Food and service is very consistent. One time, a waiter accidentally dropped a lady's dish and scared everyone around with a loud bang. He took is very professionally and gave her a new dish that came out 5 mins later and offered her sparkling water/soda to calm her down.

Chaz C.,"Santa Clara, United States",5,13,1,2.0,30/5/2017,We went to the this location for my birthday dinner. I mentioned that it was my birthday and the waiter acknowledged. When ordering our food we asked if our food could come out with the appetizers and not to wait for the appetizers to come out and then do the food he must have forgot that because our food came out a while after the appetizers were finished. The waiter was a little forgetful. When my wife entree came which was salmon with broccoli the broccoli had yellow flowers on it and there was brown spots also. We asked to see the manager and Jason came. He tried to explain that the broccoli was just fine and I showed him and told him that the the broccoli had brown spots he told me no it's yellow and I said no sir it is not yellow it's over right and it has lost a lot of it nutrients. He offered to go back to the kitchen and have some new broccoli made up that was more presentable when it came out it was overcooked and it still had brown spots on it. He also told me that they accepted the order of overripe broccoli.  The next issue which is a little more disconcerting is that during my meal I had fruit flies flying around our booth first there was just one and then by the end of the meal there was 4 of them flying around the window and then there was a dead one on the windowsill. Kind of makes you wonder how clean the restaurant is when they have fruit flies flying around. Oh and to top it all off they forgot my birthday oh well at least my hamburger was okay and my son like this spaghetti but we will probably not be visiting that location again because of the fruit flies and the lack of compassion from the manager Jason 5/31 Corporate called me and they were very nice apologetic.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=120

With my most recent visit, I'll have to part ways with you. Service took forever, I couldn't even flag anyone because there was no one to flag down.  My complimentary bread was cooled down from being out for sometime. The entrees itself, was just so sad. My steak Diane and herb crusted salmon combo was bland and warm. Not even hot. My sister's shrimp scampi was bland and wimpy looking. The Cajun pasta was bland, not enough sauce and warm. Only the Luau salad was good considering there wasn't much work put into the salad.

Vanesa R.,"San Jose, United States",41,2,,1.0,24/9/2017,"We have gone to the Cheesecake Factory plenty of times, but this terrible experience has definitely made us reconsider ever going back. We got there at 6:50 We were amazed on how fast we got a table, but unfortunately that was the only positive thing to happen to us. After sitting for a while with out a waiter acknowledging us we had to ask for someone to helps us. We let it slide thinking it was busy for staff. We finally place our order, and I take a call at 7:20. The table next to was having a difficult time with their order; it was completely wrong and late. (We notice that the place was not as packed as we originally thought it was). 20-30 minutes later they settled and leave. By this point we ask about our food and for more bread (we are starving). They inform us it'll be out soon. Ok cool, we can deal with that.......15mins later, we check in again and we are informed that something is wrong in the kitchen so are food will be longer now, and they just walk way. They didn't ask if we wanted anymore bread or drinks. By this point we are not even hungry anymore the anger was filling our tummies. At some point the manager that had been helping the table next to us, walks up to us apologize for the delay. We calmly ask why it's taking so long, we have been sitting there waiting for our food for almost an hour. He tells us we have only been sitting for a few minutes and that he'll check when we placed our orders. He informed us that our order was only placed 30 minutes ago, it's 8:30pm!!! WTF happen to our order?!!! We paid for our drinks and walk out. We really don't care that we had to wait, we understand that something's take time and or that shit happens. But what we don't like is the bad customer service especially from a management member. Don't come over to apologize for a long wait and then say we weren't waiting that long.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=240

Robin H.,"San Francisco, United States",719,118,427,4.0,13/8/2016,"THE CAKE: I've had many fond memories dining at the Cheesecake Factory, mainly because the service of the staff and the quality of the dishes have been consistently excellent with every visit. My only qualms for dining @TCF is the lack of parking and long lines during peak hours (holidays and weekends), so give yourself some lead time before your meal. You'll be glad you did. THE CREAM: My TOP 10 favorites dishes: 1.  MISO SALMON_$20_Light and flakey grilled salmon in a complex sweet & savory sauce over white or brown rice (I prefer brown because it doesn't sponge up the sauce and is delightfully fun to chew). Despite its lack of veggies (the 5 snap peas are nearly raw, so I order a side salad), the sauce puts this dish on a league of its own.  2.  SKINNYLICIOUS TUSCAN CHICKEN_$17_Surprising juicy and well-seasoned chicken breasts, asparagus, cherry tomatoes in a warm & tart vinaigrette sauce. Chicken + veg = low-carb dish. 3.  BANG-BANG CHICKEN AND SHRIMP_$19_Smooth Thai coconut curry oozes with mix of exciting textures: crispy coconut flakes, juicy chicken, peanuts and vegetables served over fluffy rice. *FOOD COMA PORTION. 4. ORANGE CHICKEN_$17_Well-battered chicken takes a dip in a thick sweet/sour/savory sauce, stir-fried and served over rice. No veg. 5.  CRISPY CHICKEN COSTOLETTA_$18_Light-breaded chicken breast served w/ delightfully tart lemon sauce. Served w/ mash potatoes & asparagus. *FOOD COMA PORTION. 6.  LEMON HERB ROASTED CHICKEN_$18_For a classic comfort dinner, this hearty, well-seasoned roasted 1/2 chicken is served w/ zingy lemon sauce. Served w/ roast carrots and mash. *DINE+TAKE HOME PORTION. 7.  CHICKEN PARMESAN SANDWICH_$14_Nice balance of flavors and textures: golden breaded chicken and sweet bell peppers between two slices of cheesy rustic bread served w/ a side of marinara sauce to take this sandwich over the top. A bit heavy on butter, so I suggest a side of baby greens to add to the sandwich. *DINE+TAKE HOME PORTION.  8.  SMOKEHOUSE BBQ BURGER_$14_Burger crave? This one's sure to please. A well-seasoned beef patty is stacked with crispy bacon, cheddar, crispy onion strings, and frilly iceberg lettuce on a sweet fluffy bun. Served with creamy BBQ ranch sauce on side. I prefer baby greens over fries for less guilty meal.  9.  SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES_$11_Sweet & soft cakes w/ dynamic texture: sweet corn, course grain of corn meal in complex combination of savory sauces + the cooling effect of guac, sour cream and fresh pico de gallo salsa. Every inch of this dish is different and good to the last bite. Best when shared as it's too small to be a meal on its own. 10.  SEARED TATAKI SALAD_$19_Simple, but tasty salad w/ seared tuna and mixed baby greens, thick-sliced tomato and avo, and balsamic vinaigrette. *FAST AND LIGHT PORTION.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=240
Blanca H.,"Fremont, United States",0,15,,1.0,13/8/2016,"The food was pretty good, I always come for the cheesecake so that's never a disappointment... HOWEVER the service was shitty. My server was dull and kinda gave a face when we asked if we could move tables. I understand that asking to be moved sometimes can be a pain, but our plates were too big for the little ass table my BF and I got seated....In addition our server just wasn't giving much of a welcoming and overall good service. I felt like she was rushing and didn't even bother to offer us extra plates. I used to be a server myself so I get that if you're having a bad day you don't want to be serving especially giving full attention to your customers, but still. Sad thing is that one of the workers who wasn't a server was the one who was taking care of us..

Kathy M.,"San Jose, United States",228,24,67,4.0,28/4/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is the one I go to most since it's the closest to my house. I mostly come here with family but today I decided to come here with my boyfriend for their happy hour, which are weekdays from 4pm-6pm. The appetizers range from $5.50-$7 and the serving sizes are pretty big. Their draft beers are $4 and wines and well drinks are $5.50.  My boyfriend and I ended up ordering the fried zucchini, southern fried chicken sliders, and the crab wontons with two draft beers. When the food arrived, we were surprised at how big the portions were and became unsure if we could conquer it all. The fried zucchini was crispy and tasted delicious with the grated cheese sprinkled on top, dipped with ranch. The crispy crab wontons were also good and quite filling since it had cream cheese inside. The wontons came with a sweet chili sauce mix, which complemented the flavor of the wontons. Lastly, the southern fried chicken sliders were super delicious. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and soft, juicy meat on the inside. They put pickles, lettuce, and tomatoes on the side with two sauces. The sliders themselves were pretty big and came in four servings.  After finishing the last slider, we felt defeated and had to take the rest of the unfinished appetizers to go! I will definitely come back for their happy hour, but next time, order less food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=240

First of all, we waited our meal for 50 minutes. We got the drinks fast but there was no water offered. After 45 minutes of waiting, our server didn't check on us even once and we asked him what was going on since many tables his area of service was not busy. We tried to ask a server for help from another area but she said she would call for our server to help us. He returned with our dishes in 10 minutes... Finally , we politely asked where our water was and he brought it in 20 seconds when we were finishing our meal. Out of respect for this restaurant chain and just by being nice ,we still left good tips but I hope the management would read this review to its staff and train servers to follow up at clients' table, offer water, and follow up if there is long wait.

He immediately went and made sure and asked and brought it right away. My first time here but definitely not my best, also the food came pretty fast and it was better then what I expected, other people have bad experiences (according to the reviews) but maybe it's just a hit or miss. Thanks David for the experience. Today I came back and like always, didn't have to wait which was great since it was just two of us. I sat down and the waiter was very nice which is good since I've came here about 5 or 6 times and every time it's a hit, everything is spot on, I ordered a classic burger and when it came, it was spot on, cooked perfectly , while enjoying my meal, a guy walking around wearing a plaid polo shirt was going around making sure everything was right. He saw that my girlfriends and my soda was quite low so he offered to go refill it for us which was quite nice.

Laura T.,"Union City, United States",2,31,12,3.0,11/12/2016,"If you're planning to have dinner here, prepare to wait.  For a party of two our wait time was 45-50 mins.  When we arrived, there were people hanging out in front and in the lobby area waiting to be called and a line almost out the door just to leave their name on the waiting list.  On the upside, across the restaurant is a designated parking lot area just for the Cheesecake Factory.  It's not very large, but better to have than not. My usual is the Miso Salmon, it never disappoints, well at least it hasn't so far.  My husband's usual favorite is the Shrimp Scampi.  However, this time round he said it was a little overcooked. The staff was very friendly and they work really hard.  Yes, you have to wait sometimes to get their attention as they zip by passing your table. Rather than wait to order dessert we thought it would be faster to just go up to the take-out counter. Wrong!  There was a line for that as well. It wasn't too bad but after placing our order it's placed into the queue between desserts ordered for dine-in and take out.  It would have been faster if I went behind the counter and retrieved it myself.   The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Cheesecake was worth the wait.  Can't say the same for the Banana Cream Cheesecake.  The restaurant is family friendly and it's not a quiet restaurant.  So kids can talk loud, laugh or cry and adults near the bar area can watch sports and cheer on their team.

Main reason for coming here is for the avocado egg rolls! They are delectable little treats that are crispy, fresh, have great flavors/sauce. Each bite is pure bliss, yum. A lot of other restaurants try to copy cheesecake factories avocado eggrolls however no one makes it even close to cheesecake factory's! Definitely recommend the Pasta da Vinci. Tender pieces of chicken, different types of mushrooms, grilled onions with penne pasta in a creamy white sauce. It is a little heavy and greasy but I love the flavors of this pasta dish.  The miso salmon is delicious! Salmon was perfectly cooked, great miso flavoring on top of a bed of white or brown rice. This dish could use more veggies though, there was only 5-6 pieces of snow peas. Beautiful presentation though, this is a dish that tastes as great at it looks. Strawberry cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake and white raspberry cheesecakes are all delicious!  Service has always been great here. Portions are HUGE (even lunch portions). I always share entrees here to make sure I have enough room for cheesecake!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=220

He literally went around our table and did not even bother to check on us. Finally I called over the Manager to get some water. Then we waited 20 minutes to order cheesecake and the server never came. Once again I called the manager over and asked for our check. I was pissed I wanted cheesecake but I was not about to wait any longer there. The server ran our payments and there was a balance of 11.33 due. I put down cash and we left. Suddenly the server chased us out stopped my friends car and told her we owed the $11.33. My friend told the server to check because we put cash down. The server told her not to drive away as he ran in to check, sure enough the money was there. I am beyond upset with the professionalism and aloofness of the server and establishment.

Brian B.,"Livermore, United States",588,1091,123,2.0,12/11/2015,"The promise of TCF is always better than the reality. It feels like a 3 star place but I can't give it 3 and look at that ""A-OK"" tagline when it's a ""Meh"" experience. This location always has a wait because it's popular. No crime there. You put your name on the list and sit in the lobby area the size of the capitol rotunda. There are no soft surfaces and the tiny voice of the hostess is no match for the din. It's an annoying way to start the night and it's easily fixable.  The voluminous menu is overly confusing and includes advertising including one ad for an online service helping the friendless. Not a dating site. Just a site helping lonely people find other lonely people to become friends with. Festive, right?  The food seems overly fussy, a little bland and arrived just a tad on the cool side. We had no napkins and in asking for them were told that our server should have provided them. So now we have no napkins and feel like we've gotten our cheerful server in trouble. ""I can take care of that"" would have been a better response since I have zero interest in the inner workings of the processes and procedures at TCF.  The wine list could be MUCH better. Particularly the by-the-glass list. My malbec showed up slightly oxidized and tired but after the napkin moment, I frankly wasn't looking for interaction with the staff. It wasn't terrible. It's never terrible here. It's just ""meh.""

Molly M.,"North San Jose, San Jose, United States",2,19,2,1.0,18/1/2017,"We excitedly got together to celebrate 2 birthdays (group of 5) and we were disappointed from the time we came in. We were promised a 15min wait, however we had to wait 55min. Many guests who came after us, groups of 3,4,6,and 7, were seated before us. I kept asking, the manager kept telling me the same- we don't have tables for you.  So finally, we get seated, and I've never been so offended in any restaurant- our server was very dismissive, rude and not helpful at all. I asked him if he can replinish our bread basket, because we were very hungry, after waiting for a table for so long, he responded ""just wait, I can't help you now, I have other tables."" He was scolding me. I have never had this experience before. He was never available for any of our needs, so I decided to ask other servers who were passing by for our dessert, an extra orange juice drink, the receipt, and  to go boxes. Other servers were extremely pleasant and I appreciated their help. I would also mention to them that the server is no where to be found and he doesn't seem to want to serve us. They would apologize and would serve us right away.  To say the least, it was a horrible experience. I will never go back to the Valley Fair location. And I will tell all my friends and family to avoid that location as well. I spent $150 that evening and I tipped him 15%-  didn't want to because he didn't deserve the tip.  The manager was unprofessional and unhelpful, I did not want to deal with her as well. Because I asked so many times as to when our table will be ready, she offered a cheesecake slice on the house, when my bill came, I paid for all 5 cheesecakes- and I wasn't going to even try to get a slice free- I ran out of there as fast as I could.

I shared mine with my friend and let me tell you that the Louisiana pasta was amazing! Their servings here were definitely big so expect big portions. Luckily, we shared because if we didn't, I would've never finished it. There were a couple of things that I didn't like. First, the very dim lighting. I understand that the ambiance they're trying to portray was intimate, but it was literally Abercrombie & Fitch version of a restaurant. Another thing was the slow service. At the beginning, it seemed fine, but towards the end, our server seemed MIA. A contributing factor could've been our servers switching shifts. Would I come back here? Yes!

I ordered a cheesecake and mistakenly didn't know that a whole cake came in different sizes. The waitress charges me the most expensive $55.00 cake and didn't ask what size I wanted upon taking my order. I understand that I should have checked that, but as a waitress I would have expected her to ask ""what size would you like?"" Instead of charging me for the most expensive cake.

Jonathan T.,"Cupertino, United States",400,403,410,4.0,22/5/2015,"Woot cheesecake factory! Your go to entry level fancy chain restaurant. Perfect for when you want to go for a nice dinner on a budget.  This location does not take reservations, at least it didn't when I tried to make one on the Saturday of Mother's Day. The wait is long, and they don't tell you accurate wait times. If the wait is actually an hour, they'll tell you half an hour. Just watch out for that and be prepared to wait longer than what you expect.  They give you a buzzer that alerts you at limited range so go shop around Valley Fair and come back when it's almost your turn to be called.  Excellent Service - Friendly, attentive, and polite waitstaff.  Portobello Mushroom, Avocado, Zuchini small plate - These are all deep fried and served with this chipotle style cream based sauce. It's delicious.  It came out very crispy and with a lot of batter, more than I prefer for my taste but that's what makes it come out crunchy. The portion is just enough for a party of 4 to each try a mushroom, avocado, and zucchini piece.  Vietnamese summer shrimp spring roll - Sweet and fragrant. This is not your typical Vietnamese springroll! The ingredients are not your typical bean sprouts and basal. They're stuffed with thick plump shrimp and various veggies that have been pickled and/or marinated. The flavors work very well together. It comes with 2 types of sauces! One is the typical peanut based dipping sauce, and other is a sweeter, teriyaki style sauce.  We chose to order these apps because everything else on the menu was a lot of fried/creamy/fatty stuff. Yes the mushroom/avocado/zucchini platter was fried, but at least there's some veggie based foods in there. I guess this just shows how limited your options are when you're going for something 'healthier'. Hibachi steak - the steak was delicious, as expected. You can't really go wrong with steak aside from not seasoning it properly and not getting the right cook on it. It came out to a good medium well, and was still moist and juicy on the inside. This dish was served with garlic red mashed potatoes with a hint of wasabi over the top! Soo good.  Turkey burger - I ordered this with sweet potato fries. As with all turkey burgers, the meat patty is gonna come out dry, nothing you can really do about it, and that's kinda the point of ordering a less fattening/healthier burger. The turkey was still seasoned well. I've had a lot better burgers elsewhere so it would be fair for me to say I'm disappointed in their burgers.  You cannot leave cheesecake factory without ordering their cheesecake! 30th anniversary cheesecake - It's basically a mix of chocolate and vanilla. Absolutely delicious. Thick, rich, creamy, and it just melts in your mouth. The cake portions are soft and moist, and complements the cream cheese area of the cake. You'd expect each slice to come out to over $10, but it's really more like $7-8 per slice.

Annie N.,"Fremont, United States",30,30,25,3.0,1/7/2017,My bf and I dined here around 2/3 pm on a Friday. It wasn't that busy and we had a 10/15 wait before we were seated. That was fine. Food was good aside from the fact our order got mixed up in the takeout line and we pushed back. We ended up waiting for like 40 minutes for our food even though our server kept saying it'll be just a few minutes. I'd say it's one of my pet peeves when people over promise and under deliver so I was annoyed. I've never had an experience like this at any Cheesecake Factory and I like the food there so hopefully it was just one incident.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=200

Something happened with our order so my bfs dish came out but we still didn't receive the appetizer or my dish. We decided to cancel the appetizer which wasn't a problem. I had a number of waiters probably like 3 total apologizing for the mishap which I totally appreciate. I don't remember their names(wish I did!) but I do remember that the manager, Samantha, came to apologize as well. Got a free cheesecake on the house!

The ambiance is nice - it's almost like a maze. I almost ended up in the kitchen like three times.. haha. But the ambiance IS enlightening! I ordered the Da Vinci Pasta, and wowzahs! The flavors were bouncing all over! It was quite the delicious meal!~ I would definitely order it again. I'm actually craving for it right now as I type.  The experience was great yesterday, and IT WAS ALL THANKS TO OUR SERVER CATHY. Thank youuu Cathy!!!

They put the salad on the bottom on the bag and so my salad was cooking. Gross. If I wanted a warm meal, I would have ordered something hot, but I ordered a salad and it was so warm. This was my mom's dinner. Horrible!  Eggplant Parmesan: pasta was so dry. It was all stuck to eat other. I was able to pick up the clump of pasta with a small fork. It was so hard.

I came to have a very relaxing time here with a coworker of mine. We were seated relatively quickly since we got there before the dinner rush.  Once we were seated the waitress came to our table and took our drinks order. We also requested bread at that time. It took like 20 minutes to get bread. We actually got our appetizers before we got the bread. After a while we got our order in. We got our food and started to eat. Here is where things start going south. The waitress came to our table, I kid you not, about 10 times asking if we were ready for boxes. She actually reached to take my coworker plate and silverware before she was even done eating. We were also ordering a to go order but we told her that we were going to order it right before we left because we didn't want it to be cold and we were going to be there a while. We hadn't even gotten our dessert yet when she comes out with our to go order. She literally said ""I took it upon myself to place your to go order because I thought the kitchen was going to take longer"". We specifically told her we had no rush in leaving as we were trying to enjoy our cocktails and dessert after work.  After we received our to go order, it clicked for us that she was going to be off which is why she was rushing us. We remembered her telling us when she took our drink order that it was ""home stretch"" meaning she was close to being done with her shift. I understand everyone wants their tips but if you are rushing me I'm not even going to give a tip. Honestly, if you have to clock out, give your damn table to another server so my service won't suck.

The nice young man a the front desk said it would be 20-25 minutes, said we could try the bar. The bar was full but got a table within ten minutes. We waited at the table another ten minutes before it got cleared. Jamie T. Was our server (young Asian influenced lady). She took our Oder within another five minutes. We then got buzzed five minutes after that for a table but told the hostess me would just stay as we had already ordered food. We ordered crab bites, Asian lettuce cups and the Thai lettuce wraps. Plus my fiancé ordered a black tea. Our server brought the crab bite, which were smaller than in past visits to dine here. But taste was spot on. The Asian wraps were next, larger with overall ingredients than in previous visits but the amount of chicken (main protein here) was very lacking. My fiancée Thai lettuce cups came and again of the small side with the amount of chicken compared to what we normally would get. Our server however seemed to be more inclined to talk with her friends than to pay any attention to us. I went the entire meal without being able to get a refill on my water and she never brought us my fiancée tea. Which was a big surprise when we got the bill and it was still in there. We asked that she remove the cost of the tea because we didn't receive it. She just shrugged her shoulders as if to say O Well. Did not even bother to apologize or show any kind of concern.

There was a wait, which for the time and day wasn't a shock nor a big deal. However the food and service was the worst we had ever had in our lives. To top it off both my girlfriend and her mother have been or are waitresses so they know their way around a restaurant. The waiter didn't know the menu, that's to say he didn't kow the size of their pizzas or if something came on the sandwich. They also spilled a full glass of water across my girlfriends mom and then just left the table, booth, and her soaking wet. It also bothered her that the waiter kept say hi guys or what do you guys need or sure guy I'll get that in right now, when short of myself she and my girlfriend are obviously women. The food was bland, flavorless, and the pizza was a salt lick. To top that off the cheese they shred onto your food was kept across from us in a rag on the server station. Then someone put a tray with dirty dishes on it and the it jus kept piling up and was eventually taken to another table to be used. They also took a fork off of the dirty dish tray and gave it to my girlfriends mom when she asked for a fork later. I had to stop her and gave her the one I wasn't using. I will never go to this location again and honestly may never return to the cheesecake factory at all. I wouldn't recommend it after this experience because there obviously isn't any love or passion in this place and if we are going to spend our hard earned money on food the it should be good and the service should compliment it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=280
Jodi H.,"Silicon Valley, United States",290,812,1283,2.0,7/9/2014,"I've gotta say...Cheesecake Factory has gone dooooownhill in the past couple of years. I went back a couple of days ago with my family, and we haven't been in a couple of years...and back then we LOVED TCF. Maybe it was because I was still a kid back then and totally loved the glitz and glamor of the beautiful large space...but the quality of the food, service, and ambiance have completely changed for the worse. Located in the prime space of Valley Fair shopping center, EVERYBODY I know has been to this TCF location. With that being said, you're always going to have a wait whether it's 5 minutes or over a solid hour. The place is GRAND and gorgeous with their European-painted ceilings and royal setup and white-clad servers. However, the place felt so empty and the AC was turned up way too high on the weekday night that I was there. A few years ago, TCF was always bustling with people out in front, and the place was packed with chattering and laughter, but we just didn't get that the night we ate here. Maybe it was because it was a strange weekday night, but who knows. We were served by Bridget, and she was polite and smiley, but only came around to check on us once in a while. We really enjoyed her going above and beyond to give us a sweet Happy Birthday ice cream, so thanks girl! As a server in the industry, I just wanted to comment on the unfortunate dress code policy! I felt so bad for the servers because they had to wear ALL WHITE (top and bottoms), so it was more obvious to see their stains and what not...but that's just me being a picky observer. In terms of the food, it was a bit pricey for the portion size/quality. I had Evelyn's Favorite pasta...and it was WAYYYYYY TOO SALTY! My mom also had a pasta that was pesto of some sort, and we both agreed that we were just oversalted with our taste buds! The flavors were pretty yummy, but the pasta chef really needs to tone down the salt level. I wouldn't come back here in a while--too much has changed in the last couple of years, so it would take lots of convincing for anyone in my family to come back. There are better options across the street in Santana Row--so I highly recommend going there versus TCF here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=280

This answer was not completely wrong cause it does have chocolate but turned out also coconut and walnuts. There was nothing wrong with the cashier's answer but I really expect that she could be more responsive and have said something such as ""this cake is mostly coconut"" or ""only the brown layer is chocolate cake"".

We asked multiple times and were told 'just a few more minutes' , 'they're plating' and my personal favorite 'they're at the window waiting to be delivered'.  I know a busy restaurant such as this one things can get hectic and mistakes are made, but no one - not even the manager, apologized nor tried to compensate us for our grievance.

The waitress was also friendly and helpful to us. When the garlic noodles came, I started to eat. Since the server didn't ask if any of us wanted parmesan cheese, the waiter came by and noticed that and offered to grate us some cheese. So attentive! After getting cheese, we all started eating. The garlic noodles were pretty good in my opinion but I would've loved a stronger garlic flavor. As for the rest of the party, I've also took nibbles of each dish. There was some other pasta dishes and a tamale dish. All of which was pretty good. Having finished our meal, we ordered cheesecake.  We had the anniversary cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake. I liked the red velvet cheesecake way better. The anniversary cheesecake was a bit too chocolatey for me. If you LOVE chocolate, I think you'd like the anniversary cheesecake. They had both a cream cheese layer and a cake layer. I don't know how they do it, but it works and it's good. I liked it. My meal was complete and was enjoyable.

Mind you, we all arrived at 6:00PM. We were not seated until 8:45PM. We were a party of 13.

Service ranges from ""eek!"" to ""wow this person is amazing!"", with most of my experiences being good. Cheesecakes are a must, as this is THE cheesecake factory!

I order from here all the time and take my food Togo and I also dine in. Tonight was the straw that broke the camels back.  I placed my order at 9:30pm. Was asked if I want complimentary cutlery and bread. I obliged and said yes and I also requested ranch dressing. The server told me it would be about 20 min and the food will be ready.  I arrived at 10:15pm.. When I arrived the lady at the register was inputting her tips in the computer and asked me to wait for 10 minutes I waited like an idiot and now 55 minutes later and my order was still not ready. I asked for ranch because they forgot my ranch. Finally 5 minutes later ranch came out  I wanted to add banana cheesecake to my order they were out..  I wanted to add chocolate moose cheesecake to my order they were out..  I wanted to add carrot cake to my order they were out .. I wanted bread with my meal. Guess what they handed me a rock hard stale piece of bread and when I asked the cashier for some real bread. He went digging in other people's to-go bags until finally going to the kitchen and finding out there's no more bread!  At this point I have been at Cheesecake Factory for 40 min it's 10:55 and they are about to close. And the guy who helped me saw I was frustrated and annoyed and didn't offer any explanation but send an older Asian lady  over to tell me they had no bread.  By the time I got home finally and sat to eat food was cold and not edible. Ended up throwing all the food away.  Cheesecake Factory how can you run out of cheesecake??! It's your main product. This place should be called ""were out of Cheesecake Factory""  No one offered me a single discount and no one apologized for the crap service. I guess they don't care about their customers. I'll never be back again to this ""We're out of Cheesecake Factory"". Go to the actual ""Cheesecake Factory"" at Oakridge",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=320

I was initially planning to either (hopefully) cash it in to someone or just give it away, thinking there's no way I'd use it. I'm glad I did. We ordered the buffalo tenders appetizer to start, which is a little pricey at $9, but surprisingly yummy. Normally I don't really like spicy buffalo anything, but my boyfriend ordered it without prior knowledge of this, and the waiter swiftly put in the order before we could track him down to change our minds haha.  My boyfriend also ordered the Cheesecake Factory burger with cheese (I think?? Does this exist on the menu? lol) and I got the au jus sandwhich (I can't remember the name of this either). Both were really freaking good! We could only finish half our meal, so took the rest as leftovers for the next day. Even microwaved it was great :D I definitely have a change of heart for Cheesecake Factory now.

It's kind of embarrassing to be the one person who's constantly wrestling with their food, or having to casually set pieces of chewed gristle aside on the plate. I love french dip-style sandwiches, but this one was waaaaaaaaaaaay too salty.

Nathan N.,"San Jose, United States",264,127,170,4.0,8/5/2016,"I've come to the Cheesecake Factory a bunch of times over the past few years because it is always a solid option for dinner.  In terms of consistency with food, service, wait and atmosphere I would have to rate the Cheesecake Factory among one of the better restaurants.   Ambiance:  Very spacious environment with high ceilings and lots of room.  Definitely a very loud, fast paced and packed environment throughout the day making it one of the more fun places to dine at with a group.  Whether you are going as a party or a date, the Cheesecake Factory provides a fun and exciting environment to enjoy your meal in.   Food:  The menu here is super extensive with hundreds of options to choose from for meals, drinks and desserts.  I'm not lying when I said the most difficult thing is deciding what to eat and then trying to finish their massive portions.  My favorite options so far have been the: Pasta Da Vinci, Chipotle Chicken Pasta and Factory Meatloaf.   The pasta's are always cooked well with great ingredients and served as a massive portion.  The meatloaf is huge, cooked perfectly and topped with a very deep and beefy mushroom sauce.  Other good dishes I have had here are the stuffed mushrooms, burgers, chicken bellagio and their steaks.  Last but not least I can not forget about the delicious cheesecake options they have here.  Similar to their dinner menu, they have what seems like hundreds of cheesecake options which are all very delicious and rich.   My favorite one so far is the Red Velvet cheesecake and Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  Service: Service here is always very friendly and helpful.  Top notch servers with great knowledge of the menu and very helpful with any requests or questions you have.  Requests are taken care of quickly, water is always filled and you are checked on without being pestered too much throughout your meal. Overall Experience:  I recommend Cheesecake Factory to anyone looking for a solid option whether its brunch, lunch or dinner.  Great staff, great food and great ambiance make for a good meal every time I visit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=320

No one came to take our order for about 15 minutes. I had to ask one of the waiters to help us, they obliged and we finally gave our order.

After waiting for 10 more minutes we asked another waiter to help out; he said he would check the status of the order. He finally came back with some water but said they were out of bread and were preparing the next batch. While we were waiting for bread to arrive I saw every other table being served with bread and food. Despite mentioning that by daughter was hungry nothing was being done. After 1 hr 15 minutes we decided to leave as we never got bread or our drinks.  We let the receptionist know that we are leaving without having any food, she asked us to talk with the Manager. The manager intervened and mentioned that we don't have to pay for food; without even listening to what we complaining about. After letting the manager know that we had nothing to eat she said sorry and would be ok if we left.  This made my wife and me sad and angry. None of staff cared about a 22 month old leaving hungry without any food. I was angry that the Manager jumped to a conclusion saying that we don't have to pay for food even before listening to us.

After being seated, our server took our orders in a very impolite manner.  Also, we were missing 2 waters at one side of the table and was told she'd bring it but never did.  That was the same thing with adding cheese to the pasta my sister ordered and when asked for the cheese again, the server had the audacity to give attitude and say 'oh you wanted cheese?' In addition to that, my bf didn't even get the burger he ordered yet and said he'd have to wait a little longer then bc of the cheese. EXCUSE ME?? Really? Then she continued to roll her eyes and walk away.  It also got to the point where we had to ask and talk with the manager.

After letting out an obviously exaggerated sigh as if we were bothering him, he said yeah and walked away. To do what I'm not sure as there was no one waiting to be seated. After about 20 mins of waiting in line, we were greeted without even a smile or eye contact from the woman working the bakery register. I was so annoyed with the total looks of constipation and annoyance everyone in that established had that we just paid and left.  Once we got home, yet another disappointment.

Like others have mentioned, the menu is a bit overwhelming, but the lunch specials seemed decent. We ordered the Miso Salmon and the Salmon Genovese (both were the lunch special versions). The food came quickly. Be aware that the portions, even for the lunch specials, are large! We both ended up eating only half and packing the other half to-go. Both salmons were cooked well, and despite having a lot of sauce, neither were too salty. If you're debating between the two, the miso has a more subtle flavor that's a bit sweet while the genovese has stronger flavors that are more savory. The server was attentive and friendly, and the service overall was quick.  Be aware that the AC there is turned up high, so if you're sensitive to the cold, bring a jacket!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340
Wenting Z.,"San Jose, United States",25,107,185,2.0,30/3/2016,"Service is not good. We were waiting for a hour on a Wednesday evening, and I finally asked them. They said oh, your pager didn't ring? We called your name a while ago..... But the fact is that we were in front of the reception desk all the time.... And then, we got sited. My plate and knife were dirty...... Food has good size, good, but it doesn't worth 1 hour waiting. Tips for people, if you have waited too long, make sure to ask them.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340
Beer W.,"San Jose, United States",10,130,20,4.0,30/4/2016,"Decent food for the price point. Their avocado rolls are the best. Their chicken entrees are also consistently solid.  Their salad are so so.  The cheesecake and the carrot cake are also super awesome.  Which is no surprise to anyone.  They also have very late hours on the weekends, which is a definitely plus in this area.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340
Ashley L.,"Los Angeles, United States",249,9,20,5.0,5/3/2017,Went out to the mall and decided to grab some cheesecake. Well we ordered 2 pieces togo and made sure to ask the guy that took my order if they were prepackaged. He said they were so we proceded. Litsten I always come here and wait like an hour to get seated so I usually dont mind. Tonight I ate dinner already and just want my favirate cheesecake for my birthday. Well nooooo I still had to wait -____- 25 minutes when I saw my cheesecake sitting on top of the counter. Our server Austin looked at us and walked away! There were 6 people behind the counter and only one was preoccupied by a customer! The other staff was just standing around while there were boxes and boxes waiting to be given to customers who had already PAID! I always get a skimp ass piece of cheese cake from this location and crappy service. Maybe I should wait for new management to return im tired of wasting my money. There was a point where i came in at least once a week for a slice. Not now -____-,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340
bao t.,"San Diego, United States",0,11,,1.0,19/9/2016,"The qualify of food here is not consistent by any means, but we've never had a bad experience from this location...until now. My wife ordered a burger and requested medium rare. I ordered the steak and also requested medium rare. My steak came out overcooked, but I was fine with it since it would take too long for them to make another. My wife's burger came out looking OK, but a few bites into it, she showed me the burger and it was very rare! The burger patty on the inside was red and completely uncooked. How two requests for ""medium rare"" came out entirely opposite is beyond me. The manager came over and acknowledged the mistake, apologized, and offered her another dish but she declined since she has lost her appetite. The bill came and unsurprisingly, they charged us for the burger. We were mad, but there was no point in arguing and ruining our Friday night.  They need to change their billing policy and not charge for flawed food. If you're going to charge $12 for a burger, at least do it right. I've had a small mom and pops restaurant comped $80 of food because it was salty. A huge restaurant chain like this surely can swallow $12.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340
Sara J.,"San Jose, United States",1,23,,5.0,19/9/2016,Came in on a Sunday night (9/18/2916) and we had the pleasure of having Ramon as our server. He was very attentive and sweet.

Sam C.,"San Jose, United States",3,12,1,5.0,16/9/2016,"Did a little ordering in tonight and we decided on trying some appetizers to pig out! We got the loaded baked potato tots, sweet corn tamales, and the sliders. The tots and tamales are amazing and were the first things gone, the sliders were dry and really needed cheese and maybe some kind of sauce. With the crazy long menu I think doing a few appetizers is totally the way to go here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340
Jessica R.,"Fremont, United States",41,6,,5.0,2/8/2016,Celebrated my Birthday here. Our server was excellent really friendly and professional. I ordered the White Chicken Chili which was delicious. To drink I had the Georgia Peach cocktail which was really yummy. We ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls appetizers which is one of my favorite dishes - love the cilantro peanut sauce. I've received exceptional service each time I've been here whether I sit at the bar or get a table. This is one of my favorite Cheesecake locations I always recommend this location when friends want to go to Cheesecake factory. I picked out the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake for desert which is my second favorite cheesecake here now. They decorated my cheesecake for my birthday which was a nice touch.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340
Rocking V.,"New York, United States",7,118,37,1.0,6/3/2016,"This is the worst Cheesecake factory.  We ordered tonight through Doordash. The food arrived cold and tasted crap.  - Mac and cheese balls - someone had added salt twice! It was totally unpalatable. We simply had to throw it away.  - Everyone's Fav Pasta - is no one's favorite pasta. The pasta was uncooked! - Stuffed mushroom - was the only thing slightly edible They did not even include utensils. Seriously, for the price you pay, this is NOT the kind of crappy food you expect. Do they even do quality checks for to-go orders? It seems like they just make some crappy shit in a hurry and throw it out for customers.  This is easily the worst branch of Cheesecake factory. Going by the number of negative comments here, I doubt anyone reads these reviews or cares, anyway!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340
Cesar F.,"Oakland, United States",0,19,,1.0,12/9/2016,"I came in after having called in an order, at the time they told me it'd be ready to find out the order hadn't been put in. They told me to wait just 10 minutes and they'd have it up. It's not a lot of time, but the reason why I called in the order is because I'm in a crunch for time in the first place, so every minute counts.  15 minutes later the order comes up I'm handed a bag with the food, and walk out. No apologies from them, no discount on the bill. I get to where I'm going only to find out when I get there that there is no utensils or napkins in the bag. Nice!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340

I emailed them a few days after to tell them about my experience. The manager from the store called me and left me a nice VM & apologized and said he would send me something. Fast forward to yesterday. I got something. $15. That didn't even cover the cost of the meal which I didn't eat. So, I paid for a meal, tax, tip, couldn't eat my food, had to go out and get more good and only got $15. Thanks guys!  Way to show you care about my experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-clara-2?start=340
Tena V.,"CA, United States",24,109,159,5.0,12/1/2016,"Last night (Monday), 8 of us went for dinner and a b'day celebration. It wasn't busy (we got lucky) so we got seated immediately at 7:00 pm.  I want to brag on our amazing waiter, D. J. He was super nice and we never had to look for him to give us water and take our plates. I snuck a note to him to give our birthday guy a surprise cake and ice cream. He brought it as soon as the dishes were cleared and he and a few other wait persons sang happy birthday. They had wrote around the edge of the plate in chocolate, ""Happy Birthday, Allen"". Which made the surprise special.  All of our (generous portioned) dishes were delicious.   Thank you, D.
