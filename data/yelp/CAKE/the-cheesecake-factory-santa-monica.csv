Jane A.,"San Diego, CA",558,1674,2545,3.0,12/28/2017,"SUNDATE FOR CHEESECAKE Santa Monica doesn't offer a lot of dessert options. Weird, right?! We walked down multiple streets, around the waterfront, searching for something sweet that we had settled for cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory. HA! Of all places. The venue was a little fancier than the average CF I've seen, we were seated on the outside patio terrance to bask in the afternoon sun on a December late afternoon (SoCal is awesome for this).  CELEBRATION CHEESECAKE - it looks sweet, sounds sweet, but after first bite it wasn't death by sweet. Loved how it had layers and texture; mix of cake and cheesecake layers! Loved the cheesecake but the frosting top was death by sweet and I had to chuck it off to enjoy the remainder. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica
Y A.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,39,15,4.0,12/9/2017,We had great time there. We had crispy shrimp and small salad for starter. The shrimp was crispy but a bit oily. We had a steak with mushroom sauce and mashed potato and it was really good. We had also a hazelnut cheesecake and it was a blast! At the end we waited for 30 minutes for our check to be provided just because apparently it was lost or mistaken!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica

Karen C.,"Santa Monica, CA",168,288,821,1.0,12/8/2017,"Ahhh, I am so sad at how disappointing the food was here because I usually love Cheesecake Factory (other locations I've been to). The menu may be the same, but the way the food was prepared was awful. Dry chicken, not even sauce / taste. I thought this location would have great quality since it's such a popular downtown busy area in santa Monica, but I can see why this location's reviews are so low :( maybe their 1) chefs or 2) ingredient quality will get better in the future..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica

Eriny R.,"Los Angeles, CA",335,147,292,1.0,8/21/2017,"Update: from 3 stars to 1 star  came to visit this place again yesterday Sunday the 20th. I hate to say it but this time the bathroom was full of pee. I could even have my daughter who couldn't hold herself go there. We walked all the way to the food court to use their restrooms. This makes me really sad for sure.  We visited cheesecake on Sunday afternoon for brunch and to celebrate my father in laws birthday. It was early when we showed up so there was practically no wait. I did tell the host that we wanted to sit inside so she handed me a buzzer until an indoor server showed it. I gave the buzzer to my daughter who was super excited about it. The moment it started buzzing, she screamed out of excitement as this was probably the first buzzer she has ever held. We came inside right away and waited for someone to show us to our table. We waited about 10 minutes which was weird since the restaurant was empty :/.  They gave us a table that was roomy for 8 people so we were happy about that. I ordered the corn dogs and the fruit plate for my little ones. They placed the order right away and brought it out. The kids were super excited about it. Two bites into the first corn dog and they didn't want to take another bite. The fruit plate looked old and wasn't fresh.  We all placed our order and were waiting a good 30-40 minutes before the food came out. We ate all the bread on the table and got two rounds of refills on our water before the food came out. The server was really funny and kept making jokes until the food came out. I believe they may have been short handed on the kitchen staff.  I got the shrimp tacos off the skinny menu. They were very delicious but were lacking a little in overall flavor. I did ask for a side of pico to turn up the flavor a little. The beef medallions were also very flavorful. The cheesecake was delicious. I mean I would assume it had to be for the restaurant to live up to its name. Haha Now my biggest issue besides the wait for food was the restroom. I had to take my daughter in and it was filthy. I was afraid to even let her sit on the toilet.  Overall my visit was average and really not worth the big price tag that came along with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica

Robert V.,"Los Angeles, CA",3147,400,225,1.0,10/12/2017,"This is one of those chain restaurants that operate on volume rather than quality.  Considering this mall location with the exception of one has had every restaurant turn over due to the high cost of rent....together with the terrible service and sloppy food this will end up with what Eater LA says ""El Dunzo!"" Came here for lunch with four people and ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad and specifically asked for no tomatoes.  The food comes out and had chopped tomatoes all over the salad.  I sent it back and 15 minutes later (after everyone was done with lunch) my salad arrives.  Wouldn't you think the kitchen would expedite this order as it wasn't a heavy lunch crowd. The salad arrives and the lettuce was DIRTY, the 'crispy onion rings' were not cooked, and the salad was just disgusting.   Forget this location, as I had better food at a hot dog cart....

Rebecca W.,"Los Angeles, CA",740,320,746,2.0,7/3/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory was so sad. I think they completely forgot about us after they seated us. People who came in afterwards got their bread and we didn't. And everyone knows that Cheesecake Factory bread is NO FREAKING JOKE. When we flagged down a waiter to ask for the bread, you know what they said? Are you ready for this? They said THEY RAN OUT OF BREAD. .... ...... ............... ... ... What? How do you run out of bread? That's like Papa John's Pizza saying they ran out of cheese. What gives!??!!? Anyways, they said more bread was being baked and that we should just wait. Um, okay. So we waited. Anyways, when the bread finally arrived, we had been seated for a good ol' 25 minutes already, and they gave us one measley portion of each. Lol. Ok. I swear they used to give like 4 slices per table. We ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, the Combination of Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon w/ Mashed Potatoes, the Tira Misu, and the S'mores Cheesecake. Surprisingly our food came quicker than I expected. I was also decently impressed with how soft and tender the salmon was. It literally fell apart at the touch of my fork - that's how tenderly cooked it was! The steak was quite good too! V enjoyable. Anyways, food is food and Cheesecake Factory's is pretty standard. But the negligence of the staff here. oh MY. What's sad is that this restaurant chain is such a big corporation that it doesn't even matter to them if they improve their staff service / ignore me and other fellow yelper's complaints about their service, because people will continue going to Cheesecake Factory anyways.

We got seated really fast and we sat out door which was very nice because Christmas music was playing downstairs. The food was delicious but it wasn't a typical Cheesecake Factory where they give you a lot of food and you always have food left over. They gave you just the. right amount, that means you ate it all and nothing left over.

We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table during sunday dinner hours My issue continues to be about the food. The cheesecake factory menu in general reflects identity crisis. How can you expect to serve good food if you try to serve a gazillion different cuisines?  Ordered the crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp - while the batter was nicely fried and the inside was tender, the sauce was off, and too sweet for me.  The chicken and biscuits were ok, but the biscuits were not fluffy enough, and the mashed potatoes were bland The eggroll sampler is nice to share - you get 4 different rolls with 4 different sauces. The firecracker salmon roll was definitely overcooked. I think I will only come back for cheesecake...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica

Cheesecake Factory, this server needs to become a trainer/supervisor/lead because she has the service goods! She explained menu plates beyond detailed enough to make us happy with our choices! She was fast, not once did I see her stop walking quickly. She had lots of tables but still managed to give time to every time. She is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. If it wasn't for there it would be 2 STARS! Food Spicy chicken Chipotle pasta Very dry, not as creamy and little amount of chipotle sauce as I have tasted it at the grove or other locations. Cajun jambalaya pasta Hardly any flavor, noodles were plain. Shrimp were decent. Fried calamari SMALL Portion compared to other locations. (Pictures as reference) NEGATIVES: -Food is poorly executed -Restroom is has overflowing wastebasket and NO TOILET PAPER. I used the toilet seat covers, I even texted my guest to tell the male staffs to bring toilet paper but I used the covers instead. -There is a 10-15 minute wait for a table when the restaurant is huge!?!

We were asked to get one of those wait time receivers at the other entrance. When we got there they didn't have any and they made us wait to get one. The receiver also doesn't reach past the third floor. They should just take your number and text you when your table is ready like other restaurants. This is a bummer because it restricts you from going to the promenade. Also, when the receiver finally buzzes, you turn it in only to be out in another line.

Patrick W.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,37,35,4.0,11/20/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this location was not on point with their food today. The service was phenomenal and very professional. The ambience with the low lighting and outside heating made for a romantic and comfortable evening. We ordered the buffalo wings, firecracker salmon, and factory chopped salad. The chopped salad was a little overdosed with dressing to the point where it overpowered all the other ingredients. The buffalo wings barely had any glaze and was borderline burnt versus being crispy. The firecracker salmon was the only dish that was on point and was amazing. It was a perfect dish with perfect presentation. Overall, nothing was disgusting but just fell a bit short to the usual level I experience as a frequent customer to this chain. I still highly recommend this place and believe that tonight's experience was a fluke. You must try the firecracker salmon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica

H H.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,14,,1.0,8/14/2017,"I had dinner here Saturday evening and inadvertently left my credit card behind and this is when the nightmare ensues.  I called in at 10:30pm the following night to make arrangements to come by and pick up my card and I'm not exaggerating when I say, the phone rang 20 times before someone answered.  I knew that they were still opened because I had googled their hours and they were not closed for another 30 minutes.  I proceeded to inform the hostess that I left my credit card behind and gave her the necessary information for her to locate my card.  She then put me on hold and again I'm not exaggerating, for 15 minutes!  I decided that she must have forgotten about me and called back in. The second time, I let the hostess know that I had called earlier and someone left me on terminal hold.  She then told me she would need to put me on hold yet again.  I had a feeling I would get better results if I drive there and sure enough in the 11 minutes that I was on hold, I was able to drive to the mall, find parking and walk to restaurant.  In fact, when I got to the restaurant I told them that the person that they have on hold was actually me and showed them my cell phone which showed I had been on hold for over 11 minutes. I again informed the hostess that I left my credit card and asked to have the names of the managers who were working that night:  Mariana Lopez, Carlos Williams, Arianna Toledo and Wayne Maflin were the managers on duty that evening.  Yup, 4 managers and they still cannot get their act together.  Needless to say by this time, I've lost my patience.  Not one manager came out to address me but 10 minutes later, the hostess came out with my credit card.  I did not leave the restaurant until after the place was closing down.  Hence my Yelp review.   It is my personal belief that they were again understaffed that night as they had been the night before when I was dining there.  If they weren't, it wouldn't have taken 20 rings for someone to pick up the phone.  I would not have been placed on terminal hold twice for a combined total of 25 minutes and it wouldn't have taken them another 10 minutes to get me my credit card.   I have left my credit cards behind at other restaurants and none of them have been this horrific of an ordeal.  I call to tell them I'm coming to pick up my card, by the time I get there it's waiting for me and I'm in and out in less than 3 minutes.   Yes, it's my fault for leaving my card behind but I'm sure I'm not the first nor will I be the last to leave my card behind.  They seriously need to get their act together because this understaffing is going to severely affect their customer service, their Yelp reviews not to mention their repeated business.   Maybe the problem here is they don't care all that much about the regulars or the repeated business because they can survive on walk-in business from tourists?!?  Well if their reviews are low enough, they will lose some of that business as well.  I intend to post this review on TripAdvisor.  Hopefully someone in their corporate office will read this and care enough to make a difference in customer service.  It all starts at the top...if management sucks, if the restaurant is repeatedly understaffed, the service will suffer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=40

A little weird but still let it passed, then we waited another five or ten minutes for her to come and take our orders. When she came up to us she didn't even welcome us our introduce herself as our server. As time passed we had to ask for water every time we ran out or else she wouldn't even stop, empty plates were left on the table while we struggled to eat with the limited space.

I had to ask for lemons 3 times the 4th time I got it from a different server who I pulled over. Finally the meal comes out and I asked for my wine again. Meal came out and the bun looked to good to be true and he brought me fries instead of the salad I requested.

Aaron B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",535,215,232,4.0,9/21/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory like most of the world at some point. However this is the first time I've eaten here with the intent to eat healthy...it seemed like a daunting task but I think I may have succeeded. After doing research and looking up calorie counts, ingredients, reviews, etc. I opted for the Tuscan Chicken dish on the Skinnylicious menu. I ordered this for take-out and was pleased by the simplicity and ease of the process. I arrived 15 minutes after ordering by phone and my meal was ready and payment was painless. I then ate about 10 minutes after that back at my office. The food honestly surprised me. For just under $20 I got a pretty substantial dish of chicken breasts, artichokes, a ton of tomatoes, and asparagus (I substituted the farro for more veggies). The flavor was great, albeit just a little salty. There was some more oil than hoped for too which made me doubt the ""under 590 calories"" claim of the menu, however.  That said, if I'm looking to experience some new flavors with a $20 budget and want to be pretty satisfied as far as portion-size goes, Cheesecake Factory isn't a bad option! If you're looking to eat healthy here just make sure to avoid the carb side options (potatoes, rices, etc.) and load up on veggies.

Myself and my family on the other hand was okay with how everything came out and was impressed by a few things.  I forgot the name of our waiter but he wasn't that bad. With the occasional leaving our table unattended for a slight prolonged amount of time, the service was great.  It's weird to hear my mom praise anything that is western food but right off the bat she really enjoyed the whole wheat-oat bread. One thing I have learned is to always trust my mom's palate. Like mother like son, the bread truly was good. Is it weird that the first thing they put down for starters would foreshadow the rest of our meal? My aunt was feeling for some orange juice so she got that while my little brother got Diet Coke and the rest of us got water. Water service was great, other than the Diet Coke our water was always filled in a timely fashion. As appetizers we ordered the baked mac and cheese and wings. The wings looked dry when you look at them, but they were alright. I was impressed with the baked mac and cheese balls, that came with a nice serving of marinara sauce. It was delicious. I ordered the Cajun jambalaya just because I ordered it before. I forgot what my little brother ordered but we ordered miso salmon, herb crusted salmon, and then charbroiled steak.  The miso salmon is the only one I do not recommend. Although the salmon was cooked really well, the amount of sugar in the dish was just so unappetizing to me. My dad who loves sugar even thought it was too sweet. The rest of the dish was good. Oh I also ran into two of my high school friends which was neat.  Overall great place to eat. I had a great time.

I thought I would never come back to this location, but I was in the mood for Cheesecake Factory for my birthday today and this was the closest location. Parking is also cheap here too. We went before the lunch rush. We were seated quickly. I ordered my favorite dish (Chicken Di Pana) but this location either doesn't carry it or the franchise decided to stop serving it. That was disappointing, but I found something else on the menu. Took a while for the drinks. We got our appetizer before the bread. Then waited for a while. Manager apologized for the wait again. I don't understand why there was a wait because we were there before the restaurant was busy. Food was good, but then had to wait twenty minutes after our meal to get to go boxes and pay the bill. Better service than the previous time, but still 3 stars for this experience. Cheesecake Factory has large portions and pretty good food, but the service at this location is subpar and you will end up waiting a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=40

MIND YOU, this is 4:00 pm, a very slow time for restaurants. I finally pulled the hostess aside (since we were sat about 15 feet from her podium) and asked if anyone planned on helping us. She said she would ask, but then just scurried over to the computer. Finally after about 15 minutes a waitress came over.

Then he didn't even bring us bread. What got me was he gave bread to the people right next to us. I didn't understand that at all. It took him forever to get me my drink and for a while I thought he would forget that too, but it came eventually. My food took a long time to come out but I expected that since it was so busy.

This is the 2nd time I've had horrible service at this particular location. Both times one person in our party did not receive a portion of their meal. This specific visit was the most offensive since it was the actual meal.  Wait staff is nice and friendly but very extremely inexperienced.  The manager is equally inexperienced in managing such situations as they offered a casual apology but nothing beyond that. I frequent many restaurants and the manager sets the tone and standard for level of service. I've even been to restaurants where my meal was accidentally delivered to another guest and the manager profusely apologized and not only removed said item from the bill but also gave me a giftcard to use at my next visit (I'll be visiting Snooze in La Jolla without a doubt). The manager today and my previous visit only offered a lackluster, half heartfelt apology.   The best part of my visit was when I told the server to wrap up the salad only to have him say but I asked them to rush it.

First, the waitress and waiters seem very unhappy to be here. They often ignored us, spoke only to each other, and moved extremely slowly. When our waitress took our order, she did not write anything down. Therefore, it was not surprising when our orders came out all wrong. My friend ordered pasta with no onions --- it came with onions. My other friend ordered the salmon and it was cold by the time it arrived at the table. I ordered an omelette with spinach, tomato, ham and avocado. There was no avocado and mushrooms instead of tomato. 3/4 of the orders came out wrong.  When I asked them to fix this, they took twice the amount of time to bring me my omelette back --- and it still had mushrooms in it with one piece of avocado. I gave up and just ate this. The potatoes that came with the omelette took another 20 minutes to get here, which by this time, we were completely done and waiting for the check. In fact, the check arrived before my food even got here. The waitress seemed very grumpy to have to fix these mistakes.  Definitely avoid going here if you can.

Yeah, I really don't know why I went here during vacation. Anyways, it was a weekday lunch hour and not busy. Generally, the place looked neat and clean. The workers - not so much. Uniform and appearance do not always reflect service, but I felt like that was the case during my visit. Cheesecake Factory, Santa Monica - please (enforce) some kind of hygiene / appearance policies on your workers. Long fingernails, an unkempt appearance and a sloppy uniform are just not acceptable. After ordering our food, we were served essentially room temperature water. As if that was not enough, my plastic cup obviously had some leftover food particle. I almost always use a straw when drinking from restaurant cups - and this visit was not going to be an exception. A second request for straws had to be made, but it eventually arrived. I forgot what we ordered, but I remembered I did finish my plate (they're fortunate I was hungry, or I might've been more critical of their food). I believe my girlfriend finished her plate too. My biggest gripe during our visit had to be our utensils (see photos with knives and napkin). I cleaned my knife by dampening my napkin with a little water and vigorously rubbing the knife. The knife on the right is the one I cleaned, and the knife on the left is the one I was about to clean (my girlfriend's). The napkin shows the dirt that was removed. I believe this location attracts more tourists than locals and constantly has different customers. Hence, this establishment's inability (or unwillingness) to improve their service; they don't really ""lose"" business as a result of their poor service. Yes, poor service (see that 2-star review?).

The wait is NDB because there's a ton of window shopping you can do during that time, if you're into that. We walked around, but sadly for me and to my wallets relief, I didn't buy anything. We timed it perfectly, because when we came back up, it was our turn to be seated!  I love the set-up because there are so many cute little booths all over. If you get a window seat, you may be able to nom and people watch. It's the BEST! I don't like to be too adventures with this menu. I go with my oldies but goodies. Avocado egg rolls for apps (the sauce is yum!) and chicken madeira for the main dish. Never disappoints. The only thing that really sucked and almost made me give them 3 stars is the service. Sooo slow. SO nice! But sooo slow. Good thing they're consistent with my usuals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=120

The gluten free bun was completely soggy and after two bites turned into a mush. The waiter apologized, but it is obviously not his fault that the kitchen was not up to standards. There were tables next to us that were also having issues with their meals and unfortunately for the waiter we had, it was also his table.

Fried chicken sliders: These are usually fantastic and really help scratch that Chick-Fil-A itch. Here, the chicken is overcooked. Hamburger sliders: Again, usually excellent but dry and overcooked.  Crab and artichoke dip: The dip is fantastic, but the crostinis are...you guessed it, dry and overcooked.  I could keep going, but you can pretty much apply this to most items on the menu.

My appetizer came out cold and they did bring me a fresh one.. after my meal came out, but it was nice to have something to snack on while I waited for them to bring the correct toppings for my sandwich.  The manager was by far the worst part of our experience. She literally argued with my roommate when my roommate brought to her attention that her sandwich was missing most of the promised ingredients. The manager did comp the meal but not before LITERALLY ARGUING that the sandwich had the correct items when it visibly didn't. Who does that??

The drinks and food both took a little long but the nachos were legitimately the best I've ever had. The chips were seasoned well enough to be eaten alone and were strong enough to not break despite the heaps of cheese, guac, salsa and sour cream. Some chips felt legitimately heavy in my hand from all the toppings. Finished the meal off with a strawberry cheesecake and it was delicious as they always are. The cheesecake came out almost instantaneously, evening out the wait for the other items. Took a while but was well worth it so I'll give it 5 stars.

Romayo S.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,4,2,1.0,1/2/2016,"Utter disappointment.  We went to the new cheesecake location at Santa Monica place a few days ago for a weekday lunch  We ordered the Luau salad, chicken scampi pasta, sweet corn tamales and a BBQ chicken pizza. This is our go to order, we have ordered this many times before at other cheesecake locations.  1. The waitress, Rochelle? Michelle? Rachel?, was so soft spoken we couldn't even hear her name. When we ordered the pasta dish, she asked us to specifically point out the name because it seemed as if we were describing a dish, not ordering one. Aren't the staff supposed to memorize the menu?  2. We got the bread, which was warm and tasty like other locations. Then the food came out, after a seemingly longer than usual wait and the waitress took away the rest of our bread. WTF.  3. The food was not that hot, if anything lukewarm. The salad was anemic. See side by side pic for the luau salad we had at the Newport Beach location in November vs the one we had in Santa Monica. Where is the salad part? Seriously it was all wonton skin. And no, it's not the lunch version because there is no lunch version on the menu.  4. The pasta. We cut into the chicken and it was raw. Not pink verging on cooked, but RAW. So we flagged the waitress and she had them fire a new one. In the meantime we finished the rest of our food, another waitress tried taking our plates, even though we were still waiting for the pasta. Finally what it seemed like the manager in red came over with a new pasta, asking us to see if the pasta is to our liking. It's not that we were picky about the taste, we were bothered by the fact that it was raw and risks bearing disease. Anyway yes, the chicken was finally cooked. But now there was an issue with the taste of the pasta. The sauce was not cooked all the way through, just tasted like cream and raw garlic. At least with the first pasta, the sauce was an actual scampi. Midway through this pasta, another waiter brought out another chicken scampi dish, even though we already got one.  5. We were so sick of this place that we didn't even order a cheesecake. We thought we would at least get comped the pasta dish because we had to wait again for another one that was subpar to begin with. But nope. We were ""comped"" for the second pasta dish that was brought out by mistake.  All in all, throughly disappointing. Terrible representation of the brand, and of the locale. Luckily tourists will surely let it thrive. Next time you are at the promenade go to any other place to eat, seriously.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=200

Andrew C.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,156,,4.0,8/22/2016,"An average of 2 1/2 stars is way too low. My review would probably be 3 1/2 stars, but I'm rounding up. I came in here for lunch today and had a fine experience. There was no wait for a table (it was about 1:15 on a Monday afternoon), and the only reason service was a bit slow at the start was because the server in that area was tending to several large groups. I can absolutely forgive that since that's out of anyone's control. I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich and thought it was tasty. It wasn't cheap, but it's certainly a better-made sandwich than you'd get at a chain sub shop. The fries that came with it were fine, although I did have to ask for ketchup. All told, I was in and out in about 45 minutes, which goes in stark contrast to many reviews I'm reading now. It's almost as if I went to a completely different restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=200

We also got the crab and artichoke dip and it was so good but they give you only 6 small pieces of bread of go along with it which is definitely not enough unless you are scooping up 2 tablespoons of dip per bite which is too much in my opinion. We also got the crispy fish tacos - AMAZING, the carbonara - pretty good and the burrito which is just average. Service was a little slow but the place was packed so I understand.

They cut my grilled cheese sandwich in to 8 strips. Then gave me one quarter the normal amount of fries in a little tin cup. Big let down. Edit: I got a few comments saying it was the kids grilled cheese. I did not order the kids grilled cheese and was not charged for a kids grilled cheese. I was charged full price. I got a message from the cook saying it looked like I had gotten a kids grilled cheese and next time he would make it right. I still don't like the fact  that 2 years or so ago they started putting french fries in a cup and serving you half as many on all the meals.

However, my party was very patient. The whole back and forth, hostesses looking confused was just weird and uncomfortable.

Harley G.,"San Diego, CA",0,135,26,3.0,6/18/2016,"This eatery is located in the heart of Santa Monica and blocks from the beach. This location is surrounded by shopping stores and offers an excellent view of Santa Monica. Upon locating this location, from the street level, one has to take an elevator to get to the actual restaurant. Once arriving to the hostess stand, I remained standing waiting to be greeted for about two minutes before any acknowledgement. It felt awkward to be in a full eating establishment and no one there to greet you at the hostess stand. After being seated, about six minutes later, a male came by the table and dropped off silverware. He actually placed it onto the table with no napkin or paper to protect silverware from substances on the table. That was upsetting to see and disgusting. Request was made later for new silverware. Consideration of germs please!  The server arrived and food was ordered. The server seemed like she wasn't excited to be working. No facial expression of excitement.  The food arrived promptly after placing the order. However, there were no drinks with the food or straw therefore, had to wait for drinks and straw to arrive before being able to eat. Personal preference, but staff for the most part seemed rushed and unhappy.  The sandwich ordered was a southwestern as requested. Tasted fresh and the presentation was quality looking. The sandwich was filling. Another person at the table ordered a chicken plate. The chicken was tasty and presentation looked appealing.  Unfortunately, on this visit, the little things mattered though. Having to wait for the check for 15 minutes after eating was also not appreciated. Training could be considered to benefit sales and constant quality level of service to guests. At this point, there is no reason to rethink of visiting this location. Improvement on their level of service should improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=160
Joey W.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,4/8/2017,"Most unusual and memorable restaurant experience I have had. Not in a good way. The customary process of sit, order, eat and pay was a challenge here. We went to the bathroom between dinner and dessert and when we came back the dinner dishes were cleared. A moment later, a hostess tried to seat a party at the table. We told her we were waiting for our dessert, and - by the way - had not paid our check. Over the ensuing minutes, a series of increasingly responsible restaurant staff came over and confronted us, accusing us of various and sundry misdeeds, including ""self-seating"" and demanding that we leave the restaurant. A young woman did an exceptional impersonation of Columbo, demanding that we describe our waiter in detail and explain - if we had eaten - where the dishes and our drinks were (""We don't clear the drinks after dinner""). Finally the manager came over and started the same routine, I responded as before. At this point I didn't even care about the desserts, but kept reminding them that I had not paid a check. Finally, they located the waiter and the manager came back to explain that there had been a series of mishaps: table number was in the computer wrong, then the bussers thought we left when we went to the bathroom, then the desserts fell over before they could be served. I don't think he really apologized for those mistakes, and hey, things happen. But he definitely did not apologize for several members of the restaurant staff accusing us of all manner of misdeeds and crimes and trying to kick us out of the restaurant. He ""graciously"" took one of the desserts off the check. For having been embarrassed, interrogated and accused (because of their series of mistakes), I got $8 off. And since this is an entirely honest review, I conclude by saying that the carrot cake was awesome.  Don't go here.

Shiran W.,"Culver City, CA",24,41,34,1.0,10/5/2016,I don't think I've ever given a business one star before. If there was a way to give them zero star I would. Now you have to first understand the full situation. I was so pregnant about to pop (tired was an understatement) a friend came in town that I haven't seen in years so I decided to meet her at the food court for our kiddos to play. I wanted to eat healthy and there was no line at the Cheesecake Factory so ignoring the bad review I went in. I mean how bad can take out be? WRONG! The lady at the bakery was friendly and nice. My husband wanted something different it was basically buffalo chicken strips with the sauce on the side. I wanted the standard Miso salmon. Mine turned out just right they got him the wrong thing after already missing my friend for 15min waiting I had to go back and tell them it was off. Honest mistake. I waited maybe 10-15 just for the manager and he reentered my order this time correctly. Me being pregnant I had to stand (no more room to sit) another 15min waiting. Slightly annoying no big deal. Except when I got the order it was wrong again!!! I didn't realize it until I got to the food court. Back I go to let them know. I ask for the manager right off who didn't show up!!!!!! I waited and waited standing again The lady who was nice that helped me finally after 15-20 minutes ran back to the kitchen to start a new one acknowledging the kitchen screwed up. Now this is 45min missing out of my quality time with my friend while standing there 9 months pregnant where the manager did not show up to speak to me until I asked for him 3 times!!!!  I finally got the correct order 1 1/2 hours after placing the initial order. By then hubby famished already ate poor daughters pizza from the food court. I voiced my frustration with the manager when he finally came over. He said he will send me a gift card as an apology and got my address promising to mail it immediately. It never showed up. A week later I called for the principle to complain spoke the main store manager said she would look into it and give me a call back for sure.

Maria Teresa R.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,5,2.0,8/7/2017,"DO NOT RECOMMEND  -Rude Service  -Rude Hostess They say customer service is key to the success of any client based establishment & first impressions or customer greetings go a long away. Went on a dinner date with the hubby early Sunday evening called ahead & was told 10-15 minute wait for a table for two. Got a pager & waited & waited & waited several minutes passed & we noticed someone had left their pager behind on the lobby seat & it was going off so we decided to turn it in & be honest about it that though it wasn't ours we wished to turn it in & since we were waiting for a table & whom ever had left that pager behind wasn't going to use the seats could we take their place?? Blonde hostess double checked with another dark haired girl behind the hostess counter to see if it was ok & 2nd girl said NO, mumbled something under her breathe & gave us her back umm O.K. we figured there wasn't much time left to wait on our pager anyways & gave them the benefit of the doubt perhaps it was a table seating larger group whom the pager we turned in belonged to. We waited & waited & waited saw other groups being called, we were so hungry by this point & noticed a couple whom had arrived long time after us called to be seated I couldn't believe this?! I spoke to the blonde hostess again asked for an explanation why was there a hold up on our pager when we already had been waiting 20minutes if not more after double checking our phones on the time & other couples were being called who'd arrived later. She tried double checking our pager to see what happened & apologized for the process, she asked the same Rude dark haired girl with the receding hair line, blue eyes, & brown matte lipstick from last time behind the hostess counter who seemed to be in charge of monitoring the pagers on the computer screen, I asked to know what happened, the dark haired girl just muttered you'll be seated O.K. that didn't answer my question obviously something is either screwed with their system or pagers are falling off the grid, I persisted can you tell me what happened I don't understand earlier we were nice to return a forgotten pager & honest to admit it wasn't ours but request the table paged because we'd already been waiting little over 10 minutes which had been granted was the wait time anyways for us & was blatantly without regard denied & now your dismissing our request for an explanation?! again she replied you'll be seated pursed her lips & gave us her back wOw. I was stunned this was the most disrespectful disregard to clientele satisfaction I've ever experienced, no apology, no B.S. excuse at the least for having dropped the ball & not having called us, no restaurant courtesy compliments for the faux pas plus blatantly rude behavior from the dark haired miserable hostess with receding hairline. Computer error can be easily dismissed, rude miserable attitude towards dining customers??? I don't think so. It's sad that that girl is one of the first things you meet because otherwise the rest of the staff, ambiance, hostesses, servers are totally on pointe on trying to make your dining experience elegant & tasteful, but that dark haired hostess just totally brought the experience to shoot down the drain from the start.

The waiting was fairly short, about five minutes when the restaurant was barely full (6 pm). Waiter took a while to greet us, but we had our menus so we were browsing. We ordered and received our waters. The food arrived fairly quick as well and tasted delicious.  But, the reason for my low review was the service I received from the waiter. We did not receive a napkin until we asked because no one had come by. We got a napkin when we were about 3/4 done with our food. We also did no receive any bread for appetizer. I thought it was just a Washington State tradition so we did not request it. As we were walking out of the restaurant I noticed that only our section of the restaurant with the specific waiter did not receive bread. Service should be the same throughout the restaurant and I feel like receiving napkin and break should be the basis of it.

This review is based on brunch at 11:30 on a Sunday. Service: let me get this out of the way, the hostess was great. And then there's this....I'm doing what I dislike so much on yelp, accurately assessing the service when it's dreck. Needless to say, not awesomeness. Had to ask 3 times for our server for basic drinks..3 times. Food items were all about 30 mins late. The worse it got, the more scarce our server was.  Ambiance: great for the mall; we were outside on patio. Food: ordered a couple staples for apps aka spinach dip and Southwest egg rolls. Both were as expected. Entrees: brioche breakfast sammy and chilaquiles, and what appeared to be 2 kids meals. Everything was wrong and cold when it arrived. We even had to ask multiple servers for syrup for the kids French toast . Oh, and they just decided to ignore some components of the order.  Begs the question, why not complain? I don't want to deal with the crap of correcting a crap experience on a nice Sunday morning. Plus, I didn't want to ruin the day for a clearly bad staff and manager. Paying it forward, as they say.

We made it clear when our server took our order we were here for drinks only. We chose to sit outside. The weather was a little chilly, so they had outdoor heaters on. It was miserably hot because of the heaters. We ordered our drinks, my usual strawberry martini!  My husband ordered for us while I ran to the restroom. It took 15 minutes to get the drinks. This drink is always the same no matter what Cheesecake Factory you visit. Not this one. I noticed the pink wasn't quite the right shade. It was too light pink. The strawberry on the side was hard and bitter. I guess the ones used to make the drink were the same. I drank it. I mean who wants to throw a drink away. That's  alcohol abuse. But it wasn't good.   Our server never checked on us after the drinks arrived. It took 20 minutes after we finished our drinks to get our check. The bill was near $30. It wasn't worth the price or the time. And we weren't even offered the bread service.  I would probably give it another try because the Cheesecake Factory's strawberry martini has never disappointed me until this one. It was the service that was the true let down. The patio wasn't even busy. There we only 4 other tables being serviced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=160
ChiChi Jojy K.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,37,11,1.0,12/21/2017,"Cheesecake factory ruined my birthday dinner. They lack professionalism and customer service. Our waiter, Gerard, was either inattentive or inexperienced as a server. We ordered appetizers and requested plates to share. Our plates came 20 minutes after the appetizers, and when they arrived, they were dirty and had finger smudges all over them. We let the manager know and he brought over ""different"" plates, which I'm pretty sure were the same ones we sent back. The food was mediocre. The servers need a crash course in food service. From our table we had a view of the cheesecake counter/area. I witnessed a server (African American male with thick red glasses) plate a slice of cheesecake and lick icing off his fingers. Then he proceeded to carry it out to a customer. Gross! If that's what they do in public, I'd hate to see what they do in the kitchen. The servers all hang around the cheesecake counter and socialize, while you're waiting 10-15 mins. for a refill, utensils, food, etc. And by the end of the night, the servers walk around the dining area (people are still eating) with slippers on, pants sagging, and their shirts untucked... I've never seen this before, ever. As a customer, it just leaves a bad impression.  I let the manager know about my experience and he just brushed me off.

Emilie C.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,15,7,5.0,9/19/2017,"As usual, the Cheesecake Factory was an absolute delight. I had been expecting the service to be a bit slow considering it was a Sunday evening and very crowded, but the service was great! The food was perfect. I ordered the Americana burger, which I've had quite a few times, and it was delicious. The meat was medium rare, just as I asked for, and the burger itself was deliciousness. The fries were amazing, too. My boyfriend couldn't stop picking them off my plate because of how good they were--we were both a bit (pleasantly) surprised. He ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which he loved. I tried a little and it was very well made. The service the whole meal was fast and our waitress was always one step ahead. She refilled our drinks as soon as they were half empty, and was attentive to our every need, frequently checking on us. I'll have to say this experience was a great one, worthy of 5 stars. And this isn't the first time it's been this good. I've been to quite a few different Cheesecake Factory locations and this one always seems to be the best.

Carlos S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,1,1.0,6/30/2017,"First of all, I hate give The Cheesecake Factory a one star, just because their food is truly good. I've been dining with them for years in San Francisco.         On Sunday, June 25th, we were visiting their Santa Monica location. They had a 20 minute wait which is their usual time for a table of 4 plus a kid. We got sat in 15, but waited 10 for our waiter to say Hi. Our waiter eventually came and took our drinks down. We order our drinks plus a kid's water. He seemed rushed so he asked if we were ready to order right away, which we said yes. He then told us, ""wait, never mind, I'm not ready."" He spend 2 minutes at our table looking for a pen in his apron, then finally took our order. We ordered a calamari to start and their bread which are both delicious. Our waiter brought our drinks and calamari but forgot about our kids water and bread and took down our entrees. Our Stella came with a dirty glass and which we told our waiter, he told us he would bring a new one in two minutes. Which was okay, since he seemed busy, so we just patiently waited.         When another staff dropped of our food, our waiter quickly came to check everything was okay and took our calamari before it was even half done. We all work in the restaurant business and we know how busy it can get, but pulling food before asking if the guest are done is just rude. We asked to speak with management at this point, the manager promised us a new Stella plus another calamari on the house. We got the other calamari dropped of by yet another staff member but still no Stella. We asked them about our kids water which they quickly brought. The waiter passed by about 10 minutes after, not to ask how we were doing, but to sarcastically apologize about taking our appetizers, we just ignored the comment.       The waiter brought our bill crumbled up in his hand, while shrugging and apologizing for not having any books. I get that, but come on! A crumbled up bill. We told the waiter we never received our second Stella and the first one was never drank so we wanted it taken off. He said it couldn't be done so we asked if the manager could stop by. After waiting for 5 minutes, we see our waiter and the manager walk by us laughing as if we never asked to speak with him. Maybe our waiter didn't tell him. Lucky we flagged down another manager. We told them we were really upset at the whole experience and both the manager and waiter were immature. She said she was very sorry, but would try handle the situation.         We finally payed and were about to leave our table when the waiter brings us a new Stella, which we refuse and he followed back by rolling his eyes. At this point we just wanted to leave and never come back.  Not only did our waiter not care about us, but neither did Carlos, A Manager. This place definitely needs better customer service, and that has to be taught from the top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=20

The hostess greeted us as we walked in and we were seated immediately. Afterwards, the waitress ensured that we had a great experience, by checking in on us periodically and attending to us with a friendly smile. I was also pleasantly surprised at how fast our food came out considering there were a lot of people in the restaurant. Food: I ordered the thai coconut lime chicken, expecting a dish similar to thai curry as the name and description suggests, but to my dismay the dish was completely different. The chicken and vegetables were coated in an oily pesto like sauce. I didn't taste any trace of the coconut milk or lime which was very disappointing. All in all the flavor in the dish was mediocre, and I wouldn't recommend ordering this.

Lol  When we met our waiter, I can tell she was taking care of us but in a rude manner. The tone of her voice and the things she says to you is a bit aggressive. The food comes out and they mess up on my gf's order. That happens but again with the way she talked to us.

Christina C.,"Glendale, CA",216,191,662,3.0,11/23/2016,Was second time and don't think it's one of the good places there. Well food is overpriced however service started really good but ended with 15 minutes waiting check and out waiter forgot about us. Maybe because order was not so huge compare to close table which order 5-6 meals for 2 kids and one adult. We shared one BBQ chicken pizza this time and 2 camomile lemon tea so in general we payed 27$ so which I think is a lot for small sized pizza with big thick crust. Btw last time we took fish tacos and they didn't said it comes spicy cuz I'm not allowed to eat spicy even a lit. But if u hungry it's better than food court opposite but be ready to pay 20-25$ per person just for little dinner.

You can see the ocean from the outside seating. The inside is gigantic as well with a nice bar area.  Dinning in: On a weekday it will be normal wait time. Food is absolutely delicious. Their menu is a book - and if you think i'm exaggerating you obviously haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory. They have a great happy hour too. Amazing drinks and every combination of food, why wouldn't you be happy? On a weekend, expect to wait 30-45 minutes and it will be PACKED. Good luck finding a seat at the bar. Still worth it though, ha ha! Dinning out: The only reason I gave this place 4 stars. I work in the Promenade, so I really come here 4-5 times a week for my lunch. I order takeout because I don't have enough time to eat in. I also want to say this: It is NOT the workers fault. They are very fast and generous when it comes to dealing with the lines. I have no idea why their management would put ONE person in the takeout AND bakery section. This place gets PACKED and one worker will be dealing with cheesecake orders, to-go orders, orders for online apps, phone orders, and running back occasionally getting food. Way too much for one worker, you're a chain put 2 workers at least. Would be 5 stars if I could rely on it for takeout.

But seeing as this is the second time I've gone since they opened, I decided to write a review this time.  The Restsurant was very busy, as it was a Saturday afternoon, so I'll give them an extra star for that. But seeing as every person on our table of 8 had something wrong with their order, the kitchen needs to get themselves together.  I ordered a burger, pretty simple, I figured it was a safe bet. This burger didn't come with lettuce, so I asked if they could put some on, no problem! (By the way, our server was very nice, my problem was with the kitchen.) So, the burger comes with the choice of a wheat bun, which I chose, but when I got it, 1) no lettuce, and 2) it was on a roll, like they give you in the basket when you sit down. I ignored the roll part but did ask for some lettuce. When I got it, I realized there was only tomatoes and cheese on one half of the ""roll"" I wouldn't call it a burger. And the other side just had meat, lettuce and a bun.  My brother in laws sandwich was missing the sauce, my father in laws salad didn't come with dressing, and my mother in laws didn't have the right one. The only meals that came out fine were the kids meal 1/2 pizzas, however it was one pizza that they made together (makes sense), but they didn't put it on 2 separate plates for the 2 separate kids.

When I finally flagged our server down, he thought we wanted the appetizers to come with our food. Why would we want that?! After a horribly long time the food finally came. It was fine, fairly standard stuff, tasty but not extraordinary. It took a really long time for our server to refill our drinks. We wanted to take some stuff home and he brought us boxes (but I noticed that he packed other people's leftovers - not sure why there was a double standard). We ordered some banana cream pie but they brought us a lemon. When I told our server he was dubious (dude, I know what lemon tastes like) but took it back and brought us the right one.

Tara K.,"Ventura, CA",1,21,32,1.0,5/22/2017,"Horrible! Three of us went to dinner , got some drinks and appetizers. Everything was fine . It's s prime location and the roof top view was unbeatable. However , that's the only positive thing about our experience . We ordered our food and the wait was over an hour. A manager came by to apologize. No big deal . Finally the food arrives for two of us. My food however did not arrive for another half an hour. When it did finally arrive brought by Katya , it was a well done New York steak  , I ordered a medium rare rib eye. Katya tried to argue that the New York was basically the same as a rib eye , not to mind the $10 price difference . Umm no , I want what I ordered and a New York is for sure not a Rib Eye. So I had to wait again for another 15 minutes while she brought another steak , a rib eye , medium well. They tried to tell me that the steak was rare because the red lights from the outside patio was making it look red. I used the light on my phone to show everyone it was mot pink at all . Either way a steak no matter how done or rare should not be tuff and flavorless like this steak was . Even the waiter agreed with me about the steak and couldn't believe Katya spoke to me the way she did. Especially for being a manager. The way she spoke to was condescending and rude and basically made me feel like I was crazy. I am in the service industry and I know how annoying costumers can be , and I was totally not being unreasonable . I just wanted a nice rib eye steak medium rare. Instead I got a free piece of cheesecake but no dinner and I had to send my meal back twice and waited over an hour and a half. I will never go back here. I hope corporate takes a look at the yelp reviews and 2.5 stars for this place and hires some professionals to come in and take over the management . They really have an issue with training . Katya is offensive and should not be dealing with customers at all . She lacks the knowledge of what a steak is and lacks the ability to handle issues with customers in a professional manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=240

Came here on a Tuesday afternoon to enjoy a meal with my mom and niece.  We were so excited because we love the restaurant in general. But our presence was not welcomed. We had a ""waiter"" named Connor who seemed to bring his baggage to work. He was very distant and hardly interacting with us. Literally took our order, brought the water, and came back with our bill. When we asked him for my nieces apple juice that came with the meal that she did not receive he got angry and defensive stating that we didn't tell him we wanted it. What happened to ""sorry about that mam, I'll bring out the juice right now"" instead he stood around for a minute chatting to another waiter. Im a manager in customer service and I would be upset to see my employees talking this way to customers. We received ""more help"" from other waiters walking by vs Connor. When we let the food runner know we were splitting our plate he said ""ok"" and walked away. No extra plate?  If you want a nice dining experience do not go here. 30 bucks I could have spent to make a meal at home and be treated with respect. We didn't even stay for dessert. We took our service elsewhere.

When you finally get an order placed, the time it takes to prepare your food is pretty average.

I have waiting up to 10 minutes before between the time they called someone to come over and when someone actually arrived. And the restaurant wasn't even busy!

We arrived approx at 745 pm and were told to wait about 15, minutes or so, after seating down at 8pm we were approached by a server who introduced himself but failed to take any drinks orders, he said he will be back.  About 10 to 15 minutes later the server came and took our drink order and food order. we then waited 15 minutes to get the drinks which is unacceptable. The drinks came at 830 and as he placed them on the table he spilled the skinny margarita on me, the guy felt so bad I told him not to worry and dried myself off, at this point I'm a little upset it took 30 min to get drinks and no appetizers. Roughly 10'to 15 min later we received my drink and had to wait a few more min for appetizers which was unacceptable. I then asked about the food and received it around 850 approx , the steak and burger were asked to be medium rare but both came well done, when I asked the manager how they look he said well done and took them to be replaced. Meanwhile we had to wait till about 915 to get the food at that point I was starving and even thought the steak now came cold I just ate it. Also forgot to mention had to send my drink back 2 or three times as it was made incorrectly, also we asked for napkins and Parmesan cheese about 3 times. When we got the bill the manager refused to take the steak off because he said I ate it.. I told him it was cold and he started trying to negotiate with me, this was so embarrassing, he then said he will give me 50 percent off which was unacceptable, when I refused he said ok I'll take the steak off but add the 50 percent back, this isn't let's make a deal!! You guys clearly messed up spilled an alcoholic drink on me and now want me to pay?? I left 45$ on the table and walked out with my family.  Note the manager twice said we are a new store we only been here for a year..

The Bad: Service.  OMG!  I initially thought our server simply didn't have a clue.  We had a party of 4, my wife was still deciding what she wanted to order when the server approached.  My wife asked the server to get everyone elses order in our party first so that she could decide between 2 meals she was contemplating, and the server responded that she would come back to the table when everyone was ready to order.  WTF?!?!  We're not easily angered, but found the waitress' response odd to say the least.  The rest meal was peppered with stand offish comments, unpleasant attitude, long waits(drink refills and bread), and overall just bad service.  As I mentioned before, I assumed the waitress simply didn't have a clue, however after we paid (including an undeserved tip) and left, my wife admitted to me that she overheard and witnessed server giving very good service to a table adjacent to ours.   I wont speculate as to why we received such poor service when a table next to ours received the exact opposite from the same server.  But I have absolutely no desire to return.  This is a management issue.  As a business owner, I am completely aware when one of my employees is providing subpar customer service.  You guys really need to step your game up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=80

I had a totally different experience at this location. We waited almost an hour for our food to come out and when we finally got our food it was nasty and wrong. My boyfriends meal had hard noodles and hard chicken. He sent his meal back and waited almost 30 minutes for his new order to show up. My meal was ordered wrong I asked for no onions and my meal came with onions. My meal also had no flavor and the noodles were dry. My daughter had ordered fettuccine from the kids menu and we were charged an adult meal. I told the waiter that her meal was supposed to be a kids meal and that the food was wrong and it didn't taste good. He didn't apologize or anything. He didn't offer to take it back or make the correction on my bill for my daughters meal. This was the worst experience ever. The service was bad and so was the food.

He took our order and was helpful with getting our drinks to us quickly. Other than that, this Cheesecake Factory visit was disappointing. First he said they were out of the wheat bread, which is really everyone's favorite. Eventually he brought some out, but oddly it didn't taste fresh baked or warm or anything. Next I ordered the reason I come to Cheesecake Factory the few times a year I'm in a city that has one, the Chicken Bellagio. When the food came out, he apologized because they were out of Arugula, which is like an important part of what makes the dish. I wish he had told me WHILE placing the order, so I could order something else. I didn't have the choice to return it as my toddler and I were hungry and nap time was approaching. (They were out of arugula before the lunch hour, which seems like bad planning?) The waiter didn't offer to discount the meal, and I was also charged for the half lemonade/half water my toddler drank, which seems silly for a family restaurant to charge so much for something that costs them virtually nothing. I could have saved a few dollars just letting her share my lemonade, but seems like limiting the spill factor with a smaller cup with top was for their benefit. Dissatisfied with this visit, which is disappointing because I rarely get a chance to travel to a big enough city to have a Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=80

Second waitress comes over and said we would need to talk to the hostess about moving to this table because it was not set up for happy hour. Go to the hostess and she could tell by now I was starting to boil over. She took us right back the same table and we started all over again. We order the Nachos, a Greek salad, Macaroni balls, and some Tex Mex rolls. OMG!! the nachos were disgusting with that cheap wax cheese that can last a nuclear war.

Don W.,"Marina del Rey, CA",223,236,1282,1.0,1/10/2016,"I came for Sunday brunch with a group of 6.  I was actually surprised there was no wait, because at any other CF I've been to on a Sunday at brunch time, there's at least an hour wait. We entered on the side with the elevator, and sat on the patio near that entrance. If you sit on the permitted by the glass wall, you get a great view of the 3rd Street Promenade.  Our group was too large for those tables, so we sat In a booth on the opposite wall. The patio is covered, which is great, so you still get the feeling of sitting outside, without sitting under the sun. They also have heaters above the table in case it gets cold.  I didn't realize how HUGE this restaurant was until I had to use the restroom. This is probably the biggest CF I've seen, in terms of the number of tables.  Our server greeted us quickly after we were seated, and the beverages and bread followed quickly.  However, waiting for the meal to arrive took an unusually long time, especially for CF, where the service is usually speedy. Most locations have the speed-of-service down to a science. Not so much with this place. However, after I saw the size of the restaurant, it's clear to me that the kitchen is just too small to handle the volume of tables -- and the restaurant was half empty when I was there.  When it did arrive, everything looked fine. I ordered the California Omolette. You can see by the photo I attached that the plate looked fine...until I tried to eat the toast.  The bottom of the toast was nearly burned BLACK! And the cook obviously tried to hide it by serving the toast black-side-down.  How is this place going to survive if their cooks can't even make toast correctly? I gave my review 3 stars because our waitress gave great service, and I didn't have to wait for a table.  But the reason I come to CF is for the food, and for this experience, the food came out late and not well prepared.  This was by far the worst CF meal I've ever been served.  Note to management: please get your act together at this location.  Most of the traffic on 3rd Street is tourists, and when they see a Yelp average of less than 3 stars, they're not going to dine here. UPDATE - January 9, 2016 I've reduced my rating from 3 stars to 1 star for the following reasons... I returned to the restaurant with 3 family members for dinner, and we sat at a table in the bar. Our waitress was great, very attentive.  When we ordered, two of us customized our orders. Nothing that difficult, just replacing cheese with avocado on a salad.  The first time the salads came, we realized there was cheese and no avacado. We each took a few bites of the salmon that was on the salad before we realized this.  Our assigned waitress had gone on break, so we told our sub-waitress and she took them back.  She returned about 10 minutes later with the salads. This time with no cheese or avacado. Also, they put the same half-eaten salmon back on the salads. So we asked for the manager, hoping that he could remedy the situation.  When he came to our table, he apologized for the mistake.  He returned about 10 minutes later with our two salads, again with half-eaten salmon on them. We pointed out to him some pretty obvious things that he should have spotted as the restaurant manager. First, he was serving new salads with cold, half-eaten salmon on them. Second, how would he have known who gets which half-eaten salmon?   He apologized again, and took the salads back for a third time. At this point, the other two people at the table were almost done with their meals, so the manager said he would like to buy them each a cheesecake, so we are not eating alone by time the salads comes back out for the 4th time. He also said that he would not charge us for the salads. He returned about 5 minutes later with the salads, but no salmon. He said the new salmon was still cooking, but he didn't want us to be waiting for our meals any longer.  About 5 minutes after that, he brought the salmon.  When the check came, the two desserts were listed as free, but they were still charging us for the salads.  So we had to ask for the manage AGAIN to fix that error. This meal turned out to be way more frustrating and stressful than enjoyable.  This restaurant has a long way to go to reach the level of high quality food and customer service that the Cheescake Factory has spent decades to build at their other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=100

Annette G.,"Carpinteria, CA",0,14,,1.0,7/17/2017,"I would like to state I have been a waitress for over 5 years. We sat near the bar on the tables with the high chairs. If facing the bar we were the table second from left to right. Directly behind the host. Last night 07/17 my boyfriend, cousin and her boyfriend went out to eat our favorite place The Cheesecake Factory. We have been to the Topanga and Thousand Oaks locations great service every time. However, our waiter (male, light skin, spoke Spanish, not positive on his ethnicity) gave us THE WORST SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!' You ask why? Hmmm well we immediately got seated out our table, not greeted, table was completely empty. No napkins or utensils. Okay, of course as a waitress I understood they were busy no problem. 25 minutes later STILL no idea who our waiter is at the time because we have yet to get a simple ""hi so sorry, I'll be right with you or even greeted us."" I waited 5 more minutes now sitting on 30 mins. Finally went up to the host and asked who our waiter may be to let him know we're ready for him or her. She apologizes and says I'll go find him so sorry for the wait.  Again, no problem maybe there was a misunderstanding. Finally, our waiter comes up to us and apologizes and asks what we would like to order.  First I said can we please 4 waters all around AND may I get fettuccini pasta no chicken, later my cousin, boyfriend, and her boyfriend ordered after me. We also ordered drinks.  Another 20 mins and we ask the waiter when we will be getting our drinks? He said oh that's right LET ME GO GET THEM. Honestly, our patience was starting to run out with this guy.  Everyone got their pasta EXCEPT ME! I asked the our waiter how much more time until I receive mine. HE TELLS ME I NEVER ORDERED ANYTHING. EVERYONE AT THE TABLE HEARD ME WORD BY WORD ASKING THE WAITER FOR MY PASTA.  He later orders me my pasta and apologizes ok, a bit upset at this point because once again the service just getting worse and worse. The pervious busser who originally brought out the food for my boyfriend, cousin, etc finally came with my food. Great, awesome at this point I was relieved to finally get food in me. We noticed our waiter coming with another plate of fettuccini Alfredo and quickly turn around noticing I already had my food. Aka I did order my food it just came late okay that's fine. THIS WAITER NEVER ASKED US HOW OUR FOOD WAS, OUR DRINKS WERE EMPTY BEFORE WE GOT OUR FOOD AND DIDN'T ASK FOR A MORE, AGAIN WE DID NOT HAVE ANY PLATES, BREAD, NOR UTENSILS.  I STILL HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD YOU THE BEST PART..... MY COUSINS BOYFRIEND PAID FOR THE ENTIRE MEAL AND HE SAID TOLD US, guys I'm sorry I'm not going to give this guy a tip the service was trash no excuses. I will admit we did leave a tip $1.75. We start to leave the restaurante and my cousin and boyfriend are left a little behind so they could quickly finished the two drinks they ordered. THE WAITER RUDELY COMES US TO THEM WITH THE TIP BACK AND PUTS IT IN THEIR FACE AND SAYS ""YOU FORGOT YOUR CHANGE."" THEY RESPONDED WITH KEPT IT AND WALKED AWAY.  FEW SECONDS LATER, THE WAITER COMES BACK AND FLICKS US OFF. HONESTLY, AGAIN I'VE BEEN A WAITRESS FOR OVER 5 YEARS. YOU GAVE US TERRIBLE SERIVE THE WORST WE HAVE EVER HAD IN OUR LIVES AND NO APOLOGY FOR YOU LACK OF SERVICE AND YOUR COME BACK TO US IS FLICKING US OFF IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT AND CUSTOMERS. NOT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL. I'm blaming it on the company I solemnly blame it on the waiter.  After leaving the restaurant I immediately called the store and asked to speak specifically with the manager and let him know about what happened. He apologized and I said thank you however, it was not his fault but his waiter/ co-worker.

After 30 minutes passed, I went inside to check on our table. Brittany the front desk greeter said the system was down so the pagers don't work. She claimed to have called us for our table but we weren't there so she gave our table to someone else. Her solution? Put us back on the list to wait another fifteen minutes. She lied. She did not call us when out table was ready. Other customers outside had been called for their tables - we were not. Brittany's did not accept responsibility for the oversight, and instead lied. When I objected, she screamed ""You can't talk to me that way! Do you want the manager?"" What I wanted was a table. At that moment in time, a an employee, she was the Cheesecake Factory. Rather than accept blame and be accountable and correct the mistake, she became confrontational. Was I upset? Yes. I had a right to be. It was her mistake.

My daughters order was being split with her friend and when it came out, no second plate was brought. When she came to check on us, she saw they were eating out of the same bowl and asked if someone was bringing another plate. At that point, they were basically done.

My friend and I were having a beach/shopping day and decided to grab lunch here. We get seated. Our waitress alycia comes and is very uneducated of the menu. I asked her if they had a specific cheese and she said I don't know I'd have to check on that.  Later when it's time to order we place our orders. The bread hasn't been brought out yet. But every other table around us got theirs. So we asked her kindly why we're having a delay. She said it's still in the oven it'll be a couple more minutes.  A couple more minutes turned into 30 min after we got our food she brings the bread and asks if we still want it. Umm no how about you drop that attitude of yours and take it back. Oh the cherry on top was when our waitress randomly avoids us and when we asked the other waitress she rudely said ""ask your waitress"" well then. Someone doesn't like their job.

She didn't check on us after the check was placed at our table....yet she continued to ignore our many gestures to get her attention. When all else failed we spoke with another waitress to try and have the corrections made. She notified Dakota and instead of coming to our table, she waved us off. LITERALLY. She made the ""shooing"" motion and said ""one second""....from across the restaurant. I'm not sure if she thought we were blind or hard of hearing, but we definitely saw and heard their interaction. The new waitress came over to our table and apologized. She let us know that she spoke with Dakota and she would be over shortly. While we waited we watched her laughing and talking with her coworkers before slowly walking towards our table. As we politely expressed our frustrations over the mistake on the check, she interrupted my mother numerous times and then walked off. Needless to say, we will never visit this location again.

Ashley was really calm and polite and professional. She said she would see what she could do to calm them. Within 5 or so minutes the kids were calm. They were just two young kids being kids but she was calm through the whole thing. She said if wanted to move we could  she could move us. We said no we were fine. Ashley wrote me a little note on the bill that said P. S. sorry about the day care I thought that was kind of funny. I wrote Ashley a little note thanking her and how professional she was.

Madeline L.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,4,16,1.0,1/24/2016,"Very disappointed with this Cheesecake Factory location...  I ordered the Shrimp Scampi which was served on a plate whose edges had not been wiped clean prior to sending it out of the kitchen. I turned a blind eye to that in hopes that the quality of my food would make up for this. Being very hungry, I was eager to dig in. Unfortunately, part of my pasta was undercooked. The first time it was sent back, my waitress offered me some soup or salad while waiting for the kitchen to process a fresh batch of pasta. I asked for the soup, but that soup was never served to me. My food was served within a few minutes and to my surprise, the pasta had been more undercooked than it was the first time around. I immediately asked for the manager. He wanted to reimburse me for it so he offered some cheesecake. The bill was then put to our table and I was still charged for the Shrimp Scampi which I barely consumed. Again, I asked for the manager who did not hesitate to remove the Shrimp Scampi from the bill.  I expected more from this huge and beautiful location. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and my food had to be sent back to the kitchen twice because it was undercooked. The highlight for the evening was the front desk staff who was very courteous and also the fact that I did not have to wait for a table. Overall, it was not an enjoyable dinner.

Catherine G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/8/2016,"Dining at this Cheesecake Factory was probably one of the worst dining experiences I ever had. A group of 8 of us went to dinner to celebrate a friends 30th birthday. To start we were told the wait time to be seated was half an hour, not too bad, but 45-50 minutes after we got there we still had not been seated. I went up to see what the deal was and was told they were ""clearing"" off the table and it would be 5 minutes, 15 minutes later and two check ins, we had still not been seated and  we were told it was going to be 5 more minutes. We could see a number of empty tables and it wasn't until the birthday girl went up to say we were leaving that they sat us. Now to the actually dining and wait service. Once we actually got a table we were sitting for about 15 minutes before our waiter even came by to introduce him self and take drink orders. We had to ask for bread, which didn't show up on the table until another 10 minutes, and we had to ask for refills on our drinks. About 30 minutes in we finally were able to place our food orders and who knows how long it took to get the food but it seemed like an eternity. The order was mostly correct but they forgot the birthday girls food. The waiter never really made a appearance during our visit and we had to flag someone down to tell them we were missing items from our order. The manager at this point got involved and apologized, saying he was getting the samosas fresh and that he would ""comp"" the samosas. Good thing the company was nice or we would have all been really cranky. When it came time to pay the check we had to find the manager to get the bill, which came back to us incorrectly, it took them 15 minutes just to process the payments and make corrections. The manager had come by again noticing that we were all agitated with being ignored and offered up cheese cake. The birthday girl ordered and we proceed to wait another 10 minutes to find out that he was going to give a single piece of cheese cake to the group of 8. At this point we had already been at the restaurant for 3 hours and didn't want to wait any longer so we left without the piece of cheese cake.

She offered us complimentary soup since we had to wait for the bread, and it was really good soup!  Our food came, I got tomato basil pasta, and it looked less then usual at other cheese cakes factories. I told the server who called the manager, the manager was very nice, took my pasta and made fresh batch to add onto my pasta.  We got really good service, good food.

The sauce was too sweet and not slightly spicy like it's supposed to be. The portions seem to be smaller at least at this location. My plate had only 2 shrimp so I felt like it's misleading to call a dish chicken and shrimp when there's barely any shrimp and barely any chicken.

Nothing special about the food either. The rest of us had burgers and pasta carbonara. They forgot to bring the fries with the burgers until we had to ask for it. It makes no sense for them not to leave condiments like ketchup, mustard, and sugar at the table so the waiters don't have to keep going back and forth.

However, when our buzzer was notifying us that our table was ready the bus boy was walking us to our table to find out our table was given to some other party. Bus boy walked us out to the outside patio and informed us it will be a couple of minutes until our table will be ready. 25 mins just passed before we knew it we were waiting 55 mins overall!? So this short, Hispanic, long blonde haired hostess with some very heavy lipstick thinking she works at MAC cosmetics was walking us to our table with a stanky face along with a pathetic attitude. I'm not too sure if she was having a bad day or she just hates her job - either way a restaurant shouldn't have employees like her working for them because it reflects on the company in a very negative way.

We waited so long and the restaurant was empty! The manager made us feel that we were inconveniencing her..like her time to help me was so precious!  Forget it! With so many terrific eating options in Santa Monica, why would I want to wait for The Cheesecake Factory?!  My time is precious too Cheesecake Factory! Poor management and customer service!

Frank T.,"Santa Monica, CA",11,37,74,5.0,8/29/2016,"We went for a dinner Saturday night.  The little one doesn't share my taste but doesn't know what to order so I had to take a stab and order something I thought he may like.   He didn't like it very much (it really wasn't very good, I cannot remember the name) but the waitress (Christina!!) checked on us and I mentioned to her that the little one is not thrilled with his dinner and she happily changed it for us at no charge.  The picky one loved his pasta and meatball and all was well.  We really appreciate the good service and we will go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=400

Nikki H.,"Valencia, CA",0,26,10,1.0,7/21/2016,"We decided to go to dinner at this location for my moms birthday celebration last night. We, as a family, go to a Cheesecake factory location a few times a month and have always had a great experience. This was our first time at the Santa Monica Location. We were extremely disappointed and frustrated with our experience from start to finish. We were greeted by the hostess, who was rude and had no personality, she looked miserable and we felt quite unwelcome. When we were seated, we waited about 10 minutes until a server even acknowledged our table. While waiting we noticed that the silverware was dirty and a couple of our bread and butter plates on our table were dirty as well. When she finally greeted us, she threw the beverage napkins on the table and took our drink order. The drinks finally arrived after 10 minutes, one of the water glasses had dried spinach on it, after we pointed it out, she took it away and said she would bring another. I asked if she had any straws on her, she said no I don't and walked away. I wasn't sure if I was going to get a straw with that response. Five minutes later, she arrives again with a new glass of water, with no spinach and a few straws. She took our order and then the waiting began. It took almost 30 minutes for our food. Our food slowly staggered to the table, approximately 5-10 minutes in between each drop and there was 7 of us at the table. As each meal arrived we noticed that there were some issues. We noticed that my mom's pizza was cold, my husbands turkey burger had onions all over it and no mushrooms and a different bun than what he usually has with it. My brothers skinny turkey burger arrived a little after my husbands with a different bun than my husbands and had mushrooms and he was missing his side of double vegetables. My brothers wife's Kobe burger arrived over cooked. She ordered it medium, it was definitely well done and it had a sesame bun. She said she always orders that burger and it has never come with a sesame seed bun. The manager, his name is Keith, happened to be walking by, so I raised my hand nicely and gestured in our direction to come over. I wanted to tell him what has happened. First thing he says to me is, ""its rude to point"", then laughs. Not a good first impression. We all did not find this funny as we were quite frustrated at this point. We told him what happened and he said, ""well did you tell your server?"" (why did that matter?) I said ""no, I saw you walking by and decided to go to the source, as we have quite a few issues."" . He said ""ok what do you need?"" We began to go through the list of issues. He said ""ok I will get a new Kobe burger in five minutes cooked medium, a side of double vegetables, a new bun for your husband"" (turns out my husbands hamburger bun was gluten free. He had ordered the french fries gluten free so we can share, but he can have gluten, so the bun was not necessary)... ""anything else?"" We told him that we needed more ketchup and my mom's pizza was cold. He asked if she wanted another, she said no, he said ""okay we'll take care of that pizza for you on the bill. Ill be back with everything in 5 minutes."" I noticed him walking around and not in the kitchen, where he should be, getting these issues fixed for our table.  After 15 minutes we inquired about the re-fires on the fly from our server, she ended up coming out of the kitchen with the new bun for my husband as his turkey burger was freezing cold at this point, we didn't bother saying anything.  Over 30 minutes go by since the Kobe burger was taken back, we stopped the manager again to ask about the Kobe burger and veggies, he said ""you still didn't get it"" and walks away. After going to the kitchen, a few minutes later, here comes my brothers wife's Kobe burger, still overcooked and still on a sesame seed bun. My brother waited for his wife to eat, so he was now eating a freezing cold skinny turkey burger 30 minutes later, with still no vegetables in site. About 45 minutes later after our food first dropped comes out a tiny side of vegetables. What a disappointing dinner that was. Everyone ate at separate times and did not enjoy their food. We have been sitting for almost two hours at this point we wanted the check and to just leave.  The manager gets our table a free cheesecake, big deal. Took 30 minutes to arrive. We were there for about 3 hours. NIGHTMARE!!!  Horrible service, management is just awful! Ended up paying over $100 at the end of the day for a miserable dinner and bad service....we just wanted the nightmare to end! We remained quite calm through all of this, it honestly felt like a joke, what can you do but laugh....and then yelp about it. Me and my husband are servers, have been serving for over 15 years, we get that sh*! happens! But its all in how you handle it and how you finished. Horribly handled, finished even worse! Stay away, even the servers know that this place is messed up! Got to The Misfits right down the street!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=400

Ashley was our waitress and she was there to greet us with a smile and take our drink order almost instantly. The delicious bread followed right away and all our food came out rather quickly and all of it was delicious! Ashley checked in on us regularly and took very good care of us.

So we stand there. Then I was fuming by then so I go back to the counter on the mall side. Tell them what happened and Jen or Veronica tell Maria(the hostess) to handle it!!! Maria had no idea how to handle this so my son sits at the first of many tables that were open. They clean it ok I guess.

Donna C.,"Santa Monica, CA",62,2,5,1.0,1/9/2016,"We came by around 2:30 PM on a Sunday and the restaurant wasn't busy. We wanted to order take out since we had our baby with us. We ordered a burger, a lunch special pasta, and a red velvet cheesecake. We were told it would be about 20 minutes. After 25 minutes pass by my husband goes up to the desk to ask if the food was ready. They said they were waiting for the pasta to be ready.  45 minutes later we FINALLY get our food. Keep in mind...the place was practically empty. No one apologized to us...in fact the lady behind the counter seemed irritated that we asked how much longer we had to wait after 30 minutes.  We decided today to give this place another try because we figured they just opened and they were still working out some kinks. NOPE!! Once again we ordered take out. This time a salad and the Jamaican Shrimp. The wait wasn't as long as last time (about 20 minutes). When we got home we realized THEY FORGOT THE DRESSING to our salad AND the bread. WTF!

Never have I ever been anywhere with such poor service. I timed it - from the time I was seated to the time we were acknowledged by our waiter was 16 minutes. Take in mind it was 9:30 - not busy at all.  Also we were seated at a half booth and we kindly asked the hostess that was seating us if we could get a booth. She said ""that might be difficult as we will have to walk back up to the front to see where we can seat you"" totally unacceptable.  Not only did my menu have food and grease in it but so did my friends.  Food is consistent however service is the worst I have ever seen. I always see the manager going back and forth not quite sure what he's doing?  The solution to this problem is hire senior wait staff and waiters that care and don't congregate in one area and hang out.

We order our food and a hour goes by and the manager comes out and says they burnt my food and had to start over. Meanwhile people with dogs are being sat all around us after the hostess told two people earlier that only service dogs were allowed...these dogs were not service dogs in fact they barked their heads off through our whole meal.  When our food finally came it was mediocre and not cheesecake quality. The salad was wilted and the food that was ""burnt and all new"" had half of the burnt pieces in it and was way too salty. Meanwhile, another tables had half their main courses delayed by 20mins while the other half got their food.  The table next to us ordered chicken wings and they were raw and bloody...unfortunately the guy was half way through his meal when they discovered the raw pieces. When the bill came 2 hours after we sat down, they didn't remove or discount anything for the horribly slow service and disgusting food. I will never eat there again.

Well, over the weekend (Sat) we went for a late lunch. Me and my kids along with my ex. We were ask either sit inside or outside. Inside as a longer wait. Well, they called us and walked us all the way to the back and outside. We told the server we asked to sit inside and she confirmed and apologize because the front desk messed up. Said we can wait and talk to the manager for an inside seating. It was such a mess and we were blocking the way so we said ok to sitting outside. It was hot but there were a fan above us and covers so it was not bad. Our server was quick....so quick she took the order, drop our drinks and no straw for me and never came back until we had to flag her down. Our appetizer of calamari cam quick. soft, great batter but super salty....did they forgot to clean off all the salt? I still enjoy it until the server came and just grabbed some that we were still eating and left. Our food came in good time.....just I did not get any dressing for my salad. I asked for some and the girl look at me like ""you want dressing with your salad?"" look.....I said yes, I like some Ranch. Got that pretty quick and I spent quite a bit of time picking out he rotten pieces out of the salad....they were from a bag and the cook did not even bother to check how bad there were...dont worry I was able to get about 10-15% of edible ones. My ex got the Mahi (tuna) salad and it was so bad he had like 20% total eaten and this guy eats alot. We were done pretty quick, not because we were full, but the food was so bad. However our server gone missing for about 20mins and came running back saying there was some emergency......we got our check, paid and left.

We waited for 25 minutes and it never came. Bearing in mind the cheesecakes are already made and all they need to do is put a slice on a plate and bring it to you, we were astonished at how long we were made to wait. We asked (who I assume was) the manager if it would take much longer, and she just kept saying 'your server will be with you soon'. Since we had somewhere to be and almost half an hour had passed, we got up and were about to make our way inside (where the counter with the cheesecakes is) when the manager told us to sit back down and 'your server will be right with you'. Our server was not right with us. So when the manager turned her back we had to sneak inside without her seeing. Once inside we told a different server about our issue. She looked like she was sucking on a lemon but did take us to the cheesecake counter. We asked for our cheesecakes, got them in a to go box and left.

Once our server finally showed up she reeked of cigarette smoke and gave us a very bland greeting. She took our drink orders my boyfriend asked for water and I got a Coke as I always do. The Coke tasted extremely sweet like a Diet Coke and was also flat. When it came time to order she wasn't very informative on menu options. I ended up ordering orange chicken and my boyfriend ordered a make your own chicken sandwich with fries. When the waitress came back with our orders,  she did not come up to our table to deliver the food she delivered it from over a small wall we were sitting next to you which I thought was very odd. Was she just lazy? She didn't bring the sauces we asked for on the side and our fries were completely cold and stale. Being in a rush for at the movies we just ate them anyways. Another server had to bring our check because our server was nowhere to be found. My boyfriend and I are amazing tippers when the service is worth it. However for this woman we simply left her a note in her server book saying "" Maybe you should be a little nicer then you'll get tipped. Your attitude was like the food. Cold and stale "". I really expected more from this visit. And just to mention I have worked in fine dining for a very long time so I have a very keen eye for what good customer service is supposed to be. This service would have been obviously bad to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=460
Dwight M.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/22/2015,"Beautiful new restaurant open only for two weeks. Usual extensive menu with lots of good choices. However, not yet organized. Simple meals for party of six. Main courses not served at same time.  Last person served after the rest of us were half way through our meal. We tried to order their famous cheese cake, but most of them were not available because they were frozen. Service generally very slow taking two hours to finally get everything served.

Our order took a long time to arrive and when it did,  one of our party didn't get his food--took another half hour for his food to arrive! They did comp his meal and the food was excellent. The big disappoint was that my cheesecake was not good. No excuse for that when your restaurant is named Cheesecake Factory. The cheesecake had a hard crust on top like it had been sitting uncovered too long and did not have a dense consistency--too fluffy. I like a good cheesecake. I will go back though, hopefully they get better with practice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=460
Jean R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/30/2015,"My daughter was visiting and we were looking forward to going to the new Cheesecake Factory here in Santa Monica. It was a Sunday afternoon glad to have gotten seated pretty quickly. We got seated then waited for seven minutes before our server acknowledged us, no asking if we wanted water, something to drink, etc...it wasn't like he was busy either. Also, a lady in a purple shirt walked by...possibly the manager bc she asked another table about their food. Anyway, our waiter Ross finally introduced himself, yep we were ready to order. We had to ask for ice tea refills, no ice... Food was great. I will probably give them one more try.

Lisa K.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,8,,2.0,11/30/2015,"I was thrilled when I heard that the Cheesecake Factory was coming back to the westside!  I've been there twice now.  The first time, at least everyone was pleasant.  The service was just a mess.  We had four waiters attempting to serve us food that wasn't ours.  It was so long before we got OUR food that we were tempted to take someone else's just to start eating already.    The food was subpar but it was only the second week. The following week, we went on a Saturday night.  It was very crowded and we were told it would be a 30 to 40 min. wait.  Then I asked about a table on a patio facing the mall.  I was told that would be a 20 minute wait.  So I switched to that.  25 minutes later, I was told we had 13 minutes to go.  The hostess was mad at me because I pointed out a mistake she had made earlier.  I figured that was punishment.  Meanwhile, two tables sat empty on the patio for at least 20 more minutes and then she sat someone there that came way after us.  That was it.  I got a manager's attention who said he'd take care of.  I guess if you call waiting another 10 minutes taking care of us he did.  The rest of the service was fine though.  But that hostess had a real chip on her shoulder.  I hope they clean house soon to make it a more pleasant experience for their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=460

D W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,26,,1.0,4/11/2016,"The service at this Cheesecake Factor is AWFUL! The manager, Sara Mayorga was unpleasant and unhelpful when we visited over the weekend. First of all, we arrived in the morning and the restaurant was EMPTY.  Then we were told that we needed to wait 5-10 minutes for a table...not so. Thirty minutes later they wanted to stick us in the bar with babies!  The manager said that she didn't have any servers available but yet we saw 3 employees standing behind the bar chatting/socializing.  We informed the hostess we wanted a table outside if possible but then settled for inside the restaurant...but heck...inside the bar?! Then Sara gave me attitude and said ""there's no one drinking in the bar"".  Not true! There were a couple of guys drinking it up but that's not the point!  We didn't want to be in the bar, we wanted to be outside and then settled for inside the restaurant but we drew the line at the bar.  Sara wanted to stick us wherever she thought was best for her since she said ""I don't have a server available"".  Well...why didn't the restaurant staff properly??  Or ask a server to cover a table in the restaurant? Why should a customer have to be stuck in a corner near a big huge pole in the bar with babies because the manager failed to staff properly?  Rather than being pleasant about the whole incident, Sara proceeded to talk about me with her employee right there when I was around.  Sara is very unprofessional and there's a reason why this location is so poorly rated.  We will NOT be back. We ended up going to the CURIOUS PALATE on the same level to eat..we were VERY pleased.  The Curious Palate food is fresh, the owner was appreciative and came out to talk to every customer.

Tina R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",31,6,,2.0,6/4/2016,"very unsatified at this location. The hostess was nice and the waitress was ok but it's the meal that I paid for. First off they have an A rating and I'm not sure why. I had to return sets of silverware that had food left on them three times. After the third time it was clear I wasn't getting clean silverware so I took my napkin and dipped it in the water to clean my silverware the best I could and rubbed the heck out of it to make sure it was clean, at least cleaner than what they gave me. Then I ordered the soup and salad which came with sourdough bread and butter on the side. I had to wait longer for my meal as they said they were making a new batch of soup. Great, fresh soup! But not so much. They brought my soup with a new spoon that also had leftover food on it which I had to clean AGAIN!!! Then my soup was lukewarm, what happened to fresh batch of soup? Lastly, I asked where my sourdough bread and butter was and the waitress said it never came with bread and butter, on Y the free bread that's served before the meals. I checked the menu and it states, soup, salad, sourdough bread, and butter. Lastly, the soup sucked and my stomach hurt for a good two hours after. Not loving the Santa Monica location at all.

Next, she was refilling our waters and there was a clear sauce container in my friends glass. I work in a restaurant and normally this would be considered a ""foreign object"", and I would have at LEAST mentioned this incident to my manager.

And after I gave my 3 eslice of joy coupons to the waitress for free cheesecake, she came back to say that she had given them back to me and wanted 3 more.  But I came in with 8 coupons and I only had 5 left, so I said she must have them after all.  She found them after all. The french fries were too salty.  They said they had pancakes but didn't, so my other child ate the burned pizza instead.  My Cobb salad was good.  But after we left, I found myself wondering why anyone would pay $75 for the meal that we had.  Luckily the cheesecake was free, but still.............Given the wait time and the disappointing food quality, I'll wait a while before I come back. The good thing is that I was able to pay and swipe my parking ticket before the 90 minutes was up so I didn't have to pay $1.25 for the parking. When they opened originally, they had made some errors on my order and promised to mail me a $25 gift card.  They never did.  I guessed that they were busy, just opening up in this new location, so I didn't pursue the matter.

She told us to give her a few minutes to ""figure out the situation""... so we waited... and waited... THIRTY MINUTES PASS BY and still no drinks. Like how hard is it to get us our drinks?! She didn't even check In with us to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything else, yet she was happily serving other tables next to us. But it gets better. One of the food runners delivered our drinks and accidentally placed the beer in front of me instead of my dad, and me and my mom were busy taking pictures to notice. LINDSEY comes up and scolds myself and my parents for allowing ""kids"" to take sips of ""adult"" beverages and told me that I could get her in trouble with her manager. After I told her that I didn't even TOUCH that beer, she still insisted on giving me and my family an earful about ""kids"" and these ""adult beverages"". LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IM TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD MYSELF. Who the hell she was calling a ""kid"" I have NO IDEA. Absolutely insulted and angered by our rude waitress, she avoids our table altogether.

Getting seats might but difficult especially if you come with a bigger party but reservations should help out. The floors were slippery the day I went and I don't know if it's a common thing or someone spilled something so just be careful, sometimes people come in heels and you wouldn't want to slip! Service is quick and there are two main exits, though the elevator is usually congested.

Our waitress kept telling us how busy she was but when we would ask her for something she would go talk to her coworkers or wait on her other tables and then pass us and completely ignore us. I was so appalled by the service we just got up and left. Right after I called to speak to the manager and he said he would talk to her and get back to me and he never did. I doubt he ever talked to her. Never going there again.

Kylie was our server and from the minute we got drinks she was so rude. We asked for room temperature water and her immediate response was ""I can give you water with no ice"" smart ass remark, obviously that is room temperature. Second she didn't bring out any bread... We all know that's what cheesecake factory's do. I had to ask Don't we get some bread with our order. All she had to say was I can bring some out? A runner had brought out our food, she seen we had our food when bringing the bread. Not once did she ask if we needed anything grated cheese crushed pepper? I had to again ask for some... She just walked around bring items without talking.  If you don't want to service people work behind a cubicle, and don't talk to anyone.  I had to ask a hostess for her name but found it on the ticket when we got our bill.  NEVER had I have to go through experience like this.

We sat down today at 7 pm. Our server J comes by soon after, and asks us for drink orders. We order around 7:25 as that is the first opportunity to do so after we had put in our drink order.  Time goes by...I ask one person (who I thought was a manager) after another about what's going on. Each person say they will get a manager, but no one comes. Then the final straw was another couple of people sitting at an adjacent table, who had sat down AFTER we had ordered, gets their food at 8 pm. We still had not gotten our appetizer. J keeps trying to tell us that various foods take longer. Apparently I look like I'm an idiot since he feels that I will believe that 2 dishes of hot food will take longer to make than 2 salads. (The people looking like managers were trainers who were supposed to help the staff keep on target with their tables, but clearly this was a fail.) The only reason I did not give my review 1 star is because of the manager Rebecca. She was soo sweet, and acted like a true manager, taking responsibility for what was poor service, and making it right by us tonight. I will amend if we ever try going there again.

All the food was just heated and was not freshly cooked. I asked for the management to hear the excuse for the bad food and service but no one bothered to come and talk to us.

After our food arrived, everything seemed OK until I bit into my sandwich only to find a shard of glass between the inside. I was lucky enough to taste the piece of glass before anything worse happened. This really ruined what was supposed to be quality family time and I decided not to continue eating or request another sandwich. I was so traumatized by what happened I lost my appetite and ended up just leaving the restaurant after our night was ruined. And while the manager offered to not charge us for the sandwich or our appetizers,I don't feel they were as apologetic as they should've been considering severity of the situation.

I enjoy coming here with friends on occasion and the desserts are always tasty to boot! All that aside, service is the ultimate defining feature of a restaurant, and this place excelled at that. Molly was the Hostess and was very patient with me despite a bit of a wait. She was clearly doing everything within her power to make sure I get my table and I really appreciated that type of care and attention.  I was then sat at the terrace overlooking the third street promenade with Anthony as my server. He was also very attentive and easy-going. I tend to be a bit annoying at restaurants because I ask for a lot of water, but he made sure I was always cared for, and that speaks volumes of the service.

The party is made from mushrooms and quinoa and isn't a traditional garden burger which I appreciated. It was flavorful and had great texture and was very satisfying.

Dustin S.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",12,5,,1.0,1/18/2016,"To start off I rarely take the time to review anything positive or negative. However my experience at Cheesecake Factory was awful. I'm not a fan of most chains as I try and eat at smaller scale establishments. Before you say he's another snob that only expects the best experience at only the coolest joints, I'm a huge fan all kinds of out of dinner and comfort food as much at the sushi I eat on a regular basis. I'm rambling ... I went into the new CF after watching The Reverent (great gritty film) with my fiancé. She asked if I would want to go to CF (she knows I'm not a fan) jokingly. And I actually said, ""sure!"" To her surprise. The hostess promptly sat us in the bar table area. My fiancé went to the restroom and I returned a call while waiting at our table for her to get back so we could order.  She came back sat down as I continued my phone conversation for anther 3-4 minutes My fiancé and I chat some more after the call and we hadn't been asked out drink order or had approached us yet. We looked around to make eye contact with a server since we didn't know which was ours. We saw a table next to us that had 4 waiters around it with one waiter rubbing the shoulders of someone at the table. I assumed it was someone that worked there and everyone was stopping by to say hi. My fiancé and I both tried to make eye contact and my fiancé even tried to get their attention by saying ""excuse me"" with one of these servers standing next to us. And when we did they avoided our gaze and probably didn't hear her since it was loud, they walked away for us.   At this point we realized it had been a while since we sat down with no on approaching us.  I looked at my phone to see how long it had been since my phone call and realized we had been sitting at the table for 18-20 minutes and no one approached, dropped off water...  NOTHING.   We told the manager Ernesto on our way out. I'll say he tried to make it right by offering us a new seat, but we weren't willing to stay any longer.

The hostess told my party a 15 minute wait, which I thought was great for a Sunday night. We waited 35 minutes and then decided to check with her on the status. She informed us that she made a mistake and did not program the beeper. I thought okay mistakes happen and it's a new place. We were seated in a large booth right away which was great. We then waited for over 15 minutes. My wife finally got up to go and find a Manager to alert him of the lack of communication taking place. He came over apologized and offered to buy is an appetizer which was nice. After he took our drink and food order our server finally arrived. She seemed flustered and immediately started to apologize. I felt bad but my immediate thought was why didn't the Manager communicate to the server that he took out order. Our food came out timely with 4 people bringing our food including the Manager. Unfortunately, one of the serve handed me my plate of food which was extremely hot. I dropped it on the table before I got burned. The Manager didn't see but walked up as soon as all of the food was put on the table. He asked how everything was so I made him aware of what just took place. He apologized and offered to bring me an ice bag.  I refused but asked him to coach the server so this doesn't happen again. The key is that their communication is very poor amongst their staff as well as their training. Hopefully they'll improve but I just can't believe how unprepared they were. I will not be back.

Our waitress was the most inconsiderate server I have ever had. We asked for recommendations on new items and she pulled things out of no where and knew nothing about the appetizers. She said that Buffalo Blasts are just boneless wings, and they came as fried wonton wrappers! Someone needs to do their homework.  Then she rushed us to order and got upset that during our wait to be seated, we ordered drinks from the bar, meaning her tip would be smaller. Well, acting like this doesn't get you a bigger tip either.  When our food arrived, the Chicken Piccata (sp?) was extremely salty, cold, and the pasta was undercooked! When we told her, she rudely replied, ""So what? You want them to make you a new one?"" as she took our plate and went to the kitchen. Everything just got worse as the night went on, not to mention the unenthusiastic birthday they sang to me while giving me a small cup of hot fudge, with no spoon to eat it with!!

Kristen Q.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",211,700,1391,2.0,12/1/2015,"Oh Cheesecake Factory, you need some work as we all can certainly tell you are a BRAND NEW location and you just don't have it together like other Cheesecake Factories do in Pasadena and in Redondo Beach. Our waiter was pleasant but unfortunately he did have body odor which probably bothered only me since I'm sensitive about this. Every time he'd pass by, I'd get a strong whiff. BO is understandable after a long whole day of work but really if it's only 12-noon and the restaurant opened at 10 or 11am, really? Is it necessary to expose us all to that? Can you please use some anti-perspirant? In any other industry, maybe it's accepted if you're an athlete but if you're working in customer service, have some customer service smells to go with it. So all was alright until we started receiving our orders....the bf ordered a chicken sandwich and they brought him the wrong sandwich. And yanno, sometimes that happens! However, what really irked me is that our waitor insisted that his sandwich was the right sandwich and since the bf has been eating at Cheesecake Factory for years upon years on end, he knew it was not the right sandwich. So, they brought it back into the kitchen. But what sucked is that everyone else's food had already been brought out and now he has nothing to nibble on. Ok, I fib, he has a tiiiny salad. But the waitor essentially forgot the dressing? What gives?  So now about 10-15 minutes later the waitor brings out his sandwich and it is TINY!. We're all looking at it like, ""Where's the rest of the sandwich?"" So the bf asks, the waitor looks at it, and then he *insists* it's the normal size sandwich as the bf did NOT order from the lunch menu and ordered the regular portion. Finally after about 2-minutes of back and forth, the manager walks by and affirms that it is INDEED not only the lunch portion but the SKINNY portion size. So now they've messed up the order twice and everyone else is pretty much ¾ or almost finished with their meal. To top off the cake, even though I had specifically ordered the lunch portion and everyone in our party had heard including the person sitting right next to where our waitor was standing, the waitor gave me the dinner size portion and charged me for his mistake. Aiyah, a little too many mistakes, Mr. Waitor--I'm sure in a couple months you'll be a great waitor if you can just stop arguing with the customer when you make a mistake. That kind of just, stinks. Pros: Food is still great! There is absolutely no wait on weekends for lunch. Wowzers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=320
Aileen E.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,49,94,2.0,1/5/2017,"Ok, let me get right to the point.  Service was awful.  But I'm giving them 2 stars because I should have known better than to dine here in the first place.  We sat for about 30 minutes after ordering with nothing but bread. And you guessed it, that was the end of the low carb diet!  When the order came it was not prepared as described in the menu. We had to wait about 10 more minutes before the waitress came back to the table.  When i described the issue all she said was ""Awww..."". She didn't offer to fix it, bring something else or take it off of our bill.   We told someone else about the issue and that person just smiled, acted all cheery and said ""No way, oh I'm sorry."" Then she went and got our bill and put it on the table.  That must be some training technique, listen but do nothing.  Needless to say, I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=320
Shari P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,67,2,3.0,8/12/2016,"I have always like TCF with their extensive menu options. They were a bit late to the healthy food table but nobody's perfect. Last weekend we saw an afternoon flick and went to grab a bit to eat at Cheesecake thereafter. I was craving a burger and fries and that was when I discovered that on this huge menu, you can either be vegetarian or gluten-free but you cannot be both! They offer gluten-free burgers on every other option - beef, chicken, turkey patties, but no vegetarian. I don't know if you've improved your veggie patty but while you're making it gluten-free, you could definitely improve upon it - add more protein, that's what us vegetarians are often missing in veg items - and look into QUORN products, a non-soy mycoprotein source that is gluten-free! So I had a alcoholic liquid dinner of wine to help me cope with the disappointment that a restaurant with a menu the size of a book couldn't accommodate me. Come on guys, this is California, get with healthier options - if I can get a gluten-free animal based burger shouldn't I be able to get a gluten-free vegetarian option as well?? Everyone else loved their meals so I made this review a three-star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=360

A server told me that my server is busy inside and would get my drinks started, I ordered a cocktail and waited another 15 minutes for it to come out. This guy came to drop off my drink and didn't say hello or anything just stood there with his notepad in his hand so I asked him if he was my server and he said yes that he will be taking over for the other server. He was rude and didn't seem interested in coming to the table and checking in on us. I ordered the strawberry shortcake and my boyfriend ordered a strawberry cheesecake and we waited 20 minutes for it to come out.

Oscar G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Not surprised to see this Cheescake Factory has minimum stars. My friends and I decided to eat here for dinner for a friend who's leaving LA. As usual Cheescake Factory; waiting in line. When we were seated our waiter came and almost sounded too stern and stubborn, he didn't have a name tag so unfortunately I can't point him out, you know who you are. Anyways, I asked for a simple cup of Coffee and he rushed in and said ""so what kind of latte would you like?"" I said COFFEE, not Latte. Whatever I just got a latte not to fuss anymore. It also took a half hour for my friends to get their simple request of water. I ordered a shepherds pie since I wanted to try something new. It arrived well done but as I was halfway through eating I noticed a few pieces of my ground beef were raw, RAW. Cooked well on the outside but raw pink on the inside, what the hell? I questioned the waiter about it and he insisted that the meat comes like that, ""medium-rare"" he said, it did not. Another waiter came by since we STILL didn't get our waters, she looked very distressed and thought we said ""Eggnogs"" um what? Is your staff okay? I left Unsatisfied knowing my appetite was ruined. The waiter asked me if I wanted my plate fixed but at this point I didn't care anymore and told him it's fine. Threw away my raw leftovers and currently sick after eating unsuspecting raw meat as I'm typing this. Lesson learned, For the record my entire night was ruined because of this one mishap, Atleast ask me whether I like my meat RAW or well done. Disgusted.

Had to ask 3 times to get water, and another her 3 times to get some lemon and when he finally did bring it he brought it on a napkin wrapped up. I believe in a restaurant like this I should have received it on a small plate. The cleanliness of the dishes was really bad as well. Both forks and spoon I had was really dirty.

Antoine K.,"San Fernando, CA",1,6,,1.0,9/26/2016,"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. As you can see I seldom review places I go to but this place really deserves the bad review. My friends brought me here for my 21st birthday. First of all our waiter James did not say hi, he did not ask us how we are doing, he simply tossed our bread in front of us and asked ""you want anything to drink."" I know this is a large chain and all but I have gotten MUCH better service at much cheaper places. I order a filet mignon and it was great. Then after waiting 20 minutes for the check (not an exaggeration it was 20 minutes) another guy comes up ""hey guys your waiter James had to go on an emergency break Ill be taking over, did you guys get your 4 strawberry cheesecakes yet?"" And thus the surprise was ruined. My friend had gone to the ""bathroom"" to order the table surprise birthday cakes and this guy ruined it. We canceled them immediately. Not his fault, why couldn't James have said ""oh hey they have a surprise"" instead he kept up the consistently crap service he provided in the first place and all was ruined. Not a single factor of the whole night was redeeming. Once we talked to the manager he was very apologetic and said ""dont worry your cheesecakes will be free."" We were absolutely astounded WE DIDN'T GET THEM BECAUSE OF YOUR STAFF. So instead he payed for my steak which again, was nice, but I would have much rather paid for the food and have received nice service rather than get a free meal. And a side note the manager we talked to was a visiting manager and he was great, very apologetic and sharp. Once the actual manager of the place came over and heard the story and I had told him that Im going to give this place a bad review and not come back his response was simply ""ok cool"" and he walked away.

He quickly apologized, made an ""oh shit"" face, and walked away. 2) Our server didn't come back to see if we were ok. Didn't refill our water.  3) We were waiting so long for her to come back so we could ask for the check, so we asked another server. So that server gave us our check and we paid. Then the original server comes back and gives us our check again.. No communication amongst the staff whatsoever.  4) Last but not least, servers were very rude with no smiles on their face and not greeted properly.

I remember when the new one opened at topanga plaza it was the same thing.  Back again tonight and it has gotten better. Not 5* Better but better. I'm giving the 5* to counter balance some of the reviews that were excessive one stars.  There are still many good things about this Cheesecake Factory. Let them work on it and give them another shot in a month.  It will get better. Just like the one at topanga plaza.  Food is good, ambiance is good, cheesecake is good.

Also, thanks bartender when I told you I WASNT finished with my burger, you looked me right in the eye and took it away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=300
April D.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,89,68,3.0,7/10/2016,I had the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich! A little dry and not enough sauce! Sweet potato fries always on point! The service wasn't great for mid day lunch!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=300
Christian A.,"Willowbrook, CA",4,38,29,1.0,11/2/2015,I was so excited to see the new place at santa monica. Went to the bar looks likes all the the cheescakes nothing much has change there. Bartenders were great food was good to. They were out of tex mex eggrolls:(.         The only thing that did bother me was when they told us we had to leave. There was more guest inside the place as well so why can they stay and I had to leave. Felt very uncomfortable as they were rushing me down the elevator to leave. As a manager you have to know how to talk to guest in different situations. And theese two guys we're not professional at all.1 star for management he ruined for everyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=300
Holly O.,"PACIFIC PLSDS, CA",42,61,,2.0,2/19/2017,"I don't know if it was just this location but the service was just awful. It was a Saturday night so it was pretty busy and they gave us a buzzer to buzz since it was a 30 minute wait. So after about 25 minutes they buzz us and I gave my buzzer to a hostess at the front desk and she said wait in the lobby and a hostess would be with us. After approximately ~10 minutes and all these people getting seated that came in after us I went up to a man at the front desk and asked what was happening and he said they forgot to print out our names to put in this business card holder for the hostesses to call from. Finally the guy prints our names and apologizes and a hostess came to seat us but then the table that she took us to was already taken. So then she goes to find her manager that takes another ~10 minutes and we just saw an open table and sat ourselves and the manager said that was fine. The table was a little greasy and the silverware didn't look 100% clean and it was already 9pm. Then the waiter comes and takes our orders and took about ~10-15 minutes to just get the drinks. Then it took about an hour for the food to come out! They came by and said one of the sections of the kitchen was impacted and it was going to take a few more minutes but it was more like 30 minutes. The 2 tables that sat on either side of us got their after us and got their food and check before we even got our food. The food was fine, nothing special but not terrible. Then the manager came out and apologized and granted us a free dessert for all the troubles. We didn't get out till 11pm..... a 1 hour dinner turned into 2 hours.

Tiffany O.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/9/2016,"Usually Cheesecake Factory Restaurants are consistently good, but this location has excessive wait times, a lackadaisical staff that acts like they will never see you again (I guess that's because of all of the tourists but locals go to the mall too), and a kitchen that doesn't change out the oil in the fryers and can't guarantee cross contamination.

Robin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,1.0,2/22/2016,"If zero stars was an option, I would mark this review as that. I've been going to Cheesecake Factory my whole life. It's always been a great experience as you always know what to expect. It was my first time visiting the new Santa Monica location and I will guarantee that I will not return. I went in on my lunch break and it seemed a bit quiet. No wait, was seated as soon as I walked in. I waited about 10 minutes for my server to arrive to greet me. I placed my order for my meal and for a glass of water. I was brought a basket of very dry bread (I usually love their brown pumpernickel bread), but still no drink. It took him an additional 20 minutes to deliver my water.  I was then brought my entree immediately after my water which was extremely underwhelming. As the entree was placed on the table, the person who brought my food noticed that my table was wobbly. They notified my server who came by and let me know that he was going to fix it. He brought over some napkins to place under the table, without even asking me if he could crawl under the table while I was eating. He would rock the table to the point where my water almost spilled on me multiple times, no warning at all. Was this actually happening? I ordered a veggie burger wrapped in lettuce. The veggie burger seemed undercooked and completely soft. It was impossible to hold it to eat, and almost impossible to eat with a fork as it kept falling apart. It also came with a tomato that looked like it was chewed and spit out, and red onions that were cut extremely thick - not sure who would ever eat them that way. Also the actual veggie burger tasted like it was put on a grill that had never been cleaned - had a funky taste.

His ended up taking 20 minutes more so he was sitting there while everyone else was eating their pastas. Also the bar is horrible.

He replaced a wheat bun with gluten free bread and made the breaded chicken just grilled. He made it double the size also, and took it off the bill for time inconvenience. I also ordered a salmon special that had mashed potatoes and a dairy sauce, which was put on the side and replaced my fries.

Ann B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,5,3.0,7/1/2016,Very confusing experience during happy hour. The hostess told me that happy hour was at the bar and the tables surrounding the bar. There are  tables/booths in the bar area that face the bar. There were a lot of these empty tables so I sat there and waited for my teenage son to join me. The hostess promptly runs over and rudely says that this isn't part of the bar and there is no self seating. I asked her if she wanted me to move she said no I could stay there since the restaurant is not full. 10 minutes before happy hour is over the waiter brings over the happy hour menu and says that happy hour was going to be over in 10 minutes if i wanted to order that I should do it now. What?? Just at that moment a table of three women at the next table and also wanted to order from the happy hour menu. It seems that this area can either be switched over to non-happy hour if the restaurant is busy. Come on  cheesecake factory - don't be stingy just make this area part of the bar (it clearly looks like it's part of the bar) and just deal with it till 6 o'clock when happy hour is over. They could  build a lot of goodwill towards their restaurant instead leaving their customers with a bad taste in their mouth.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=440

She approached me and said sorry for taking 5 min I said no you took longer this is when she started arguing with me while in the presence of the manager she turned around and called me a bitch.

Missa K.,"Arcadia, CA",60,20,5,2.0,1/8/2016,"I'm here with a friend on a Thursday early evening, simply to have two pieces of cheesecake and that is it. Upon entering the restaurant a lot of waiters were just standing around the hostess desk looking like they were waiting for instruction. Our hostess took us  to overpopulated section of the restaurant that was not very busy looking, a lot of the customers only have water and nothing else. Upon being seated it took 10 minutes for me to flag down a waitress asking to be waited on. The waitress I flagged down told me she's not in charge of my table so she would need to find the waitress that was. Another five minutes later a different waiter came by our table asking if we had yet been served yet to which I replied no and he said that he was from a different section and that he apologized for the delay. And upon taking our order our actual waitress came by and and took over taking the order after the initial waiter had already written our order down showing me that the whole thing was very unorganized. It took another 3 minutes to get our waters to our table, and another 10 minutes to have our cheese cake slices delivered. Also I need to mention that when I looked over to the kitchen I saw a lot of wait staff just messing around doing nothing. I don't think that I am an impatient woman however I feel like the wait staff at this establishment needs a readjustment",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480
Marissa C.,"Modesto, CA",13,9,,2.0,7/17/2016,"Came to this location last night with a not so great experience. We ended up waiting more than double our estimated wait time for a table which is understandable because it happens. What was not so acceptable was the fact that we ordered our food about 15 minutes before the next table, and not only did it take over 40 minutes to get our food (not to mention we didn't even get bread to hold us over in the meantime) but the table next to us was already finished eating their meals by the time we got ours. What??! My food was fine but my boyfriends burger was way undercooked than what he had asked for to the point where he couldn't even eat it making it a complete waste of money. We didn't bother sending it back since we had already waited so long and were just ready to leave. The manager did come over to apologize and offered to give us both cheesecakes on the house, which they ended up forgetting about. Again, after being at the restaurant for almost 3 hours by now, we decided to not wait another 30 minutes for the cheesecake and just paid our bill and left. Pretty disappointed because we always look forward to eating at The Cheesecake Factory but this was a pretty unpleasant experience. Although our waiter and waitress were very nice, and I appreciate the apology, I don't think we will come back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480

I have gone several times in hopes that the service gets better but I'm continuously disappointed. Service is super slow even when it's not busy and the servers just aren't friendly and seem like they hate their job. Went today with a friend around 2, and the experience was enough to convince me never to return to that location again. First of all, it took a long time to even get the free bread Cheesecake Factory provides for all its guests as well, we had to ask for it after about 20 minutes. My friend ordered a classic burger and told me that it didn't taste or appear any different than a burger from Carl's Jr. or Burger King. Quality of food definitely seems to have decreased significantly over the years. Server never came to refill our empty water cups nor did she ask if we wanted to see the dessert menu, which we did. Took about forty minutes to get the food as well. Overall just not an experience worth the time or the price.

The floor managers veronica and jenn need to get it together or let someone else with management abilities be the floor manager because they clearly don't know how to do their job. GET IT TOGETHER CHEESECAKE FACTORY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480
Sahar G.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,36,2,1.0,12/15/2015,This is my first time here and it was the worse experience I've ever had. They sat me down at a table and after 20 minutes of just sitting there I asked someone to take my order and they told me it would be a few minutes and still no one came. I sat down for 35 minutes before someone came to my table. Horrible customer service and horrible food. Will never return again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480
Debra B.,"Venice, CA",1,3,,1.0,12/27/2015,"I guess when you come to TCF you should know what you're getting yourself into. And yes, the food is what you expect. But the service -- from start to finish -- was beyond explanation. From the 80 minute wait (we were told 40), to the repeated asks for a place setting and water, to the staggered arrivals of our food (10 minutes between), to a complete missing order -- the dinner was an unmitigated disaster. It's clearly a mismanaged restaurant. It's big. It's loud. But it doesn't have to be this unpleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480
Elaina And Nai D.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,5,,1.0,11/23/2015,First of all we get there and the hostess was nice said it will be about 30 min wait so that was ok. The thing she gives us buzzes saying our table is ready we go up there and then the male host says to give him a min and stand to the side we wait 5 more mins for him to take us to the table. We get to the table and it is still DIRTY! There were still dirty dishes on the table. He asks us to stand to the side while he cleans it up. (Are you kidding me?) we see an open booth for 4 and we ask if we can just sit there and he said no. Ok? Because it makes sense to have us wait more for you to clean the table that should have been cleaned before you tried to seat us but alright. We order our food and it comes out appetizers are good and then we receive the main course and my aunt asked for extra pasta sauce and my cousins order is just completely wrong to begin with. She asked for the hibachi steak medium rare and got the steak Diane well done. They came back with her correct plate but the steak was also well done. And 15 mins past my aunt has not received her extra pasta sauce. And one of the managers came and helped us correct the meals and it was ok. Then our waitress who by the way was incredibly sweet was telling us she was going on her 10 min break and that Dakota would take our checks once we are done and she did. Our original waitress comes back from her break and Dakota still hasn't brought us back our change. We let it be known that she took 15 mins to give us our change and she talks back to my aunt and then turns around and calls her a b*tch. Really? How unprofessional. And a manager was standing right there and he didn't say anything. I couldn't believe this place. I'm visiting my fam because I'm out of town and my first night here and they legitimately ruined it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480
Kristal M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/11/2016,"Normally every time I go to CheeseCake Factory I always have a great experience, which is why on this extra special day, my Mother in Laws 60th birthday we selected this resturant to celebrate. However the experience was completely ruined by terrible customer service. I am extremely upset and frustrated. Service was great to begin with until I tried to surprise my Mother in Law by getting my server Questa's attention to advise her that we were celebrating a Birthday. I literally had to track her down because I did not want my Mother in Law to know, I wanted it to be a surprise. Once I spotted my server I politely said ""excuse me"", but at that same moment the host interjected and began speaking to her, completely ignored me as I stood there for 5 minutes trying multiple times grab either of their attentions. Once they were done chatting my server walked away. The host then asks me if I needed something and I told her I was trying to get my servers attention. She then asks me if she could help, I informed her today is my Mother in Laws birthday and I was hoping we could surprise her with a birthday dessert. The host said of course and took down her name and advised she would let our server know. Ten minutes pass and we receive the check and we pay for our meals still hopeful that my Mother in Law would be surprised. Ten more minutes pass and we accept the surprise is not going to happen. My mother in law actually thought we FORGOT! As we were leaving I approach my server and ask her why the surprise dessert never came and she advised that she was never informed of my request by the host. She unceremoniously told me that ""sure she could grab something and charge us for it"", I told her no thanks and we left. I was extremely upset and frustrated by the lack of communication, the lack of professionalism when I tried to grab my servers attention and the complete disregard for sympathy I was given when I told my server the situation. It's situations like this that can ruin a customer experience and a 60th Birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480
M N.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,13,,1.0,6/28/2016,"I have two young children and a hectic life, so it takes A LOT for me to take the time to write a bad review.  But I had a such a bad experience on so many levels that I had to.  The first time I came to the restaurant with our friends and their kids I asked if they happen to have coloring sheets or at least a piece of paper to occupy our kids, since almost every family restaurant I've been to has them.  Nothing was available--not even a piece of paper, so the waiter ripped a piece of his notepad to give me.  The second time I went to the Cheesecake Factory I had my phone charged ready to give to my kids.  Unfortunately, not only does TCF not offer WiFi like most restaurants do, but it's actually blocked, so absolutely no internet was available.  That wouldn't have been an issue, except that it took close to 10 minutes to get a server to come to our table, another 15 minutes to get our drinks, and then at least another 45 minutes to an hour to get our food.  Halfway thru the wait, our kids (and ourselves) were out of patience and it became very stressful, because there was no Wifi to distract our hungry kids.  The drink order was incorrect.  We ordered an appetizer that never came.  The meal was incorrect in that one of the dishes didn't have the side-dish it was supposed to come with.  We asked for the bill right away since we were worried it would take another hour to get.  The bill was...you guessed it...incorrect.  They charged us for drinks for the kids even though drinks were included on the kids' meal.  When we got the bill we also pointed out to them that our side dish and appetizer never came.  When they brought the new bill 20 minutes later, they also then brought us that appetizer AND charged us for it.  We never did get the side dish.  At that point we had already finished our meal and didn't want the appetizer.  But we paid the bill, didn't even bother disputing that appetizer, because all we wanted after 2 plus hours there was to get the heck out!!!  Just looked at some of the other reviews and definitely agree about the bad customer service and unwelcoming feel.  From the greeters to the wait staff, to the fact that a huge successful family restaurant does nothing to make families feel accomodated, it just feels like you're bothering them by being there.  All in all, I've had a long history of dining at the Cheesecake Factory, but after this, I think I'm done with the place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480
Amanda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/26/2015,"Tonight my boyfriend and i visited this new location for our first date night in a very long time. The place is gorgeous inside and out we checked out the terrace before being sat inside. The hosts were happy and welcoming talking to us on or way to the table. Our server (Lauren) Greeted us with a huge smile and had drinks and bread out before i even looked up from my menu which was very fast. The menu is huge and i think she could tell i was overwhelmed, she asked if she could assist in any menu questions or suggestions, i gave her my options and she helped me decide that with my love for spice and pasta to get the chipoltle pasta with chicken. It was amazing i found my new favorite dish for the next time i come visit. As well as our delicious desert the oreo cheesecake was to die for. Our date night was amazing Cant wait to come back and visit Lauren and this beautiful location. Thanks again lauren!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480
Priscilla M.,"Rosemead, CA",20,46,27,1.0,11/23/2015,"Wow.. what a horrible night. I was having a good day until the workers here just made it go to crap. Went in thinking I was gonna have a great dinner with my family. Well I thought wrong. Had to wait maybe 20mins when they said it'd be 30mins... got called early and the table wasn't even ready for us to be seated. Waited another 10.. OK. Anyway I looked that over and then our original server was so nice. Well we placed our orders and all and I got the wrong order. I ordered a Hibachi steak with no wasabi. They brought me a steak diane instead..... well done. I like my meat medium rare and it wasn't correct. They brought out my original plate but it was, again, overcooked and cold as hell!! I usually don't complain but I haven't had steak for a long time and I really wanted a nice steak dinner, cooked right. My mom had some pasta and she wanted extra sauce and she waited 20mins for aside of sauce..... we called a manager over to get it resolved and I really appreciated Joe, the manager, for correcting it and personally serving us. He brought back my steak and it was cooked right and it was the right plate... but it was cold too... it's okay I overlooked that as well.... anyway we got through dinner and decided to order dessert. Got our 1st dessert but we waited another 15 mins for a separate one we ordered at the same time! Ok... we overlooked that as well. We let it be.. now... we asked for the check and our server again was great. She let us know she was going to take a 10min break and that DAKOTA would pick up our check and take care of us... DAKOTA came over to pick up the check and we said we needed the change back. Took her 20mins to get us our change. Our original server had been back from break already and asked us if everything was ok and what we were waiting for and we let her know and she went to go look for DAKOTA. Another 10mins... DAKOTA came back from getting change and told my mom she only took 5mins.. at this point we had Joe back at the table since we wanted to leave already to enjoy the rest of the night/beach since we live 2hrs. away... and DAKOTA thought it was a good idea to sass back at MY MOM and started an argument with her!! NO WAY I WOULD LET SOMEONE TALK TO MY MOTHER IN ANY SUCH WAY!!!!!!!! DAKOTA had to be told to not do anything and was walked off by our original server. I was look for DAKOTA so I can speak to her and her manager. I went and followed her around and see maybe I could get her attention. Then I finally got her to see me and in asked her what her name was (I didn't know her name until after) SHE LAUGHED IN MY FACE AND WALKED AWAY WITH A SNOBBY ASS ATTITUDE. OH AND DID I MENTION DAKOTA WAS TALKING TO ANOTHER EMPLOYEE AND CALLED MY MOM A BITCH? YEAH. SO THAT'S WHY I FOLLOWED HER AROUND SO I CAN GET THE MANAGER AND TELL HER. So I got another employees attention and asked her for (Dakota's) her name. At first she said she didn't know and then gave me DAKOTA'S name. I got ANOTHER manager by the name Sara. Told her what happened and she walked to our table and tried to make everything right. No way, after all that mess we wanted NOTHING to do with this location again. I never had had such bad service in my entire life. And I'm a chef btw and I have great customer service skills. I've never encounter such an ugly environment and such bad service.. the managers were nice and said they needed to get rid of TRASH LIKE DAKOTA. She made that very clear. So I hope no one goes through such horrid service like I did and I made that clear to the manager. All in all, a wonderful night wasted we didn't even get to go to the stores in the promenade cause everything was closed by the time we left.. literally wasted 2 1/2 hours and money. Never again will this place get my money or service. So DAKOTA if you see this review or anyone that works here in that manner... GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMERS FIND ANOTHER JOB WHERE YOU STAY ISOLATED FROM THE PUBLIC CAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SERVE OR ACT AROUND PEOPLE. I will be calling corporate tomorrow afternoon to make sure something gets down about this place or their employees. Never again, stay away...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-santa-monica?start=480
