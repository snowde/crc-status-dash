Ron S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",2,139,14,4.0,12/9/2014,"Always dependable. We come here at least a couple times a month after a movie at the Arclight. Waiting times can be anywhere from 15 minutes to 45 minutes when super busy. They give you a beeper to let you know when your table is ready so you can go check out some of the stores or whatever. Service is always great and always friendly. The menu is so extensive that even the most picky of eaters will find something. Everything we've tried has anyways been great. Their chicken and shrimp gumbo is a recent awesome find. Fish and chips with sweet potato fries is a tasty choice to share.  And no doubt the best cheesecake options around. One slice is perfect to share by three people... or at least that's what we do and are always sweet tooth satisfied. Last week I hit a movie solo and then popped in for take-away and ordered dinner for the three of us at home. Getting the order in was quick, easy and done right. It did not take long and everything was ready at which point they checked everything item by item with me to ensure they got it right. It was a first time for take-away and I was impressed. Always a solid choice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=620
N K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",56,128,2,2.0,11/3/2014,Not kid friendly. Server was too friendly... Resulted in very slow service.  Minimal to no veggie options. Surprising.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=620
Jaelynn D.,"North Hills, CA",66,535,331,4.0,2/17/2011,"I mean honestly, what's not to like. They have a huge menu, tons of drinks at the full bar and a WIDE array of cheesecake. Came here for my boyfriend's friend's birthday and they have everything down streamlined. The service and food is always good. The portions are HUGE.  And the Arclight is close by. What more could you want? (Well, I wish there was still a Tower Records in there)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=620
Justin W.,"Los Angeles, CA",495,63,13,1.0,5/11/2012,"When I agree'd to my girlfriend's offer to have dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, I should've realized right there and then that I got a ""Get Out Of Jail Free"" pass to use during any future mishaps I might get myself into with her. THAT'S how bad this place is. The Cheesecake Factory boasts a menu that is large. No, not large. Gigantic. I dont really know how I felt about a place that serves Orange Chicken, Steak Diane, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes, and Chicken Parmeasean under the same roof, but I was willing to give it a try.  When a menu for an establishment is that large, it means it's either featuring a collection of unique items from speciality chefs around the world OR really, really, really bad food with nothing good enough to be a 'featured' item. Unfortunately, Cheesecake factory falls into the latter. When I can't decide what I want to eat at a restaurant I've never frequented before, I usually go straight for the ""What are they famous for"" factor...however I couldn't eat Cheesecake for dinner. Or could I? No. Not in public. According to the menu, their most popular dinner speciality happens to be a combination of Chicken Madiera (their most popular chicken dish), Steak Diane, and Mashed Potatoes. I ordered the steak medium-rare to  be on the safe side but was a little worried when my waitress dropped off a steak knife to our table before my entree arrived.  Last time I checked, Steak Diane was small enough medallions to where you didn't have to cut them with a knife. My Dinner arrived in a timely fashion, however my level of excitement quickly dwindled once I stared down at the disarranged slop of SHIT-ake (looking) mushrooms covering my main course. My steak was on the left, chicken on the right, and the potatoes in the middle.  The Steak: According to the menu the Steak Diane is ""a mix of sirloin medallions, onions, and mushrooms in a mushroom sauce."" There were NO onions in this mess and literally 50-something mushrooms. The sauce was extremely sweet and didn't match what I have grown up to know what Steak Diane was. I was calling the search for my meat The Great Steak Escape, but once I found my little medallions I understood why I was given a steak-knife. This steak (which was supposed to be medium rare) was cooked WELL DONE with a super gritty and fatty texture that was unappetizing and flat out disgusting.  The Chicken: According to the menu, the Chicken Madiera is a piece of a chicken breast covered in asparagus, mozerrella cheese, and a ""madeira"" sauce. First off, I can see where the word MADiera came from, because this meal pissed me off.  The chicken was flattened to the size of a piece of notebook paper, covered in globs of burnt cheese, and (just like my steak) covered in about 50-something mushrooms. The sauce was exactly the same as the steak diane sauce (imagine that!).  The mashed potatoes were made from red potatoes (which I don't care for) but weren't bad. The asparagus was quite good, actually. I don't cause problems at restaurants and never return food because that animal was still killed for a reason, not to be thrown in the garbage. The Cheesecake Factory is a place for middle-class families that want a big selection of things that they might enjoy yet have a backup plan dinner in case they don't. The only thing that gave this place one star was the professionalism of our waiter and the decor of the resturant. There's much better resturants that have $30 entrees, with food you'll actually enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=620
Jessica Y.,"San Francisco, CA",231,223,18,4.0,4/4/2013,"The servers here are some of the friendliest I have ever seen anywhere. 4 stars for easy access: free parking within the mall, and also located at the corner (as opposed to tucked away somewhere obscure) Other than that, this place is pretty much like any other cheesecake factory: American food, salads, soups, desserts, sandwiches abound.  My personal favorites: cranberry kale salad with apples, and portobello fries with garlic aioli Also: GET THE ICED MANGO (basically their mango smoothie). Quite pricey, at ~$7, but absolutely amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=620

Taylor G.,"Los Angeles, CA",270,368,129,4.0,5/19/2012,"Best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that they are consistent. I have never had a bad meal at any of their locations; which inspires me to try different things on the menu. Yes, they all look the same and its a little monotonous as far as design goes but its good food that is moderately priced. Our waiter Zack was very professional and attentive. Great service all around. Today was my first time here in a few years and everyone at the table shared an order of tex mex egg rolls appetizer that is complimented well by salsa and an avocado spread. I had the Thai chicken pasta that was amazing; the peanut sauce on it is a killer along side a blue moon beer. And banana cream cheesecake with real bananas for dessert. All delicious items. One thing I must say is that the portions are huge It is hard to finish a plate of pasta here, you don't want to eat so much that you hate yourself.

I ended up getting a whiskey smash great drink my girlfriend loved it and drank the whole thing.  Our service was on point, very good at letting us talk and not interrupting every 10min to see if we were fine.

Anna M.,"Irvine, CA",13,72,136,4.0,8/3/2014,"We had lunch there on Saturday. I only advice come a bit before afternoon you will save yourself a lot of time. Got seated right away but just  15 minutes later I saw people waiting for a while. In short: Food 5 Stars Menu way to long and confusing, getting 4 menus is ridiculous 3 stars Service 3 Stars Overall: 4 :)      The good news. Most of our food was great. As appetizer we got Ahi Carpaccio and it was amazing. So fresh and yummy with a little avocado and cucumber. It would get it as my meal next time. Avocado rolls are weird tasting ... I am not a big fan of heated avocado. It just losses that creaminess and tastes mushy.   Pit Beef Dip had meat that was perfectly cooked. The only thing I would change, I would not use baguette for it. It is a little too hard even with Au Jus and confused flavors.  Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp was yummy. Keep in mind all portions are huge. They are more than plenty to share. Specially, if you are planning to have some dessert. Disappointing was their healthy Turkey Burger that was lacking in flavor and dry. Our waiter was way too busy to provide good service. He did not seem to care about menu, which is an issue on it's on. As soon as we set down, we got  about 4 or more menus with so many pages and items to look through that we were lost for a long time what we want. I would really recommend getting rid of a lot of items and simplifying their menu. Our waiter also would come to our table and just talk over us vs giving us a second to stop our conversation.   Overall,  a lot of great food that should be shared. Must try Ahi Carpacci",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=620

There was one male server there however who did seem to want to help but at this point, we were not longer willing to wait.  We asked to speak to a manager before walking out and even HE was an airhead! All he said was, ""well we would love to serve you"".... Um, that's not really the right thing to say to customers who are angrily walking out of your restaurant. How about a ""I'm so sorry, please sit and have a meal on us."" Never coming back here again.

After 1 hour wait, we ordered Ahi Tuna and Evelyn's favorite pasta. Both dishes noticeably had small portion of food (probably 40% less) compared to last time.

The food was delicious, even better than Olive Garden. The dishes were big and we could not finished them all. Same goes with the dessert. We had a great time.

So when my dad suggested we take my mom here for a another's Day brunch, I was super excited! We had a reservation for 9:30 and had requested a booth ahead of time, which we were seated in immediately. The brunch menu was on the smaller side (considering the bulk of the menu) but you could order anything off their menu, not just the brunch items. I was pleased with the genuine kindness of the staff, with everyone who came up to our table wishing my mom a happy Mother's Day. I ordered scrambled eggs, which came with a choice of bread, potatoes, and I opted for the ham option. The ham comes on a separate plate so if you want it mixed in you must cut it up and do that yourself but that was perfectly fine with me. My dad ordered the French toast, which was fresh, soft and sweet, absolutely perfect! Lastly my mom ordered the eggs Benedict, which she thoroughly enjoyed.

I like this one its pretty cool, its not as good as the woodland hills location but its good. Only problem i had the other day is for happy hour its suppose to be self seating but i guess they wanted to sit us? well they sat us at a table where either me or my boyfriend couldn't  watch the TV. (first football game) So we moved over to the table next to us so we can sit side by side. After 30 minutes sitting we got our food and the manager comes over and says hey guys i need you to move back to the table we sat you at we need to sit a party of four and walks off. were like okay maybe you guys could've just told us that way before we ordered drinks and food and now you want me to pick up a hot plate and move back to the other table. like this is the only four top seat in the restaurant. i sat for a second and he comes back again and says hey i need you two to move now please. i kindly snapped back and said well we would like help moving our plates over because we don't work here. Overall, i feel like he did not need to do all that especially since we were in happy hour area and we were in the middle of eating. The managers here seem to make poor decisions when it comes to satisfying customers.  Also, another time they allowed a homeless woman to sit down right near us in the bar area and she smelled horrid like urine really bad the couple next to us said they lost their appetite and so did my boyfriend. she was not buying anything and i don't discriminate but this is a restaurant and if she is filthy no telling what germs she could be bringing in while people are sitting right next to her eating. thats extremely unsanitary.

Yum to perfection. I ordered the combination dish of steak and chicken, just the right amount of portions. Service is attentive and friendly.  I went here on a Saturday night and the wait was approximately 40 minutes so we went down to the Townhouse Kitchen & Bar (couple stores down) to grab a few drinks while waiting for the beeper to go off.

Monica B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",7,104,37,2.0,6/11/2012,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory restaurants in various locations over the last few years, but after my most recent experience, I was left wanting something better.  We were there to celebrate a special occasion over lunch. There was about a 20 minute wait and we were seated in a not-so-great part of the restaurant. The music over the speakers was louder than necessary and the environment overall was very loud.  Our server was friendly. The food was unremarkable.  Our meals can be had at other restaurants for a cheaper price and better taste. The cheesecakes we had were just not that special. The server removed a plate from another party seated next to me and took my plate to put the leftovers in a box. She returned to the other party and gave them my leftovers. Hmmmm... I know it was very busy and she probably did not realize what she did. Also, my water glass was empty for too long before it was refilled. I saw another server set the table next to us for the next group of guests, and I didn't recall seeing the table wiped down before the silverware and plates were placed on the table- again, people are in a hurry.  Overall, nothing was that bad about this place, just not special enough to go back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=660
Tiffany H.,"Indianapolis, IN",751,1105,2721,4.0,12/20/2009,"This isn't the first time I've been to cheesecake factory but my family and I tend to come to this one when we go to this area. We have always had pleasant experiences but since I just went yesterday, I might as well write a fresh review :)  Well, the inside, is your typical cheesecake factory and the menu is the same. The only thing that sets this one apart I think is their bathroom. Never have I ever seen such an ugly Cheesecake Factory bathroom. I know it's not relevant to their food but..still c'mon you're cheesecake factory. and PLUS this branch always seems to be VERY popular. We went around 530 and we still had to wait. By the time we were done, the waiting room was FILLED with people. So maybe upgrading your tiny, ugly ugly bathroom would be nice.  Our server was AWESOME though. Charles, an African American man, was super animated. He seemed like he genuinely tried with his manager when we found out the cheesecake factory deal that says with every  $30 purchase, you get a free cheesecake wasn't applicable on Fri&Saturday. Oh well, the red velvet cheesecake was pretty good. However, I think cheesecake factory's original cheesecake is the best. The layer of cream cheese frosting is too intense and takes away from the overall taste.  I had the crabcake sandwich for the first time there. It was delicious! My family and I also tried the chicken bellagio for the first time also. It was very delicious too.  Cheesecake factory usually never disappoints, just don't look at their nutritional facts. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=700
Brian B.,"Los Angeles, CA",226,352,80,1.0,3/27/2011,"Oh where to begin, where to begin. Ok here, we'll start here. I was forced to eat here. It was a surprise going away gathering and I was responsible only for making sure that the guest of honor arrived on time and at the right location. The guest of honor asked me a few times where we were going and I had to keep telling them that it was a secret because if they knew we were going to Cheesecake Factory they would know something was up because they know me and they know I wouldn't pick this restaurant for the dining pleasures of the two of us.  The surprise went well, but that was really all that went well. The 20 minute wait turned into nearly an hour. Once the pager went off even the hostess tried to make a joke about the wait to lighten the mood and apologized. Appreciate the effort. We were seated and spent almost exactly enough time to get situated and open our menu before the manager came over and asked the entire party of 6 to move from a table to a smaller booth. Really? We waited an hour for your hostess to put us at the 'wrong' table? Thanks. Now this next blip on the radar was out of the control of the restaurant because the fire alarm went off. No biggie, maybe a kid pulled it, maybe there's a fire, maybe it's a test. Maybe our server could have come by the table and told us what was going on, like if we needed to leave, or be worried, of if the restaurant turned into a strobe filled disco at 8:00. Nope, after enough time to get a headache from the noise and lights and ask each other questions like one of us was in on a prank we were able to flag down a server since ours was no where to be seen, maybe she evacuated, what was going on. At this point I was ready to leave and hadn't been for the group we would have. So service gets a big fat ZERO. Food, well the wheat bread was good, but that's easy to do. I've had a few things at a few different CCF locations and I can never remember what I had the last time because I don't frequent the place often. I decided that Garlic Noodles sounded good. I was spoiled by the Garlic Noodles at Crustacean which are heaven, which I don't believe in, in a friggin bowl. The flavorless noodles at Cheesecake Factory are why I now believe in a hell. My friend asked me the simple question, ""Did Crustacean ruin garlic noodles for you and are you being a food snob and not giving CheeseCake a fair chance because Crustacean has the best Garlic Noodles ever?"" My response was simple and honest. ""No! Crustacean did not ruin all other garlic noodles, CheeseCake Factory ruined theirs all by themselves."" I go to the ArcLight all the time and we pass CheeseCake Factory and in a pinch would have eaten there before a movie. That's no longer an option.  The only thing, ONLY thing I will enter this place for is a slice of cheesecake TOGO. So there's the positive in the review, I will eat their cheesecake and take it to go.

Like some of the other reviews said, this place can get PACKED!  I called ahead of time to make reservations, and they would not allow it.  Typically, if you have a party of under 3 people, they can seat you fast.  Otherwise, if you are coming during 'rush hour', plan on waiting a bit.  As with most places, outdoor seating is usually first available.  They have a heated patio on nights when it gets chilly, so if you bring a jacket, outside is usually quite lovely. The only other reason this place is four stars instead of five is because of their pricing.  Not to say it's not totally worth it -- because lord knows their food and desserts are AMAZING -- but $3.50 for a coke is a bit silly in my eyes.

My brother had a hard time deciding what to get and asked the server about a dish. The server said absolutely not and recommended a similar kind of dish that he assured my bro he would like. So my brother went with his suggestion. He LOVED it!! He said the food was crazy good.  There are different things that can make an experience. At a chain like Cheesecake, service is a big factor.

Blerime T.,"North Hollywood, CA",14,32,4,2.0,1/7/2015,"Came in for lunch and received a rude introduction by the host - after giving us a buzzer we waited ten minutes, got buzzed and returned only to be told we needed to wait (another 10 minutes) because the table wasn't clean and ready. When I asked why they didn't just buzz is when it was ready so we didn't have to stand around at the host's front desk, his response was ""I can't see through walls."" He has runners to tell him when tables are ready and they don't tell him everything was the next excuse when I asked how he then knew to buzz me? He told me ""well they don't tell me EVERYTHING.""  Apparently he can't see his eventual unemployment check looming not too far in the distance either. Major attitude as I asked if his response made sense to him considering he could simply have asks his runners. No apology for the wait, just a nasty smirk. Spoke to the manager to ask if he thought this response was appropriate - nice enough guy. He said, "" I'll talk to him."" No follow up. No offer of even a complimentary ice tea. Service was slow but pleasant, thankfully. Food was decent. My mom had a hamburger, cooked as ordered with good sweet potato fries. The crab artichoke dip was sub-par. When we left we asked for a validation for parking. Unfortunately, the validation didn't read and we got charged $19 for put parking.

When we first sat down it had a nice cozy feel to it, and the lighting made it even better. It took some time to get a waiter over, but he was very friendly when approaching us. We ordered a chicken salad sandwich, jambalaya, and some edamame. Our drinks were an oreo shake, raspberry tea, and a water. Now, due to it being very busy and having experience in the food industry, I expected it to take some time for our order, but it took an unusual amount of time for the bread to come to our table, it took about two times of us asking our waiter for bread until we finally received it. However, like everyone has always told me, the food was remarkable, lots of flavor. My overall experience with the restaurant was a big A+. I know the restaurant can't control this, but the only reason it wasn't as good as it could have been was the child in the booth across from ours that was screaming his lungs out.

Sonny D.,"Los Angeles, CA",309,364,34,3.0,8/21/2008,"What you need to know before eating here! This is from the persepective of someone who currently works there (unless someone from corporate reads this, gets their panties in a wad and makes my life difficult). Just want to give some useful tips going in that might make your experience better.  1)There is almost always a wait at night, espeically on Friday and Saturdays. Please come prepared. You can always score a seat at the bar with no wait but that only pertains to the bar top itself and the high top tables in the bar (meaning the 5 tables in the middle of the bar that separate the bar from the half booths.) The high top tables will be dirty, so please be patient as it takes time to clean. 2) Some people aren't aware that you can substitute *certain* side dishes on your plate for other items at no additional charge.  Make sure you ask before, as one a few items cannot be done or carry a small additional charge.  3) Smoking is no longer allowed on the patio, state law.  4) Speaking of laws, you must have a current United States government issued I.D. to order alcoholic beverages. It's the law people, sorry.  5) If you have a movie to catch, make sure you tell your server as they will do their best to meet that need.  6) Parking is  validated but only a receipt can be given as proof you ate there if you left it in the car.  7) During lunch the validation is only 2 hours, meaning after that is up parking cost 1.20 every 15 minutes.  8) There is only one soup per day, don't think they hide others from ya. 9) Water is no longer automatic because of a new California state law. Simply ask.  10) There is no printed kids menu, but there are kids items. Just ask. And those were 10 things!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=840

Yosub K.,"Brooklyn, NY",276,264,5,3.0,3/1/2009,"Cheesecake factory is up and down. I guess it all boils down to your server. There are some places where you don't really need to care for the waiter, like Claim Jumper. Why? I don't know. But this place, you need to depend on your waiter because of the bread. You need them to fill up your bread when it is depleted and your energy source has vanished in the span of 3 seconds. The pastas are okay, but the orange chicken is great. It is quite Americanized but who cares? It tastes good.

Amy L.,"San Francisco, CA",2,10,11,2.0,11/29/2013,"This is my first time writing a yelp review because my waiter was just that bad.  I ate at plenty of Cheesecake factory with more customers waiting in line for seats. In fact, when my server was bringing my bf and me to our table, there were so many tables open. We waited for 40 minutes for just a table for 2. Anyways, when I got to my table, I checked my plate and utensils. My plate had dried out green onion like substances stuck on it. My spoon had unwashed dishwasher soap accumulated at the dip of the spoon. My forks had bread crumbs hanging. I was appalled. When I called my waiter ALLEN over, he saw the dirty dish and utensils and took them before I could even complain. That was how bad and dirty they were. He could see them at a further distance in the dim lit room. Then he comes with my new dish and utensils and guess what??? The forks had bread crumbs hanging from them AGAIN! So I called him over and was made sure I held the fork up. I said, ""There's bread crumbs on this fork again. May you get me a new one"" and he quickly took it and slip it into his apron pocket without saying sorry or an explanation. Now I'm wondering how clean any of their dishes really are; especially the ones they serve their pasta on. Anyways, this random female waiter came with our food and she forgot the cheese so she didn't even offer us any cheese. I had to search for ALLEN for 10 minutes and ask for cheese. My pasta dish was already mildly cold when I got it at my table so it was cold when I finally got my cheese. The bread and my dish were very delicious. I was satisfied with my dishes :)  ALLEN was going around the tables making sure everything was okay and he saw us just sitting there waiting for dessert or for the check. He skipped the table next to us who were complaining and my table and disappeared off for another 20 minutes. My boyfriend had to stop him when he came back around to tell him we're done. We were nothing but respectful saying thank you for his service throughout the night so there was no reason for his continued sucky service. When he collected our plates and gave us the cheesecake menu, I didn't even acknowledged his presence and didn't say thank you. He didn't deserve it. I usually tip extremely well, but that was the first time I gave only a $3 tip from my usual $10 tip.

It was delightful, but a slice of green apple would have made it even better. I love chewing on those. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and it arrived with the chicken delightfully crispy with the breadcrumb coating, topped with prociutto and an arugala salad, while sitting on a big mound of pasta with pesto. Could have used a bit more pesto.  I ate about half and had a lunch from the leftovers the next day.  My friend had a Vodka Gimlet - nice (I tasted it) and spaghetti with meat sauce... ehh, but she wanted ""comfort food.""  Huge portions, if that's what you're in to. P.S. We chose the patio seating because we could see the people going in and out. I noticed that there was an incredible array of major hunks coming in with gym bags... seems there's a 24-Hour Fitness upstairs. A little eye candy before dinner.

Amanda S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1157,471,2110,5.0,10/6/2008,"Alright, alright. I hate reviewing chain restaurants and i've especially avoided reviewing Cheesecake just because it's such a cliche middle class fake upscale restaurant. But! It is delicious and i don't know anyone who will really deny that. And this is by farrrrrr my favorite location. And it deserves more than 3.5 stars in my opinion. Most of the people who don't like coming here just don't like it because it's not what i'd consider a 'bargain' and looking through the menu is like reading a novel that you flip back and forth in to re-read some sections. Annoyinggg. Not for me though. I have literally tried most of the menu and while everything is delicious, i stick to a few select things. 1. My favorite, the Herb Crusted Salmon Salad. Delicious. 2. Club Sandwhich. their applewood smoked bacon is the best in the world. i'm positive. 3. Chinese Chicken Salad. the plum vinaigrette is so good. 4. Chicken Piccata. the list sort of goes on, but it's much less extensive than their entire menu haha. their eggs benedict is actually pretty good, as are their omelettes. I wish they had hashbrowns though :[ But who can say no to the fresh baked wheat and sourdough bread they give you? I can say no to the sourdough, but definitely not the wheat. I could live off that shit. their lemonade is also a must. It's too strong for some people, but i'm not some people. I eat lemons by themselves all the time (i know, i know, it's bad for your teeth. I've cut back, don't worry). But their lemonade is the closest thing to a lemon as it gets. Mmmmmm. :) Anyway. I could probably write a couple pages about how i'm always satisfied when i come here (which is every single Sunday of every single week. Never fails.)  I also met Steven Speilberg and the entire cast of House and Gossip girls, amongst others. Not that cool, but whatever.

Christine P.,"Tucson, AZ",77,12,,4.0,5/7/2012,"Before this weekend, I'd never been to Cheesecake Factory (yes, seriously!), although I've always heard great things. We went for my best friend's birthday celebration with some of her family. We went in and asked for a table for 9, and agreed to first available. The man at the counter was about to give us a buzzer, but one of his associates told him not to, that they could do a table that size right then. They got our table ready and not 5 minutes later led us to it. The party arrived at kind of a trickling pace, and they were very polite, asking each person what they wanted to drink as they arrived, and bringing us fresh bread baskets more than once. Speaking of the bread, I'm not crazy about the white bread, but the brown bread was...addicting. We polished it off almost as soon as it touched the table. Our initial waitress went on break, and had a waiter named Stephen help her out while she was gone. He was hilarious, friendly, and I actually liked him better than the first woman.  I ordered a raspberry lemonade to drink, which came with a margarita-like rim of sugar around the top of the glass. This stuff is great. And with free refills, I drank so much of it before my meal! For the meal I ordered a Skinnylicious Veggie Burger without mayo...not because I was watching my calories, but because it came without cheese, which I don't eat, and it was $1.00 cheaper. It came with a green salad, since it IS Skinnylicious, but I substituted Sweet Potato Fries. The only time I DIDN'T love the service is when I was getting ready to eat but realized there was no mustard at the table and no waiters in sight! After a decent amount of time trying to find and catch the attention of our waiter, my friend's aunt called over a random employee and asked him to bring some spicy mustard. He didn't speak very good English, and brought over regular mustard, but then after we clarified, he brought over some Grey Poupon and I was able to dig in. YUM YUM YUM! The sweet potato fries were cooked to perfection...in fact, some of the best I've ever had. The burger was visually appealing as well as tasty. It was made of various vegetables and grains, and contained beets, which gave it a nice deep magenta color. I was unfortunately so full of lemonade and bread by the time I got my meal that I had to bring a lot of my burger home for dinner, which was STILL good several hours later. I did, however, finish my fries, because fries are never good the next day so I have a thing about eating them all at once! I was SO impressed by this place, from the service to the food, and heard good things from the people I was with about their food, appetizers, drinks, and dessert. It didn't hurt that at a later point in our meal, we realized there was a celebrity sitting two tables away. This place isn't the cheapest, but I will be returning whenever I feel like splurging...or whenever someone else wants to pay for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=820

We all know the food is just okay and you'll have leftovers to take home for lunch.  The Vanilla Bean cheesecake was absolutely delicious, but I couldn't finish that either.

I ordered the garlic noodles and there was NO garlic flavor to be found in the spaghettini which unfortunately, they gave me spaghetti.  Arrgh!  The asparagus and shitake mushrooms were okay in it.   There is one appetizer I do like which is the avocado eggrolls.  Unfortunately, this CF didn't deep fry them enough so the wrapper was a bit on the raw side.  Ick.   The Steakhouse salad (poorly named as it has no steak- but we knew this when we ordered it) was actually really good.  I would call it more of a caprese salad with extra lettuce (it reminded me a bit of how Casa Bianca in Eagle Rock serves theirs).  It was way garlic-y (good thing since my garlic noodles turned out to be ungarlicy!). Someone please tell me what their CF favorites are because I'm knocking the garlic noodles down.  Way down into the  ""best not go there again"" file.  Although, no, I pray I never have to go to a CF again.  Yes, that's it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=860

Cheesecake Factory is like any other average restaurant chain. But for heaven's sake, I'm ordering a salad. You don't even have to cook it. Just make sure the ingredients are fresh, because that's the whole point of salad: light and fresh. I ordered the tuna tataki salad with avocado, tomatoes and wasabi. Unlike other Cheesecake Factories where I've had it and licked my fingers afterwards, the salad in this particular restaurant was NOT fresh at all. They got the cheesecake (seasonal Pumpkin) right, though. But then again, they better if their name is The Cheesecake Factory!

If you ask me, I would NEVER allow my employees to ""sport sunglasses"" in the patio area of a restaurant. If he had sensitive eyes...he should have been working INSIDE! Not to mention MY server...we were one of the first customers on the patio for lunch (we stood outside the doors waiting for them to open mind you) and my half salad and small cup of soup took forever! And because I have eyes and ears everywhere...I overheard the server tell one of her other customers...""Your Arnold Palmer is coming out right now."" 3 times!

Sarah S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",9,27,,4.0,11/6/2009,"""Try the Red Velvet Cheesecake"" a wise person recently told me. Living in SLO of course I had to wait til I came down to the valley, and thus I did for the next couple of days. I was with a friend and cousin and were all craving their complimentary bread basket given in the beginning. Indeed as soon as we got seated moments later our server introduces himself and immedietly asks what we wanted to drink and gives us the heavenly bread. I swear I can eat the pumpernickel (brown bread- not wheat) or chocolate bread as I like to call it. It was frehly baked! omg, to die for. Crazy me coyly asks for a second basket knowing it was a death trap but I didn't care. We started off with appetizers, buffulo blasts and onion rings. A pluses for me. I ordered their herb crusted Salmon dish. While waiting for my food we agreed to each get a slice of a cheescake no matter how full we were. Our dishes came and we dug in, yummy my salmon was fresh, and you can tell as it sat on this lemon flavored sauce. Mashed potatoes were delish and the asparagus were the right consistency. My cousin got the spicy chicken pasta and I took a bite and it was actually spicy, yum! Halfway through my meal I couldn't help but think of my cheesecake that's about to come..  Red Velvet Cheesecake. I love cheesecake, I love red velvet cake..put them together= heaven! It was flat out one of the best, if not the best cheesecake I have ever tried! And of course I took advantage of the other two cheesecakes on the table. 30th anniversary cheesecake and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake! Chocolater lovers, beware as they were both amazing. I swear one of the buttons on my shirt was about to pop open and I literally couldn't move but no, I still kept eating.

We told him the hostess said it was open and he said No. You have to leave.  We called the Manager who basically threw the hostess under the bus and said she made the mistake but we still had to leave.

In Florida it is OK to like Cheesecake Factory because there are no other options. However, in LA this should be the LAST PLACE you would ever go to. Food is overpriced and under par for quality.  ""Sizable portions"" is an understatement. They overload you on the food. But only on cheap food, like mashed potatoes, french fries or chicken.  I ordered the Tuna Tatake Salad (at $16!) and I got 4 pieces of Tuna.... NOT HAPPY! I only order the Tuna Salad there because with the forced Calorie Menu, I could not bear to order anything else. A veggie burger is 1270 calories, while the Mac and Cheese buger (holy heart attack!) came in at around 1300 calories. It just doesn't make sense. BTW, I only came here bc my friend had a gift certificate... just to clarify. He ordered the French Toast- cool, 10 huge pieces of French Toast and that's it.... boring. BF got the Shepard's Pie lunch special which was actually pretty delicious and fairly priced. Overall, save your wallet and your waist size for much better cuisine in LA.

I come here because I expect to eat one meal and have enough to take home for lunch tomorrow. Whew (I'm rubbing my distended belly.) Cheesecake Factory has long been a dependable favorite. I have cravings for the sweet brown bread flecked with oat which I can only satisfy there. Today I was especially ravenous and inhaled 3 warm buttered slices. Mmmm so good. I've had quite a number of items from its extensive menu over my lifetime, and today I was yet again surprised by the new ""special menu."" I thought I was going to order an oldy but goody, Cajun Jambalaya or the BBQ Chicken Salad, but the Chicken Bellagio pasta ($12.95) tempted me. Thin breaded chicken (so that it had a nice crisp when you bite it) sat atop basil pesto (redundant I know) spaghetti noodles. On top of the 2 large thin chicken patties was a sizable sheet of prosciutto with arugula leaves raining upon them all. Honestly, it was very good. It's not a difficult dish to make by any means, but it was hearty and filling, and the slight bitters complemented the salted meat and the tender chicken. I love the textures you get to experience. Mmmm. And of course, I had leftovers to enjoy the next day. Since I felt like treating myself, I caved to a slice of cheesecake too. I was torn between the carrot cake (which I've had and is very good) and a cheesecake of sorts (e.g. tiramisu, key lime). I came across a Carrot Cake Cheesecake... and I thought, it's perfectly meant for me! So I gave it a shot. It definitely is carrotcake swirled with cheesecake, cream cheese icing and patted down with almond slice. It was decadent. I liked it but I do think I will have to stick to one or the other going forward.

Still giving her the benefit of the doubt, we waited. 10 mins after having been seated, I got up and asked another waiter if we could have silverware and it was brought to the table right away.  Now, about 15 minutes had passed since our waitress took our drink order and she still hadn't returned to take our food order.  I get thats it is friday night and its busy, but she had passed by us and assisted surrounding tables several times and never once said to us something like ""I'll be right over"" or ""I'm sorry, give me another minute"".  So after waiting 15 minutes, I got up to ask the front if they could have our waitress take our order. She then came to our table. She took the order and didn't even acknowledge the fact our table had been forgotten about.  After that, it died down and she was on her game though.  Another waiter started assisting her tables. I dunno if she was over whelmed or what.

Maybe I just get lucky when I go, maybe they recognize me, maybe they heard a ""yelper"" was in the building lol, I don't know...but the fact is, this time our service was extremely speedy, the food was great, ""I had a shrimp and bacon style sandwhich, something new on their menu, don't even know if it's a regular thing, but it tasted great"", and was given extra bacon free of charge because I simply said when they asked how everything was, that it felt light on the bacon...2 minutes later, he came by with a plate with 6 strips of bacon...MORE than enough, and didn't tell me he was doing it :) both myself and the girls I was with were extremely pleased with our meals.  The bill for all 3 of us combined with a few drinks, came out around $70, not bad at all.  Everything was clean, and it was speedy too ""granted it was 4:30pm on a tuesday. My bottom line is I left extremely satisfied and definitely recommend this location.

It was very delicious and the salmon was cooked a little crispy - but we like it that way. The brown rice was soaked in what tasted like coconut milk! Yum! My boyfriend and I shared the chicken Madeira. For desert we ordered a slice of Tiramisu cheesecake and Oreo cheesecake.  Both very delicious and the slices came in big portions so we were able to take the rest home !

Came here for a birthday beginning of Dec. The usual business.... parked in the structure, walked in, waited 25 minutes to be seated. Nothing I didn't expect. Once seated our server came by. I felt like we didn't click right away... She just seemed distant, only wanted to take the order and walk away. We asked for bread several times. Had to wait for water refills. but the thing that REALLY pissed me off was that she offered the table next to me fresh Parmesan cheese for their pasta... but I wasn't offered any (I ORDERED PASTA!) When I tried to get her attention, she ignored me... Not cool... Also, when I told her it was a birthday, she said we can either buy a slice of cheesecake OR get a small sundae on the house... I asked a reasonable question ""Can we get both?""... which seemed to stump her. She left to go ask someone... It was the weirdest thing.

We we're seated outside and it was HOT. However, the outside chairs were so comfortable that we obliged and stayed, lol. Our server was chill. She wasn't overly friendly but she gave the perfect amount of attentiveness. We noticed both of our entrees were less salty than usual but we weren't complaining. Actually, this is good for our health since we like to pour hot sauce on everything. Who needs the extra salt? Not us! It could've just been that night however if this is an issue for you, you can always just ask for salt! (Speaking of, why do they not keep salt + pepper on each table?) cmon son, this is standard.

Mary S.,"San Francisco, CA",130,68,10,2.0,5/17/2011,"What do food poisoning, a horrible waiter, and crappy food all have in common? CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! Now I'm not actually saying that all Cheesecake Factories are bad. I've actually been to a few that I really enjoyed. But the one in Sherman Oaks is the worst! It began when I arrived with a group of about 8 and we had to wait 45 minutes for a table at 10pm at night. We finally sat down and when our waiter found out that two people in our party worked at a different CF he proceeded to ignore us the rest of the night (assuming that our friends would take over his duties). When he was asked if we could get the employee discount he said he would check with his manager and let us know, but he said that it should be fine. He took our order and disappeared. Everyone's food came out at different times including a pizza that didn't arrive for almost 20 minutes past everyone else's food (which was now getting cold). I ordered the hummus and it was horrible. Bits of raw garlic in there that gave it a pungent taste. The waiter arrived at the very end to hand us our check and then informed us that we wouldn't be getting the discount. We figured out our bill, gave him our cards, and then waited 30 more minutes to get them back. We signed (had to pay automatic gratuity even though the service was horrible) and got the hell out of there. If you really love Cheesecake Factory food, then I suggest getting it to go and skip the hassle of crappy service. Oh, and both of my roommates got food poisoning that night.

When before it was theme based and added something special to the visit. I guess now that there are so many of them, it seems to have something lacking.  Don't get me wrong, the portions are good and the food remains decent but maybe it's the prices. $7 for a piece of cheesecake is getting to be a little high. (and I'm not one to look at cost when it comes to that) but come on, with the economy getting worse you would think they would avoid adding cost.

Cheesecake factory is good food at a decent price and you wont be leaving hungry. I tend to complain about the service. Especially at Sherman Oaks....I think I have ordered a Turkey Club there possibly as much as 50 times over the past 2 or 3 years and always order it..No Mayo..No Tomato. Not that hard to understand.

James-Tiberius S.,"Salinas, CA",7,34,,4.0,5/31/2007,"Came here w/ my sister.  She had the kobe burger, I had the meatloaf.  I'm not normally a meatloaf guy, nor do I go to CF primarily for the food, it's all about the cheesecake.  But good call sis w/ the meatloaf recommendation.  The balsamic vinaigrette w/ the table-bread was a nice touch.  I also factored in the truly tremendous service - Jeanette, if you weren't married we'd be in Vegas tonight (that is if you like chubby white guys).  The wait was surprisingly brief too, despite us coming during primetime.  They gave the usual good-sized food portions (so I got 2 meals out of it).  Decor was nothing memorable, but this was the first ground-level CF I've visited. Overall, a positive experience, hence the surprising 4-star rating. Meal Memory:  1st off, cudos to the management for putting that small (& somehow stylish) trash can right by the exit door in the corridor leading out of the bathroom.  Per my OCD, I usually use toweling to touch the door-handles as I leave, & that little trash can saved me from the oft impressive gymnastics routine I normally have to do to swing that door open, bolt over to the trash bin to toss the toweling (or hold that door w/ my foot), and then dive a la Indiana Jones through the closing bathroom door (it's for this very reason that, unlike Indy, I rarely wear a hat. Though I do tend to carry a whip ... for other reasons I suppose). It's a particular pain when there's a separate corridor you have to exit apart from the bathroom area.  Anyway, having that little can there all by its lonesome was definitely sweet & much appreciated.  In retrospect, I suppose I should be alarmed that this made such an impression on me (at what point do I become a danger to myself, or to others?). 2nd thing, during the brief wait to be seated, we checked out other stuff in the immediate area & I saw a spectacular & posh El Torrito.  That's right, a decked-out El Torrito (hostess confirmed, w/ a rather sheepish smile, that it was part of the chain).  They'd doubled the price of the entire menu (I guess to match the decor) & the staff were all young well-dressed hotties.  I just had to laugh & think now I'd seen everything.  It does give me hope that, somewhere out there, there's an In N Out Burger overlooking the Pacific, where the patrons sit on mounds of cushions surrounded by post-modern art, order off a gold-leaf menu, and the staff are all models (w/ attitudes to match).  Yes friends, maybe mythical El Dorado does exist.  In fact, maybe all those ancient legends do not actually refer to El Dorado, but to El Torrito.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=920

It smelled awful, I tasted it and it tasted like dirt and grit, like something that should have been cleaned, WASN'T!! I send it back, they bring another, I didn't taste it this time because it smelled better. Get it home and much later heat it, sit down and with just the light from the TV I can see that the shrimp were filthy front and back, and by filthy I mean Completely FULL of shit!!!  For any eating place this is astronomically  unacceptable.  This isn't, oh I didn't like how it tastes. This crap could have made me seriously ill and I mean more than the extreme nausea that I'm feeling today at the thought of the food I did eat there which was also a shrimp dish.

That said, I don't like chain restaurants.  But last night I was faced with a date night with my hungry wife who'd had a terrible day, and needed an activity we could do in the cold, ie. dinner and movie with the option to skip the movie if we got tired and wanted to go home and watch TV instead (that's what ended up happening).  Upon reuniting after work, we realized that if we were to stay in the valley (she was too tired to spend an hour driving to the city an back), our options for a nice place to eat were SO limited!  Where could we go?  Pinot Bistro, but we'd been there.  There's minibar, but we'd been there, too, and I liked it but she didn't that much.  I thought of Katsu-Ya, where I haven't been, but my wife loves it, but she said I'm no fun to eat sushi with because we don't share (she keeps kosher, I prefer my fish cooked).  We'd heard about a placed called Max, that could work, but wasn't near a theatre.  We really were stuck.  What to do?  This realization that there are literally next to NO nice places in the valley was kind of dumbfounding.  I mean, there are places that people go.  But then, people go to Universal Citywalk, too, and that's totally inexplicable to me.  There just aren't any places like Luques, AOC, Craft, Providence, Bastide, Ortolan, Nook, Wilshire...the list could go on forever.  There aren't even any pseudo-good hipster restaurants like Geisha House, or any of those places in Hollywood.  I don't get it! Suffice to say, after not being able to figure out a nice place, I suggested the Cheesecake Factory downstairs from the movie theatre, and there we drove.  I mean, if we HAVE to go to a chain, at least we knew they'd serve decent food and good portions.  So, it ended up being exactly what we thought it would be, although there wasn't anything playing at the theatre that we wanted to see, so we just went home.  Ah, well...it is what it is, right?

First of all, I had to ask the waitress to bring us some bread. She was not attentive at all. Second, the food was bad. What a waste of $12! I ordered the turkey burger expecting a gourmet burger with alot of flavor. I was very disappointed. I wasn't even sure if it was turkey meat! The burger was falling apart and I had to eat it with a fork. It was very unappetizing!  To top it off the fries were overcooked and dry! I've had better fries at McDonald's!

E H.,"Panorama City, CA",3,4,,2.0,2/24/2012,"Last Friday at around 1:00 in the afternoon my friend and I decided to head to CCF to get some lunch and have a few cocktails. we ask the lady if we can have a booth somewhere a little quiet The waitress takes us to the back of the restaurant by the bathroom presenting us to a table. across from it in all its glory was a quiet booth next to the window for a party of two. We asked to be sat at that table. After about 15-20 mins a cute little Mediterranean girl came to our table to take our drink orders I asked the waitress if they carried Ciroc vodka and she didn't know, my friend asked if they had cotton candy martinis, she didn't know that either, but she did offer to go check with the bartender, we gave her alternative drinks if they didn't carry what we preferred I ordered belvedere and pineapple juice and my friend had a patron ultimate margarita. 15-20 mins later she returned empty handed to get the same drinks ordered in the alternative stage of the first visit. I asked for some crab bites as well as some crab wontons. The cute little waitress disappeared for what seems like hours to return again empty handed (no drinks, no bread) to take our food orders. I asked for some bread and water please. She said okay sure, ill get that for you and then again she disappeared for like another 30 mins before she brighten my day again with her smile and my drinks (SARCASM SARCASM) so around the fourth round the food comes, we ask for more hot fresh bread and cuteness (waitress) (SARCASM) smiles and says I will get that right out to you guys... well again she disappears for about 20 mins before returning and saying that the bread will take an additional 7 minutes because it was in the oven.. OK we said and continued to have a good time... Ok this is where it all goes downhill... We ask her to wrap this food up so we can get out and enjoy this sunny Friday afternoon. She wraps up everything and returns with the check... The check is roughly about $100.00 (CRUMBS compared to what my Boo-Thang and I spend on Sundays) we look over the check, drop off $120.00 cash, pick up our belongings and proceed to take the 15 min hike from the restaurant to the car... laughing and being merry the whole way. We are literally seconds from the elevator (in fact just past starbucks) when we hear some African American girl screaming excuse me, excuse me, we never stop to see whom she screaming for because it has nothing to do with us... but this NOISE is getting LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER, CLOSER CLOSER CLOSER ... BOOOOOM (this chick was coming for us) she runs right up to us and says (verbatim)  EXCUSE ME LADIES (SARCASTICALLY) YOUR CHECK WAS $91.94 (EXACTLY) AND YOU ONLY LEFT... she open the bill fold and counts out right in my FREAKING FACE RIGHT HERE IN THE FREAKING COURTYARD $120.00 CASH. Then this sweet little African American girl (SARCASM) finds her indoor voice and says I apologize we didn't count the money right, thank you and disappears back to the CCF. Standing there holding my mouth in my hand because I am SOOOOOOOOOOO Appalled at what just happened, my homegirl and I looked at each other and said... we should have asked her for our freaking $28.00 tip back... I told my homegirl I am calling the restaurant to complain as sooon as we get to my house. Get home get settled, called the restaurant and spoke with the manager I forgot her name seeing as she was so helpful, sweet and attentative (SARCASM SARCASM SARCASM) I won't even go into detail about that phone call because it was even more appalling that the girl accosting us in the courtyard.... Ill wrap this up seeing as I have already dragged this story out and imp beating this horse dead for life... I ended up calling there corporate headquarters and speaking with a lady by the name of Colleen.... Oh what a TRUE GEM... (I really mean that) She was everything that I needed to feel better about the experience (FOR REALS)not only was she just as appalled as I was about the experience. She was sweet, apologetic, attentive, ready to please... she listened to me with great concern, she was not dismissive like the restaurant manager. She assured me that she would for sure make up for the bad experience and too looks for something sweet in my mail box... So I am looking forward to that!  I said all this to say... I work in the medical field and I always try to execute the same customer service I would want back, so shockingly I was at my own job on Tuesday 02/21/2012 when I had a new patient, the patient filled out his paper work and proceeded in to see the doctor, after he was seen by the doctor the chart comes to me for billing and coding..

Kathy Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",721,126,686,4.0,12/27/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location was my childhood favorite. The wait was 45-75 minutes, even back then, and we'd walk around Tower Records to kill time. Side note: RIP, Tower Records. In addition to a sourdough bread binge, I would order the chicken potstickers, children's pasta (bowties with just butter!) and the chocolate mousse cheesecake... every time. Don't fix what isn't broken, amIright? Well, years and years later, the Cheesecake Factory is still standing and still delivering delicious food. The wait is either terrible or nonexistent, and I haven't yet figured that part out. Sunday brunch isn't crowded, though, so there's that. Nowadays, I'm still binging on sourdough bread. I've since moved on to the Pasta Da Vinci -- hold the onions, swap out the chicken for extra mushrooms. I'll also order an appetizer of some sort -- perhaps the chicken potstickers, quesadilla, avocado egg rolls(!) or fried calamari.  They didn't have the ""small plates"" section way back when, and those are delicious... but quite small. Loaded baked potato tots, crispy crab bites, and ahi tartare are my picks. They are small, though, and not quite worthy of sharing. I always save room for dessert whenever possible, but I usually end up taking it home. The cheesecake varieties have boomed (as have the prices) and I've fallen in love with something new every so often. I recommend the dulce de leche caramel, the caramel pecan turtle, the salted caramel, the white chocolate raspberry truffle, or the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake... Notice a pattern? ;)  Note: The cheesecakes are VERY sweet and VERY rich. I can't take in that much sugar in one sitting, so I recommend sharing and taking the slice home. The restaurant validates, so don't forget to turn over your ticket to the server.

Food: Definitely go with the Avocado Rolls and Fried Calamari for your starters, and they also serve up two types of bread + butter for the table. Their main courses are usually very good, my favorite dish is definitely the Da Vinci Pasta because the sauce is SO tasty- the chicken is usually a little dry though so I recommend subbing for shrimp. My most recent trip I ordered the steak tacos- I was with a large party and I know they like to bring out food all together- but my steak was cold, like just made It out of the fridge, cold. Their Chinese Chicken Salad is really good too, big portion, I would ask for half the dressing or dressing on the side.

It literally just hung out there in the ceiling lighting area just crawling around. What can you do? It disappeared for a while (probably to the kitchen for a snack) and the manager came by and gave us this whole story about ""construction"" above them creating this ""issue,"" suggesting that they aren't ground level, e.g., in the kitchen (getting a snack). He told us everything was on him today, so I ordered a third drink, knowing I wasn't going to be able to eat my food when it arrives. THEN THE GIANT RAT RETURNED...apparently it couldn't get enough of the dining area and it just hung out there, right above peoples heads and PLATES.

Becky B.,"Burbank, CA",7,105,354,3.0,11/26/2017,"We only came here because we had a gift card sitting around for about a year. We've been to this location before, and it's always good-tasting food, but trying to get healthy options can be super-loaded with sodium. Service was okay, there was a bit of mayhem at the front hostess station, and they didn't seem to have a handle on the waiting crowd. We ordered a lot of small plates and the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich. The stuffed mushrooms were okay. There was a beef broth style of sauce at the bottom of the pan, and it was mostly salt-based. The avocado egg rolls were very mediocre. I was hoping for a bit more seasoning or a textural difference inside, but it was pretty much just bland avocado. I did see small bits of red onion, but there was no taste evidence of it. The crunchy chicken samosas were probably the most unexpectedly tasty option out of all the small plates. The grilled cheese strips are not worth it. Save your money and make it at home. Literally, it's just a grilled cheese sandwich (no fancy cheese or anything) with bacon in it. The spicy buffalo chicken sandwich rocked! The buffalo sauce was a bit sporadic, but the piece of fried chicken was huge and gorgeously crispy. We were getting a bit full when we dove into the sandwich, so we opted to take off the bun, and honestly, it was better with the bun off! The bread added nothing to the sandwich. Overall, if you're in the area, and the other ""higher end"" eatery in the area (used to be one chain of Mexican cuisine, but as of last weekend, a new place was going in), this might be something for you.

Nikki K.,"Los Angeles, CA",998,100,225,5.0,1/30/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night during the dinner rush and we really wanted some cheesecake, so we decided to endure the 45 minute wait. Let me start off by saying that I commend the hostesses and hosts that handle the front line of the chaos of this restaurant. They were all extremely pleasant and had smiles on their faces, even when the mob of hungry angry customers asked when their tables would be ready every 10 minutes.  Since we had a lot of time to decide what we wanted to eat, we asked our waitress if we could order as soon as we were seated. The four cheese pasta and BBQ burger w sweet potato fries were delicious. My boyfriend and I agreed that the fries were the best that we ever had because they were cooked just right and tasted hot & fresh (I forgot to take pictures of our food because we were so hungry and dug in as soon as the food came haha). We also ordered the Hazlenut Crunch and Cherry cheesecakes to go and those were delicious (as always).  Our server, Elisabeth, was excellent! She was so sweet and very attentive. She always made sure our water glasses were full and asked if we were doing okay. The quality of the food and service was well worth the wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=20
Lavetta C.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",76,3,,1.0,1/13/2018,"Just had THE WORST experience at the Ventura Blvd location. I ordered the ""slim Steak Medallion "" meal - one I've had many times and they literally gave me 3(maybe 4) small pieces of steak with an even smaller amount of asparagus. What it did have most of was - potatoes. Because since it's measured on the weight according to the smug and incredibly in helpful manager (tall, blonde woman). All for the price of close to $20!!! Like most people, I want to get the most out of a meal for the best price and $20 for 3-4 chunks of beef is not. I will NEVER visit this location again. I'm a responsible person who rarely writes negative reviews but being treated in such a dismissive manner after many years of patronage is a ""deal breaker!""

I got the four cheese pasta and it honestly tasted like there was only one cheese...the big dollop of ricotta on top of the plate. I also tried the guacamole and it tasted like it came out of a container. There were bits of overripe avocado that was brown and mushy, definitely offputting.  I would've given 2 stars if it wasn't for our waitress, Heather. As a family of 6, we're usually a handful but Heather was so attentive and so genuine!!

Wait time was 30-35 minutes. As we waited for our other two friends to arrive, they called us to be seated. Our waiter was...well he did attend to us pretty decent. Although he was not having it with my friends jokes, I guess because we know him we thought he was funny. Our waiter did not, he kinda snapped back at him with a smart ass answer, but I get it lol. Food? I ordered the spaghetti & meatballs ($16.50). Now usually when I go to Cheesecake Factory I only go for the Chicken Costoletta ($16.95), but since I wanted some pasta, I ordered the spaghetti. It had flavor, however the meatballs were pretty darn tough. Either the cooks over worked the meatballs OR they were frozen meatballs. Either way the meatballs were tough, not even a knife was able to cut through them. My friends ordered the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad (one gluten-free) and that damn salad was delicious! Not to mention the Pineapple Moscow Mule ($11) and the Godiva Flourless Cake...yum!

Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,7/3/2017,"So we had a business meeting in the area and we chose Cheesecake Factory again due to my last visit in Brea.  That was really good.  However, if this was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory, it would be my last. I was thinking to myself, 'how can this be part of the same chain'?  Everything was so different.  The service was terrible, the food was bad, the overall experience was just plain dreadful. We arrived upon opening to avoid the crowds.  Ordered the Fried Zucchini as an appetizer.  I was telling everyone that these would be the best they ever had.  This was based on my last visit in Brea.  Boy, was I wrong and embarrassed!  The Fried Zucchini was the blandest, plain undercooked Fried Zucchini I have ever had.  I had egg on my face and my friends let me know it.  Embarrassing to say the least. The salad as ordered came out just the opposite and had to be sent back twice!  How difficult is it to order a salad and get it right the first time? We ordered our Entree's and again, such a letdown.  The pasta was stone cold and the chicken was lukewarm at best.  Again, I raved about the Pesto Pasta and had it substituted for the normal item, again, I should not have done it.  It was just a terrible dish. In regard to service, our waiter came to us and said he was taking his lunch and the place just opened up.  We were told another server would be helping him.  Guess what, I had to go get more napkins, I had to go ask for more water, I had to go get more silverware, I had to get more condiments.  This was the worst service I have ever experienced!!  People just dumped us and forgot about us. How can two different establishments be so dramatically different?  It is called 'a lack of QA' at the Sherman Oak's facility at all levels.  I really was embarrassed and had to eat crow all day from my friends for a poor choice.  I really would like to know how it was so bad and different.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=20

When it comes to the food, you can never go wrong with their avocado eggrolls as an appetizer. Also, I recently tried their tuna tartare, which had great flavor for a small portion. For my entree I like to get the tuna tataki salad, which is light and healthy but also flavorful. If I'm really hungry, I sometimes go for the Hibachi steak with mashed potatoes, which is a huge portion, or other times I get the Jambalaya which is spicy and delicious.

My partner checked us in and while the wait was not long before our paging contraption started vibrating, we still waited about an additional 10 minutes inside after returning the device. So their logic is, you go inside, return he device and then they generate a little tag that is put in order for a hostess to then take and seat you. I think it just would make better sense to call you in when the hostess is ready to seat you.  Anyways, once we were seated our waitress took our drink and splitter order relatively quickly. First she brought out their amazingly delicious bread, then brought our our spinach artichoke dip and drinks. So, I am not a huge fan of this dip in general and found this one to be fine. My two monsters and partner loved it, so there you go. We ordered a steak and salmon combo plate, blackened chicken and shrimp and for the monsters chicken Alfredo and grilled veggies.

So i question it to the manager and his response  you've only been waiting 9 minutes ( yet I pointed out that they have been waiting for 1 minute and were seated.) he was basically if you don't like it too bad. This guy is either full of himself with his power trip or on something because normal people don't get close to your face like that and act that way. Update add fuel to the fire, they sat us outside 90% of the heaters were not working, and the wind picked up. I asked how long now for an inside table they said we would need to start over, so another 40 min wth! We sat outside, and the manager comes over to say I don't understand why your upset you got a table! Ya in 50 degrees outside no heaters thanks  Update .... here we are 30 minutes after we ordered.... just got my iced tea and no food yet  WORST EXPERIENCE EVER !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=40
Jeremy M.,"Van Nuys, CA",88,37,20,2.0,12/25/2017,"I am a frequent patron of many locations of the cheesecake factory throughout the Los Angeles area and I was wondering if there is any possible way to improve the hostess/seating issues at the Sherman Oaks location. The wait times at this locations are outrageous compared to other (more crowded) locations in LA [20+ minutes often times in non-peak hours] and the tables given to me are always the smallest ones in the restaurant. I often speak with the host, the manager, I even attempt to bribe the host for a better seat but they seem very unenthusiastic to help find a table that is not in the busiest, loudest location and smallest table available. Asking for a booth or larger table results in even longer wait times. I never have this issue when visiting locations in Canoga Park or Thousand Oaks - two locations I also visit frequently. I just do not enjoy having the host treat me as if I am bothering them when I arrive and that they are doing me a favor by finding a [terrible] table for me. Anytime I arrive at the location and there is a wait time I just instantly choose another place to eat in the area, as I know I will not have a good experience at that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=40

Timur G.,"York, Toronto, Canada",101,16,65,3.0,2/20/2017,"Actual review 2.5 We went here after the recommendation from our friend who is a regular here.  We ordered appetizers and were gonna wait for them to come before we ordered the mains, this was a mistake since it took like 30 minutes. But we though its okay since it was busy, the food took a while too.  The food was ordered as medium well, and even though in the middle it was medium well the outer layer of the meat was char burned on almost all of the dishes, making the meat taste super dry. Our friend that's a regular always orders the same thing and said his food tasted off as well as the appetizers. He talked to the manager and he said that they got new chefs so that might have been the problem. The waiters were pretty apologetic and said they got a lot of complaints that's day.

We were sitting there waiting for attention, attempting to make eye contact because we wanted to box up our food. However a former (or current) employee in street clothes walked up to the bar and received all the attention. Two bartenders and a barback, servers walking by and chatting it up while he was getting free bread. Seriously? I get that they're your friend, but we're paying customers and we were ignored for a bit. If we come back to the theater, we'll pop in here if there is no/a short wait.

It took her nearly 30 minutes to even bother asking if we would like to order an appetizer and no matter how hard we tried to flag her down she just was not coming back to our table.  Finally I asked a manager for help and he was so busy laughing it up with the other guy in a tie that I honestly don't think he bothered doing a thing.  The last person to order got her food first and sat there with it while the rest of us hadn't even gotten an appetizer yet. Then everything else came at once.

Andrew D.,"Los Angeles, CA",138,142,176,4.0,6/4/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has it's ""ups and downs"". While the food itself is fantastic (I have yet to try anything here that I don't find absolutely delicious), the cheesecakes, shockingly, are just ""mediocre at its best"".        I have tried the ""Chocolate Mousse"", it was ""ok"". I have tried the ""Snicker Bar Cheesecake"", also just ""ok"". ""Hershey's"", just ok, you get the idea... The cheesecakes are just generic in taste. Maybe I am just a dessert snob, but something is definitely lacking in the flavor. Sometimes they're passable, and sometimes they altogether disappoint. From my experience, I deem the downfall to be the cheesecake base itself. I can never taste the cheesecake creaminess of these desserts, even though they are cheesecakes. The consistency is just lacking, unfortunately. Oh well, can't win them all.       I will give praise where it's deserved though; the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake is a sweet lover's dream. From the chocolate truffle topping, to the caramel pecan coating, and the brownie crust, this one is meant for the books. Also, any of the other ""specialty desserts"" are pretty spot on. Linda's Fudge Cake, Chocolate Tower Cake, and any chocolate cake in general will put you in a gut busting, sugar coma for hours.     Now, for the food. I have ventured out from something as ""health oriented"" as ""The Glam Veggie Burger"" to the heartier entrees like, yes, you know it...the pastas! All great, especially the ones drowning in rich, cheeses sauces (to my recollection as it has been years since my last, cheese heavy pasta here). Recently, I tried the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"" and was blown away. The flavors, the variety of crisp veggies, the sauce itself, will have you wanting to finish the entire plate bite after bite, but you won't be able to. No need to mention this as it is ""The Cheesecake Factory"", but you definitely get your buck's worth in food. So much food! Leftovers!    Service is great considering how mainstream and packed this place gets on weekends and even some weeknights. So, all in all, I recommend The Cheesecake Factory for a nice meal out with friends whether you're looking to socialize, get your drink and greasy munch on, or even for something more formal like a birthday dinner or what not. My recommendation; come early or make reservations (assuming this is an option) if you want to avoid the daunt of waiting (another well known down side to this chain).

Ordered Alfredo, Spinach dip, Crab Wontons, Fried Mac and Cheese and Louisiana chicken. order went smooth then I ask the waitress for more bread.  She brought back 5 loafs of bread and I said ""wow thats a lot of bread"" then she replied "" You look like  you are very hungry"" Not sure if she was referring to my extra sized body or if she just meant I was hungry.    After this point I never saw that waitress again.  We got our food and we finished eating.  Waited for 30 minutes for someone to pass by so I can get the check and no one came. So I decided to call the resturant. I dialed the number and I can see the girl at the front desk looking at the ringing phone. Had to call her twice so she can answer and she picked up on the last ring. I informed her about my table needing a check and there is no waitress, she said ""She will get there""  10 minutes went by and no one came, So I called her again, she did it again and didn't answer till the last ring, looking at the phone doing nothing else the whole time.  She again stated that the waitress will be coming. I told her I had been watching her and that she did not make any calls or pick up a walkie talkie and I asked her for her manager.

Breezee E.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,22,4,4.0,12/18/2016,"I love The Cheesecake Factory.  Yes.  I love it.  Their giant portions make for plentiful and delicious leftovers.  Their lemon drop martinis are strong and better than most.  The decor is consistent and comforting.  And the brown/wheat bread before the meal is addictive.  That is my review of The Cheesecake Factory chain as a whole.   As far as the Sherman Oaks location goes, it's pretty decent I guess.  It doesn't have the scenery that Marina Del Rey and Redondo Beach have.  But it has convenience if you are coupling your meal with a trip to the movies at the Arclight or to DSW for a new pair of shoes.   I'm not a fan at all of the Galleria.  The layout is stupid, and you have to walk through a wind tunnel and a journey to get from your car to the stores (unless you pay $20 to valet your car, which is almost actually worth it).   This isn't The Cheesecake Factory's fault though so I won't remove stars for that.   I do need to deduct a star for their bar though.  As mentioned, the lemon drop martinis are bomb.  Everything else is inconsistent at this location, depending on who is bartending.  On a good day they make a strong and flavorful mai tai.  On a couple of occasions it has been quite weak though, and when I asked them to strengthen it up a bit, they charged me $10 for an additional shot.  An extra $10 to make it the way you were supposed to make it in the first place.   Same experience with their Cadillac Margaritas.   Overall, I'm a fan.

Lea Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,108,5,2.0,5/27/2017,"4 stars for food quality and large menu selection but 2 stars for service.  Simply awful hostess team.  But we had a fantastic server who helped make up for it. 3 hostesses were working the reception area last night at about 7:45PM when we exited ArcLight Sherman Oaks and made our way to the restaurant to grab a bit to eat.  THREE.  We waited for them to help the two parties ahead of us and then stepped up to the counter to ask for a table for two.  We waited almost 5 minutes for even ONE of the THREE hostesses to say hello, welcome us to the restaurant and tell us it would be a moment.  No acknowledgment whatsoever.  I was a hostess for several years at various establishments.  The number one rule:  make guests feel welcome.  Even if it's just to say ""Hi, give us a few moments and we'll take care of you.""  We didn't even get a simple ""hello"".  When the girl finally acknowledged our presence (she was wearing a necklace that said something like ""Marcela""), she simply said ""How many?""  Again, no hello or greeting or ""sorry for the wait"", just ""how many?"".  We said ""2 please"" and she responded ""inside or outside.""  We said we'd take the first available and she said ""then we can seat you now.""  Great!  Without a word to us, she handed two menus to another hostess and said something so we thought we were going to the table.  She said ""not you - another party.""  This girl was like the Terminator - barely spoke full sentences.  OK, so we stepped back.  Sorry, we thought when she said ""we can seat you now"" that actually meant ""now"".  Nope.  Waited only a few moments or so and then a hostess called our name.  We approached and this girl who had previously been behind the reception desk not acknowledging our presence for five minutes upon arrival flashes a lovely smile and says ""Hi there, let me show you to your table.""  It was like a totally different person.  That lovely smile would have gone a long way when we arrived. This is a teaching moment folks -- if you work in the customer service industry, how about saying hello and welcoming your customers to your business?  It's a nice way to make them feel good and even if there's a wait to be seated, just give some kind of acknowledgment.  Even a friendly smile and holing your finger up to indicate ""one moment"" would be sufficient.  We felt like we were bothering them by even being there.   At the end of the day it's not that big of a deal in the whole scheme of life so I'm wondering why I just wrote three paragraphs about it.  LOL!  I guess it's just a small, simple thing that would go a long way towards making guests feel welcome in your establishment.  If anyone's reading this - maybe teach your hostess team some basic manners and the fundamentals of human interaction.  It would make coming to your restaurant so much more pleasurable. BTW, the food was great as always and our server was OUTSTANDING.  I wish I remembered his name.  He had a wonderful personality, knew the menu inside and out and was helpful, kind and fun.  So good job on the server staff!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=140

Phil R.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,17,1,2.0,7/22/2017,"This is a review of a specific dish at the Cheesecake Factory, not a review of the restaurant.  On a recent visit, my dining companion and I both ordered Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta. The menu description is ""Large Shrimp Sauteed with Tomatoes, Lemon, Garlic, Herbs and Fresh Basil on Top of Angel Hair Pasta with a Touch of Marinara Sauce"" Overall impression: lacking in flavor...we both thought the dish needed something to make it tastier..the server offered Parmesan cheese which helped a little, but the dish was just under flavored. Perhaps not enough garlic, basil and lemon.  The dish was basically a lot of fresh tomatoes with some shrimp and angel hair There were four or five medium to large sized shrimp on the dish.. However, they were a little tough and lacking in a lot of flavor. Frozen? perhaps...I'm surprised given the volume of shrimp served at the Cheesecake Factory.  I would have to say that my rating for this dish barely gets to average. My advice is to pick something else unless you are really looking for a bland dish heavy on tomatoes.  In comparison, bang-bang chicken and shrimp, one of my favorite dishes on the menu is bursting with flavor and rates very high in my book. (Order it with angel hair instead of rice).

Every time I use the ladies room I regret not going before getting to restaurant. It seems that no one attends to it; there is more toilet paper on the floors than on the holders they belong in. The same goes for the paper towels. Usually the trash is so full that the floor and counters are coated with used papers. It amazes me how messy women can be-my boyfriend said the men's room is not nearly this bad!! Hopefully this will draw attention to the lack of cleanliness. The food is amazing-most times. Twice I have left unsatisfied and both times have been here. One time was a Cobb salad, which seems hard to mess up... I asked for no tomato so they seemed to overcompensate with eggs, the chicken and avocado both had right portions, but under the eggs I went on a scavenger hunt for a few bits of bacon, and even less blue cheese. It was end of the night so I think I got what scraps were left. The worst experience, however was when my entree didn't arrive until my boyfriend had finished his. We ordered an appetizer, and when it arrived placed our entree order. The appetizer came out without the dressing we asked for, and our server seemed annoyed she had to make another trip. Boyfriend got Jambalaya and I went with my favorite-the Chicken Madeira with no mushrooms. Someone different brought the entrees and my plate had mushrooms. I politely mentioned that I told our server no mushrooms and this server took it back. About 6-8 minutes later I convinced my boyfriend to eat so his doesn't get cold. Our server returned to try and correct me by saying I told her no onions-yes, she came to tell me I had said no onions on a meal that doesn't have onions. Pretty appalling she felt the need to argue with a customer (and she was not just unprofessional, also wrong).  My boyfriend finished every last bite before my entree arrived (in the hands of someone else mind you). I asked for a to go box and the manager. He seemed a little embarrassed and apologized for the mishap as well as the unprofessional comments from server. Not the most pleasant experience... Most recent time was a delivery, and was missing bread and cheesecake. Not the end of the world about the bread (although we did request it) but we paid for the cake. The manager was cold when I asked for a solution. I wasn't trying to get anything free, I just wanted what I paid for to be fixed! Go to the Woodland Hills location-you will not be disappointed!!

Stina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",410,204,347,3.0,3/30/2016,"I'm not sure why I'm even reviewing Cheesecake Factory-- by now, most people have visited it before? I remember when the chain first opened and I loved coming here, but now it's just alright. There are certainly better options, but Cheesecake Factory is always a safe choice. They have a huge menu, with pastas, burritos, burgers-- you name it. The cheesecake selection is also extensive, as you could probably tell by the name-- so this place is great for cheesecake lovers. I came to this Sherman Oaks Galleria location about a week ago with my coworker and a mutual friend for dinner. I just parked in the shopping plaza's parking structure.... make sure to validate your ticket! It cost $1 with validation.  We came on Wednesday night around 6:30pm and didn't have to wait. It definitely gets more packed throughout the night. I ordered my usual -- the Farfalle with Chicken and Garlic (Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce). The entrees are pretty pricey (I think mine was $16-17) but the portions are huge and I had enough for my dinner and 2 lunches. The pasta is tasty, but definitely on the fattier/heavy side. It's also super garlic-y. This is my go-to item, but I probably will try something else next time. The pasta was drenched in oil after I reheated the leftovers..yuck.  I also got the banana cream cheesecake to-go, which was about $8. So expensive!! I could buy an entire pie at Marie Callendar's for that price. Lol.

This isn't the first time my friend and I were treated so poorly here, we gave it a second chance, which confirmed us never returning to this location again. We came here at 9:20 pm with ample time to order and eat comfortably, our waitress was rude, full of attitude, why even bother taking our order? It's not like we ordered appetizers.... Our bill was close to $80. We were done eating and she never bothered to remove our empty dishes from the table, (no big deal, I get it, she's busy helping and clearing everyone else's table), clearly nor busy enough to bring our tab, but still leaves all our dishes in front of us.  My friend and I are looking over our bill, the waitress returns wanting the check (it's 10:21 pm now), we apologize and say we're not ready yet. At 10:25 pm she sends a different waiter to our table asking for the check, my friend asks him why he was asking for the check and his words were ""the waitress is leaving and she wants the check back""   My friend just signs quickly and hands him the check.  Should you not offer to validate parking like every other Cheesecake Factory does? Wow!  Why be rude?  Why send someone else to do your job?  Really? The restaurant is still full of people and you are kicking us out? Poor customer service Clearly, we won't be returning here again. Not worth the money for such awful experience.

So, then we opted to come here because we were both very hungry. We waited possibly 10 minutes to be seated, which is really good for dinner time. When we sat down, our waiter promptly asked for our drink order and if we wanted any bread. Of course we said YES to bread, but we requested only the wheat bread which is our favorite. I also ordered the loaded tots as an appetizer and our entrees, which were the lemon herb chicken and the BBQ Ranch Chicken salad. The loaded tots came out first and it was something nice to munch one while waiting for our food. Unfortunately, we waited close to 40 minutes for our food and it wasn't even super busy or the weekend BUT when we finally did get our food the portion of my salad was HUGE and my boyfriend's chicken entree was very flavorful.

Michele K.,"Northridge, CA",36,66,33,2.0,10/19/2016,"They were not having a very good day today, at least in the patio. There were four of us celebrating Bosses' Day, albeit two days late. First of all, the waiter didn't write down our orders, which resulted in a bacon-bacon ""cheeseless"" cheeseburger and a side of fries instead of the salad as ordered, I remember her specifically telling the waiter ""hold the American cheese."" But where's the cheddar?  The mushroom burger also arrived cheeseless. Again, she told the waiter, ""no fontina cheese, Swiss cheese only.""  Both burgers were reportedly cold and had to be sent back and fixed. Not surprising, the order took almost an hour. First two of us got our food, then Person 3 (bacon-bacon cheeseburger) and finally Person 4 (mushroom burger). Sorry, but should you not serve everyone at approximately the same time? Don't let people sit there and let their food get cold(er), politely waiting for the rest of the group to be served!  Maybe part of the problem was that we seemed to have about 4 servers.  My chopped salad from the Skinny-licious menu was nearly tasteless. I guess you can't have great taste with only 590 calories. In fairness, the beginning bread was delicious, the guest of honor's chicken piccata looked good, and my Coke Zero was perfect.  Rather than skimp too much on the tip, we decided I'd write the less-than stellar review on behalf of the group.

Chris H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,2.0,3/6/2017,"So, to stat out with, I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I've had great meals / experiences, but this was not one of them. Two problems, and how management handled them are at issue here. First, my family I were taken by the host to be seated, only to find that the table was not ready. No biggie, except the restaurant was very crowded and we were asked to wait at an awkward drink station in the middle of the room, with servers rushing all around us while we waited. Well, after about four or five minutes, they finally get the table cleared. As we're being led back by the host to the table, the manager steps in and seats another couple. Our host tried to explain that we'd been on our way to being seated for the past six or seven minutes, but this manager refused to here it. Instead, he yelled at a bus boy to quickly clear another table for us. Now the manager didn't acknowledge us. He could have apologized of the inconvenience, but he didn't. We were led to another spot to stand, this time by the bathrooms. Here's were the first problem intersects the second. As we're waiting outside the bathrooms, in an awkward placement that basically puts us in front of another family table, we begin to smell something AWFUL. My wife looks down, and sees that the floor is covered in feces. And the trail of sh*t leads back to the men's bathroom. So someone lets the servers know, and they get a guy to come and start cleaning the floors. Of course, we're checking our shoes, trying to dodge around the ""brown footprints"", when another server shows up and seats ANOTHER couple at the table we've been waiting for - AGAIN! At this point, we've had our table delayed or given away three times, we've been standing in the restaurant over 12 minutes, and there's sh*t all over our shoes. Luckily, our host this time demands we be seated, and we are - right next to the bathrooms. Somebody arrived and sprayed air freshener on the floor, so the odor went from poop, to vanilla and poop. Look, I'm understanding, and didn't raise a ruckus though I could have. We ate our meal and left, but I am disappointed in the manner the management treated us. They should have taken us back to the waiting area instead of standing us in various spots. He (the manager who took our first table away) should have apologized instead of ignoring us. They (the staff) should have done a better job cleaning the floors and offering guests near the smell (it wasn't just us who were suffering) accommodations or the chance to sit somewhere else. If any supervisors from the Cheesecake Factory read this, please train your managers and employees to handle these situations better. This will be the final time we visit your Sherman Oaks location. edit: Our visit took place on Saturday, March 4th, 2017, around 6pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=160

When I approached her to ask about the status of my order (since she gave me no number/pager and didn't ask my name), she just shook her head at me and said ""Nope.

I could tell she was embarrassed, she said, ""if it helps, I've never seen that happen before."" I was embarrassed, for a moment I thought she was insinuating that we had something to do with it, but I'd like to believe she was as embarrassed as we were. The manager came over and offered to seat us somewhere else, but we decided to stay because I didn't want to cause a commotion after all the place was really busy. We decided to get a desert after the meal, and Marisela, gave it us on the house which I really appreciated.

The have a huge menu and a skinny menu to give healthier options.  Recently we went here for my birthday and we sat outside. I love sitting on the patio under the heaters. The food was delicious as always. I like the appetizers, a lot of them. The macaroni and cheese balls, lake salad, corn fritters just to name a few.  The cheesecake  I ordered was so good. It was the new s'mores  one. It had chocolate, marshmallows, and graham cracker crust.  My one complaint about this place is they don't take reservations at night time. When I ask the manager why he said because we don't have to. I thought that really sucked for customers. That night we waited almost 2 hours for a table because we couldn't make reservations. It was my birthday and we were a big group.  And ""they don't need to""...that's why they make people wait around for hours!

My dad had the Chicken Bellagio and I had a taste of it, it was so delicious and tasty. The coffee got a lot of praise from my best friend and it was very good.

Shushanik P.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,37,,5.0,5/12/2016,"I don't know where and how to start my review. I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in almost a year and a half. I used to go there quite often in the past with family and friends. Due to financial reasons I stopped eating out most of the time.  On May the 2nd 2016, I happened to be in the area and I was starving. I decided to go there since I was close to the shopping center. I walked in and there was no wait, there usually is a long wait, but since it was kind of late on a Monday, no holidays or special events....so I was seated within 5 minutes. There comes a cheerful lady....my server Marisela with a confident, pleasant, nice, professional, and knowledge attitude to take my order. I kid you not, I thought she has been working there for years. That's how good she knew her job, but yet, I found out that she has been there for only 2 months. WOW!!! Shout out to Marisela:)) I ordered their Steak Diane Salmon Combo that came with asparagus and a little House Salad with ranch dressing. My meal tasted DELICIOUS!! DIVINE!! Not to mention that I was hungry the whole entire day.  I was taking small bites, because I didn't want my food to finish:) that's how good it tasted. Marisela kept checking back with me to find out how I was doing and refilled my soft drink twice and asked if I needed any more bread and butter. She was just WONDERFUL in every way and made my dining experience EXCEPTIONAL! I wish almost all restaurants can have great service like Cheesecake Factory does. After I was done with my meal, she asked if I wanted to have dessert, but I refused her offer since I was soooo full. Now, people whoever has had their cheesecake you know how goooooood it is, but I had no room for it. I paid my tab and left her more than 20% tip, because she deserved it!!  I left to go to the bathroom and I didn't like what I saw, the bathroom was not very clean and they had a small roll of toilet paper. However I am NOT going to take down one of my stars, just because of that. I hope the staff will be more on top of their maintenance in the restroom.  Beautiful restaurant, comfortable, setting/lighting, good food, nice music, clean atmosphere and that is all I can say for now.

That lactose intolerant, gluten sensitive, vegan Auntie that doesn't like cheese or pepper- even SHE can have a 4 course meal at the Cheesecake Factory! Their prices range from ridiculously cheap to ""not cheap but worth it"" so eating out doesn't have to break the bank. The atmosphere ranges well too; feel like having a drink with the girls? The loungey bar area is nice and the bartender still knows how to open a bottle of champagne or make a slippery nipple shot.  On the flip side, if you're looking for a restaurant that's baby friendly, they always seem to have a stroller friendly table in an area where other kids are louder than yours... so no one even notices when your kid starts singing Elmo songs. The food is great.  I think out of the last 100 times I've eaten here, only 1.5 times have I had to send my food back for a correction.   The cheesecake....oh the cheesecake.  So many to choose from!!! I am seriously infatuated with the Reese's cheesecake here, that their carrot cheesecake...and the red velvet...and the crazy chocolate cake....and the....list goes on.  So good!

Brian S.,"Winnetka, CA",0,586,137,2.0,6/22/2015,"The family desired ""just regular American food"" for a Father's day celebration and since we were in Sherman Oaks The Cheesecake Factory was the place. The menu is so comprehensive that there is a large ranged of offerings - ""regular American"" as well as dishes inspired by Italy, Mexico, and Asia. Something for everyone! There are aspects of The Cheesecake Factory that seem to open them to ridicule often, and those are true at this outlet too: no reservations, long and uncomfortable wait, very odd ""secondary wait"" after the buzzer buzzes, and spotty service when first seated. Fortunately our wait was not long. Once getting past that we had a nice table on the front patio. Our waitress was sweet and efficient. The food was good... actually, very good... as always. But I almost didn't stay past the first two minutes at the table. My eating utensils, nicely wrapped in a cloth napkin, still had food from the previous user. So did the replacement set... and so did my bread dish. I as totally grossed out at that point. Then I started noticing the significant number of waiters/bus staff with out-of-control hair - both head hair and facial hair. Eeeewwww... and combined with dirty shirts on two of the gentlemen it made me wonder why the management would have them wearing white polo shirts, or didn't ask them to change into clean ones. This Cheesecake Factory seems to have some problems with sanitation... and, yes, I do believe that the water is so hot and the sanitizer is so effective that the utensils/dishes are sanitary.. but residual food on them is still disgusting. For me that transformed a nice family celebration into an hour of trying to repress retching while also trying to enjoy the otherwise decent food.  Had it not been for the sanitation issues, this would have been a 4-star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=200

Jevonah K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",108,89,152,3.0,12/23/2016,"My boyfriend celebrated his birthday here tuesday evening. We were a group of 8 and got to cheesecake factory around 8pm. We waited for a table about an hour and got seated outside. It was a cold day but the heaters kept us comfortable. The lighting is terrible outside and we couldn't see out menus at all. We had to use our phones to see. Our server Danny was nice and friendly and greeted us right away. He told us there was no more wheat bread which was terrible news as I love that bread more than life. We all ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees pretty close to each other as it was late and we were hungry but Danny said he would put the appetizers in first so we would get it before our meals. I went to the restroom while waiting to eat. It was easy to find and not far but the water was way too hot! My hands turned red from it. I complained about it and was told that the water was approved by some company or something and that it couldn't be altered to a cooler temperature. I walked back to my table and noticed all the other tables had wheat bread and I was angry that we were told it was all gone. I found some ready to be served and grabbed it and took it to my table. When Danny later asked me about the bread asking where I got it I told him ""I found it."" He laughed it off but didn't offer me any explanation. Our food arrived shortly after and I complained that we hadn't gotten our appetizers yet and told Danny to just forget bringing it as we were already served our meals. He told us he was sorry and offered them on the house. We all ate quickly as they were closing around 11 and we were the last ones there.

Luckily Cheesecake Factory was open because I was craving the gumbo. I arrived and sat at the bar where I was greeted by two awesome bartenders. Desmond and Jason. They instantly made me feel welcomed and went out of there way to provide me with anything I needed. Truest hospitality professionals. The Mai tais were strong and the gumbo was delicious.

Lauren S.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,37,7,1.0,4/2/2016,"We have eaten at Cheesecake Factory for 20 plus years and I've come to the conclusion that this place is completely sub par, with terrible and non existent service with low quality food.  1) I don't know who the managers are and who they are hiring but everyone is rude and no one smiles. You wait forever only to be greeted by an annoyed server with zero personality. This has been our experience frequently. Tonight was the last straw. Our server messed up our order, gave an attitude, threw an incorrect replacement at us and proceeded to talk shit about us at the server station so loud my 9 year old said ""mommy she's talking about us."" The manager was completely useless, insincere, and made a sad apology to make up for the humiliation- um sorry that did not cut it. The restaurant is so busy that the staff doesn't have to try to be nice or keep customers. No one cares.  2) You can never find anyone- if you are missing something from your meal or even need a glass of water, good luck flagging down a server even though there are 100s of staff whizzing by. 3) I find all the food to be mediocre at best. And the cheesecake in my opinion is disgusting. It's so cloyingly sweet, and mixed with so many ingredients it's hard to even call it cheesecake. Blech.

Scott B.,"Canyon Country, CA",538,980,3113,2.0,4/27/2015,"So I just experienced the Cheesecake Factory. Schoolteacher and I had an adventure that landed us somewhat kind of around this area. Remembering that I had been given a gift certificate from my father, I suggested we visit for lunch. We parked in the nearby structure, and walked through the mall over to the place.     After giving the hostess our name, I stuffed the vibrating buzzer thingy into my back pocket, and we discussed our adventures. The place was quite noisy, and the cacophony of the crowds of people waiting for entry into the restaurant, as well as nearby diners made it quite difficult to hear the buzzers alert. However, after some time, I jumped as my left ass-cheek felt the vibrating buzzer informing us that our table was ready. Excited, I returned to the hostess stand, and hostess girl took the buzzer, and said somebody will get you . There we waited for another ten or so minutes. Standing awkwardly in front of the hostess booth before somebody eventually came to get us.      We were led by somebody around the crowded labyrinthian pathways through the throng of tables and eventually seated at a table of our own. I was reminded of those people who work at county fair parking lots, fitting one car right next to another, doing their best to save as much space as possible so they can cram as many cars as they can into a field. We had a couple about a foot our left, and a mother and young daughter about a foot to our right. As we sat down, both couples looked up at us, smiled and politely nodded to us before returning to their personal devices.       Another lengthy wait, and another person came over with menus, introduced himself and took our beverage orders. Person took off and disappeared for some time. Knowing that there would probably be a desert round, I eventually settled upon the Renee's Special, which had some soup, some salad and some sandwich. Schoolteacher went with the Eggplant Parmesan for the same reason.       Eventually, order guy came back with our drinks, and breads. He then took our orders, and left. Presumably the bread was there to keep us busy while he went off for another break or something.  It was quite some time before somebody completely different delivered our food.  Schoolteacher and I chatted about our future plans while we waited for our food.      When the food arrived nearly an hour after ordering, I was quite surprised by the soup. Mainly because order person had neglected to inform what kind of soup came with the special. Turns out it was a baked potato kinda soup. It was quite good though. The salad was also crisp and fresh. The turkey sandwich used a baguette fragment for the bread. With it's rough and super hard exterior crust, it's not a bread I'd have personally made a sandwich from. I was reminded of this several times during the meal when a jagged ridge of crust painfully dug into the roof of my mouth. I'll agree with the other reviewers, the serving sizes are indeed quite large.  I was full before too long. Schoolteacher was also slowing down on her Eggplant Parm. We decided to get everything wrapped up, and order some cheesecake for later.      I asked a random employee passing by for a to-go box, and one was quickly handed too me. We packed up the remainder of bread, and the eggplant and then waited for order guy to arrive. Who showed up eventually. At that point, I asked him for boxes, some to-go cheesecake, as well as the bill. I had hoped to mitigate the excessive time between visits by getting everything all at once.     Packed up foods and bill arrived after another excessive wait. Thankfully, my total was just ninety cents over the gift certificate. I held onto the bill until the cheesecake arrived. I then packed up my to-go items, and left him a nominal tip. Probably more than I should have, but sometimes I'm far too nice for my own good.      We got our parking stub validated, and returned to the structure to leave.  Later on that evening, after our bellies had cleared room, the cheesecake was in fact, quite delicious.    So overall, the food was simply ok. The cheesecake (and I from what I've heard the drinks) is quite wonderful. The service however was as slow as molasses in January.  I didn't know who to complain about because I had fifty different people during the course of the nearly two hour meal. The place is crazy crowded, and as a result, it is super noisy. While here, I somewhat understand why couples don't talk to each other over the table, over the noise and simply stare transfixed by their phones. I did my best to converse with Schoolteacher, and it was quite the challenge. I honestly don't think I'll be back. Unless it's to order cheesecake to go from the cheesecake to go counter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=220

Over the years I have had great experiences at the Multiple locations of Cheesecake Factory: (Beverly Hills, Irvine, Marina Del Rey, Pasadena, Sherman Oaks, Cerritos, Santa Monica, Canoga Park) .... and I've always noticed the same thing... THE SERVICE CAN REALLY BRING DOWN YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE to the point you don't want to go back for several months, which can be great by going out to more non-chain restaurants to explore what ELSE is really out there :)  The food here will always be consistent, so if you find that one dish you love, that is what you will continue to get :) The cheesecakes are great and each with its own intense flavor. This place has to-go service, but if you get cheesecakes to go you may not get all the extra toppings or extra decorative chocolate slashes that goes with it when you dine in.  If you have a complaint, the managers are usually accommodating unless you get that one manager who's going to be RUDE and try to make it like you're the problem. This place is good for huge parties, if it's your birthday the staff will come out and Sing Happy Birthday!....and this is usually the place I get invited to when family or friends are having a Birthday Party Dinner.

I was there with a party of 5, and it w a going to be a 45 min wait. It made sense because it was father's day. My parents decided they wanted to pass the time by eating appetizers at the bat area. I got a long island ice tea, which was pretty good. That was my favorite 3rd choice as they didn't have the ingredients for the first 2 drinks I had originally chosen : passion fruit Margarita and Ruby red sunrise. It was fine though as the drinks were good and popular. As a table, we decided to order the calamari and the Thai lettuce wraps as appetizers. Both were made really quickly and prepared nicely. I decided to order the skinnylicious salmon, which comes wait it vegetables instead of the the mashed potatoes that the original version comes with.  My sister ordered the lunch portion chicken marshala, which is a pretty good size for a lunch portion. It was also cooked really well.

Ariella F.,"Van Nuys, CA",0,13,1,2.0,8/24/2016,"This review is purely for the take out section. I arrived at this location before the doors opened at 11:30 to place my take-out order. One person ordered before me. I ordered my salad and they told me it would take 12 to 15 minutes. I paid and sat down. 30 minutes later, the person who ordered his salad right before me had already been given his food and left, the 10 or so people who came in with phone orders were given their food and sent away, even though their orders were clearly large and complicated.  I stood up to see if maybe I missed something when the girl behind the counter said to me ""yours isn't ready yet"". I sat back down and watched as more people came in and got bags and bags of food. Finally, a full 40 minutes after I had ordered, I stood up again and the girl at the counter asked a different girl if there was a Chinese chicken salad ready. She looked out a bag on the counter and said yes, and they gave me my food. I asked what time Phone order start getting taken, because I thought next time I should just call it in since clearly they prioritize phone orders. She was clearly aggravated when she told me ""no food orders go in before 1130"". If that's the case, I do not understand why my order took so long, I do not understand why the attitude towards me was hostile rather than apologetic when I waited almost three times as long as the estimate was on how long my food would take.  I get that it's a very busy time of day, but I didn't order anything complicated, and I wasn't rude at any point, despite having to wait for so long. The least they could have done was apologize for the long wait. My advice is never place a to go order inside the restaurant. Even if you have to stand outside and call it in, you'll be better off than doing it at the counter. And don't bother to tip them. Edit: Took the salad to my (not picky) 97 year old grandma for our weekly lunch and without me even saying anything about how disappointed I was in the service she started complaining about her salad. It looked like something from Applebees.  No color, bland, barely any chicken, all iceberg lettuce, few mandarins, few ""crunchies"". It was the dinner portion but it looked like nothing.

They have a terrible seating system. You check in and they give you a pager. Then you wait forever. Then it goes off and you turn it in. They don't take you right to your table, you then have to wait longer while other people are taken to their tables. Then someone finally calls your name and you go to a table. Tonight we waited 10 minutes between the time we turned in our pager to the time we went to our table. For people who have never been here, it's very confusing. You think when your pager goes off, you're going to be taken to your table, not wait in another line! The foyer area is very poorly designed and you have waiters rudely plowing their way through because there's nowhere for the double lines of people waiting to really stand.  Our waiter tonight, while very nice was S - L - O - W. Took our drink order and said he'd bring us bread right away. Took about 5 minutes to get our drinks even though we were right next to the drink station. It took 10 minutes to get bread. Other waiters were bringing bread within minutes of people sitting down. Took a good long while to get our food, but it was very crowded. Then we ordered dessert and it took another 19 minutes for that to come. We were actually in the restaurant for over 2 hours. Then to top it off, we had to pay for parking because we were there so long.

Ronna B.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,70,69,2.0,1/23/2016,"Most of us know what Cheesecake Factory has to offer so this is a review for the service at this particular Cheesecake Factory.  I've been to this location plenty of times and their service seems on and off, really depending more on whether you get a good server/zone or not. The last time I went with my husband and daughter, it was for an early dinner/very late lunch, aound 4-ish in a Friday. As you might imagine, it wasn't exactly busy at this time.  They sat us in a weird corner booth by the corner end of the bar where the servers were having their breaks! The first thing we over hear from some servers are, ""OMG you're such a slut."" ""So? I flirt with everyone. Men, women, that's just me. I even kissed that one dude."" And it went on. My daughter's 3. Call me crazy but we typically don't like to be surrounded by conversations about ""sluts"" when we're out having a family meal with her.  Then the servers got back on the floor and we thought, trying to avoid the inconvenienc of having to move, we'd stay because maybe it'll be OK now. Well, another server came to the designated break table and promptly started complaining about how she did not want to be at work anymore. She's tired, bullshit at work, she wants to go home, etc. Don't know about you but I LOVE Debbie Downers! I don't get enough free complaints and tired, annoyed sighs at work so, of course, soon as I get home I want to go to a restaurant with my family and pay to hear people complain some more! We finally asked to be moved. A very pleasant server took our order. Never saw her again. Another came by our new table and asked if we had been moved and who was our original server. This person was also never seen again. A third person brought out our food, after a much longer wait than we anticipated for such a slow time, and this person really couldn't be bothered. Did not smile, was not pleasant, was very abrupt during all points of interaction with us. Our meal was +$60. I could have gotten this treatment at a $10 per plate restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=240

This location is exactly what you would expect from any of the other CF chains, but it's especially good because the food (especially the bread) seems superior here compared to all other locations and especially bad because the traffic/parking can get pretty horrendous.

Donatella P.,"Burbank, CA",0,32,,2.0,9/25/2016,"Horrible experience.   We were a party of eight on a Saturday at 4 pm.  Since we were out celebrating a birthday and playing mini golf nearby, we thought we'd give this branch a try.  We phoned to get an idea of the wait time was.  The rep had no clue when I called.  The first call got ""disconnected"" apparently.  The second time I called, she placed me on hold to find out.  Three minutes went by without a response,  so I hung up.   We drove there within 10 minutes and there wasn't even one person waiting in the lobby nor outside.  We were told it was going to be a 45-minute wait.  When we asked why since they were empty, the rude front desk girl said, ""Well, yes, people are waiting.""  Really?  No one around and with many empty tables in the restaurant ???  We then asked to speak to a manager and with a rolling of the eyes, the front desk girl paged her.   Stephanie the manager came out.  I explained the situation and asked why there would be a 45 min. wait when the restaurant was practically empty.  I even showed her my phone with the calls I had placed, and she saw that I was not lying.  She told me that she was going to accommodate us right away, that there were two empty tables and were going to wait for a third table to pay and leave so they could seat us.  To make a long story short, 25 minutes went by before I saw the manager again walking around.  I approached Stephanie again asking if she had forgotten about us.  She was shocked to see that we had not been seated.  At that point, we were seated right away.   I ask myself, why are they so rude?  Who do they think they are?  People with higher class and education don't do that.  If the front desk people are not happy or hate their jobs, then they should leave!  But while they're there working and getting paid a salary that comes directly from customers' money, then the least they should do is do their job in a decent manner.    There was no reason to make us wait at all!!  We love Cheesecake Factory and love to take our kids' friends there to eat as part of their birthday celebrations.  We now know never to step in the Sherman Oaks Cheesecake Factory ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=300
Arlen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,12,,1.0,3/24/2017,"My wife and I just left the Cheesecake Factory in Sherman Oaks for the last time. What happened to this once very good restaurant? It wasn't very busy but service was miserable. They never came back to check on us, see how the meal was. My wife wanted a cup of coffee ... no one came to the table. My wife got up and asked for the coffee ... still didn't come. Then I got up and asked for the coffee ... which finally came. In the meantime ... servers standing around chatting. And the food: not what it used to be. Skimpy Cobb salad. Food cold. Not very tasty. Smaller portions. Another thing: my wife went to the restroom ... and was back quickly. It was filthy. Managemnt didn;t seem to care. Odd attitude. One final thing: prices have gone up. So if you want to overpay for mediocre food, barely served to you, have fun at the Cheesecake Factory. We choose to go elsewhere ... you should too! P.S. I was forced to rate the restaurant, which I would normally give ZERO stars. It gave the place one star. ZERO stars is my rating",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=300
Carlos J.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,10,,5.0,9/15/2015,"This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and let me tell you i don't know why it took me  so long to try their food! My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night so i was thinking the wait was going to be an hour when it was really thirty minutes.  We were seated on the patio and ordered the fried calamari. It was crispy,  mouth watering and scrumptious! not as good as the calamari I tried in San Fransisco but it was a close second.   I also ordered a  long Island Iced Tea. I don't know if It was me or I was feeling like a light weight that day, but It was much stronger than the other long island iced teas I had tried at other restaurants. My girlfriend ordered the Factory Peach Bellini. I was surprised she ordered a drink, because she doesn't drink often and she is an extreme light weight. I was thinking I might have to carry her back to my car, but luckily that didn't  happen.  On to the Entree's! I had the chicken piccata pasta. I was told this was the best pasta on the menu. I was not disappointed with it. The sauce was on point. Creamy, flavorful and a hint of lemon made the angel hair pasta taste like I was at some high up scale Italian restaurant. My girlfriend got the Alfredo Fettuccine Pasta. She enjoyed it. I'll be honest she is picky about her food too. ( I mean i consider myself a good cook, but sometimes she doesn't eat what I make her, like wtf) so she ended up finishing the whole plate. Yup we were that hungry.  Finally we ordered tiramisu. The presentation was remarkable. It looked like a $100 dessert . I was feeling a little fancy after the it arrived on the table. The taste didn't match the presentation, but overall it was still a good dessert. Frankly I am not a big fan of tiramisu anyways so I wasn't disappointed with the taste. Overall I would love to eat out here again. The environment was great, Service was fast and friendly. The bill was a little high but that was because of our drinks. Other than that I don't have any complaints about the Cheese Cake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=300
Alex S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,22,5,1.0,11/19/2016,"Had the most terrible experience today. After coming to the place and checked-in(there was a line of couple people waiting) was told that I will be seated in a few. I asked if there is a line and hosted replied that I'm 3rd in line and it would be just a couple of minutes. I didn't count people waiting though...but after ten minutes waiting I noticed something weird different people standing near and looks like some just came in and was already seated. I decided to wait 5 more minutes. After coming back to front desk and asking what is my place in line hostess replied ""They're cleaning the tables and you will be seated shortly"". She just told me this standard phrase and she didn't even bother to double check. I believed her and waited 15 more minutes. The situation was already ridiculous and I asked some other lady standing near the front desk. She checked my name in line and didn't find it. She asked the main hostess what's up, and she checked also and replied ""well it was there"". After than I was seated. Sound like no big deal...well for me wait 30 or 40 minutes not a big deal. But the way this lady treat me is unacceptable. Excuse me, am I in McDonalds? What's more frustrating - this lady lied to me! She just lied, didn't bother to do her job and finally didn't even asked apology this? No seriously simple ""I'm sorry I messed up with your place in line"" would do. But no...nothing. And you know why? Because she doesn't sorry. She doesn't care. She's there 10am to 6pm 5 days a week whatever. Paycheck is coming and that's it. No efforts to do her job properly.

The take-out department is the absolute worst. This location happens to be right across the street from us so we keep using it, but that's the only reason. Our order almost always comes out wrong or missing something (we don't customize our orders BTW so it's not like it is complicated). They are also the stingiest restaurant in the world with their sauces. And if you ask them for extra sauce you get maybe a teaspoon more. The cherry on top of the sundae is that we are always quoted about 25 mins wait time and are constantly sitting there waiting for 45 mins to an hour. It's so damn frustrating. Management is always quick to apologize and offer a piece of cheesecake rather than fix the problem. I don't want cheesecake!

If I wanted to be served cold chicken, cold eggs, cold omelette, I would have gone to Marie Calenders or some sht.  And the waitress.(it was 1:45 pm shift outside patio, front patio- think her name was Lauren, she had long brunette hair and she was short 5'6) comes over and is so disrespectful and condescending to my mother when she told her that she wasn't happy with the temperature of her food.

I asked for the manager. And the manager was pissed. Number one the waitress said ""we can just take it back and hear it right on up for you again"" that's against health code. You cannot/should not reheat eggs like that. Or raw chicken. I'm sure it was raw cause it was cold. Worst. Experience. Ever.  Not only did this waitress become super condescending at the end, she tells another (black) waiter to come and I guess """"deal"""" with us. What a way to ruin Mother's Day. The manager did the right thing and comped the meals that we didn't touch. They took them back after they touched it and it was ICE COLD. I wasn't paying for that crap.

This seems to be a thing in every cheesecake location. Most of the time when we ask the waitress or host for a booth or more private seating, they cater to our needs. Today though, the girl gave us no choice and told us to sit in those terrible (no personal space) seats that are in the middle. We asked for a booth and she said ""no that's for parties of 4"". The booths were clearly suitable for 2 people rather than 4. I didn't want to get into it with her so I told her to ""forget it"" & left.  Look Cheesecake Factory, no one likes those terrible middle tables. I went to the one in the grove few days before and they sat my cousin & I in those same horrible seats. However ! That one I understood because they were having a busy night. Today in Sherman oaks though, it wasn't overboard busy and that booth was a perfect fit for 2 PEOPLE !  Idk what you guys were thinking when you made those middle aisle tables but I think they work best for the parties of 4 or more rather than putting parties 2 there. I mean you awkwardly sit there & you can't have much of a conversation cos the people at the other table are at VERY close proximity to you are listening or they start judging what you ordered or THEY'RE JUST AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS YOU !  If you seat only big groups there & not small ones then we can all have a happy dining experience (: TL;DR ? : Middle/ Crowded/ Uncomfortable seats are not for parties of 2 !

This is not the impression that I had from the Cheesecake Factory I really saw this place as a restaurant that has great service and respected they're restaurant name but they do NOT I can honestly go on for ten more minutes about the bad service I received here and how disappointed I am of this place but I will leave it at the fact that I left hungry and upset and won't go back ever just because they unprofessionally did nothing to make it up to me or correct the mistake and again I left your place hungry and I paid.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=280

After being promised a piece of free cheesecake for the mishap, I asked for a piece of their popular wheat bread to get the taste of garlic out of my mouth. I asked my waiter, the manager, and a bus boy. The bus boy eventually brought  it.  3. Shortly after receiving my bread, the umbrella touching the heat lamp caught on fire. Another waiter promptly put it out. 4. About an hour after the cup mishap (hey, waiter, are you avoiding us?) we finally receive our food. Hey, how come the cheese in my Mac and Cheese balls isn't even melted? Oh, because it wasn't cooked.  5. The waiter finally comes back over to us and I get another cup of Coke.

As far as cheesecake factories go, this one is standard. They don't push you off your table. Two large patios with heaters. Sometimes service can be a little slow. I don't think that's any fault of the servers... More so that management understaffs the floor. Over the last few years Cheesecake Factory has really expanded their skinnylicious menu which is great. It is now really easy to get a pretty guilt free yet delicious meal. This is probably the ONLY chain big box restaurant that I eat consistently at. Parking validation for dinner which makes parking cheap, If not free. The lot here in Sherman oaks can be a bit annoying. You may have to park a bit far away and walk.

I know because I used to go to school at Paul Mitchell next door and I would frequent this location and never had a great experience. I came to this location twice in 3 weeks. Most recently I went for lunch yesterday with two friends of mine. The wait was only 10-15 minutes which isn't bad for Cheesecake. I always order the same item: Four Cheese Pasta with a substitution of Rigatoni. It's my favorite dish. Sometimes we order a few appetizers or small dishes. This location HAS THE WORST FOOD of any Cheesecake location I've been to. It's just never on point or tastes right. My poor friend ordered a cheese pizza and it tasted like dish soap and smelled absolutely disgusting. It's like they cooked her pizza on a half dirty and half soapy tray. The young male server with curly hair was polite, but he should re-think serving as a career choice. First he forgot my lemonade that I ordered until half way through the meal. Our waters were always low. He never remembered to bring us bread a second time. After I was finished eating, with no water and no lemonade, he finally asked if I wanted a refill. It was too late, I already was dying of thirst the whole meal! He was never within ear shot to call over to tell. My pasta was rubbery and the sauce was bland. My other friend had a salad and hers seemed good. Then, my friend (after only eating a bite of her pizza) told the waiter about the taste of her food and he just said sorry and didn't even offer her a menu or to substitute it for something else. It's never a memorable dining experience and the food is always below average here. I would re-think coming to this location if you are trying to find a nice place for lunch or dinner in this area.

Rosanne D.,"Camarillo, CA",0,10,,1.0,2/12/2017,"Awful experience.  Waited 45 minutes for a cheeseburger and bowl of chicken artichoke soup. The   food arrived and I began with soup. The chicken was chewy and the soup had a weird smell and luke warm.  I told the waiter  there were mushrooms and other things in my soup and asked if this was actually the soup I ordered. He asked another server and he said we have clam chowder tonight. Ok gross! My stomach is destroyed from the small amount of clam chowder I ate, thank God I was not allergic and went into anaphalacic shock. Just a horrible stomach ache now.  The burger was ok. The whole waste of time disgusting wrong meal should of been complimentary but that didn't happen. Totally disappointed will not return!!! The waiter didn't deserve a tip but I gave him one anyway.

The service was great and the waiter checked in several times making sure we had enough water. The food was tasty and the service was great, I definitely felt I got my moneys worth.  The only thing I did not like was the parking set up. Since they share a parking garage  with several other business's it is kind of a hassle to find a good parking spot.

When we came in to get seated, there were 2 girls at the receiving area, 1 of them was nice she had a smile on her face when she greeted us. 1 of them had no smile and was a little bitchy, she asked me what my name was and told me to wait to the side until my name gets called so i can be seated with her little smirk and attitude. Then another girl came and called my name and she looked like she was not happy to be working there either. My waiter was very pleasant, very nice.  He took care of us. Now, the food.

I have got to say the food was amazing we ordered the crab and artichoke dip and a Greek salad. We also ordered the fish and chips plate and the steak Diane plate. The steak plate was amazing had so much flavor and tender no need for a1 sauce. And the fish and chips plate the fish was battered so good and had a pleasant fried taste to it. The only bad part was the service our waitress did our order wrong and forgot some of our requests. We also waited awhile before even being asked for drinks and it took a long time to bring them out and we didn't get the water and tea requested until our food came out and had to request it again.

Jordan S.,"Valencia, CA",140,155,3,3.0,5/24/2015,"Okay. I have to say, that this place is probably one of the most over-hyped places in all of Southern California.  I have to start with the wait. Everyone waits over 20 minutes for a table whether you have a reservation not. I mean if you're someone who constantly eats out like me, you learn to just accept that some places will have waiting period no matter what.  The thing is, you wait on average 20+ minutes, and the food isn't that great. It's not bad, but it's definitely not something to die for either. Basically, the food doesn't justify the waiting period you have. You wait 20+ minutes for your buzzer to go off, and then you wait another 15 minutes inside for a table to clear. It's quite ridiculous at times. However, the service has always been incredible no matter how busy it is, and the decor is pretty.  The valet is nice, but I do trust my personal parking more than handing the keys to one of the random guys. I have seen some crazy shit over the past many years I have been returning to the Sherman Oaks Galleria. Plus, ou save almost $30 bucks on valet and the self-park is almost always empty from the 2nd floor up. A great parking spot is always certain to awaiting. It's a definite must-try, and I will be occasionally returning. P.S. I do suggest sitting outside. People watching is fantastic for those who do so, and the heaters make the atmosphere the warm-chilly weather that leaves the air nice and crisp. It's less noisy, and less 'traffic'. Plus, the waiting period is typically cut in half.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=340

(The rest of my party's food arrived seventeen minutes after mine). I completely understand that mistakes happen. However, this was the third time this has happened to us in this location. That's a training issue, not a mistake.  Having said that, the food is consistent, once it gets to you. It's not food I rave about, but it's solid, good food.

I was really happy about that considering it was packed. Why wouldn't this place be packed the food is delish! So I thought- Our waitress noticed the balloons that we had walked in with. Instead of saying happy birthday she asked if we could just move it out of the way. She seemed like she was annoyed or maybe having a bad day, who knows. I tried to not let her attitude bother me.  We ordered a chocolate milkshake for the birthday gal. Also who could go wrong with the southwestern eggrolls, chicken pasta and the buffalo blasts. We got out food all at  separate times. After having had worked ok the restaurant service, you learn to bring out everyone's food together unless otherwise specified. My chicken pasta was the last to be brought out. One night and it tasted extremely overcooked! I tried to eat it but I couldn't and I let the waitress know about the problem. She seemed extremely annoyed and just picked up the plate and walked off. I didn't know if she was going to replace it or what. I was angry at this point but I didn't want to make a scene. After some time had passed, another waiter brought my plate. Since they took so long and the birthday gal was done I decided to just ask for a box. I didn't pay $13.00 to take it home. Our waitress didn't come around to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We asked for the check and had dessert over at Crave.

Mia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,352,317,4.0,3/11/2014,"We came here because Sweet Butter was too crowded. I like that they have a light ""SkinnyLicious"" menu now with plenty of choices. Curiously the original menu doesn't list caloric content.  If it's your first time, be prepared to sift through all the menu chapters, as they serve American fare to Americanized versions of international cuisine. I'd say the best food are the appetizers. The Thai lettuce wraps are really good (3 delicious sauces) and fill me up even though they're an appetizer. Tuna tartare - delicious. good size for 3 Sausage ricotta flat bread (off the light menu) with few kinds of cheeses. Good but a little salty.  My friend's veggie salad - big but forgettable. Too much vinegar in the dressing. The fish taco entree was a huge, delicious serving. 4 tacos, big pieces of salmon (I think she requested salmon). However the white cilantro-seasoned rice was oily.   Of course it's hard to pass up on cheesecake here. We devoured my personal favorite, white chocolate raspberry. Others sound tempting. I want to try the pumpkin pecan next fall (Must pumpkin be seasonal everywhere? :/ )  The banana slice is light, almost mousse-like. For me the blueberry white chocolate is disappointing. Service usually is good but today was terrible. Among other things, we had to ask for bread.  At least they compensated with 3 loaves. Isn't the warm brown bread the best?  Parking is free for the first 2 hours free and this location is convenient, right where the 405 and 101 intersect.  It's mainly restaurants here and feels like a ghost town before noon on weekends.

The food at Cheesecake factory is always great, however today I was extremely disappointed by the service. I couldn't believe how unwelcoming and rude they were not only to us, but also to the other customers sitting at the table next to us. It was funny and disgusting at the same time to observe one of the waitress's expression of the face when the customer complained that they brought the wrong food for him. They kept us waiting for probably an hour and no one even came to apologize for the long wait even though it wasn't that busy there. I have been to Cheesecake factory in Glendale and have always left that place with a great feeling of satisfaction not only with the food but the welcoming nice atmosphere you feel there thanks to the staff that create that vibe by their genuine desire to provide great service and create a nice long lasting experience. It wasn't the case with the Cheesecake factory at Sherman Oaks location. Very unprofessional, ridiculously rude and unpleasant in their manners and attitude to the customers, as though the customers owe them something.

After eating we decided to order some cake. We went to the bakery section and asked for a slice of cheese cake. We waited 26 minutes to get ONE slice of cake. We payed for it and waited so long for one slice of cake. I came back today to purchase a whole cake. A tiramisu Cheesecake for my brothers birthday. I ordered over the phone an hour in advanced to make sure I would just have to pay and pick up the cake. I was wrong. I payed and waited about half an hour just so they could give me the cake. They take so long to get your orders out. I would not recommend at all ever to order from here. They take so long to give you something you ordered for that is so simple. While I was waiting I saw that they prioritized their waiters and waitresses to give them their orders to give to dine in customers way faster, while they have a huge line of customers waiting for their food or cakes that they have already Paid for. So unorganized and the managers just stand there seeing the problem and just say five more minutes. No you end up waiting way longer then that.

Decided to use the restroom before I left, and let me tell you, do not, and I repeat DO NOT use the women's restroom at this Cheesecake Factory. It is DISGUSTING! There were random stains on the toilet seats, tampon wrappers everywhere, toilet paper everywhere, some of it was wet too, paper towels were overflowing from the trash can. And the handicap bathroom was horrific. I didn't even use the restroom there anymore, that's how disgusting it was.  I let the manager at the host stand know about her little problem, she was a blond lady, really rude as well. All she said was ""thanks for letting me know"" and didn't even said anyone to clean it!  DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I probably won't return here, just because of that. I'm a clean freak. I can't handle how nasty that was.

Josh S.,"Los Angeles, CA",295,210,187,2.0,1/31/2015,"Certain people truly love The Cheesecake Factory, and I really just don't get it. The decor is gaudy (though I guess it matches a large percentage of the clientele), the menu and servings are bloated, and the food is mediocre at best. Sure the cheesecakes are decent, but when you stuff 1,000+ calories into a single slice of anything, the odds are it will probably satisfy.  Living in Los Angeles - a major city with what is probably one of the most culturally and culinarily diverse, yet grossly underrated (internationally) food scenes - I can't fathom why one would decide to venture here. If you visit one in a smaller city with limited offerings, it makes sense, but not LA. Sure, I've never experienced any bad service, and I guess that bloated menu will cater to any unadventurous eaters looking for a decent meal, but I'd like to think with a simple Yelp search and some pre-planning you can find better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=380

Katelyn was our server, very friendly and attentive. The food was not so good. Nothing wow'd us and for the price, we all agreed that we won't be back. Let me get down to the nitty gritty of my review. The only good food item we ordered was the spinach & cheese dip appetizer, this was delish!. And thank God for THAT because it took our food over 30 minutes to come out. My Omelette and potatoes were very sub par, I picked out the veggies and cheese and left the rest. I could have got the same or better at Denny's. Matter of fact, IHOP is better and portions are the same size!. No seasoning whatsoever! I felt like I was at the Seniors Buffet. Potatoes, bland and over cooked. My niece ordered french toast. The server that brought it to her, just handed it to her and didn't warn her, it was scalding hot! It burned her hands! She had to hold onto her glass of cold of iced tea to get the burning to stop. They have a weird system here. Your waitress takes the orders and checks in on you and a whole team (like 4 to 5 others, come out and deliver food) I've never seen such a display....it was literally a piece of sourdough bread loaf, sliced off, fried up and served. She said it tasted just like it looked, like a hunk of bread. Who makes french toast out of sourdough??? So basically, very bland, sub par, EXPENSIVE food. I can safely say that none of us will be back anytime soon and I will not recommend.

Hmmmm maybe he's new? B. He set our waters down and every server knows...serve the furthest person first...what did this guy do? Serve the closest person so that when he reached over the table to put the rest of the waters down, HIS TIE WENT INTO MY CUP. Yes he knew, because he straightened his tie right after...and didn't offer to replace my water...oh and still didn't offer bread. But eh i ordered a sangria so I figured I could just drink that.... C. We place our orders. I asked for a strawberry shortcake ""for here"" and a few other cheesecakes to-go for after the meal. When dessert comes he brings me a strawberry cheesecake that I originally wanted to go, not the strawberry shortcake, so that gets sent back. THEN I was able to finally ask for some bread.  D. We pay for the meal. Get the cheesecakes to go. And he didn't offer validation...again we had to flag him down and ask for it.  E. The strawberry cheesecake we took home was MELTED. I paid $8 for a blob of crap!!! Totally unacceptable!! We had a few drinks and appetizers with the desserts so we were at the restaurant for at least an hour.

Unfortunately our kids were so hungry, that we had to leave .  P.S. The manager ignored us in purpose while we leaving the restaurant.

We order Chicken chipotle pasta and avocado toast, the waitress returned with AVOCADO ROLLS and the Chicken chipotle pasta that was not properly drained so the sauce was watery and bland. After she took back the orders including the avocado rolls that we did not order she came back with the avocado toast burned to a crisp i mean black and rock solid. I called her back and told her we cant eat this it is burned please bring us our check. At this point i 100% thought a manager would come to the table not to apologize or anything bc its not his/her fault but atleast to see whats happening why we are sending our food back but no the waitress just comes back with the receipt no apologies no manager. They did wave off the charges for the food but were still petty enough to charge us $7 for 2 cokes. Now that i think of it i would think the manager would have to approve any adjustments to the bill so they were aware of what was going on and did not bother.

Aram M.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,7,3,5.0,7/14/2013,"Came here the other night with a big party. With past experiences at other restaurants, when you go with a big party the waiter doesn't treat you as good, because typically the party is loud and annoying. This time my experience was different. The waiter we had really did her job. She took everyone's orders, gave everyone excellent tips on what to order, knew exactly who ordered what, and she even kept coming and asking if everything is okay and if we need anything else. She asked us if each of us want to get our own checks and we said yes. She went ahead and conveniently split each one of our orders onto our own individual checks, down to the tip and the tax. The food at The Cheesecake Factory has always been great for me. You can't go wrong with anything that your order. I usually try a different burger each time I go, as I love burgers. This time I got the mushroom burger cooked medium well and it was delicious. I had read a review on yelp while waiting for the food and I was told to ask for the ranch, the review had said that the ranch was amazing and to die for. Well, long story short I found the ranch to be really really good.  I personally would recommend The Cheesecake Factory to anyone.

When our beeper ranged we went to the front and they asked us to wait for a minute and someone would sit us. As we waited we noticed other parties of two that came after us were being seated in front of us. After the third party was seated I approached one of the girls and asks why they were seating people ahead of us. We were told that those people had asked for indoor dinning. I explained to her that we specifically asked for the first available. I noticed they were giving people who chose indoor priority.

Lloyd B.,"Los Angeles, CA",455,420,1588,4.0,1/10/2011,"My favorite Cheesecake Factory.  Service is fast and friendly.  The menu is constantly changing but the favorites are always there. I usually order the fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes but I thought I'd try something new instead.  I ordered the New Orleans shrimp from their special lunch menu and it was good. Served over a bed of rice it had lots of flavor without being too spicy or salty. I liked the tiny pieces of sausage and bell peppers that were mixed in the shrimp. The Arnold Palmer was perfect with my meal.  Parking was easy and free with validation.

Not once did our server check on us or refill our drinks. I'm not coming back again.  I watched him serve three tables beside us, check up on them and completely ignored us.  Discrimination maybe?  Our server tonight, Dylan, probably thinks that Asians are bad tippers because he obviously didn't to refill our drinks. I watched him go to the tables near ours several times to check on them.

Jess D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1080,56,16,1.0,5/21/2015,"I took my two children here for an early dinner last night after they convinced me to sell one of my kidneys to be able to afford what the bill usually is, but kindly.. I obliged. As usual our bill was basically the cost of a Disneyland admission and just about as disappointing as the overpriced food at a theme park too. I ordered an appetizer and iced tea which was only refilled twice (apparently four tables was too much for our waitress to handle at 4pm) and my children had bow tie pasta off of the kids menu (which is the price of a Coach coin purse for the portion).  Now you would think, how does one screw up bow-tie pasta and butter, right? Well... apparently, Cheesecake Factory can and it's not a problem for their guy in the back at ""the pasta station"".  My younger sons arrived and it looked like something Gizmo from the Gremlin's threw up. The noodles which should only consist of butter and Parmesan cheese arrived looking burnt and covered in brown snot.  My other son ordered the same thing, but asked for no cheese and when it arrived it was dry (no butter, nothing). My older son was so grossed out that he didn't even want to eat anything else once the waitress came back over (after looking for her for about ten minutes). My younger son added his own cold slice of butter (that originally came with the bread) and it just wasn't the same for him, so he didn't really eat it.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake to split and it arrived and wasn't the size of the millennium falcon as I remembered it to be and was $8 (which instead of the Cheesecake Factory staff throwing in for free due to our gremlin vomit that was served to us), they charged us for it and only removed the two child's entrees from our bill, but charged me for the ""free soda"" that came with my sons entree and charged my other son an adult price for his soda.  Our bill was about $29.00 for basically two kids drinks, 1 adult drink, cheesecake and an appetizer.  So if you're into paying for crappy service, getting whiplash from searching for a waiter, and playing a game of ""what the hell is that on my child's plate?"" then by all means, eat here. But be prepared for NO manager to come over an apologize for the mix up and also be prepared for the staff to penny pinch your tab instead of doing what's right and comping your meal.  I still can't get over that they charged me for the free drinks on the kids meals! Really!?  I didn't even fight the price of our final tab, because we had a movie to go to and our waitress was perhaps doing her make-up or taking a hot yoga class, but survey says we will not be returning to this Cheesecake Factory anytime soon.

I like that I can easily park in valet, take the escalator up and there's the factory. We came on a crowded Saturday afternoon, but our wait wasn't as nearly long as I thought, the max was about 25 minutes. We where seated and quickly greeted by our server who was very attentive. As I looked over the menu everything sounded delicious and I finally decided on the angle hair pasta with shrimp sans garlic. It was a very nice portion that I couldn't even finish it but when our server asked to take my plate there was some miscommunication that I wanted to take it home and instead it was tossed... We looked over the dessert menu of course and we opted to take home two slices, one classic and one Reese's peanut butter cup ( both sooo good) for our dessert there, I had a cafe mocha which was served in a glass cup which I wasn't use too and I had a few sips of a banana peach smoothie like drink.... Okay when the bill came I was whoa.. close to $80.00 but I had a $45.00 gift card so that helped the wallet alittle.. the food is good and it was a very enjoyable evening but $80.00 not including tip and no alcoholic beverages consumed is not worth it to me.

Kristin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,38,6,5.0,11/2/2015,"I don't know why this Cheesecake Factory has 3.5 stars, because out of the all the ones I have been to in Los Angeles, which include Pasadena, Woodland Hills, Marina del Rey, and Beverly Hills this location is the best.  The food is always amazing, and they give you huge portions for what you pay for. My favorites here are: Crab Wontons, Macaroni and Cheese Balls, Chinese Chicken Salad, Chicken Madeira, and my all time favorite is the Chicken Costoletta. I've also had the breakfast dishes as well and they were really good.  Favorite Cheesecakes: Strawberry, Dulce de Leche, Pineapple Upside Down, and I just tried the Salted Caramel cheesecake and it was delicious! If you don't like it too rich I wouldn't recommend it. The service here majority of the time is amazing. Last night my family went out for my parent's anniversary dinner and the waiter we got was amazing, his name was Joseph G., so if you happen to get him you're in good hands. If you come during a busy time or on weeknight or on the weekend, there might be a possibility of getting bad service because of how crazy it is, but I think 99% of the time I come here I always get amazing, if not exceptional service. If you're in a small party of 2-4 people and don't want to wait, I'd recommend looking for a seat in the bar area, you might be able to snag something if it's not too busy and they serve everything the restaurant serves.  My recommendations for people who come here is to get here at least by 5pm, or before especially on a Friday, or a weekend. This location does get busy and you could be waiting 45+ minutes or more. They do not take reservations. The walk from the parking lot is about 5 minutes, or so. Also, Cheesecake factory validates parking for 2 hours, if you're planning to go to see a movie at the Arclight later, I would validate there since the theater validates for 4 hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=460

I have to say my most favorite thing is the fire grilled artichoke.. It's FABULOUS!!  I have to compliment them on their ability to handle such a huge menu.. and the consistency it remarkable because of that.. The only reason I'm not giving a full 5 stars is more so because of the lack of management to take care of their bar employees As we were sitting at the bar I see the gal behind (our bartender that night) with a big clear hose that she needed to use to clean the ice bins behind the bar. 1st it was about 2"" in diameter and a little distracting to see as you are eating.. but worse it was held together with tape..  We joked to her about it but she informed us that was the only way to do what they needed to clean the ice bins.. I then commented that at least they (meaning the company) could get her a ""hose"" that wasn't held together with cheap tape.. she chuckled that they had told management that they needed a new one and this was what they returned...

I would never recommend to come here starving, you almost at all hours of the day have to wait anywhere from 10-45 minutes easy. Then you are seated and there goes another 10-25 minutes for waiting for food. Breakfasts: Breakfasts are usually better then the dinner courses because they have to cook everything and most  breakfasts require eggs, fruit, and bread you can't go wrong with that.   Lunch's: If you get a salad you usually can't go wrong, their salads are huge and taste fresh enough. Dinner: Now dinner's I have had more bad dinners because of waiting time to eating food you can tell that it had been previously frozen then deep fried (more appetizer I've experienced). I feel I'm always hesitant to order pasta dishes or appetizers. I will say however their burger are very good.   Bar: Drinking at the bar is fine, it's your typical bar but you can order food.

I don't like to be judgemental and think that the host made our party and the other  Hispanic party wait a long time simply because didn't  look wealthy or like we would spend a lot. But that what it seemed like. Its also funny that they sent us a Hispanic waiter to serve us once we got seated like maybe we didn't understand English.

Everything is always cooked to order and packed with flavor.  Normally when I come here, I always order the Miso Salmon. I have tried other entrees but this is my absolute favorite.

Heather W.,"San Diego, CA",1673,907,2600,2.0,2/8/2012,"there is a running joke in my family that every time we get together for a celebration meal...i come back here and talk crap about the place. well family - im sorry! i wish it would stop happening. i dont go out of my way to write less-than-stellar reviews. its been a disappointing coincidence :/ mediocre with a splash of insult pretty much sums it up. and maybe that should be the descriptor for most chain restaurants, to be honest, and expected. but with the cheesecake factory especially, ive continued to regret eating their non-dessert concoctions. part of me realizes it was a bit silly to go and order a salad. but hey, specialty salads can be good! they have this delightful ""skinnylicious"" menu boasting low calories and a light meal was all i wanted. the tortilla chicken salad sounded perfect (especially since i--a simpliton---made a pretty bangin' version). hello giant pile of lettuce! hello sad 3 pieces of chicken hidden way below pile of lettuce (im not even lying...look at the pic of how ginormous it is with absolutely no substance). sad, flavorless, unappealing. and charged something like $12. quite possibly the worst and most insulting salad ive ever consumed. had potential if they hadnt cheaped out on the main ingredients. HEY HEARS A THOUGHT: instead of making the size absolutely ridiculously big with filler lettuce - make it NORMAL with a few more pieces of chicken. and while we are at it - take 2 bucks of the price to make it actually appropriate. because the price tag is inflated right along with the cheap iceburg lettuce.  oh but great play indeed finding the most effective way to profit off your menu items - in true chain restaurant form. im guessing this cost *maybe* $2 in ingredients since its made up of iceburg (the cheapest lettuce with zero nutrients) and tortilla strips. come for the cheesecake, stay for the cheesecake. nothing else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=480

Ciara G.,"Frenchtown, NJ",187,1212,7583,4.0,2/8/2010,"I think i have said it before but I'll say it again anyway, Cheesecake Factory is probably the only major chain restaurant out there where you know what to expect and what you will get no matter what location you dine at. Consistency is key and that is the only way they are able to pull off their huge menu so well.  Tonight I had something old and something new.  Something old: Crispy Orange Chicken. The presentation was different from what I remembered but it tasted the same as it did when I had it probably over 5 years ago. Chicken was crispy and juicy. Rice was steamed perfectly. Veggies were fresh and crispy and cooked just as perfect as the rice. Orange sauce was zesty and sweet and there was just the right amount of it.  Something new was the Mini Corn Dogs for $4.95 off their new Small Plates menu. Being Cheesecake Factory, the only thing small or mini about this Corn Dog dish was the price. Sweeetttt! Jes ordered the Four Cheese Pasta and I stole a few bites and it was quite yummy. I like how the use the tiny small penne noodles instead of the standard size ones.  Jeremy was our server and he was great. Water glasses were kept filled through our whole meal and we didn't even have to ask or look around for him to do so once. Did a great job at trying to sell us his personal fav Dutch Apple Cheesecake but we had to pass since we already had milk on the mind.

Timmy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,2.0,9/25/2015,"As a former server, bartender, and manager of a restaurant no one can be more understanding than I am when it comes to restaurants and the issues that come with them.  Wednesday 9/23 on the patio around 8pm I must say Cheesecake Factory you fell so very short of what I would call acceptable especially from such a large chain.  Greet time-Eh, wait time for drinks-eh, nothing really to complain or write home about. Crab cakes came out COLD... not lukewarm... not marginally cold... COLD. They had been sitting for quite some time the patio is not on the other side of the city. To the servers credit he did get us new ones.  Food- how 5 people can not get their order to all come out at the same time is pretty insane to me. A party of 10, 20, 30? Ok I get it. But how do 2 people get their meal, then 2 to 3 minutes later the other 2... and of course my meal is no where to be found. About 3 minutes before the food started to arrive we ordered 2 more drinks, now there are 4 plates, no drinks, and no server to be found anywhere on the patio. This goes on for an addition 5 minutes or so until a manager comes over apologizes and lets me know my meal will be right out.  The server still is no where to be seen until he comes with my drink... note to server if your kitchen fails you (allegedly) I would be pretty damn sure that the customer had ANYTHING else I could possible get him until his food arrives.  Even after all that sure I was not a happy camper but I didn't drive home thinking to myself (man I can't wait to fill out a Yelp tomorrow) It wasn't until the next day when I go to eat my leftovers (boxed by the server, bags handed to each individual person) that I realize captain genius handed me my girlfriends bag and obviously mine to someone else.

Since this place is busy most of the time (and can be LOUD) I find take out works much better. I strongly suggest calling in your order (most orders are ready within 20 minutes) and then use the temporary (white zone) parking spots on Ventura Blvd which is right next to the side entrance of the restaurant. The take out counter is right there when you enter this way so getting in and out is a breeze. The food is consistently excellent, though I suggest you check your order before you leave as occasionally they will make a mistake. Customer service is always pleasant and while the food is a little pricey, it's not unreasonable for the quality of the product. I recommend the four cheese pasta and the cobb salad (minus the egg) with balsamic dressing. These two items can also be had on the lunch menu before 5pm. The chicken marsala and chicken madera are both excellent dishes but not sure if they are worth nearly $20.

To make it worst, we came here to celebrate my sons 10th Birthday and it left the worst taste in our mouths, literally too. We waited 2 hours to sit down. After 1 1/2 hour wait, we checked on the status of our table. We were told our 2 tables were being put together. 40 mins later we get seated at a booth. What happened to the tables that were being put together???? We didn't know and apparently they didn't either since they had no real explanation. By this point, 2 hours went by so we're now forced to rush our orders as we had somewhere else to be. Then the bread comes out, but guess what? No white bread. There was no white bread available. We had to wait 10 mins for some white bread. When the food comes out, it was not what most of us expected. 1) Kids spaghetti & meatballs = 1 meatball. Really? 1 freaking meatball? 2) my rice was so undercooked & dried. 3) my brother in laws pasta was rock hard!!!! To try to make all this up, they offer us a Cheesecake. But get this, they only offered 3 slices for a group of 9!!!!!!!! We requested they accommodate the kids and not offer the adults anything. They're response was ""we can cut the slices in half, but each kid cannot get their own slice""??? Really!!!!!! End result, we got the check and got the F out of there. They gave us a small Cheesecake, but we didn't even bother signing to my son or allowing him to open his presents since being there 1 more minute was just unbearable. I'll never return to this establishment as I was never even a fan of this place to begin with. We only came here cause my son wanted Cheesecake, but we took their cake and tossed it in the garbage.

A manager came over and wanted to ""educate us in how ground beef is prepared"" and ""for next time if we wanted it well done we need to request it that way"" from my culinary understanding there isn't a measure of done vs well done when it comes to ground meats. When you grind a meat you are dispersing the bacteria living on the outside of the meat throughout it, thereby nullifying cook times cause the bacteria is all over it.

I hope you come in every time I work just to keep me in line!"" And stormed off. My mother and I are both chefs and currently work in health and sanitation departments. What this employee was doing was disgusting and against the health code. All I tried doing was help him save his job and the restaurants grade.  We ordered the Cuban rolls.... They were Awful. However, the potato tots and the French country salad were nice.

Alyssa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",142,32,2,4.0,12/4/2013,"So after my horrendous, horrible, awful, mind blowing experience I wrote to corporate.  About two weeks later I received a phone call and it was corporate. I cannot remember his name it believe it started with a J.... Anyways he was very nice and asked me to explain what had happened. Once again I relived THAT experience. (We will refer to him as J for future reference) ""J"" followed with many apologies and explained The Cheesecake Factories goal and customer outlook blah blah.  I appreciated the personal call because after two weeks I had assumed I wouldn't ever hear from them. ""J"" asked if it was okay to share what I had told him with the store in Sherman Oaks and I said that was fine. Then ""J"" offered to pay for my dry cleaning of the pants that were ruined and said he was going to be sending me a ""very generous"" gift card ($50 is what I received.)  The disappointment there is that $50 doesn't even pay for the two meals and drinks we had paid for the first time around. Oh well. Can't be to greedy. He told me to go back to the Sherman Oaks one and ask for the manager but to be honest I don't know if I will ever go to that place again without having my sense memory kick in with that horrible vomit smell. So I went to the one in the Marina and it was great. Thank god. Our server was attentive, had personality and boxed my food up for me to go. (The first place just put boxes in front of me) The view was fantastic we sat right on the edge of the patio overlooking the water.

Located in the Sherman Oaks Galleria, so be prepared to wait. We had reservations and we still ended up waiting close to a half an hour. Keep in mind, they won't seat you until at least half of your party is there. They validate for parking. Food The food is ok here, nothing amazing in my opinion. I usually get the fried macaroni and cheese balls. They're the best thing I've had on the menu. My boyfriend got the tuna tartare appetizer, which was pretty yummy too.

We decided on Cheesecake Factory, even though my gut said not to. We got in quick, and the menu is giant! It's super crowded and you kinda feel like your a sardine in a very noisy can. Anyway our waiter comes gets us drinks says he'll be right back...20 mins later...entrees ordered, 30 mins later, no entree and empty drinks, have not seen our waiter to ask for refills. All the other waiters fly by as I try to flag one down. 10 more mins, ok food come, a different waiter spills hot grave on my husband, responds, ""oh I didn't know it was spilling."" Cleans it up and scurried away before we could ask for refills or anything else. We are shoveling our food in our faces so we can get to our movie. Our waiter finally comes...to give the bill to the table next to us, without even looking at us, he turns away. I had to Flagg him down to ask for a refill and tobacco. Refills come 5mins later, no tobacco. At this point I just hand him my credit card and ask for the bill. The bill came back immediately. I still have him 20% tip even thought it was a horrible experience and a horrible server. I am sure he was just super busy, but for the price, cheap quality of the food, and the service...never again cheese cake factory.  On a side note: I saw something kinda gross, my they were clearing the table next to us, busser pulls a dirty rag out of his apron and wipes down the table, then puts clean silverware right on the surface of the table. How is that keeping the utensils clean?

He came back with the same damn plate of ""steamed"" green beans... The chef took butter smothered green beans and dropped them in boiling water hoping the butter would rinse off. It didn't completely and the oily residue on my hands and on my plate wasn't enough for them to be honest, so whatever. I'm not coming back EVER. I plan to share this with my friends... This place uses about 20lbs of oil and butter on food anyway daily, so I expected them to be honest about their ""technique"" to make things healthier.

(and that's when it was PACKED). Service is always prompt and nice. Last time I went my mom and I were rushing before a movie... although I hate when customers rush me, our waiter was so nice and understood and accommodated everything for us.  As far as food choices the menu is like 20 pages long. The bread they bring you (esp. the brown one) is delicious. I always ask for balsamic vinegar or vinegrette on the side and it's enough to hold you over before the food arrives. There are appetizers and small bites for less than 10$ to get you started as well. Some plates I usually get that are always good are the blackened chicken sandwich and the jambalaya pasta. Warning: the desserts are MASSIVE but also delicious. Cheesecake of course, is also great. The decor is also unique and adds a lot of character.

After she finished speaking with them she then proceeded to join another female server at the station and proceed to have a lengthy conversation with her.  Meanwhile my companion and I were sitting, with menus closed clearly waiting to order, as we had more than enough time to make our selections. We waited and waited.  Finally I had to interrupt her personal conversation with her coworker and ask if one of the two was our server. She then replied that she was our server. I then had to request for her to take my drink and food order as I was thirsty and hungry equally.   She took our order brought us our drinks and went back to the booth behind us to continue talking with the group of men sitting there.  We could not tell if she knew them but either way was overly attentive to them.  Again while having another lengthy conversation with them one of her other tables got up and reminded her she was waiting on her refill. Instead of immediately going to get her drink she told her ""just a minute"". The lady walked back to her table. Server continued with her convo and then eventually went to get the ladies drink refill. She passed by our table several times but never offered to get us Iced Tea refills.  We, again had to bring to her attention that we needed refills.  I wish my party of two held the same attention for her as the booth of men behind us did for her.  I then believe we would have received the Quality of  service we should have received instead of what we got today.  I'm very disappointed with my visit today at your location as I frequent your location, the Pasadena location and Rancho Cucamonga location and have never had to bring up the subject of Poor Service before this instance.

There were noodles and veggies inside and it was also delicious. And ant Happy hour prices you can't beat it. My only complaint was when I first arrived there was a problem seating me. I wanted to sit in the bar area, but at a low table. I guess the waitress was trying to fill out the back section of the bar. And I bluntly said ""I am not sitting back here."" She started to say something, and I repeated ""I am not sitting in the back section."" And then I pointed to a table and said ""I want to sit there."", and she said there was no waiter for that area. So finally on my third try we found a table for me to sit.

Kira P.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,79,187,4.0,11/16/2011,"For my Birthday in October my mom gave me a $50 gift card to The Cheesecake Factory.  I saved it for a special occasion.--- Our 11 month anniversary on 11/11/11 :) We called the night before and requested a reservation.  We were told that that night (a Friday) would be walk in only, we also found out that they stop seating at 12:30 am, which we thought was really cool since we are night owls anyway. We arrived at 9:30pm and were seated less than a minute later.   Our booth was a 2 seater on a main isle but almost all seats in this venue somehow maintain an intimate feel no matter where they are. My boyfriend was a bit indecisive about what drink to order and even though the waitress(Adriene) did seem busy at the time she was patient with him and was willing to explain the drinks to him.   Drinks Bf- Long Island Ice Tea (which he sent back after he had a few sips to add more soda because it was strong, not necessarily a bad thing ;) Me- Bud Light w/lime. Entree Bf- The Old Fashioned Hamburger.  He substituted the fries for broccoli (no charge). The runner brought the burger and said he would be right back with the broccoli.  He never returned.  Later when our waitress checked back with us we told her that the runner never came back with the broccoli.  She brought it to us soon after. The burger was huge and the amount of broccoli that was on the side was a very big portion. Me- A Factory Combination: Steak Diane(minus the mushrooms) & Herb Crusted Salmon w/mashed potatoes which I substituted for asparagus ($1.00 charge) I'm used to huge portions at The Cheesecake Factory and that is what you always hear about the place but I do have to say the combination for $19.95 with 6 nuggets of Steak Diane was a bit lacking in the steak side than what I had expected, but I do have to say it was very flavorful and juicy with a few caramelized onions on top and sitting in tasty Au Jus.  The Salmon was an ok size considering it was part of a combination but would have definitely been too small if it was in a meal of its own. All in all our experience was a good one.  Our server was attentive and had personality and patience to deal with me and my boyfriends requests, the food was very flavorful and our drinks were delivered promptly and met our expectations.   Our bill came out to $49.43 so that was awesome aswell. We totaled out the card by leaving the left over cents on the tip line and left a $12 cash tip.   It was a great topper to an awesome anniversary and I would love to go back some time, especially if I had another Gift Card ;)  LOL!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=560

Simon M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,4,1,2.0,4/26/2015,"We were lovers of the cheesecake factory before, but we will never go back to this one. I understand that it was a busy Saturday night but to keep us waiting for 1 hour when they said 30 minutes is a bit ridiculous. When we were finally seated, we realized the silverware and plates were filthy and had it sent back for new ones. After the waiter took our order, we were never given bread! We had been waiting in the cold for 1 hour to be seated and not even some bread! He had offered it to other customers but not us....? After that, he just walked over and began to socialize with his co workers in a group of 3. Very unprofessional. When the food came(we ordered a pizza and pasta), the pasta was extremely undercooked. I understand that they leave it a bit undercooked but I couldn't even eat this pasta with my fork because it was so hard. Overall, not a good experience. It was my daughters birthday so I could not complain to the waiter as much as I wish I could have, but i still expected more from such a big name restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=560

The waiters/waitresses are always very friendly and knowledgable of the menu. The decor is nice. Looks upscale enough for a date night, but comfortable enough for a family dinner. And the location is great, right on Ventura Blvd, next to the 405, and in the same mall as the Arclight Theatre.  CONS: There is always a wait and never any places to sit while you wait for your table. The lobby is very small, making it difficult to push through the crowd of people once your table is finally called. The hosts are never particularly friendly. The entire restaurant has a dysfunctional floorplan, you constantly have to dodge people and waiters on your way to/from your table and the restroom, all while trying not to knock food/drinks off other guests tables.

I had the beet & goat cheese arugula salad and a tuna tartare--served with wonton chips and sesame vinaigrette. Both were tasty and reasonably priced.  For dessert, the five of us were going to share the key lime cheesecake until the waiter told us about an off-menu mango key lime that would soon be out of the restaurant.

I had a large group with me (7 people) and we were told there was a 20-30 minute wait. Fine. Our buzzer went off fairly quickly, but then after turning it in, we waited another 10-15 minutes before getting seated. Overall, our wait time was 20-30 as promised, but how strange to have our buzzer go off and then receive no acknowledgements for another 10 minutes!! The hosts all seemed annoyed, busy and overwhelmed too which is never a good sign.  Once at the table, we were greeted by our server in a very strange way. She quite literally said she was tired and in the weeds. It was weird. She took our orders and everything came out correctly and considering how busy they were, in a pretty timely fashion. But only half the table received their food. And it was a solid 5 minutes before the other half arrived.  Later on, someone at our table knocked their ketchup ramekin off and it splattered all over the floor. Four employees walked through the mess before it was noticed and cleaned up.

I got the four cheese pasta and my friend got the Orange chicken.  We were started with two kinds of bread with butter and some water. The food itself was ok nothing special in my opinion just big portions. The pasta was good not too cheesy and not too saucy. The orange chicken was ok, they were big and tender which was nice. We ordered the dulce de leche hot chocolate, and I have to say it was pretty good. Really sugary though. Our waiter was really sweet, kept making sure we were doing ok. For dessert we ordered the original cheesecake since we were already going into a sugar coma from our drinks. It was really good overall I just feel it's over priced.

Teren A.,"Burbank, CA",0,10,3,5.0,3/8/2015,"I have been to this location at least 100 times in my life. The food here has never disappointed me. There are so many options that you can have whatever you are in the mood for and know that it be at the least, good, at best - you will have cravings later. I also have to give a shout out to the happy hour menu. To me, this is the kind of place you can never go wrong with. My faves: miso salmon, chicken bellio, chicken potstickers, the amazing bread basket, all the desserts.  Having been here so many times, I never thought to write a review, until my server on Friday night, Allen S. changed that.  Allen was that good. I was a little nervous when he never bothered to write any of our orders down - we were a party of 5 with drinks, appetizers, and 5 separate entrees. And I was a little bummed when our bread was served cold. (No, no, no - the butter has to be able to melt and drip out of the bread sandwich while you devour it.) But that was remedied pretty quickly.  Our orders came out perfectly, drinks were refilled, we were checked on and just enough times to make sure we were happy, and we were. But what took the cake was that Allen noticed, while carding my son for his alcoholic drink, that it was my son's birthday. We had not mentioned anything at all because it had been a rather solemn day for my son. However, when our server, Allen, noticed the date of birth on my son's ID and took the initiative and time to bring out the celebratory lit candle and song, it lifted everyone's spirits.   On any given day, you never know what that stranger you just came across has been through. It is absolutely true that one act of kindness can help. Allen did that. That kind of initiative deserves praise and recognition. The food would have kept me coming back.

I seeked his advice on how to have my birthday dinner at the restaurant on March 9th at 7pm with about 30 people.  He advised me they do not take reservations, but to come in an hour earlier and put my name down, and since it was a Monday, it is there slowest day of the week so being seated with my group should not be a problem.  I arrived on March 9th at 6:15pm and the manager on duty, her name was Sara and she informed me she could seat my group immediately. I informed her I informed my group to arrive at 7pm but I am in early to put my name down as per the previous manager I spoke to.  The manager, Sara, was soo rude.  She informed me and my boyfriend that she has a server who will be holding the section off for 40 minutes so my party needed to arrive at 7p and at the latest 7:05p or else she will give up our table and the rest of my group will be seated elsewhere. The way she approached me and my boyfriend was very condescending, not accomodating in any way. She came back at 7:05p, huffing and puffing and said she has to give up our table or seat whoever is here.

My friends tried to speak to her and she did not care. When my friend informed her that we would carry the group elsewhere her response to us was ""have a good night"". We informed her that she lost a group of 30 people. She did not care. This place is rude, unprofessional, no sense of customer service whatsoever.

I've had the Club salad which was nice and it also wasn't drenched in dressing which is an added bonus. The club sandwich is good but it isn't anything special and is kind of generic.

The pizza was overcooked, like cardboard, and so thin I felt like I was eating a slab of salty greasy melted white velveeta cheese. The salad consisted of wilted lettuce and 4 raw tomato wedges. Waitress kept trying to take our plates away AS we were eating. Never bothered to ask if we wanted drink refills or dessert.  This place has definitely gone downhill.

I ordered the the herb grilled salmon, with mashed potatoes and broccoli. uh-may-zing. The pricing was great. I loved this place so much i wound up staying and hanging there for 5 hours with my friend talking with the bartender.  After tipping him i spent a cool $100 but i didnt care, I was happy to spend it. I dont mind spending money if my experience and food is amazing.

Frank M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,2.0,9/21/2015,"So here we go, order five waters and a bottle of wine. The water comes and one glass has filth inside and we had to ask the server take it back. Order appetizers and all comes as ordered. The entrees comes out and my meatloaf was a little black on the edges and the vegetables ice cold. My daughter's salad was supposed to be Falafel salad and turned out to be ice cold fried crab mixture balls so we sent that back to be remade. So we ask for the two salads we had ordered to be boxed and the server asked if we wanted the meatloaf boxed and we said no. Out comes two bags one with one salad and the other with the meatloaf. Okay, dessert should be a no brainier. Order three cheesecakes and out comes two of the three we ordered and third was wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=640
Ann C.,"San Jose, CA",2,8,,1.0,8/23/2015,"This place has gone to hell recently. I have been experiencing worse and worse service and worse and worse food everyday. Today must be my last time to come to this place. Today's story started with my waiter bringing regular mojito when I ordered for passion fruit mojito. When I said that I asked for passion fruit mojito, he said, ""This is passion fruit mojito"". Really??? The passion fruit mojito has a different color than regular mojito, for God's sake. Then, my appetizer came exactly at the same time as my entree and the pasta in my entree was half cooked. When I asked the waiter to get the manager, he didn't. I asked another waiter to get the manager. After around 20 minutes, the waiter came. When I told him the issue, he didn't even say sorry a single time and simply took my appetizer and mojito away. And the best of all...they charge for all of these. Well, this is the last time they got my momey... It used to be a nice place, Alas...I will miss it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=640
Andie M.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",1,49,4,2.0,7/25/2015,"i admit, I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time. I always really liked the food, and I knew there was usually a solid wait for a table, but when we finally went to this location last week (our first time at this location) it was to order carry out. So I didn't anticipate that from the time we pulled into the garage to the time we pulled back out with our order, a full hour might pass. Granted, the Galleria is so oddly laid out that it took several minutes to get from our parking space to the restaurant. But the wait inside was needlessly long, too. We finally got home with our food, most of which was good, but we ordered one of the beef dip sandwiches and requested the horseradish sauce on the side. we got that. and nothing else. they gave us a plain beef sandwich with no cheese, onions, OR DIP! It's a beef DIP sandwich. In what world does asking for one condiment on the side equal leave every single thing off? We're lucky we got beef and not just a plain roll, I guess. And the beef was so fatty and grisly I couldn't even chew half of it. What a disappointment. We'll stick to just getting cheesecake here and go elsewhere for meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=640
Samantha V.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,3,,1.0,12/16/2013,"My husband and I got food poisoning from the food here last Friday night. We each ate 1 crab cake with some of the sauce I had a bit more sauce than he did, a couple of buffalo strips - I ate 1 and 1/4, he had 3 and filet mignon. I got mine with the sauteed spinach and he got the fries. We shared the spinach and had a few fries. We also shared mushrooms to go on top of the steak. I lost 2 days of work and endured relentless, searing stomach pain for 3 days. I'm guessing it was either SALMONELLA or E.COLI.  A co-worker today informed me that she ate there once and got food poisoning and so did a few of her friends. That place was so crowded and every table was full. I wonder how many others got sick. Clearly they either have a problem with food safety or someone isn't washing their hands. I'm pissed!!!!

Jessica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",155,106,41,1.0,12/8/2013,"A few weeks ago, my friends and I decided to go out for dinner and we picked Cheesecake Factory because they have such a wide variety of foods. We knew that the wait was going to be a while, it was a Saturday night around 8:30. The hostess told us it would be about 55 minutes.  So 60 minutes later, when our buzzer hadn't gone off yet, we went to ask about how much longer.  Like I said, we anticipated a long wait time but were starving so we wanted to know when we would be called.  The hostess was so unbelievably rude to us- she told us how busy it is and that it hadn't been 55 minutes yet. And I showed her my watch and told her what time we got there and she proceeded to tell me that I was wrong.  THEN when our buzzer went off, we went to stand and wait for someone to take us to the table.  (This process they have is completely bull, they have your buzzer go off so you have to stand in a crowd of other people who's buzzers went off, for another 15 minutes until someone can take you to your table! I don't understand why they can't have the buzzers go off when there's actually someone ready for you.)  Anyway... As we're waiting, the rude hostess is standing there giving my friends and I one of the best evil eyes I've ever seen.  Okay I get it- your job sucks. But there's absolutely no reason for you to be so rude towards me. Especially at this point, where we were just waiting for our table. (That was about 25 minutes past the time they had originally told us)  So one of my friends asks to speak to her manager, after her asking if the hostess had a problem.  As the manager comes over, and she tells him what's happened, him and his lovely hostess are LAUGHING at our situation. He walks over to me, I'm not sure if he thought we didn't have eyes and couldn't see 10 feet away from us? But he puts on his serious face. Apologizes, not for his ridiculously ghetto, rude, uneducated hostess- but for how busy the restaurant is.  I know how busy the restaurant is!! I have eyes!  As he walks away, he again laughs and high fives his hostess.  Our food was delicious and our waiter was as sweet and wonderful as can be. But unfortunately our entire meal was ruined because of how worked up we got over how unprofessional the manager and the hostess were.  So.. Not sure what kind of business that manager thinks he's running, but he's ruined it for us and we won't be returning.  And I understand this is a huge business and one customer isn't going to effect their numbers, but it isn't acceptable to be acting the way they did. Especially in front of customers!  They'll get their karma in the end. The world doesn't like mean spirited people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=640

Morgan W.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",59,160,19,2.0,3/26/2012,"I was here yesterday and we had just finished our meals when the power went out. I understand this can raise some issues, so I am more then happy to allow for more time for things to happen, but this was a bit much. So the power goes out and 20 minutes later a runner comes to let us know our server will bring us our check shortly. At that time we asked him if we could please order cheesecake, he gave us a surprised expression and said he would be right back. Now isn't that the only reason that people overpay for mediocre entree's? So that they can have CHEESECAKE at the CHEESECAKE factory. Upon his return he told us that he would be unable to serve us cheesecake as they didn't want to open the refrigerator and have the food spoil. We were all very disappointed but whatever. About 20 minutes later we get our check, no discount, but the server forgot one's person's entree and didn't care to fix it. We pay like the law-abiding citizens we are and leave sans cheesecake. HOWEVER upon walking out we see waiters walking by with CHEESECAKE! We stopped at the front to ask and the manager said he had changed his mind and would we like to purchase some to go. Um no, F you and your cheesecake I will go elsewhere. So overall I had a mint julep which was excellent and the skinnylicious shrimp tacos.

The Mai tais are deadly strong for some reason. I love their long islands better. If only their drinks were cheaper but you get what you pay for. It can get crowded so just be patient.

Louie F.,"Santa Barbara, CA",182,291,80,4.0,7/1/2010,"I must say, the worst part about eating at the Cheesecake Factory (any location), is figuring out what to order. The menu is huge and the advertisements abundant. I'm not sure if I should order the Navajo sandwich or a diamond watch! In any event, I've never had a bad meal here. The dinner bread they serve is delicious and usually steaming hot when it arrives to your table. The avocado egg rolls are by far the standard I compare all other restaurants too.  I've had many entrees from the menu, but the the Chicken & Biscuits has to be my favorite by far. The chicken is tender and moist while the biscuits are fluffy. However, the magic really happens when they dump gravy over the entire dish! Now we're talkin!  Now to the dessert...the item that gives this restaurant its name. The cheesecake here is so creamy and rich that you find yourself planning the rest of your meal around having room for dessert.

My wife ordered the Hawaiian salad again sub-par.  Our youngest had the macaroni and cheese that was again poor quality.  We all liked the appetizer (firecracker salmon).  Myself, My Wife our oldest and our youngest all became sick after the meal.   I would love to meet the idiot with the spreadsheet that convinced Cheesecake Factory corporate to stop placing quality as the central goal of CCF and shift it to profits.   Sure you will make millions for a couple of years.  Then CCF will end like a thousand other great restaurants that were bean counted into oblivion.  So sad, yet so typical of corporate America today.  I am sure the idiot with the spreadsheet will be promoted when the beans are counted and he/she will be the one with the golden parachute when it comes crashing down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=760

He apologized (actually he said, oh let me check on that) and a server came over. She introduced herself and told us that although she was not our server, she would be happy to get us a drink while we wait. She did, in fact, get us our drinks and even put in our appetizer. The bread came out - we had no plates. The appetizer came out - we had no silverware. You get the drift... We were anxious to get out of there and asked for our bill. We give her the credit card and she runs our card for a $60 bill.

Angela T.,"Van Nuys, CA",2,6,,1.0,5/17/2015,"I've been coming to this Cheesecake for years and I've always been served the absolute best meals accompanied by the best service, which makes writing this review a bit painful. I came to have an early dinner with my parents and we were seated quickly on the outside patio which was quite empty. Our server whose name was Nora and who's the reason why I'm writing this review, was extremely rude and needs another class on how to deal with customers. She didn't greet us, or even make eye contact. She seemed irritated. She asked what we wanted to drink and then our food order. She gave us bread that was sitting on ANOTHER TABLE, so it goes without say that the bread was cold and stale. We ordered soup as our appetizer and she brought that in about 10 minutes. As we're waiting for our food, the outside patio begins to get full and we see people ordering their meals and receiving them shortly after. 40 minutes pass and we call her over and ask her to check on our food. We didn't even know if she acknowledged our question or not because she just walked away. I then noticed her walking to the register and imputing something in the computer. (perhaps our order that she forgot to put in 45 minutes ago?) She comes back 5 minutes later and says the food should be coming out shortly. My father asks her for paper napkins and she looks at him and says, ""Anything I could bring you while you're waiting?"", my father repeats again, ""Paper napkins please"" and she turns her head away and rolls her eyes. Another glorious 15 minutes pass and we see her walking to our table with my mothers and fathers food. She tells me that she's going to go bring mine now. My father ordered his usual plate which was a jambalaya pasta, but it looked more so like a jambalaya soup. He specifically asked for no onions but behold! There were onions. I won't even bother saying how long I had to wait for my food to come, but let's just say my parents were already finished with their food. (What was the point of a family dinner again?). The manager or whoever it was who brought out my food, said my steak Diane was over cooked and that they had to remake it. He said he would take it off the check, which he did. Very long story short, I work in the retail industry which is quite similar to the food industry and we all have our bad days but we never throw it out on our customers. What was supposed to be an enjoyable family dinner, turned into nothing but frustration and anger, and not the best dishes. All I ask, is for better customer service. I don't need meals to be comped off (although it was appreciated), but for servers to show RECOGNITION towards their customers. All in all, extremely disappointed in how we were treated by our server and the kitchen staff with our food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680
Ms I.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,148,,1.0,11/3/2011,"It is unbelievable in this economy that CF doesn't take reservations for large parties. They are very elitist and have to keep up that ""you must wait for a table"" image. For my sister's birthday, they refused to make a reservation, so were forced to wait an hour for a table for 15 people. Really, really? The food is always excellent and the portions are huge. But no food is worth an hour wait in this situation. This would make sense why they consistently score low for customer service reviews of their chain. I was going to give them 3 stars, but I decided they deserved 2. Not sure if I'm going to go back. Doubt they will notice, since there's always a wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680
Peter B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",39,85,2,2.0,5/22/2012,"Occasionally, we will go there because it is close to our home, and the area is nice. That said, there is ALWAYS a rediculously long wait for dinner, and they don't take reservations. One thing that got us upset was our last visit there with friends, just last Sunday the 13th. We sat on the outside patio and had our three kids with us, who were playing near the table. They were not bothering anyone, were not loud, nor disruptive. One of the waiters made a snyde remark stating ""this is not a playground"", which none of us appreciated, and I had to have a word with his manager. If you ever go there, he is about 5-11 +/-, caucasion, little to no hair (Light colored), about 190 lbs. and a trimmed beard. When you see him, remind him that it is customers like us who are the reason he makes money to pay his bills, and above all, to mind his manners!  It is wait staff like him who cost businesses money. I should know, I have fired a few of them in my day when I ran restaurants in NYC. There is no room for rotten attitudes like yours pal!  I, for one, will request a different table If he is our waiter next time we go there.  FYI attitude boy, if there was an issue for you to do your job, there are better ways to ask for a person's help NICELY. Now go awa, table 3 needs more bread!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680
Lisa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,33,6,3.0,4/14/2015,"I came here the other day to get desserts. I ended up ordering a pasta after carefully telling the waitress that anything with meat (aka animal) products I can not have.  She checked with the kitchen to make sure it was something I could eat. She was very helpful and friendly. The thing that did bother me though, was that I ended up ordering a cheesecake only to find out the day after, from a random friend, that it contains gelatin (an animal product) I wish the waitress would have told me that since I was so strict on my pasta order. I ended up calling in to find out what I ate,  thank Gd it turned out that the specific cheesecake that I ordered was one of the few that did not contain gelatin.  This time I came out very lucky, but still a very close call. They need to let more ppl know about the gelatin,  I think many ppl would be disappointed to know that most of the cheesecakes contain it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680
Marissa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",322,196,3,4.0,6/6/2011,"What can I say? Huge menu, good food, amazing cheesecake and a full service bar.  I've been here several times and the only thing I'm weary of here is how crowded it gets. It really affects the service sometimes. Other than that it's a great Cheesecake Factory location! My favs are the meatloaf, Evelyn's favorite pasta, corn cakes, and the cobb salad. I'm sure there's more but I can't recall past that cause now I'm hungry. lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680
Mariam K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",3,12,,3.0,7/31/2014,"I think their like seeing people staying outside.They had empty table but people are waiting ! We were there last Sunday July 27 and it was not good.Too much waiting and the service was not nice enough. The only reason we choose this restaurant were we knew the menu and we want to have all the friend nice time together but instead we just talked about why she is slow and how she forgot everything, even the coffee were cold!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680
Ernie P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,13,15,4.0,7/8/2014,"I stopped by two weeks ago for a business lunch.  The food and service was very good, however the temperature was very low, It will have been more comfortable if the room was at a nicer temperature.  Yes will come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680
Spencer K.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,367,33,4.0,11/30/2013,"I'm quite surprised how expensive this place is.  The cheesecakes are awesome, but the portions seem to have gotten smaller over time.  Happy hour here is a good deal, which has drawn me back a few times already.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680
Andrea B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",6,97,11,3.0,2/19/2014,The buffalo blasts are to die for. Other than that I dont have too many other things on the menu that I am crazy about. The salmon/ steak combo very BLAND!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680
Lianne O.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",17,255,59,1.0,11/10/2014,"The taste of the food was really good. The waiters/waitresses were good. The wait time after ordering food was awful! My party of 6 ordered food and we waited about 20 mins and a family of 5 sat next to us and ordered their food. We waited another 15-20mins and the family's food came out and they ate. We waited another 25 mins and the family finished eating, got their check and left. The manager came over and told us ""sorry for the wait your food should be out soon"" and left. We ended up waiting close to an hour and a half. All of our food was cold except two pasta dishes which they said they messed up on. The pasta was half cooked and half hard(uncooked). Will never return!!I've never waited hours for food that was served cold. Cold steak, salmon, shrimp, and spaghetti with a meatball was so unpleasant. They didn't even offer free dessert or comp the drinks or an entree. It would have meant a lot to us if they truly showed they were sorry they made us wait that long while a family next to us came, ate and left happy. So upsetting paying $120 for the worst experience ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680

Michelle K.,"Cerritos, CA",231,120,31,4.0,8/27/2013,"Cheesecake Factory usually doesn't disappoint. Our waiter was awesome, super attentive, and the wait was only like 10 min(yay!).

Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2742,19397,2.0,2/17/2011,"The first Cheesecake Factory I ever went to was in Beverly Hills--right before Cheesecake Factory exploded and became one of the more popular chain restaurants in the U.S.  I remember the large menu and the large portions.  Not much has changed.  Even though I felt their portions had actually gotten smaller a few years ago, that was definitely not the case at this very busy Cheesecake Factory located in the Sherman Oaks Galleria. This Cheesecake Factory is similar to all the other ones in terms of atmosphere--big and very crowded with a more upscale decor than most family chain restaurants. The complimentary bread was (as typically is the case) served warm.  There was a crusty French bread and a more hearty, flavorful and sweet pumpernickel bread. I tried their crabcakes (from their appetizer menu).  The crabcakes had a crunchy, deep-fried outer shell.  The center of the crabcake was better than I expected--moist and warm with a good portion of crab meat.  The crabcake was garnished with a bold mustard sauce and a tartar sauce. My entree was the Crusted Chicken Romano, which was kind of a play on Chicken Parmigiana.  The chicken breast was flattened and coated in a romano-parmesan crust.  Not really breaded like a chicken parmigiana--just a fried cheese crust.  The chicken was good.  Moist enough and a good flavor. The chicken was served with a large portion of spaghetti in a tomato sauce.  The pasta was not swimming in tomato sauce like other places--really just lightly tossed in tomato sauce.  The spaghetti noodles were fine and cooked okay, but the sauce was quite salty. For dessert, we tried the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake, which a Yelper recommended to me.  The cheesecake had a fudge cake base and was topped with chocolate cheesecake, a vanilla mascarpone mousse and a chocolate ganache top.  The cheesecake was garnished with whipped cream and an arty display of vanilla and chocolate sauces around the plate. I prefer a lighter cheesecake to the dense cheesecakes found at The Cheesecake Factory.  This one was good though because the vanilla mascarpone was light and creamy and provided a good and needed contrast to the rich and chocolatey cheesecake. Service was good.  The waitress was personable and food came out quickly.  Other servers were polite and helpful. I hardly ever eat at Cheesecake Factory anymore, but this one seems like an okay version of it.  So if you are a Cheesecake Factory fan, this seems like a safe place to stop. Parking is available in the paid structure adjacent to the Sherman Oaks Galleria.  Cheesecake Factory validates parking for 2 hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-sherman-oaks?start=680
