Bethany A.,"Evanston, IL",312,315,50,2.0,2/16/2016,"I'm not the biggest fan of the Cheesecake Factory to begin with, but I stopped by with a friend for lunch earlier last week. We were seated upstairs and got our bread and water relatively fast, and I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which is usually pretty good (out of Cheesecake Factory offerings). Unfortunately, I was really surprised and unhappy with how salty the dish was. I couldn't decide whether I just misremembered how the sauce was supposed to taste, or they had oversalted my dish. Overall, not the best lunch experience in the world and will probably go back to avoiding the Cheesecake Factory for another year. My friend did seem to like her Oreo cheesecake though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80
D M.,"Evanston, IL",0,11,15,2.0,10/8/2016,"Its a bitter sweet review this time...let me explain,  the food was good but the service..not so much. Steven the (waiter) brought our drinks but soon after that like houdini..he disappeared and didn't come back to take our dinner order. I had to get the attention of another waiter to place our order (wow). Steven eventually returned with a not so friendly demeanor  ( worse than before)..im not sure if I will ever return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80
Bill H.,"Chicago, IL",17,31,2,3.0,12/7/2016,"Desserts on steroids. If they are ""known"" for cheesecake then I'm at a loss, our peanut butter n chocolate cheesecake had 5 superfluous layers and a super sweet over the top "" frosting"" . Waaaay to much much going on.  Of course the portions are too big but every one knows this .  Way too much dressing on my salad.  Chicken salad sandwich is served on grilled bread which was cold when I received it. Bland.  Wife had crusted shrimp pasta salad, good.  Waitress was excellent.  Decor was weird.  Bill for 2 parents , 2 kids , one cocktail and 2 desserts was over $100 with tip. Wow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80
Jeffrey H.,"Skokie, IL",9,45,27,4.0,1/30/2016,"We took our 12 yr old to the cheesecake factory for dinner. It was her choice for her birthday dinner. What a really nice restaurant. It's a huge restaurant so I'm glad it wasn't rush hour. We may not have ever gotten our food. Not that it was slow, but when there is a rush it can be a long experience. That wasn't the case though. We had a wonderful dining evening. Our bartender was very funny and her drinks were tasteful, not watered down. She served us herself and was very personable. We had potstickers and chicken wontons for appetizers and both were very good. We were going to order another order of the wontons but wanted to save room for our entrees. And as for the entrees, big portions. I got the American burger, 13oz cooked medium, it was perfect. My wife ordered Beef medallions that were wonderfully cooked and my daughter got a pasta dish, both were off the skinny menu. Great concept, the skinny menu. It's for folks that are watching what they eat and calorie counting. My in laws also were very pleased with their entrees too. All in all we had a good time. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80
Diana E.,"Skokie, IL",0,7,,3.0,6/5/2017,"Really my rating is 2.5 stars.  We always get the same thing every time we come here and usually love it.  Today, everything was not prepared to standards.  Either the cooks were new or they changed how the items were prepared -- nothing was right.  We ordered six items amongst all of us and nothing looked or tasted right.  Service was also sub-par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80
AJ M.,"Chicago, IL",89,488,1368,3.0,6/24/2015,"Alot of people want to hate on this place because it is a chain, but let's be honest it's prb one of the better chain restaurants out there. The menu pretty much has everything covered. From brunch to asian, pastas, steaks, salads, and burgers it's a pretty extensive menu. I love the bread they give you in the begining. The wait for food can be a drag though. With the menu being so big there are some misses, but for the most part it's pretty good. I love the tex mex egg rolls. Not a big cheesecake fan but they do have a flavor for everyone! But as others have said I must agree it is not what it used to be, but still worth a visit especially for lunch or brunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80
Jane W.,"Baltimore, MD",1156,635,1484,3.0,10/30/2013,"Overpriced, not-so-great food.  1. Setup of this place is bizarre. First floor is completely empty (almost eerily so) and you have to walk up a flight of stairs (or take the elevator) to the second floor. 2. Food is way overpriced for what you get. I dished out $13 for a bowl of chicken chili, and my food buddy paid almost $20 for a serving of fish and chips. Now don't get me wrong, I'm willing to dish out money for GOOD food. $60 for a hearty meal at Avec? Sure. $250 per person at Alinea? Glad to. But for what you get, definitely not worth the price. 3. Service is good and attentive. Sometimes a bit hard to flag down your waiter/waitress, but nothing to really complain about. 4. Their famed cheesecake (I mean, it IS called the CHEESECAKE factory) is mediocre as well. Overly sweet and almost tastes a bit processed. Tried the pumpkin pecan and was not particularly impressed.  Average all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80
Heidi B.,"Glenview, IL",421,94,492,5.0,11/22/2014,"I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory and I LOVE this location! My husband and I have tried many things on the menu and have never been disappointed. My favorites are the Luau Salad and the Oriental Chicken! It is all very filling, so it's smart to pick something from their appetizer page (of their novel of a menu), so you can save room for their namesake, the Cheesecake! They have a wide variety of cheesecake options, and while I can get adventurous, I'm all about the classic original. It's always good! The staff here is very friendly and helpful, I'm so surprised that people said negative things. I would recommend this place to anyone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80
Nick R.,"Skokie, IL",149,182,62,3.0,12/17/2014,Solid food and always enjoyable to come here. Huge menu with lots of delicious options. But after my last meal Id say they were losing their touch. The prices here seem to keep increasing to the point where they are now insulting.  I ordered the club sandwich which was $13.50. The chicken Madeira is 17.50 far to expensive for any chicken dish in a chain restaurant.  They got rid of the polenta fries which was one of our favorites.  We instead got the stuffed mushrooms which had no flavor.  The mashed potatoes were poorly made there were massive chunks of potatoes in there like they were hardly mashed.  Our server was unattentive and distracted and didn't bother to bring us bread until we asked for it.  Yes I would come back here because it's close and has a huge menu but I hope they take notice and step up their service and food quality to match their prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80
Hanch R.,"Chicago, IL",6,7,,1.0,9/2/2016,"Service was great but the food quality not. Medium rare steak was burnt on the outside Pasta was under cooked and the sauce wouldn't  mix well inside.

Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",949,833,616,3.0,11/17/2014,"It had been years since I visited this location, I used to dine here often when I worked nearby, but on a visit last week, I was pleasantly surprised by the great service and decent food here. I think this Old Orchard Cheesecake has consistently better food and service over its counterparts in downtown Chicago and other locations.  After perusing the menu, which looks more like a phone book than a menu (lots of food options and hasn't changed a bit in years!), my friend and I both ordered burgers, she got a regular and I got a mushroom with Swiss. The well done was good, not burnt, and my side salad was decent (though I should've ordered fries). Regular cheesecake for dessert was tasty. Our waiter was prompt and professional. Reminder that they don't take reservations. Overall, good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80
Heather P.,"Chicago, IL",268,362,120,3.0,4/7/2015,"I went here for a girl's night and it was great! It was strange because you enter from downstairs, but then have to proceed up the stairs to the podium where the hosts are situated and it's the only area for seating as far as I know. This was a little bit confusing when I first got there, but once I figured it out everything went well. The hosts were really friendly and helpful when I was asking about whether where I parked was alright.  I hadn't seen the girls I was with in 13 years so we spent about four hours at our table, but never felt rushed and we were able to joke around with our server - he made the night that much more fun. All of us were able to find something to please our pallets and made sure to save room for the cheesecake dessert. The variety was nice since one of the girls was on a diet and was able to find something, another girl had dietary restrictions that the restaurant was able to accommodate and I just couldn't decide between three items. I ended up with a spicy chicken pasta that was well made and the portion was big enough that I had leftovers for lunch the next day. The only complaint is that everything looks and sounds so good, it's difficult to choose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80

I'm all about the view and the beauty of where I am sitting. This Cheesecake Factory is unlike any of the others. I love the second floor dinning. I go here quite frequently, whether if it's for meeting a friend, a date, a family sit down or just a casual noshing session after walking thru the Old Orchard Mall. I'm pretty sure I've tried everything on the menu, (they have a large selection/variety of food). I would order these avocado egg-rolls, as an appetizer, you will not regret it.

So we will not be going back to the Skokie location anymore. It seems that all the Chicago and Chicagoland locations have gone a bit down hill. Food quality is hovering near the toilet. Been going to Cheesecake Factory since 1995. Probably my last time going to one. Plus waited 20 minutes to even see a sever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80

Timothy S.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,2,,2.0,8/23/2015,"I've been here a few times for larger family dinners. I love the food especially the new menu options they just added. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the service we have received that last few times. Was just there last night and we started off the evening waiting 20 mins just for a glass of water. I've been a server before and can tell when a restaurant is short staffed on a busy night, but no apology the entire night is just plain ignorant. I also ordered a few apps before my meal and only got one of them. Another 20 mins go by and the server finally comes up and asks if I ever got my other app, when I say no he tells me they ran out... Everything else went fine for the most part till the end. We sat and waited again just to get dessert, I had to get up and walk to the front to get my own menu. When were ready to pay we were more than done playing the waiting game and asked another waiter to take our payment.  The issue that really put me over the edge is that it seemed that every server was more interested in closing and getting all their closing duties done than helping the customers that were there. Only reason I would ever go back is being forced to for family get togethers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=80

Connie C.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",286,5,5,2.0,8/24/2016,"My past experiences have been pretty great here, but today, the hostess was pretty NOT on point. Julianna might be her name. I stood by the hostess table for a few minutes before she bothered to stop talking to her coworker to help me. After I had advised her that we would have a party of 8, she did tell me half of my party had to be here for us to be seated, which was totally understandable. However, after the whole party arrived, I went on to tell her that we were all here, and she told me it would be another 5-10 wait for them to prepare the tables. I had to wait another few minutes at the hostess table until she acknowledged me.  I'm fully aware that I do not deserve any special service nor do I feel entitled to it, but please do your job well. Especially when people are pouring in for dinner.  It really puts a bad taste in my mouth straight from the beginning. Also, my friend had a very similar experience with he same hostess.

If you've been to both, you can tell there is some relations.  Most of their food is frozen if you weren't aware of that. We asked about a couple items on their menu and they said they couldn't change it anyway because it's ""ready made"" or something. The food is delicious though! I just feel kinda sad that I'm paying a lot for frozen food.  Service was above average. Our waiter did a great job of checking up on us and offering suggestions. She knew the menu very well because she knew what can and can't be modified to our liking. HUGE HUGE space! You can bring groups here and have a good time in their neat ambiance.  Yes I'd come back!

Shannon C.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,1,,1.0,8/24/2016,"Very weird lunch experience here today. Throughout our time ordering, the server would keep suggesting smaller portions, or simply not ordering what we wanted at all, to us instead of what we were actually wanting. I ordered two children's pasta plates for my two boys and a side a fries for everyone at our table to share, and the server tried to suggest the fries would be too big. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad for myself, and again the server suggested it is too big for lunch and would I maybe like something on the lite menu? Then, at the end of the meal, he brought us our check without asking if we wanted cheesecake and said we probably wouldn't want dessert because (again) it was lunch time, and we probably wouldn't want any. I informed him that yes, we did indeed want cheesecake (to take home) and had the check redone.  His behavior was borderline offensive and definitely annoying. I don't need a server offering his opinion on if a portion is too big for me or my family, if I want to order something on the lite menu instead (rude!), or simply assume I don't want cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory.

Brenda R.,"Winnetka, IL",0,35,,2.0,1/3/2017,"All these years of dining at Cheesecake but yesterday experienced a pathetic dinner: overpriced (the $17.50 seems the minimum for so-called entrees) and erratic service. The fish and chips was actually 4 small fish nuggets and a small handful of bland, overcooked, not fresh french fries.  The pasta w/chicken and shrimp--served to our an adult man--likewise overpriced but under-portioned--the chicken and shrimp, like my fish and chips, were in the shape of teeny nuggets. If they want to overcharge diners, then stick with adult portions to justify the policy.

Tom K.,"Deerfield, IL",1,42,,1.0,4/6/2017,"Curbside to go at this location has messed up numerous orders in the past. After a long break from them, I gave this one another chance and they screwed up again.  I ordered a side and they passed it off that it was in the box and I had to show them that it wasn't for them to get it off my bill. They tried to charge me for something that wasn't in my bag. So this time I finally wrote on Yelp. Years ago, a cockroach crawled out of my date's dinner plate and a manager comp'd her dinner but not mine. With such bad customer service it's amazing how this location stays in business. There's a lot of people traffic at Old Orchard so they don't need to care. Avoid this location.

Rafi A.,"Northbrook, IL",223,150,1282,5.0,8/2/2015,"I must have eaten here ten times but never have I enjoyed the place so much. I asked the maitre de and two other servers whether they prefer the Tuscan Chicken over other entrees. All of them said to get the Tuscan Chicken; now I know why. It started with grilled, moist chicken which was covered with grilled cherry tomatoes, capers, broccoli, artichokes and fresh basil. The entire menagerie was doused in a balsamic vinaigrette. The dish was filling despite being under 600 calories. My sons could not finish their Cashew Chicken, so out of the goodness of my heart, I cleaned up after them. Their dishes were very well prepared, but much heavier. Nothing Lo-cal about them. As always, the environment was festive and fun.

It was a Thursday night so we were seated briskly. I have to say, I love how open this restaurant is and all the warm colors. The lighting also provides a very romantic, relaxing feel. Our waitress had a very unfriendly demeanor and looked annoyed throughout our entire meal. I do not think I saw her smile once...seriously, why are you even in this business? Aside from that, the food was good. The menu offers a large variety so it's quite hard to decide. Both my guest and I decided to settle with salads. I ordered the Luau salad- it was seriously bigger than my head! Not to mention, it was pretty good! It's filled with so many mixings so this salad is super filling!- grilled chicken, pineapple, cucumbers, peppers, green beans, carrots, onions, crisp wontons, and peanuts! Like wow- talk about a salad! My other guest ordered the Santa Fe salad and said the dressing, the spicy peanut vinaigrette, was divine. Surprisingly, at the end of the meal, I was stuffed!

Chrissy S.,"Morton Grove, IL",189,55,93,5.0,7/6/2015,"Def love this restaurant...it never fails. I'm usually somewhat skeptical about large chain restaurants with ridiculously long menus, but every time I come to Cheesecake Factory and try something new it's always on point.  I started out looking through the cocktail portion of the menu. Everything sounded really good, but I went with the pineapple Moscow mule. It came with stoli vodka, pineapple juice, lime juice, topped off with ginger beer, and a fresh piece of pineapple as a garnish. It was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  I got the spin dip as an app (my go to appetizer). It came out hot with fresh tortilla chips, a side of sour cream, and a side of salsa. Also very delicious. The portion size was pretty big though so be careful when ordering apps here if you want a actual entrée bc it's going to be a lot of food.  I got an appetizer as my entree bc I wanted to save room for dessert. I got the corn masa tamale cakes and they are to die for. They are also a really good gluten free option.  I obviously ended the meal w a piece of cheesecake. They have a whole two pages on the menu and the only problem I had was choosing which one to get bc they all sounded amazing. I settled w the lemon meringue cheesecake, and it was another home run. It was not too heavy (which is my usual complaint about cheesecake) and was amazing.  Cheesecake Factory is a little pricey but totally worth it. The food, desserts, and drinks are amazing. Our server was also very good, checked on us a lot (but not in an annoying way), and we never had a problem trying to find him.

I remember the first time I tried this place, I think I ordered turkey club with fries. The fries were hard as hell, felt like it was burnt to crisp. The food portions are pretty big. I've tried other items on the menu such as pepperoni pizza, shrimp angel hair spaghetti, and shrimp tacos? They were pretty decent. Their desserts are pretty good, too. I remember trying their chocolate tower truffle cake, but I couldn't finish it because the portion was kind of big. I've also had their strawberry cheesecake which was so good.

Fast forward several years.....this place is horrible now. The food quality is horrid.  Went today with my mom for a quick lunch.  I ordered an old favorite of mine - 4 cheese pasta with chicken.  It came out completely different.  It use to have chunks of fresh mozzarella, dabs of ricotta, and fresh basil sprinkled on top of the penne and marinara.  Not anymore.  For $17, I got about 1 cup of penne mixed with some nasty red sauce with hard chunks of onions and it was oddly seasoned - like  booze and spicy all in one.  The chicken, I am pretty sure was trimmed fat and yuck, because it was not even edible. My mom ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad.  She said it was okay, but nothing like the flavor it use to be. The server....where was he after we ordered??  No clue.  When he came by with the check, he asked if everything was ok?  Before we could answer is was walking away?!?! Whatever. Won't be back.

While I took well over 10 minutes to get there due to lunch time traffic, the order was still not ready and I spent 20 minutes waiting at the restaurant.  The cashier was accommodating after the orders were put under the wrong names and they had to be refunded and re-charged. I understand that there were a couple separate checks, but that should not be difficult if you have been instructed correctly on how to take those complicated orders.  After finally getting all of the food for our orders I made it back to find some of the orders were not correct and it was cold from the time spent waiting. The lettuce in my salad was all wilted-gross. My sandwich looked like it was thrown into a to-go container. The hot food we were supposed to have fresh, was cold.

Standard fried fare--typical 20 burger menu where they vary by a couple of ingredients.  Large salads, pizzas and a few halfway decent entrees for those of us of a certain age who have to worry about how much grease we want in our arteries.

Its a cheesecake factory and they have great service.  I've never had a bad experience here.  Usually there is a big crowd, but I think the size of the place helps to accommodate the amount of patrons that show up. Once there my wife and I typically get an Iced tea or a vodka lemonade..  depend on how sassy I feel that day.  It's usually for lunch.   we always always have to start off with the Avocado egg rolls... why you may ask.. because they are some of the most delicious things ever created by the Avocado gods.  The sweet pesto like sauce they serve with it on the side just goes so well with them... they are always on point and consistent with them.  do it!! get them!

Lauren D.,"Chicago, IL",165,372,,2.0,1/31/2015,"They had several choices that were slightly under 500 calories. Prior to going here I went on-line to look at their nutritional menu. I was shocked how much sodium is in nearly every dish. I mean well over 800, and some dishes have over 1,000 or over 1,500 mg of sodium. I ordered from their Skinny-licious section, where items are under 500 calories. I had the Skinnylicious grilled turkey burger, and scraped off all the condiments on the burger. I didn't eat the bun either. The grilled turkey burger was seasoned nicely. It was moist and tender and perfectly cook. However, the black pepper overpowered the burger. For this reason, 3-stars. BTW, my turkey burger came with a small side salad with a variety of greens (no tomato, no cucumbers, nothing else) Basically, a plain and boring salad that was very, very soggy. I didn't eat the salad. However, if you order their ""regular"" Turkey Burger you will inhale 1,370 calories and 1,630 mg of sodium (salt). Definitely not a healthy choice! On the other hand, my husband ordered a double burger which was huge and a mess to eat. It was topped off with four crispy onion rings, loaded with caramelized onions, bacon, cheese and bar-b-q sauce. He said he really liked his burger and rated it with 4-stars. His burger was 1,580 calories and contained 2,990 mg of sodium. Wow, a heart attack waiting to happen! His burger came with fries. He shared a few with me, which were very good. We ended up ordering an extra side of fries without salt. The fries were the highlight of my meal.  We also ordered chicken samosas as our appetizer. Four were served, and they were very, very small and bland. The exterior was crispy, light and flaky. These samosas were served with a dipping sauce. I tasted the creamy white dipping sauce sprinkled with some tiny green specks. It was incredibly bland, and another disappointment. I was expecting these samosas to be similar to the ones we have eaten at Indian restaurants. They were not.  Here is what I walked away with when I counted 166 items on the menu with over 1,000 calories (not a typo) that made me think it must be a very unhealthy restaurant to eat. Too many calories, too much fat, too much refined carbs, too much sodium (salt).  The restaurant was not crowded or super busy considering it was Saturday. We went up the stairs to the second level and were seated immediately near large glass windows. Service was painfully slow. Our water glasses were left empty twice, so we had to keep asking our server for water (otherwise, we never would have gotten a refill on our water glasses). My husband ordered an Apple Crisp to go. I don't eat sweets, so no dessert for me. He said it was ""good"" but nothing spectacular.  This restaurant reminded me of the Rain Forest Cafe, because it is like a gimmick. The interior was gaudy and ornate. We used up our Gift Card and left our Server a generous tip (even though he was awful). Yeah, we tipped him 25%, because we didn't want to come back here again and use up the rest of our Gift Card. Lucky him!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=140

John I.,"Chicago, IL",192,44,,2.0,7/12/2011,"OK i know I can be picky, but I am rating a visit from last night that is fresh in my mind. Took my roommate out for dinner and she loves TCF. So we arrive and there is the typical north shore, crowd, We stick out like a sore thumb, she is a very tall African American Beauty in a dress. I am dressed cool, Not hipster, just old school cool. ( I'm old I know it LOLOLOL) so we wait, and then get seated, I happened to get a phone call, in which I must take so I politely speak at the table the server comes up I motion for 2 minutes and he is annoyed. so I finish the call and order our drinks. then the bread comes and then we sit and wait... then he takes our order.  My Friend ordered the Salmon with I believe it was angel hair pasta. She loved it.  I ordered the lemon Herb Chicken, mash, some carrots and of course, Herbs. We are sitting eating bread, sitting drinking, sitting and I look down at when I took the last call. it has been 30 minutes I stop one of the management, and ask it has been a  while could you please check on our two entrees. Well that did it. with in 45 seconds the waiter is rushing them out to us. Strike two..... The chicken probably was cooked nicely sitting on a  warmer it dried out the white meat and I have to say the consistency in flavor was just NOT there. Some had a lemony flavor and others pieces( the breast meat) was simply flavorless.  After I stopped the manager she would check up on us.

Literally, people clapped. I come now many years after my very first ""Happy Birthday"" shortcake with sprinkles and I find comfort in this Cheesecake Factory-my first Cheesecake Factory. The food's the same, the servers look the same, the bakery with the exception of a number of missing spots in the bakery case looks the same. If they'd bring back the dumpling, I'd be frequently that case more often but that's another story all together. I love how the portions haven't changed, the same staples like the Jambalaya or the Fried Mac and Balls haven't changed a bit. Someday when I have kids, I can show them exactly what mommy grew up on and what exactly have her the infamous ""fat years."" Oh yes, those little suckers will eating at the Cheesecake Factory quite sparingly thank you very much. I notice it's gotten a lot quieter around those parts though. Case in point, at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday night during spring break there was NO wait. In fact there was quite a number of tables open. The bread was hard and not cut into at all and there were a number of servers running back and forth talking not about dressings or what a table needed but sidework.

Kent B.,"Chicago, IL",11,198,34,3.0,2/21/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is located on the east side of Old Orchard Shopping Center. Parking is always an issue here, even though they have a lot of off-street parking. The restaurant is on the second floor and up two flights of stairs. There must be an elevator, but I didn't  notice one. Four of us came for dinner and we were seated in a room that would accommodate about 30-people. We had two female servers. They were polite, but a bit overly attentive and uncoordinated. The menu is a large, comb bound, full-color thing peppered with advertisements for other stores in the shopping center. Seemed a bit tacky to me even though I was eating in a mall restaurant. I ordered Chicken Bellagio ($14.95), which included two pieces of pounded and battered chicken covered in prosciutto and arugula. This was served on a bed of basil pesto spaghetti (smothered in olive oil). The food was delicious and served on a very hot plate. However, the oil soaked spaghetti made me nauseous for well into the next morning. I don't want to know how many calories I consumed.

J C.,"New York, NY",7,32,3,1.0,6/11/2012,"So, my friends are obsessed with this place. I have no idea why. It's weird because we usually dine at pretty upscale restaurants, and The CF is pretty much an amalgamation of all that we despise when it comes to dining. It really is a ""factory,"" serving mass-produced, bastardized versions of various cuisines and poorly executed American dishes. And yet, it tries to sell itself as some kind of ""fine dining"" experience, which really is quite delusional on their part. I went here for the first time in 10 years last week, and I was bluntly reminded as to why I had stayed away from this place for so long. First off, it took 20 minutes before a waiter even noticed us. Mind you, this was at 2 p.m. when the restaurant was two-thirds empty. When our server finally took our orders and got us water, she asked us if we wanted any bread. Um, we've been sitting here for over a half hour, and you ASK us if we wanted FREE bread? What did you think we were going to say? Too bad the bread was so dry I almost wish I had said ""No"" when she asked. I ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta lunch plate, which was described as what would be a ""normal portion at another restaurant."" It was huge, and I really wish it weren't. The chicken was dry, the sauce tasted like thousand island dressing and wasn't spicy enough, and the pasta was severely undercooked. Terrible food, questionable service, tacky decor.

Maria R.,"Streamwood, IL",173,77,441,4.0,4/4/2011,"Ahhhh Cheesecake Factory.....*sigh*  I love Cheesecake Factories as a whole, cheesecake notwithstanding. This particular location is built into the popular Westfield Old Orchard Shopping Center in Skokie, IL.  It's a bi-leveled restaurant that is nicely decorated in a art deco/egyptian style. I always like to bring my mom here for our mom-daughter lunch dates as they have a variety of dishes to choose from.  Oh, and when I say a VARIETY I mean a V-A-R-I-E-T-Y......ALL Cheesecake Factories....ALL of them have HUGE menus! It's like NOT a Cheesecake Factory if you don't have a huge menu. It's 20 appetizers that span like 2-3 pages of their menu, then they have the different sections which are about 1-2 pages each (ex: Pasta, Favorites, Salads/Soups, etc.). So, if you are bringing a large group, chances are, you'll find something for everyone at the Cheesecake Factory. As a whole, Cheesecake Factories (I've only been to the Old Orchard one and the Schaumburg one at least in Illinois.)  tend to be pretty consistent with their dishes.  Whomever they employ as chefs for their various restaurants, do not deviate from their standard.  This particular restaurant chain is based out of California and you can tell by a lot of its fairly healthy dishes.  They have dishes that aren't exactly healthy, but you know what I mean! :) The one thing I do not like about this Cheesecake Factory and not that I don't need it, is the stairs to the main dining area on the second floor.  Yes, yes, before you tell me, there IS a elevator at the back of the restaurant, but the intiial mode of transport to the upper level is the stairs.   Now, mind you, I am not the athletic type, far from it, but my mom had a time climbing those steps.  Whomever designed this was I guess going for aesthetically pleasing because the glass window that covers those stairs looks out onto the parking lot and DOES give this Cheesecake Factory a monolithic feel. BUT, I digress....it is minor. :) I just thought I'd mention it for this particular location. :)  Anyway, back to the food and service...the service is great.  Friendly and attentive staff.  We got seated pretty quickly during their lunch rush and our server was quick to take our order.  We got our yummy honey wheat and sourdough bread with butter right away. The one thing I love about Cheesecake Factories that even though they are a chain...they actually change their menus regularly.  They DO keep some of the more popular dishes, but they also add in some new and interesting ones. For an appetizer, we had the Crispy Artichoke Hearts, which my mom commented on enjoying quite a bit.   They came with a remolade, which gave it an added lemon taste to it.  I enjoyed the appetizer as it was tasty and the dip that came with it really added to it. My mom had the Tomato-Basil Pasta, while I kept it ""healthy"" with their Chinese Chicken Salad and their special soup of the day.  The soup was very delicious and the salad is as I remember it from having it many times before. (Consistency! WOO!) We skipped the cheesecake, but if you haven't had their cheesecake before....go get a piece!  My ABSOLUTE favorite is their Red Velvet Cheesecake as I am a total fan of red velvet cake, and pair it with cheesecake. O M G, you will like have a dessertgasm with this one!  My other favorites are the Banana Cheesecake and the sinfully dense, Reese Peanut Cup cheesecake. Heck, ANY cheesecake with chocolate and peanut butter will send you into an instant dessert-coma. :)  But...it's TOTALLY worth it!   Take it with you or eat it there....it's your choice! Overall, I like this location and afterward, you can walk around the mall to work off the cheesecake you just ate. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=180

A lot of the stuff they have can easily be found elsewhere for cheaper-e.g. the popcorn shrimp which we got as a starter. Okay, but nothing spectacular.  Likewise the green chili burger I got was actually pretty underwhelming. The burger was tough, and the chiles were rather bland. I would have asked for hot sauce but our waiter was hard to find.

Annie Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",372,378,,4.0,5/8/2010,"I'm not embarrassed to admit I love the Cheesecake Factory. This one isn't my favourite location, but it's five minutes away from my house, so I always end up eating here with friends. The wait here is usually pretty long, though not as bad as the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove in Los Angeles that I also frequent. They almost always make up for it with good service once you're seated, though. They have a huge menu with a wide variety of dishes. I have go-to dishes for every category, depending on my mood: Appetizer - My favourites are the tex mex eggrolls and the thai chicken lettuce wraps. I wouldn't say the text mex eggrolls are worth the price, but they're SO good. And the thai chicken lettuce wraps come in an enormous plate -- definitely enough for a meal. Soup - Clam chowder! Their clam chowder is so chunky and creamy; I love it. Salad - BBQ chicken salad. Huge portions and really tasty, though there usually isn't that much chicken. I haven't tried any of the other salads, but they all sound really good. Pizza - BBQ chicken pizza. It's the only one I've ever tried, and I like it enough to stick with it. I wouldn't order the pizza here, though -- it's good, but there are better dishes on the menu. Seafood - Miso salmon. Honestly, you can't go wrong with this dish in any restaurant, but it's especially good here. My only qualm is that it's fairly expensive at $19.95. Pasta - Honestly, I've tried almost every pasta dish on their menu, and I don't really like any of them. They're all decent, but I can never finish more than half a dish. The Louisiana chicken pasta is probably my favourite, though the spicy chicken cajun pasta is also good if they don't make it too sweet as they tend to do. Specialties - The Cajun chicken littles are amazing when they're well done. Even if the chicken is dry or burnt, though, it's worth ordering the dish for the mashed potatoes alone. Mmm. The Shepherd's Pie (ground beef, carrots, peas, and onions topped with mashed potatoes) is my absolute favourite dish. If you make it here in time for lunch, order this -- it's only $9.95, and it's big enough that you'll bring home leftovers. Just ask them for minimal oil, otherwise it'll be swimming in grease. My most recent discovery is the shrimp and chicken gumbo. They're really generous with the meat, and the sauce is well seasoned. I find that it doesn't keep well in the fridge, though, so try not to bring home leftovers if you order that. As for the cheesecake part... well, surprisingly, I've only tried one of their cheesecakes (white chocolate raspberry) and I wasn't impressed. I always come into the restaurant and swear I'll order a slice of cheesecake, but I'm always too full after my meal to even look at the dessert menu.

The main focus of complaint was the food & service. My boyfriend's burger was great, fortunately he noticed the inedible peel & outer skins of the grilled onions atop before he bit in. We just asked for the onions to be removed. Biggest disappointment was the chicken & biscuits. The chicken was tough as tho it was frozen. We tell our waiter who really didn't offer a solution, my boyfriend just asked for better chicken. I wanted to send the whole meal back it lacked in flavor. I've had this meal before & it was wonderful. I should've got my usual, chicken Madeira. The manager comes to our table, advises their chicken isn't frozen his solution was ""so u want more chicken?, we won't cook it so much."" We end up just taking the rest of the food to go. They didn't comp anything, they charged us for everything. I realize our waiter & manager didn't even apologize. The worst part is when I got home. I open up the chicken & biscuits. I try the chicken first which was an improvement. But i realized they added the hard bottoms of the biscuits to my meal which were completely inedible. Our meal was $50, which is a lot considering I barely enjoyed my meal. We've spent triple that amount in other restaurants & left satisfied, with no complaints. I honestly feel that my boyfriend & i weren't taken as serious customers. I guess our appearance made them think we wouldn't know good food & service from the bad. We probably won't be returning to any of the locations due to our experience yesterday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=260

For the main I had the blue cheese Cobb Salad which came drenched in its bacon and ranch salad dressing.  After several bites I made mention of it to the bartender/server (i was sat at the upstairs bar), he just said something to the effect of ""hmmm"" and went about his busy business.  It was pretty borderline as to whether or not I send it back but I was starving and in a rush so went with it.   This was prob a 2 star experience but I've done CF before with better results....in sum, a-ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=260

Chris P.,"Evanston, IL",0,36,,5.0,7/8/2015,"The steak diane / salmon combo was perfect tonight (all the times I've come here, I almost always gravitate to the same choice, though I have to say some of the salads are pretty decent too--if you're into salads, that is. I like food that's hearty, tasty, hot and satisfying, and for me, all those chicken dishes on the menu don't quite hit the spot like a juicy piece of steak or fish--both of which were cooked perfectly--tender, juicy and tasty, with lovely sauces and mashed potatoes just the way I like em - a mix of rustic & creamy texture. I started off making a pig of myself with a bowl of rich/dark mushroom soup (there was something of a witch's brew of tasty veg & seasonings in there that did it no harm at all--yum), and some warm/crispy french bread. We don't go here a lot (it's become more of an occasional treat than something like a routine), but it's one that I have continued to look forward to (clearly others feel the same way, judging by the 15-20 minute wait, but the minutes trip by quite nicely when you spend it looking through the menu and browsing the cheesecake counter). I think the point is that there are very few places locally that offer that kind of value, and also come with nice service, easy parking, a location near home, and a relatively short wait (15-minutes).  Risking a post-meal heart attack, we shared a big slab of lemon meringue cheesecake too (not the lightest choice in the huge cheesecake selection, but very satisfying!). I must admit that one previous occasion, the salmon was a bit more 'done' than I'd like, but tonight, everything came together (except for self control), and I feel like a happy king after a banquet.

Get ready for a wait when you arrive for a table. The interior has a more soothing design than the funkier downtown location. The fresh bread is good, the iced tea was not. The chicken madeira was tasty, accompanied with asparagus and a mound of potatoes. The chicken pot pie was massive in size, topped by a frighteningly large puff pastry, but there was something missing (er, flavor?).

Ryan G.,"Arlington Heights, IL",9,18,52,2.0,6/20/2009,"I will start with  few facts about the Cheesecake factory (this location) 1 . Importantly, the manager is not caring for customers.  The waitstaff seems to know this, and has become apathetic towards customer service, knowing nothing will be done to resolve an issue if a customer complains. 2. The menu is too large for the price of the food.  (true of any Cheesecake Factory)  It is abundantly clear that the kitchen cannot keep enough fresh ingredients on hand to make 1-2 day's portions of every menu item X times - and then sell each item for a reasonable price.  What I'm saying is: they use a lot of frozen food to maintain the size of their menu.  Especially at this location, quality suffers terribly.  Their menu is the size of the Space Shuttle crawler transporter.   3. The kitchen here is not terribly concerned with the accuracy of orders.  This is an issue particularly because of point #1. 4. Fries are NEVER good, always dry, as though they were fried hours ago and left under a heat lamp. 5. This location is getting progressively getting worse, not better.   That said, the building is nice.  I used to be a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and other locations may well still be acceptable.  Just be warned, the food is never GREAT, and you will very often have to wait for a table.  (Huge portions + mid-range prices + America = very very busy, all the time)  Truthfully, I would give more stars, but this location needs a few lowball reviews to bring the average down.  A-ok?

I believe the decor is classier, and feels much more upscale then the Schaumburg location housed within the mall. We were seated upstairs and had sole amount of space- not crammed into next to a ton of people. Our server was attentive and came by us multiple times to ask us how we were doing and if we needed anything. Since this is a chain, the food is pretty standardized... However the chicken Madeira that they boost about... It is truly phenomenal. The chicken is moist, and has very good flavor.

Aiming for a light bite, and completely overwhelmed by the beyond ginormous menu, for some reason my eyes landed on the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. I figured it would be fairly small, so I added fries for $1 for all of us to share.  Holy chicken! The appetizer portion was a legitimate meal. Take note, the portions are huge here, and I had no idea what to expect. I also expected my chicken to be pretty basic, but can I just tell you? I enjoyed every bite, and it was so good I fought hard to finish it. The plate came out with sliders piled high and a huge portion of fries. It was really pretty hilarious.  The chicken was tender and lightly crispy with a nice buttermilk batter. The buns were toasted with butter (yep, pretty rich), and the fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned just right. I fully admit that I'm craving the chicken right now. I eat a lot of chicken, and I have to say this was a memorable meal...and I mean meal.

I went at 3:25 to give them extra time ...just in case. It wasn't ready and then they couldn't find the cake. I paid extra for a happy birthday on the cheesecake. Of course it wasn't done. Their excuse was that they had so many cakes in the freezer b/c it was Mother's Day (I ordered mine for a Friday and Mother's Day was not for 2 more days) They should have given me the extra happy birthday piece of chocolate free as a courtesy considering that I had to wait another 30minutes while they tried add the writing. I will never order from here again! This just shows poor management. The restaurant need to reevaluate their system and either re-train their employees or hire new ones. They need a new manager. The food and cake is not worth the poor service! To make my experience even worse- no apology and the they threw my cake at me and was really abrupt and annoyed. I should have asked for the manager ... my problem was that I was didn't get mad but waited patiently. I asked to see the happy birthday writing and then she said it's there in the bag... poor service and she needs a lesson in customer service.  I work in the service industry and would never put up with that type of service from my employees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=40

I nicely asked one the waitress if they could make his food again for its very salty.. she said absolutely and she also mentioned to put the sauce on the side just in case.. very very nice.. and so she went on to find our waiter.. This guy came to our table and was the most unprofessional the most arrogant and waiter I have EVER dealt with.. the gentleman had a man bun and unfortunately I forgot to take down his name.  Standing on top of us he says.. ""Excuse me sir but this dish looks like it's been half way done! If you think it's too salty you should've noticed it from the beginning? But let me see what I can do""  WHAT???!!! ... If im not enjoying my food you are going to stand there and tell me that I should've told you before!?????????  My father in law gave it a chance and if it wasn't for me he would've just left his food there! The guy takes our plate and goes in the back! After 5 mins he comes back and says  ""Would you like a soup or salad while you wait?"" ""Actually maybe the soup is too salty for you too just stick with a salad!"" WHHHaAAaaT?????!!!! You gotta be kidding me!!  He was rude.. unprofessional.. and acted like he was gonna pay for our dinner!

Allison H.,"Madison, WI",3,5,,1.0,4/22/2015,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory with my boyfriend expecting an experience a little nicer than a regular chain restaurant (e.g., Applebee's). Should have just gone to said chain restaurant. After we were seated, it took roughly 10 minutes to be greeted. Our waitress (who I didn't realize was our waitress at the time) went to every single table around us to deliver food, take orders, etc. She even pushed our table a few inches to the side to get in to deliver a plate of food to the people next to us. All she had to do is acknowledge us, say she was slammed, and we would have understood. Instead, she chose to ignore us and leave us waiting. Eventually she came to us and asked for our drink orders. We gave our whole order at that time, since we had ample time to decide.  She dropped off the bread first, drinks a while later. Then when we finally got the food, it was so lackluster. I had the Mexican salad with ""avocados, corn, chicken, sour cream, and hard tortillas."" It was made with shredded lettuce, which is okay on a taco, and tasted like coleslaw. The ""hard tortillas"" we're on the bottom of the whole salad, covered in a black bean & chicken mix, and they were ridiculously soggy. I ate the chicken and called it a day.  My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich, which was served with globs of coleslaw on it. He gets pulled pork sandwiches everywhere we go and I have never seen him so disappointed. I was going to ask the waitress for a different entree because I was so disappointed and starving, but she never came back except to drop off the check.  Terrible service. Sub-par food.

Get the Thai Lettuce Wraps --they're in the appetizer section --but it's a massive plate of luscious vegetable-laden wonder with three dips, all of which entice. They plate it on large leaves of red cabbage ...which I always squirrel away in a napkin to take home, and add to my smoothies and slaw the next day. Why waste a hunk of gorgeous nutrition?

Grace H.,"Evanston, IL",65,102,56,4.0,4/2/2015,"Fancy, affordable, and delicious food!  I have to give this place four stars because it made my mom really happy. She was delighted by the fancy feel of the restaurant- the mood lighting, the soft rock playlist, the booths, and the sweet and kind waitresses.  A lot of people were waiting to be seated, but our wait was only 15 minutes.  The hostess quickly seated us, and the waitress came with ice-cold water. We asked for bread, and the bread was very soft and delicious. We wanted to ask for more, but we refrained because we wanted to save our appetites for the main course.  The menu is a whole booklet, and it also comes with a ""skinnylicious"" menu as well. My brother ordered salmon and rice dish (~20$), and he was impressed by the juiciness of the salmon and its tasteful marriage to the rice.  My mom ordered a turkey avocado burger from the ""skinnylicious"" menu, and I ordered a vegetarian burger from the skinny menu as well. Apparently, these dishes are under 600 calories! (Cheesecake has a bad rep for having extremely caloric food).  I appreciated this menu, because I hate fattening foods. Hate! Now I can still come to these nice restaurants with my family and friends :).  There was quite a lot of turkey on my mom's burger. The burger was more like a sandwich, because there was no patty. However, my mom thoroughly enjoyed the turkey (an inch think) and the avocado slices and the bacon slices.  I, on the other-hand, did not like my veggie burger. The patty was made mostly out of rice and beans. The texture of the rice did not complement the softness of the bread. I took the bun off in the end.. The patty was disappointing. I think morning star offers better patties.  However, the cheesecake is soo goood. We were full by the time we grabbed our dessert forks, but the decadence and richness of the cheesecake made us forget about our bloated tummies for a minute.  -It's a good place to go when you want to treat yourself.

Of course, they're well known for their cheesecake, and the selections are good enough. I would rather stop here for an afternoon cheesecake and ice-cream treat rather than for a full meal. The service is less than average, even though it's not too bad. You will have to wait for quite a bit to be served and the servers tend to forget special requests. For example, I often ask for no onion, less fat etc.., but they forgot half of the time. Sometimes they are nice enough to replace it, sometimes they just apologize and hope that you're ok with it.

The older lady next to us had it alot worse , I'll get to her later. I ordered the salmon over spinach , and the Crab Wontons. The wife ordered the Fettichini chicken and the kid ordered the pepperoni pizza.

She finally got her soup about 5 minutes into out wontons. We then proceeded to wait for our entrees , for 25 minutes after our wantons were long gone , 30 minutes in all. The poor woman next to us finally got her sandwich after sitting with an empty soup bowl for 20 minutes as well. The place was full , but not packed to the gills like the wait would lead us to believe. My wife said the chicken she got was ""alright"" but I could tell she was still really pissed at all the waiting. I actually really enjoyed everything I ate , I gotta admit. While we ate , the woman time forgot finally got her food , and finished it. She called for the manager and the manager calmly explained that they ""were just really busy"" and offered to give her a certificate for a free appetizer ... what a dick. I finished my food and proceeded to wait for the check for another 10 minutes. I contemplated getting dessert , but by the time the server finally got there I was sick of being there. The prices were really high for what we got , I've payed much less for better.  I usually judge restaurants 80% to 90% on the food , putting much less value on service , ambiance and cost.

Natasha R.,"Riverwoods, IL",159,211,686,4.0,9/11/2012,"Out of all the chain restaurants that are not LEYE, Cheesecake has to be my favorite one. Everything is always so delicious, either eating inside or carryout. This ends up being our default restaurant to order from when doing family dinners at home, though we order from the Lincolnshire location since it's closer. I recently dined here, and have to say that I like this location a whole lot more. Mainly two reasons why I like it more, since the quality and taste of the food is primarily the same. This location doesn't have the ""Lincolnshire vibe"" (I am sure some know what I am referring to when I say that) and I the interior is so beautiful and a lot more spacious. I haven't been to any other locations, so I am just judging between these two.  Food - LOVE both the dark and white bread that they give out, esp with butter. Mmm so good, but it fills you up before the real food is served! My favorite dish is the Chicken Madeira which is under their specialties. It's pricey, but it's a HUGE portion and the melted mozzarella cheese on the chicken is absolutely incredible. I've tried three or four of the salads, all are great! Basically, I've never experienced anything bad, nor has any of the people I've dined with. I try to stay away from the cheesecake, but I can admit to having tried it just a couple times and it's always unbelievably good and bad at the same time... can't even imagine how many calories are in once slice! The two I've tried are the red velvet and pumpkin - can't go wrong with those two flavors... EVER!

Natalie S.,"Des Plaines, IL",25,14,29,5.0,7/9/2014,"I really don't know where to start when it comes to the Cheesecake Factory. I tried it for the first time around 6 years ago and I couldn't believe what I had been missing. I am such a fan.  Important points: 1) This is a GREAT place for pasta lovers. Seriously, you don't know what you are missing. ~(The shining star dish is the Louisiana Pasta, which is divine. Crispy breaded chicken on top, bow-tie pasta with a spicy Cajun sauce and small bits of mushrooms and red peppers. They must put some type of drug in this dish because it is that addictive. Also, the Farfalle pasta is to die for. Bow-tie pasta in a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce with a medley of peas, caramelized onions, tomatoes, and tender chicken pieces. My boyfriend and I always have a deeply internal conflict with choosing one over the other, haha. We always end up getting one for him and the other for myself, and then sharing them both. They are both that good. The Evelyn's pasta is also delicious (penne with broccoli, dried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, Kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts.) My mom is obsessed with that one.)~ 2) The portions are ENORMOUS. I am a distance runner and have the appetite of a horse, and twice I have made it my goal to finish my entree, but have yet to make it happen. Maybe because I pig out on so much bread beforehand? Also, the pasta tastes just as amazing the next day! 3) Going off of the second point, the bread is AMAZING! You get both sour dough and pumpernickel. It is so fresh and soft that it just melts in your mouth. The bread is almost as exciting as the meal itself. Also, they bring you as much as you want. The only thing I always find irritating is how difficult the butter is to spread because they take it straight from a fridge, but no complaints.  4) I know that I probably do not need to emphasize this...but the cheesecake is heaven on earth. I love cheesecake and this is the place to get it. I have tried so many different flavors, but my favorite is definitely the red velvet. It is enormous and so rich and delicious. The Godiva cheesecake is so deep and rich, great for lovers of rich cocoa. The oreo cheesecake is great, Reese's peanut butter cheesecake is amazing and huge, dulce de leche is smooth and creamy, banana cheesecake is heavenly. Can you tell I have been here a few times? Haha.  5) The prices at this restaurant make it somewhere to go more for a special occasion. I go here for birthdays (which they have always made special by decorating a plate with strawberry sauce and adorning it with a massive slice of cheesecake 0:]), graduations, anniversaries, that type of thing. Definitely not your casual, Friday night type of budget. When my boyfriend and I go, we get two entrees and a dessert to share (and sometimes a soda), and it is always right around $50. So totally worth it.  6) The food is ALWAYS a hit, but it is true that the service can SOMETIMES be a miss. We have definitely had more good experiences than bad, but if you do get a slow server (won't bring out the bread right when you get there), just ask for it. It has never been a big deal. The staff has always been friendly to us, and never slow enough to be aggravating.  *I think it is important to warn that I do not recommend this restaurant for much besides the pasta. The prices just do not justify their other options, in my opinion. My brother felt like being a king, so he ordered the $25 steak, and was not impressed. I am not a steak lover, but do admit that thing was tiny for what he paid. He received a side of fries with it. Just not worth 25 dollars. Go to Longhorn for that. For pasta though, I insist, you will not find better pasta in bigger portions anywhere else. Best place ever. I have also heard rave reviews about their fried mac n cheese, but have never tried it myself. I love this place! Please give it a try on your special day! And don't leave without getting cheesecake! So worth every penny!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=160
Mikey J.,"San Francisco, CA",360,324,19,3.0,8/20/2011,"Came here with a crew after eating Hecky's turkey legs.  Yes, we were foolish enough to have cheesecake after devouring enormous sticks of meat. Now, I've been here before and have always had a decent time.  I have also had the cheesecake before and was satisfied, but remembered that the slices were incredibly rich and filling. There were four of us, and, recalling the size of the slices, I recommended splitting 2 or 3 pieces at most between the three of us.  But no.  I was vetoed down.  Damn democracy does not work when the parties are uninformed! So we each ended up getting a slice.  Four slices total.  First through fifth bites were excellent.  Then it started to go downhill from there.  Of course, as expected, we reached our limit and began to struggle, I mean really struggle, to finish our slices.  Delicious as they were, by the end we were filled with only feelings of shame and ""Holy shit my stomach is too full, please no more.""  It's like in a crowded train, where two hefty riders are trying to squeeze into those tiny seats next to each other.  The riders are too big, the seats too small.  There is no room.  Now replace the train with your stomach, and the riders with a turkey leg and big ass cheesecake slice. Now you may be scolding us in your head thinking, ""Well it's your fault for eating a turkey leg, then going all crazy and getting cheesecake on top of that.""  Well, you're right.  But it's not an unimaginable situation, as many people eat dinner at the Factory first, then go on to dessert. In economic terms, what happened to us is called diminishing marginal returns.  Layman speak: You'd pay a lot to eat that first bite of cheesecake and boy is it worth it.  By the second or third bite, the amazingness begins to subside.  Keep going and soon enough, you'd actually pay to NOT eat another slice. So be warned!  Damn good cheesecake.  But split that richness with a friend. Or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=160

The portions are big and the flavors are good. Sometimes you might have to wait for 20-40 mins depending on date and time. Over all this is a good place for a date and to hangout.

Laura C.,"Houston, TX",99,357,306,2.0,11/12/2012,"I'm slightly embarrassed to admit I ate at The Cheesecake Factory, but a recent trip to Old Orchard with hungry friends had me acquiescing to this chain restaurant despite my pleas to go somewhere else.   At an off peak 2 PM time slot on a Saturday, we entered to find the first floor completely empty and all business directed to the second floor.  As we climbed the steps, the loud buzz of customers gradually grew louder, and I was shocked at how busy the joint was.  We were seated close to the kitchen pass, where I could see food runners and cooks playing with the food, throwing stuff back and forth, letting food drop to the floor and not picking it up, scraping dirty plates and not bothering to wipe their hands before grabbing the next dish going out to the customers.  It was not a pretty sight.  But it's unfortunately more common than not; I just wish I couldn't see it.  I also witnessed three salads dying in the window, that just sat there the entire time we ate.  I feel bad for the poor soul who had to eat the limp greens. Service was slow; our meals took a good 20 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  With servers and food runners abound, it seemed as if a more efficient modus operandus was in desperate need.  Side note, the uniforms were white pants, white shirts, and white shoes, and I felt a little bit like I was in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" with the orderlies swarming the place.  I felt rushed and uneasy with all the activity and the noise in the room.  Twice throughout my meal, I had food dropped on me, once from a busboy cleaning the table next to me, and once from our server, who took my friend's leftovers into the kitchen (under our assumption that he was going to box the food), and he returned with said leftovers, a take home box, and my dirty plate.  Why he didn't drop the dirty plate off before coming back or why he didn't box up the leftovers in the back, or why he didn't just leave her leftovers at the table and bring out a box made no sense.     Anyhoo, foodwise, I chose the crispy artichokes, a deep fried plate of hearts accompanied by a gelatinous aioli.  Together with a cold beer, it wasn't bad, but certainly not something I would return for any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=240

This weekend I tried the garlic noodles with chicken. The chicken (additional) was basically fried chicken and I was so happy. The garlic sauce was lightish (compared to many of their cream-based sauces) and gave me such crazy delicious dragon breath that I couldn't help but fall in love.  With so many places to eat in this town, I really shouldn't end up here so much, BUT it seems to be a people pleaser (at least when out of towners come to visit) and I can always find something to enjoy here.  The selection of cheesecakes is bananas that I usually don't even end up getting any.

We often pick up (at least twice a month) our dinner using the curbside service.  We did this last night and Cheesecake Factory messed up our order again for the 7th time in the row (in the past months). For spending over $50 for just 2 pasta dishes and 1 salad last night, one would expect better attention to details. We asked for extra sauce for one our our pasta dishes and the complimentary bread that comes with orders. Not only did they not pack the extra sauce but there was little sauce on the pasta to begin with. Also, they did not pack the bread. The last time we ordered something for pick up, they messed up 2 of the 4 orders. I had to drive all the way back from home just to get the correct orders. They were professional enough to apologize for this and offered complimentary dessert (which I turned down as we just wanted to eat our dinner....as that was delayed having to wait for our correct orders). I complained to the Manager about this (again) last night and he did listen and offered to personally pack my next pick up order himself. However, it is my opinion that a customer should not have to go to this level. The Manager of a good establishment should not have to personally get involved and the better focus is to get the crew focused on details. Beware....If you order for pick up or curbside, you better double and triple check your orders.

The menus are filled with advertisements.  I'm not sure who started this trend, but for me putting commercials in your menu is a big red flag that says, ""we're a piece of crap, we don't care how the food tastes, we just want to fatten you up, sell you fancy watches, and later, eat you.  Also, we're aliens."" How tacky is that?  And why do we flock to places like this in droves instead of slapping them on the wrist for pulling such a bogus and unfriendly move?  Could you even fathom pushing advertising to people that come to eat in your house?

Anisha E.,"Gainesville, FL",0,5,,1.0,6/8/2016,"I wish I could give 0 star. I had planned a baby shower months in advance with the manager, Lynn who said I could pick anything from the menu (including appetizers) to be served as meals for a lunch party. I was told we will also get the lower floor since we had estimated about 40-60 guests. I live in Florida. My best friend went to go look at the lower floor, where the party would be, and met with another manager, Michael who said that we have to cater from their brunch menu and that Lynn gave me the incorrect information. (This is more expensive). A week before the party, I went to the restaurant and met with the catering manager,Molly,  and was told that Lynn and Mike should have directly told me to contact Molly because they had given me the wrong information again. Lynn said that I could just directly work with either her or Michael. I was willing to pay more money to host the party again. A few days before the party, Molly called me and said that the bottom floor flooded and they have to give me a room that will hold 40 guests when our confirmed list was 58 and she would squeeze chairs into the room and have more seating extended in the hallway. This would look so awkward and the guests wouldn't be together. Imagine how upset I was that I was accommodating to their lack of communication again such last minute. I asked Molly to compensate something for their lack of professionalism. She knew they messed up and offered me 2 free appetizer. The next day she called me again and said that her boss didn't approve the appetizers so she has to retract them. That's something she should have discussed with her manager before offering to me. I talked to the general Manager, who was so rude, condescending  and sarcastic.  In the end, I canceled the party and held it at a different venue on 1 day notice. I would never host a party there and would advise anyone never to host their special event there.  Their staff is so unprofessional, irresponsible, inexperienced, and do not have any manners.

Michael N.,"Wheeling, IL",37,53,7,1.0,10/3/2014,"I think what's most upsetting about writing this review is that the Cheescake Factory of the 90's in the Chicago area is not what it is today.  Today it's like an old tired restaurant that stopped trying.  I was at the Skokie location twice in the last few months and one time it would have been on about a 3 star level in terms of food and service and the most recent really took a plummet. Mimosa's ordered for the table.  On the weak side and the strawberries in there looked as if they sat around for a week or so.  But hey, alcohol is alcohol so let's not base a 1 star review off of that...just a small contributing factor. My order of fish and fries was not good.  I would have expressed it to the waiter had he come around at some point to check in, but he didn't come around until the end.  At that time I was irritated and more or less had a full plate.  The fish was tiny and tasted burnt.  If you ask most folks, I'm not one to complain about food.  I might say it's so-so, but I'll usually still eat it and possibly give a place another shot. When the waiter returned and asked if I wanted the dish wrapped I said ""No thanks, the fish was overdone and not really edible if you can pass that to the kitchen.""  He said ""ok"" and left.  When he returned we were handed a check for all 3 of our meals.  So let's pause here for a moment...if I'm in some random grab'n go place, then my expectations are not that high.  When I'm being asked to spend $80 for lunch for 3, the expectation goes up a bit. The waiter (which I have been several times) doesn't buy the food, cook it, clean the dishes or the floors.  The waiter delivers the food and makes sure that the front of house interaction goes smoothly for the customers along with possibly wrapping silverware or marrying the ketchup.  So I would expect that when I handed back a pretty much full plate and expressed a concern, that the waiter would take some action.  He chose none of that and ignored the problem.  I still left a tip...why I'm not exactly sure, but it was just a couple bucks and well below the industry standard.  I even regret the amount I left but I basically subtracted the cost of the dish from his tip and left that. I realized from the two trips to the Skokie Cheescake Factory what they lack.  Standards.  The waiters clearly don't seem to care and it's not just from this experience.  The time prior to this visit I was with a group all I personally ordered was coffee and had to ask twice for cream, clearly a very complex ingredient.  It's the standards and attention to even to a basic service which are virtually non-existent.  It's almost painfully clear on several of the waiters faces just how much they can't wait to get out of there that day.  The only thing that could top the experience you're destined to have here is if you go home, open a frozen box of fish sticks, throw them into the fireplace for a few minutes and then have a 4 year old overloaded with muscle relaxers serve it to you.  Because at least the standards of the 4 year old would be higher.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=120
Aunt T.,"Evanston, IL",2,21,,1.0,4/13/2016,"Bacon bits (alleged bacon bits) on the Cobb salad broke off a piece of my bridge. Not a weak or distressed tooth - a $3,000.00 bridge made of state of the art material able to withstand the pressure of an elephant standing on it (or so my dentist claims, lol). My companion had a pit of plastic wrap still adhered to his chicken (wtf?). We told the waitress about the plastic, and that something in the salad (bacon bits was the only ""hard"" item in it) broke my tooth; she just said, ""oh, would you like anything else?"". Uhm... no. No thanks. If their bacon bits (possibly mixed with parking lot gravel?) can chip a tooth, I'd rather not sample anything else from the menu that might cause bodily injury (carbolic acid soup? iced tea with ground glass in the crushed ice?). We didn't make a fuss - just got the check and said never again. NEVER again. Sorry - but I think this place is poorly run, probably has a filthy kitchen (what with broken teeth from salad and plastic stuck to the chicken not being of any surprise to the waitstaff), and their vast menu is nothing more than overpriced pre-made factory foods that anyone can microwave (ConAgra food service type stuff). There is no accountability at this place, and no real ""cooking"" being done. Unless you're so completely dead-arsed lazy you refuse to microwave a frozen entree at home, or thaw out the very same pre-made, frozen cheesecake that they do, save your $$ and ""dine"" elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=120

Since the restaurant front door was locked after 10 o'clock on Sunday, and we (my wife, 10 months old son, and I) just realized that we left something on the table, so I was trying to go back in to see if it was still there; however, as he walked out through the side door, he immediately told me that the restaurant is closed which I said to him ""i just walked out the building, and I left something on the table. Please let me go up and see if it was still there"" (the restaurant was still half full when we left). He apparently didn't not even try to help me and said ""you can't go back in there, the restaurant is closed"".  1st, the restaurant should never lock the front door without anyone attend at the front desk which in my case, I can't go back in just to check on the table. Can you imagine if someone left their car key?  2nd, he didn't try in anyway to help the customer who actually spend money in the establishment to keep your operation running. He didn't realize that his partial salary is from what I spent at the restaurant. Regardless how busy your establishment right now, you definitely lose around $250.00 business a month as of today Mar 13, 2011. We spent $101.00 today with tips and $135.00 2 weeks ago. That's $3000.00 business in a year. The situation would had been different if he tried to call his manager for me or someone to come help me. We have been trying a lot of restaurants(Renga Tai, Maggiano, outback, California Pizza, and Jolane's) as we like to eat out every Sunday.It's very hard to find the restaurant that you like, and I think for the restaurant is also very hard to find someone who would spend $100.00 a dinner with the economy we have right now.     In conclusion, my wife and I haven't been back to Cheese cake Factory for more than 8 years, and the foods were not as good as current. We just go back since 1 month ago because one of my friend recommended the ""Luna salad"", so we go tried and we loved it. As well as the miso salmon, lettuce wrap, and fettucini chicken.

I was expecting more, but I cannot tell you what.  I got one of the salads and it was okay, but WAY too much food!  I don't do leftovers, so that was useless to me too. Then there's the fact that I have kids, and I'll be honest, this place is really disappointing if you have little ones, there's not much on the menu for them and the staff simply said, ""well we have pizza.""  Oh joy!  Yes, for the parents of small children, this is not a relief.. it's an irritant.

In fact, I never get anything else (except the thai chicken wraps).  Their Cobb Salad, Chinese Chicken Salad, Ahi Tuna Salad and Salmon Salad are all fantastic.

For dessert I had white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. So amazing! In June I had the same cheesecake. I also had southern chicken sliders that weren't very good.

I got home, it had about a half inch of frost on it and was freezer burnt. Disgusting, never again. When I called to complain, the manager was not very helpful, seemed annoyed, she could offer a gift certificate, as if I would go back, or to replace it if I drove 40 minutes back to the restaurant. After some back and forth, she became more agreeable and apologetic and took my number, but not my name or card info to call me back to process the refund. She left a voicemail a half hour later saying a refund had been processed. Several days later, the transaction had not come off my card and was no longer pending. When I called the restaurant, another manager insisted it had been refunded and it would drop off. I explained that it was not pending anymore and that I work in financial services and understand authorization holds - this was not an authorization hold. He insisted it had been refunded, and read me the last 4 of the card refunded - not my card - they asked me repeatedly if I had used a different card. I had not. Turns out, goofball manager #1 had pulled up a receipt for the type of cheesecake I had ordered and refunded it, without confirming any info. Good job. Goofball manager #2 laughed about the fact that someone else got a freebie and promised to look into it. On the next call he was able to find my receipt and process a refund. Did I say never again?

Our first weird experience was having the fire alarm go off right after we had our dinner served. Granted, not their fault, but a sucky experience trying to pay for our food quickly and taking home fried fish and chips. Shortly after that, I had a nice chunk of plastic in my pulled pork sandwich. At least they comped it. Tonight we had a little booth next to the wall outside the kitchen. Shortly after we got our drinks, we noticed a little fruit fly darting around our table. A few minutes later, we noticed that there were about 8 of them on the wall right above our heads. Gross. It looked like there was something sticky on the wall. We probably should have just left, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and we had already ordered our dinner and were really looking forward to dinner there. We moved to a booth on the other side of the aisle and were served our dinner. When we were about halfway done, someone went over to the original booth and started wiping down the wall - well guess what happens when you disturb the fruit flies? They fly around to other areas! The manager came over to offer us free desserts, but first, I don't eat dessert and second, I was done at that point. The manager came over literally 3 times to try to make us take the free desserts to the point that was annoying. When we were done, the waitress said she was working with the manager to get something off our bill, and then it took another 10 minutes sitting there before we ever got the bill and nothing was comped. We were so over it by that point, that we just paid it and left. Next time we'll go to CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=220

But there are limited options at Old Orchard for sit down meals so we inevitably end up here once every couple of months.Although this is a family friendly restaurant they hardly know how to handle families with kids. A few hints: 1)  take order immediately, 2) when parent asks for the check as soon as meal is brought please honor that request and bring the bill, 3) then actually stop by and pick up the check that has had the credit card sticking out of it for the past 10 minutes. Added bonus-I always discover a sneaky charge on the bill that I am not in the mood to contest, This past week I was asked if I wanted milks with my children's meals, to which I replied, only if it comes with it, otherwise water is fine (bc my kids hardly drink milk with meals). Three milks came and I was charged 1.75 for two of those (my kids split one meal). I also requested a kids turkey sandwich (not on the menu) and was told no problem. The waitress brought a huge sandwich fit for a grown man, not a 27lb 3 year old and then was charged $9. Had the waitress told me that wasnt available but I could order the adult meal, I still would have done so, however I felt that was sneaky and was seriously annoyed.

I haven't been here in a while because somehow I forgot what happened the first time; I ordered spinach cheese dip and I thought they were trying to poison me... since the spinach tasted so old and spoiled. After the manager apologized, they brought a popcorn shrimp dish... nice try but that was gross as well. So after forgetting the disgust I felt years ago, I came back to try the cheesecake... I figured a place that had ""cheesecake"" in the name would have good cheesecake.  WRONG.  Not only did our waiter win the asshole of the month award by a long shot, but the cheesecake was enough to turn off even the more gluttonous stomach.  After waiting 15  minutes for the asshole waiter to get to our table, I told him we were ready to order and just having desserts... Which was my first mistake, because that's when his attitude started... God forbid anyone comes to the cheesecake factory wanting nothing more than cheesecake.  I asked him a normal question, ""Be honest, is your latte good"", his answer, ""It tastes like a latte""... thanks asshole I was imagining it tasted like orange juice. Then we waited another 15 minutes (apparently it's a whole ordeal to slice a piece of cake and throw some coffee in a cup)  Well I should have thrown the latte back in his face, because it tasted like hot garbage, which should be a crime since it cost more than it would at Starbucks.  Next came the cheesecake, which tasted like it sat around for a good week before we were served.  I think they should cut down their menu and focus on making good quality food, instead of offering an array of throw-up worthy, spoiled garbage.  They should also re-train their waiters.  This place is overpriced for the crap that it is, and I will never come back. You would have to pay me to eat there because my stomach felt like it was on fear factor.

Just the pineapple chicken was a let down, as it is just like orange chciken with few pineapple bits in there. The cocktail were great and since my sister's came in a chipped glass, the waiter happily got her another one. We were impressed by their option of low carb, no sugar cheesecake option!

And let me tel you, that must have been one of the best restaurant soups I have ever had in quite sometime. So FYI, don't pass up the soup if it's offered. You will not be disappointed.    Please forgive me on forgetting the names of the entrées. But I'm sure if you show the waitress or waiter the will know what it is.    My pasta with chicken was delicious. My wife's salad with fish was the same. We enjoyed them so much that we tried to hold back as much as possible so we would be able to take them home to have for the next day : )   So if you are reading this review to try and make a decision on where it is that you and a family member or friend would like to dine.

Cara M.,"Chicago, IL",53,57,83,3.0,5/31/2017,"I've really been messing up going to Cheesecake Factory recently. I'm blaming it on just ordering poor items off the menu.  I ordered the key lime cheesecake to come out first, so I wouldn't be full by the end of the meal and I could eat it throughout the meal (genius idea, in my opinion). I also ordered the goat cheese and beet salad along with the crispy crab wontons. Clearly, I wasn't feeling in a healthy mood this fine lunch and tried to make myself feel better by ordering a salad along with dessert and a fried appetizer lol.  The goat cheese and beet salad - delicious. The only thing I take points off is for their plating style. It's so, ""meh."" I feel like they could plate it a little nicer.  Then, the crispy crab bites come out. At first I thought it was my mistake ordering, but no, I remembered adding in the ""wonton"" part in my order request and pointing to the words as I said them. The waiter was apologetic and that's not why I gave 3 stars. He was really nice about it, gave the table the bites no charge and went to go put in the wonton order. Since I tried the bites, I personally did not think they were good. He compared them to an appetizer favorite, alongside avocado egg rolls. They tasted fish-y to me and fell apart too easily.  But, back to the wontons that finally came out. Ugh, I was so disappointed. I've gotten these before at another location and they were delicious! These, though, the filling was neon yellow and it tasted very mustard-y, so I'm assuming that's what the yellow is from. I was so sad. I wanted to love them again.  One thing I didn't like about the waiter was that he took forever to come back to our table between each time. Don't get me wrong - he was really nice. It just took a while that we had our credit cards waiting when the check came, so we wouldn't have to wait for him to come back around again. Okay, well that's my Cheesecake Factory rant. This will not stop me from coming back. I've gotten delicious items from this menu, I've just been off my culinary game, I guess, for the past couple of times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie

I got tired of Cheesecake here (sorry to say this), but I love to keep coming back for meals.  [LOVE]  + Super antioxidant salad (surprise you'll be very satisfied!)  + Thai lettuce wrap (not appetizer! It can be entree!!) + Pasta napoletana (good for left over lunch) + Grilled Salmon (not very special, but always good!) +BLT salad (please make your way baaaaackkk!!!!! Love you!!!) [Not Good] + Sweets including any cheesecake and tiramisu (I know it sounds ridiculous, but not for me. They are way to sweet and heavy. They need to work on more lighter sweets like soufflé, baked cheesecake, panna cotta, etc) + Espresso drinks & coffee (so sad) + Tacos (always cold... Why?) They have lots of varieties for meal choices. Americans, Mexicans, Italians, and Asians! At my recent visit for lunch, I finally got ahi tuna! I mean seared tuna tataki salad. I've been asking for it more than one year at dinner time, but they always said out of tuna today. I liked tataki tuna itself, but I wish they mixed tomatoes and avocados together with greens. I feel like they are left a part.  I wish BLT SALAD will come back to menu. I felt in love with it at my very first visit at the Cheesecake Factory. It was so memorable, delicious, and of course so fresh! Very clean and moody atmosphere, but good for family too! Service is always good :) Good for date night and special celebrations, but I just come here maybe once in a month or two months for varieties of food!  *Suggestions Besides BLT Salas's coming back to menu and working on new lighter desserts, I wish Sunday brunch would be available on Saturday, too!

After I tasted it and then felt the dish, I just had one more spoonful and didn't touch it again.  Because it was a business meal, I didn't want to derail our conversation, so I didn't say anything.

The dessert was delayed with a lame excuse that they had to be completed (conflicting ""stories"" from wait staff and managers).  We were never greeted with even a hint of a smile. We seemed to be a major inconvenience to them.  We spent close to $500 and felt we were fools for doing so.  We discussed our unhappiness with 2 managers.  Wow, are they lame!  They must be on the defensive often because they both greeted us with huge attitudes and really didn't have any concern for our satisfaction at all!  The kicker is that they even fixed the tip after taxes.  No way were we going to spend 30% on a tip for service that we didn't receive!

Natasha R.,"Riverwoods, United States",159,211,686,4.0,11/9/2012,"Out of all the chain restaurants that are not LEYE, Cheesecake has to be my favorite one. Everything is always so delicious, either eating inside or carryout. This ends up being our default restaurant to order from when doing family dinners at home, though we order from the Lincolnshire location since it's closer. I recently dined here, and have to say that I like this location a whole lot more. Mainly two reasons why I like it more, since the quality and taste of the food is primarily the same. This location doesn't have the ""Lincolnshire vibe"" (I am sure some know what I am referring to when I say that) and I the interior is so beautiful and a lot more spacious. I haven't been to any other locations, so I am just judging between these two.  Food - LOVE both the dark and white bread that they give out, esp with butter. Mmm so good, but it fills you up before the real food is served! My favorite dish is the Chicken Madeira which is under their specialties. It's pricey, but it's a HUGE portion and the melted mozzarella cheese on the chicken is absolutely incredible. I've tried three or four of the salads, all are great! Basically, I've never experienced anything bad, nor has any of the people I've dined with. I try to stay away from the cheesecake, but I can admit to having tried it just a couple times and it's always unbelievably good and bad at the same time... can't even imagine how many calories are in once slice! The two I've tried are the red velvet and pumpkin - can't go wrong with those two flavors... EVER!

Natalie S.,"Des Plaines, United States",25,14,29,5.0,9/7/2014,"I really don't know where to start when it comes to the Cheesecake Factory. I tried it for the first time around 6 years ago and I couldn't believe what I had been missing. I am such a fan.  Important points: 1) This is a GREAT place for pasta lovers. Seriously, you don't know what you are missing. ~(The shining star dish is the Louisiana Pasta, which is divine. Crispy breaded chicken on top, bow-tie pasta with a spicy Cajun sauce and small bits of mushrooms and red peppers. They must put some type of drug in this dish because it is that addictive. Also, the Farfalle pasta is to die for. Bow-tie pasta in a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce with a medley of peas, caramelized onions, tomatoes, and tender chicken pieces. My boyfriend and I always have a deeply internal conflict with choosing one over the other, haha. We always end up getting one for him and the other for myself, and then sharing them both. They are both that good. The Evelyn's pasta is also delicious (penne with broccoli, dried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, Kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts.) My mom is obsessed with that one.)~ 2) The portions are ENORMOUS. I am a distance runner and have the appetite of a horse, and twice I have made it my goal to finish my entree, but have yet to make it happen. Maybe because I pig out on so much bread beforehand? Also, the pasta tastes just as amazing the next day! 3) Going off of the second point, the bread is AMAZING! You get both sour dough and pumpernickel. It is so fresh and soft that it just melts in your mouth. The bread is almost as exciting as the meal itself. Also, they bring you as much as you want. The only thing I always find irritating is how difficult the butter is to spread because they take it straight from a fridge, but no complaints.  4) I know that I probably do not need to emphasize this...but the cheesecake is heaven on earth. I love cheesecake and this is the place to get it. I have tried so many different flavors, but my favorite is definitely the red velvet. It is enormous and so rich and delicious. The Godiva cheesecake is so deep and rich, great for lovers of rich cocoa. The oreo cheesecake is great, Reese's peanut butter cheesecake is amazing and huge, dulce de leche is smooth and creamy, banana cheesecake is heavenly. Can you tell I have been here a few times? Haha.  5) The prices at this restaurant make it somewhere to go more for a special occasion. I go here for birthdays (which they have always made special by decorating a plate with strawberry sauce and adorning it with a massive slice of cheesecake 0:]), graduations, anniversaries, that type of thing. Definitely not your casual, Friday night type of budget. When my boyfriend and I go, we get two entrees and a dessert to share (and sometimes a soda), and it is always right around $50. So totally worth it.  6) The food is ALWAYS a hit, but it is true that the service can SOMETIMES be a miss. We have definitely had more good experiences than bad, but if you do get a slow server (won't bring out the bread right when you get there), just ask for it. It has never been a big deal. The staff has always been friendly to us, and never slow enough to be aggravating.  *I think it is important to warn that I do not recommend this restaurant for much besides the pasta. The prices just do not justify their other options, in my opinion. My brother felt like being a king, so he ordered the $25 steak, and was not impressed. I am not a steak lover, but do admit that thing was tiny for what he paid. He received a side of fries with it. Just not worth 25 dollars. Go to Longhorn for that. For pasta though, I insist, you will not find better pasta in bigger portions anywhere else. Best place ever. I have also heard rave reviews about their fried mac n cheese, but have never tried it myself. I love this place! Please give it a try on your special day! And don't leave without getting cheesecake! So worth every penny!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=160
Mikey J.,"San Francisco, United States",360,325,19,3.0,20/8/2011,"Came here with a crew after eating Hecky's turkey legs.  Yes, we were foolish enough to have cheesecake after devouring enormous sticks of meat. Now, I've been here before and have always had a decent time.  I have also had the cheesecake before and was satisfied, but remembered that the slices were incredibly rich and filling. There were four of us, and, recalling the size of the slices, I recommended splitting 2 or 3 pieces at most between the three of us.  But no.  I was vetoed down.  Damn democracy does not work when the parties are uninformed! So we each ended up getting a slice.  Four slices total.  First through fifth bites were excellent.  Then it started to go downhill from there.  Of course, as expected, we reached our limit and began to struggle, I mean really struggle, to finish our slices.  Delicious as they were, by the end we were filled with only feelings of shame and ""Holy shit my stomach is too full, please no more.""  It's like in a crowded train, where two hefty riders are trying to squeeze into those tiny seats next to each other.  The riders are too big, the seats too small.  There is no room.  Now replace the train with your stomach, and the riders with a turkey leg and big ass cheesecake slice. Now you may be scolding us in your head thinking, ""Well it's your fault for eating a turkey leg, then going all crazy and getting cheesecake on top of that.""  Well, you're right.  But it's not an unimaginable situation, as many people eat dinner at the Factory first, then go on to dessert. In economic terms, what happened to us is called diminishing marginal returns.  Layman speak: You'd pay a lot to eat that first bite of cheesecake and boy is it worth it.  By the second or third bite, the amazingness begins to subside.  Keep going and soon enough, you'd actually pay to NOT eat another slice. So be warned!  Damn good cheesecake.  But split that richness with a friend. Or two.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=160

I had planned a baby shower months in advance with the manager, Lynn who said I could pick anything from the menu (including appetizers) to be served as meals for a lunch party. I was told we will also get the lower floor since we had estimated about 40-60 guests. I live in Florida. My best friend went to go look at the lower floor, where the party would be, and met with another manager, Michael who said that we have to cater from their brunch menu and that Lynn gave me the incorrect information. (This is more expensive). A week before the party, I went to the restaurant and met with the catering manager,Molly,  and was told that Lynn and Mike should have directly told me to contact Molly because they had given me the wrong information again. Lynn said that I could just directly work with either her or Michael. I was willing to pay more money to host the party again. A few days before the party, Molly called me and said that the bottom floor flooded and they have to give me a room that will hold 40 guests when our confirmed list was 58 and she would squeeze chairs into the room and have more seating extended in the hallway. This would look so awkward and the guests wouldn't be together. Imagine how upset I was that I was accommodating to their lack of communication again such last minute. I asked Molly to compensate something for their lack of professionalism. She knew they messed up and offered me 2 free appetizer. The next day she called me again and said that her boss didn't approve the appetizers so she has to retract them. That's something she should have discussed with her manager before offering to me. I talked to the general Manager, who was so rude, condescending  and sarcastic.  In the end, I canceled the party and held it at a different venue on 1 day notice. I would never host a party there and would advise anyone never to host their special event there.  Their staff is so unprofessional, irresponsible, inexperienced, and do not have any manners.

Michael N.,"Wheeling, United States",37,53,7,1.0,3/10/2014,"I think what's most upsetting about writing this review is that the Cheescake Factory of the 90's in the Chicago area is not what it is today.  Today it's like an old tired restaurant that stopped trying.  I was at the Skokie location twice in the last few months and one time it would have been on about a 3 star level in terms of food and service and the most recent really took a plummet. Mimosa's ordered for the table.  On the weak side and the strawberries in there looked as if they sat around for a week or so.  But hey, alcohol is alcohol so let's not base a 1 star review off of that...just a small contributing factor. My order of fish and fries was not good.  I would have expressed it to the waiter had he come around at some point to check in, but he didn't come around until the end.  At that time I was irritated and more or less had a full plate.  The fish was tiny and tasted burnt.  If you ask most folks, I'm not one to complain about food.  I might say it's so-so, but I'll usually still eat it and possibly give a place another shot. When the waiter returned and asked if I wanted the dish wrapped I said ""No thanks, the fish was overdone and not really edible if you can pass that to the kitchen.""  He said ""ok"" and left.  When he returned we were handed a check for all 3 of our meals.  So let's pause here for a moment...if I'm in some random grab'n go place, then my expectations are not that high.  When I'm being asked to spend $80 for lunch for 3, the expectation goes up a bit. The waiter (which I have been several times) doesn't buy the food, cook it, clean the dishes or the floors.  The waiter delivers the food and makes sure that the front of house interaction goes smoothly for the customers along with possibly wrapping silverware or marrying the ketchup.  So I would expect that when I handed back a pretty much full plate and expressed a concern, that the waiter would take some action.  He chose none of that and ignored the problem.  I still left a tip...why I'm not exactly sure, but it was just a couple bucks and well below the industry standard.  I even regret the amount I left but I basically subtracted the cost of the dish from his tip and left that. I realized from the two trips to the Skokie Cheescake Factory what they lack.  Standards.  The waiters clearly don't seem to care and it's not just from this experience.  The time prior to this visit I was with a group all I personally ordered was coffee and had to ask twice for cream, clearly a very complex ingredient.  It's the standards and attention to even to a basic service which are virtually non-existent.  It's almost painfully clear on several of the waiters faces just how much they can't wait to get out of there that day.  The only thing that could top the experience you're destined to have here is if you go home, open a frozen box of fish sticks, throw them into the fireplace for a few minutes and then have a 4 year old overloaded with muscle relaxers serve it to you.  Because at least the standards of the 4 year old would be higher.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=120
Aunt T.,"Evanston, United States",2,21,,1.0,13/4/2016,"Bacon bits (alleged bacon bits) on the Cobb salad broke off a piece of my bridge. Not a weak or distressed tooth - a $3,000.00 bridge made of state of the art material able to withstand the pressure of an elephant standing on it (or so my dentist claims, lol). My companion had a pit of plastic wrap still adhered to his chicken (wtf?). We told the waitress about the plastic, and that something in the salad (bacon bits was the only ""hard"" item in it) broke my tooth; she just said, ""oh, would you like anything else?"". Uhm... no. No thanks. If their bacon bits (possibly mixed with parking lot gravel?) can chip a tooth, I'd rather not sample anything else from the menu that might cause bodily injury (carbolic acid soup? iced tea with ground glass in the crushed ice?). We didn't make a fuss - just got the check and said never again. NEVER again. Sorry - but I think this place is poorly run, probably has a filthy kitchen (what with broken teeth from salad and plastic stuck to the chicken not being of any surprise to the waitstaff), and their vast menu is nothing more than overpriced pre-made factory foods that anyone can microwave (ConAgra food service type stuff). There is no accountability at this place, and no real ""cooking"" being done.

Hyun R.,"Lincolnwood, United States",17,12,,3.0,17/2/2014,I like going to Cheesecake on a date night. It is a very big place. And their menu matches their size. Wish the menu was a bit smaller and concentrate on a smaller menu. The bread is good and no matter what you order on the menu you get what you pay for or even more. The portions are big and the flavors are good. Sometimes you might have to wait for 20-40 mins depending on date and time. Over all this is a good place for a date and to hangout.

Laura C.,"Houston, United States",99,357,306,2.0,12/11/2012,"I'm slightly embarrassed to admit I ate at The Cheesecake Factory, but a recent trip to Old Orchard with hungry friends had me acquiescing to this chain restaurant despite my pleas to go somewhere else.   At an off peak 2 PM time slot on a Saturday, we entered to find the first floor completely empty and all business directed to the second floor.  As we climbed the steps, the loud buzz of customers gradually grew louder, and I was shocked at how busy the joint was.  We were seated close to the kitchen pass, where I could see food runners and cooks playing with the food, throwing stuff back and forth, letting food drop to the floor and not picking it up, scraping dirty plates and not bothering to wipe their hands before grabbing the next dish going out to the customers.  It was not a pretty sight.  But it's unfortunately more common than not; I just wish I couldn't see it.  I also witnessed three salads dying in the window, that just sat there the entire time we ate.  I feel bad for the poor soul who had to eat the limp greens. Service was slow; our meals took a good 20 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  With servers and food runners abound, it seemed as if a more efficient modus operandus was in desperate need.  Side note, the uniforms were white pants, white shirts, and white shoes, and I felt a little bit like I was in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" with the orderlies swarming the place.  I felt rushed and uneasy with all the activity and the noise in the room.  Twice throughout my meal, I had food dropped on me, once from a busboy cleaning the table next to me, and once from our server, who took my friend's leftovers into the kitchen (under our assumption that he was going to box the food), and he returned with said leftovers, a take home box, and my dirty plate.  Why he didn't drop the dirty plate off before coming back or why he didn't box up the leftovers in the back, or why he didn't just leave her leftovers at the table and bring out a box made no sense.     Anyhoo, foodwise, I chose the crispy artichokes, a deep fried plate of hearts accompanied by a gelatinous aioli.  Together with a cold beer, it wasn't bad, but certainly not something I would return for any time soon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=240

This weekend I tried the garlic noodles with chicken. The chicken (additional) was basically fried chicken and I was so happy. The garlic sauce was lightish (compared to many of their cream-based sauces) and gave me such crazy delicious dragon breath that I couldn't help but fall in love.  With so many places to eat in this town, I really shouldn't end up here so much, BUT it seems to be a people pleaser (at least when out of towners come to visit) and I can always find something to enjoy here.  The selection of cheesecakes is bananas that I usually don't even end up getting any.

Annie Y.,"Los Angeles, United States",372,378,,4.0,8/5/2010,"I'm not embarrassed to admit I love the Cheesecake Factory. This one isn't my favourite location, but it's five minutes away from my house, so I always end up eating here with friends. The wait here is usually pretty long, though not as bad as the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove in Los Angeles that I also frequent. They almost always make up for it with good service once you're seated, though. They have a huge menu with a wide variety of dishes. I have go-to dishes for every category, depending on my mood: Appetizer - My favourites are the tex mex eggrolls and the thai chicken lettuce wraps. I wouldn't say the text mex eggrolls are worth the price, but they're SO good. And the thai chicken lettuce wraps come in an enormous plate -- definitely enough for a meal. Soup - Clam chowder! Their clam chowder is so chunky and creamy; I love it. Salad - BBQ chicken salad. Huge portions and really tasty, though there usually isn't that much chicken. I haven't tried any of the other salads, but they all sound really good. Pizza - BBQ chicken pizza. It's the only one I've ever tried, and I like it enough to stick with it. I wouldn't order the pizza here, though -- it's good, but there are better dishes on the menu. Seafood - Miso salmon. Honestly, you can't go wrong with this dish in any restaurant, but it's especially good here. My only qualm is that it's fairly expensive at $19.95. Pasta - Honestly, I've tried almost every pasta dish on their menu, and I don't really like any of them. They're all decent, but I can never finish more than half a dish. The Louisiana chicken pasta is probably my favourite, though the spicy chicken cajun pasta is also good if they don't make it too sweet as they tend to do. Specialties - The Cajun chicken littles are amazing when they're well done. Even if the chicken is dry or burnt, though, it's worth ordering the dish for the mashed potatoes alone. Mmm. The Shepherd's Pie (ground beef, carrots, peas, and onions topped with mashed potatoes) is my absolute favourite dish. If you make it here in time for lunch, order this -- it's only $9.95, and it's big enough that you'll bring home leftovers. Just ask them for minimal oil, otherwise it'll be swimming in grease. My most recent discovery is the shrimp and chicken gumbo. They're really generous with the meat, and the sauce is well seasoned. I find that it doesn't keep well in the fridge, though, so try not to bring home leftovers if you order that. As for the cheesecake part... well, surprisingly, I've only tried one of their cheesecakes (white chocolate raspberry) and I wasn't impressed. I always come into the restaurant and swear I'll order a slice of cheesecake, but I'm always too full after my meal to even look at the dessert menu. Next time I'll skip the meal and come here just for cheesecake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=260

Comes back 10 min later to realize he forgot our drinks. We get our drinks  we order a burger, chicken & biscuits, a side of eggs, & mac & cheese. Food took a lil longer than usual. The main focus of complaint was the food & service. My boyfriend's burger was great, fortunately he noticed the inedible peel & outer skins of the grilled onions atop before he bit in. We just asked for the onions to be removed. Biggest disappointment was the chicken & biscuits. The chicken was tough as tho it was frozen. We tell our waiter who really didn't offer a solution, my boyfriend just asked for better chicken. I wanted to send the whole meal back it lacked in flavor. I've had this meal before & it was wonderful. I should've got my usual, chicken Madeira. The manager comes to our table, advises their chicken isn't frozen his solution was ""so u want more chicken?, we won't cook it so much."" We end up just taking the rest of the food to go. They didn't comp anything, they charged us for everything. I realize our waiter & manager didn't even apologize. The worst part is when I got home. I open up the chicken & biscuits. I try the chicken first which was an improvement. But i realized they added the hard bottoms of the biscuits to my meal which were completely inedible. Our meal was $50, which is a lot considering I barely enjoyed my meal. We've spent triple that amount in other restaurants & left satisfied, with no complaints.

For the main I had the blue cheese Cobb Salad which came drenched in its bacon and ranch salad dressing.  After several bites I made mention of it to the bartender/server (i was sat at the upstairs bar), he just said something to the effect of ""hmmm"" and went about his busy business.  It was pretty borderline as to whether or not I send it back but I was starving and in a rush so went with it.   This was prob a 2 star experience but I've done CF before with better results....in sum, a-ok.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=260

I like food that's hearty, tasty, hot and satisfying, and for me, all those chicken dishes on the menu don't quite hit the spot like a juicy piece of steak or fish--both of which were cooked perfectly--tender, juicy and tasty, with lovely sauces and mashed potatoes just the way I like em - a mix of rustic & creamy texture. I started off making a pig of myself with a bowl of rich/dark mushroom soup (there was something of a witch's brew of tasty veg & seasonings in there that did it no harm at all--yum), and some warm/crispy french bread. We don't go here a lot (it's become more of an occasional treat than something like a routine), but it's one that I have continued to look forward to (clearly others feel the same way, judging by the 15-20 minute wait, but the minutes trip by quite nicely when you spend it looking through the menu and browsing the cheesecake counter). I think the point is that there are very few places locally that offer that kind of value, and also come with nice service, easy parking, a location near home, and a relatively short wait (15-minutes).  Risking a post-meal heart attack, we shared a big slab of lemon meringue cheesecake too (not the lightest choice in the huge cheesecake selection, but very satisfying!).

mildred v.,"Chicago, United States",106,89,1,4.0,20/1/2009,"Not usually one for commercial places.  I like to give/spend (I prefer the term 'donate') my hard earned money to local restaurants but my mom swears it's a holiday when I take her for lunch/dinner here. Me and her split get the lemon herb chicken (which is I swear almost a whole chicken but I think it's half).  So juicy yet a little sour but nonetheless delicious.  The carrots go really well with dish (and i'm not a fan of carrots).  And the mashed potatoes are (i think) the best i've had.  We then end the meal by splitting their chocolate mousse cheesecake which is lighter (since it's mousse) than the other choices but ummm is still rich and heavy since it retains the property of. . . .  a cheesecake. The pumpkin cheesecake is my favorite but I think it's seasonal.   The service has always been good, my mom walks with a cane and they have no problem seating us close to the elevator or calling mall security for a wheelchair for our post-meal shopping fix.     Besides what I usually get, nothing else has impressed me.

Ryan G.,"Arlington Heights, United States",9,18,52,2.0,20/6/2009,"I will start with  few facts about the Cheesecake factory (this location) 1 . Importantly, the manager is not caring for customers.  The waitstaff seems to know this, and has become apathetic towards customer service, knowing nothing will be done to resolve an issue if a customer complains. 2. The menu is too large for the price of the food.  (true of any Cheesecake Factory)  It is abundantly clear that the kitchen cannot keep enough fresh ingredients on hand to make 1-2 day's portions of every menu item X times - and then sell each item for a reasonable price.  What I'm saying is: they use a lot of frozen food to maintain the size of their menu.  Especially at this location, quality suffers terribly.  Their menu is the size of the Space Shuttle crawler transporter.   3. The kitchen here is not terribly concerned with the accuracy of orders.  This is an issue particularly because of point #1. 4. Fries are NEVER good, always dry, as though they were fried hours ago and left under a heat lamp. 5. This location is getting progressively getting worse, not better.   That said, the building is nice.  I used to be a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and other locations may well still be acceptable.  Just be warned, the food is never GREAT, and you will very often have to wait for a table.  (Huge portions + mid-range prices + America = very very busy, all the time)  Truthfully, I would give more stars, but this location needs a few lowball reviews to bring the average down.  A-ok? Really? My god.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=260
DR. S.,"Chicago, United States",6,30,2,1.0,14/3/2011,"This one star is particularly for the employee (Hispanic 5'4"" male with mustache) who didn't even try to help me in front of the building after I exited the restaurant(@10.15pm) through the side door as he was coming out from the building with 2 big bags (food containers inside) and holding a big clear plastic cup of smoothie. Since the restaurant front door was locked after 10 o'clock on Sunday, and we (my wife, 10 months old son, and I) just realized that we left something on the table, so I was trying to go back in to see if it was still there; however, as he walked out through the side door, he immediately told me that the restaurant is closed which I said to him ""i just walked out the building, and I left something on the table. Please let me go up and see if it was still there"" (the restaurant was still half full when we left). He apparently didn't not even try to help me and said ""you can't go back in there, the restaurant is closed"".  1st, the restaurant should never lock the front door without anyone attend at the front desk which in my case, I can't go back in just to check on the table. Can you imagine if someone left their car key?  2nd, he didn't try in anyway to help the customer who actually spend money in the establishment to keep your operation running. He didn't realize that his partial salary is from what I spent at the restaurant. Regardless how busy your establishment right now, you definitely lose around $250.00 business a month as of today Mar 13, 2011. We spent $101.00 today with tips and $135.00 2 weeks ago. That's $3000.00 business in a year. The situation would had been different if he tried to call his manager for me or someone to come help me. We have been trying a lot of restaurants(Renga Tai, Maggiano, outback, California Pizza, and Jolane's) as we like to eat out every Sunday.It's very hard to find the restaurant that you like, and I think for the restaurant is also very hard to find someone who would spend $100.00 a dinner with the economy we have right now.     In conclusion, my wife and I haven't been back to Cheese cake Factory for more than 8 years, and the foods were not as good as current. We just go back since 1 month ago because one of my friend recommended the ""Luna salad"", so we go tried and we loved it. As well as the miso salmon, lettuce wrap, and fettucini chicken. We felt sad because we just started love to go there once every other week, and this was how we were treated.

Michael H.,"Evanston, United States",0,7,,3.0,15/7/2008,"I've been to this place quite a lot since it's right inside the Old Orchard shopping mall. There is always a line during the weekend. But popularity doesn't mean excellence here. Everything at this place is okay, and they stops right there. The food is alright for an empty stomach, but it leaves you no impression afterward. Of course, they're well known for their cheesecake, and the selections are good enough. I would rather stop here for an afternoon cheesecake and ice-cream treat rather than for a full meal. The service is less than average, even though it's not too bad. You will have to wait for quite a bit to be served and the servers tend to forget special requests. For example, I often ask for no onion, less fat etc.., but they forgot half of the time. Sometimes they are nice enough to replace it, sometimes they just apologize and hope that you're ok with it.

When we first sat down he didn't even give us bread, not till we ordered, my friend then ask if we could have bread and he just took it from another empty table and gave it to us and quickly left to put in our orders, so we had to ask another waiter for the butter. We got our food and ate, he ask us if we wanted dessert and we ask him which cheesecake is supposedly the best, his respond ""there all pretty good, just try one."" last time i ask a waiter which is the supposedly the best one he pointed to me the Godiva cheesecake (super chocolaty but great), this waiter didnt care what we order as long as we order something, he seem kind of in a rush also. over all its an a-okay place. sometimes its nice and sometimes its not. ehhhh.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=320

Unfortunately, I was really surprised and unhappy with how salty the dish was. I couldn't decide whether I just misremembered how the sauce was supposed to taste, or they had oversalted my dish.

I dished out $13 for a bowl of chicken chili, and my food buddy paid almost $20 for a serving of fish and chips. Now don't get me wrong, I'm willing to dish out money for GOOD food. $60 for a hearty meal at Avec? Sure. $250 per person at Alinea? Glad to. But for what you get, definitely not worth the price. 3. Service is good and attentive. Sometimes a bit hard to flag down your waiter/waitress, but nothing to really complain about. 4.

The chicken Madeira is 17.50 far to expensive for any chicken dish in a chain restaurant.  They got rid of the polenta fries which was one of our favorites.  We instead got the stuffed mushrooms which had no flavor.  The mashed potatoes were poorly made there were massive chunks of potatoes in there like they were hardly mashed.

All of us were able to find something to please our pallets and made sure to save room for the cheesecake dessert. The variety was nice since one of the girls was on a diet and was able to find something, another girl had dietary restrictions that the restaurant was able to accommodate and I just couldn't decide between three items.

Everything else went fine for the most part till the end. We sat and waited again just to get dessert, I had to get up and walk to the front to get my own menu.

There must be an elevator, but I didn't  notice one. Four of us came for dinner and we were seated in a room that would accommodate about 30-people. We had two female servers. They were polite, but a bit overly attentive and uncoordinated. The menu is a large, comb bound, full-color thing peppered with advertisements for other stores in the shopping center. Seemed a bit tacky to me even though I was eating in a mall restaurant. I ordered Chicken Bellagio ($14.95), which included two pieces of pounded and battered chicken covered in prosciutto and arugula. This was served on a bed of basil pesto spaghetti (smothered in olive oil). The food was delicious and served on a very hot plate.

J C.,"New York, United States",7,32,3,1.0,11/6/2012,"So, my friends are obsessed with this place. I have no idea why. It's weird because we usually dine at pretty upscale restaurants, and The CF is pretty much an amalgamation of all that we despise when it comes to dining. It really is a ""factory,"" serving mass-produced, bastardized versions of various cuisines and poorly executed American dishes. And yet, it tries to sell itself as some kind of ""fine dining"" experience, which really is quite delusional on their part. I went here for the first time in 10 years last week, and I was bluntly reminded as to why I had stayed away from this place for so long. First off, it took 20 minutes before a waiter even noticed us. Mind you, this was at 2 p.m. when the restaurant was two-thirds empty. When our server finally took our orders and got us water, she asked us if we wanted any bread. Um, we've been sitting here for over a half hour, and you ASK us if we wanted FREE bread? What did you think we were going to say? Too bad the bread was so dry I almost wish I had said ""No"" when she asked. I ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta lunch plate, which was described as what would be a ""normal portion at another restaurant."" It was huge, and I really wish it weren't. The chicken was dry, the sauce tasted like thousand island dressing and wasn't spicy enough, and the pasta was severely undercooked. Terrible food, questionable service, tacky decor.

Maria R.,"Streamwood, United States",173,77,441,4.0,4/4/2011,"Ahhhh Cheesecake Factory.....*sigh*  I love Cheesecake Factories as a whole, cheesecake notwithstanding. This particular location is built into the popular Westfield Old Orchard Shopping Center in Skokie, IL.  It's a bi-leveled restaurant that is nicely decorated in a art deco/egyptian style. I always like to bring my mom here for our mom-daughter lunch dates as they have a variety of dishes to choose from.  Oh, and when I say a VARIETY I mean a V-A-R-I-E-T-Y......ALL Cheesecake Factories....ALL of them have HUGE menus! It's like NOT a Cheesecake Factory if you don't have a huge menu. It's 20 appetizers that span like 2-3 pages of their menu, then they have the different sections which are about 1-2 pages each (ex: Pasta, Favorites, Salads/Soups, etc.). So, if you are bringing a large group, chances are, you'll find something for everyone at the Cheesecake Factory. As a whole, Cheesecake Factories (I've only been to the Old Orchard one and the Schaumburg one at least in Illinois.)  tend to be pretty consistent with their dishes.  Whomever they employ as chefs for their various restaurants, do not deviate from their standard.  This particular restaurant chain is based out of California and you can tell by a lot of its fairly healthy dishes.  They have dishes that aren't exactly healthy, but you know what I mean! :) The one thing I do not like about this Cheesecake Factory and not that I don't need it, is the stairs to the main dining area on the second floor.  Yes, yes, before you tell me, there IS a elevator at the back of the restaurant, but the intiial mode of transport to the upper level is the stairs.   Now, mind you, I am not the athletic type, far from it, but my mom had a time climbing those steps.  Whomever designed this was I guess going for aesthetically pleasing because the glass window that covers those stairs looks out onto the parking lot and DOES give this Cheesecake Factory a monolithic feel. BUT, I digress....it is minor. :) I just thought I'd mention it for this particular location. :)  Anyway, back to the food and service...the service is great.  Friendly and attentive staff.  We got seated pretty quickly during their lunch rush and our server was quick to take our order.  We got our yummy honey wheat and sourdough bread with butter right away. The one thing I love about Cheesecake Factories that even though they are a chain...they actually change their menus regularly.  They DO keep some of the more popular dishes, but they also add in some new and interesting ones. For an appetizer, we had the Crispy Artichoke Hearts, which my mom commented on enjoying quite a bit.   They came with a remolade, which gave it an added lemon taste to it.  I enjoyed the appetizer as it was tasty and the dip that came with it really added to it. My mom had the Tomato-Basil Pasta, while I kept it ""healthy"" with their Chinese Chicken Salad and their special soup of the day.  The soup was very delicious and the salad is as I remember it from having it many times before. (Consistency! WOO!) We skipped the cheesecake, but if you haven't had their cheesecake before....go get a piece!  My ABSOLUTE favorite is their Red Velvet Cheesecake as I am a total fan of red velvet cake, and pair it with cheesecake. O M G, you will like have a dessertgasm with this one!  My other favorites are the Banana Cheesecake and the sinfully dense, Reese Peanut Cup cheesecake. Heck, ANY cheesecake with chocolate and peanut butter will send you into an instant dessert-coma. :)  But...it's TOTALLY worth it!   Take it with you or eat it there....it's your choice! Overall, I like this location and afterward, you can walk around the mall to work off the cheesecake you just ate. ;)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=180

A friend of mine put it succinctly it's 'Chili's' for people with too much money. Their menu has a huge range but nothing in it is really any good. A lot of the stuff they have can easily be found elsewhere for cheaper-e.g. the popcorn shrimp which we got as a starter. Okay, but nothing spectacular.  Likewise the green chili burger I got was actually pretty underwhelming. The burger was tough, and the chiles were rather bland. I would have asked for hot sauce but our waiter was hard to find. He stopped by 3 times and the rest of the time I asked whoever dropped off our food for anything else.

HOWEVER, they made my night when upon my friend's inquiry - the manager told us that the beef gelatin in their cakes is halal gelatin which is something they started doing once they opened up locations in other countries such as Dubai because they wanted the people their to be able to eat their cakes, so yay!!! This is a pretty big deal for me because cake is one my top 3 favorite foods (along with cookies and mitthai) and I try my best to eat only halal food.

It is a really nice space here, pretty classy. The pleasantries end there, I sat and waited for over 10 minutes for a server , we were just about to leave when she finally showed up. The older lady next to us had it alot worse , I'll get to her later. I ordered the salmon over spinach , and the Crab Wontons. The wife ordered the Fettichini chicken and the kid ordered the pepperoni pizza. Then we waited ... and waited ... and waited , 15 minutes in all for the appetizers.  The poor lady next to us was sitting there when we were seated , and she was sitting there with an empty place setting when we got our appetizers. She finally got her soup about 5 minutes into out wontons. We then proceeded to wait for our entrees , for 25 minutes after our wantons were long gone , 30 minutes in all. The poor woman next to us finally got her sandwich after sitting with an empty soup bowl for 20 minutes as well. The place was full , but not packed to the gills like the wait would lead us to believe. My wife said the chicken she got was ""alright"" but I could tell she was still really pissed at all the waiting. I actually really enjoyed everything I ate , I gotta admit. While we ate , the woman time forgot finally got her food , and finished it. She called for the manager and the manager calmly explained that they ""were just really busy"" and offered to give her a certificate for a free appetizer ... what a dick. I finished my food and proceeded to wait for the check for another 10 minutes. I contemplated getting dessert , but by the time the server finally got there I was sick of being there. The prices were really high for what we got , I've payed much less for better.  I usually judge restaurants 80% to 90% on the food , putting much less value on service , ambiance and cost.

Charge was for $70.00. On the way out I asked the manager to give us the detailed bill. Waiter charged us everything from regular menu. I explained to him that we ordered everything from skinnylicous menu, we were holding those long menus while ordering. He said just because you are holding the certain menu does not mean that we ordered from it.I argued and he said he would make an adjustment to our bill, after repeating the same nonsense and looking at me like I was someone who was looking for something for free.

Lia O.,"Chicago, United States",0,22,,1.0,23/1/2016,"Ordered a cheesecake to go. Salesperson did not show me the cake (that's their policy). I got home, it had about a half inch of frost on it and was freezer burnt. Disgusting, never again. When I called to complain, the manager was not very helpful, seemed annoyed, she could offer a gift certificate, as if I would go back, or to replace it if I drove 40 minutes back to the restaurant. After some back and forth, she became more agreeable and apologetic and took my number, but not my name or card info to call me back to process the refund. She left a voicemail a half hour later saying a refund had been processed. Several days later, the transaction had not come off my card and was no longer pending. When I called the restaurant, another manager insisted it had been refunded and it would drop off. I explained that it was not pending anymore and that I work in financial services and understand authorization holds - this was not an authorization hold. He insisted it had been refunded, and read me the last 4 of the card refunded - not my card - they asked me repeatedly if I had used a different card. I had not. Turns out, goofball manager #1 had pulled up a receipt for the type of cheesecake I had ordered and refunded it, without confirming any info. Good job. Goofball manager #2 laughed about the fact that someone else got a freebie and promised to look into it. On the next call he was able to find my receipt and process a refund. Did I say never again?

Laura P.,"Des Plaines, United States",0,12,3,2.0,27/7/2013,"This is a depressing review to write, because both my boyfriend and I love the food here, but we keep having weird things happen here and it's going to be a long time before I want to come back. Our first weird experience was having the fire alarm go off right after we had our dinner served. Granted, not their fault, but a sucky experience trying to pay for our food quickly and taking home fried fish and chips. Shortly after that, I had a nice chunk of plastic in my pulled pork sandwich. At least they comped it. Tonight we had a little booth next to the wall outside the kitchen. Shortly after we got our drinks, we noticed a little fruit fly darting around our table. A few minutes later, we noticed that there were about 8 of them on the wall right above our heads. Gross. It looked like there was something sticky on the wall. We probably should have just left, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and we had already ordered our dinner and were really looking forward to dinner there. We moved to a booth on the other side of the aisle and were served our dinner. When we were about halfway done, someone went over to the original booth and started wiping down the wall - well guess what happens when you disturb the fruit flies? They fly around to other areas! The manager came over to offer us free desserts, but first, I don't eat dessert and second, I was done at that point. The manager came over literally 3 times to try to make us take the free desserts to the point that was annoying. When we were done, the waitress said she was working with the manager to get something off our bill, and then it took another 10 minutes sitting there before we ever got the bill and nothing was comped. We were so over it by that point, that we just paid it and left. Next time we'll go to CPK.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=220

Natalie B.,"Wilmette, United States",28,247,,2.0,16/11/2012,"This restaurant frustrates me every single time. But there are limited options at Old Orchard for sit down meals so we inevitably end up here once every couple of months.Although this is a family friendly restaurant they hardly know how to handle families with kids. A few hints: 1)  take order immediately, 2) when parent asks for the check as soon as meal is brought please honor that request and bring the bill, 3) then actually stop by and pick up the check that has had the credit card sticking out of it for the past 10 minutes. Added bonus-I always discover a sneaky charge on the bill that I am not in the mood to contest, This past week I was asked if I wanted milks with my children's meals, to which I replied, only if it comes with it, otherwise water is fine (bc my kids hardly drink milk with meals). Three milks came and I was charged 1.75 for two of those (my kids split one meal). I also requested a kids turkey sandwich (not on the menu) and was told no problem. The waitress brought a huge sandwich fit for a grown man, not a 27lb 3 year old and then was charged $9. Had the waitress told me that wasnt available but I could order the adult meal, I still would have done so, however I felt that was sneaky and was seriously annoyed.

S P.,"Chicago, United States",1,48,1,1.0,31/7/2012,"If I wanted to pay to be sick I would eat insects in the jungles of Costa Rica...  I haven't been here in a while because somehow I forgot what happened the first time; I ordered spinach cheese dip and I thought they were trying to poison me... since the spinach tasted so old and spoiled. After the manager apologized, they brought a popcorn shrimp dish... nice try but that was gross as well. So after forgetting the disgust I felt years ago, I came back to try the cheesecake... I figured a place that had ""cheesecake"" in the name would have good cheesecake.  WRONG.  Not only did our waiter win the asshole of the month award by a long shot, but the cheesecake was enough to turn off even the more gluttonous stomach.  After waiting 15  minutes for the asshole waiter to get to our table, I told him we were ready to order and just having desserts... Which was my first mistake, because that's when his attitude started... God forbid anyone comes to the cheesecake factory wanting nothing more than cheesecake.  I asked him a normal question, ""Be honest, is your latte good"", his answer, ""It tastes like a latte""... thanks asshole I was imagining it tasted like orange juice. Then we waited another 15 minutes (apparently it's a whole ordeal to slice a piece of cake and throw some coffee in a cup)  Well I should have thrown the latte back in his face, because it tasted like hot garbage, which should be a crime since it cost more than it would at Starbucks.  Next came the cheesecake, which tasted like it sat around for a good week before we were served.  I think they should cut down their menu and focus on making good quality food, instead of offering an array of throw-up worthy, spoiled garbage.  They should also re-train their waiters.  This place is overpriced for the crap that it is, and I will never come back. You would have to pay me to eat there because my stomach felt like it was on fear factor.

I ordered a Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad for myself, and again the server suggested it is too big for lunch and would I maybe like something on the lite menu? Then, at the end of the meal, he brought us our check without asking if we wanted cheesecake and said we probably wouldn't want dessert because (again) it was lunch time, and we probably wouldn't want any. I informed him that yes, we did indeed want cheesecake (to take home) and had the check redone.  His behavior was borderline offensive and definitely annoying.

I'm usually somewhat skeptical about large chain restaurants with ridiculously long menus, but every time I come to Cheesecake Factory and try something new it's always on point.  I started out looking through the cocktail portion of the menu. Everything sounded really good, but I went with the pineapple Moscow mule. It came with stoli vodka, pineapple juice, lime juice, topped off with ginger beer, and a fresh piece of pineapple as a garnish. It was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  I got the spin dip as an app (my go to appetizer). It came out hot with fresh tortilla chips, a side of sour cream, and a side of salsa. Also very delicious. The portion size was pretty big though so be careful when ordering apps here if you want a actual entrée bc it's going to be a lot of food.  I got an appetizer as my entree bc I wanted to save room for dessert. I got the corn masa tamale cakes and they are to die for. They are also a really good gluten free option.  I obviously ended the meal w a piece of cheesecake. They have a whole two pages on the menu and the only problem I had was choosing which one to get bc they all sounded amazing. I settled w the lemon meringue cheesecake, and it was another home run. It was not too heavy (which is my usual complaint about cheesecake) and was amazing.  Cheesecake Factory is a little pricey but totally worth it. The food, desserts, and drinks are amazing.

Ha B.,"Skokie, United States",0,7,,1.0,18/3/2017,"Honestly the food has always been good here..this must be my 3rd time here just this year. So we all order our food and the food comes. While eating my food i saw my father in law shaking his head and giving his chicken plate to my wife and mother in law telling them it's too salty and does not taste good. This is where it all began..  I nicely asked one the waitress if they could make his food again for its very salty.. she said absolutely and she also mentioned to put the sauce on the side just in case.. very very nice.. and so she went on to find our waiter.. This guy came to our table and was the most unprofessional the most arrogant and waiter I have EVER dealt with.. the gentleman had a man bun and unfortunately I forgot to take down his name.  Standing on top of us he says.. ""Excuse me sir but this dish looks like it's been half way done! If you think it's too salty you should've noticed it from the beginning? But let me see what I can do""  WHAT???!!! ... If im not enjoying my food you are going to stand there and tell me that I should've told you before!?????????  My father in law gave it a chance and if it wasn't for me he would've just left his food there! The guy takes our plate and goes in the back! After 5 mins he comes back and says  ""Would you like a soup or salad while you wait?"" ""Actually maybe the soup is too salty for you too just stick with a salad!"" WHHHaAAaaT?????!!!! You gotta be kidding me!!  He was rude.. unprofessional.. and acted like he was gonna pay for our dinner!  Cheesecake.. please hire people who don't hate their jobs and can put a good image for the Resturant!  You lost about 6 customers last night. Because I'm taking my business somewhere that I can enjoy the food.. and if the chefs make a mistake and the food is too salty .. they won't talk down on me to fix it!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=100

The girl scoffed and proceeded to package the four pieces laying down ON TOP OF EACH OTHER IN A SINGLE BOX AND SQUISH THE LID CLOSED, DESTROYING THE CAKE.

Allison H.,"Madison, United States",3,5,,1.0,22/4/2015,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory with my boyfriend expecting an experience a little nicer than a regular chain restaurant (e.g., Applebee's). Should have just gone to said chain restaurant. After we were seated, it took roughly 10 minutes to be greeted. Our waitress (who I didn't realize was our waitress at the time) went to every single table around us to deliver food, take orders, etc. She even pushed our table a few inches to the side to get in to deliver a plate of food to the people next to us. All she had to do is acknowledge us, say she was slammed, and we would have understood. Instead, she chose to ignore us and leave us waiting. Eventually she came to us and asked for our drink orders. We gave our whole order at that time, since we had ample time to decide.  She dropped off the bread first, drinks a while later. Then when we finally got the food, it was so lackluster. I had the Mexican salad with ""avocados, corn, chicken, sour cream, and hard tortillas."" It was made with shredded lettuce, which is okay on a taco, and tasted like coleslaw. The ""hard tortillas"" we're on the bottom of the whole salad, covered in a black bean & chicken mix, and they were ridiculously soggy. I ate the chicken and called it a day.  My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich, which was served with globs of coleslaw on it. He gets pulled pork sandwiches everywhere we go and I have never seen him so disappointed. I was going to ask the waitress for a different entree because I was so disappointed and starving, but she never came back except to drop off the check.  Terrible service. Sub-par food.

Prices are good for the portions you receive, and the drinks are delicious, never watered down. Get the Thai Lettuce Wraps --they're in the appetizer section --but it's a massive plate of luscious vegetable-laden wonder with three dips, all of which entice. They plate it on large leaves of red cabbage ...which I always squirrel away in a napkin to take home, and add to my smoothies and slaw the next day. Why waste a hunk of gorgeous nutrition?  This trip I had the Shepherd's Pie for the first time which is sort of deconstructed in a pasta bowl.

So I've been there many times and tried many dishes to have go to items that I'll order and not look through the menu.  If you're in the mood for appetizers then you can never go wrong with the Thai Lettuce Chicken Wraps.  They're just so fun! I also do love their brown bread they give you at the jump and fill up on that :/ Main courses, if you want a salad I always order the Luau Salad.  It's so different than any salad I've ever had.  It comes layered on these giant wontons that you crush up to mix together.  The green beans are so crispy and fresh and the mango gives it that nice sweet kick to it.  If you like sandwiches, the Shrimp Po' boy and pasta I get the Chicken Piccata with angel hair. The cheesecake... I'm not a big cheesecake fan so I usually get the Banana cheesecake. It's very light tasting, not too rich like some of the others.  I think I love the whipped cream the most, it's just perfect! Recently I saw a pic of their new cheesecake...The Toasted S'more!!

Grace H.,"Evanston, United States",65,102,56,4.0,2/4/2015,"Fancy, affordable, and delicious food!  I have to give this place four stars because it made my mom really happy. She was delighted by the fancy feel of the restaurant- the mood lighting, the soft rock playlist, the booths, and the sweet and kind waitresses.  A lot of people were waiting to be seated, but our wait was only 15 minutes.  The hostess quickly seated us, and the waitress came with ice-cold water. We asked for bread, and the bread was very soft and delicious. We wanted to ask for more, but we refrained because we wanted to save our appetites for the main course.  The menu is a whole booklet, and it also comes with a ""skinnylicious"" menu as well. My brother ordered salmon and rice dish (~20$), and he was impressed by the juiciness of the salmon and its tasteful marriage to the rice.  My mom ordered a turkey avocado burger from the ""skinnylicious"" menu, and I ordered a vegetarian burger from the skinny menu as well. Apparently, these dishes are under 600 calories! (Cheesecake has a bad rep for having extremely caloric food).  I appreciated this menu, because I hate fattening foods. Hate! Now I can still come to these nice restaurants with my family and friends :).  There was quite a lot of turkey on my mom's burger. The burger was more like a sandwich, because there was no patty. However, my mom thoroughly enjoyed the turkey (an inch think) and the avocado slices and the bacon slices.  I, on the other-hand, did not like my veggie burger. The patty was made mostly out of rice and beans. The texture of the rice did not complement the softness of the bread. I took the bun off in the end.. The patty was disappointing. I think morning star offers better patties.  However, the cheesecake is soo goood. We were full by the time we grabbed our dessert forks, but the decadence and richness of the cheesecake made us forget about our bloated tummies for a minute.  -It's a good place to go when you want to treat yourself. But be kind to your body please. Some of these dishes are more than 1000 calories!   -share the cheesecake, please! for your health!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=100

I suspect I may have gotten food poisoning from the fish tacos here last week*.  Whether that dish was the source of my 2 days of living hell won't be confirmed, but what I CAN say is that I was not impressed at the length of time it took for our food to arrive.  Thank goodness for wonderful company.  Once our dinners were placed in front of us, you could tell the plates had been heated under a lamp, as they were hot, but the food was lukewarm at best.  The tacos looked as if they had been prepared 2.7 days ago.

We were celebrating our family member's birthday and Cheesecake happens to be her fav restaurant. So when we asked where she like to go...we knew her choice. For a change the experience this time was very welcoming and warm. Our waiter was charming, informative and helpful and that changed everything. The food tasted more delicious and the place more familiar.  The Filet Mignon simply melted in mouth.My sister's Jambalaya and my husbands steak with teriyaki were outstanding too. Just the pineapple chicken was a let down, as it is just like orange chciken with few pineapple bits in there. The cocktail were great and since my sister's came in a chipped glass, the waiter happily got her another one. We were impressed by their option of low carb, no sugar cheesecake option! We have a suggestion to make, hopefully someone insider is listening. My son and i know many kids are allergic to eggs.

I visit here & other Cheesecake Factory locations when I can. Just because I know that I will always be satisfied with the service as well for the meals.    On this particular visit. I found myself venturing in to new taste. Such as the soup. I usually choose to have a salad before the main course. But this time I did the opposite, and went for their soup. And let me tel you, that must have been one of the best restaurant soups I have ever had in quite sometime. So FYI, don't pass up the soup if it's offered. You will not be disappointed.    Please forgive me on forgetting the names of the entrées. But I'm sure if you show the waitress or waiter the will know what it is.    My pasta with chicken was delicious. My wife's salad with fish was the same. We enjoyed them so much that we tried to hold back as much as possible so we would be able to take them home to have for the next day : )   So if you are reading this review to try and make a decision on where it is that you and a family member or friend would like to dine. Do not over look this place. The variety of different options they offer is great. And on top of that, let's not forget about the cheesecake.

The prices for the food are high but the dishes are pretty big and probably too much to finish in one sitting. Honestly my favorite things from here are a couple of the pasta dishes, especially the garlic noodles or the shrimp with angel hair pasta, and the chicken Madeira. The gumbo is also pretty good.

Cara M.,"Chicago, United States",53,57,83,3.0,31/5/2017,"I've really been messing up going to Cheesecake Factory recently. I'm blaming it on just ordering poor items off the menu.  I ordered the key lime cheesecake to come out first, so I wouldn't be full by the end of the meal and I could eat it throughout the meal (genius idea, in my opinion). I also ordered the goat cheese and beet salad along with the crispy crab wontons. Clearly, I wasn't feeling in a healthy mood this fine lunch and tried to make myself feel better by ordering a salad along with dessert and a fried appetizer lol.  The goat cheese and beet salad - delicious. The only thing I take points off is for their plating style. It's so, ""meh."" I feel like they could plate it a little nicer.  Then, the crispy crab bites come out. At first I thought it was my mistake ordering, but no, I remembered adding in the ""wonton"" part in my order request and pointing to the words as I said them. The waiter was apologetic and that's not why I gave 3 stars. He was really nice about it, gave the table the bites no charge and went to go put in the wonton order. Since I tried the bites, I personally did not think they were good. He compared them to an appetizer favorite, alongside avocado egg rolls. They tasted fish-y to me and fell apart too easily.  But, back to the wontons that finally came out. Ugh, I was so disappointed. I've gotten these before at another location and they were delicious! These, though, the filling was neon yellow and it tasted very mustard-y, so I'm assuming that's what the yellow is from. I was so sad. I wanted to love them again.  One thing I didn't like about the waiter was that he took forever to come back to our table between each time. Don't get me wrong - he was really nice. It just took a while that we had our credit cards waiting when the check came, so we wouldn't have to wait for him to come back around again. Okay, well that's my Cheesecake Factory rant. This will not stop me from coming back.

I've been asking for it more than one year at dinner time, but they always said out of tuna today. I liked tataki tuna itself, but I wish they mixed tomatoes and avocados together with greens. I feel like they are left a part.  I wish BLT SALAD will come back to menu. I felt in love with it at my very first visit at the Cheesecake Factory.

For lunch I ordered a burger, medium rare and my friend ordered their Asian salad (I forget the exact name).   They came out pretty quickly. My burger was a bit more medium to medium well, but still juicy. It was a good amount of food.  My real complaint is that I ordered a side of cole slaw, which tasted great. It was served in a dish that must have just been taken out of a dish washer. It wasn't warm. It was hot to the touch. I was worried that the cole slaw wouldn't do well. After I tasted it and then felt the dish, I just had one more spoonful and didn't touch it again.  Because it was a business meal, I didn't want to derail our conversation, so I didn't say anything.  My friends salad was huge and he really enjoyed it. I think they did a decent job. I'd be careful about how they serve the cole slaw.

Everyone that works there are either in their high school jobs or significantly older. There's hardly an in between. I come here mostly of their lemonade and the bread. They shiest the F out of you never filling up the 5.00 lemonade to the top so that's pretty shitty and you already know it's not free refills. Food is decent nothing special.

Melissa M.,"Wilmette, United States",1,34,,2.0,31/10/2014,"I have become very disappointed with Cheesecake Factory. My family and I have always enjoyed the food. We often pick up (at least twice a month) our dinner using the curbside service.  We did this last night and Cheesecake Factory messed up our order again for the 7th time in the row (in the past months). For spending over $50 for just 2 pasta dishes and 1 salad last night, one would expect better attention to details. We asked for extra sauce for one our our pasta dishes and the complimentary bread that comes with orders. Not only did they not pack the extra sauce but there was little sauce on the pasta to begin with. Also, they did not pack the bread. The last time we ordered something for pick up, they messed up 2 of the 4 orders. I had to drive all the way back from home just to get the correct orders. They were professional enough to apologize for this and offered complimentary dessert (which I turned down as we just wanted to eat our dinner....as that was delayed having to wait for our correct orders). I complained to the Manager about this (again) last night and he did listen and offered to personally pack my next pick up order himself. However, it is my opinion that a customer should not have to go to this level. The Manager of a good establishment should not have to personally get involved and the better focus is to get the crew focused on details. Beware....If you order for pick up or curbside, you better double and triple check your orders.

When I told my waitress, Victoria about the food, she acted apathetic as she walked away to call the manager. Minutes later, the manager came over to our table and we explained about the soup and salad and he was very unapologetic. All he said was, ""What do you want instead?""

She asked what dish it was, and kind of implied that it must be something that takes a long time. It was a sandwich. A sandwich... The rest of us had ordered hot dinner entrees and while we were eating, my friend had to wait 15 minutes to be served a cold sandwich.

The menus are filled with advertisements.  I'm not sure who started this trend, but for me putting commercials in your menu is a big red flag that says, ""we're a piece of crap, we don't care how the food tastes, we just want to fatten you up, sell you fancy watches, and later, eat you.  Also, we're aliens."" How tacky is that?  And why do we flock to places like this in droves instead of slapping them on the wrist for pulling such a bogus and unfriendly move?  Could you even fathom pushing advertising to people that come to eat in your house? Eating at The Cheesecake Factory is like accepting a dinner invite from your local Avon lady. Aside from the 20 pages of advertisements, their menu contains about ten thousand dishes.  It's as if they stole a bunch of menus from a bunch of crappy poophouses, took them to Kinko's, and hung out by the velo-binding machine.  Yet somehow, each and every one of these dishes tastes exactly the same.  Like fat.  And butter.  And garlic. The one nice thing about The Cheesecake Factory is the brown bread they serve you when you sit down.  It's decent bread.  They did not mess that up.  But the brown bread is hardly worth the other indignities you'll be forced to endure by stepping foot in this crummy restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=280

Robert S.,"Chicago, United States",161,1120,1197,3.0,17/3/2012,"They could slap a TGI Friday's sign on the front, and I'd never know the difference. If you're a country mouse, Cheesecake Factory counts as fine dining.  If you're a city mouse, the only reason you'll eat here is because you're probably desperate for something--ANYTHING--to be open late at Old Orchard Mall. Standard fried fare--typical 20 burger menu where they vary by a couple of ingredients.  Large salads, pizzas and a few halfway decent entrees for those of us of a certain age who have to worry about how much grease we want in our arteries. The schmaltzy bar downstairs is perfect for suburban cougars with their latest BoRics perm.  Upstairs, there's no place to escape the carnival-crazy paced atmosphere of servers running around desperately trying to keep up with the rapid table churn managers prefer.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=140
Douglas B.,"Chicago, United States",91,108,92,4.0,25/2/2014,"This place has always been a place that we go to when we have no idea what I want to eat.  There really isn't a whole lot of critique here... Its a cheesecake factory and they have great service.  I've never had a bad experience here.  Usually there is a big crowd, but I think the size of the place helps to accommodate the amount of patrons that show up. Once there my wife and I typically get an Iced tea or a vodka lemonade..  depend on how sassy I feel that day.  It's usually for lunch.   we always always have to start off with the Avocado egg rolls... why you may ask.. because they are some of the most delicious things ever created by the Avocado gods.  The sweet pesto like sauce they serve with it on the side just goes so well with them... they are always on point and consistent with them.  do it!! get them! Then the entree either consists of the April special chicken salad sandwich with side salad and a soup.. . you cant go wrong... a little bit of it all.  Delicious sandwich a tasty soup and a light salad.  It fulfills lots of needs.  If I show up uber hungers... then I go for the Cuban sandwich.  I know, its not totally traditional.. but their version of it is mucho nice!   They use this slow roasted pork that is phenomenal.  The bread is crusty and toasted and has delicious goodness in between.  It is super filling.   That's usually as far as I take my cheesecake adventure.  The place is great and has not disappointed yet.  Give it a go when you cant make up your mind!  Oh and if you ever decide to sit at the bar upstairs to have a drink or lunch.. ask for GiGi!!! shell make it a great lunch, shes super cool!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=140
Lauren D.,"Chicago, United States",165,372,,2.0,31/1/2015,"They had several choices that were slightly under 500 calories. Prior to going here I went on-line to look at their nutritional menu. I was shocked how much sodium is in nearly every dish. I mean well over 800, and some dishes have over 1,000 or over 1,500 mg of sodium. I ordered from their Skinny-licious section, where items are under 500 calories. I had the Skinnylicious grilled turkey burger, and scraped off all the condiments on the burger. I didn't eat the bun either. The grilled turkey burger was seasoned nicely. It was moist and tender and perfectly cook. However, the black pepper overpowered the burger. For this reason, 3-stars. BTW, my turkey burger came with a small side salad with a variety of greens (no tomato, no cucumbers, nothing else) Basically, a plain and boring salad that was very, very soggy. I didn't eat the salad. However, if you order their ""regular"" Turkey Burger you will inhale 1,370 calories and 1,630 mg of sodium (salt). Definitely not a healthy choice! On the other hand, my husband ordered a double burger which was huge and a mess to eat. It was topped off with four crispy onion rings, loaded with caramelized onions, bacon, cheese and bar-b-q sauce. He said he really liked his burger and rated it with 4-stars. His burger was 1,580 calories and contained 2,990 mg of sodium. Wow, a heart attack waiting to happen! His burger came with fries. He shared a few with me, which were very good. We ended up ordering an extra side of fries without salt. The fries were the highlight of my meal.  We also ordered chicken samosas as our appetizer. Four were served, and they were very, very small and bland. The exterior was crispy, light and flaky. These samosas were served with a dipping sauce. I tasted the creamy white dipping sauce sprinkled with some tiny green specks. It was incredibly bland, and another disappointment. I was expecting these samosas to be similar to the ones we have eaten at Indian restaurants. They were not.  Here is what I walked away with when I counted 166 items on the menu with over 1,000 calories (not a typo) that made me think it must be a very unhealthy restaurant to eat. Too many calories, too much fat, too much refined carbs, too much sodium (salt).  The restaurant was not crowded or super busy considering it was Saturday. We went up the stairs to the second level and were seated immediately near large glass windows. Service was painfully slow. Our water glasses were left empty twice, so we had to keep asking our server for water (otherwise, we never would have gotten a refill on our water glasses). My husband ordered an Apple Crisp to go. I don't eat sweets, so no dessert for me. He said it was ""good"" but nothing spectacular.  This restaurant reminded me of the Rain Forest Cafe, because it is like a gimmick. The interior was gaudy and ornate. We used up our Gift Card and left our Server a generous tip (even though he was awful). Yeah, we tipped him 25%, because we didn't want to come back here again and use up the rest of our Gift Card. Lucky him!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-skokie?start=140

Heck, CPK in Old Orchard is better than this place. It's always a zoo here and I don't think it's justified in any way realistically. The menu is overwhelming and nothing stands out. Always hated the ads in the menu too. The last two times I went, I have not been impressed with the food I ordered. I got the enchiladas, and they were not good. This weekend, I got the Farmhouse omelette. It has potatoes in it and and they serve potatoes on the side. Too much, and I love potatoes! And the omelette itself was rubbery, not egg like at all. With so many other options in the area, I can't imagine why anyone would pick this place. Large? Prices? Meh. Good for groups? Come on now.

Which is delicious :) Still, we were not asked if we wanted drinks or to order (appetizers, etc.) even with the bread delivery. When we were, Monica, our server, was very polite and apologetic- the place was packed and it was a little tough keeping up with it (perhaps having more wait staff is suggested). After we placed our drink and food orders, everything was delicious and ordered promptly.  My mom was visiting and it was her first time there.

We came at 6:00 on Friday, and we were immediately seated. In Schaumburg, the restaurant is smaller, and there is often wait times to get in. I believe the decor is classier, and feels much more upscale then the Schaumburg location housed within the mall. We were seated upstairs and had sole amount of space- not crammed into next to a ton of people. Our server was attentive and came by us multiple times to ask us how we were doing and if we needed anything. Since this is a chain, the food is pretty standardized... However the chicken Madeira that they boost about... It is truly phenomenal. The chicken is moist, and has very good flavor. My description wouldn't do it justice...It's something you just have to try for yourself.

The pasta was ok, it did not sit well in the end because a few of us went home with a stomach ache. One our burgers was served on a baguette and once again it was really tough bread to chew so the burger didn't get eaten.

The onion was in the middle of the sour cream until I moved it up top to see what it was. The crumbs were all through it!  Why would anyone use a spoon with grilled onions on it to scoop out sour cream, wouldn't you HAVE to see that beforehand? Because of the crumbs and where the onion was located, I am inclined to think this was used sour cream. How else would it get crumbs all throughout the container.

It was extremely crowded, but we still managed to get right in, and our server was right there ready to take our order.  Aiming for a light bite, and completely overwhelmed by the beyond ginormous menu, for some reason my eyes landed on the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. I figured it would be fairly small, so I added fries for $1 for all of us to share.  Holy chicken! The appetizer portion was a legitimate meal. Take note, the portions are huge here, and I had no idea what to expect. I also expected my chicken to be pretty basic, but can I just tell you? I enjoyed every bite, and it was so good I fought hard to finish it. The plate came out with sliders piled high and a huge portion of fries. It was really pretty hilarious.  The chicken was tender and lightly crispy with a nice buttermilk batter. The buns were toasted with butter (yep, pretty rich), and the fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned just right. I fully admit that I'm craving the chicken right now. I eat a lot of chicken, and I have to say this was a memorable meal...and I mean meal.
