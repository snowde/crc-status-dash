Jaffar Y.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,8,1,1.0,11/25/2017,"If I could give no stars I would. My wife and I have been going to this location for several years now and we have had a couple of 'somewhat' bad experiences but nothing compares to today 11/25/17. Everything was going so well. Waitor greeted us and took pie drink orders,  no big deal. We got our appetizers and he seven came to tell us that it was ready of we wanted it and we told him 5 min. Well, needless to say that it was definitely not 5 minutes later. Approximately 15 minutes later the first manger came to inform us that the food was old and that a new one was needing made, awesome right? Nope. When it came out 2 of the 3 dishes came out horrible.  My wife's Black Jamaican Chicken and Shrimp was room temperature, if that. The extra broccoli she asked for was still cold!! My Evelyn's Favorite Pasta was so hard and it was missing 2 of the ingredients that it is supposed to have, zuchini and eggplant. To top this crappy night off, it was my wife's birthday dinner and they didn't even remember to come and sing to her. The second manager tried to help a little by offering 1 cheesecake. Not to mention she didn't even try to offer anything else.  After some time our original waitor showed back up asking for more drinks!! So disappointed Cheesecake Factory..... very bad taste left after that one. Maybe stick to the bar area next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake
Joel K.,"Keller, TX",164,55,42,1.0,11/15/2017,"Frequented this location a few times now, but the most recent dine-in experience is finally prompting me to write a review after coming in for  a birthday dinner. The Cheesecake Factory has always had quite a large and extensive menu with pretty reasonable servings on all the menu items. Food is always fair/decent. Nothing mind blowing and usually not too bad.  Salmon: The salmon here is always well seasoned and cooked properly. Never had too much issue here. Lemon Garlic-Shrimp: This item was on the Skinnylicious portion of the menu so it's to be expected that they'd likely skimp on some of the higher caloric aspects of the dish. Shrimp was just okay and the flavor was a bit meh. However, it seems in an attempt to mitigate caloric counts on this item, they pretty much omitted nearly all the sauce from this dish. You get a bit of the lemon garlic sauce on the bottom of the dish, but the noodles itself were practically dry and without taste. Which prompted us to ask for a bit more sauce on the side. Fish & Chips: The fish was tasty, but had quite a bit of breading on it. Still good, but some may prefer a little more meat. The fries came out lukewarm and dry. It seemed it may have been overcooked or could've just been sitting under a warmer a bit too long. The coleslaw that came with this dish had good flavor, but was completely drenched in dressing. It was a lot less like coleslaw and a lot more like coleslaw soup.  Pumpkin Cheesecake: Seasonal cheesecake that was very good. Creamy pumpkiny cheesecake with a wonderful crust. Whipped cream was tasty and we had no issues finishing this item. The food overall was just fair. The big issue here that I've come to see is the service. Hostesses at the front are friendly and got us seated immediately for a Sunday night dinner. Which was great considering they weren't too busy. However, what aggravated the evening was our server. He seemed very disinterested in helping us. Here are some of the issues: 1.When the complimentary bread came, it arrived cold. (Now I know it's complimentary, but I expected some consistency). I noticed others around us received bread baskets with an assortment of the white, brown, etc. Our table however, received what was a single white piece, just enough for a bite when split between 4 people and it almost seemed like it was just a leftover piece taken from another table.  2. We had asked for the Salmon dish to be split for two. It was not split. We had to ask another server, not our original one for an extra plate where we did this ourselves. (Now I know this was a request, but it was completely ignored). Not a huge deal. 3. Our server never cared to checked to see if we were happy with our food or bother to refill our drinks. Never asked how we were doing during the 1 1/2 hours that we were there. Correction... I did get a refill on my tea, AT THE END of the meal after we had waited 20 minutes for our check. Seemed like a pointless refill after we had already gotten our bill. 4. When we asked for some extra sauce for the pasta dish that really lacked any sauce/flavor, the server dropped it off at the table without making any eye contact or speaking to us. Literally just dropped the sauce at the table and walked away. 5. It was a birthday dinner and the factory was nice enough to write happy birthday on the plate of the cheesecake we ordered. Cheesecake came by fairly late after we had already waited a good deal of time after completing our meals, but we weren't in any hurry. However, when the server dropped by, he put the dessert down, lit the candle, and walked away. Again, didn't look at us, no verbal communication, and walked away. Didn't bring any new utensils, so we also had to reuse our entrée forks/spoons for the cheesecake. Overall, it was a pretty horrible experience. It seemed like he was courteous enough with all the other patrons in the restaurant, but just didn't care for us at all. It seemed like he had issues with us as soon as we arrived and we have no idea why as we have never met or spoke with him before that evening. It was not a busy evening, not all tables were filled, yet we were willfully ignored by our server. He obviously saw us when we needed something while he was helping another table, but decided not to come over and help us. We always had to flag down another server mid meal to get him to stop by. I can't fathom what was going on, actually I can, but I won't say it here. I enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but this experience has soured my outlook on dining at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake
Tina B.,"Southlake, TX",355,8,33,5.0,12/29/2017,Our favorite family neighborhood restaurant- we can always count on good service and delicious food!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake
Ted A.,"Flower Mound, TX",1,143,58,3.0,5/29/2017,"As we had a gift card, we gave this place a try for not just the cheesecake. As expected on a Saturday late afternoon we waited...and waited. Upside was that we had time to check out the massive menu so that when we did get seated we were able to quickly order. We had herb crusted salmon and steak diane for entrees and finished it off with 30th Anniversary and Key Lime Cheesecake. The entrees: as expected, large portions for roughly $20 each.  Salmon defintely rated a take home box. Steak was surprisingly better than expected and it was finished off very quickly, great pairing with the mashed potatoes. Of course you get cheesecake, and we took home large portions of both 30th Anniversary and Key Lime. 30th was very rich, definitely a chocolate lovers fix. Key Lime was perfect mix of creamy tartness, not the overly sweet taste top often presented as key lime. Overall, hard to beat their cheesecakes and the entrees, though a bit pricey, we're surprisingly better than expected. Now it is a place that is more about volume in the number of people they push through the doors (thus the overly large menu) so service sometimes is hit or miss, we experienced both. Miss: dirty silverware set set out on a ""ready"" table Miss: bits of food left on the ""ready"" table Miss: ordering coffee and having it arrive at the table completely cold  Miss: waiting and waiting and waiting to get a the cold coffee replaced with hot coffee. You want the coffee and cheesecake to be enjoyed together not as separate courses Hit: time it took from food order to seeing the entrees placed on our table Bottom line, if you have gift card, definitely go, as long as you are a patient and forgive person. Otherwise,  there lots of other places you can choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake

Ashleigh C.,"Keller, TX",107,78,128,4.0,8/23/2017,"We came here because he wanted a veggie burger and I wanted fish... where else can you find both!!! Here! Cheesecake Factory is known for their vast menu and amazing options.  We are both watching what we eat so we ordered from the skinnylicious menu and ate for under 590 calories each. There is a major difference in calories from the skinnylicious menu. For example, the regular veggie burger plate had 1200+ calories but ordering it skinnylicious allowed for half of that!  The service was great! And here's a tip... if you decide to sit outside on the patio... you pass up the line. She didn't offer that but we asked.  Cody, our waiter, was busy out here on the patio but he did a great job management by the 5 tables including a 8 party table. We got our food fast and he was attentive and there when we needed him.

Darin S.,"Dallas, TX",16,100,31,4.0,7/23/2017,"Service.   Delightful Menu. Immense  Food. Uneven but good recovery  Wait time. Ideal Cheesecake. Devine My family and I wanted to grab a slightly late dinner on Wednesday evening.   We stopped by Brio and found that they were running a 30-45 minute wait still.    That was going to be late for us, and so we called Cheesecake, found that they were not on a wait, and walked across the street  I've been to Cheesecake twice in 20 years and so the visit was as if I was new.     The menu is huge and so if you have a picky opinionated family like I do, it certainly provides something for everyone.  I'm glad they put the calorie count on the menu.  Our waiter was excellent, polite, patient and accommodating.    The food portions are insane.   If your party can agree to an entree I would encourage sharing Menu items were hit or miss.  They were out of a few things.  Potstickers were a little black on the pan side.   Salads were nice. Thai lime curry special was not lime nor Thai.  It was more of a Indian curry with surprising levels of turmeric and nearly no discernible amount of lime, lemongrass or coconut milk.   Chicken Marsala was perfectly fine.   They had a great kids menu and my son devoured his hamburger.  My daughter simply couldn't eat the curry and the waiter offered to replace it with another item.   They did and it was prepared at light speed.  Great recovery Final thoughts.  CF while an established franchise, is worth a relook.  I've been to Brio enough to say that there isn't really a reason for such a disparity of wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake

Jessica T.,"Flower Mound, TX",89,84,37,1.0,9/13/2017,"Extremely disappointed with the service we received today. We came here as a last meal as husband and wife before our baby is born. We came for lunch around 1pm today.  Our server greeted us and took our drink order. Once drinks and bread were delivered, he disappeared for 10 minutes. By the time he returned, our drinks were already empty and so was our bread basket. I requested additional bread, and my husband also ordered the garlic cheese bread as an appetizer. The server asked if we wanted the appetizer before our meal, which we said we did. I could feel my blood sugar getting low and figured the garlic bread would at least come out quickly even if the free bread didn't.  Our server left to put our order in. 15 minutes later, someone comes by to offer me a refill on my drink that has been empty for over 25 minutes now, except he brought sweet, and I was drinking Unsweet. Our bread (garlic cheese bread and the complimentary bread) are still not out to our table 20 minutes minutes after we ordered. I am feeling physically ill at this point because my blood sugar is so low. I realize this is my fault for coming to a restaurant and expecting to actually get some food, but our server never even passed by our table, way in the back, for me to remind him that he had forgotten to bring us bread and drinks. Finally our entrees arrive ahead of our bread. The garlic bread comes minutes later with an apology that it took so long from the person running the food. Our server comes by when we are almost finished with our meal and says, ""Sorry your bread didn't come out when you asked. Is everything else ok?"" I had the Louisiana chicken pasta, my husband had the chicken Marsala. Both were well seasoned and tasty and came out warm.  We asked for the check. No comp was offered for the bread (still charged $10) and no apology for the terrible service.  We will not be returning here in the future. $60 for lunch for a meal with terrible service is completely unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake
Bethany V.,"Grapevine, TX",177,3,,1.0,12/16/2017,"The only reason I'm giving them a star is because the server was great, honestly I have gone back and fourth on writing this review but having two managers stare you down when you had only been there for 20 minutes (when you waited an hour to sit) and then sending a hostess to ask if we were ready to go when we were clearing eating is just rude.

Magnus L.,"Denton, TX",95,603,258,4.0,11/13/2016,"This is a good location of the Cheesecake Factory. I have always received good service here and the wait is typically not long either. We came here last time on a Friday night and we still didn't have to wait more than 20 mins. Their menu is pretty overwhelming unless you come here on a regular basis. One of my favorites is the hibachi steak which comes with Shiitake mushrooms and Wasabi mashed potatoes. It has really great flavor and I can't remember being served better mashed potatoes at any other restaurant. The grilled steak medallions from their Skinnylicous menu is also very good. If you can leave here without getting cheesecake, you have better character than I do.

Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",602,677,1990,4.0,4/12/2016,"I know, I know. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain and Yelpers are supposed to focus on eating local, but there is nothing wrong with indulging in your favorite stand by every once in a while. The food is consistently good and of course their cheesecake is sublime. The menu is comically large too so picky and adventurous eaters alike can find something for them. I always order from their Skinny menu though since the normal portions could feed a small army.  My favorites include their flatbreads, Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos, white chicken chili with steamed rice, the little house salad that has a delicious vinaigrette, and the skinny chopped salad sans blue cheese. They also make skinny cocktails and have really good soups. Be sure to ask your server what they are since they change daily.  As far as cheesecake goes, I'm not a big chocolate person so my favorites are Dulce de Leche, the original, strawberry, banana cream, tiramisu, pumpkin, and vanilla bean. I did try a bite of the Kahlua cheesecake once though, and chocolate aside that thing was pretty dang good. The complimentary bread is great too and we always seem to get awesome service.

Amanda M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,12,1,3.0,7/29/2017,"This location just seems to have a few server issues that keep the experience from being very enjoyable.  We went on a Monday evening around 7pm so there was no wait, and not too many people in the restaurant. Yet we were sat at a table that shared a booth seat with 3 other tables, so there were four parties (us included) all smashed together in this little section. While I understand this makes it easier for the server, it was not exactly ideal.  Our server was pretty rude, and at first I tried to kinda excuse it away as just a personality thing. Some people just come across rude, but end up being the nicest people in the world. That was not the case here, sadly.  When we ordered dinner, I ordered a steak and a salad. I don't know why I ordered a steak at a Cheesecake Factory, it was a stupid choice and I'll take the blame for that. Yes, it was gross. No, it was not worth $30.  When he asked what dressing I would like, I hesitated, and thought out loud, ""oh, hmm, I can't remember if it was the ranch or Caesar I didn't really like here."" Which was really just a rhetorical statement to explain my hesitation while I decided. His response was a sigh, and ""I can't help you answer that."" Ooook.  I asked several times for sweet n low for my tea, but gave up on him bringing it after we received and finished eating our appetizer. Luckily, we were an arms reach from the table next to us and they were able to hand me one upon hearing me ask for the billionth time. (Nice Folks)  We ordered cheesecake at the end, and after we told him which kind he went on this long tangent for some coffee cheesecake and we told him ""ok yeah we will just stick with our original ones"", to which he said, ""yeah it's pretty gross, good call"". Um, what? Why did you just try to get us to order it then?  Overall it was fine, but just not a level of service we'd look forward to returning for.

This location is directly across the street from our church so on the way home, it was a must that we went here. It was a busy Sunday, but we were seated rather quickly. Once seated it took a while for our bread and drinks and even though we placed our order right away, it took a while for our meals to arrive. However, once our food arrived we were very satisfied. I had Louisiana Chicken Pasta. (It was really tasty with a nice kick, but not too spicy. I would have liked for my sauce to be a bit thicker). My youngest son had the kids pepperoni pizza (bigger than expected and he loved it. He even ate the crust, which he never does). Oldest son had the salmon ( he liked it but said it needed more seasoning or a sauce and for the price, I felt the portions could have been bigger). Hubby enjoyed the Macaroni burger. He said it was really good and he was so full that he gave the rest to the boys. The hibiscus lemonade was really good, but EXTREMELY sweet! Also I think it could have been a buck or 2 cheaper.

So many options - I was overwhelmed. But, at least there's options for everyone. Prices were a bit high but I think that's a known fact of Cheesecake Factory.  I had the lunch portion of the cobb salad and was not a fan. Forewarning, I'm basically obsessed with cobb salad and appreciate most variations. The portion size was huge. The lettuce and egg were shredded which was off putting for me. The avocado was almost impossible to find. I was disappointed.  The service was good - no complaints here.

We were going to tip him but sense he didn't bring our change back we were just like ok then I guess that will be your tip. The white chocolate macadamia cheese cake. This place has alot of potential. I think a different dish would have made a world of difference.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=20

Leslie M.,"San Antonio, TX",236,156,106,4.0,11/13/2015,"SUMMARY: pretty overpriced for a lot of menu items and especially the wines/drinks (some are $12-$15/glass), but this is definitely worth the visit for the desserts (even the non-cheesecake ones!!) SERVICE: (5*s) our server was also the trainer for other servers and definitely paid great attention to our table. He could have suggested more expensive items but didn't, which I really appreciate. He also said his favorite dessert is the Tiramisu cake (not the cheesecake one). FOOD: (3.5*s) Gluten-free menu is built into the regular menu. Approximately 10 choices to choose from (including a Chocolate Godiva Cheesecake!!) I had the salmon with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. The salmon was grilled and was pretty dry, but fresh. Broccoli was pretty plain and boring. Mashed potatoes were a little too thick, but had decent flavor. Everything was hot. My aunt had two appetizers for her dinner: the grilled artichoke halves (she said it was VERY GOOD, but NOT gluten-free) and Ahi Tuna (she said it had too much marinade on it but was overall pretty good). TIP: artichoke quality varies by if they are in-season so be aware of that before ordering those.  We ordered three different cheesecakes: salted Caramel, red velvet and Godiva (very dense and THE BEST!!!) Red Velvet tasted more like frosting than cheesecake. Salted Caramel was pretty boring. Found out that every cheesecake they have is HANDMADE in a factory offsite (hence, Cheesecake Factory) and they have a giant refrigerator that holds 1,000 whole cheesecakes!! :O AMBIANCE: (3*s) Do NOT come here for a quiet evening--the noise level is very loud and booths are not comfortable. They need to get better cushions because my butt hurt by the end of an hour-long dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=20
Caroline B.,"Colleyville, TX",0,4,1,1.0,11/22/2017,Used to be my favorite restaurant... My daughter is 13 years old and she came here by herself with just some friends. When she asked for a kids menu they gave her lots of pushback about it because the menu says 10 and under. This doesn't make any sense because when we all go as a family they don't even ask and just give her a kids menu. She tried to explain to the server that she didn't want anything off the adult menu and that she couldn't finish that big of a portion. The server took it so far that they got the manager to come over. She said that they could do a side of chicken and a side of veggies. I just don't see the problem. They really just want money because by her eating off the kids menu it will not waste food. Usually very busy but they don't take reservations.

My work team actually requested this place. I ordered the lunch fish and chips, which I assumed was a specialty, because there are only a handful of items on the lunch menu. That was a mistake. The fish pieces were mostly small, and almost all breading. It came with fries and very, very mayonnaise-y slaw. Our group had appetizers, so I took part of lunch to go--my server packed the slaw with the rest...no container, right next to the fish and chips. Liquidy, mayonnaisse-y slaw...touching all the other food.  Avoid this franchise, and this location especially.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=20
Al R.,"Carrollton, TX",28,205,29,4.0,8/17/2015,"Stopped in for lunch. Was able to get a table pretty quickly which is always a bonus.  Tried the fried mac and cheese balls which were outstanding. Just the right amount of crunch and still soft and gooey inside. There are four of them to an order and are a two bite at least size.  I ordered the grilled salmon with the Thai sauce on the side. The salmon was cooked perfectly with great grilled flavor. The Thai sauce was a nice addition to dish and had the right mix of flavors. The mashed potatoes were real and not instant like many places. They have just the right amount of mash and the occasional little chunk of potato mixed in.  The server was OK and the only reason I dropped one star. She did follow up some but had no real personality and didn't try to make it a great dining experience. She was just going through the motions. So nothing rude or inappropriate just blah ..the five star experience has to have the wow factor on food, atmosphere, and service.  Still a great visit and good food.

Carey W.,"Lewisville, TX",43,49,16,3.0,3/13/2016,"Because the manager and server were so respectful concerning our issues, I went ahead and rated it with three stars. However, the cooks and food runners need retraining. Our appetizer was good. But we had to wait for bread to be baked, and my husband's Marsala Chicken was just inedible. The pasta was dry and chewy from sitting in the window aka heat lamps too long and the wine was not cooked off properly.  In addition, our server though he was polite, did not refill our coffees, which were our main drinks, or our waters which we had to start drinking once our coffee got cold. My Skinnylicious Pear Flatbread which I ate for my entree was cooked to perfection.  Of course My husband say there frustrated with his yucky pasta. We had to ask for the manager. One we explained everything, he cryptically mentioned he would do something special for us. We thought oh cool, he'll take off the coffees and maybe even the desserts. He did the desserts (we ordered two cheesecakes to go, before we asked for him) but not the drinks. Really?? So I had to tell our server we refused to pay $3 each for something we didn't even enjoy or really get. That being said, the drinks were taken off and we received a apology from our server. We're not hard on people usually. We just want decent service and food. Why else would we want to spend the money? Lastly don't try to eat the Low Carb Splenda cheesecake, it's awful.

Amy A.,"Grapevine, TX",0,41,1,1.0,10/4/2016,"It was a member of our party's BIRTHDAY. We sat outside like we always do, and Amber was our server. Amber was not a good server, only able to complete one task at a time. We watched her wait on another table for task after task while we just sat. This happened again and again. Both the bread basket and butter bowl came out dirty, but Amber was never available to bring this to her attention. An employee sat at the table next to us and started rolling silverware. It was not relaxing and extremely loud. Amber was not available to tell so I went over and explained it was loud and not relaxing and asked the employee to move. The employee made a snarky remark as she moved, ""I'm moving, Ma'am!"" She moved to the next table over! I'm not kidding! After hearing ten more minutes of rolling, I pulled Amber aside and asked her to have the employee move. Amber spent her time (when not waiting on her other tables) bossing other employees around. ""We don't have many plates over here."" ""These are soup spoons; you can't roll with them."" This wasn't relaxing either. We had empty glasses (both bar and water) and an empty appetizer plate when a six top was seated. They received their drinks, and their order was taken. Then Amber was sat a two top, and instead of checking on us, she went to them. After fifteen additional minutes of waiting with empty everything, we decided we wanted to speak to a manager. When Amber finally came over, we let her know we were unhappy and wanted to speak to a manager. So that we didn't interrupt the diners around us, I went inside to speak to the manager. The manager (Caucasian with brown hair) did not introduce himself or give his name. After explaining my frustration with waiting for service, the manager did not apologize. He was not professional and shrugged off my complaint. I said, ""If you don't believe me, let's go ask the rest of my party about the service we've received."" I literally had to walk the manager out to my party because he didn't believe me and/or care. After listening to my party, the manager said he could get us a new server inside. We explained we came because we wanted to sit outside. We were at a crossroads. No empathy from the manager. No apology. No viable solution. He didn't care at all so we left. There are plenty of places to eat where management cares about the customer's experience. This isn't one.

Alyshia S.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,15,,1.0,4/23/2017,"I wish I could give this place zero stars. I regrettably took some ladies who were visiting from Mississippi to the Cheesecake Factory in Southlake, TX. Thinking they served a great variety of food, and neither of the ladies had been to Cheesecake Factory before. I thought the experience at the Cheesecake Factory would be great. I was wrong. We waited a 45 mins for a table which was to be expected on Saturday night. We ordered and the waitress brought out our food cold. The server who brought out the food offered to remake the food. We accepted the offer. There was an extra 15 to 20 min wait on our food. The food was brought out a second time and was still cold, there was no difference in temperature of the food. We went ahead and ate it cold out of fear that the staff would do something to the food due to the bad service we had already witnessed.  After our waitress brought the food out a second time, the waitress attitude got nasty. She rolled her eyes at us and glared at us, talked with an aggressive tone, threw the checks at us, and didn't refill our drinks. We had to ask a manager to refill our drinks. My friend asked her a question about changing her cheesecake order because she didn't like the Macadamia nuts on a cheesecake the waitress snapped back at her and told her the cheesecake was made already and she couldn't change her order. My friend didn't argue with the waitress out of fear she would spit on her food. The cheesecake wasn't on the table yet, why couldn't they give someone else that order, the cheesecakes are pre made. I don't think my friend knew the cheesecake was pre made since this was her first time at the Cheesecake Factory. After that everyone at the table wanted to leave and was disgusted at their experience, but we wanted to speak with manager and let him know about the poor service and food we received. We talked to manager and he didn't seem to care. He apologized but his body language and tone gave off an ""I don't care attitude"". We paid the bill and left. Regrettably the four of us spend more than $150 combined, but neither the waitress nor the manager cared about that so we left a tip that represented how we felt about the service. I personally had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory in Downtown Fort Worth about a year ago. Similar issue bad service and food and the manager had an ""I don't care attitude"". I won't eat at the Cheesecake Factory again. The service is always bad no matter the location. I was truly embarrassed and regretted my decision to bring my friends to the Cheesecake Factory. I didn't want my friends to think this is how restaurants in the Dallas/Fort Worth area treat their customers.  I'm not coming back there are too many other restaurant choices in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to choose from that treat their customers with respect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=60

It's delicious, and easily the best cheesecake I've ever had. On the rare occasion that I try a more extravagant cheesecake, like dulce de leche or red velvet, I always regret it. You cannot beat the plain cheesecake with strawberries and whipped cream. For an appetizer, I enjoyed their white-bean hummus and pita bread. They always toast the pita bread perfectly, so that it's warm and crispy around the edges and soft in the center. My entree was a very fragrant orange chicken. The sauce is more of a sticky glaze which they toss with carrots and snap peas. I really like the consistency of the orange sauce. It's sweet, tart, and complements the veggies and chicken and rice. Even the lunch portion is enough for two meals, presuming you're having dessert. I've eaten this exact meal 3 times, now.  I had exceptional service today, too.

Wait, wait, wait, here comes the tea and water,  ""I'll be right back with the Margaritas; wait, wait.  MANY minutes after the adult beverages appeared, our assigned server reappeared and took our dinner order. LONG wait, finally plates, on the arms of unfamiliar waitstaff, begin to appear. Five-sixths of the meals, anyway. Ten minutes after the first five were delivered, our original server reappeared and feigned shock at the fact that one plate, an omelet, remained unserved. Five minutes later (she was first caught by another patron wondering about her meal) she delivered the omelet with little in the way of apology, but quick to note that the plate was still quite warm (thus, I can only assume, believing all is good, right?) Neither the omelet eater, nor any of the other five, was ever asked about how their food was, whether anything else (Tabasco, perhaps) might make the meals even better.  Dinner over, one of the diners asked for a to-go box, which, in almost every situation, would suggest to the waiter that things are winding down, and perhaps the final bill, or, before that (this is the Cheesecake Factory after all), desserts be suggested, but not our waiter. She somehow missed the class on understanding your customer's needs, and we waited another fifteen minutes! Another of the diners actually called the restaurant (there was no staff patrolling in any fashion) to ask that our bill be presented!  Bill in hand, we were finally able to exit this forgettable evening and find another way to celebrate the new job. We'll be going out for dessert, because The Cheesecake Factory failed to live up to its name, or to their pledge of customer satisfaction.

But they do.  My friends and family have ordered quite an array of items over the years and we have never been disappointed.  Drinks, pasta, steak, seafood, desserts... All done to perfection. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food they ar serving.  I've had mostly great service save for a few times it wasn't that great but it won't deter from giving them a 5-star rating.  I'm there a few times a month.  Yes the line is long on peak times but we wait in the bar and it's no big deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=80
Bob F.,"Keller, TX",41,59,,2.0,11/5/2016,"The experience: We sat down within five (5) minutes. Within another five (5) minutes the wait service person greeted and menus were presented, and order made.  Pit Deep Dip, and 2 Eggs w/bacon.  Then the wait over twenty-two (22) minutes, and food arrived. Pit Deep Sandwich with beef Au Jus Sauce on the side. Sandwich was cold and the Au Jus Sauce with cold.  The Eggs w/ bacon cold. The only thing served warm was the two little loaves bread on the table before the order taken. After action:  I spoke to the server who fault is it?  The food was cold. He got a little defensive. I told all as well, we are dealing with facts. Is it you or the cooks? He said, he served as soon as it was set up. He avoided a direct answer. This was my first time there. We won't be back unless it's just for the cheesecake.  Total tine sixty-two (62) minutes. They also out the suggested gratuity on the check 22%, 20%, 18% 15% on top of  the sales tax on it. I never like that and never will.  Note: you never tip on the sales tax. I tipped 15%, but the service was nothing special; it deserve 10%. Some times the best tip you can give it tell the wait person what they did wrong. The guy was observed visiting to much and not on his job with customers. Oh yes, also observed he blew it on another table order and failed to get the order right and after they were all finished came back with a similar apology and served the food to the poor left out person and offered a piece of free Cheesecake.  The place was not that busy... poor attention.  * I will not recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=80
Marcus W.,"Queen Creek, AZ",339,444,37,3.0,6/30/2014,"After driving by this restaurant location a couple of times and seeing unusually long lines I was ready to give up on visiting this Southlake location. After noticing there were no lines, the family took a stab at dropping in, and were seated within minutes. The restaurant is large and can accommodate large groups when necessary. They have a covered patio area that I would imagine is more popular in less humid months. The menu is overwhelming. It's literally a 25-page bound ""book"" with small print to fit their seemingly endless list of dining/drinking options.  Give yourself time to digest what they have to offer, it's a lot.  Our server was friendly enough but rather absent minded. He switched drink orders upon first delivery, missed a couple of specific order requests (no tomatoes on one dish, dressing on the side, etc.)- things that could have easily been resolved by listening to the guests. He was quick to remedy most of the issues and delivered an apology as well, all good. The place is a little noisy, so be prepared to use your loud voice when you come with friends or family. I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich while the wife got the low calorie turkey sandwich with green salad. Portions were plentiful on both dishes. The BBQ was decent, albeit a little dry. The coleslaw it was served with was very good (on the wetter side, but that's how I like mine). The fries were crisp and delicious! There's a decent kids menu to order from, co-listed in the normal adult menu. Of course, we split a slice of cheesecake at the end of our meal. We ordered the caramel turtle, and there was a huge dollop of chocolate frosting on the top, almost cemented to the cheesecake slice. It was a little too much and overwhelmed the rest of the dessert. Our daughter couldn't get enough.

Matt F.,"Hurst, TX",3,16,13,1.0,4/23/2017,"I'll start by saying I come to this Cheesecake Factory all the time and this is the first bad experience I've had. My wife and I were seated at a two top relatively quickly and it was busy so that was good. However as we're seated I can hear our waiter (Evan I think his name was. Sorry to name drop but you did a terrible job pal) telling the table next to us ""I'm so sorry again, and I hope this won't prevent you from coming back here.""  Obviously we weren't the only table Evan was screwing up that afternoon. He was very pleasant and had a good attitude but the kid couldn't keep his head on straight. We ordered and asked for sweet and low for my wife's tea...THREE times I asked for it until I finally asked another waitress who brought it to us. We ask for bread and 10 minutes later we can see him walking over with the bread to us then he turns another corner and he's gone  again...Same thing when we asked for a to-go container. Then all of a sudden Evan and some other waiter come up behind the other waitress as she gave us my wife's salad and sweet and low...Theme of the night because they did all of Evan's work for our table while he looked goofy and laughed with other waiters at the ordering computer. So Evan and another waiter are in our face saying ""That's not your salad, it has tomatoes in it."" She ordered a tossed salad. Evan says you can have that though if you want it. Ok, perfect so she eats it. Apparently Evan went back and charged us another $2 for the salad because it had 4 tiny tomato wedges in it and NEVER even told us. Apparently a tossed salad here is just greens and a few drops of salad dressing with no tomato's, croutons or anything else.

As for drinking I asked water with lemons ( I never got the lemons..) I asked the waitress for a high chair ,she never bought one . so I asked a different waiter and he got me then one. I ordered a salad for me and for my baby a cheese cesadia ,which I promptly changed for the salmon with mashed potatoes from the kids menu. For my salad I asked dressing on the side and lemons .  The salad had some pretty bitter leaves of salad.. Only after repeated asking she bought my dressing on the side. A waiter came and bought the cheese casadia ( I canceled it before to get the salmon) ,so my waitress told him it's canceled and I'm supposed to get salmon .  Anyhow after finally getting the food for my  baby,I already finished my food.  It seemed like she forgot  that I also need more water .  Anyhow I wanted just to leave so I ordered a slice of cheesecake and asked for my check ,which took a while . after opening the check I see she tried charging me not only for the food I received but also for the cheese cesadia ,which I right away confronted her and she said she will fix it .

Here's the rub: my wife found two 1""x1"" pieces of aluminum foil in her Shepherd's Pie and actually accidentally swallowed a third piece. I mentioned it to our server, who was very apologetic, and told him I didn't want to make a big deal out of it but to let him know so he can tell the cook to watch out next time so it doesn't happen to someone else.  The manager then came over a few minutes after and just apologized for it and walked off. I then leaned over to my wife and said to her, ""If this manager/boss truly cares about the customer's experience and not just about the bottom line, our ticket will have your meal comped."" The check arrives and low and behold: no comp and not even a free dessert NOR did they even offer to take the food away and bring her a fresh one!! Give me a break! I get that it was just 2 little pieces of aluminum foil (actually 3 since my wife accidentally ATE ONE) and in the grand scheme of things it wasn't that bad (like hair or bugs in food) but the sheer fact that the manager didn't do ANYTHING to show culpability or accountability is what really bothers me. It can't just be about the bottom-line when it comes to the restaurant business. You HAVE to care about the overall experience these days, or else you won't have any people in your restaurant to begin with.

I called to let the restaurant know we were disappointed and the person who answered the phone told me it wasn't their fault but I could talk to the manager. The manager came to the phone and also told me it wasn't their fault, that it was the Door Dash drivers fault the food was not prepared nor packed right and if I wasn't happy with the food to tell Door Dash. Both people were extremely argumentative. All I wanted was an I'm sorry you weren't satisfied with the quality of the food and we appreciate you letting us know, but instead I got an argument and finger pointing to Door Dash. We have ordered from Door Dash from many local restaurants and been very satisfied with what we received. I hate writing reviews, I never do it, but because the staff at Cheesecake was SOOOOO argumentative I joined Yelp just so I could give them a bad review. So, as the norm, I enjoy eating at Cheesecake because I enjoy the experience, but the manager(if he really was the manager) has dropped Cheesecake from my list of choices and, from the other reviews I read, I am not alone in how the manager has responded to a dissatisfied customer.

Kate R.,"Dallas, TX",80,421,62,3.0,6/11/2014,"So here's the thing.  Cheesecake Factory accidentally tried to kill me.  The boyfriend and I went there one Saturday to get the best soup ever (creamy chicken artichoke), ordered our soup and a meal to split, and waited. When our soup was delivered, the bf dug right in. I knew something was off the minute it was placed in front of me. I asked him if it tasted funny, and he said it was great and kept eating. I took one bite and knew that it was off. A second bite quickly told me this is definitely NOT creamy chicken artichoke, it was something with seafood. Holy shit, this is clam chowder. Oh my god.  Now, those of you that know me (or have read my reviews) know that I eat NOTHING FROM THE SEA.  Only after I said ""SEAFOOD!"" did my boyfriend realize he was eating clam chowder. He loves seafood and clam chowder (and he eats really quickly), so he didn't notice.  We called the server over and he was really non-chalant. ""Oh. Man. Sorry. I don't know how long we've been serving that. The kitchen is still telling everyone it's chicken."" As I run to the bathroom to try not to die, my boyfriend deals with it.  When I come back out, the manager is there and he is super super apologetic.  It was an awful experience and we didn't go back for about 5 months. When we did start to go back, the service was spotty at best. They had seen a LOT of turnover and the new servers were not up to par.  Now, the best waiter in the entire world, Lee, makes up for all of that mess. We always ask for him when we go in. They changed the chicken artichoke soup to Sundays (which sucks, but it is what it is), and Lee always quadruple checks that it's chicken before brings it to me. He was NOT the waiter on that night, but we mentioned it to him and he apologized to us for about 20 minutes. He is seriously one of the best in the entire business. He knows his customers, likes his regulars, jokes with us, and takes excellent EXCELLENT care of us every single time. Even if he's worked open til close for four days in a row, he's still on his game. I give Lee 6 stars because he really goes that much above and beyond.  If Lee isn't there, it's hit or miss. It's been better in the past couple of months (I know that Lee has been training a couple of new hires, so maybe that's the difference), but if Lee isn't around, we lower our expectations a little. It's kind of sad, but there you go.  Go on Sunday, eat the chicken artichoke soup, sit in Lee's section if he's there. You'll probably see us somewhere over there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=100

Ciara U.,"North Richland Hills, TX",37,31,14,3.0,4/17/2015,"I am giving this location 3 stars for a few reasons. I would like to say first that I've been here several times so this is not a one time bad experience review. I would say out of the 10-12 times I have visited I have had 5 bad experiences but none of those times were food related. The food has always been top notch and delicious. While the prices are high, the portions are large and the food tastes fresh and delicious!  So here is where the loss of 2 stars comes for me. When I visit with only my husband or only a girlfriend I seem to have great service. If I'm there with a few friends they treat me like a teenager (I will be 30 this year and we do not act like teenagers in public so nothing warrants this) and if I bring my kid I might as well go back home. Once I was there with my husband and our son (he was 5 at the time and being very well behaved). We were around 3rd in line waiting for a table and we waited for 45 minutes before I asked the hostess when we would be seated. She told me she had called our name ""several times and we had not responded"". Well the problem with that theory is that I had been watching the hostess stand the entire time because it was loud in there. Our buzzer had also not gone off but she could not explain that. Instead of offering us the next table she put us back in line. After about 20 minutes she seated someone who had just arrived and was in the same size party, so I calmly informed them that we were leaving and I would like to speak with a manager. The manager could not be bothered with me and didn't care. So I contacted corporate and they sent me a gift card.  Another time when I sat down at my table I had completely dirty silverware but it had been set by someone. So someone set the table and didn't notice there was literally a bite of cheesecake still sitting on a fork (no exaggeration). However our service that day was otherwise good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=100

This was really good guacamole. It comes with a side of Pico De Gallo, be sure to put that on your chip with the guacamole. It is awesome, We couldn't stop eating this stuff.  Top shelf margarita wasn't so good - it tasted like sweet and sour mix. I think top shelf means it tastes smooth because you are getting the higher quality liquor and liquer in the drink.

David B.,"Flower Mound, TX",184,83,97,4.0,4/8/2012,I was first exposed to the Cheesecake Factory in LA and had a great experience. Once I learned that there was a Cheesecake Factory close to home I gave it a try again. It has been consistently good from one location to another. I particularly like the Meso Salmon on a bed of steamed rice and for dessert just about any cheesecake but specifically the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  During peak times expect a long wait as they don't take reservations. Eating outside is nice even when it's cold they have adequate outdoor heating.  Located on the back side of Southlake Town Center. They do have to go parking if you are picking up. It's located adjacent to the back side of the building.

Brad N.,"Frisco, TX",486,1057,234,3.0,7/29/2012,"As I mentioned to a co-worker when I learned that this venue had been chosen for a going-away luncheon: ""At least we'll have enough food for lunch and dinner"". His response: ""Yeah, for three days"". :) Such is the legend of Cheesecake Factory, with their classically huge portions. Unfortunately, my experience with the quality side of the equation has been less than stellar, but I was hopeful on this, my first visit to this location.  Inside, it looks like most of the other CF locations I've been to: Big, grandiose and fancy. We were seated quickly, as our group had made reservations. Drinks were ordered and served without delay, as was the pre-meal bread served along with butter; it was a decent loaf but not outstanding, somewhat of a mild sourdough.  Perusing the extensive menu, I had to chuckle when I found a dish that, in its description, read in part ""huge burrito"". If CF says it's ""huge"", how big is THAT? I decided to give it a miss in favor of the lunch portion of shepard's pie. It's a little unconventional, but all of the right ingredients are there: brown sauce, carrots (slivered, in this case), ground beef, peas and a nice mashed potato topping, but served in a bowl with the potatoes as a ""shmear"" on top, rather than baked together. It wasn't a bad dish, but it could have used more flavor. It tasted much like the sum of the ingredients, no more.  We decided to forego dessert as we were having snacks back at the office later, so no cheesecake this time. This was probably one of the better meals that I've had at this chain, but I prefer something with a little more taste ""character"" when I spend this much money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=120

Joe I.,"Argyle, TX",0,6,5,2.0,12/24/2014,"I know that it's Christmas Eve but you expect for a place like this to be prepared for a busy night.  We came early knowing that last year, there was a 3hr wait during peak time.  We came at 4pm and were told a 20 minute wait.  After 45 minutes, we were told that their buzzers were not working so they lost track of people's seating sequence.  Finally after being seated, it only got worse.  Ten minutes pass before our waitress shows up, takes our drinks and moves on.  Another 10 minutes pass by before water  is served. She leaves before we can get our appetizers ordered. After the ordering ordeal, my medium-well burger comes out charred.  My kid's bow tie pasta was like chewing on a rubber band. And the delay to get drinks was unbelievable.  I informed our waitress of my meal, she did take it off our tab but not until I pointed it out that I was still charged for it.  By this point, I had made up my mind that I would never be coming back again.  Then, an interesting chain of events took place.  The manager, Ellery, came over and deeply apologized for the mishap.  Not only did he not make any excuses but went on to tell me that he would make things right if we gave his establishment another try and to ensure that we would not have a repeat of our experience, he gave me his card and said to ask for him when we come back.  If he had to, he would personally service our table. This is the type of customer relations that you expect from these type of higher end restaurants.  I give this a 2 star experience but give Ellery 5 stars for handling the situation professionally.  We frequent this location quite often and we had decided to not come back but because of Ellery's decision to manage the situation with the utmost highest level of customer service, we will be giving this location another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=120

I went here for lunch and had the lunch-sized portion of shepherd's pie.  It was good, and I cleaned my plate - it's just that the sauce or whatever they use on their food - it's just too ""much"".  Like, I couldn't actually taste the meal because the sauce was so overly-flavorfull - too many spices - like it's not real food.   And why do I never ever see anyone ever order the cheesecake!?  It's a nice place - big and it has that cool decor that is oh-so Cheesecake Factory.  Our waiter was certainly nice enough.  I'm just done with the food.  I'll go if I have to - but on my own I'll never choose to go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=120
Haley K.,"North Richland Hills, TX",67,530,71,3.0,1/17/2012,"Pros: Large portions; my mom, 4 year old and I usually split one plate and one of their small dishes/appetizer.  Variety of foods.  Desert: We've liked everything we've gotten from here. Cheesecake- I am not a big cheesecake fan but I like the various flavors from here. More than likely not made from scratch on site but I honestly having worked food service not very many restaurants make deserts from scratch.  They bring a bread & fruit appetizers for my kiddo when she comes with us; which I really appreciate!    Cons:  Price: While you certainly get the amount of food for the money in most cases, I can see how you can easily run a 40-50 tab for two people.  The food has never been really bad; but I have not been really knocked out of the park by anything I've gotten. The times we were; we ordered it again another visit and wasn't as impressed.  It can get REALLY busy here; so sometimes on date night we eat somewhere else in the town center & go there just for desserts & drinks or just pick it from their dessert bar. Even then if you sit down for drinks and desert we've been there for 45-hour just for dessert. While we've had great service and bad service the most interesting times have been when we do just do dessert. Even though it usually turns into a 15-20 tab depending on what you get; you usually get ignored for the most part for the tables ordering meals. I.E. drinks not being refilled, having to flag someone down for the check or Togo boxes when necessary, etc Which I understand your pushing for bigger tips on the bigger tickets but when most tickets are 40-50 I'd expect fairer treatment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=120

As Jim Gaffigan once said, I like bread OK, but when I go to a restaurant I CRAVE bread. It's very good here, though I haven't had to cancel my entree because I ate too much of it :) I usually go for the Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya. Definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've had. I've tried other things as well and they've been good. Now, there is really no cheesecake like The Cheesecake Factory. I don't know if it's because there are so many calories in them or what, but they are literally to-die-for. I could see myself taking a bullet or two for a bite. Anyway, I've tried tons of them and think my favorite was the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Only negative is these things are SO rich, so it's very tough to finish one after you've already filled up on food and bread.

The cheesecakes are great, but for a healthy diet, they are just too big.  Last night's dinner was horrible. We ordered a new thing on the menu (yesterday was the first day serving it) Portabello, Zucchini and Avocado Fries. The waitress came back and tol use they are out of portabello mushrooms, they can serve the other two and it will be on the house. They did taste pretty good, but I missed the mushroom. The jambalaya pasta we ordered was very bland. It had no spice and was lacking something. I ordered off the Skinnylicious menu, and though the salad sounded good, the flavors did not complement each other at all. It was the Fresh Vegetable Salad. I am all about my veggies, but it was not a good  mixture.  The service was good, I can't complain.

I chose Cheesecake Factory (mostly to get away from the horrible Christmas traffic in Grapevine) and ended up having a ridiculously good time. They tried to sit us near a giant table of children who happened to be singing happy birthday to one of the kids and I was not about to have a six year old steal my birthday thunder. They were very nice when I asked if they would mind if we sat in the bar area instead. Our bartender/waiter was awesome. He was super friendly, was actually funny and not just please-give-me-a-good-tip funny, and rounded up another bartender to sing happy birthday to me, also getting my very shy husband in on the act. He also gave us free dessert. In exchange I left him my birthday button and all the birthday dollars that I had received that day as a tip. He was that good - he earned all of my good birthday karma. Also, somehow Cheesecake Factory manages to make every dish perfectly despite having 30,000 things on the menu. I had the eggplant sandwich and it was magical. My husband had enchiladas and loved them.

Of course...if I am there...I am always making fun of how UFC reminds me of gay porn...almost Mystery Science Theatre 3000 style. So in attempt to get the ladies out of the house and have fun with my girlfriends...we opted to go to Cheesecake.  It was my idea to go to Cheesecake versus Chilli's or On the Border. You can go to Cheesecake and there is something for everyone since the menu is as big as a phonebook. I thought this could satisfy the pickest of eaters. We arrive and put our names on the list for first available seating. We ended up on the patio. There was plenty of heat lamps to keep us warm. As the patio cleared...it started to get a little chilly...but not so cold where we would have to go back in. Our server was all over the place...since I have been a waitress before...I could understand. He was busy but he did come by to say hi and take our drink orders. He was very nice.  I ordered the chicken madera...which is one of their signature dishes. Blondie ordered sliders...and our other friends ordered chicken wraps and a pasta dish. I am not a huge cheesecake fan...and I was so full from my chicken madera that I didnt get dessert. I usually order Linda's Fudge Cake with tons of whip cream. Everyone enjoyed what they had.  I dont eat out as much as I used to....but this is a great first date place and nice place to eat period.

Kathryn D.,"Colleyville, TX",0,9,5,3.0,3/14/2015,"This is a review of the ""curbside to go"". I just waited on hold for the Cheesecake Factory Curbside-To-Go to place an order for ten minutes with hold music. Then on my other phone line, I decided to call and see if they just forgot about me, because no one had picked up the line to at least let me know to continue holding or inform me that they were busy? It's 8pm, so I didn't think it would be rush hour here. Anyways, a manager eventually came to the phone after another 3 minutes on hold to take my order. She told me they were really busy and that my order would be at least 30 minutes. I told her I was fine with that. When I asked her for suggestions on ""sushi like"" appetizers that she could suggest for the to go service (since they still cannot serve their ahi tartare on the to go menu because they do not have their sushi license), her response was I don't think we have anything else ""sushi or fish like on the appetizer menu for to go"" and then I asked if she was a manager and she said ""yes"" and then said ""I'm new and I don't have the menu memorized yet"". I realize this is a huge menu but WHHHAAATTTTT? A manager who doesn't know the menu of their own restaurant. Is this not restaurant management training 101?  Then after I told her ""I'm sure you have something fish like that's cooked and that I am in my car and don't have a menu"" she fumbled around and then suggested the shrimp spring rolls ... that was a good pull on her part - hopefully she picked up a menu to read at this point.  Not sure about this place any more. The last time I took food home from here one month ago (the miso salmon) it made my stomach sick. I didn't write a review last month when this happened but decided to try the same miso salmon again tonight to see if the food has changed from one month ago. Hopefully, when I get my food this time, it makes up for the lack of service on the curbside-to-go business. In the past this restaurant was spot on. I've been ordering miso salmon here for 6 years now ... Giving it another chance ... but making sure I write a review so that they can read it and make some improvements ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=160

Brett I.,"Harrison, NJ",264,344,86,4.0,3/18/2012,"Cheesecake Factory--regardless if you like it or don't, you have to admire its consistency; the overall quality of the dining experience doesn't really change depending on location. The ambience, the quality of the wait staff, the large portions of food--it's all super consistent. I came here with a large group (about 12 of us), but our server was so attentive and cool with us--just so friendly, always checking up on us, refilling drinks, etc. I ordered the roasted vegetable pizza (roasted veggies consist of red bell pepper, artichoke, mushrooms, diced tomatoes). One friend around me ordered the chicken bellagio, another ordered the cajun jambalaya pasta, another ordered an old-fashioned ""glamburger,"" i can't remember what the rest ordered. Anyhow, I liked my pizza--the crust was well-done (not too thick, not too thin), the toppings were generous, and it tasted good overall. It was around $13, which I found to be worth it. My friend's chicken bellagio dish (chicken on top of pasta with a basil/oil sauce and an arugula salad) was really good; the waiter said it's one of the best items on the menu. The not-so good thing was my friend's jambalaya pasta. It sounded kind of cool, but i suppose pasta doesn't match as well with all the jambalaya ingredients as rice does; the dish was just kind of bland  overall. I don't know when they introduced the SkinnyLicious menu, but they had a ""light"" menu this time we went, which is good if that's your thing. In Cheesecake Factory fashion, it's a large menu for lighter fare. and lastly, it's called the cheesecake factory for a reason.

Also this happened a few months ago on July 29th 2013 and I really wanted to have a cold head before writing this.  This was the first time I ever ate at a cheese cake factory and I made sure I went to the South Lake location because it's a really nice area and I wanted to treat my little sister who came to visit from another country. Our waiter was really great right from the start, very attentive. Kudos to him and I'm actually really mad at myself for not remembering his name to give him Kudos.  My sister order steak and I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp. When we got our food it looked great, we were so excited but it ended there. I usually don't inspect my food but when I looked down I saw what I thought was a shrimp leg and with my nail I pulled it out and to my surprise it was a cockroach, the whole insect. Having my sister there I really didn't want to make a scene, after all she was the one that was really exited about eating there. So I called the waiter and pointed to my food, poor guy looked so embarrassed and took my plate right away.  At that point my sister's excitement was gone. The manager came and apologize many times. He then asked me to write my name, address and number to later give me a call and he mentioned that they need to communicate this to the exterminator company. I never had this happened so I was very much disgusted and more worried about my sister's impression.  I didn't pay for my food but did for our drinks and my sister's food but we pretty much didn't eat anything afterwards. They also gave us cheese cakes and as much as I wanted I couldn't bear to eat them. Months after that happened I haven't received a call or anything. Looking back I would probably done things much different.  It's also safe to say that I won't be going to any other Cheese cake factory restaurant.

The Cheesecake Factory is one of the only places I've ever been that can pretty much satisfy any appetite.  If you have a group of picky eaters then this is your place!  I know it's known for ""bad"" food as in high calorie, high sodium, but it's anything BUT bad.  They even have a ""skinny"" menu for people looking out for calories.  One of the things on it is the miso glazed salmon which is really incredible.  I try to get something different every time I go and that's a difficult proposition with all of the choices.  I suggest looking at the menu online before you go.  It can be daunting when faced with the numerous choices and a wait person coming back asking if you're ready yet.   One thing I recommend are the small plates.  When I'm with friends we'll get two of these and they're really not that small.  White bean hummus, stuffed mushrooms with a wonderful sauce, even the fried cheese...yum! BEWARE:  The food is huge.  Don't think of this place as an appetizer, main course, dessert type of restaurant.  If you ate all of those on the scale they serve it on they would have to wheel you out in a cart.  This is not a bad thing since you will have leftovers to put in the oven the next day (or night after a few drinks).  During lunch they have smaller portions that are still pretty big.  For the price you're probably getting twice the food of most places. Service:  I've never had anything but exceptional service at this place.  The wait staff seems to enjoy their job even though they're super busy all the time.  Yes, I eat here often. The only reason I give four stars is because of the seating situation.  I hate it!  They try to pack in as many diners as possible into their extremely large restaurant.  That means if you're two up you might be sitting right next to a big family.  Do I put up with it...yes, because the food is that good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=160

Adam G.,"Keller, TX",5,13,5,2.0,8/10/2013,"I want to clarify my rating by saying if you read my review you'll understand why only 2 stars.  The review reflects my personal bias, but some of the factors probably would affect another customer as negatively.  With that said, on to the review... After having seen the Chain represented in the Big Bang Theory, I always had a desire to give the place a try.  Finally tonight myself, my wife and a friend decided to visit the one located in Southlake, TX.  For starters the decor is pretty elaborate, the type of decorations you might find in a very fancy expensive restaurant.  Aesthetically it's not personally my taste but it's Nicely decorated.      The entryway was extremely crowded, most likely because it was a weekend evening.  The estimated wait was 30-40 minutes.  Here is one of the places where the restaurant lost the most favor with me.  With a wait that long you really need to have ample place for people to sit.  They didn't have anywhere near the accommodations to seat that many waiting patrons.  I have a personal issue with waiting for ANY restaurant that has a wait that is longer then 20 minutes.  It is my humble opinion that any restaurant that has a wait longer then that isn't worth going to.  Since the evening in that respect was out of my control, we waited it out. The food in my experience was average to mediocre, and a bit overpriced for what they gave you.  i think the menu overall while having a lot of diversity which is good, tries a little to hard, and is a bit pretentious.  I personally had the BBQ burger which IMHO was not as good as a Red Robin Whisky River burger as a comparison.  The seating I was very unhappy with as well.  The tables are WAY to close together, you are practically sitting on top of the people next to you and it's impossible to NOT hear their conversations, which I find uncomfortable.  The seats themselves, if you are a larger person like me are very poorly padded and become uncomfortable to sit in rather quickly. Their Desserts, namely cheesecake is excellent and I might even suggest if you are to eat anything there, I would suggest taking some of that to go if you're like me and don't want to dine in that particular place. Lastly the wait staff, I just want to say that even with my negative comments about this restaurant, I have to give credit to our Waitress, she was exceptional.  She was attentive, got our orders 100% correct, was on top of refills, updates on our food, and her personality was awesome.  Friendly and charming.  I personally wish she worked somewhere else because I would have loved to go back to a restaurant i could enjoy with her waiting on me. Also FYI, the restaurant does not accept reservations on the weekend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=180

But here is the rub.  The food was OK, and the portions were very generous, another Cheesecake Factory trademark.  Soft drinks were $3 so we all had water.  We each ordered a slice of cheesecake to go (starting at $7.95) and our tab for our family of four, including tip, was $91.46!  For lunch!  With no alcohol!

Ok, I am mad because the door host taking names told me it was a 20-25 minute wait for 2 people at 5pm on a Saturday.  It then turned into 45 minutes before we reached the table. During this time, I watched MANY people pour into the restaurant.  They were all told about THE SAME wait time as the people before them - 30 minutes. After awhile, it was really pretty ridiculous.  No way would it be 30 minutes for so many people arriving at the same time!!  I don't like being lied to.  I worked in restaurants during college and we could always predict the wait time fairly accurately.  Oh yes, my appetizer arrived when my meal was nearly half over.

Allison B.,"Hurst, TX",9,15,,4.0,1/19/2010,"I know most people get down on this place but I've gotta tell ya, I'm a fan! I've been to several different ones throughout my life and have been to the Southlake area one about three times. The latest being this past Saturday.  I think of this place like a nice steak place. It's something that you treat yourself to, not go to every week.  And yes, believe what they tell you, it is crowded. But, clearly a crowded restaurant means it's worth trying. It must be that good. We were told there would be about a 45 minute wait and we were seated before that time was up. (There was only two of us so I realize it's easier to get a table). Service was great, no complaints there. The food is what brings me back though. Every time I've ordered something new, it's met my expectations and beyond.  Boyfriend got the fish and chips which was ridiculously delicious (and I don't even like fish!) and I ordered the Spicy Meat Pizza. This pizza has given me a new look on life. I now am OBSESSED with carmelized onions. This pizza would have been good with just the meat, but with these, it elevated it to levels beyond our imagination.   Of course I got the cheesecake, took it home and ate it two days later! Definitely a restaurant to try if you haven't been. A little expensive but reserve it for a special day.  If you go with a group, make time to be there for a couple of hours but who doesn't want to spend a little more time with their friends anyway?

Glenn H.,"Pacifica, CA",149,660,557,5.0,8/13/2007,"Ahh what a difference a day and about 1,700 miles makes . Sunday Brunch at the Palo Alto, CA CF was stunted by hideous service and management. This place at Southlake, was pretty full for a Monday evening and I decided to see if I was wrong about my general impression of the CF.  Good news is that I was and this place redeemed itself mightily, yeah even I sayest unto you dear diner. I had the Factory Meatloaf: three thick slabs of good meatloaf (a bit on the sagey side but still  fantastic), with a 3 pepper, corn & squash saute that was perfect, two hot lengths of bread (sweet pumpernickel and white) and a small hill of mashed spuds with gravy. OMG, guys this was the redeemer. The service was SO good compared to the Palo Alto, that I got my Iced tea (unsweetened passion fruit MMmmm) and bread, had some, then went to tidy up in the men's room---when I returned, I thought I was in the Twilight Zone. (Neer neer NEER neer)--Repeat as you read this. For there, were my bread and tea used to be, was an EMPTY table devoid of butter, napkin too.  Huh? Wha happen to my stuff? Thank goodness another table saw my confusion and the 80 year old birthday boy said ""You were right there, Sonny boy."", pointing with his knife. ""You want some of my leftovers?"" (Holds up CF doggy bag) So the waiter (who rocked--Holla Aaron!) apologized and brought me out a whole new set of everything and then my order came PERFECTLY done. The difference could not have been more pronounced between Heaven and Hell (guess which CF was which).

I think the food at the cheesecake factory is really good -- WAY better than what you get at your average chain restaurant.  I'm a huge fan of the orange chicken, the chicken piccata, the burrito, the fish tacos, and lots of other stuff on their extensive (to the point of being ridiculous) menu.  Until we tried it one day, we never realized that this was a place to get an excellent breakfast/order-off-the menu brunch.  Their French Toast Napoleon is maybe some of the best french toast that I've had anywhere, but maybe that's because it's so loaded up with strawberries and cream that it's unclear whether it is a breakfast or a dessert.  The cheesecake, or course, is also some of the best anywhere, but..... My biggest gripe is with the price.  I think it is impossible for 2 people to eat here and spend less than $40.  Even for lunch.  I sure don't have the time to go through their textbook-sized menu and add up all of the combinations, but I'm sure it's true.  $8 for a freaking piece of cheesecake?  Come on.  Granted, the portion sizes are so large that you are essentially buying two (or more) meals at once, but I'd rather buy my meals one at a time, thank you..... There can be a long wait at busy times, but the secret is just to avoid this place at those times (duh.)  I never wait.  I've never had any complaints about the service.  So, I'm a fan, but I always wonder if I'm being scammed when I end up spending $50 for two lunch entrees, drinks, and 2 pieces of cheesecake.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=180

My wife had the Chicken Bellagio which is a flattened and breaded chicken breast served on top of basil pasta in a cream sauce.  The prosciutto and arugula on top made for an outstanding dish. We shared a piece of the Tuxedo Chocolate Cheesecake to finish and it was gone in about 2 minutes between both of us.  Service from Jasmine was top-notch and very friendly.

Ryan B.,"Richardson, TX",222,395,202,2.0,1/14/2009,"This place (and its ilk) are what is wrong with American dining: First, it is mass-market food, designed in focus groups. There is nothing creative or original here. (""Oooh, tomatoes and basil on bread!"") The food takes no risks, has no appreciable level of spice, or any challenging combinations of herbs or textures. This is 'safe' food for adults who, as kids, would only eat hot dogs.  Next, I suspect C.F. was independently responsble for the Huge Portion trend that has taken over American dining. This gorge factor has contributed to rising Fat-abetes rates. Have you seen the trough of food they give you? I mean, really, this is obscene. Pass me my feed bag, I mean, to go box. I don't need the entire package of pasta! I don't want the entire head of lettuce for my salad. Now just about every restaurant is sacrificing quality for the Holy Grail of Quantity. Restaurants like C.F. strive for the review of, ""OMG, you get so much food for your money!"" Charge me more, give me less, but make it good.  And finally, it is ugly as hell and over-crowded. It looks like Liberace and Kimoro Simons had a contest to see who could design the most garish Las Vegas Casino. In the 1990s. Bright, disorganized, random, overly-flashy and way-to-polished.

Can get loud and if sitting at tables you are sitting VERY close to the next group.  Not very good for privacy. 7. Drinks are really expensive and average. 8. Not the best place for children. So ... looks like the winner is obvious.  It is probably worth a try but there are far better options out there.  Money would be better spent and stretch farther elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=200
Brenda S.,"Euless, TX",382,14,,4.0,7/18/2012,"Always lots of food enough for two meals or two people to share. The waitstaff smiled even though I had a friend with me that's older and she likes to make a lot of small talk. They humored her. My only complaint was the alcohol drinks were weak , I had long island iced tea, the champagne was very good and my teenager her green tea had a huge mint leaf in it  and it made it very strong mint flavored. I got the hamburger with cheddar and bacon and fries...did not like the fries they tasted like frozen food..my burger was great there..but when reheated the leftover at home it tasted bad and I threw it out. It's a very warm inviting place to sit for a long time and enjoy good company. Cheesecake we chose this time was brownie sundae....wonderful!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=200
Gopi V.,"Fremont, CA",4,334,4,4.0,1/11/2011,"Just like any other cheesecake factory: great atmosphere and good food with a lot of varieties. My only gripe, a long wait for food.

Suzie L.,"Oceanside, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/11/2013,"I loved the cheesecake factory! My husband and I went a few weeks ago. It was our first visit.  (Waitress was Kim, she's very sweet) The inside interior is very beautifully decorated. I wish the staff didn't have to wear all white strange mental hospital looking uniforms. It kinda kills the whole restaurant.  My husband ordered the factory burrito, which was huge. (Comes with very good black beans, sour cream and guacamole) It was very tasteful. Full of flavor. Pretty good for a non mexican restaurant. I had the Chicken Madeira. This was so delicious. I would recommend it if you like sweet wine and asparagus. The chicken is smothered in melted cheese, and the side is normally mashed potatoes. If I ordered this again, I might try a different side if that's an option. Not that the potatoes were bad, they were very rich and creamy. I'm just not sure if that would be an appropriate side because the Chicken itself is very filling and mashed potatoes will really pack up some room in your stomach.  Now for the dessert. There's so much to choose from. We finally decided to get the Banana Cream Cheesecake. It was very very pleasing. The cheesecake is perfect. It's topped with whipped cream and fresh sliced banana. It reminded me of banana cream pie.  We would absolutely come back here. Food was amazing and the service was nothing but fast and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=200
Preston B.,"Queens, NY",25,100,1,3.0,7/8/2007,"OK... I have also been to 4 different locations and I don't think this is 5 stars.... at all. The one here in SF is worse than the southlake one, Imagine it being in the middle of a million person town and in the center of the shopping/tourist section. Waits AVERAGE around 2 hours every single day. So in southlake here, when I went, it was about a 45 minute wait and my mom tells me on weekdays it is almost no wait. There is nothing AT ALL different between any of the locations except wait time. From what I have noticed they all seem to have terrible service and timing. I usually always get the bread about 20 minutes after being seated and they apologize EVERY single time saying that there is backup in the oven... okay.... let's correct this problem... since it ALWAYS happens at every single location. The Dinners are not grand... but they have grand prices... why? Why does a chicken dish need to be $19? No I can't afford cheescake... which is the reason I came in the first place. The service staff seems to always be disoriented and not caring. The ONLY amazing thing about this place is yes... their cheesecake. It really is worth 5 stars if I just went to get cheescake to go... which they should maket more than sitting down for a 30 dollar dinner... per person. I LOVE the apple streusel cheescake... it is to die for. And yes... obviously the cheescake is shiped in, but most deserts at resturants are, they just won't admit it. You can't taste it though. Wait Time... tick tick tick Dinner... ehh Service.... BLAHHH puke, Cheesecake... *changes underwear*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=200
Mike Z.,"Dallas, TX",386,155,4,2.0,4/20/2009,"I ate here 2 nights ago. I ended up meeting some of my family members that I have not seen in almost 16 years. I (like always) showed up 30min early and had a drink at the bar. I like how the bar is right next to the doors, so you can see everyone that walks in. And its an OK size bar area at that. Another plus, was they had Fat Tire on tap...which is always good in my book. I met up with the family and we still had to wait about 30-45 min for a table. When we got to our table, we sat and we all talked for a while. Our waiter came over very quickly and asked us for our drinks. Another Fat tire for me PLEASE. Well, it never came. I had to ask him a second time. This happened twice. So the service was not all that great. The food ...I had the Jamaican shrimp. Now, I like spicy food but this dish was just a tad bit to spicy for me. It was good just too much heat. I had to wash it down with Fat Tire...oh wait I didn't have one. RATS....but overall it was just OK. I have eaten at other CF in Vegas and the 2 in Dallas and this one was probably the worst one as far as service goes. The food is really the same at everyone. I would go back if I had to.  MZ  OH...and I did take 2 pieces of cheesecake home. I had the regular strawberry and i brought my wife the Carmel raspberry truffle. She really liked hers...but for some reason to me, theirs does not taste any better than any other that I've had. Maybe I guess I really don't eat it enough to remember whats good and whats not. Don't get me wrong...it was good, very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=200
Chris F.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,246,13,3.0,7/13/2006,"The portions are huge, and the food is decent, although you're always very aware you're at yet another chain restaurant trying to pass itself off as something classy. The pulled pork sandwich is OK, although I've had better pretty much everywhere I've ever had one, so I can't recommend it.  Avoid the mojitos as well; they're made with the cheater's method of mint simple syrup rather than muddled mint leaves, and the sprinkling of dried mint on top doesn't do much to convey authenticity. The salads are the big winner here.  For one person, get a appetizer portion, and take a small amount home, or get an entree portion, and have enough left over for another full meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=200
Michael F.,"Washington, DC",39,157,14,3.0,7/14/2006,"************UPDATE**************  I went here last with a party of 5 on a THURSDAY!!...it took exactly 1 hour 19 minutes for us to be seated..(i looked over the hostess's shoulder and saw how long our party had been waiting) Then once seated it took 1 hour 3 minutes for all of our entress to arrive EXCEPT the chicken marsala, which took about 10 more minutes.  After everyone got their food the manager came over to our table to apologize saying...""We are so sorry about that guys, We were taking our time on that and we apologize for that...""

What?!  I agree about the portions and salads...and about their fake classy atmosphere...the food is good...definetely eatable...but the cheesecake is their main draw (as you can tell) Doused with gerenrously thick whipped cream and very thick...delishigasmic.  But they do very good at is pulling off that their cheesecakes are freshly made...let me bust this myth...they aren't.  If they were they would be 10x better, but for the amout they dish out daily, its finacially and physically impossible even with the enourmous amount of staff and square footage they have...  Man i would love to be their manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=220

Brandon S.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",0,11,,2.0,9/22/2012,Been to this location twice. First time was great service all the way around. However the second visit not so much. Was promptly greeted and estimated time was given to be seated. No issue front door staff was superb. However once seated it took them 10 min to come to my table and take my drink order. A table to the right of me had 2 parents and 4 kids with them and were greeted within 1 min. Then my waitress came over to me. Totally unacceptable. I asked for a manager and explained the situation and he agreed. The first half of dinner the manager took my order for food and drink. The waitress hid and stayed away. The 2nd half of dinner she was more involved however did not visit table very often. They did let me have my drink for free. Needless to say this was a huge fail at this location for Cheesecake Factory.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=220
Louise D.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,,3.0,6/24/2012,Referencing my previous review (dis-satisfied/lousy service etc) I contacted the Cheesecake Factory online and sent them a synopsis of the events. I have to say the manager of the Soutlake location did send me an gift card and a letter of apology. I contacted the manager by telephone upon receipt and thanked her. She was very pleasant and said she hoped we would give the Southlake location another try but also wished us a great meal if we chose to use it at another location instead. This was a nice gesture and shows that the Cheesecake Factory genuinely are concerned about customer satisfaction albeit a little later than the actual event.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=220

Vincenzo K.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,157,12,2.0,8/22/2009,We were among the first 20 customers of this estab. when it opened in March of 2006. Not want to bitch about it but they did not even offer a complimentary soft drinks to any of the first customers who set foot there. Comp. soft drinks is a common tradition with many restaurants on their first hour of business. Is CF poor? Food is average. The simple to make bruschetta was a fake. I returned it.

Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",516,2583,7,3.0,1/12/2009,"Though the eclectic cuisine offered at Cheesecake factory tastes pretty good to me, not specializing gets minus points in my book.  All the offerings here just seem to get magnified by the faux haute atmosphere, but prices are definitely affordable.  Pizzas are solid and reliable here, but nothing too special.  Omelets are big and alright here too.  Pasta bolognese tastes like something from Italian-American cooking.  Basically, anything you get here will taste like something from another middle-class restaurant, and for convenience sake, that is a mighty fine thing.  Offering a wide array of American/other classics in one location with a fake reason to get dressed up gets a thumbs up.  Overall, this one is great for parties and a reason to feel nice, but the food isn't the culprit in this situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=220

HUGE portions -JFC how can you leave room for cheesecake with a sandwich as big as your face? Suggestion, pick out dessert first (DUH!) and split an entree -EZ.

Diane T.,"Denver, CO",44,583,3,3.0,3/6/2008,"The best thing about Cheesecake Factory is its lengthy menu so there is something for everyone.  I've only been to this location for lunch and I found it comparable to most other CFs I've been to in California and Washington.  The food is OK, but nothing to write home about (I recently had the fish tacos - the fish was overcooked therefore too dry).  I think CF is like other upscale chain restaurants when they first opened years ago in that they filled a niche.  Now there is so much competition from other types of restaurants (especially in Southlake) that I can't really see why one would choose to go there unless your dining party can't agree on anyplace else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-southlake?start=220
