Elle G.,"The Woodlands, TX",132,99,194,5.0,1/7/2018,"So many options!  There is something for everyone. Portions are generally large enough to share which is perfect for us.  Don't forget to leave room for dessert... again, lots of options.   Wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  A big factor for us.   Great location, with quick walking distance to mall, Cinemark movie theater and other shopping.  Can't ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands
Elena A.,"Harrisburg, PA",40,15,3,4.0,11/29/2017,"I have ALWAYS loved The Cheesecake Factory but I hardly ever get to go. Visiting with friends we decided to hit this spot after a day of shopping in a local village.  We were originally told our wait time would be about 20 or so minutes and 10 minutes later we were being called to sit down. YAY!  Our server was amazing...  Andrew, I think his name was...  he was kind and helpful and he even put up with our tired crazy silliness.  He joked right in with us.  Drinks were YUM. Food was YUM. Appetizers were YUM. Atmosphere was amazing. We just had an all around fantastic experience!  Thank you!!!!! Keep up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands
Amanda S.,"Houston, TX",118,2,,1.0,7/22/2017,"My husband and I came in to eat after an afternoon of shopping. It's also our anniversary and we wanted to have a nice dinner.  We were seated in a section and basically became the ""forgotten table"" of the section and received the worst service. I'm being generous giving one star--the one star is for the entrees ordered and the cheesecake. I am not one to give a negative review, but this visit warrants one. Things that went wrong: -Seating two people at a 4-top table when there were several other groups of 4 people that could have sat at the table -Staring at an open two-top table for a total of 20 minutes that we ended up being seated at -server taking a while to get our drink order  -server checking other tables but failing to check on my husband's drink (which was empty)FOUR times.  -Refilling his Dr. Pepper with sweet tea after being told he had a Dr. Pepper -Server being a little rude and asking ""if we were ready yet"" twice. Ask if we have any questions or if we are ready to order not ""Are you ready yet?"" ESPECIALLY when one of us has worked in the restaurant business. -Server seeming like she was in a huge rush to get us out of the restaurant yet being accommodating to the other tables in the section Next time, ADEQUATELY train servers to serve this section properly and train your hostesses to seat sections correctly. There's a possibility of returning but that possibility is very slim.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands
Jane I.,"The Woodlands, TX",345,352,826,4.0,6/12/2017,"While a gift certificate led me to its doors, the food (and its ample, generous portions) were what won me over. The ornamentation and decorations were over the top and even a little gaudy, but that was really where the negatives came to a screeching halt. Much like other Cheesecake Factory franchises, seating was ample and service was relaxed and unhurried at the early dinner hour we arrived. That's not to say we were ignored; our hostess and waitress were spot on throughout our meal to make sure we were well attended.  I ordered the fried shrimp and fries, expecting a standard boardwalk basket-sized meal. Instead, my husband and I both goggled at the site of a plate that took up half our two-seater table. Best of all, it was well done. The shrimp were fresh, well-battered, and piping hot while some fries even had residual oil bubbles, signifying their swim in the baptismal fryer only seconds ago.  There was enough of my meal to be enjoyed both at the restaurant and later for a second dinner at home, which was much appreciated in the age of tiny courses and big plates. Prices are surprisingly reasonable, considering the sheer volume of food on the plate, and the menu is straightforward, approachable American fare. With both the mall and Waterway within walkable distance, there are some great options for postprandial walks.  We unfortunately didn't have a chance to partake in the namesake dessert but with our first visit being so positive, I'd be happy to make a return visit in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands

Rachel L.,"Spring, TX",18,173,,4.0,6/17/2017,"Giant portions, good food, and great cheesecake.  I've probably been to this location two dozen times and the only times I have had poor service have been when the restaurant is slammed, which does happen all day Saturday and Sundays. But sometimes I have great service then, too. They probably have over 30 appetizers to choose from. Four different types of egg rolls, buffalo wings, quesadillas, samosas, fried mac n cheese balls, flatbreads, etc. They have 20 different pasta dishes, 10+ different sandwiches and burgers, fish, steak, salads. You get it. They have a lot to choose from, including their amazing cheesecake. My favorite is the Oreo Dream Extreme. There are plenty of seats inside and a covered patio outside for people watching.  It can be pricey but once you consider how much food you received you definitely get your money's worth. I would suggest splitting a small plate, entree and slice of cheesecake with your date and you will still take some food home probably.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands
Chan'tel G.,"Spring, TX",443,478,1366,5.0,10/6/2016,"I'm finally reviewing this amazing location and I smile at the thought of the burger I ate. I typically go for the pasta here but I  was hungry and wanted more of a bite. Oooh weeee...yasss. My soul was happy. So happy that I seriously only want to come to this location to order this burger again. I didn't even get fancy with it either. It's the Americana with no onion, medium well with a side of sweet potato fries. Oh, and the sweet potato fries were one of the best I've had period. The other place is at a restaurant in Dallas. Oh, I also ate a bite of my friend's choclate hazelnut cheesecake...yassss. You can't marry restaurants, huh? I've been through many, in many locations and I think I finally might have found the one.

Mary V.,"Spring, TX",106,416,182,4.0,2/20/2017,"A very gratifying luncheon experience, particularly since this was my first venture to The Cheesecake Factory. Bustling on a Sunday right around noon, I thought surely it would be difficult to snag a table, particularly with a toddler and a stroller with an infant in tow.  A five-minute wait was all it took:  high chair provided automatically and booster seat provided upon request. Service was gracious and accommodating.  Drinks were served quickly with our lunch order arriving shortly thereafter.  Advice:  if you are not a heavy lunch eater -- order from the Appetizer menu.  Even those portions are huge, but nothing compared to the regular meals. Tex-Mex Eggrolls were good (albeit slightly greasy) with a flavorful avocado/sour cream dip.  A big thumbs-up on the children's menu offerings:  good eats for the kids with and optional side of fresh fruit.  Fresh fruit it was:  small diced pineapple, sliced strawberries and blueberries.  Lucious! The cheesecake selection is, quite obviously, their signature line.  When I saw the consistency and presentation of the slice of cheesecake my son ordered, I knew why this was a favorite spot of his.  Definitely eat lightly if you want a slice of any of their cheesecake for dessert, that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands
Sarah B.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,5.0,12/31/2017,"I am skeptical of these types of franchises. However, the Cheesecake Factory has (for the most part) given me exceptional service at an affordable price. Just yesterday I went there and had such amazing service and food. John Beck made sure that we were taken care of, when it was obvious that the place was packed.

This is the second time my family and I have sat at the bar to avoid the wait time. I felt I need to give kotos to the bar tenders. There were only two of them working on a busy Saturday with a good twenty people in their area. I really appreciated how customer oriented they were. They both tag teamed and provided great service and apologize for any delays. There friendly warm smiles forgave any delays in service.

George W.,"Humble, TX",9,15,7,5.0,11/6/2017,"This place is incredible! Staff is always friendly & attentive. The food! OMG the food! My wife & I have been here at least 6 or 7 times & get something different every time. It's so good we're wanting to try a wide variety, but it's hard because the burgers are my weakness. Lets not forget about the cheesecake. The cheesecake is ""last meal"" worthy. My personal favorite has to be the Oreo cheesecake & the Reese's cheesecake. The price can get up there for 2 people if ordering apps, meals, & desserts, but it's so worth it. Also, don't go here if you're counting calories. This is a place you go if you're wanting a serious cheat meal. Even the salads are high in calories, but like I said, worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands
Reagan O.,"Houston, TX",58,13,19,1.0,10/1/2017,From the moment we walked in the door the experience was awful. This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and it was not pleasant. When we sat down our table was dirty as well as our silverware. We ordered fried cheese as our appetizer with a side of ranch & they forgot that.. then we ordered shrimp Alfredo for our meal and that was awful as well.. the shrimp was over cooked along with the pasta. We also asked the server before hand what shrimp would be better to order (grilled shrimp vs sautéed shrimp) and she recommended the sautéed which then came out horrible. We called a manager over and he was responsive but needless to say we will not be back. I was excited to try this place since I had never been and it was a waste of time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands

The menu is really diverse and their is a lot of choices to pick from. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The food came out pretty fast. We ordered a lunch special and a pasta. They  were both really good. We didn't get to try a cheesecake since we were so full since the food portions were so a pretty good size.

Melinda L.,"Houston, TX",790,66,21,3.0,7/24/2017,"They have a huge variety of course that everyone who has even eaten here knows. However, the quality is just that of a chain restaurant. I had the cobb salad. They chop up everything so fine that I can't tell how much I get as I dig through the mound of lettuce. The chicken is usually dry. I also got the chicken lettuce wraps in Mexican style since I have a gluten intolerance. They were not good at all. The flavors did not meld well and has a weird bitterness.

Rewa L.,"Humble, TX",87,59,118,1.0,10/16/2017,"Subpar  service! My aunt's preference to celebrate her 66th birthday and it was a downhill slippery slope. My coffee, when presented to me was cold and old. I asked for a fresh cup. Our waiter said no problem. However, what I didn't hear him mumble was that he would heat it up. He brought it back heated up. I ask for a fresh cup, and he explained it would be awhile, a bit later he brought me a ""fresh"" cup only it still had an old coffee taste to it. Moving on to dinner, our entrees where served and all was well. We ask for additional bread, which did not show up until half-way thru our entrees. Our waiter showed more interests to the parties all around us. I was never asked if I wanted a refill on my coffee or water. We did inform our waiter we where celebrating my aunt's 66th birthday, his reply was ""Uhhh Happy Birthday"". He turned from us and gathered other staffers to sing happy birthday to that table. Then, turn back to us and asked of we needed to-go containers. No offer of desert. For heavens sake, I would have thought he would at least offer for us to buy what the restaurant is named after. We paid our bill and tipped him 15% against our better judgement.  We met up with the manager at the Cheesecake display and informed her of our service.

Maria D.,"Lewisville, TX",0,40,6,1.0,4/22/2017,"The food was good, but they made a HUGE mistake.   Our daughter has an actual gluten allergy, so we were pretty excited to see that they had gluten free pasta for the kids.  We ordered all of our food, ate everything, and only after we were done did the server come and tell us he accidentally grabbed actual pasta, not the gluten free one.  He basically just said he screwed  up, but didnt even act apologetic or anything. He asked if she just wanted gliten free, or had an allergy.  Im not one that looks for free things, but I feel, at the least, her meal should have been taken off.... he did not handle it well at all.  To me, it just sounded like he assumed we were just being health nuts. Allergies should always be taken seriously.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands
Charles F.,"Spring, TX",1,3,18,5.0,10/24/2016,We had a fantastic night at the Cheesecake Factory. The bartender a young lady with blonde hair made the difference! She meticulously explained my options for a brownie ala mode and suggested instead a chocolate cake and added some custom features that made my anniversary dessert absolutely delectable. It's a shame that I do not recall her name but she went above and beyond and deserves recognition for making our night absolutely wonderful.  Other than that it was loud and packed as usual... 40 min wait so we ended up at the bar (we got lucky though ; ).

Christina B.,"Huntsville, TX",11,23,45,4.0,9/17/2017,The food is really good here. Everything we have ordered here has turned out to be delicious. My pet peeves would be that the menu is gigantic!! If you are an indecisive person it's going to take you an extremely long time to get through. Also when it's two people they tend to place you on the tiny row of tables. They are close together and you can hear and witness everyone's conversation. Today we had young girls busy taking selfies of themselves. The lighting really sucks as well. During the day not bad.

Bunny G.,"The Woodlands, TX",840,1160,3986,4.0,12/18/2015,My sister was in town and we couldn't decide where to eat. If this is your dilemma then Cheesecake Factory is the answer.  Conveniently located at the mall you can have the excuse that you'll walk off dessert afterwards. The wait on a Friday for lunch was 20 minutes. So if you're a couple go sit at the bar to avoid a long wait.  I'm sure due to the holidays it was extra crowded. A lunch menu is available with items such as soup and salad.  The portions are smaller and the soup is always delicious.   We all opted for soup and or salad or both.  The warm bread basket never disappoints.  The chopped salad was a winner.  Too full for dessert but maybe next time. Service was great.  Now off to do more Xmas shopping!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=20

It's just another commercialized chain! There's so many places to eat in the Woodlands/Houston area!! We came in for dinner to use a giftcard.  We had their sampler and wasn't impressed. Too fried, making my face super oily. No thanks. I wouldn't get this again....I used to love their southwest eggrolls, but it's too fried! Our waiter raved about the new salmon eggrolls. Not impressed. Can't even taste the salmon!  There's 4 different dips that come with it. The light green sauce is super spicy AFTER you swallow. At first it taste bland... I ordered off the skinnylicious menu for a Caesar salad. It was a HUGE plate! What's skinny about it? It's the dressing. Oh.

Hannah C.,"Upper Kirby, Houston, TX",502,58,22,3.0,1/4/2017,"Ordered the crunchy chicken lettuce wraps to leave room for our ulterior motive--getting cheesecake. The flavors were good, a light peanut sauce drizzle over the chicken with  fresh vegetables cradled by crisp lettuce. The two sauces it came with were more than enough, though a bit overwhelmingly sweet. However, preparation of this dish was lacking, as I soon realized the tacos were loaded with another secret ingredient--water. As much as I appreciate crisp lettuce, I also appreciate dry arms and sleeves. After learning from the first taco, I made sure to pour out the water before taking a bite with the last two.  Of course, the meal ended on a sweet note when our table shared the vanilla bean and the kahlua cheesecakes--decadent enough to satisfy any craving of rich dense cheesecake for a good stretch of time. The mousse-topped vanilla bean was a good balance to the denser Kahlua slice.

Troy M.,"Houston, TX",2,21,12,2.0,10/29/2016,"1st time to eat here (or any Cheesecake Factory). Our waitress was prompt to greet us, but was very quick to say she didn't know why they gave us a kids menu, they are only for 10 and under and that my youngest daughter could not order from it. Pretty bold considering she never asked how old my daughter was (she is 11).  I told her that we have never been prevented from using kids menus in the past and that my daughter doesn't eat large portions and prefers the kids menu choices. The waitress responds ""I don't make the rules"" and tells us the lunch specials are discounted and match the kids menu portion size, but reiterated she cannot have anything from the kids menu.  My daughter is a picky eater and so the only thing she could find she wanted on the adult menu (not offered in a lunch portion) was the eggs/ham/etc plate.   When the food came she had to ask for another bagel as hers was burned. The waitress did acknowledge that by apologizing and saying ""they never should have plated that"". The portions sizes are huge so of course my daughter ate only 20% of it and was full. I had the Louisiana Chicken & Pasta dish and it was absolutely fabulous (5 stars for the food).  When the waitress picked up our plates I pointed out the extreme food waste on my daughter's plate and mentioned again why the kids menu would have been a better choice. She double downed that she didn't make the rules she only follows them.  We had all ordered waters with our meal because we like to eat healthy and avoiding soda is a good way to offset the amount of sugar we were planning to have trying cheesecake slices for desert.  Unfortunately after the tiff over the children's menu I was regretting that we even stayed and ate so I didn't want to pad this waitress's tip anymore than I had to.  She still got close to 18% tip because I understand that may also go to other staff who had nothing to do with this.   I liked the atmosphere & my food was great, but the hard line policy that creates food waste and limited choices for my sweet 11yo presented with a little snarky attitude from our waitress sealed the deal on a lower score and us never returning to Cheesecake Factory.  The girls enjoyed Marble Slab for desert just up the mall.  PS: I'm sure this is completely unrelated but I'll post just in case it happens to anyone else here (which would then be something to investigate) - after I ate here for lunch I was a victim of credit card fraud on the card I used later that evening.

The sandwich too was also served on the same skinny bread that they put on the tables. Both sandwiches went back and the manager had them redone and didn't charge us.

We always have to wait over 40 minutes to get a table and even longer to get our food. In my mind I figured, it's really busy so I guess it's acceptable.  Went back again 2 days ago and it was EMPTY. There was probably less than 7 tables in the entire restaurant during lunch hour. Service STILL sucked!! It took 30 minutes to get bread and butter. The server told us it's baking right now but when we got our bread it was stale and cold not even a little bit warm how did it just come out of the oven?? Expect to take 2 hours lunches if you ever plan to come here whether it is busy or slow.  I will never come back to this location ever again.

It really irritates me that they don't take reservations and the wait times can be absolutely ridiculous. Some people end up waiting 2 1/2 hours for lunch! Their cheesecake is amazing I recommend the Adams yum! The covered patio is also very nice with the lights and music. The real reason for the 3 stars is their drinks. They are awful!!! They are very pretty, but you can tell they add water to them to dilute them. I had the Caribbean cooler today, which is basically a watered down strawberry Pina colada for $9.

Taylor T.,"Spring, TX",517,162,674,3.0,9/9/2015,"This place overwhelms me. No it's not because of any bad service or bad food. It's simply because this place is filled to the brim with people... constantly. Looking for a relaxing, quite meal? Then this is not the place for you! I've only been twice, and each time I've sat in the super small tiny tables that are about 2 inches from the guests next to you. Literally so close I could probably stick my finger in their food... yes that close. I usually can't enjoy myself at this restauraunt simply because it's loud, crowded, and there is constant movement happening everywhere. Now I can't speak for this place during brunch or lunch hour, but I can definitely say this is how it is on dinners, especially weekends. Their menu is HUGE. Everyone should be able to find a meal at this place. It usually takes my husband and I 30 minutes just to read over the whole thing, and figure out what we want. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed simply by how many options there are (not that it's a bad thing.) They have some really great appetizers, pastas, and burgers. Their portions are huge! (Think Olive Garden style.) My husband and I normally share an entree and still have room to spare. Of course they have an exquisite cheesecake selection (obviously), so that's a plus! And for those of you who just want to drop in or take a cheesecake to go, they have the separate dessert counter to order them separate from food/seating. Overall I think their flavors are mediocore, it's over crowded, and noisy. But damn they have good cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=40

Attention to detail is important. We went for a family lunch/dinner today and sat outside. The area was filthy all under tables. So much so that people kept going inside because of the trash and everything under tables. My dad even went to let a manager know. Not long after someone came out to sweep a few things here and there but it was still junky. Not one person followed up with us to acknowledge the error and how unacceptable the filth was.

Initially, everything was going smooth as we got seated and our waiter came to us to ask what we wanted to drink. We decided to order their famous Chicken Samosas as appetizers. For our main course, we ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and Spicy Chipotle Chicken. After our order was taken, things started to go downhill. We waited about 15 minutes and never received the sourdough and sweet multigrain bread that would normally come within 5 minutes of being seated. Our appetizers came and immediately after taking the first bite, we realized that the Samosas were full of salt. When we asked about the bread, we were told that they had ran out of bread and were waiting to get more. New people came and were seated next to us. They were served with bread immediately. Next, our food arrived, but the bread still didn't come. We had to request the food server (not our waiter) this time that we never received the bread and she said she would bring it. The bread ended up coming after the food had arrived.

Either Texas standards are lower (in this case MUCH lower) than California's when it cleanliness and sanitation OR the general manager is lazy. The floors were smeared SO thick of grease and stick that it was evident they hadn't had a proper clean (and I don't mean mopped with greasy mop and blank water) in a long time. The display for the cakes was full of fingerprints not just on the outside but on the inside of the glass  so gross. The bathrooms. Ew ew. Same disgusting floor situation- used toilet paper on ground, the trash can in the handicap was a broken rusty larger can that was overflowing. The gunk build  up at the sink can only happen if it's not cleaned often and by often I mean at least once a week.

The hostesses, the wait staff, the service, the decorations, the food and the cheesecake were all absolutely perfect and I couldn't of asked for more. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, and I left with it being my favorite restaurant, hands down forever. The Chicken Bellagio was to die for and my Kahlua Chocolate Cheesecake was scrumtrulescent to the max.

The salmon was cooked just right and seasoned proportionally. The mash potatoes were on point. We both ordered martinis he had the apple caramel and I had the strawberry.

We had some errands to run, so I kinda killed two birds with one stone. Anywho, despite the amount of people in and around the area- there was no wait. So I was happy about that (I was starving). We were immediately seated in a booth, and our waiter came shortly after. I ordered their house side salad as an appetizer, and I must say their house vinaigrette is one of the BEST I've had (next to La Madeline's raspberry vinaigrette)! It was seasoned but not overwhelming. I practically scraped the plate. :D We were also served fresh warm bread to go with the salad. I love their wheat bread which reminds me of the same type of bread that Outback serves- delish! Our entrees consisted of the popular chicken Madeira and the gluten free angel hair shrimp pasta. I can see why the chicken Madeira is popular because it has a mixture of flavors. My husband really like his pasta as well. He said the shrimp had a buttery taste to them, and they were large. Honestly, there were so many things to choose from, it was hard to decide! They had meals to fit anyone's taste buds, ranging from Tex Mex, to comfort food or Italian. There were even ""light choices"" in case you wanted to indulge in the sweets (wink). Lastly, of course I had dessert, but that had to be on the go- I was stuffed. I truly couldn't even finish my meal because of such large portions. I was even able to share some with my husband. Needless to say, I would definitely return.

We should have suspected that the meal menu wouldn't be to good, because it's huge. You know how when you go to a buffet that has too much stuff on it? Most of it isn't very good because they don't focus one kind of dish. This is true of Cheesecake Factory. They have a huge menu. I've heard the burgers are good (after we ate there), but we ordered some Italian food. It was probably the worst pasta I have ever eaten.

Grace B.,"Houston, TX",5,25,36,4.0,10/28/2014,"My dad and I have never eaten at The Cheesecake Factory, but we've always heard about. So one day, during a trip to the Woodlands Mall, we went on a spontaneous food date to the Cheesecake Factory.  The wait wasn't long, and the service was pretty nice. They offered free bread as we waited for our food, and although it didn't look appetizing it was certainly delicious. I guess brown bread with oats encrusted on the top, appears to look bland but it wasn't at all.  Our waiter Jacob was pleasant, and he was easy to talk to. We were able to have funny small conversations and he was flexible and patient with us.  Onto the food, I had an herb crusted Salmon and my dad had ""The Everything Pizza"". My salmon was AWESOME! It was served on top of delicious mashed potatoes with a creamy but twisty-tangy sauce. The sauce is to die for! I don't know how to describe it, but it had an slight  citrus lemon sour taste. I'm guessing they used Greek yogurt? I also believe they used farm raised Salmon, since the fish was a light pink instead of a rich deep pink.  The ""everything"" pizza, had a nice crust and it was also delicious. The only thing I would have preferred was the order without kalamata olives. (DISCLAIMER: the Cheesecake Factory gives you the option of having olives or not) My dad wanted olives on it, which wasn't the best idea because the olives made the pizza even more saltier than it already was. The crust was pretty amazing though, to make up for the saltiness. I wasn't as crazy about the pizza as my salmon. I can imagine the margherita pizza to be waaaaay better. I also wish we were seated some where more private. We were pretty close to another party next to us. It kind of felt like a community table. The place was kind of noisy, but we could deal with it.  I would give this place an overall score of 4.5 out of 5. Mainly because of the pizza and the privacy of the tables.  I wish we were able to try a cheesecake!!! The lunch portions were soooo big, we didn't have enough room in our tummies to stuff a cheesecake down.

We started with blueberry mojitos because... Hello, summer. We munched on the free basket of warm delicious honey oat bread. For an appetizer we ordered the avocado egg rolls. They were pretty tasty, the dipping sauce makes them awesome. It's like a honey cilantro vinegar sauce? For an entree I ordered the summer rolls because I wasn't too hungry. They were actually okay... A little skinny could've used a little more ""stuffing"" but not bad! The others ordered a Mexican salad and a steak Diane. I did not try but they both said they enjoyed their dinner as well.  Morale of the story. This place has a VERY extensive menu. Basically like reading a novel.

I think we got a new guy who wasn't very familiar with the menu or the prices. The food was average. Everyone seemed happy with their meal. I probably wont go back for a meal just because the food wasn't anything special. With so much variety it is hard to perfect a type. What they have perfected is the dessert!!

Amber C.,"Spring, TX",14,24,,2.0,1/20/2015,"After my disappointing experience at lunch today I feel as I need to review this restaurant. Normally I would give this restaurant at least 3 1/2 stars. The food is usually fairly good - not excellent - but good and the service is usually fairly okay as well. Enough that I return from time to time to enjoy the skinny chicken enchiladas which prior to today have always come out hot and delicious. HOWEVER, it may be a long while before I return to this location. Today, we were attended to by a server with zero energy or personality. No smile - just rote, monotone service. Okay, whatever, I don't need to be entertained anyway but it is nice to have a pleasant server. The disappointing part was that while my husbands shepherds pie came out piping hot and tasted delicious (to be fair), my skinny chicken enchiladas were barely lukewarm. We brought it to the attention of the server who took it back to the kitchen to take care of it. The manager shortly came out and stated that they were remaking them right away. Great - I'm hungry. Anyway, I had the pleasure of watching my husband enjoy his entire portion of shepherds pie before my food returned. It was very hot and good but by then I was pretty full of bread and veggies so only was able to really eat a little of the enchiladas. When the manager followed up to ask how it was my husband reminded him that although it was much better, it still came out very late. The manager simply apologized again lol. He offered no discount - nothing- not even a free dessert or something. Most restaurants won't even make you pay for the meal in a case like this. I hope they weren't waiting for me to ask for them to take it off because if I have to ask, then this is not a restaurant I will continue to waste my money and time with. Next time I will vote with my wallet and choose a different location to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=120

I cut into the steak and it was again well done, someone else brought out a plate of mashed potatoes shortly after and i asked them just to take my meal off my ticket, they obviously can't cook steak. I could not find my waiter for 20 minutes during all this also. We finally got the check and someone brings out a whole new dish plate with everything on it!

It might just come down to the fact that it was really loud. I know that Cheesecakes are usually on the loud side, but this restaurant was especially bad. Seemed like everyone was having a birthday and getting sung to for it. This was actually my birthday too but the dh was told in no uncertain terms that he would find himself walking home if he even thought about it. ;) Anyways, the service was good. We only had to wait 10 minutes and there were open seats at the bar. Although I felt for the bartender because it was just her for the entire (and packed) restaurant. CF for pete's sake, get 2 people behind the bar! Our server was friendly, possibly too friendly and too in the weeds because he talked so fast that it was hard to keep up. He really seemed to enjoy his job though so I can't fault him for enthusiasm. He got our orders perfect as well. Everything was very efficient. Now for the food: that's why you go there right? Anyways, so I've been craving french fries and saw them on someone else's table so I got them as an appetizer ... very unoriginal I know, so sue me! They were seriously the best fries I've had in a long time and they came in what seemed like a never-ending bowl! They were served hot ... excellent! They were nice and crispy but not overcooked. No soggy fries here. And they were lightly salted. Let's just say that I filled up on fries so that by the time the food arrived I was already full! Oops! Good thing they make to-go boxes. For the main course I had the Romano chicken with pasta. I have to say that I've had better versions of this. There was waaaay too much sauce and the chicken was not well presented. When I had it for lunch the next day ... yes I did ... there were pieces of bacon on the underside of the chicken. It's a good thing that I'm not against eating pork. They should really clean the pans before cooking each food item. The dh had a pork chops and he said that they were okay. Not bad but not great. I tried something different for desert and got the cheesecake with strawberries. I didn't realize that the strawberries would be the glazed kind, so they were too artificial tasting for my preference. I'll stick to plain from now on. All in all, it was a good experience even though the food was only so-so. Then again those fries ... I'll be back for them!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=200

Our server was awesome, even though she lacked the enthusiasm, she still got the job done! We shared the steak diane and salmon. It came out pretty good, but it seems that we can never find a place that can make the steak at the temperature that we ask for. It always comes out one degree higher. (We asked for medium rare, it came out medium). We also had the ahi capracio (pardon my spelling), and it was delicious! The only thing was that, it was definitely not fresh! Tuna is supposed to be red when raw but this was dark brown! The lights were dimmed down so you didn't have to think about what you were eating, just taste it! The brown bread is awesome too!

We proceeded to just have it boxed up because we were sitting there for almost an hour without eating dinner.  I'm really surprised a manager never got involved with the situation. Plus she kept disappearing for a long time that it was hard to get a hold of her. This is the last time I'm visiting cheese cake factory.

My two all time favorite dishes there, Jamaican black pepper shrimp served with black beans plantains, white rice AND the hibachi steak, cooked to perfection served with shitake mushrooms, onions, two fried asparagus & wasabi mash potatoes. Woowee, talk about mouth watering. The shrimp is loaded yummy carribean flavors and the steak is tender, succulent and has a touch of terriyaki sweetness to it.

They seemed a bit disorganized, and after a few minutes or slightly more acknowledged us and put down place setting, which to be honest a cloth napkin placed down on the bar top as a placemat seems rather insulting, just let me eat at the bar top and you can wipe it down after I'm done or better yet you should be any ways and not rely on the ""placemat"" to do the job for you. Mine was already nicely strawberry stained, really nothing that mattered too much to me.  We placed out orders in, I'd really only wanted to come here for dessert but after browsing the menu found I wanted a few light bites. The Zucchini and Sliders were the perfect amount of food to be split between me and my company. The chopped zucchini pieces were great not overly breaded. The sliders were a bit greasy, and the meat was charred to burnt around the edges, there was close to no grilled onions on them, though a note you could add cheese to them if you liked.  After the light bit of munchies, I finally awaited to place my order for my main reason, dessert. I think I went through about 2.5 glasses of water until finally someone asked me if there was something else I wanted. I kick myself because I could easily make a whole FRESH cheesecake of my own taste and liking from scratch at home for about what they charge for a slice, but eh everyone is entitled to be lazy. My dessert finally came, being sick I tasted nothing, Oii, and yet I so wanted nothing more than dessert, though my other half said it was good, his taste buds are questionable, haha!  The bartender had went on a banter when I got there about the amount of tipping was conducive to the quality of service, needless to say one I don't think you need to say that out loud and two don't provide less than stellar serive to the next patrons based on what your last guests tipped, just saying!

Albert N.,"The Woodlands, TX",218,293,118,1.0,11/17/2008,"We revisited for a child's birthday, and were met by impressively poor service.  (We'd been before, so we knew not to expect particularly good food, but the kids like the desserts, so off we went.) We parked and were seated immediately.  The friendly waiter gave us menus and took our drink orders. The waiter returned after about 10 minutes, and we ordered our salads and entrees.  Then we waited. The server came back 15 minutes or so later with one entree.  Then the salads and the other entree, all together.  So instead of a normal dining experience of salads followed by entrees, we had a table full of food. As you can imagine, this was not a good turn of events.  We wanted to tell our server, but at this point he was nowhere to be found, so we started eating and eventually snagged a manager who walked by. He seemingly couldn't be bothered by this, either.  We did mention to him that it was our child's birthday.  He said that if we ordered a dessert, they'd sing happy birthday, and put her name on the plate. I don't think I've ever found a restaurant so cheap that you have to order a child's birthday dessert before.  But now I've found one.  (And when it came out, of course her name wasn't on the plate.) Normally I'd tell a manager about this sort of mess, and see if he could make it right.  But here I couldn't locate a manager at this point, and we were more than ready to leave.  So I decided to tell Yelp instead. Folks, avoid this train wreck.  In short: It's Chili's-quality food marked up an extra 50%. Service is dreadful. Courses come out in random order. Management doesn't care. Birthday?  You're invited to buy a dessert. They're so crass and tacky that they sell advertising in their menu.

We had spinach artichoke dip, dynamite shrimp, fried calamari to start us off. All was great typical appetizer, would not say best in town, but not disappointing.

Barry C.,"Katy, TX",29,88,3,4.0,3/17/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is a typical chain food restaurant in my eyes. However, their salads are typically fresh, nice just way over sized. The Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad is my favorite. Full of fresh vegetables and the chicken is very nice while the tostada chip stays nice and crisp even though it is covered with black beans. Truly one of my favorites and a recommendation.  This location is always nice, I prefer to set at the back against the glass, seems to be a little quieter, due to the decor these locations are always noisy with the cold floors, high ceilings and expansive open space.  For the finale of course it was cheesecake. To me the cheesecakes are those of something you find in the frozen food isle of your nearest grocery store, however, each time I try and find a new one to try. This time was the cookie dough cheesecake. It was nice and creamy with more dough than most, which is my favorite part. Be warned the crust is chocolate graham cracker or Oreo, which is unique with this type of cake. The contrasting taste makes you you stop for a moment.  Server did not provide his name, but was excellent as serving in which earns them an extra star. Almost forgot the bread to start with is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=220
Michele B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",48,67,92,3.0,5/26/2009,"Typical of any Cheesecake factory on a Sunday afternoon. Busy with kids, families, strollers, shoppers and a few couples. The wait was moderate topping out at 20 minutes and our table of 8 was seated. The overwhelming menu (20 pages at least) had a few in our party scratching their heads with too many options but the food was satisfying, portions plenty, teas refilled in a timely manner and the Godiva cheesecake made my taste buds happy! A tad over priced for the quality but this is a safe bet as you know you'll find something for everyone with their abundant number of offerings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=220
Kittiya L.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,70,3,2.0,12/29/2008,"This review was based on my most recent experience at CF, when my friend and I ducked in for a quick drink on a late Sunday afternoon.   'Twas crowded, as any CF I've been to tends to be at any given hour, but we were able to find a perch for ourselves at the bar instantly.  There's not much to review: I sat in front of the two bartenders, who were courteous, friendly, and kept our water glasses full and checked in on us every so often.  I ordered their house Cabernet Sauvignon, which was fine; they gave us some complimentary warm bread (we had to wait a bit for these), which was generous; my friend ordered a tall and watery mojito which was attractive in presentation; we drank; we chatted; it was loud; TV screens flickered; then we paid and left.  I might add that I didn't eat not so much because I wasn't hungry, as because I didn't think the food particularly appetizing, nor the ingredients of admirable quality. So, though I have no specific complaints, the experience wasn't particularly pleasant (or unpleasant).  That being said, I am sure that I will patronize the establishment at some point again, but only when it's convenient.  CF has not been and probably will not be a choice destination for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=220
Allison L.,"Spring, TX",0,21,,3.0,1/5/2012,"meh. I think it's overpriced for what you get. The food is good but not fantastic. The service has always been good.

Chantal R.,"Houston, TX",134,16,,4.0,3/26/2010,"I've been to all 3 Cheececake Factories in the Houston area and this one has to be my favorite. They have more food choices on the menu then the other do and they are much more spacious. Its always busy here no matter when you come, but I would rather wait at this location because of the wait staff service. Every time I've gone I have had good waiters and experiences. I absolutely love the strawberry lemonade and they are the only ones that have the mango lemonade. Favorite Cheescake Factory so far!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=240
Lexx S.,"Spring, TX",1,5,,5.0,8/18/2009,"I love this place despite all the wait during the weekends. I usually get the Shrimp Scampi everytime come here. I've been to alot of different restaurants and ordered their shrimp scampi but nothing compare to The Cheescake Factory. It may cost about $20 but its all worth it. You really get what you paid for. Anyways, the atmosphere is just like every other cheesecake factroy, very typical. However the bar here is pretty huge. Oh yeah btw, their cheesecake is the best! Tiramisu ftw!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=240
Jason A.,"Menlo Park, CA",4,17,,1.0,1/3/2010,"STAY AWAY! I came here with my family for lunch and everything about this place stunk. We were a party of 10, which apparently was too much for our server to handle. When we were seated, no one had bread plates, and he didn't bring any until I asked him, which was about 15 minutes later after we had eaten the 1 basket that was brought out. Crumbs were everywhere. We kept waiting for our order to be taken, and it wasn't until my aunt had spoke loud enough for him to hear, that we were all ready to order, then he came over. He didn't seem like he wanted to be there. I ordered the Kobe burger and guess what- it was very dry and crumbled apart. It was greasy on the outside like they fried it up in a skillet; I ate about half of it. Apparently the salad that my aunt had ordered was good though, it was an asian style chicken salad. None of us even wanted dessert, which I guess is what their known for, but after having their meal I wasn't going to take a chance on dessert. Overall it was bad, bad service and food. Maybe since the server knew the gratuity was included in the bill, he didn't need to worry about paying much attention to our table. As far as the cooks go- wow how hard is it to GRILL a burger? I won't be going to one of these chain resteraunts again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=240

I've usually gone during lunch and it's nowhere near as crowded during that time so the service is quick and the staff is a pleasure to talk to. They have a wide variety of dishes so it shouldn't be too hard to find something you'll like, I always get something different every timeI go. They have 'skinny' dishes and drinks which is a big bonus. This place makes the best sour apple martinis hands down!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=180

Jane D.,"Spring, TX",2,8,,5.0,5/16/2015,"I have been here more times than I can remember and every time it has been great! Some times we have to wait, but the wait times are always reasonable. No matter how busy they are, servers are always attentive to your needs. The food arrives in very reasonable amounts of time, and if there is ever a problem, they work hard to remedy it ASAP! A manager will visit your table and personally apologize for any incorrect food. We have yet to try something on the menu we dislike, but our favorites are the miso salmon and the barbecue chicken ranch salad. For the appetizer, the fried mac and cheese is a chwat meal in itself, and the fried wontons are also very good. Drinks are great, and their iced green tea is like nowhere else, but very good! Each time we try a new cheesecake, and always make sure to go when the pumpkin and pumpkin pecan cheesecakes are available in the fall. They are AMAZING!

Sida B.,"Irvine, CA",58,129,689,3.0,9/19/2009,"I have a confession to make. Of all the chain restaurants that I frequently visit, I go to Cheesecake Factory the most. Mainly because I had a lot of good memories there, and the fact that their cheesecake (when prepared right, you'll see what I mean soon) is awesome! I also have certain favorite items on the menu, and they take reservations! So since I pretty much try to visit a CF at any city I'm in, I suggest to my best friend to go to the one near her house, located at the Woodlands Mall. I think to myself, ""what can possibly go wrong?""  Complementary BREAD and BUTTER            I LOVE PUMPERNICKEL bread. love it. I also love how they never fail to serve me as much bread as I want.  SPICY AHI TEMPURA ROLL         For the appetizer, my best friend recommends something she tried recently (after I got her hooked to CF when she went to visit me in California). We get it, and it's a bit spicy. I'm not a spicy fan, but the touch of spice in this dish really brings out the Ahi, so I enjoyed it very much. However, the sauce is too sweet and watery. I think I would've preferred a slightly thicker texture of dipping sauces, like sweet-n-sour. Also, the tempura batter wasn't too thick and didn't really match the spicy Ahi as well as it looked. Kinda bland and takes from the spicy Ahi itself.  PASTA CARBONARA            My roommate got it the last time I went to CF in Cali and lemme tell ya, this dish is unbelievably tasty. The intense amount of flavor (the ""Spaghettini with Smoked Bacon, Green Peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce"") is so rich and savory that I almost died and went to heaven the first time I tried it. My best friend and I split this dish, and she absolutely loved it. It is a bit heavy, but this is my guilty pleasure indulgence at Cheesecake. It's not one of my ""usuals"" but I do get it when I feel the need to just get some pasta and cheese in my tummy to satisfy a craving. The bacon stands out really well, even in it's little chunks of glory. So pasta and bacon lovers...this is your Kryptonite. :) 30-YR ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE                 It's ""Layers of Our Original Cheesecake, Fudge Cake and Chocolate Truffle Cream."" Pretty much that sums up what the cake was, and the rich texture really brings out the different layers. If you feel that the chocolate is too much, take your fork and whisk a little whip cream to blend it out. It's delicious to the max.  Since I absolutely love this place, why not a 4-star? Service. Not only was our waiter missing half the time (I had to have a different waiter refill our glasses and check on our pasta) but our waiter served our cheesecake HALF-MELTED. You heard me. If you've ever been to a cheesecake factory, they NEVER serve their infamous cheesecakes melted! It's almost like a taboo! So sorry CF...you're incompetent waiter kills a star for you :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=180
Rob H.,"Austin, TX",249,317,230,4.0,1/30/2011,"What can I say... it's The Cheesecake Factory. Consistent no matter where you go. We had and have always had good service at this one.

This was our first time to a Cheesecake Factory and our first place out since we moved to Texas. We were seated right away and we liked the ambiance. Our waiter was new but was nice and attentive.  The menu was gigantic! We had the crab rangoons for an app and they were just ok. I'm used the mixture inside being a little sweeter so I might not order these again. My fiancé had the pasta carbonara and I had the ahi tuna as my entree. They brought me the wrong entree and I guess it was entered incorrectly so we had to wait for mine to be made, but that was ok. It was soo delish. And of course we had to order cheesecake!! I had the white chocolate blueberry and my man had the dark chocolate raspberry. Both were great. When we received the bill the incorrect entree that was entered was also on our bill. We weren't bothered but was surprised at that moment that a manager didn't come to speak with us about the issues.
