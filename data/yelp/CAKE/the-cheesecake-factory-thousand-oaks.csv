Lene N.,"East Bay, CA",1432,853,4296,4.0,2/24/2016,"I may be a little bias when it comes to Cheesecake Factory because it was one of my first ""real jobs"" out of high school, grand opening the location in Pleasanton, CA- and at the time I thought Cheesecake Factory was the best thing ever created aside from sliced bread. Although CCF is a corporate chain and every store goes through the same extensive training on the food and how to provide exceptional customer service, not every location has the same customer service,  and the only thing that is constant is the food.  The CCF in The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks is truly hit or miss when it comes to the customer service. One day we can get someone that actually practices the training they were taught and one day we can get someone that probably shouldn't be working in the restaurant industry. Either way, this is the closest CCF to our home, so that is why continue to come here. I really enjoy this location because who doesn't enjoy a good meal including dessert after a great day of shopping? I enjoy sitting outside on their outdoor dinning area, indulging in a great piece of cheesecake. Sometimes sitting on one of the tables inside overlooking the mall entrance is fun, so you can people watch.  Almost always this place will have a minimum wait time of at least 30 minutes so be prepared.  My favorite all time dish has been the Chicken Piccata with a side of angel hair pasta. I've never been a fan of capers until this dish. Capers are like an olive and are sprinkled throughout this pasta dish. The chicken is slightly seared and perfectly seasoned. The pasta is al dente all the time. I love this dish!  For my cheesecake, the three that I love is the White Chocolate Truffle Raspberry, Tiramisu and the other is Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake. All are absolutely delish!   Cheesecake Factory makes a great date night spot without breaking the bank. Also the location is great with different seating options: indoor, outdoor or indoor along the mall. I would recommend CCF to everyone... The cheesecakes are amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=40
Randall D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,4.0,10/13/2017,We love the food BUT your beer selection sucks!  Please fix it.  Even your wait staff thinks it's horrible. And $5 for a bottle of beer. NO!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=40
Marina H.,"Camarillo, CA",1,50,23,2.0,3/10/2017,"Been a while since we've eaten at this particular location. Service was excellent, food was pretty awful. Avocado egg rolls.... always a hit with us, this time they were just ok. I had the chopped salad - it was just awful. Way too much dressing so all was wilted. The place was so packed & we were so hungry i ate 1/2 of it & left.  I'd normally complain but had a busy week & just wanted to get home.

Feras B.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",153,3,1,2.0,10/15/2017,We came in for lunch time and ordered 3 Peach Bellinis with our food which took some time to get. The first two my friend and I didn't taste any champagne at all it just tasted like a smoothie. Even wondered why I got I.D.ed for this. Then when the 3rd one came it finally tasted like how it should. I explained to one of the waitresses and she said she'd tell our server but no one came to address the problem and we ended up just leaving after paying the bill.

D B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,34,15,2.0,12/31/2017,"I am just putting up a review of the last two visits we have taken to this location December 18th and 30th, 2017. We waited over an hour for a table both times which was fine. They provide pagers and they extend into the mall.  You don't have to sit and wait in front of the restaurant.  It's the same as any Cheesecake Factory anywhere. The food choices, the ambiance, and service were all great. I don't know what happened at this location but the taste of the food these last two visits, one being just last night, were awful.  December 18th, 2017: My husband and I ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and I like the Skinny Factory Salad. Neither salad was that usual Cheesecake Factory plump hearty salad. It seemed like portions were less.  They were both lame and just didn't taste as fresh as they should have.  Last night December 30th, 2017: The food was really bad. My husband order the Jambalaya Pasta and I ate Chicken Madeira.  These two dishes were terrible. The jambalaya veggies and shrimp were overcooked and burnt.  The top of the dish was all black. There was very little pasta in the bottom of the dish.  It was dry tasting. My husband was hungry so he just ate it. Not good at all.  My chicken was burnt as well. I was eating charred chicken.  The mashed potatoes were not smashed enough.  Maybe these experiences are temporary and this location and can get it back eventually.  It was very busy both times but it's no excuse to serve food like this and for the price it shouldn't be substandard. I'm hoping a manager takes note of this review and can make improvements to the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=40
J.R W.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,56,19,3.0,6/13/2017,"We dropped in here for lunch, June 6. 2017. Our last experience here was forgettable. We entered the Restaurant to an empty hostess station, and mostly empty restaurant. After waiting for a while, I inquired from a food preparer if we seat ourselves, he said someone would be right with us. As I am just about to abandon my quest for lunch the hostess comes strolling up the isle with a handful of menus. She's in no rush, stopped by the menu table deposited the menus, and made sure they were all square and straight. She did a very good job, clearly this is where her talent lies. And, to no surprise she grabbed the same menus for us, she spent so much time straightening. Eventually, we were seated. Now things picked up dramatically from here. Andie B, is a poster child of how wait service should be. A five star rating for Andie. She knew the menu, helped with drink selection, made recommendations, and was very attentive without over doing it. Great job Andie! If some of Andie could be rubbed off on the dozy hostess I would give an extra star in my rating. Because of Andie, we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=40
Carol N.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,46,3,1.0,8/3/2016,"We get takeout from this location about every week because it's open late.  The service is sometimes great and sometimes bad. The food is usually fine, sometimes really good, but more often than not, it's just fine.  Today the service was ok but the food was TERRIBLE. Literally EVERY SINGLE shrimp in my $18.95 (plus tax and tip) was BURNED and rubbery.  The spicy chicken sandwich was bland because there was barely any sauce on it.  The food is expensive so I expect a LITTLE bit of care and some pride in the food they serve but our meal today was sloppy, substandard and a total waste of our money. We'll be making plans to avoid having this as our only dining option going forward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=40

I ordered just fettuccine alfredo. I called to tell them I was there and no one came out for about 20 minutes.

Carley H.,"Simi Valley, CA",49,10,,1.0,4/29/2017,"Well... the waitress and the food were fine, but the manager tonight was just not a suitable fit for the service industry.  Upon arrival, she snapped at my brother who had called the night before to tell the restaurant we would be coming with a large party for my niece's birthday, and to ask what the protocol was since they don't take reservations. My brother did exactly what the restaurant told him to do. He arrived early, at the time they asked, but upon arrival the manager snapped at my brother and argued and told him that she was going to make him wait 2 hours. Completely unprofessional. She must have realized she was out of line because she did apologize for her behavior.  However, when we left, my niece accidentally left one of her cards with a gift card at the table. We had been standing outside for now longer than 10 minutes before we realized. I went back in to ask about it and she went to the back and came out to say, ""No sorry. I have an honest staff, so it's probably in the trash."" Ummm, okay so go check. That's your job. If it's in the trash it will still be on top!  As a manager in a Cheesecake Factory, one of your biggest responsibilities is CUSTOMER SERVICE! The manager tonight needs some serious training in how not to be a jerk.  I understand it was my 11 year old niece that mistakenly left the card, but the excuse should not be, ""we're honest here and it's probably in the trash."" No bueno Cheesecake Factory, Thousand Oaks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=40

Elaina P.,"Oxnard, CA",111,30,66,3.0,5/24/2017,"For whatever reason Cheesecake Factory is always busy. Their food is not great, just good. Seems to be a standard choice for families and groups.  Their menu is PACKED. It has SO MANY options (American... Asian, Mexican, Italian... I suppose that the American way is to have it all) You think every item can't possibly be good. I suppose you'd have to try everything to know. Service is hit and miss. Really just depends when you go.  There is always a wait in the evenings to be seated. Usually quite a bit of a wait. Though they did just finish their outdoor patio area which adds a decedent amount of seating.  I will note the Lemon Garlic Shrimp with angel hair pasta is very tasty. Looks simple but the flavor is great and the shrimp are a good size (A bit pricey in my opinion for 5 shrimp, a few asparagus pieces and some angel hair pasta with sauce - I ordered it as take out for lunch and it was $19.25) Cheesecake options are endless... for sure my Achilles heel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=40

The atmosphere is always light and enjoyable. One down side is the parking being that it's at the mall, so at times it can be a pain to find parking. (But that's not a deal breaker) The customer service is out of this world. They always cater to my needs. My bf thinks I am a pain in the ass when it comes to ordering but they never seem to mind. They always cut my chicken littles in half and make them well done just like my request. That's my favorite meal there. I have eaten just about everything on the menu but yes the chicken littles are my goto. Some might say I am a creature of habit. The waiters/waitress are very knowledgeable about the wine they have as well and great at recommended which wine would go with the meal of your choosing.

My boyfriend and I came here for dessert and the Oreo Cheesecake is absolutely amazing. The service was a bit slow, and it may have bothered hungrier customers, but we were only there for dessert and it was a very busy time, so we didn't mind and gave them the benefit of the doubt. I'm mainly writing this review because our waiter, Patrick M, was absolutely amazing. He is hands-down the best waiter I've ever had serve me at any restaurant. He was very friendly and would check up on us several times (we were taking forever to decide on a dessert, so many great ones to choose from!), and when I saw another server walk by with a delicious looking cake, I asked Patrick to scope out which one it was, and he happily went to the other side of he restaurant to do so for me, and it ended up being that beautiful Oreo Cheesecake I enjoyed so much.

The version I kept finding has things that do not exist anymore which makes it hard to do an over the phone order pick up in store.  I had to make the guy wait a couple minutes on the phone while I scrambled to find another choice.  PLEASE funnel it to the top to update the online menu!

But this is the first time I have come to the Thousand Oaks Cheesecake Factory for a Father's Day brunch. We got here at 11:30 AM. To my great surprise, no problem getting a table. We chose to eat outside and got the table under lovely tree. Because it was Father's Day, I decided to go to heck with myself and ignore calories and potential health consequences of the meal. My wife and I decided to share the Bruleed French Toast and the Chorizo Avo Omelet. The French toast consisted of two large pieces of bread that were each about an inch thick. It came with syrup to put on it, but the syrup really wasn't needed. Even without the syrup, it was rich and sweet and incredibly delicious. By far the best French toast I've ever had. I came into the restaurant really hungry, and by the time I finished my half of the French toast, I could've quit eating for the rest of the day, it was that filling. The omelette was also really very tasty. However I was so stuffed from the French toast, I was barely able to eat half of my half of the omelette before I had to stop. I brought it home and will have it for breakfast tomorrow. Sitting on the outdoor patio when the weather is this perfect is an ideal way to have a brunch.

We were still stuck in HORRIBLE traffic in West Hills and decided to turn back in our 2.5 hour journey that lead us to the Cheesecake Factory in Thousand Oaks. I honestly haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory since high school before a Cirque du Soleil show but after reading a bunch of Yahoo! articles of ""EAT THIS NOT THAT"", I remember seeing the Cheesecake Factory as the ""NOT THAT."" Luckily, they offer a ""SkinnyLicious"" menu and I opted for White Chicken Chili. It was pretty good and the portions were plentiful. Also, the bread rolls they offer before we received our entrees were soft and fluffy!  One of the pros why I enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory was how late they opened till on Saturday night: 12am midnight :) I 'll be back for more and maybe try a skinny cheesecake if they offer it lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=200

Mandrew Q.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,35,,2.0,4/4/2015,"I want to preface this by saying that I've worked at Cheesecake Factory before, so I am well aware of their standards and what a server should be doing. First, the server.  Her name was Jessica and she greeted us with a half hearted attempt at a fake smile.  I can tell she was forcing it and either she was having a bad night, didn't want our company, or something. We ordered drinks.  She gave me an attitude (verbally groaning ""ugh"") when i politely called her back to order appetizers.   It was dead and far from busy, yet it took her 8-10 minutes to bring back our bar drinks (after I had to remind her that we ordered them to which she replied, ""oh yeah"").  She asked my friend if he wanted another drink, but not me, although my glass was less than 1/4 full.  As i've said before, I used to work for this company and they trained us about this.   The food was okay, but the tex mex rolls were crispy and not as soft as I was used to them being when I worked there which was what I was expecting.  The Louisiana chicken pasta also didn't have that same hint of spice as to what I was used to.   Overall, just another experience with a seemingly entitled, absent-minded, non-serving......""server"".  I really wouldn't have cared about the food not being what I expected if the experience was better. The short female host in the front  with glasses (how convenient that I forgot her name) was much more polite and chit chatted with us with genuine smiles and all.  Her attitude was customer service.  Jessica's was not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=200

Tonight our server, Joel, was absolutely amazing. He was that cool server with an awesome personality who does everything perfectly and comes around just enough times. This is also the first time our food was actually bomb and not drowning in oil. I had the herb encrusted salmon with mashed potatoes and spinach.

john a.,"Oxnard, CA",2,36,17,2.0,3/6/2016,"For a birthday dinner last night, the little girl decided she wanted the Cheesecake Factory rather than her usual Wood Ranch so off we go to TO. It's the typical wait at this location, 30-45 mins on a Saturday afternoon, so we got our pager & waited. We get seated & our takes our drink as well as our food order since we looked at the menu as we waited.   The bread & drinks took a lot longer than usual to arrive, about 10 minutes, usually we receive both in about 3-5 mins even on their busiest day. We get our food, miso salmon, grilled pork chop, & I got the bang bang chicken/shrimp. At first everything looked good I start eating & it's delicious. But as I start to poke around, I noticed that I got the chicken but no shrimp to be seen. I call the waiter over to let him know of the issue, he apologize, but didn't offer to have the dish sent back to be remade. I continue to eat my dish as I hate cold food then 10-13 minutes later, he comes back w/ a little bowl of the tiniest shrimp you'll ever see & I was about half way done w/ my cold food as I had to wait for the shrimp. The shrimp was not the shrimp that comes w/ the dish, it was just sauteed in oil & seasoning, not the normal Thai sauce. To add to insult, the shrimp was completely overcooked & still had shells I had to spit out.   At this point I was extremely disappointed, as everyone's dish came out perfectly & here I was looking like an idiot waiting for the worlds tiniest shrimps. Although the server was apologetic, in no way did he correct the issue the right way. I was expecting the entree to be discounted or at the least a free dessert, but no, he just rushed the check to us & shoved us on our way as if nothing happened. On top of the check taking again an unusually long time, I had 2 gift cards I wanted to use & even then he screwed that up by charging the card w/ the most credit first so I'm still stuck w/ 2 cards instead of 1. If I wanted to, I could make all the dishes that were served to us today, but we go out for the dining experience. The food & the waiter are part of that experience, & today, both of those failed.   We will most likely come back as this is the closest CF in 50 miles, but I just won't order ""complicated"" dishes in the future as today tainted my experience for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=200

Always clean and respectable, and well kept facilities. Neat little ""outside"" area both in the mall and actually outside.  Food- Great choices, we are a fan of the Hibachi steak. My friend described it as ""a party in her mouth and everyone is invited"" and that ""the delicate aroma of the steak, intermingled with the asparagus was comparable to a state of heaven for her tastebuds"". In summary, some good food choices. I tend to get the Pasta Da Vinci, which is always a good choice. Unfortunately a lot of the menu is fairly generic which is the main put off.  Staff and Service- Fast and polite, around Christmas they have a great deal- If you buy a giftcard you also get a ""Slice of heaven"" giftcard which allows you to choose a free piece of cheesecake.  Value- a little on the pricey side, but still good.

I called in the order and it was very easy and fast. The person I spoke to was very friendly and low and behold... unlike most restaurants that are as busy as The Cheesecake Factory is on a Saturday night, everything was correct, done when they said it would be and tasted great by the time he got home with it. We had Chicken tenders and fries, Chicken Marsala and an Old Fashioned Burger and fries. The food was still nice and warm when he arrived home. This morning my husband discovered that his wallet was missing... After retracing his steps, he realized that he had probably left it at The Cheesecake Factory counter when he picked up the food last night.  Normally, my husband and I do not carry a lot of cash - but he happened to have several hundred dollars and all of his credit cards in the wallet because he had just returned from traveling. Although it was 8:30am and I didn't think anyone would answer the call so early on a Sunday morning, it was answered by a manager named Jennifer who was VERY helpful. She said that they DID have the wallet and that he could come and pick it up right away although the restaurant wasn't open yet. He said she was helpful and friendly throughout the exchange and that he feels like going there more often just because of the service and attitudes of all of the employees that he came into contact with both last night (Nicole when he picked up the food) and today (Jennifer).

We ordered cocktails and our server was quite pleasant and helpful. However after we ordered dinner and more cocktails our server left for the evening and we were introduced to our new server Savannah. From the get go she was unpleasant and made us feel unwelcomed! What a sad difference from our previous server. We tried to make small talk and engage her but she was rude. I made a comment about my drink "" evaporating"" and that I would like to order another. She right away gave me a dirty look and so I told her who our DD was and that I was not driving. I again explained that we were going to a movie and I was not driving. She said nothing and walked away. Next thing I know she has the manager walk over my cocktail to see if I was ok. The manager was very professional and explained that this was my 4th cocktail in 2 hours and they would be liable if I fell or something. We chatted for a bit and he was satisfied that I was not drunk and gave me my cocktail. He also offered to extend the happy hour price for me. Savannah came back and was completely rude, dismissive and has no business working the bar area if she is going to pass judgement on people! If she had taken the time to chat and ask questions she would have been satisfied that we were not out of control. The icing on the cake is when we had a gentleman join us and all of a sudden she had a personality and actually chatted with him.

J.Steve I.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/24/2015,"Once again another terrible experience at the Thousand Oaks CheeseCake Factory. I swore tha last time I was mistreated there that I would never go back, but unfortunately my daughter and her fiancé had a gift card they wanted to take advantage of, and we were celebrating a belated birthday for my daughter.  The following was a comedy of errors and screw-ups that made for an extremely frustrating experience. To keep tis short and succinct I will simply list them. 1) specified to the hostess we wished to eat inside. (as it was blowing 20 knots outside) 2) when we finally were notified we had a table the first hostess could not find our res.  3) after the first hostess abandoned us, the second tried to lead us to a table outside! when we told her we had asked for a table inside, she told us it would be another 20 minute wait!  4) 40 minutes later, we are led to a bar booth barely big enough for 4. they stick a chair on the end of the table, in the middle of the aisle directly adjacent to the entrance to the bar area. (I might as well have been seated in the middle of the freeway. 5) wait forever to get 2 beers, while sitting 10 feet from the bar 6) when we finally get our drinks the waiter forgets straws, we ask for straws and then don't see him for another 15 minutes. Finally ask a passing waiter for some straws, he walks 10 feet away and gets the straws. 7) the table is cluttered with 5 services and I try to flag a waiter to clear some of the extraneous junk, and even after yelling at a passing waiter finally have to remove the stuff myself and dump it at a wait station. 8) our first order of starters arrive and because of the lack of space I have to get up and stand back so the waiter can serve.  9) I have never had this next one happen before.... A waiter comes to our table and asks us if they can bring our entrees to the table because they are up in the ""window"" (even though the starters have only been on the table a few minutes.) We figure we can stand that and agree. A moment later the entrees arrive and it becomes glaringly clear that there is not enough room at the table for all the plates. I am forced to stand up and step back again while the servers figure out the mess on our table. I want to point out that I have not ordered an entree. I remark to the waiter that if I had, where would I have put my plates? And further point out that 5 people should never be seated at a 4 place table! He mutters something about ""we do it all the time"" I am now furious. 10) some guy who does not identify himself, comes over and asks, "" Is there something I can help you with?"" I am so angry I can barely speak! Fortunately my future son-in-law calmly explains to him how poorly we have been treated. The ""manager?"" apologizes about 50 times but offers nothing more than to seat us somewhere else in the middle of our dinner!!!!!  This same guy trips over the back of my chair later and makes no remark...... I have lived in this valley for over 50 years. I used to play on the property that this restaurant occupies. When the mall was constructed and The Cheesecake Factory opened we thought we had hit the big time. Sadly, in my experience, it is run like a cafeteria, the only thing they care about is stuffing you in the joint and then making sure you get out as fast as you can. I do not recommend this place to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=380

Naomi H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",180,122,194,4.0,7/31/2012,"I come here maybe once a month as it's a nice spot to grab lunch or dinner with my friends or family. Since I find the portions at Cheesecake a little much, I tend to lean more on the small plates and snacks menu. I usually go for my Ahi Tartar that comes neatly stacked on cut up avocado with soy ginger sauce with sesame seeds sprinkled all over. It's a great item to have on it's own and if I'm hungry I order 2 items from the small plates menu, usually the shrimp summer rolls (both on the Skinnylicious menu!) or a flat bread pizza. You really can't go wrong with the small plates and snacks menu. You might as well mix it up since it has a bunch of great options, instead of paying $15 to $20 bucks for a ridiculously big meal that you end of taking home and just maybe throwing it out.  I believe the pricing at the Thousand Oaks location for the items mentioned above run  about $6 and there are many other yummy options to choose from: Stuffed Mushrooms, Beets with Goat Cheese Salad, Freshly baked flat bread pizzas (a total steal, its actually pretty big for an individual pizza!) So next time you Cheesecake it, load up on the inexpensive small plates and snacks menu (the SkinnyLicious menu is fantastic too!) and do it Tapas style!

Previous to my most recent visit, I have dined at this specific restaurant four or five times without any issues. My cousin and I met up for a dinner during the week. Since it wasn't a weekend, the wait was less than five minutes (yay!).  We were seated in the area near the kitchen which are ""booths"" only one person wide.   While waiting for our meal to come out, I thought I saw something crawling on the side of the wall.  It was hard to tell since the lighting is dim and the walls are dark, so we both disregarded it and continued to talk.  When our meals came out we had no complaints.  I had a chicken dish (I can't remember what).  Halfway through our meal we BOTH saw something crawling on the wall, but we were unable to kill it.  A few minutes later, a bug (which looked like a baby roach!) crawled across her bread plate!  She killed it with her napkin and we promptly called the manager.  He comped our meals and asked us if we wanted dessert (really?)! We were only halfway through eating...we tipped and left sans dessert because of how disgusted we were. I liked dining here previous to this experience.  The bug probably came from the dark paneled walls...but just seeing it crawl across a plate is a strong enough memory to keep me away from here for good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=420

The Cheesecake Factory is Thousand Oaks is BELOW normal Cheesecake Factory standards and below most roach coach standards. On a recent visit I observed a bus boy wipe a nearby table off and then proceeded to wipe the booth off as well. Then the bus boy took the same rag and re-wiped the top of the table off with it! Very disappointing. Throughout the meal the bus boys walked by with their rags with stunk with the smell of cleaner and bleach. I thought it was just myself who noticed this but it soon became a table topic as everyone was able to smell the odors.

Anna K.,"Los Angeles, CA",358,201,243,3.0,9/18/2011,"Came here for my dad's birthday lunch on a Sunday. It was very crowded and the line for seating was extremely long (on a Sunday afternoon? Very interesting). I was put down on the waitlist for 5 people, and the girl told me it would be around a 20-25 minute wait. It actually was more like a 2 minute wait, which was awesome for us!  We were seated promptly and given our bread and drinks very quickly. The sourdough bread at Cheesecake is always blah (especially compared to the sourdough I am used to eating at Boudin), but I always love me some good squaw bread. Yumm. Our server was insanely nice and friendly. He made us all feel really welcome and happy.  The reason I am giving this place a 3-star review is the food -- although (as always) large in size, colorful, and beautiful, it simply is not that exciting and delicious to a foodie that's used to scrumptious mom-and-pop restaurant food. We got buffalo wings with blue cheese dressing, 2 different salads, and 2 pasta dishes. They were all ok, but for what we got, definitely not worth the $90 price tag!!

Specifically asked the manager what the dimensions of the catering pans were and how many pans per entree, etc. I told him we were feeding 25 ppl and he assured me that the order we placed would feed up to 32 ppl. I then gave him the credit card information to run the order. When the order was being picked up the person helping us said he never ran the credit card. It's a corporate card so we had left it at the office. Had to call the office and give the card number again. Now we're running late for the lunch and by the time we got back and set everything up it was 15 minutes past the scheduled lunch time. We also realized then that in spite of the reassurances about the amount of food, we weren't going to have enough!! One of the entrees we ordered was fettuccine alfredo with chicken. It came in 2 small pans that were only filled an inch high even though the pans were over 3 inches high. There were maybe 10 pieces of chicken in each pan. The fettuccine dish alone cost $80!!!  I even called the manager back and told her we weren't going to have enough food and that the pans weren't even full and she just said we can order, pay for and then pick up more food.

Alex S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/12/2014,"My last visit to Cheesecake Factory in Thousand Oaks was the worst dining and service experience I have ever had. I mention Thousand Oaks because I frequent the Sherman Oaks location and have always had a good experience. I am a pretty understanding person and being that I work in the service industry, can relate;however, the only explanation I have is that I was discriminated against. This experience has forever changed my perception of the company and I will never return but I believe it's my duty to share it with you. After arriving and being informed of a ""15"" min wait time, I was seated after 1hr15min, only because I surfaced my concern as I witnessed 4-5 groups of all sizes that arrived after me get seated first. I even stood by the greeter after she told me I was next. After another 2 groups were seated I looked at the greeter and she said it was okay and assured me my table was being prepared. Another 2 groups were seated and the greeter tells me my she is sorry but my table was given away. I hope you can understand my frustration and dismay. I am a  male Hispanic with 2 female Hispanics, celebrating a birthday after work. We are well dressed and I can't find another reason or explanation. I don't think competence could have taken it this far.  Finally we were seated at a what seemed to be a remote location within the Resturant that was almost empty(4-5 empty tables). The server wasn't much better than the greeter( drinks were never refilled). Anyways, this experience has taken enough of my time but I truly hope others don't have to share this same experience, drive to Sherman Oaks. It's only 35-40 min away(without traffic) but if you are Hispanic, you might be saving time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=540
Rob G.,"Port Hueneme, CA",42,156,2,2.0,5/22/2008,"I won't reiterate the menu here, it's Cheesecake Factory. Food is average,  service is absolutely horrible. Staffed primarily by snotty teens from the area, unless you meet their visual standards then prepare to wait and be treated poorly. Since I'm a little on the bigger side, I think you can tell where this is going. The couple of times I've been to this location the food has been OK but it takes so long to get out to you, you start to wonder if it's even worth it (even on several slow weekdays my wife and I have been subject to excessively long waits), in addition we've had trouble with our servers being given too large an area to service and having to wait for far too long for drink/bread refills. Even the CHEESECAKE here isn't that great. Heresy, you might say, but I've had better, and more often.  My suggestion: try Sisley across the way, they (used to?) have a wicked italian saugage with fettucine, the staff is much friendlier and the wait far shorter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=540

So, I sent it back right away and didn't ask for a replacement.  Paul had ordered the garlic noodles without cheese and had to send his back because it came with the cheese.  He also mentioned that he didn't like how it tasted so he ordered the Kobe burger as a replacement.  My grilled cheese was actually burnt and gross.  The cheddar cheese was actually brown and did not taste like any type of cheddar I have ever had before.  Sigh....I only ate about four bites.   The manager came over and apologized profusely for the problems with our food which was nice.  I was too embarrassed to send the grilled cheese back too, I am not used to sending food back.  Everyone else liked their food so, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  (Although I have ordered this same thing at the Grove location before and it was good enough!). The desserts at the Cheesecake factory are awesome though.  I tried a few bites out of Paul's Godiva brownie ice cream sunday and out of my brother in law's peanut butter cookie dough  cheese cake and wow....they were both fantastic.  They also brought us a mini ice cream Sunday for a birthday celebration and that was good also.   Although my food stunk and Paul had to send his back the first time I had a nice time.  The outside patio area is decorated nicely and the waitstaff are quite friendly.  Everyone else that were with loved their food and the desserts are amazing.  Normally I would have given the Grove location a three star rating but for this location I am actually giving it a 1.5-2 star rating.  Hey, but the leftover pizza that I ate as soon as I got home from Buono was AWESOME!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=560

Karma L.,"Oxnard, CA",5,30,20,4.0,5/9/2011,"Ate here with my family (of 6) late afternoon early Saturday evening (4:50 pm) and the wait time was an average of 35-45min.  By 5:30 it was an hour!  We waited about 35 min. We sat in a booth and didn't have very much elbow room, so 2 stars there but for a very busy evening we didn't complain. 5 stars for our server Edward (also the bus boy) who was professional, upbeat & never let us see him sweat even though it was outrageously busy/slammed.  The staff seemed to help each other out which was wonderful to see. Drinks & bread served in 5 min. Appetizer: Hot Spinach & Cheese Dip 2 1/2 stars, we've had better...  It was a little bland & I wasn't crazy about the tortilla chips but my dad liked it. I had some type of Salmon dish in what tasted like a lemon-butter white wine sauce with capers & spinach plus angel hair pasta.  It was not on there usual menu.  I picked it at the very last minute & was not disappointed...absolutely delicious! 5 stars Mother-in-law had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta; Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded and Sautéed to a Crisp Golden Brown. Served with Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes and it usually comes with asparagus however she subbed for green beans .  She says she really enjoyed the dish & the lemon sauce was very tasty. 5 stars   Parents had the Salisbury Chopped Steak 3 3/4 stars...my mother mentioned the steak was a bit on the fatty side which she didn't care for but they both said it still had a good taste.   Father-in-law had the Jamaican Pepper Shrimp 3 stars (wasn't spicy enough for him) but enjoyed it over-all. Husband had the pepperoni pizza...ummm yeah (I won't nag about his choice =0P), he said it was ok & really liked my salmon.  2 1/2 stars  Dessert: Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake...looks rich but isn't!  Yum!  Decided to try this since a girlfriend of mine kept raving about it.  I really liked it (& I'm not huge on desserts) however every now & again I'll have a sweet tooth for a little something. 4 stars Cruising the mall is a great way to walk off all that food (LoL)!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=440

I've tried almost everything on their expansive menu and have never been disappointed. This time our small group ordered the Deep Fried Macaroni and Cheese as an appetizer and I cannot begin to tell you how sinfully delicious these are. Super creamy. Extremely Macaron-ey. And the sauce they come with is an excellent complement to this already fantastic starter. If I could have just eaten a few orders of these as my entree I would have, but then I would probably be 400 pounds in no time lol. As my main course I ordered the burrito which is always prepared with the freshest ingredients and comes out piping hot. Love it.

BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU MAY LOOSE A LOT OF BUSINESS!!!!        I have been to many different locations to eat at cheese cake factory, but I would have to say this one was THE WORST!!        Its inside the thousand oaks mall, and we were sat on the patio which is part of the mall, when asked to sit inside and we told them we didn't mind waiting they said no. Our waiter was VERY arrogant, and acted as if we shouldn't have had the right to eat there (I'm assuming because we didn't know we were going to be judged on appearance, we were dressed too casually for this servers taste) so he ignored us most of the time, didn't offer us more water when our glasses were empty or more  bread when the basket was empty. Probably because he was too busy waiting on the two women DIRECTLY NEXT TO US because they were dressed up, had a lot of shopping bags from the higher classed stores (not to be named) and so I guess he figured they deserved his 100% undivided attention. We were treated like dirt our whole visit, like we were trash off of the street.       When we COULD ACTUALLY get his attention, he was very snobbish with us, and RUDE BEYOND BELIEF!!!!          Not to mention, the food was not as high quality as I am used to having when visiting a Cheese Cake Factory restaurant. He didn't even offer us any desert, we had to ask for the desert menu AFTER he decided it was time to shoo us off my giving us the bill!!!!  The cheesecake that I ordered tasted as if it was DAYS OLD!! and I got sick that night. our bill came out to over 90$, and my husband being as generous and sweet as he is, still left a good tip. (bless his heart)      We WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I ADVISE YOU TO TURN AND RUN FROM THIS LOCATION UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE JUDGED BY YOUR APPEARANCE, AND WANT SHITTY SERVICE.!! *** I would recommend the location in TOPANGA or the location in SHERMAN OAKS.

RJ W.,"Camarillo, CA",0,56,,3.0,5/9/2013,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory last night to celebrate my daughter's 12th birthday. It was her choice and she wanted to sit in the ""mall area"". You can either sit in the restaurant, the outdoor patio or the seats that are in the mall. We mentioned the birthday to the hostess and she made sure that she got the details. Our server came over and immediately wished the kid a happy birthday. It was nice. Our drink order was immediately taken and the waitress handled it quickly. She also came back to take our dinner order but we were not quite ready. It seemed to take her a while to come back but they were busy. It was not absurdly long so I was OK with it. Once the orders went in, the food came out promptly. All three kids had different pasta dishes (two ordered off adult menu). My son's fettuccine Alfredo was SWIMMING in butter. I am sure it tasted OK, but I was not excited about his losing a year or two on the back end of his life. I had a burger. It was slightly cold. I was not in the mood to send anything back, so I ate it. Found out later the birthday girl's was cold also. The fries were lukewarm also. I am guessing the waitress would have taken care of it, but I did not say a word. It was my kids birthday, we were having fun and my beer was ice cold so I was willing to overlook. Because we were celebrating a birthday we got a complimentary sundae which was REALLY small. Don't count on that to share. We also ordered cheesecake (when in Rome, right?). My wife got original, son got Oreo Dream  something or other, and birthday girl got vanilla bean. Gave the sundae to the youngest. Cheesecake was amazing. The Oreo one was so rich my ten year old took home half. So 5 people (one off kid menu), one beer involved and 3 cheesecakes was 119 with tip. I didn't check but I suspect the cheesecake was a tad pricey, but it was my kids birthday. The family had fun, waitress was nice (don't know her name but I know she has a sister named Lauren who also works there). If burger and fries and pasta were warm it may have gotten a much higher grade..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=440

I have such fond memories of the food here but my latest experience has left me absolutely no desire to return ever...or at least not to this location. We ordered the chicken and biscuits which was advertised as sautéed chicken breasts with pan jus...what came out were 4 paper thin 2 inch x 2 inch slivers of dried out crispy (as in overcooked, not fried) pieces of chicken in a weird lemony flavored gravy. It was gross and so was the biscuit, which was also dry but strangely sweet. The entire dish had a really weird after taste and was sent back. Next up was a side of mac and cheese...usually pretty hard to mess up, unless you severely undercook the pasta and the sauce breaks...fail #2! This one sat uneaten at the edge of the table, seemingly unnoticed by the staff who never inquired as to why it was just sitting there across from us, uneaten. The third attempt was the chicken fettuccini with sundried tomatoes...this is probably thee most disgusting thing I've ever tasted...it had a really odd earthy sort of fishy flavor and despite only taking one tiny bite, I can't get that awful taste out of my mouth! After an hour and a half of sitting there waiting for something palatable to come out of the kitchen, only to be more and more disappointed each time, we finally asked for the check. Another 15 minutes went by while our server searched for the manager. The manager came over to offer us something else, just as the lights were being turned off around us.

The wontons were good, but the wrapper was really greasy. Orange chicken was on point though. Very delicious!  Honestly, I'd only come here for the bread they serve when you first sit down and the cheesecake if I could.

I didn't think there was anyway we would get a seat but we actually got seated fairly quickly considering how busy it was. Our waitress was fantastic and quick which was important since we were going to see a movie after dinner. All considering I was impressed enough to ask for the manager. His name was Massimo and was a complete gentleman.  I told him all Cheesecake Factory locations need to have managers as efficient as he is.

Bryce W.,"Simi Valley, CA",80,220,2,4.0,1/29/2013,"Let's do the compliment sandwich. The good: Cheesecake factory is nice because the food is always decent to good.  The bad: Unfortunately, there are a few downsides to this one. The wait on a Friday night is 40ish minutes. That's a long time if you're already hungry. Addtionally, you have to wait with people from Thousand Oaks. If you're not from Thousand Oaks, you understand what I mean. If you are, well... you're very nice, I'm sure, but your outfit is bad no matter how ""trendy"" it is.  The also good: The service at this particular Cheesecake Factory is fantastic. Our waiter was absolutely great. He seemed genuinely pleased to serve us. He was chatty, but not too much. He was attentive without being pushy/desperate. His service would be in the 90th percentile of what I've experienced in my life. We were very pleased. To recap: Good food. Annoying people you have to wait too long with. Great service. What this all means: I'll wait the extra 20 minutes to not leave really pissed off because I didn't have water for the last 30 minutes of my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=340

Meli. O.,"Oxnard, CA",4,47,18,3.0,2/22/2015,Always a pleasure but since we went on a Saturday afternoon the server was a bit overwhelmed with the volume of tables he had. We were sitted quickly on the patio and 2 of the 4 napkins had spots on them. The table and menu had grease  and the silverware was full of spots as if they were bunched together in a dishwasher. The drinks were holding us down until our fried cheese and warm bread came out. The entree I ordered was a cuban sandwich and me being from the Caribbean this was no where near Cuban. It didn't even come on cuban bread but some hard bread. It had melted cheese but was not placed on an iron press to toast the bread and flatten it down. The highlight of course was the red velvet cheesecake. God forbid if they got this wrong. For the price we pay for a dinner for a party of 3 with drinks it's becoming a bit overrated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=340

Niccole S.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,5,,3.0,3/14/2016,"If it wasn't for the manager Jonny, I would have given this place the lowest review. I recently became a Vegan and finding places that I can eat is a challenge. I wasn't sure if this Cheese Cake Factory location could help me. I asked a waiter if they could modify the classic Chinese Chicken Salad for me and he directed me to someone at bakery.     I asked the guy behind the desk named Kevin to help me with the modification of this salad and also to see if the price would change. Since the chicken would be the most expensive part of this dish. He said they could remove the chicken but not change the price. I arrived in the evening and this salad is $17.00 .  A little too expensive for some lettuce and dressing. His attitude was lousy and he had a ""don't care"" response. I decided to leave the restaurant.      As I was walking away very dis-satisfied with the service and the price, I decided to return to see if the manager could help me. I returned to Kevin and asked him if I could speak to the manager. He came out and I asked him the same question regarding the chicken and lower price. He said Yes they could change the price and he went to the back to speak to the kitchen manager for price difference.    I ended up getting the salad for much cheaper and same size as the dinner plate. If I would have left with the response from Kevin, I would not have gotten a better service and what I actually wanted.  This attentive and compassionate manager understood how hard it is to eat out being a Vegan and gave me exceptional service.    I left very happy but remembered I did not get the receipt from the cashier Lauren and she was just like Kevin, had a very poor customer service attitude. Why work directly with customers when you do not have good people skills. This place could be losing business to employees like this. Thank you for managers who care about customer service like Jonny to save the evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=340

Bar area would only be able to fit 1 big group or 2-3 groups of six max. I think the servers must have thought we were amateurs because we ended up with a happy hour feast. What we thought were going to be small plates ended up being 2 or 3x bigger. We ended up taking home several bags of take-out boxes home. Avocado rolls were good but very filling. I liked the spinach dip but the chips that came with it was really thick...not a fan. I didn't take any of my husband's sliders. They looked more like normal-sized burgers than sliders to me. For desert I had the tiramisu cheesecake which I thought was ok. My husband got the s'mores cheesecake which I took bites of, of course. It was delicious. Service was quite good at this location.

There goes trying something new.

We also ordered the grilled pear and blue cheese flatbread, which was excellent and highly recommend if you're more into vegetarian options. We started with the sweet cornbread patties (3 per appetizer) and they basically filled us up.  If you like sweet cornbread (with corn kernels), this is a great option.

Meals were free but the damage was done.  Finally our server appears and asks if we would like dessert. Wow, Really? I left a penny as a tip. I'm very forgiving and if our server had, as many in the past have done and probably will in the future, just said I'm sorry and then stepped up to the job at hand I would have been fine. Not sure if I can go back it was that bad but I probably will because it's the Cheesecake Factory.

Stacey P.,"Ventura, CA",17,157,65,4.0,4/6/2011,A friend and I got hungry after shopping at the mall and decided to come here for dinner one evening. It was the middle of the week but every time I've ever passed by this place it's been super crowded.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table when we were buzzed in. When we got to the front entrance we were told our table wasn't ready. We stood around for not a lot of time before we were finally seated.  I was already expecting it to be super loud since there were a lot of people so that I can't really blame the place for.  The menu has a huge variety of everything you can think of.  I finally decided on seafood- the crabcake sandwich with fries and it was very delicious and flavorful. My friend also really enjoyed her meal. We didn't see a lot of our waitresses but they were very friendly. At the end of our meal we both ordered slices of the Reeses Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake to go. Absolute heaven! The slices are huge so I shared with my husband.

The only thing I would recommend is getting there very early (5 o'clock) on weekends because it will have at least an hour wait.   I strongly recommend the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It is great if you like curry and coconut. It's not too spicy, but just spicy enough.  If you're looking for a lighter meal, the salads are excellent and the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps are really good. The Thai Chicken Pasta is also really good; it has a delicious peanut sauce on it.  Their Tropical Smoothie is really good too.  If you like cheesecake, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. They are constantly coming up with new flavors and have a list of about 20 different kinds. If you want to be traditional, go with the Strawberry cheesecake.

Richard K.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/10/2014,"I've been a Cheesecake Factory customer since it's beginnings in Beverly Hills... Back in the days of the big beefy ribs, salad bar and yes, even back then, lines out the door.    About 25 years ago, I settled on the Factory Burger as my ""go to"" meal and that was pretty much the only thing I ordered.  Last night, after being away for about a year, I returned to what I thought would be another satisfying meal... even if I had to wait 30-40 minutes.  Well, I was incredibly disappointed.  We had a party of 4, and although we were seated reasonably quick and the appetizer came out without incident, the main course (two burgers, a salad and an order of sliders took almost 40 minutes and came out at two separate times....and it wasn't even that busy.  To top it off, the meal itself was disappointing.  The burgers were blah, the chinese chicken salad was missing the dressing and was not at all what it used to be, the sliders lacked interest, and one waitress (not our main server) asked if one of our party wanted more coffee when it was clear there was a pot of water on the table and a tea bag in the cup.  Yes, the Manager came over to apologize when the Server discovered and reported to him that our food was extra slow in coming and only half had actually made it to the table... and he did ultimately make an accommodation for the poor service, but even so, after so many years doing the same thing over and over, this restaurant should have been running like a well oiled machine... and that includes the B team.  The only thing I can think of to create such a miserable meal is that the kitchen must have had the losers from Hell's Kitchen running the show because something was definitely wrong back there.  I never thought I'd be writing a negative review for TCF, but this was by far the worst experience I've had in over 25 years as a customer and has probably been the experience to put the nail in the coffin for future meals here.  There are just too many other choices in the area now to go back for another miserable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=520

Brandon S.,"Olympia, WA",243,479,258,4.0,12/27/2007,"I wanted to dislike The Cheesecake Factory something fierce.  Somehow I've avoided it for years and during that time I built up almost an animosity toward it.  It's the ultimate in overblown, overstuffed American chain restaurants and in my indie mind, it's evil.  But hey, a $50 gift card is a $50 gift card.  If it's free, who cares about evil.   But seriously, the food was delicious, I was pleasantly surprised starting with one of the greatest appetizers of all time - fried mac & cheese!  I've seen commercials for this dish at various other places and it excited me to no end.  Finally, I got to try it  and it was even better than I expected.  Best. Appetizer. Ever.  More bars need to serve fried mac & cheese.  It would be the best drunk food.  My entree was the Hibachi Steak - slices of steak with mushrooms, onions and a teriyaki sauce served with tempura aspargus and wasabi mashed potatoes.  Very tasty and cooked perfectly.  My only complaint was the mashed potatoes barely had any wasabi flavoring.   The wife had the Ranch House Burger - a burger topped with chunks of steak, bacon, mushrooms and cheese.  Mmm....Meaty!  It too was really good and cooked perfectly medium rare. There wasn't a chance in hell that we were going to be able to eat any more food, so we got a slice of Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake to go.  I love that they have a to go dish that keeps the whip cream and the cheesecake separate.  Do they have a separate Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake To Go Box Factory somewhere?  Service was good, seats were comfortable, cute kid in the window played peek-a-boo with me.  Overall, it was a solid meal and it only cost me a few bucks thanks to the wonder of the gift card.  Someday I'll actually have to come back and pay for my meal and see if I like it as much as when it's free.

In the realm of $20 Shrimp Scampi, I'd much rather drive out of my way to receive more than six pieces of shrimp for our $20.

Harris E.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",23,59,1,1.0,6/7/2017,"WOW!!!!! This was the worst birthday celebration attempt at a restaurant EVER!!!!!!!!!  My wife and I have been frequenting this location for over a decade now and she loves cheesecake factory - or I should say - ""loved"" until last night. My wife and our party had the worst birthday celebration experience! It is especially unfortunate that it was at our local location that we have been coming to for years!! We had a party of 7 and the night started off ok with pleasant introductory service, however that's where it all ended and went downhill from here;  A couple of entrees were incorrectly served, my order was sent to a different table and therefore I had to wait an additional 20 minutes while everyone else finished their food. I didn't blame the waitress as she was apologetic and did offer a comped appetizer. And after all that  long wait -  the shrimp bistro entrée was bitter and spoiled. I had about 3 spoonful's and just gave up! The waitress noticed and asked if I wanted something else but I was tired and didn't want to complain and wait again after a long day! The waitress finally came back and I had to ask for the dessert menu, but the straw that broke the camels back was when I explicitly told the server that it was my wife's birthday 3 different times during the night!!!!! After the painfully slow and unpleasant service; the waitress brought our desserts- quickly placing them on the table and then disappeared - bringing no clean plates or utensils. I had to flag down a different waiter for the clean plates after my party was waiting for over 10 minutes as the lit birthday candle was melting! Horrible!!! To make it worse - we were waiting for the customary birthday recognition from the staff, but no one showed! I expressed my dissatisfaction with the waitress and she just replied: its late at night and we are just all over the place, showing no concern or apology especially after I was significantly patient and courteous with her.  But that's not where it ends! I finally asked for the manager to rectify this horrendous experience for my wife and her party of guests.  Cameron  P. - was the most rudest, condescending and unapologetic manager I have ever met, especially being in the hospitality industry!  I explained to him of our issue! I had to express 3 times that we had a birthday celebration in our party and we were completely mistreated and dissatisfied with our reception for this supposed memorable experience. He showed no sympathy or apology stating that he was not aware  and simply stated that he will comp one desert. WOW!!! Really?!? I didn't even bring up my spoiled dish until now and he stated that ""if you ate it, then I have to charge you!""   WOWWWWWW!!!!!!!! I seriously asked if this is how he is going to end the experience ? His response: "" if you didn't like the service, you don't have to leave a tip!"" LMFAO!!!!!!!! REALLY!!!!!???????   Obviously he was severely uncompassionate about the principals of celebrations and memories!!!! But being the manager, if your employee dropped the ball - you are expected to pick it back up and maintain the brand! But guess what? It still didn't end there! To add insult to injury - a table in front of us had a birthday recognition from all the staff! I told the manager - but no sympathy, no apology! Just arrogant demeanor!  Thanks Management! You just made the franchise lose guests that have been coming to this local location for over a decade! You personally didn't ruin the night - but as a senior manager, you were responsible for the brand representation and rectification of the horrendous experience and unfortunate memory with our guests!

Rachelle B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,15,,1.0,11/23/2017,"Bought a cheesecake for Thanksgiving from here. Asked when we picked it up yesterday when to thaw it. He told us 4-6 hours in a fridge. So this morning I take the cheesecake out of the freezer and put it in the fridge to thaw. 7 hours later I pull it out and it's still partially frozen and the strawberries on top are mostly frozen. It's frustrating to pay so much money for cheesecake and have an employee give you the wrong information so you end up not having dessert to serve after Thanksgiving dinner. I guess I should have researched the info instead of asking the employe, I just assumed he would know. I looked up the info after I realized my cheesecake wasn't fully thawed and according to the website it says to allow  8-12 hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=60

Shirley H.,"Moorpark, CA",95,584,600,3.0,9/6/2015,"I came here with my hubs recently for a pre-birthday lunch and left somewhat satisfied. It was crazy busy on a Sunday afternoon of course, but I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly we were able to get a table. I also love the restaurants new way of getting a hold of you. The hosts used to give you pager type thing, where you weren't able to go within a certain amount of feet, or else it wouldn't work. But now, they ask for your cell number so they can text you when your table is ready.  Once we were seated, we had plenty of time to look at our menu and pick out the dishes we wanted. I knew my hubs would want the buffalo blasters for an appetizer and cheesecake for dessert, so I chose to get a side tossed salad. I used to LOVE their salad but was disappointed with the croutons. They used to season it which gave the salad the right amount of freshness and flavor without the salad dressing, but this time, my salad only came with a sliver of a crouton. When I asked for more, the waitress brought out a nice small dish full, but when I tasted it, I felt like I was biting into straight up oil! It actually ruined the salad. But the buffalo blast was greasy and delicious and so was the cheesecake my hubs ordered-apple crumb.  My hubs ordered the lunch portion of shepherds pie, which tasted bland to me, but my hubs seemed to like it. The portion it self was pretty big, which was nice for what you pay.  Overall, it was an okay meal and our server did a great job, even though she was slammed with other patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=60

Irene B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,9,,1.0,5/1/2017,"I have given this place two chances, and I am done.  No other cheesecake factory gives me this problem but Thousand Oaks. First time, they swiped my credit card TWICE and charged me double. I did not find out until my card statements came out and I did not even get an apology from the manager. Second time coming here, I called and ordered for curbside. (I have my receipt for proof and details) I wanted to treat my mom to her favorite food, so I ordered nachos with NO jalapeños and waited 45 MINS for simple nachos (it wasn't even busy) and then called again. (I was told it would only be 15 mins)  I was put on a five minute hold and then they told me my food was ready all along, and they will bring it out right away. (50 min wait now) I was already tight on time, hence me calling ahead and ordering.  Apparently ""right away"" means five+ more minutes. So I gave up and just went inside and got the food myself, without receiving any apologies. As if that wasn't enough, my nachos were cold and soggy and they put jalapeños in them, which my mom bit into and did not have water in the car.  It was late and we lived out of town so we skipped dinner that night.  For a pricey and formal looking place, your employees sure need more experience. And by the way, I work for Door Dash and often deliver from here. Your employees often forget to even put down the order, constantly mess up the order, and I end up having to wait even longer and deal with angry customers who think it is my fault.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=60

Cassandra M.,"Newbury Park, CA",61,49,21,1.0,12/12/2017,"Worst experience we didn't even stay to eat. We went to go and eat in the mall portion of this restaurant. Walking to your table you feel like you are walking on sawdust or peanuts... only it isn't a restaurant that does that, so when you look down it is actually crumbs of food. You get the leftovers from the many costumers, before you get to the table! Yum!  The first table we were going to sit at was already set but had not been wiped down, more leftovers! Second table looked clean and the floor had very little evidence of people missing their mouths. When I opened the menu I got a prize and not one you get in a cereal box...leftover bread crumbs from the previous consumer! Well I know I wanted bread, but this was just ridiculous. Some bird would have been extremely happy with the feast that lay on the clean plate and my lap. PLEASE tell Mary Poppins to feed the birds at the park! I had lost my appetite at this time but the people I was with were hungry, so I told them I wouldn't eat. If it couldn't get any worse, I noticed my spoon. It had some sort of whipped cream or creamy sauce on the spoon. Thank goodness I saw this before inserting someone else's DNA into my mouth, did they use mouth wash today...? I hope so! Again I wish the Cheesecake Factory would give me some fresh food that ""I"" ordered! We left after the spoon, we were not going to chance eating something we didn't order (crumbs, sauce on the spoon). If you like to live on the edge and see what kind of leftovers lands on your plate before ordering... GO FOR IT!  My suggestion bring your own silverware, look up the menu on your phone, pack a mini vacuum, vitamin c tablets, and a bucket in case you some how get sick from all the extra unwanted leftovers you are about to eat.

Again we complained 2nd time and said we did not feel comfortable with her serving us after complaining. Manager just told us not to worry about it.  Shows poor man agents skills. Can't expect good service if management does not care. She thought offering a free cheesecake makes up for it after a whole disaster lunch with numerous tables of complaints.  I don't care about a cheese cake you offered. I would have appreciated if she actually care about the customers.

I always sit at their bar, i love walking pass the mess of inexperienced gaggles of people in the front that stand around for 40 minutes for a table to open, then proceed to bitch about it... cute story idiots. My go-to is their Blackened chicken sandwich even though it is not on the menu anymore, if the right people are working you can still order it :) secret menu status. If i'm having dinner or I'm craving it, i will order the chicken and biscuits - that is literally one of my favorite dishes ever (last meal on earth type of s*#t). Every time i come to a Cheesecake Factory the customer service is great, food comes out on time and all together, you never have to be worried about looking around for service, the bar will ring up your drinks if you order them before happy hour ends (HH ends at 6PM), and everyone is always pleasant or at least faking it. Also, the outside remodeling looks amazing!!!! congrats guys!!! 2 things i absolutely HATE about this location: 1) the TV's are pathetic in the bar - what are you guys doing? they look like tube tv's that weigh 200 pounds from the 90's. 2) If you are walking near the kitchen entry to be seated in the back of the restaurant (to the left of the bar area) watch your step ...

Frank H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",15,3,,1.0,9/3/2017,"Ordered 1 simple meal and 2 Skinny appetizers and 4 cheesecakes for Curb pickup. Was told order would be ready in 20 minutes. Waited 20 minutes before starting the 10 minute drive. Called while at the curb. Told that bags were ready and would send them out. Waited another 20 minutes and asked if the order was ever going to be delivered to curbside. Told ""Let me check on that."" After 5+ minutes of listening to restaurant noise hung up and called again. Then told that the order was ready but since they were busy it would be a few minutes. After another 5+ minutes I called and stated that in 2 minutes I would drive off. Within the 2 minutes the order was delivered. Young lady delivering the bags noticed that one of the ordered cheesecakes was incorrect and she took it back inside to exchange along with credit card. In about 5 more minutes she delivers the correct cheesecake and credit card bill. First time in years in the tip area I wrote ""EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE"". When I got home, my niece checked the 4 cheesecakes. Only the cheesecake that was exchanged was correct. Niece took the incorrect cheesecakes back to the restaurant and spoke to the female manager. When my niece returned home with the correct cheesecakes she had NO KIND words about the manager. No apologies for the screw-ups.

Ordered chicken pasta for pick-up to drop off for someone working at the mall. Chicken pasta- ready for pick up in about 20 minutes. Great! Wrong. 30 minutes later they give me tacos. What? So I explain I ordered the pasta. The guy at the pick up window literally said to me, nope you ordered the tacos. Actually, no I ordered pasta. No apology no nothing-just ""so do you want them?""  In a snotty tone with rolled eyes. I'm not kidding. It gets even better. I had promised to bring cheesecake home so I went back and ordered 2 pieces to go. Well, when eating it, it was still frozen! So, for $40 I got frozen cheesecake and three tacos I didn't even order. I could have overlooked it if there would have been any level of customer service. So-hate to say it-love the factory but this location seriously lacks customer service.

I gotta preface this by saying I've worked as a server at Cheesecake Factory AND Rock Sugar. So I get it, I get it all. It's been years since I've worked for this company, and the food is still the best.  Everyone was great but there were a few things that really stood out and are worth mentioning. First was our busboy. I think he had blue eyes and a lite beard- he was gorgeous. He worked hard the entire night, lighting different heaters (which most people don't recognize is a pain) but his movement was just very graceful. He should be working at Mastro's. He even offered to box up my food for me, which I thought was a nice touch and a surprise. Never in my 4 years of working for that company did a busboy offer to box up food for one of my tables.  I mean, he really should be serving. Come to think of it, watching him, he probably was a server but just working a bus-boy shift for the night. I wish I would have found out his name, but if a manager is reading this, you'll know who I'm talking about. Also, I noticed another server from inside the restaurant came out to help with the heaters and I thought that was a surprise. If i recall the restaurant isn't a pooled house, so that was nice that he took time away from his work to help out.  If I wasn't out to dinner with my parents- I would have definitely got the name for my busboy crush.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=120

Javier J.,"Santa Barbara, CA",622,448,499,4.0,11/1/2014,"The first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory I must have been around 16 and ran into Miley Cyrus..Hannah Montana Miley Cyrus. For a few years after I made this my bread and butter. This was the spot to take a girl on a date in my teens, then something happened, I don't know what..and I stopped coming here all together. Well I made my comeback and it was just as good as I remember it! When I got there I requested side by side seating regardless of the wait. It didn't take longer than 10 minutes before I got the confirmation text (no more vibrating pagers).  Eh the hostesses weren't too friendly but they didn't come off as rude either, just indifferent. Smile a little more!    After being seated ""Matthew B."" introduced himself as our waiter. He was friendly enough and never left us waiting long for anything we asked for! Food: BREAD: They bring you a basket with sourdough and whole grain bread (at least that's what I think it is) it's the dark one in the picture. Honestly if you're into the whole sourdough thing cool but my my my how I love the whole grain one. It's got a taste of it's own that it leaves you wanting more and more and more and more.4.5/5 CAESAR SALAD: The caesar salad was good enough for a side salad. The size of it was the smallest one yet 2 people are easily able to eat from it. A lot of cheese which is good because it helped it stay balanced with the dressing. Lettuce quality was fresh for the most part. 3.5/5 AMERICANA BURGER W/BACON: Ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection! I really enjoyed my burger. The ""secret sauce"" added a good flavor to it..I added some bbq sauce to it too which went well with the whole bacon aspect of it. 4/5 FRIES: These fries were good. Nothing worth hyping up but a tad bit better than the fries that accompany a burger at any other chain restaurant. Their ranch is good so if that's you're dipping sauce you should be left satisfied with them. 3.5/5 CHICKEN PICCATA: The chicken was meh. A bit dry and needed to be more lemony. But the pasta was great! It was cooked well and the sauce and herbs came together nicely to give a satisfying taste. 3.5/5 Drinks: STRAWBERRY LEMONADE: It's the must thing to order if you don't plan on having alcohol in your system. It's a good strawberry lemonade. The sugar around the cup is always a good touch..if you are really trustworthy of the dishwashers of course! 4.5/5 Alcoholic Drinks: Don't judge me on the selections, I can drink ""manly"" drinks too..I promise. GEORGIA PEACH: This is one of the best frozen drinks that I have tasted in my life. It was really really really really good! Matthew recommended it and it didn't disappoint. The raspberry swirl gave it that edge that put it above average. Must order!! 5/5 MAI TAI: Ehh too sweet. That's all there is to say. Avoid it. 1/5 Dessert: CHEESECAKE WITH GLAZED STRAWBERRIES: It was good. The cheesecake wasn't extremely rich but it didn't taste like your average vons cheesecake either. There are sooooooooooo many options to choose from so I shouldn't have gone too conventional here but I did. Either way it was a solid dessert. 3.5/5 I like this place. It was 74$ for everything mentioned above. Which is more than fair considering their portions are big! I saw a lot bad reviews for their customer service which wasn't bad to me. You just have to be more wordy I suppose. They get busy so just let them know what you expect from the beginning and there shouldn't be a problem with your experience there. I'd say their service was okay overall though..definitely something to improve upon. I RECOMMEND picking booth seating regardless of the wait..it's just more intimate and it lets you feel like you're in your own private area.  Go to the Cheesecake Factory at least once if you never have. Their menu is full of options. I'm glad I came back. It was kind of like when you see that ex after a few years and you realize how hot she is and hit yourself on the head for letting her go. I'll definitely try to integrate The Cheesecake Factory more into my restaurant rotation. Even more so now because I'm sure Miley Cyrus is past Cheesecake Factory's..which is good..means better odds that licking that sugar off the strawberry lemonade cup is less dangerous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=100

Promptly returned and I wasn't ready (I know it's the CF but I'm eating differently these days) but circled back moments after I put the menu down  he did not try to upsell us on an app. Waiter was extremely attentive and communicative. Food came in a reasonable amount of time considering the amount of seats they turn. Food was good as always with a large chain that has an established successful uniformity. We had tickets to a show and due to the wait we had to box n go FAST. Our waiter was very helpful with that process as well. He was a waiter that took interest, continued to stay engaged and even tried to be humorous. He could definitely benefit from my extensive training and experience.  #frontofthehouse #waitstaff #waitertrainer #waitstaffmentor",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=80
River B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",134,18,8,1.0,7/15/2017,"Ok. Let me start with, I'm a server I understand kitchens and how restaurants work, I understand being understaffed and extremely busy, I sympathize with restaurant staff more then the average customer, but today... I came in and ordered a small Caesar(no chicken) and three mason jars of Caesar dressing, I asked how long would that be, because I was in a hurry, she said 5 minutes, great! No problem, after 15 minutes I asked her(Julie E) she said were putting dressing together it will be out soon, ok another 5-7 minutes I asked again, I get no apology just a annoyed look and a ""were getting it together now"" at this point I saw a manager, I tell him what's been going on, while I'm speaking miss Julie interrupts me and says ""we had to make more dressing from scratch that's why it's taking to long"" to which I reply ""I really would have appreciated being told that 15 minutes ago"" the manager apologized and I got my order within 5 minutes of talking to the manager. I was not offered maybe a free slice of cheesecake, a coupon for next time, absolutely no compensation for horrible service. I would also like to add that I saw two men standing around like deers in the headlights not helping, no smiles, not helping anyone. I hate leaving bad reviews but I was offended, also when I got home the croutons were so stale and my lettuce was wilted after waiting for 25 minutes. That manager should be EMBARRASSED, and that women Julie E should have to go through training again at the very least, teach her some manners. I won't be going to to this location anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=80

Informed the server and she was great took the plate away offered another fresh sandwich. I was in a lil rush so I declined. The manager John was great, said he was sorry again offered a replacement. I was hungry so I figured a salad would be quick. I was very happy with the service I received from my server and management.

Don't wait for when they begin to confront fellow patrons before you suggest that it might be a good idea to call a cab. Food was under the heat lamp for way too long and was dried out and crunchy.

MZ M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,27,,5.0,5/30/2017,"Treated myself & my 2 kids to Cheesecake Factory tonight because My hubby has been out of town for a couple weeks and I hadn't take the kids to a nice meal at all, and I called ahead and there was no wait!  Now I have been here many times before and am always happy as the food is good quality for the price; and even though I always order either the miso salmon, jambalaya pasta, or strangely yummy meatloaf we enjoy the many choices.  Tonight though I strayed from my normal order and had the Shrimp Scampi & Herb Salmon Combo. I was hugely disappointed! the 3 Shrimp were ok and a nice size, but the salmon was tiny and totally overcooked (being a combo I expected smaller portions, but the salmon was so small and I think because of the size they seriously overcooked it) My kids enjoyed their food, but I was so disappointed that the salmon was not worth eating. I debate saying anything to the waitress, but did. Our waitress Savhanna was right away apologetic and offered to have another plate made, but I declined.  We ordered 2 desserts to go and while waiting someone I assume was a Manager came over to check on us about my food and said he would take care of it. I really appreciate that they tried to make every thing right for us, and even though I blame myself for straying from what I know I like. The Cheesecake Factory does what it should to take care of its customers. We will definitely be back!

I tried paying over the phone with my credit card but the employee  wouldn't take it, totally understandable. However, when I arrived after the estimated time they told me they would be ready they still weren't ready. I waited and waited and waited and the cheesecakes still weren't ready. Not sure when I had called way in advance? Anyway, I brought the cheesecake home to my family and I was so upset to see the sizes and quality of the cheesecake. Cheesecake Factory is known for the large sizes of cheesecake , however these were below average. On top of that, for all of the flavored of cheesecake we bought, the taste was mediocre.

Told the waiter again but this time I told him I did not want it or anything else since my husband was already done eating.

Meals came out separately, five minutes apart. I had the chicken mango avocado salad. Not good. My wife had the Cobb. There were two lettuce cores in it. She said it wasn't good.

Erika B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",147,36,15,2.0,8/1/2016,"The food was great this last time, but I can't say the same about the service provided by Danielle N. To start off, the patio was completely open because it was early on a Monday evening. However, the host tried to seat us right in between tables that were so close to other guests we might as well have been eating together. My friend requested politely to move just a table over to give us and the tables besides us a little more privacy since it was very slow and quiet. We got major attitude right away. Being in our early 20's, Danielle N immediately judged us rather than treating us kindly and providing decent service. She did nothing special to make us feel welcome or enjoy our dinner, not even a smile. Being a waitress myself, I know what good service is. This was piss poor. My friend asked that her salad that came with the entree to be boxed up to go when we ordered, but Danielle clearly didn't listen because she had the entire order boxed so my friend had to ask for a plate. Danielle didn't even recognize her mistake or apologize for it as she watched my friend move her entree from a box to a dine in plate... She also was extremely unprofessional and laughed when refilling our water glasses because of something a coworker had said. Have some class and compose yourself before walking over to a table. I've never left such a poor tip in my life, but I've also never had service like that. This review is to let Danielle N know I wasn't just a cheap college kid, I was a pissed off guest who should've been treated better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=160

Why promote the app if you're not going to want to use it because it is ""too difficult.""  The manager was not being helpful at all and the server just seemed like she didn't want to bother with the app. If I didn't make it a point for her to use it she would of shrugged it off and not cared for me to even try to use it!

I can confidently say this since my most recent visit was for Sunday brunch and was very satisfying.  I got the bruleed french toast, which was a definite winner. The only downside was the classic Cheesecake Factory portion size. These two huge slices of french bread were good, but with my lack of self-control, I finished the entire thing. The exterior was perfectly crunchy and the inside had a heavenly custardy interior.  My brother got breakfast potatoes on the side of his eggs and bacon and I'll have to agree with his assessment that they looked and tasted like they came straight out of a freezer bag and into the deep fryer.

Vatche K.,"Los Angeles, CA",143,64,116,4.0,2/24/2016,"Growing up I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to many cheesecake factories before and I am a fan of how big their menu is. It's almost endless! And I'm not just talking about their cheesecake menu. This cheesecake is conveniently located right at a corner of the Thousand Oaks mall. You can shop while you are waiting for a text for your table to be ready so I think that is pretty cool. The service at the place is very good and I really need to mention a waiter here that is probably one of the best waiters for Cheesecake Factory in general. His name is Joel and this guys knows the menu inside and out. My friend and I always ask for him to help us because not only he is so attentive he makes us laugh every time because he describes their specials and food and desserts in ways that he is on some food network showing off his masterpiece. He has been working their so long he said he not only has tried everything, but he literally knows every single ingredient in every item they have there.

There are so many available entree's you end up making a Sophie's Choice between 3-4 tempting plates before settling into your selections. There is always a nagging feeling that you may be missing out on something else you skipped over. I have always been partial to their Jambalaya. Always satisfying.

Chris K.,"Newbury Park, CA",1,13,1,2.0,9/27/2016,"The chef working today must be trying to quit or something because it's obvious they don't give a **** Let's see...burned crab cakes half the size of what they used to be without any chunks of crab like it used to have. The fried crab bites appetizer I had from Cheesecake Factory by my girlfriend down in Artesia the other day seriously had larger chucks of crab in it than these. Those were good, yet the actual crab cakes here were pretty tasteless and overcooked. The other dishes our party had included avocado toast. I guess that's still technically correct since they burned the ends off of it similar to the crab cakes. I'm told it was really good last time we were here, but even the toppings are different too. Last time it had watercress and this time it had arugula which was a big disappointment for the person who loved it last time. The Butter Roasted Carrots and Pecans were actually just steamed carrots without pecans. I guess they fixed it when asked at least though the carrots  were obviously still not roasted. The Shepherds pie was good, but smaller than before as well. I'm not too picky about food and I really hate complaining about it or trying to send anything back in a restaurant, but honestly I am probably going to go home and make some Costco crabcakes for myself right after this. All in all we were all inclined to believe the issue lies with the particular chef tonight since the food was good in the past so  we might be back to give it another shot, but damn it was abysmal this time.

When I get to the take out counter the first or second salad on the menu is the Chinese Salad. I tell the manager on duty what happened and she did nothing.

The corn tamalle cakes were great, just as ordered.  The fried mac n cheese balls were a total waste though - like most places, they fell short by overcooking the pasta.  It was barely a different texture than the hot cheese. Gross.  Also these mac n cheese balls were WAY too much cheese.  Taking one in half you could barely pick out the pasta visually.  It just looked like all melted cheese.  Fried coating was tasty though.  I ate 90% of one and got a to-go box for the other three.  :( Chocolate Mouse Cheesecake was good.  Rich flavor, but not too sweet.  the best part was the dark chocolate shavings on top.  When I finally got to those, they really made the flavor pop. They should have included more of those and maybe the whipped cream only on the side (on top it totally overpowered the chocolate shavings). Overal okay experience but the mac n cheese balls really turned me off and made me not want to ever have them again.  The rest of the food was good, but for the price, I am not sure how often I will come here.  Great service though!!

I said that was fine and Continued with my order. Get home and there's actually corn on his salad (which is good but puzzling after the phone warning I received) but there's barely anything on my Cobb. Chicken, a small amount of bacon, a crumble or 2 of blue cheese, and 0 egg! It was an extremely sad looking salad for $15. I fought with myself as to whether or not I was going to call and bring the issue to the staff's attention because it's not really my style but ultimately decided to because it's not right to pay $15 for a salad I was adding home ingredients to just to salvage it. I called and politely asked for the manager. Angela picked up the phone and what a breath of fresh air! I told her what happened with the salads and that I was disappointed with the meal I received. She offered to comp my whole meal! I told her that wasn't necessary as one of the salads was being enjoyed but she insisted. She even asked me to ask for her the next time I visit so she could introduce herself and apologize again. Seriously, most of the times that I've had an issue at this location it's either attitude or no ownership of the problem. But Angela took ownership right away and treated me like a valued customer.

Hannah W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",46,96,86,3.0,2/5/2014,"My girlfriend and I came here last night for a girls night and it was absolutely astonishing how horrible the customer service was.  We were sitting at our table for LITERALLY 20 minutes before we had to personally ask someone to take our drink orders. And it was pretty funny to us to watch not one, not two, but THREE servers in one section not realize for 20 minutes that we were just sitting there waiting to be served. - I don't care if that wasn't someone's section, you hop on helping a table no matter what, its MONEY.  After requesting our drink orders from a server I believe was named Jessica (who was very sweet and apologetic for noticing we were just sitting there not served. And this was after we asked for a manager), she was very attentive even though we weren't her assigned table. My friend and I wished we were her table because she was a lot nicer than the snob of a server we were dealt with.  The manager was great too, he made sure to get us our appetizer immediately and free of charge. I think my only main complaint besides waiting for 20 minutes before being noticed, was our server. It's funny because she was never once sympathetic that SHE was actually supposed to be our server and never noticed but she had the worst attitude of all time. She acted like it was a pitty to serve us and she really didn't want to. She was never once attentive to us, we had bus boys and other servers and the manager serving us and refilling our drinks before she could even think to get to doing that. Then after we ordered our cheesecake it took her ANOTHER 20 minutes flat to get us our check. Even after saying the cheesecake was all we wanted left, no coffee, no more drinks. A great server would have given us our check after that...but nope!  And it wasn't until she gave us our check that she finally said ""And I'm sorry for the mishap in the beginning"" in hopes that she would get a tip. HAHA!!!! I'm sorry, but I am a customer who highly praises exceptional customer service and I will definitely reward you for that. But she definitely didn't earn a cent extra of my money. So you can bet that I let her know that Servers Earn Tips.

Which would have been ok, but then we Waited and Waited, and another family got beeped, and they told THEM to wait against the same wall, and then another family 5 minutes later, and here we all were squished against the wall.   I watched a waitress count out menus and thought here we go, but then she put them back and walked aimlessly in another direction.  My mom was having a hard time standing there so long, we would have been better off waiting where we were on the benches.  Finally I went up to the front desk and said our number was called and we were told to wait over here in the hallway, and my mom is having a hard time standing over here so long! So they said oh sure we will seat you right now.  Jeez, you would think when they call and say your table is ready that your table would really be ready, not that you would be shuffled off to another waiting area.  Horrible.

Stan W.,"Simi Valley, CA",319,522,154,4.0,11/15/2011,"My experience at this Cheesecake Factory location is either a 3 or 4 star experience. Here are some disclaimers: *Yes, the wait is usually insanely long. *Yes, the seats and tables are a bit cramped. *Yes, the dining area inside the mall portion of the restaurant is a bit weird. *Now apply those constants into an expected dining experience at this location and review accordingly. Service can sometimes drag but I think it is because of how busy and congested the restaurant is. My experiences there have been consistently solid. Food is hot and delivered on time and there is some time to actually experience and taste an appetizer before you are bombarded with your main course. The portions are good here too. It never seems to fail that we have a to-go box to take with us at the end of our meals (whether we remember to grab out leftovers when we leave is another story). The menu is insanely huge. Almost too big. I've tried a number of items and I think my favorite is the crusted chicken romano (the chicken is so thin and crispy and really goes well with the light tomato sauce). Obviously this place has dessert. I must say the lack of pies is a bit unfortunate (wink, wink) but the selection of cheesecake is mind-bottling. Yes mind-bottling.  ""You know, when things get so crazy it gets yours thoughts all trapped like in a bottle"" - Blades of Glory I digress. I go for the carrot cheesecake while the wife goes for the Godiva cheesecake.

I recently came here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday night, and they continue to have that amazing customer service.  One of my favorite things about this particular location is the option to sit on the inside patio, outside patio, bar and regular dining.  It's no wonder this place is packed from open to close on the weekends and most weeknights.

I want to commend you again for your excellent service and food.  My wife and I decided to try your Sunday Brunch and found it excellent, I had the Monte Cristo Omelet, it was different but very tasty.  To start with, your hostess seated us promply, then the waitress extremely attentive.  Her name was Kristen S. and she is probably one of the finest and most efficient, waitresses I have ever seen, and with a personality plus, plus, attitude.  She is a seven star waitress.  Keep up the good food and the hiring and training and your restaurant will never have an equal.

Amanda C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",18,22,,4.0,1/8/2014,Yes this place is pretty pricey now however the portions of food are HUGE. I can usually get 2 meals out of it sometimes 3 depending on how hungry I am. The Pasta Da Vinci is still one of my favorite pasta dishes. It is so yummy and full of flavor. The special edition oreo dream extreme is absolutely incredible!! I have to say cheesecake factory has gotten REALLY REALLY cheap on the cheesecake and you can see that it is half cheesecake and half whipped cream however oreo dream extreme is not like this. I guess they only do that on some of them. Really too bad. The bread and butter that come with your dinner is always a hit and very very good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=300
Todd G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,15,,1.0,3/12/2015,"BEWARE of takeout service!  I do a lot business lunches and I dread coming here!  I've literally been here over 10 times and it NEVER fails that I have to wait forever and the order is always botched!  I've even went as far as to speak with the GM on one occasion after a complete fiasco with another previous order.  I get lunches everyday from all over and I very rarely run into these types of issues.  For a large, successful corporation already aware of these issues, it's really inexcusable to have such chronic and pervasive service issues.  To the GM, you really need to take drastic measures and get someone who can manage your takeout more effectively and efficiently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=300

Alyssa A.,"El Sobrante, CA",1,21,3,2.0,4/12/2015,Our waiter was super nice and the food came out quickly but they literally sat all the minorities in a corner on the side of the mall which was located inside the mall with all the passerbys gawking at your food. After an hour long wait. With 2 little ones under the age of 5. I'm definitely not one to pull the race card because it's not as common in the valley but jeez! It was no coincidence that the 3 parties they sat around us were the only other black families other than my own. Extremely disheartening.

Ben L.,"Glendora, CA",0,10,6,4.0,7/14/2015,My favorite here is chicken bellagio and bistro shrimp.  This branch has better taste than any other cheese cake factory...the pasta has right amount of sauce and the chicken is not to dry.  The service is ok but not the best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=300

First off the advertisement on the menus is off putting. The sauces lack flavor (I've never had a more watery and garlicy ranch dressing). I've ordered the grilled salmon twice and it has had this odd bitter flavor each time. Lastly, the customer service below par, you constantly feel rushed and a nuisance when asking for any extra condiments or drink refills. The desserts are delicious. I think the customer service could definitely be improved!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=300

abby b.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,52,,2.0,3/22/2016,"I have always loved the food at the Cheesecake Factory, but the service was so slow at our dinner tonight that we really couldn't enjoy the food.  It took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks (iced tea and water!) and at least 30 minutes for our entrees (pizza, salad and pasta - nothing fancy).  Each ""course"", we had to ask, ""Where is our food?  Where are our drinks? etc.  The server just kept telling us ""Happy hour is really busy.""  The final straw was when we heard him offer a free slice of cheesecake to the table next to us because of the long wait, but nothing was offered to us.

Why is there always a line for this place?  Other than the cheesecake, all the menu items are easily put together and not worth the price we pay.  Service is just ok.  Lemonade is $4.50.  The lemons must be shipped from Italy to explain that cost.  The Jambalaya is 1/2 cup chicken & 1/2 cup shrimp, some bell peppers, tomatoes and spice sitting on a bed of noodles.  Personally, I think Zatarain's boxed Jambalaya is better and for the same cost, I can feed 4 or 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-thousand-oaks?start=300

The other nit is that they are alway crowded at all their locations. They have a huge variety of options which is good.  Our waitress was a sweetheart. She was sweet enough to laugh at my unfunny jokes. Had to have dessert against my better judgement after a huge salad. The chocolate rasberry truffle was rich and good.
