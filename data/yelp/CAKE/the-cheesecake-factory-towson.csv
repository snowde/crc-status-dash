Erika H.,"Baltimore, MD",242,14,8,5.0,1/11/2018,"I've only been here twice now and my very first experience was amazing! Everything that I ordered tasted delicious . I ordered their strawberry lemonade, Korean fried cauliflower, fish and chips, I used sweet potato cut fries instead. Everything tasted fantastic and this is definitely a go to spot. Their prices are reasonable. For four people we paid $90. But the service & quality was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson
BC W.,"Converse, TX",9,5,2,1.0,12/19/2017,"I ordered Shepard's pie as you can see in the picture. The worst Shepard's pie ever. Felt like I'm eating a pile of grease. Very disappointing as this is a staple for Cheesecake Factory. Do not order here again ever.  The quality has drastically gone down. I will never eat here again. No coronary for me On a lighter note. I spoke to the manager  about my food. He was very gracious and apologized for the food and allowed me to order something else. I ordered an spinach, bacon omelette with toast instead.... the omelette was very good and I was happy. I appreciate the professionalism and the prompt action by the manager. Because of him we stayed and our experience was remediated. Thank you Mr. Manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson
Whitley D.,"Churchville, MD",160,151,1763,3.0,10/18/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory from the presentation of the restaurant to the wonderful food. Yes even though I love Cheesecake Factory this location has let me down twice. Since they don't offer reservations I have set up two parties at this location (meaning showed up 2 hours before the event) and they have always had an excuse when it's time for the area I waited for being available. So that's been a let down. The manager the second time comped some appetizers on the house but my guest were starving from the wait so many people were upset.  The food at this location is delicious! I have only experienced one issue before and it wasn't their fault. The service to get our food was average which was disappointing. The waitress we had wasn't the most personable person but we were all still nice with her. The appetizers came at a decent rate but our main entrees were all coming out at all different times. That was disappointing for the simple fact everyone was starving! Even though the food wasn't all on point one thing that truly was were the drinks! I ordered three and they were all pleasant!  Hopefully this location can get it together to get the 5 stars I know them to be!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson
Curtis S.,"Goose Creek, SC",14,66,65,3.0,12/19/2017,Its probably called the cheese cake factory for a reason. I had pancakes chicken and waffles and scrambled eggs with hollandaise sauce. It was ok didn't really leave a big impression in the tastebuds but I do like to be fair and try this place a couple more times to really have a just opinion about it. This experience I had here this time was mediocre at best. They did take a while to bring the food out and the syrup made my mouths dry. Idk it could have been me very I'm thinking having brunch here isn't he best idea to go with.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson
Jada C.,"Reisterstown, MD",156,304,2575,4.0,6/22/2017,"Fantastic visit, great customer service, slightly above average food. Visited this location w a large party after goddaughters graduation. We were given Abby & Kia to take our orders, etc.  They were extremely professional, nice and 100% accuracy w orders.  The appetizers came out at a good pace but the entrees dragged a little as far as reaching the table and there were major complaints about a few food items. Mainly the blandness of a few items and  $1 - $3 upcharge on other sides offered.  I must admit, I was a little shocked about the complaints ... Until I tasted my food. Collectively we ordered Nashville hot chicken nuggets, Lunch salmon fresh grilled salmon, Bacon bacon cheeseburger, Lunch fettuccini Alfredo w shrimp, Lunch soup, salad, and Chicken salad sandwich.

I requested that my eggs be cooked hard/well done, like I do EVERY time. We are regular customers, so I know exactly what I want and how I want it. He stated ""the consistency of eggs won't get hard.""  What eggs does he eat? Bill Nye the Egg Guy. Annoying! He poured a very weak Typhoon for $11.50 and failed to order my potatoes.

Maria V.,"Marriottsville, MD",248,710,50,5.0,4/25/2017,"I never have a bad experience here.  Despite the restaurant being corporate, they strive to train their employees to make each guest feel well taken care of like a regular customer. I recently went to the mall to exchange some make up at the Sephora.  I was starving and decided to sit at the bar for a quick bite to eat and a drink (or two). Joe C. took care of me and did a wonderful job.  He makes a mean margarita, and provided a nice, light, lunchtime banter with me as I sat and enjoyed my lunch. I ordered a glass of rose, a margarita, the Tex mex egg rolls, the Caesar salad, fried mac and cheese balls (to go), and fried chicken sliders (to go). Everyone from the food runners to the bussers were efficient, pleasant, and great.  I would go back next time I am at the Towson Town Center for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson

Dan H.,"Shrewsbury, PA",5,26,33,1.0,10/4/2017,"I'm giving two stars becouse this place was just that bad. The menu is huge, don't know the exact number but around 14 pages long. I ended up choosing the chicken crusted Romano ($17). While waiting on my food, i also had to wait on my drink to be refilled, for at least 5 to 10 minutes as many a waitress and waiter passed by it sat empty. Finally I had to stop a waitress passing by in order to get my drink refilled. This was a Tuesday night, with no wait to be seated mind you, so no legit reason for anything to be taking so long.  When our food arrived, my noodles where under cooked and the chicken.... well for $17, when you order what is essentially chicken parmesan, you picture a real piece of chicken and fully cooked noodles. The chicken was more of a McDonald's nugget style. Not real chicken, more like mashed meat, formed and shaped into a flat piece of meat with a crust on it. Not at all what $17 Should have gotten me. The drink I ordered was a long island iced tea. Which is 90% alcohol. Not this drink, 10% alcohol max. It was so watered down it tasted more along the lines of a soda than an alcoholic beverage, and they cost over $11 to boot. The service was extremely slow. Literraly over 10 minutes just for the waitress to get the check and bring it back. Unreal. End of story, I will NOT be coming back to this place ever again, and with so many other options nearby, why would anyone want to come here?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson
Charlie L.,"Baltimore, MD",156,98,176,3.0,12/19/2016,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory and with it comes some pro's and cons. The pros: -Location (within the Towson center Mall) -Busy area of towson The Cons: -Parking can be a hassle -Service Personally, I think the Cheesecake Factory has one major flaw that's universal to all it's branches; The fact that they try to cater to everyone! Their menu is like a book.  There's so many pages and so many items that it takes you 15 minutes just to look through.  It's impractical and actually makes it frustrating as a customer.  I think from a marketing standpoint, it's ridiculous. The other downfall of this particular location is probably service.  service is highly dependent on your server and since you're so close to the Towson Area, most of your servers tend to be young ""adults""/college kids.  With that said, you'll NEVER get the same consistency of service twice.  Some visits may be outstanding, while other times, can be just so-so. I'll admit, this is your typical cheesecake factory, nothing more and nothing less.  It's not outstanding, but it's good for a meal if you're around and want something that's not super expensive.  And, of course, the meal portions can feed 10.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson
Anonymous S.,"York, PA",0,24,,4.0,12/30/2017,"The hostesses were extremely friendly. The wait was longer than we were told, about 40 mins when they told us 20, but that's okay. Our waiter was John. He was so nice and very helpful with our questions. The food was good, I got a salad and it was huge. John always made sure we weren't low on water which was nice because some restaurants take forever to refill. The Cheesecake was still frozen :( which kind of ruined the greatness of the rest of the experience. But I would return to cheese cake factory",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson

Matthew U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2086,1447,650,3.0,11/6/2016,"I have to preface this with the fact that I did not dine in here.  I really only wanted a piece of cheesecake.  With that being said, I was on a mission and right before I left here I thought I would stop in quickly and be on my way.  That turned out to be a fiasco. I walked in and walked right up to the cheesecake counter and looked at the cheesecake menu.  (Man, that's too many cheesecakes in one sentence) After looking at the menu I had to wait several minutes to be noticed standing there.  Once I was noticed, I was ignored.  Finally I was asked what I wanted and then told it would be several minutes to get it because of the orders from the people dining in.   When I did finally get my order I was happy to finally pay and get out of there.  If looks could have killed in here, I probably wouldn't have been walking out.  The person cutting and serving the cheesecake did not look like she was in a happy place.  In fact it looked as if she was in her own personal hell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson
Brandon S.,"Essex, MD",26,157,153,3.0,10/13/2017,"Not many things could be said of Cheesecake Factory negatively. It's reputation of a upscale comfort food establishment is true. However, I must dissect this Towson location and even comment on a few issues controlled by corporate. The location is nice and most importantly clean. However, I don't understand the decor. It's quite confusing and kinda reminds me of an Indian restaurant. The food prices are not super pricey, but certainly not the most affordable. The food came hot 25 minutes after ordering but the portions seemed skimpy. I like most people love cheesecake so I obviously ordered a slice. To be honest, I expected to be in cheesecake heaven. I thought I'd have my life flash before my eyes after biting into what's supposed to be the best cheesecake on earth. But that wasn't the case. It's a middle of the road cheesecake that extremely overpriced. I guess that's why when you look around the restaurant you don't see many people actually ordering it. They have plenty of options in terms of flavors but how do you price a slice of cheesecake almost as much as a steak entree? While the food is decent and the atmosphere is confusing but decent, the most important factor of this restaurant is disappointing. But it's not bad...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson
Trina T.,"Baltimore, MD",36,62,183,2.0,4/11/2017,We are regulars and the kitchen was off tonight my. Sauces were bland and threw off the taste of everything.

Azami N.,"Towson, MD",0,6,,4.0,11/27/2017,"Food was excellent and portion sizes were very large and filling. We went in for Saturday Sunday brunch (10-2pm) and my friend got Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Egg and I got the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict. Chicken was perfect, moist on the inside and with tasty batter on the outside, and went with the waffles well. My friend really liked the Chilaquiles. Server seemed rushed even though the restaurant was less than half full, but was quick to get anything forgotten like side of syrup or drinks.  The food was so satisfying neither of us could fit dessert at the end, but the cheesecake there is amazing, so we ordered two slices to go for when we weren't as stuffed. I was disappointed in how bland the white chocolate peppermint bark cheesecake was, didn't taste like much besides a lot of crunchy minty bits where's the cheesecake? but the reason I tried a new flavor is because I love so many of TCF's flavors! I admit I usually just go for cheesecake and not a whole meal, and then the Lemon Raspberry Cream or Chocolate Mousse cheesecakes are wonderful favorites. I took a chance on the Vanilla Bean cheesecake (too many places think vanilla means tasteless) and really enjoyed it, definite vanilla flavor and the crust, mousse, and cheesecake were all distinct and great together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson
Domo W.,"Elkridge, MD",143,5,2,1.0,3/31/2017,The service was okay but not exemplary. My food was less than okay and I am not a happy camper. How do you mess up an omelette I'm not really sure. As soon as it came out I knew it was going to be gross. Even the presentation wasn't good. Also did I mention how spongey my eggs were.

When we were seated the hostess took us to a table and it was not ready then she just disappeared and left us without a table in the middle of the restaurant. Fourth, she was very rude.

Kevin M.,"Baltimore, MD",163,288,68,3.0,3/15/2016,"I don't really know how to review this location because I come here so much, and sometimes it's great while other times it is dreadful... So I'm gonna meet them half way with a 3 star review... First of all, I absolutely love their happy hour menu items! All apps are five dollars and selected drinks are five dollars as well! I love to go with my boyfriend have a couple margaritas and nachos and just relax.  The service is definitely hit or miss! You can tell they no longer really hold their staff to the high service qualities they once did! You once would get a nice greet from the server who would break down things for you. Now you get more of a what's up welcome to cheesecake what do you want to drink? That's really sad because their service is one thing about the company I always loved! I'm here about 3-4 times a month and 3-4 times a month I get different service....  The bartenders.... There is only one I have encountered named Aja who is amazing, bubbly and friendly! If I see her at the bar I most definitely will sit there. Aside from her the other bartenders I have had are a bit dry and non personable....so I don't sit there unless Aja is working. The servers- man have they changed... Bare minimum service, not as friendly and social and knowledgable as they once were... I came across one I really liked and I will request him from now on... The management.... Oh the management.... Very sad from the beginning days of when they opened.... These managers look underdressed, disheveled and not very personable. One lady dropped my food off, she clearly was a manager. She just dropped food off and left!!!! I mean what a perfect opportunity to indulge the guest when you drop food off to them! All you have to do is smile and say hello and ask how everything is? Ask what brought us in... I mean something.... We received non of that.... But hey if the owners are ok with the store managers operating like that, who am I to say anything... The drinks, I love my margarita I get there... Aside from that I only order wine from their bar. The bartenders are trained to count liquor and never over pour or hook a drink up.... So what you get is a 1.25 ounce pour in your mixed drink... For those of you who don't know ounces it's not even enough to really taste in a vodka and cranberry for example.... Their drinks are rediculously OVER priced for the little amount of alcohol they do pour! So I recommend beer and wine unless it's happy hour... Then I would order some of their mixed drinks just to try.... The dessert, I have nothing bad to say their desserts are on point!!!!!!! However the bakery where you order Togo cheesecake, those attendants are not friendly, polite, or moderately personable! They are some of the most cold shouldered employees I have ever met. Hence why I do not order from them very often. I normally just order through my server or bartender....  I do really enjoy their food and desserts and drinks. I just don't always enjoy my service... I wish they would go back to their old ways and teach these servers what being a waiter is all about....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=20

On a more ""Yelp review"" note, I have never had a poor experience at this location.  The food and drinks are always done well.  I highly recommend the Fried Macaroni and Cheese appetizer, the Hershey's cheesecake, Mango Key Lime cheesecake, or the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake for dessert, and my new favorite, the Caribbean Cooler for a drink.  It is one of the tastiest blended drinks I've ever had.  At first I thought it was a virgin, but then again, the drink is better when you can't taste the alcohol right? ;) I always have luck parking in the garage right by the restaurant.  If you'r driving down Dulaney Valley from the I83 side, turn left right before the mall and you'll find a garage that also offers valet parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=20

Way too many things on the table; didn't get to eat the appetizer until last because I couldn't maneuver over my huge entree salad.  Also, the bus boy who kept cleaning the adjacent tables had a massive quantity of cologne on, which severely decreased the already limited enjoyment I was getting from my awkward meal. The waiter also took our check away before we had even paid, which made things even more awk. The food was good as usual, but the service was a big mess.

When I've ordered cheesecake from the bakery area, it's always been crowded and the wait for just one or two pieces of cheesecake can get a little long.

Steve S.,"Parsippany, NJ",562,1173,285,3.0,4/9/2015,"So it's honestly been about 15 years since I've eaten in a Cheesecake Factory and I wasn't a huge fan back then. My recent visit to this location didn't do much to change my mind. I don't think it's anything I can really put my finger on, but I'm just not as impressed as others. We arrived on a a Sunday - early afternoon and we're told it would be 15-20 minutes...40 minutes later we were seated...another 10 before we were asked about drinks and another 10 before we got the drinks...so an HOUR after we walked in the door we got our drinks.  I get it, you're busy, but you are ALWAYS busy...have enough people working! So the food itself was pretty good.  My daughter really liked her fish and chips and Cesar salad not the best she had, but she liked it.  My sine thought his chicken parm sandwich on french garlic bread WAS one of the tastiest he's had...and he swears it was the garlic bread.   My wife wasn't that hungry so she just ordered a house salad and a white chicken chili. She enjoyed it and said it was very flavorful and savory and just the right amlint...though she would have preferred it a bit spicier.  I tried the fish tacos wanted to have two grilled and two fried, but apparently that's impossible so I got all four fried. They were very good, as were the black beans.  We finished the meal with a slice of a chocolate cheesecake, which was very good, but not as good as Mom's.  So the service wasn't great...but I don't blame my server-side was just too busy and wasn't getting help from the bar or kitchen.  I've always thought Cheesecake Factory just tries to be too much...menu is huge and I don't think you can have superior food when you are trying to do so many different meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=20

I sent it back too! There pulled pork sandwich used to be phenomenal! Had it many times over the years. Now it's a sloppy mess with an overload of unneeded fixings. What a shame!  Only thing I really don't like is the wait time. Friday-Sunday is so busy! Good luck getting a table in under an hour. Shame they don't offer call ahead seating or reservations.

I asked for a GF menu, the hostess said that it is now a part of the regular menu - which is nice! I know how large their menu is but it's nice to see that some can be modified for my GF diet. We were placed in a 2-top near the bar.  When we sat down, I got up to use the restroom. Told my girlfriend to order me a water. Came out of the restroom, she hadn't arrived yet. 15 minutes later, still nothing. I told her I'd say something in 2 minutes but by then someone had popped over. We had picked what we wanted to order, so when she said ""let me get you rdrinks"" I said ""no, we can order."" I didn't want to lose her again! I ordered the chopped salad - gluten free. Dressing on the side.  We waited 35 minutes for our salads. I never saw the waitress again. When someone else brought me my salad, it looked great and I said... ""Actually I got dressing on the side, is there already dressing on it?"" She said ""No. But you got gluten free... and the only GF dressing we have is oil and vinegar.""  ...to which I replied... ""Then...can I have that?""  Ugh it was just a frustrating experience. There was a huge wait when we left. I'm a former server so I feel the pain of a busy Saturday lunch crowd but come on.

The basics are all good and what you would expect - pretty much anything that's not too crazy is good. However, orders that aren't so simple will be just ""okay.""

Edward S.,"Parkville, MD",0,67,1,4.0,4/3/2014,"So.., my wife and I were watching an episode of The Big Bang Theory and I suddenly had a hankering for dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. I'm not sure I can add any new insights for a chain that's been around so long. Colleen and I stop in to eat there about once a year. The food is always good but they tend to pile it on. (My personal belief is that a restaurant's portions should not be any more that a normal human can eat). Every thing (including my martini) was very tasty. I had the red velvet cheesecake for desert.  Now here is where you must have a strategy to eating your dinner if you want cheesecake for desert. Don't eat the bread that comes as you sit down, order something small or simply don't eat all the food piled up in front of you and you would normally have saved room for a piece of cheesecake. (Normally is the key word here). The piece of RVCC that landed in front of me was so good and so HUGE, I made myself sick. (Its the next day in the morning as I write this and I'm still feeling it).

K W.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,2.0,12/2/2016,"I love this place. Everyone knows that the food and atmosphere is good. However, I love the idea of the curbside pickup - when it works... the management should look at improving the customer service around curbside pickup. I keep trying to do curbside pickup - about once a week. It starts with the phone call. I typically call my order in when I'm about a half an hour away from the restaurant. However every time I call, I am put on hold. Most of the time, I'm on hold for an indefinite amount of time. Yesterday I waited for five minutes on hold until I hung up. I called back again and was put on hold for another 10 minutes. This is valuable time since I was driving to the restaurant and I needed that time for the food to be prepared, so the food would be ready when I got there. What needs to happen, is management needs to implement warm transfers. I was waiting to be transferred to the bakery so someone can at least place my order, but I couldn't even get my order placed because I was still on hold. So I called back and I talked to the lady who answered the phone and asked them to do a warm transfer over to the bakery. This means that someone would stay on the phone call and ensure that my transfer from one real human being to another real human being occurs. Instead the woman who answered the phone, Rachel, said that I just had to wait on hold and someone will answer when they get to me. It was a poor customer service experience for such a good restaurant.  Although I enjoy the restaurant, I probably won't do curbside anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=80

Not wanting to head to Lutherville, we decided ""why not"" never been there. well, everything we ordered was either good to excellent.

There are a lot of items to choose from. The cheesecake is delicious.     Most of the slices are big enough to share. My family usually orders two different kinds of slices and shares them. Be prepared to wait a long time to be seated. I have never had less than an hour wait here. Tonight the wait was 1 1/2 hours.

Haven't tried a bad one yet (but then again, it is cheesecake, can't really go wrong).    The Dulaney location sees its fair share of tired mall goers and packs of roving teenagers.  The wait can be a little long, hostesses a  little on the underage side and flaky, and the waitstaff just about the same.  Lighting is somewhat dim, and the space is tight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=120

With all the people they cram in there, it gets really loud. I've been there 3-4 times and never had an appetizer or entree that was worth the price. Despite all the oil and salt the kitchen adds, the food lacks distinct flavor and character. Their mixed drinks are pretty good, though many are syrupy-sweet.

Deborah G.,"Timonium, MD",20,156,54,4.0,6/25/2013,"Lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in the Towson location proved to be delightful. Usually chain restaurants are not my favorites but this one changed my mind so much I ordered a bunch of gift cards so i could return another time. The menu is extensive and requires a good pair of reading glasses for those who have problems viewing lots of type on a page. I was given a book with many pages of food selections as well as a brochure with a number of skinnyliscious selections. Nothing tastes better than a nice fresh cold salad on a hot June day so I ordered the French garden salad with grilled chicken (from the skinny menu) and a glass of cold iced tea. In about 15 minutes my food came out as I was finishing reading an article about how couples criticize each other. The server presented me with a huge beautiful salad with field greens, beets (there could have been a few more) candied pecans, goat cheese and perfectly grilled sliced chicken. This was  a salad masterpiece created by the staff in the Cheesecake Factory kitchen. I ate the whole thing with a very nice tangy sweet balsamic vinaigrette dressing that I drizzled on it. There was a bit too much purple cabbage but I pulled it out so i could taste the other greens. The chicken was perfectly  grilled without grease and was fork tender. I have no criticism of this lunch. The service was perfect, the iced tea was real and the salad was delish. The bill was not cheap for sure but somehow I did not mind paying for good food and such a nice experience. I can't wait to receive my gift cards so I can return in the near future. Bon appetit as Julia Childs would have said. I checked out the restroom and noted that the facility was clean and well stocked. Lastly, the place was busy for a Tuesday but the noise level was fine and there was no strange annoying music playing in the restaurant to disturb people who wanted to chat over lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=120
Stephanie B.,"Severna Park, MD",82,67,31,2.0,12/8/2012,"This location is ALWAYS busy. I have never come here and had a wait time of less than 40 minutes. Here are some suggestions if you plan to come here:  A.) Don't come when you're really hungry--You may be driven to cannibalism while you're waiting for a table.  B.) Don't come here without reading material/smart phone gaming/portable movie player/folding chair--Since their ""table pagers"" that they give you will not get a signal beyond 10 feet of their doors, going for a walk around the mall as you wait 3 hours for a table is out of the question. You need to stay entertained somehow. What's the folding chair for? Oh, that's for your you to rest your aching feet. There is ONE (1) long bench that is there in the lobby waiting area (inside) and a couple benches beyond the doors of the mall entrance, and as you can imagine, they fill up quickly. This means, you'll be left with standing for the entire length of time until you get a table assignment which typically takes between 40mins to 1 hr 30 mins for a party of 2-4 people. C.) DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE A PARTY LARGER THAN FOUR PEOPLE. We made the mistake of coming here with 6 of us one time, and we had a 2 hour wait. They wouldn't even give us a pager until the wait time was at the 1 hour mark, but after waiting 2 hours and 40 minutes, we decided to just hit up P.F. Changs right next door.  Trust me, the quality of service that you'll get isn't typically worth the stress of the long wait times. I've been here a handfull of times, and each time I am asking myself it it really is worth it. Answer: NO.

I got the pear martini which was both refreshing and just slightly sweet. I had a wonderful birthday dinner and our serve was spot on. So thank you cheesecake factory for finally being a chain that I will continue to go back too.

I can never finish them and I think leftover salads are just gross, so i liked this better. If you order any entrees from the standard menu prepare to have leftovers.

I've been to this location many times, so here is my all inclusive review: Things I Like: - Without question, the most robust menu in all of restaurantland. They have EVERYTHING, aaaaand they launched a ""skinny"" menu.  - Full bar with creative specialty drinks. - Ridiculous amount of fun choices for cheesecake/dessert. Can't go wrong with any of it. - Most importantly, they might have THE BEST WAITSTAFF SERVICE in the county. Management there has done a great job creating a culture that spoils it's guests. Things I Don't Like:  - Prices are taller than usual chain restaurant, and quantities match. While paying a little extra is sometimes necessary to have better food, I feel the overbearing quantities that go to waste are what I am actually paying for. But some fans of Cheesecake Factory really value this aspect. - MAKING YOUR CUSTOMERS WAIT. On a Friday or Saturday night you will arrive and wait for a table between 45 minutes to an hour. A whole blob of impatient and hungry people get blinking vibrators to taunt them as they wait I a ""holding pen"" type if area. This is awful. CF doesn't take reservations. This is kind of lame. I no longer go to this restaurant on hose nights, and I go less often overall. In conclusion, any other day of the week besides Friday/Saturday, this place is great. I have them 4 stars.

I called to let them know that I had arrived for our order that we called in. I watched as they walked out of the door and delivered to other drivers in their car. Each time another employee walked out, they walked right past my car. After sitting there for 30 minutes, I called again to let them know I was still there and again provided them with the color and make of my car and even told them that I was parked right in front of the door, where they were walking out. The girl said, ""Ok"". Another 20 minutes passed and I again called to tell them I was there to pick up an order and gave them the name of the order and again, the make and color of my car and my location. The guy on the phone didn't seem to care and had a slight arrogance to his voice, almost annoyed that I was calling. During the entire fiasco, there wasn't any employee who walked out with food and took it back. My wife called to find out what was going on and I told her. She too, called the restaurant where they proceeded to tell her that they'd look into. After sitting next to the curb, in front of the door that they walked out of, for an hour I finally left, angry. As a customer, we did everything that we were supposed to. Cheesecake Factory, as a provider of goods and services, failed miserably in their responsibilities. After I arrived home, my wife called to speak to the manager. To our surprise, he lied right to her, telling her that on three different occasions, they walked out and couldn't locate me. I can't believe a manager would do something like that. This particular location needs to start over with their staff, from the hostess all the way up to the manager. Every visit we have had horrible customer service and when we bring it up, no one seems to care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=40

But the wait at this sucker is almost ALWAYS more than an hour. I'd say about 3 out of the around 10 I've been here the wait has been minimal. I do wish they had a call-ahead wait list, because people-watching in Towson Town Center is fun for about 4 minutes, then it gets gross. It is miserable waiting for this bitch. Moving on, a plus of this CF is it seems big... more booths. But I don't really think there are more booths, as I've been seated in those dumb long tables where you're nearly elbowing the people next to you several times.  My food has been generally okay, but a few times things have been lukewarm instead of hot, and that is not something I feel comfortable complaining about.  The service has always been fine here. Except the hostesses/hosts. They seem like they have a 'tude, when pa-lease, they should be the ones trying to win us back after we've waited 90 minutes to be seated.

The prices are very reasonable, the portions pretty large and the quality, always great. The service has been lacking on one occasion, but that was the exception and i won't let that ruin my opinion of this fine chain restaurant. I usually get one of the very imaginative chicken dishes or a steak combo platter. You can't go wrong with one of their BIG SALADS either.

I would  suggest to not go on weekends unless you don't mind the wait like 30 mins plus. The decor is classy yet comfortable and casual. Everything on the menu is made fresh. The prices are a little high about $8-10 for an appetizer and an entree would range $20 or so. The portions equal what we pay, big portions. The hot wings are huge meaty and fabulous. Some of my friends go JUST for the wings!        I get the Jamaican shrimp with rice, beans, plantains and mango  salsa. That runs about $20 and is well worth it, spicy and sweet. My friend got the steak and fries. They enjoyed it, tender juicy and a big portion of great tasting fries. You can order a side of mac & cheese that'll cost about $4.95 but the portions of it you'll definately have some for a doggybag.

The problem for me is their menu is so huge, I've yet to find anything I absolutely love. However, I think I finally found my meal there. First, the wait was surprisingly short. I'm used to having to wait at least half an hour. We had a wait but it wasn't too bad. The service was good too, as it always is. They must put a big emphasis on service there because I've never had a bad experience in regards to that. Then, the food. I got the meat loaf which was amazing. I was tossing up whether to get the sandwich or the meal. I got the meal, but I asked for a side of the tomato bacon jam because I thought it sounded interesting (it comes on the meat loaf sandwich). It was all so good, including the jam. The brown gravy on the meat loaf is good too but the jam is something different. You can get meat loaf with brown gravy anywhere. It comes with mashed potatoes and corn succotash, and boy was that succotash good.

The decor at this Cheesecake factory is Egyptian themed and looks great, high ceilings marble,hard wood, very nice. The food and service were good as well. But just good. Not quite as nice as the face she puts forth. We started with fried calamari, it was fresh and tasty, a nice portion.  For dinner my date had the Fish n Chips and I did the Cajun Jambalaya pasta. 4 large battered pieces of hand battered fish. I tasted some, OK, not bad. Lots of batter though. My Jambalaya was decent, medium sized shrimp, chicken, onions peppers and tomatoes in a spicy sauce over a bed of linguine. Not incredible just reliable good food. For desert I had the strawberry shortcake with fresh strawberries,  this is where CF shines...good stuff.It was huge I couldn't finish it. My date had the peanut butter something cheesecake, she said it was good. I didn't taste it, I'm not a cheesecake fan.

miss b.,"Baltimore, MD",2,47,,4.0,5/11/2010,"I went to Cheesecake Factory on Monday night and was a fan of it. I had only been once and it was to the location downtown. I parked in the garage between Fridays and The Cheesecake Factory without a problem and was able to walk down the steps right to the Cheesecake Factory. My friends were already there and seated and said they only had to wait 5 minutes. Awesome...considering I thought it'd be atleast an hour wait because it was 6 o'clock and they take you on a first come, first serve basis.  When I walked in the place was already pretty hopping. For appetizers we ordered crab dip and calamari which was yummy. They also gave us lots of bread which we also used to dip into the crab dip since it had only tiny slivers of bread that came with it. There was a ton of calamari that came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce which was very yummy even though I'm not too fond of knowing that it was squid. For dinner I ordered a special that was breaded chicken in a light wine butter sauce with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I think that there could have been more sauce, but it did come with two huge chicken breasts. I did enjoy it and thought it was different even though it didn't knock my socks off. My other friend ordered the same thing as me, and my two other friends ordered the Shrimp Scampi and Cajun Jambalaya Pasta that had shrimp, chicken sauteed with onions, tomato, and peppers in a spicy cajun sauce on top of linguini.  Portions seemed huge and while some things on the menu can definitely be pricey, but there are also some pretty reasonable choices as well depending on what you get. For dessert my friend ordered a Banana Cream Cheesecake which I had a few bites of which was of course delicious, and my other friends ordered and shared a Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake. I mean, you can't really go wrong with a huge slice of cheesecake. Our waitress was really sweet and really on the ball with refilling drinks (and bringing a bowl of lemons for the water!) which I liked and our appetizers came out pretty much right away. I really liked the decorations and the design of the place. It was huge inside. I was also in a good mood that there was no line, although I'm aware that sometimes this place can get pretty packed and waits can be aware from an hour to two hours and even longer. Also heard that valet parking is $5 bucks which could be worth it if parking is a bummer, which I know it can be. Sometimes the parking garages can fill up fast.

Mike b.,"New York, NY",0,29,,2.0,9/12/2010,"Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the fact that the Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu so there is something for everyone. The food is always consistent across locations too, so that wasn't my problem. My problem was the 3 hour dining time. After a half hour wait I had what might be the worst waiter I've ever had at any restaurant in my life. This guy, Thomas I think his name was (looks like a combination of Jack Sparrow / Spencer from Criminal minds) was horrible. I could've lived with the fact that he was socially retarded, but the the fact that I couldn't live with is how shitty the service was. Not only did our glasses spend most of the time empty, but it seemed like he was trying to avoid coming to anybody's table and whenever he did it was to remind us that he forgot to do whatever he said he was going to do. It seemed like it took a half hour for everything, half hour to bring us drinks, half hour to take our orders, half hour to bring us refills, check, dessert menu, etc. It was just frustrating because I didn't intend to spend my whole night at a Cheesecake factory, dinner shouldn't exceed an hour. I thought maybe we were being impatient but I heard the table across from us asking another waiter about him too because they didn't seem to be a fan either. I've never really felt the need to Yelp a chain restaurant before but I'd love to hear if other Yelpers have had this guy too and I hope maybe they can move him off of tables so people don't go through what we did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=160
Paul S.,"Towson, MD",84,158,69,4.0,10/4/2010,"As much as I love Cheesecake Factory, it's actually not perfect. It has some major flaws. As great as the food is it's been less and less about customer service. Lines are out the door, you are lucky enough to get a table on an off night or before the dinner rush. Forget any other time. If you get a table you are waiting a very long time for food. The food portions are very large but so are the prices. An appetizer could feed a family so if you wanna go cheap order an app. Though at this place cheap is unheard of. The ambiance is nice, great for a date type setting. 99 percent of the time food comes out great though once I went here and a bone wasn't removed from the pulled pork and I hit my tooth on it and my friend's burger was way undercooked. That's what happens when they don't quality check the food. We did get our meals comped on the same night and I got a replacement meal so they do try to make up for short comings. The menu is vast for apps meals and cheesecake varieties. Everyone can find something.

Reid C.,"Towson, MD",0,6,,2.0,4/10/2009,"It has been about ten years since I had been to the Cheesecake Factory downtown.  My recollection was that the cheesecake was superb, the portions were absurdly large and the non-dessert food was poor.  Today, my family decided to try the new Towson location for lunch. We arrived at 12:15 and were told that the wait would be about 20 minutes.  This proved to be accurate.  Once we were seated we ordered our beverages including specifying that we wanted lemon with the iced teas.  The drinks were delivered, but no lemons.  We asked for lemons two more times before they were delivered.  Among our orders, a caesar salad was requested with the dressing on the side.  It came drowned in dressing.  This was bad enough, but furthermore, the caesar dressing was terrible as these things go.  The herb-crusted salmon on another salad was cold, undercooked and smothered with wet herbs (i.e. not ""crusted"" in any way).  A Pizzete appetizer was good, the four cheese pasta was fine and some chicken tenders were OK too.  The fries had been salted so heavily that they were barely edible.    As I feared, we had more food left over than we had been able to consume.  Since the salads had been drowned in dressing, they were not salvageable.  This single location must throw out enough food in a month to feed a small country.  I am not a religious person, but I found myself thinking that the waste was positively sinful. We did order a slice of Oreo cheesecake to go.  I ate some of it tonight, and it was superb. To sum up, Cheesecake Factory has not changed at all in ten years.  My recommendation is to eat your meal next door at P.F.

We arrived at 12:15 and were told that the wait would be about 20 minutes.  This proved to be accurate.  Once we were seated we ordered our beverages including specifying that we wanted lemon with the iced teas.  The drinks were delivered, but no lemons.  We asked for lemons two more times before they were delivered.  Among our orders, a caesar salad was requested with the dressing on the side.  It came drowned in dressing.  This was bad enough, but furthermore, the caesar dressing was terrible as these things go.  The herb-crusted salmon on another salad was cold, undercooked and smothered with wet herbs (i.e. not ""crusted"" in any way).  A Pizzete appetizer was good, the four cheese pasta was fine and some chicken tenders were OK too.  The fries had been salted so heavily that they were barely edible.    As I feared, we had more food left over than we had been able to consume.  Since the salads had been drowned in dressing, they were not salvageable.  This single location must throw out enough food in a month to feed a small country.  I am not a religious person, but I found myself thinking that the waste was positively sinful. We did order a slice of Oreo cheesecake to go.  I ate some of it tonight, and it was superb. To sum up, Cheesecake Factory has not changed at all in ten years.  My recommendation is to eat your meal next door at P.F. Chang's and then buy some Cheesecake to go and eat it when you get home for dessert.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=140

Well, we both paid the gastrointestinal distressed price.  . . for 2 days.  When the waitress asked (in an half-hearted way) ""how was the meal"", we told her LOUSY!  Not fresh, fish stank, etc.  We got no response from the waitress or management.  We ate our piece of obligatory over-priced cheesecake (split 3 ways) and escaped.  Not good, not worth the money.  Place was packed, so I guess they think they do not have to care about the food quality or customer service.

Since they don't offer reservations I have set up two parties at this location (meaning showed up 2 hours before the event) and they have always had an excuse when it's time for the area I waited for being available. So that's been a let down. The manager the second time comped some appetizers on the house but my guest were starving from the wait so many people were upset.  The food at this location is delicious! I have only experienced one issue before and it wasn't their fault. The service to get our food was average which was disappointing. The waitress we had wasn't the most personable person but we were all still nice with her. The appetizers came at a decent rate but our main entrees were all coming out at all different times. That was disappointing for the simple fact everyone was starving! Even though the food wasn't all on point one thing that truly was were the drinks! I ordered three and they were all pleasant!

Dan H.,"Shrewsbury, United States",5,26,33,1.0,4/10/2017,"I'm giving two stars becouse this place was just that bad. The menu is huge, don't know the exact number but around 14 pages long. I ended up choosing the chicken crusted Romano ($17). While waiting on my food, i also had to wait on my drink to be refilled, for at least 5 to 10 minutes as many a waitress and waiter passed by it sat empty. Finally I had to stop a waitress passing by in order to get my drink refilled. This was a Tuesday night, with no wait to be seated mind you, so no legit reason for anything to be taking so long.  When our food arrived, my noodles where under cooked and the chicken.... well for $17, when you order what is essentially chicken parmesan, you picture a real piece of chicken and fully cooked noodles. The chicken was more of a McDonald's nugget style. Not real chicken, more like mashed meat, formed and shaped into a flat piece of meat with a crust on it. Not at all what $17 Should have gotten me. The drink I ordered was a long island iced tea. Which is 90% alcohol. Not this drink, 10% alcohol max. It was so watered down it tasted more along the lines of a soda than an alcoholic beverage, and they cost over $11 to boot. The service was extremely slow. Literraly over 10 minutes just for the waitress to get the check and bring it back. Unreal.

Charlie L.,"Baltimore, United States",156,98,176,3.0,19/12/2016,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory and with it comes some pro's and cons. The pros: -Location (within the Towson center Mall) -Busy area of towson The Cons: -Parking can be a hassle -Service Personally, I think the Cheesecake Factory has one major flaw that's universal to all it's branches; The fact that they try to cater to everyone! Their menu is like a book.  There's so many pages and so many items that it takes you 15 minutes just to look through.  It's impractical and actually makes it frustrating as a customer.  I think from a marketing standpoint, it's ridiculous. The other downfall of this particular location is probably service.  service is highly dependent on your server and since you're so close to the Towson Area, most of your servers tend to be young ""adults""/college kids.  With that said, you'll NEVER get the same consistency of service twice.  Some visits may be outstanding, while other times, can be just so-so. I'll admit, this is your typical cheesecake factory, nothing more and nothing less.  It's not outstanding, but it's good for a meal if you're around and want something that's not super expensive.  And, of course, the meal portions can feed 10.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson

However, I must dissect this Towson location and even comment on a few issues controlled by corporate. The location is nice and most importantly clean. However, I don't understand the decor. It's quite confusing and kinda reminds me of an Indian restaurant. The food prices are not super pricey, but certainly not the most affordable. The food came hot 25 minutes after ordering but the portions seemed skimpy. I like most people love cheesecake so I obviously ordered a slice. To be honest, I expected to be in cheesecake heaven. I thought I'd have my life flash before my eyes after biting into what's supposed to be the best cheesecake on earth. But that wasn't the case. It's a middle of the road cheesecake that extremely overpriced. I guess that's why when you look around the restaurant you don't see many people actually ordering it. They have plenty of options in terms of flavors but how do you price a slice of cheesecake almost as much as a steak entree?

Chicken was perfect, moist on the inside and with tasty batter on the outside, and went with the waffles well. My friend really liked the Chilaquiles. Server seemed rushed even though the restaurant was less than half full, but was quick to get anything forgotten like side of syrup or drinks.  The food was so satisfying neither of us could fit dessert at the end, but the cheesecake there is amazing, so we ordered two slices to go for when we weren't as stuffed. I was disappointed in how bland the white chocolate peppermint bark cheesecake was, didn't taste like much besides a lot of crunchy minty bits where's the cheesecake? but the reason I tried a new flavor is because I love so many of TCF's flavors! I admit I usually just go for cheesecake and not a whole meal, and then the Lemon Raspberry Cream or Chocolate Mousse cheesecakes are wonderful favorites.

So I'm gonna meet them half way with a 3 star review... First of all, I absolutely love their happy hour menu items! All apps are five dollars and selected drinks are five dollars as well! I love to go with my boyfriend have a couple margaritas and nachos and just relax.  The service is definitely hit or miss! You can tell they no longer really hold their staff to the high service qualities they once did! You once would get a nice greet from the server who would break down things for you. Now you get more of a what's up welcome to cheesecake what do you want to drink? That's really sad because their service is one thing about the company I always loved! I'm here about 3-4 times a month and 3-4 times a month I get different service....  The bartenders.... There is only one I have encountered named Aja who is amazing, bubbly and friendly! If I see her at the bar I most definitely will sit there. Aside from her the other bartenders I have had are a bit dry and non personable....so I don't sit there unless Aja is working. The servers- man have they changed... Bare minimum service, not as friendly and social and knowledgable as they once were... I came across one I really liked and I will request him from now on... The management.... Oh the management.... Very sad from the beginning days of when they opened.... These managers look underdressed, disheveled and not very personable. One lady dropped my food off, she clearly was a manager. She just dropped food off and left!!!! I mean what a perfect opportunity to indulge the guest when you drop food off to them! All you have to do is smile and say hello and ask how everything is? Ask what brought us in... I mean something.... We received non of that.... But hey if the owners are ok with the store managers operating like that, who am I to say anything... The drinks, I love my margarita I get there... Aside from that I only order wine from their bar. The bartenders are trained to count liquor and never over pour or hook a drink up.... So what you get is a 1.25 ounce pour in your mixed drink... For those of you who don't know ounces it's not even enough to really taste in a vodka and cranberry for example.... Their drinks are rediculously OVER priced for the little amount of alcohol they do pour! So I recommend beer and wine unless it's happy hour... Then I would order some of their mixed drinks just to try.... The dessert, I have nothing bad to say their desserts are on point!!!!!!! However the bakery where you order Togo cheesecake, those attendants are not friendly, polite, or moderately personable! They are some of the most cold shouldered employees I have ever met. Hence why I do not order from them very often. I normally just order through my server or bartender....  I do really enjoy their food and desserts and drinks. I just don't always enjoy my service...

Appetizers- Avocado eggrolls (FAVORITE), buffalo chicken crisps, firecracker salmon rolls, crab balls, dynamite shrimp...I could go on and on literally all the apps are amazing! Entrees- I never thought I'd say this but the Kale and quinoa salad is AMAZING!!! It's hands down my favorite thing to get now. It comes in a huge proportion with a delicious lemon vinaigrette dressing. The perfect balance of sweet and salty. Other entress that are good is the Louisiana chicken. The portions here are very big and filling so plan to take home a to go box. The cheesecake speaks for itself. There are dozens of flavors and they all taste delicious! My favorites are the lemonchello, peanut butter, red velvet, key lime, banana cream, oreo, strawberry and turtle. Fyi the happy hour is also really nice. They have $6 food and drink items.

On my most recent visit, here is the order the food came out: 1) entrees 2) bread 3) soup 4) butter for the bread 5) appetizer The waiter kept apologizing, but never worked her way out of the fluster, and things kept going wrong. Way too many things on the table; didn't get to eat the appetizer until last because I couldn't maneuver over my huge entree salad.  Also, the bus boy who kept cleaning the adjacent tables had a massive quantity of cologne on, which severely decreased the already limited enjoyment I was getting from my awkward meal. The waiter also took our check away before we had even paid, which made things even more awk. The food was good as usual, but the service was a big mess. Also, there was a super annoying loud talker sitting next to me and reading every menu item and description out loud, but I guess that's not their fault.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=20

The wait can get very long but you always get the quality food that's a little over priced, but you know you're going to spend that much when you go to Cheesecake.  When I've ordered cheesecake from the bakery area, it's always been crowded and the wait for just one or two pieces of cheesecake can get a little long. The workers are usually pretty frantic and working as hard as they can so its not really their fault.

Steve S.,"Parsippany, United States",562,1174,285,3.0,9/4/2015,"So it's honestly been about 15 years since I've eaten in a Cheesecake Factory and I wasn't a huge fan back then. My recent visit to this location didn't do much to change my mind. I don't think it's anything I can really put my finger on, but I'm just not as impressed as others. We arrived on a a Sunday - early afternoon and we're told it would be 15-20 minutes...40 minutes later we were seated...another 10 before we were asked about drinks and another 10 before we got the drinks...so an HOUR after we walked in the door we got our drinks.  I get it, you're busy, but you are ALWAYS busy...have enough people working! So the food itself was pretty good.  My daughter really liked her fish and chips and Cesar salad not the best she had, but she liked it.  My sine thought his chicken parm sandwich on french garlic bread WAS one of the tastiest he's had...and he swears it was the garlic bread.   My wife wasn't that hungry so she just ordered a house salad and a white chicken chili. She enjoyed it and said it was very flavorful and savory and just the right amlint...though she would have preferred it a bit spicier.  I tried the fish tacos wanted to have two grilled and two fried, but apparently that's impossible so I got all four fried. They were very good, as were the black beans.  We finished the meal with a slice of a chocolate cheesecake, which was very good, but not as good as Mom's.  So the service wasn't great...but I don't blame my server-side was just too busy and wasn't getting help from the bar or kitchen.  I've always thought Cheesecake Factory just tries to be too much...menu is huge and I don't think you can have superior food when you are trying to do so many different meals.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=20

That was what I mistakenly ordered. I sent it back too! There pulled pork sandwich used to be phenomenal! Had it many times over the years. Now it's a sloppy mess with an overload of unneeded fixings. What a shame!  Only thing I really don't like is the wait time. Friday-Sunday is so busy! Good luck getting a table in under an hour.

I asked for a GF menu, the hostess said that it is now a part of the regular menu - which is nice! I know how large their menu is but it's nice to see that some can be modified for my GF diet. We were placed in a 2-top near the bar.  When we sat down, I got up to use the restroom. Told my girlfriend to order me a water. Came out of the restroom, she hadn't arrived yet. 15 minutes later, still nothing. I told her I'd say something in 2 minutes but by then someone had popped over. We had picked what we wanted to order, so when she said ""let me get you rdrinks"" I said ""no, we can order."" I didn't want to lose her again! I ordered the chopped salad - gluten free. Dressing on the side.  We waited 35 minutes for our salads. I never saw the waitress again. When someone else brought me my salad, it looked great and I said... ""Actually I got dressing on the side, is there already dressing on it?"" She said ""No. But you got gluten free... and the only GF dressing we have is oil and vinegar.""  ...to which I replied... ""Then...can I have that?""  Ugh it was just a frustrating experience. There was a huge wait when we left. I'm a former server so I feel the pain of a busy Saturday lunch crowd but come on.

Mel L.,"Pikesville, United States",170,46,193,4.0,29/11/2015,"I have had a large variety from the Cheesecake Factory in Towson. Sliders, pasta carbonara, loaded potatoes, mac and cheese balls, edamame, etc, as well as dabbling in my fair share of cheesecakes. I love Cheesecake Factory and I talk about coming here whenever the opportunity presents itself. The food is rich and the portions are huge and worth the expense. You will go home not only satisfied once but satisfied twice as you will most likely have leftovers.  This is a nice location although if it's possible to go to the one at the inner harbor, it is worth going as it is beautiful, spacious, and has great service! The outdoor seating in Towson is noisy but still pretty. Both locations are great for dates, parties/gatherings, or just hanging out.  I will say that they definitely skimp out on cheesecake when it is for take out. I was given a sliver from Towson for the same price as dining in. Not cool. Would rather dine in, just order cheesecake, and take it home.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=40

Michael G.,"Baltimore, United States",79,107,88,4.0,18/4/2014,"At this point, if you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory, you need to boost your social life! I've been to this location many times, so here is my all inclusive review: Things I Like: - Without question, the most robust menu in all of restaurantland. They have EVERYTHING, aaaaand they launched a ""skinny"" menu.  - Full bar with creative specialty drinks. - Ridiculous amount of fun choices for cheesecake/dessert. Can't go wrong with any of it. - Most importantly, they might have THE BEST WAITSTAFF SERVICE in the county. Management there has done a great job creating a culture that spoils it's guests. Things I Don't Like:  - Prices are taller than usual chain restaurant, and quantities match. While paying a little extra is sometimes necessary to have better food, I feel the overbearing quantities that go to waste are what I am actually paying for. But some fans of Cheesecake Factory really value this aspect. - MAKING YOUR CUSTOMERS WAIT. On a Friday or Saturday night you will arrive and wait for a table between 45 minutes to an hour. A whole blob of impatient and hungry people get blinking vibrators to taunt them as they wait I a ""holding pen"" type if area. This is awful. CF doesn't take reservations. This is kind of lame. I no longer go to this restaurant on hose nights, and I go less often overall. In conclusion, any other day of the week besides Friday/Saturday, this place is great. I have them 4 stars. To earn 5, they need to take better care of their guests and establish a reservation system that eliminates abusive waiting experiences.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=40

ShaUn H.,"Sterling Heights, United States",1,11,,1.0,9/2/2015,"We ordered the curbside to go and it was a disaster. We figured that we'd call and place our order before the dinner rush. While the on the phone they told us that it would be 30 minutes. I arrived at the curb and in front of their white backdoor about 25 minutes after we placed our order. I called to let them know that I had arrived for our order that we called in. I watched as they walked out of the door and delivered to other drivers in their car. Each time another employee walked out, they walked right past my car. After sitting there for 30 minutes, I called again to let them know I was still there and again provided them with the color and make of my car and even told them that I was parked right in front of the door, where they were walking out. The girl said, ""Ok"". Another 20 minutes passed and I again called to tell them I was there to pick up an order and gave them the name of the order and again, the make and color of my car and my location. The guy on the phone didn't seem to care and had a slight arrogance to his voice, almost annoyed that I was calling. During the entire fiasco, there wasn't any employee who walked out with food and took it back. My wife called to find out what was going on and I told her. She too, called the restaurant where they proceeded to tell her that they'd look into. After sitting next to the curb, in front of the door that they walked out of, for an hour I finally left, angry. As a customer, we did everything that we were supposed to. Cheesecake Factory, as a provider of goods and services, failed miserably in their responsibilities. After I arrived home, my wife called to speak to the manager. To our surprise, he lied right to her, telling her that on three different occasions, they walked out and couldn't locate me. I can't believe a manager would do something like that. This particular location needs to start over with their staff, from the hostess all the way up to the manager.

Edward S.,"Parkville, United States",0,67,1,4.0,3/4/2014,"So.., my wife and I were watching an episode of The Big Bang Theory and I suddenly had a hankering for dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. I'm not sure I can add any new insights for a chain that's been around so long. Colleen and I stop in to eat there about once a year. The food is always good but they tend to pile it on. (My personal belief is that a restaurant's portions should not be any more that a normal human can eat). Every thing (including my martini) was very tasty. I had the red velvet cheesecake for desert.  Now here is where you must have a strategy to eating your dinner if you want cheesecake for desert. Don't eat the bread that comes as you sit down, order something small or simply don't eat all the food piled up in front of you and you would normally have saved room for a piece of cheesecake. (Normally is the key word here). The piece of RVCC that landed in front of me was so good and so HUGE, I made myself sick. (Its the next day in the morning as I write this and I'm still feeling it).  In this case (as with most), less is more.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=80
K W.,"Baltimore, United States",0,1,,2.0,2/12/2016,"I love this place. Everyone knows that the food and atmosphere is good. However, I love the idea of the curbside pickup - when it works... the management should look at improving the customer service around curbside pickup. I keep trying to do curbside pickup - about once a week. It starts with the phone call. I typically call my order in when I'm about a half an hour away from the restaurant. However every time I call, I am put on hold. Most of the time, I'm on hold for an indefinite amount of time. Yesterday I waited for five minutes on hold until I hung up. I called back again and was put on hold for another 10 minutes. This is valuable time since I was driving to the restaurant and I needed that time for the food to be prepared, so the food would be ready when I got there. What needs to happen, is management needs to implement warm transfers. I was waiting to be transferred to the bakery so someone can at least place my order, but I couldn't even get my order placed because I was still on hold. So I called back and I talked to the lady who answered the phone and asked them to do a warm transfer over to the bakery. This means that someone would stay on the phone call and ensure that my transfer from one real human being to another real human being occurs. Instead the woman who answered the phone, Rachel, said that I just had to wait on hold and someone will answer when they get to me. It was a poor customer service experience for such a good restaurant.  Although I enjoy the restaurant, I probably won't do curbside anymore.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=80

Their cheesecakes are a must (they offer a carry-out too, where you can buy their cheesecakes by the slice or the whole cake). What a variety!!! Their coffee is good... Date night-share two appetizers and drinks, can easily suffice as a meal...Parking is easy (mall garage or valet). Location is excellent. If you go on Friday-weekend nights, be prepared to wait...I don't think they take any reservations, but one can always order a drink at the bar and hang around, waiting, people-watching...Place is always hopping.

Cheesecake Factory: decent prices, very LARGE menu (probably 5 normal pages of menu items), inviting atmosphere, good food. The prices may seem expensive at first glance, but the portions you are given are about (2) servings of food and will last you for about two meals. And of course, the dessert: let's just say I've had pretty phenomenal cheesecake in New York but Cheesecake Factory is up to par and I'm no longer required to drive all the way to New York for a slice of heaven.

Not by first choice mind you, this was a geographic decision.But I have always enjoyed my CF visits. The decor at this Cheesecake factory is Egyptian themed and looks great, high ceilings marble,hard wood, very nice. The food and service were good as well. But just good. Not quite as nice as the face she puts forth. We started with fried calamari, it was fresh and tasty, a nice portion.  For dinner my date had the Fish n Chips and I did the Cajun Jambalaya pasta. 4 large battered pieces of hand battered fish. I tasted some, OK, not bad. Lots of batter though. My Jambalaya was decent, medium sized shrimp, chicken, onions peppers and tomatoes in a spicy sauce over a bed of linguine. Not incredible just reliable good food. For desert I had the strawberry shortcake with fresh strawberries,  this is where CF shines...good stuff.It was huge I couldn't finish it. My date had the peanut butter something cheesecake, she said it was good. I didn't taste it, I'm not a cheesecake fan. Our server was a friendly young man, kinda funny how he asked how something looked every time he placed a dish down, had me laughing. Check came to 73 bucks  for two minus tip..I guess someone's gotta pay for the marble and 30 foot ceilings.. All in all a good experience for a chain.

The adjacent  table was only a couple of inches away that it felt like we are practically one whole table. The size zero waitress didn't have any place to stand between the tables to take our order. And I could literally hear the the neighbours stomach growling!! lol.. Appetisers- 1. Sweet potato fries with the mustard dip was absolutely fantastic. Crispy,crunchy, sweet fries with a little bit of salt sprinkled on top !!!!!  2. Crispy  taquitos was ok-ok.. Nothing spectacular.. Entre- 1. My husband's order of Jambalaya pasta with chicken and shrimp was nice and full of flavour. You'll like it if you like spicy stuff.. They even put a good amount of shrimp and chicken it it. So that definitely is something we would definitely order again.  2. My Garlic noodle with shrimp was FLAVOURLESS, kind of SHRIMPLESS too.. The only thing good about the dish was the freshly grated cheese they put on top!! I asked the waitress about the dish having only a few shrimp, she told me that  they put only 4 per portion, which was exactly what i got.

I swear he's a mind reader of some sorts since he knew exactly what my friend was going to order to drink and the type of cheesecake she was going to get later. Or he's just a really good guesser. But still, he was hilarious and was a fantastic waiter. The food was amazing! My only complaint is that I wish my salad had more chicken in it.

Haven't tried a bad one yet (but then again, it is cheesecake, can't really go wrong).    The Dulaney location sees its fair share of tired mall goers and packs of roving teenagers.  The wait can be a little long, hostesses a  little on the underage side and flaky, and the waitstaff just about the same.  Lighting is somewhat dim, and the space is tight.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=120

With all the people they cram in there, it gets really loud. I've been there 3-4 times and never had an appetizer or entree that was worth the price. Despite all the oil and salt the kitchen adds, the food lacks distinct flavor and character. Their mixed drinks are pretty good, though many are syrupy-sweet.

Deborah G.,"Timonium, United States",20,156,54,4.0,25/6/2013,"Lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in the Towson location proved to be delightful. Usually chain restaurants are not my favorites but this one changed my mind so much I ordered a bunch of gift cards so i could return another time. The menu is extensive and requires a good pair of reading glasses for those who have problems viewing lots of type on a page. I was given a book with many pages of food selections as well as a brochure with a number of skinnyliscious selections. Nothing tastes better than a nice fresh cold salad on a hot June day so I ordered the French garden salad with grilled chicken (from the skinny menu) and a glass of cold iced tea. In about 15 minutes my food came out as I was finishing reading an article about how couples criticize each other. The server presented me with a huge beautiful salad with field greens, beets (there could have been a few more) candied pecans, goat cheese and perfectly grilled sliced chicken. This was  a salad masterpiece created by the staff in the Cheesecake Factory kitchen. I ate the whole thing with a very nice tangy sweet balsamic vinaigrette dressing that I drizzled on it. There was a bit too much purple cabbage but I pulled it out so i could taste the other greens. The chicken was perfectly  grilled without grease and was fork tender. I have no criticism of this lunch. The service was perfect, the iced tea was real and the salad was delish. The bill was not cheap for sure but somehow I did not mind paying for good food and such a nice experience. I can't wait to receive my gift cards so I can return in the near future. Bon appetit as Julia Childs would have said. I checked out the restroom and noted that the facility was clean and well stocked. Lastly, the place was busy for a Tuesday but the noise level was fine and there was no strange annoying music playing in the restaurant to disturb people who wanted to chat over lunch.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=120
Stephanie B.,"Severna Park, United States",82,67,31,2.0,8/12/2012,"This location is ALWAYS busy. I have never come here and had a wait time of less than 40 minutes. Here are some suggestions if you plan to come here:  A.) Don't come when you're really hungry--You may be driven to cannibalism while you're waiting for a table.  B.) Don't come here without reading material/smart phone gaming/portable movie player/folding chair--Since their ""table pagers"" that they give you will not get a signal beyond 10 feet of their doors, going for a walk around the mall as you wait 3 hours for a table is out of the question. You need to stay entertained somehow. What's the folding chair for? Oh, that's for your you to rest your aching feet. There is ONE (1) long bench that is there in the lobby waiting area (inside) and a couple benches beyond the doors of the mall entrance, and as you can imagine, they fill up quickly. This means, you'll be left with standing for the entire length of time until you get a table assignment which typically takes between 40mins to 1 hr 30 mins for a party of 2-4 people. C.) DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE A PARTY LARGER THAN FOUR PEOPLE. We made the mistake of coming here with 6 of us one time, and we had a 2 hour wait. They wouldn't even give us a pager until the wait time was at the 1 hour mark, but after waiting 2 hours and 40 minutes, we decided to just hit up P.F. Changs right next door.  Trust me, the quality of service that you'll get isn't typically worth the stress of the long wait times. I've been here a handfull of times, and each time I am asking myself it it really is worth it. Answer: NO. You're better off ordering the food to-go, and enjoying the meal in the comfort of your home...where there is NO WAIT TIME.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=120

miss b.,"Baltimore, United States",2,47,,4.0,11/5/2010,"I went to Cheesecake Factory on Monday night and was a fan of it. I had only been once and it was to the location downtown. I parked in the garage between Fridays and The Cheesecake Factory without a problem and was able to walk down the steps right to the Cheesecake Factory. My friends were already there and seated and said they only had to wait 5 minutes. Awesome...considering I thought it'd be atleast an hour wait because it was 6 o'clock and they take you on a first come, first serve basis.  When I walked in the place was already pretty hopping. For appetizers we ordered crab dip and calamari which was yummy. They also gave us lots of bread which we also used to dip into the crab dip since it had only tiny slivers of bread that came with it. There was a ton of calamari that came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce which was very yummy even though I'm not too fond of knowing that it was squid. For dinner I ordered a special that was breaded chicken in a light wine butter sauce with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I think that there could have been more sauce, but it did come with two huge chicken breasts. I did enjoy it and thought it was different even though it didn't knock my socks off. My other friend ordered the same thing as me, and my two other friends ordered the Shrimp Scampi and Cajun Jambalaya Pasta that had shrimp, chicken sauteed with onions, tomato, and peppers in a spicy cajun sauce on top of linguini.  Portions seemed huge and while some things on the menu can definitely be pricey, but there are also some pretty reasonable choices as well depending on what you get. For dessert my friend ordered a Banana Cream Cheesecake which I had a few bites of which was of course delicious, and my other friends ordered and shared a Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake. I mean, you can't really go wrong with a huge slice of cheesecake. Our waitress was really sweet and really on the ball with refilling drinks (and bringing a bowl of lemons for the water!) which I liked and our appetizers came out pretty much right away. I really liked the decorations and the design of the place. It was huge inside. I was also in a good mood that there was no line, although I'm aware that sometimes this place can get pretty packed and waits can be aware from an hour to two hours and even longer. Also heard that valet parking is $5 bucks which could be worth it if parking is a bummer, which I know it can be. Sometimes the parking garages can fill up fast.  However, if you want to go here, I'd suggest NOT looking at the calorie content of your meal online OR of that cheesecake that you think you want to delight yourself with at the end...",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=160
Mike b.,"New York, United States",0,29,,2.0,12/9/2010,"Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the fact that the Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu so there is something for everyone. The food is always consistent across locations too, so that wasn't my problem. My problem was the 3 hour dining time. After a half hour wait I had what might be the worst waiter I've ever had at any restaurant in my life. This guy, Thomas I think his name was (looks like a combination of Jack Sparrow / Spencer from Criminal minds) was horrible. I could've lived with the fact that he was socially retarded, but the the fact that I couldn't live with is how shitty the service was. Not only did our glasses spend most of the time empty, but it seemed like he was trying to avoid coming to anybody's table and whenever he did it was to remind us that he forgot to do whatever he said he was going to do. It seemed like it took a half hour for everything, half hour to bring us drinks, half hour to take our orders, half hour to bring us refills, check, dessert menu, etc. It was just frustrating because I didn't intend to spend my whole night at a Cheesecake factory, dinner shouldn't exceed an hour. I thought maybe we were being impatient but I heard the table across from us asking another waiter about him too because they didn't seem to be a fan either. I've never really felt the need to Yelp a chain restaurant before but I'd love to hear if other Yelpers have had this guy too and I hope maybe they can move him off of tables so people don't go through what we did.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=160
Paul S.,"Towson, United States",84,158,69,4.0,4/10/2010,"As much as I love Cheesecake Factory, it's actually not perfect. It has some major flaws. As great as the food is it's been less and less about customer service. Lines are out the door, you are lucky enough to get a table on an off night or before the dinner rush. Forget any other time. If you get a table you are waiting a very long time for food. The food portions are very large but so are the prices. An appetizer could feed a family so if you wanna go cheap order an app. Though at this place cheap is unheard of. The ambiance is nice, great for a date type setting. 99 percent of the time food comes out great though once I went here and a bone wasn't removed from the pulled pork and I hit my tooth on it and my friend's burger was way undercooked. That's what happens when they don't quality check the food. We did get our meals comped on the same night and I got a replacement meal so they do try to make up for short comings. The menu is vast for apps meals and cheesecake varieties. Everyone can find something. So if you are willing to overlook flaws and wait...and wait for what you love then you will enjoy it here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=160
Michael A.,"Washington, DC, United States",0,77,,1.0,27/2/2010,"The food is insanely fatty.  Pizzas are loaded up with cheese.  I felt horrible the next day.  I think this place might kill you if you eat there too often ( ).  Other than that, it seems like a nice, family-oriented place.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-towson?start=160
