J M.,"San Francisco, CA",4,116,192,5.0,4/10/2017,"I always try and stop at this Cheesecake Factory when I fly into SeaTac, as it's easy to stop here coming or going.  Their filet mignon is always prepared perfectly and is seasoned just right.  It comes with the best tasting mashed potatoes ever, and fresh green beans. I've had many of their menu choices over the years and I'm never disappointed. Service is usually pretty good too.  After all these years, I'm still partial to their passion iced tea, which is so much better than regular iced tea. And of course, what can you say about their cheesecake except that they're great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=40
David A.,"SeaTac, WA",0,3,1,5.0,3/12/2017,"My wife and I just left The Factory and we have to give our waitress, Monique C some major props! She is a very nice person; fairly new to the City from the Southside of Chicago and she brought a great personality and some real east-coast style from her hometown to our table. She gave us a great history lesson on Chicago and all its moving parts. Best wishes in Seattle! I'm certain that her Chi-town swag will take her to big-time places in the Great Northwest! Oh, the Spaghetti & Meatballs were 5 Star banging! I've been there many times and never tried the Spaghetti! It is Awesome Sauce!!!

J N.,"Issaquah, WA",1,18,4,1.0,12/14/2017,"Extremely disappointed with our experience here. We came to celebrate our friend's birthday - we had five different servers (not an exaggeration) we waited over an hour for our food to come out, and they did not say happy birthday or acknowledge it. However, they sang to the table next to us and brought out a sundae. Overall, we spent over two hours here and had horrible customer service. Never will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=40
Gloria T.,"Kent, WA",23,165,377,4.0,5/23/2017,"Best place for dessert! The menu is like an encyclopedia so it's hard to decide what to eat lol. I've tried burger, pasta, pizza, salad, steaks and multiple chicken dishes. Try almost everything on the small plate section. Nothing really stand out but nothing taste bad either. Some cheesecakes can be really sweet but then again...it is dessert. They don't take reservation so wait time can be long; especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Customer service is okay, can be slow sometimes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=40
Trina H.,"Renton, WA",2,45,14,5.0,6/3/2017,"I got a real reply, not an auto answer.  Thank you CCF for that. I hate calling a manager over to the table, but if we can be discreet. So I'm back.... and the lemon drop I ordered was fantastic. Got another one and that was even better. The two girls were Tiffany and Lucy our bartenders and Chenna, well she had all the right answers. Thanks CCF looks like bar stuff was taken care of.  BTW, presentation of the bar and napkin thing was really nice looking. Now the dinner we had.... freakin awesome! The service was spot on. Thanks much.

Kevin S.,"Seattle, WA",544,75,,2.0,10/7/2017,Not really a fan of this place any more of the food's okay but who wants to wait in a line for a chain especially one that charges a $10 for a piece of cheesecake also they don't carry a kids menu or kids coloring crayons or anything for kids to do which makes no sense,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=40
Jencen R.,"Bellevue, WA",901,475,751,4.0,1/28/2016,"The food is a 5 star as long as you stay away from over salted pasta dishes.  Service is a 4, because our waitress gave us a normal menu at the bar during happy hour instead of the cheaper happy hour menu. She was fast to fill up our water glasses though.  The atmosphere here is a 3, since the restaurant really is too small for the dinner rush they get. Really really busy and loud, even at 5pm on a week night. Word to the wise: don't bother with a host if you are there for happy hour. Walk right to the bar or the talk circular bar tables, even if there are dirty plates on the table. They will clean it up and get you a menu quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=40

I am REALLY frustrated! I went inside the restaurant, paid for my order and then waited forever, and ever AND EVER!!! Even after a reminder, I never imagined it would be a TWENTY-FIVE MINUTE WAIT when all I had to do was pay and pick up my singular piece of cheesecake.

Shonah M.,"Richmond, Canada",11,81,670,5.0,3/13/2016,"Have been to TCF several times over the past 10 years! Not sure what took so long for me to write a review - but last nights dinner had me wanting to share in words - all about it!  I have generally found TCF's to have a cool decor with lots of seating & a pleasant staff to serve you. I like the design & lighting - vibrant, welcoming & relaxing! Oh yeah - it was finally the day I got my -catfish! You see I've been requesting this dish for my last 4 visits & they were always sold out! Even tried ordering it downtown Seattle & Bellevue locations - no luck! Regardless I was still happy with my backup order but longed for the day I would finally get my catfish!!! We ordered the Southern Fried Catfish & Sheila's Chicken & Avocado Salad. These were the best 2 dishes I've had yet. I made it a point to always try a new dish every time I ate @ TCF. I started this 2 years ago always looking forward to something new to eat from the menu! Ok so back to the Catfish! It was so great! I've had Catfish at Sylvia's in Harlem & it was comparable - as in equal & delicious! The Chicken Avocado salad was the best salad I've had ever in awhile - a absolute must for salad lovers! The Citrus-Honey-Peanut Vinaigrette was awesome - I loved it!  We had the very refreshing Strawberry Lemonade to drink - always a delight! I've had a few of their other drinks - try any & all out on your next visit! It's been awhile since I finished off my plate at TCF! In fact I can only recall always going back to the hotel with a doggie bag! This was not one of those times! I ate everything on my plate!!! Now to cheesecake - we took to go - Salted Caramel & Vanilla Bean cheesecake. Yummy! I have tried the massive Sundae, Oreo Cheesecake, Mango Key Lime Cheesecake, Carrot Cake Cheesecake, & yes I love them all! A must try appetizer - Avocado Egg-rolls or Buffalo Wings(they are massive!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=40
Linh N.,"Seattle, WA",101,206,266,2.0,12/7/2015,"Came here for dinner with my best friend a couple nights ago because he saw someone's dinner on fb and he wanted to come and get the same thing haha.  I'll start by saying, service was REALLY slow. We sat in the bar area thinking service would be fast and we instantly regretted our decision. He ordered a beer right as we sat down, which was a smart idea because his beer came out really quick and my drink ended up taking like 15min. Our server took forever to come around to get our order and the food and bread took even longer. I was really turned off by the service at this point, but because I hadn't eaten anything all day. I tried to remain patience.( it wasn't busy At ALL ). We both ordered the Spicy chicken Louisiana pasta? It was good but I should have stuck to my reg pasta. I swear I had more chicken than pasta and that's great for someone that loves protein, but for someone that loves carbs like me, I was kind of disappointed haha. My friend also ordered this apple crisp cheesecake and devoured the whole thing in 3 bites.  But seriously, I would have given this more stars if the service wasn't so slow. We were there at 8 and didn't leave till 11. That's too much time to be sitting at a restaurant when it takes like 15 minutes to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=40

Brooklyn L.,"Auburn, WA",60,30,44,3.0,1/28/2017,"We came for lunch on Saturday as it was packed inside. Luckily, the wait was only about 15 minutes. Fancy food but so overpriced, especially cheesecakes around $7-8 a slice. I ordered chicken parmesan with mashed potatoes. One of the best I've tasted! The green beans that came with it had a weird sweet aftertaste though. Also raspberry lemonade was super sweet that I had to share with others and dilute the flavor for lesser tense of sugar lol. Our waitress was very friendly when she helped us out on what to order at first. Salted caramel is absolutely amazing.

Worldly F.,"Seattle, WA",2,22,5,3.0,8/9/2017,"Everytime I eat here, nomatter what I order, I get sick. Horrible flu stomach cramps and Hershey squirts. Y?? No idea. I come here to entertain ppl from out of town bc the menu is massive. So... Our waitress was in such a hurry, we ordered the potstickers app, I ordered my entree then my son ordered his. Bf my coworker even got a word in, she took off.  I have it 5 mins, then found another waitress and told her we still had one more entree to order. Took 10 mins b4 our original waitress came bk and finally took my co workers order. The best part about our experience was a gentlemen was introduced to our table, a server, who completely changed our experience. He was so friendly, he was Hispanic origin and that's the only way I remember him but was amazing). The rude waitress we had would have made me never come bk, but the gentlemen who took over changed it all.  Food was OK, our appetizer came out after the entrees and the potstickers were cold but we just reheated them at home.

Harry S.,"Seattle, WA",1,19,19,4.0,6/5/2016,I used to go there pretty often. But they haven't been that good lately. I don't like any of their cakes. I would rather go to some bakery for that. The food is pretty good most of the times. Just don't get a take out..it's not worth the money.

John E.,"Seattle, WA",52,182,14,3.0,12/21/2016,"The menu is challenging the Bible for it's length.   Usually when a restaurant has a thousand items to choose from, you get a wide range of mediocrity.

Amy V.,"Seattle, WA",382,65,117,4.0,5/14/2016,"To be honest, the main reason why I come here often is to just eat the brown bread and butter. lol My love for carbs is super strong and never ending. I've been here multiple times and it always gets really busy during the weekends. Your best bet is to try and wait for a table in the bar area if you're over 21. My go-to dish would be the Bistro Shrimp Pasta! It has a very lemon garlic cream flavored sauce with mushrooms and shrimp! I've tried other pastas but it never satisfied me as much as this one.  Most of the time the service is good for me, there has been some off days but that's usually when the restaurant is super packed.

Richard T.,"Bellevue, WA",151,416,15,4.0,4/27/2017,"One of my favorite chain restaurants as I always enjoy their food and the overall atmosphere of the place. This one was really busy on the day we went and the place seems smaller than the one at Bellevue Square. The menu selection is always enormous and there seems to be way too much on the menu to pick through.  It was hard to choose what to eat and I ended up picking the Pit Beef Dip sandwich which was mainly a roast beef sandwich with melted cheese and caramelized onions. The sandwich was very tasty especially after dipping in the au jus. It was flavorful and the beef wasn't overcooked as some are usually. The serving size was big as usual and I had to doggie bag some to bring home. The fries were a great side item and they had a good crunch to them from being deep fried. I also tried their key lime cheesecake which is one of my favorites as it has a good tartness to it and with the added whip cream on the side, it really complements each other. The serving size is always a good amount and there is no way I can ever finish one after a whole meal. The service here was good as we had prompt service by our waitress even though the place was totally packed and she got our drink orders out quickly. The food took a bit longer to get to us, but with how busy the place was I could understand it could take awhile. Overall a very good time here since I haven't been to this exact location in quite a few years and the place seems to have changed a bit from what I remembered since the last time I was here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=20
Holli M.,"Renton, WA",74,180,439,4.0,6/10/2017,Food was good not great. Service was good. The Alfredo and meatball my kid enjoyed very much. The Renee's special sandwich was good. Usually comes with soup but not in the mood for potato soup so they substituted for fries - that was nice. Salad with vinegarette dressing was good but they overdressed it. The salad was good - Applebee's is better but still flavorful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=20

I do advise to try and get at table at the bar, for those over 21.  The food I usually order have been great! I usually order the Cajun Chicken Littles, and sometimes I'll switch it up and order the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. So GOOD!

Marian D.,"Seattle, WA",46,48,146,3.0,5/17/2017,"Ahhh Cheesecake. I frequented this place in my youth and by that I mean age 17-21. Peach Bellinis are delicious as always, don't drink em too fast or you'll get a brain freeze!  Family dinner tonight, my parents both got the crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp that is currently on their special menu and both enjoyed it. They said it had the right amount of sweet and spicy with the pineapple balancing the dish out.  My husband ordered the chicken gumbo, but said he's had better. I ordered the chicken pot pie from the skinnylicious menu and it was alright. It didn't come out in original pot pie form but rather a bowl with chicken, peas, carrots, cream and then a small piece of puff pastry on top.  The real rock star was the calamari as an appetizer.

Mas A.,"Renton, WA",226,23,,3.0,1/1/2018,"This is actually one of my go to spots. Food is always great and service has never been an issue. The wait time is a given, this place is popular with good eats. They estimate a longer wait but generally I've always been seated sooner. Recently, it seems that this place has really gone down in service. I wonder if some of these servers are even trained. We got sat in the Octagon aka the forgotten section. We asked Brandon to bring out the appetizer before the main course (this is actually a no brainer) however he explained that how the system works is, you put in the order and it all comes at the same time. Made no sense to me as I've waited before and I know that you can time your courses. He never put in the order for the appetizer so it never came anyway. Steak was well done and not medium-well as ordered. Pasta was Luke warm. It was probably sitting for a while. We would have told the server this had he come back to do a quality check. He pawned us off to another waitress who was just as bad. I looked around our whole section and everyone seemed to be having a poor experience. Lesson learned, don't get sat in the octagon. You won't get bread service, water service, any service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=20

We ended up at this location because it was the only restaurant that was open without a lot of patrons. We ended up eating in the bar area in order to get seated quickly. The food and drinks were great, but the service was eh. The server herself appeared to do her best. She had told us that she generally does not work in the bar area, which was fine.

I've never gotten much more than an eye roll and one of them is on her phone behind the register while running people's debit cards. Really not comfortable with that ever.

My flight was delayed 6 hours so I hoped over to the Cheesecake at SouthCenter for some much needed fuel before the grueling wait. I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a number of times in the past and like every other CF, the food is consistently good!   My favorite part of the restaurant is the Rotunda-styled dining area out back... a two story vaulted ceiling with booths organized in a circle.   Tonight I ordered the kale salad to start and the Thai glazed salmon for dinner.... as always, excellent.  The portions are always generous and food FRESH - I honestly think it has something to do with the sheer volume of patrons and the food turnover being so high.  This was the best time of night to come 10:30pm on a Sunday - service was super quick and the food was out quick and hot off the grill.  Another great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=20

My favorite items go to items are the avocado spring rolls and the fish and chip plate. But the real reason I go to The Cheesecake Factory is ultimately for the mango coconut cheesecake.

Things taste slightly different.   I hope they do some major quality repair before it runs into the ground or becomes an applebees.  Service isn't always great here either. Had a bad/rude experience with a MANAGER over curbside pickup or whatever they call it.   If you ask for specifics for your order they don't follow direction/accommodate.  I really argued with her over wanting extra of the tomatillo sauce that goes with the sweet corn tamale cakes.

Kelsy T.,"Renton, WA",0,11,5,3.0,12/28/2017,"Like: rose-colored glasses that don't work anymore  When we first went to Cheesecake Factory, there were these sorts of expectations surrounding it. It is a bit pricey ($7ish for a bowl of strawberries??) and so we've always thought of it as the kind of place you'd go to for special occasions. The look of it all also made it seem a bit more high-end than your average American restaurant.  If you looked at the menu, there are an abundance of choices ranging from pasta to seafood to steak. There are even Asian choices that my little Asian self was kind of wary of. As time went on however, like those rose-colored glasses, it didn't seem as high-end as it used to.  I think there's this sort of feeling you get when you find yourself in a space where you've already painted a picture of it in your mind. Since I thought of Cheesecake Factory as this high-end, for special occasions, kind of place, no matter how the food tasted, that thought still stuck. But once you grow older, you realize that it can't always be like that.  Mind you, there are a lot of good food at Cheesecake Factory. The sliders are pretty good and their New Orleans Shrimp was a fave.  But then there is the buffalo chicken tenders that looked as if they hastily threw on some sauce while leaving some with barely any of it. There is the Steak Diane that wasn't necessarily bad but left some to be desired and the Chicken Bellagio that was kind of bland? Among a few more, there is also the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta with pasta that wasn't cooked enough and a strand of fettuccine here with another penne there.   The cheesecake in which this restaurant is famously named, is great, but the size of it grows relatively smaller with what seems like every visit. In contrast, the price sees an increase. I'm not sure if it's worth it and don't buy a cheesecake every time anymore.  I'm sure one can find a dish that they like at Cheesecake Factory but with all the things we've tried, I can't say it leaves much in the desire to try new things.  It's still expensive for a restaurant to frequent often so I wouldn't recommend it if you were looking for a cheap place to eat at and I would just say that it is really just your average American restaurant (with a wider open space). Recommended for: generally anyone for the first time, I recommend you try it out at least once. Who knows? You might find that there is one dish that will keep you coming back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2
Charles F.,"Kent, WA",210,1,,1.0,12/21/2017,"Thought this was an ok place but stay away from curbside to go. Waited an hour to get my order when it was only a 25min wait originally. Called in saying I'm here and they said only like 10-15 mins left and I sat there for an hour upon arrival. Paid my order after waiting for someone and the guy said it will be out shortly. Then a girl comes up saying if they could offer a discount cause the food was still not done but I told them I already paid, how am I going to get a discount? Not only that, she didn't even know i paid. Then she offered free cheese cake and didn't come back till 15 mins later with my food. Off I went to later find out I didn't even get cheesecake.

Knowing you're going to order appetizers, drinks, entrees, and desserts because you haven't consumed anything but caffeine for the past 10 hours? Hoping not to stress your waitress because you empathize with her long work hours? We were that couple a couple nights ago.  I'm not one who enjoys browsing a 100+ item menu, so I ordered from the designated Specialties list crafted specifically for people like myself. The crunchy pineapple chicken and shrimp was the best choice I'd made all day. I was once again a pest with the waitress and asked for a ""no cilantro"" accommodation which made the dish perfect. I couldn't see myself enjoying the mounds of fresh basil alongside it. My fiancé's grilled salmon was cooked to perfection, and the sautéed spinach along side it was a nice touch.

Reba H.,"Renton, WA",245,133,419,2.0,10/27/2017,"For the last three years my husband and I have dined at the Cheesecake Factory with our children because it has been a kid-friendly restaurant. Recently we noticed a shift in the service. Unfortunately, the wait staff seems to be getting younger and more inexperienced. I am not kidding when I tell you what happened to us last night. Hold on to your seat. So yesterday my family and I came to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner. I guess you can also call it an escape from the kitchen for a night. Well we arrived at the Cheesecake Factory around 7pm to the usual 20-minute wait. That went by pretty quickly considering the first bathroom trip with two children. When we were seated we ordered our food pretty quickly we're familiar with the menu. There is a lot of options at this restaurant heads up. I would recommend if it's your first visit check out the website and get an idea of what you want to order before you show up because there are many many options. We ordered the spicy nuggets and grilled cheese with bacon for appetizers. I wouldn't recommend either one of those to be honest. Then we ordered side salads, the countryside side catfish, and a pasta for my husband. The catfish was okay, tastes a little bit like chicken but it was a decent dish. My husband's pasta noodles are sticking together in a seriously huge clump and served a bit cold as though it had been sitting and waiting for a long time. One of the servers knocked my glasses off of the table spilling it into my lap and then crashing it down to the floor and breaking into pieces and cutting my ankle. After this occurred the server walked off and said let me grab my manager. My husband's response was to ask him for a Band-Aid and a cloth before doing so. The manager came and sort of checked out our moods I believe to see if we were going to cause a big fuss about it. Which we weren't we have children we understand that accidents happen. They gave me a Band-Aid and took my drink off the order. Which I was puzzled about. It was polite for them take the drink off the bill, however, I'm sitting there with my ankle bleeding and my lap wet and it didn't seem as though this was anything out of the usual for them. It was very odd it seemed as though they have issues like this all the time because it was kind of just back to business as usual. No fuss at all. And I don't remember a time I've ever gone out to a restaurant and left bleeding with a Band-Aid. It was just an interesting night to say the least but we've decided not to come back. I make a slammin dessert and it's just a mess there.

Christopher N.,"Seattle, WA",71,68,84,3.0,10/25/2017,"I reference how I'm not that smart often, and now I'm going to tell you a story on how I know this. A few years ago a coworkers's wife sent him to work with a cheesecake. She's an amazing cook/baker/all around kitchen whiz, so it was delicious. Now, I've always loved cheesecake from the Jello instant to something you'd get at a high end bakery. I innocently asked him how its made, and to my shock (and disgust) I learned the filling is made with cream cheese. I was floored. It was like my head was getting sucked into a black hole. I thought the ""cheese,"" in the name was a play on words. Plus, I never considered cream cheese to be cheese. Its a man made product much like Chili's Burger Meat (shots fired). I've never looked at or had cheese cake since. Its rather quite tragic. In fact, thinking about it is bringing back bad feelings. Is it happy hour yet? I went to The Cheesecake Factory ten years ago in California. Because i'm dumb, I ate hot pasta, outside, on a blazing day that made it less than memorable. I think Seattle's dark, and rainy days is a more apt setting. Isn't it cuffing season, so we're allowed to start putting on a few pounds? With that said, I've never really  had a high opinion about the joint. I always thought it was a chain restaurant that dumb people go to thinking that they're getting fine dinning. Well, friends visited recently, and they insisted on going. I can call them dumb, cause I know they don't read but in the case that they're reading this, ""One Love,"" as the great Nasir Jones once said. I was pleasantly surprised to some extent on our visit. The main entree was pretty good (Four Cheese Ravioli/Pasta). Generously portioned, very cheesy, and the sauce was pleasant. We also ordered two appetizers that were less than memorable. One was what I assumed was going to be an empanada, but was more a breaded cheese stick. The other was so unmemorable that I even forget what it was. Don't be fooled by the name of the apps, or my words...I did eat them a couple of days later when I was drunk.  The service was great though. We sat at the bar, and the bartender/server was fast, courteous, and bagged up our leftovers like a pro. She even let me not have a giant napkin in front of me as I ensured her that I wasn't some animal who can't keep the food on the plate.  I'm on the fence with this place, but I can see why some people like it. Its good for large groups, and people who like a wide range of options. The food is decent, but nothing extraordinary. I imagine I'll probably have to take my parents here on their next visit since they're not adventurous eaters (hey, they're old, and didn't grow up watching Bourdain taint their minds, and pallets). Its a solid option if you're in the area, so I won't judge...too much. Salute!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2

His was way closer to well done and mine was still a little pink. We both ordered different steaks so either the waitress or the cook goofed. At least the appetizers were good. I didn't want to complain we just finished our food day left. I didnt feel like waiting for them to re do everything since it was busy and we had to wait a while already.

Liz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",431,506,2328,3.0,4/16/2015,"Cheesecake Factory, specializes in cheesecake but offers a giant menu of entrees to choose from. I think it's easy for Cheesecake Factory to not have superb food because it doesn't necessarily specialize in one specific cuisine. It offers anything from pizza, burgers, salads, pastas, seafood, chicken dishes, etc. Despite having a huge menu selection, I still had a decent time here with my brother. We came around 5:30 on a Thursday evening and were seated right away. Around 6 pm is when a bunch of people started coming in and a line started to form so I recommend coming before 6 if you can. It gets even more crowded on Friday and weekend nights.  Mai tai - This is one of their most popular drinks. It's garnished prettily with a pineapple, orange slice and cherry. Make sure to stir the drink thoroughly. It has a nice ""tropical"" taste without tasting too much like fruit. You can taste the alcohol in here quite well, so if you like drinks that really mask the flavor of alcohol, I wouldn't recommend this one.  Fried calamari - For an appetizer we started with the calamari. It comes with two sauces: a garlic aioli type sauce and a cocktail like sauce. I think I preferred the garlic one over the cocktail one. The cocktail one seemed like it was missing a component in it, because the flavor just didn't deliver all the way. It tasted a bit more on the ketchup side. The garlic one was pretty good though. The calamari itself was just decent. The breading falls off too easily and it could have been fried a little longer. I think the squid wasn't very fresh, but the place doesn't specialize in seafood so I guess you can't expect the highest quality. Shepherd's pie - I've always heard of this dish and I've seen how it's made so it was finally time to try it. The dish is made up of ground beef, zucchini, carrots, and onions. It's then topped with mashed potatoes with a cheese ""crust."" The whole thing is smothered in mushroom gravy. Thankfully the mushroom gravy was not overly salty - which I appreciated. The mashed potatoes were tasty and I liked the cheese. It wasn't overly cheesy, which I had expected it to be. The ground beef was pretty dry though. Getting big chunks of dry beef wasn't that pleasant. Overall, the dish kind of tasted like salisbury steak. Huge portion, couldn't finish the entire thing. Spicy chicken chipotle pasta - My brother got this dish and enjoyed it. The pasta was cooked to al dente and I like the use of mini penne so that the sauce gets into the center. The sauce had a nice kick, but I felt like it was missing some sort of component that combined all the flavors together. The asparagus pieces and the little crunchy wonton strips add great texture to the dish. There are pieces of honey glazed chicken, but I think there were only around 3-4 pieces in the dish. It was decent, but could have been better. Another giant portion. White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake - It was pretty good, but ever since having cheesecake from The Confectional, it doesn't compare. It wasn't as rich and creamy and velvety. However, the raspberry flavor was swirled beautifully in the cheesecake and it wasn't overly sweet. I didn't feel like my stomach was going to cave in from richness or anything. The chocolate crust added just enough chocolate to the cheesecake and went well with the white chocolate cheesecake base. Overall, a good dessert to end our meal. Service was good and attentive. Our waiter checked up on us, gave us lots of time and was very friendly. Not sure what service looks like on the weekend, but it was awesome tonight. The dishes are all around $15, but the portion sizes are huge so it may match their price. Cheesecake slices are around $8 per slice, but are also a pretty big slice that you can easily share. You also get free bread (dark bread and sourdough), which is a nice plus.

All he had to offer is a cheesecake!!! For goodness sake how hard is it for you to have just comped the mistake. It's what good customer service should have been. To wait almost two hours is unacceptable. On top of that my friend ended up losing her appetite and not eat it. You just lost a loyal customer and more . Thank you for your less than stellar customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=60

Basically a burned hamburger patty cut up and tossed with shredded veggies in a mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes put on top. Bummed because I've always heard good things. For the comment left by Business Manager, I did say something to my waiter about the food being subpar. He chose to ignore that when I said I didn't want to order something else and still charge full price without telling the manager.

Reese R.,"Grand Rapids, MI",72,1,,1.0,2/7/2017,"Great service, our waitress was nice chatted with us told us her favorite dish on the special menu. (Which was confusing, why two different special menus?)  They were afraid to give us as much bread as we could eat while waiting for our entrée. However, when we got our food. The first bite of my Burger I was concerned my food was even fresh. The mac n cheese Burger was bland. I tasted more char from the grill then the mac n cheese. Opening the burger up the mac n cheese that was deep fried was not even close to warm it was in a purgatory of temperature. The burger was slightly warmer. But still not hot nor fresh. On the other hand my boyfriends chicken riesling was hot and had to wait for it to cool down before he could even touch it. Disappointed in the kitchen staff for not know how to get orders put together. Also it's 9:30 at night and dead.

The wait to be seated was fine, but the timeliness from our waiter was less than decent. We were never offered drink or water refills, nor did our waitress offer bread while we waited for our food. A food runner delivered our food, and immediately we realized we were missing items. The staff didn't apologize, but at least we got our food. The three cheese pasta and Thai wraps were good, but we were particularly disappointed in the $7 asparagus, which is advertised as ""grilled,"" but had simply been boiled and thrown on a plate without seasoning, butter, or any flavor all. We also asked for some sides that never came, and by the time our waitress returned to our table it was pointless to remind her, as we had been there for nearly two hours, and were ready to leave.

We needed something still open when our flight got in and we saw on Yelp that Cheesecake Factory stays open late...hello late night carb load.  I haven't been to one of these since I found out I had a gluten allergy so I didn't know what to expect. I was really pleased to see they have gluten free pasta and even have several sauces to choose from. They actually have a pretty impressive gf menu in general. Atmosphere is nice, as are all Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The lighting is low and the decor vibrant and stimulating. This particular location was pretty loud this night do to a large party but they put us in a quieter section which was appreciated. Our server was very prompt and attentive even though he seemed very busy and possibly stretched a little thin.  I ordered the chicken carbonara and my guy had the chicken parmesan. Food came out quickly and both of us were really pleased with our meals. My pasta was prepared well and didn't leave me wanting for anything, regardless of being gf. Portions are large here and we took some back to the hotel. Price is consistent with the chain as was the ambiance.

Mark C.,"Auburn, WA",0,9,,1.0,9/6/2017,"My wife and I have come to the Tukwila Cheesecake Factory nearly monthly for the past 10 years and today was our worst experience in 10 years. We ordered ribeye steak and it was delivered lukewarm to our table. We asked for a manager and requested that the our food be warmed up. The manager returned with our plate and the steak was warmer and  our mash potatoes and vegetables were cold. I asked again for the manager and requested again that they warm up our entire plate. I could not understand how they managed to bring out our food cold after we asked them to warm up our food. The manager demonstrated very little empathy and was overly serious and seemed to be just going through the motions. He could at least have acted like he cared about our negative experience,however, he never apologized for our substandard restaurant experience. I understand that Cheesecake Factory is the 9th largest restaurant chain in America, however, the culture has changed at the Southcenter Tukwila location. Customer service used to be top priority at this location, however, this does not seem to have the same priority as before.

Rumbullion R.,"Lancaster, CA",10,9,49,4.0,1/15/2016,"High: Incredible service from servers & crew.  Quality food, expedited quickly. Low: Small foyer/waiting area.  Food was a bit greasy.            This place seemed unusually busy for a Tuesday night when we ate here. But I was told that this was normal. With that said, I wish they had a better way/system for their customers to wait. The foyer where the customers are expected to wait is incredibly small & with the cheesecake bar sits right beside it, so it makes waiting a little clausterphobic. Though the front of the house wasn't rude-she was actually prompt and was making sure her tables were seating-she just didn't look happy to be there. Once we were seated though our sever was very quick, prompt and genuine. Additionally, when we needed extra bread, additional fork, etc., we flagged down the closest passing server/busser and they were all very eager to get our needs taken care of. The sense of urgency I felt the employees had made me feel important, regardless of the fact that they had a packed house. Our food came out shockingly fast considering how busy they were. All of the food tasted very good with American-sized portions, which made up for the higher prices. The pasta was good, but could've been a little more al dente. But I must admit that it was a little greasier than I had hoped.  Overall I would say that my experience at Cheesecake Factory was a pleasant one & will more than likely be returning to try out their other menu items...that tiramisu cheesecake was calling my name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=80

chris D.,"Seattle, WA",2,8,,2.0,7/12/2017,"Tonight was one of the worst experiences, and all I was doing was picking up MY wallet that I had left there. I had picked up 2 slices of cheesecake 20 minutes prior. On my way home I realized that I had left my wallet at the counter where you get the cheesecakes and the to go orders. I called the restaurant and said I would be on my way to get it. This was at 4:45 p.m. I walked into the restaurant at 5 p.m. there was a line but it wasn't as busy as they usually get, either way I was here to pick up an item that I left and had called ahead for.  I went up and told them I had called about my wallet that I had left and was told that it would be a moment. Ok no problem.  15 minutes later cut to me watching three 2 tops, one 3 top and a baby, one true 4 top and then a 9 top get seated! We NOW have a problem. I approached the hostess stand. She looked me in the face and asked if she could help me. I told her that I could come back for my wallet tomorrow if that would help them out. Then the light bulb went on and she remembered. She told me a manager had to go and get it. I said great! She never told the manager because I saw him run into the bar, mess with the seating chart system, share a joke with a group that wanted to sit outside, run over to the bakery counter side then back to the hostess stand then over to a section with the servers. I have worked in restaurants and have owned a bar. I understand how hectic change of shift coupled with ""happy hour"" can be, but I also know that I need to treat paying and already paid customers the same. Like they matter!!  After another 10 minutes when the 8 top got seated that is when I glared at the hostess and mouthed ""wallet"".  Only then did she run over to the manager. I ran out to my car to get my phone and call the corporate office. When I walked back into the restaurant the manager had my wallet and ""thanked"" me for waiting. I am not an idiot I know that going to a cheesecake factory means waiting to get seated, waiting to order and waiting to eat, but when I call ahead of time for a left item there should be little to no wait!

Roxanne W.,"Auburn, WA",49,10,3,1.0,12/4/2016,"Okay long review here, but honestly you have to know how I originally viewed this restaurant to get an idea of how disappointed I am. The first time we ate @ CF I ordered their Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and my husband ordered the Steak Diane & herb crusted salmon combo. LOVED IT!!! It was amazing and perfect! This was at the Seattle location in 2008. Following this wonderful experience we visited the Tukwila Location (it's closer to home). The first visit to TL was great! Semi same customer service, food was awesome, everything was great! We have brought tons of family and friends to CF over the last 8 years and there were times that the meal didn't have enough sauce or wasn't cooked correctly, but typically the issues have been little with no need to complain. We would chalk it up to them being busy or it was an accident kind of thing. (I get the same thing every time though, so I know how it's supposed to taste...)  My previous visit I got my food to go. Got home, ate my meal, and went to take a long awaited bite of my amazing cheesecake. As I pulled the first fork-full away it was still connected by a hair baked into the cheesecake! YUK! I thought awe man!!! And I kept it in our fridge for a good 2-3 weeks thinking I was going to make time to bring it in and show them that it was actually coming out of the cake itself. But I never got around to going and figured I would just say something about it when I went in next. When we got there is when I told the gal that my cheesecake had hair in it last time I took a to-go cake. Her response was to ask if I called in and as I said no and started to explain to her my reasoning. She interrupted me and said I wish you would have called. At that point I just asked for a manager. Who wants to pay $7-$9 for a piece of cheesecake and throw it in the garbage!?!?!? NOT ME!!!! When the manager gets to the table she says the same thing, of course, that the waitress said. And says to call next time. Doesn't want to listen to what I have to say, but sure does want me to listen to her....  She says, 'The reason we ask for a call right away is so we can 'coach' our people and if they aren't wearing a hair net when working then we can make sure they do in the future. I'll go ahead and comp one for you today, but we could have sent you another piece right away if you would have called.'  I said, 'Oh that's awesome! I wasn't aware that they would have mailed one out. Okay, that makes sense. I will call next time. Didn't think it was that big of a deal.' (She then INTERRUPTS me and says something while also mentioning that their cheesecake is not baked in house.) My response to that was, 'how are you going to coach someone that doesn't work for you? I believe I have the same gift card that I used to purchase my meal and cheesecake with me if you would like to use the paper trail to figure out who was working that day, but it doesn't matter because it was baked into the cheesecake it wasn't on the cheesecake.' Terrible customer service. Neither of these two ladies expressed any empathy to finding hair in my food. I have worked in customer service for 12 years. I know how it can be and I give the benefit of the doubt more often than not. But yesterday was the last straw. **We will NEVER GO TO THE TUKWILA ONE AGAIN!!!!** 12/3/16 marks the SECOND time (in a row) that I've gone home with leftovers that I pulled hair that IS NOT FROM ONE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS out of my food!!!! I am beyond irritated that I drove 45 minutes to spend $75 to eat dinner with these outcomes: Waited over an hr AT the table for our food, after waiting over 30 mins for a table. Which I would have overlooked, however, my husbands steak and potatoes came out 'luke warm' and now I have to throw mine away AGAIN! Even after all that we still gave a 20% tip!! There was no hair in my food when it arrived at the table. I will chalk up the problem to letting the waitress take my food back to the kitchen to stick it in the to go container.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=80

I always request that they split my pasta in 2 plates. This way my boyfriend can have his own plate while I attempt to save room for dessert... but still half a portion of the pasta made me full so I ended up taking my cheesecake to go.

Brittany S.,"Seattle, WA",0,27,5,2.0,10/19/2016,"Let me start out by saying, our food & drinks were amazing. We had avocado egg rolls for an appetizer. My husband had the chicken and biscuits for dinner, while I had the Renee's special. We also took 2 pieces of cheesecake home. If I could rate only the food and drinks it would have been 4-5 stars. Our service was absolutely terrible. Here is what we endured. It was our anniversary and we were sure going to celebrate like it was. Especially because we both work 12 hour days, go home to two wonderful kids and this mama is also in school. I asked my husband to grab a table in the bar and I would be over in a minute. When I came into the bar he was sitting down at a table instead of the high top. I asked him if he asked to sit there and he said ""Yes. I asked the server if it was okay if we seat ourselves here since a table opened up. He said it was okay and to let the host know. So, I did."" About 5 minutes later our server comes to the table and lectures us on how to be properly sat. Mind you, my husband had just had a conversation with him prior and what baffled me most is, it was 4:40 in the afternoon! And, the bar was only half full. The restaurant was nearly empty. I worked at one of the busiest restaurants in downtown Seattle for 5 years, I understand how to ask the host to be seated at a table, we aren't idiots. However, we brushed it off and ordered drinks.This was STRIKE ONE.. About 10 minutes later he comes back to the table, I ask if we can order an appetizer and bread. He responds, ""Well, I haven't even made it to the kitchen yet or I would have grabbed some."" His eyes rolled so far into the back of his head, I thought he was going to pass out. Now, I'm starting to get irritated. STRIKE TWO. We had planned to move into the restaurant at this point but he came back with what we thought was an attitude check and some bread. About an hour and so later I asked to order my 4th glass of wine. Mind you, my third one was still full but I wanted to get it at happy hour price before happy hour ended. The server looks at me in shock, as if i'm belligerent at the table and says, ""Well, who is driving!?"" I pointed to my husband. As the server walked away I nearly burst in to tears. I rarely ever enjoy myself like this but it was our anniversary, I wasn't driving. To the server, i'm sorry if it baffles you I can drink a whole bottle of wine in an evening and still be responsible. STRIKE THREE. My husband went to talk to the manager who completely BRUSHED OFF his frustrations and said, ""I'm sorry. He's kind of an awkward guy but hes been here a long time."" Nothing like, ""Let me grab you another server and take care of some of your bill."" ""How can I fix this for you?"" ""I'm so sorry. I will speak with him about this privately, immediately."" The manager said it is protocol to make sure someone isn't drunk driving, which I have zero issue with. If he would have said, ""Maam, it is protocol that I make sure after drink ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,910"" you aren't driving or order you a cab."" STRIKE FOUR. After working in the service industry for 5 years, I found this service one of the worst i've received. There was numerous eye rolling, judging, frustrations, ext. But, I don't have the time to write out every single thing that happened in our 2.5 hours of dining. Over 100.00 bill. And, I wish we would have just eaten at Subway!

For a premium price, and possibly half a chicken breast worth of chicken... 86 it off your giant menu if your not gonna put the effort into making it properly.  The other item I got was steak tacos.

Gerald L.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,2,,1.0,8/17/2017,"This has got to be the worst restaurant in the world. My friends and I went to the restaurant earlier today to celebrate a birthday and an anniversary. We went there just as they opened their doors, thinking we would be seated and served immediately. Well, think again. The restaurant just opened. It was empty. We were one of the first people in the door. You would think we would be seated right away. But NO. TCF has a policy of not seating people if they did not have enough servers. Not enough servers as they opened their doors. They should not open the restaurant if they were not fully staffed. We had to stand around and wait 30 minutes for enough servers to be seated. Just to be seated, mind you. Not even to be served. I have never heard of such a ridiculous policy. We had tried to make reservations, but were told they did not take reservations. At the restaurant, we were asked if we had made reservations. We were advised to make reservations  if there were so many people in our party. It was as if they did not want our business or even cared if we gave them our business. There are a bazillion restaurants to go to. There is nothing special about The Cheesecake Factory that I could see or discern. Given that it is a popular restaurant.  We were treated like unwelcome guests. I am never going to The Cheesecake Factory ever again - even if someone else was picking up the bill. The food is adequate. Nothing spectacular. What a great disappointment. I would have given it zero stars if at all possible. One star is the lowest. NOT RECOMMENDED. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME OR TREATED AS VALUED GUEST. YOU ARE TREATED MORE LIKE PESTS. Go to any other restaurant. I have never had this kind of service at any restaurant.

The hostess led us to the bar and kindly asked a couple to move down a seat so we could sit comfortably at the bar together. We ordered a drink, which was delicious. I always order a Blue Hawaiian wherever I go and it was made perfectly.  We waited about 15 minutes or less for our food. I ordered a nice bowl is spaghetti with red meat sauce. Let me tell ya, it was AMAZING. It came with a nice, big serving and garnished with a dehydrated and DELICIOUS basil leaf and the sauce was incredible. If you're craving spaghetti, and can't make it yourself, this is the place to go!

I used to always get the Chicken Bellagio or Shrimp Scampi, and never (at this location) has my food come back wrong, bad, or in any way not to standards. My waiter/waitress is always awesome, friendly, and attentive (shout out to Chris, she's awesome.) Now that I'm vegetarian, I try some different pasta dishes when I come here. So far my favorite is the tomato basil pasta with no chicken. All of their dishes are very flavorful and filling. They have huge portions for the prices on the menu. It can be a little loud, but that's because it's always busy. It's good for kids and it's great for a date night or just a dinner stop on your way home (they have a car side to go program.) For dessert, they have 2 full pages of different kinds of cheesecake to choose from. You can always come here and have a complete unique dining experience every time. The slices of cheesecake are fair in size and perfect for sharing. If you aren't a Cheesecake person, they have other kinds of cake and ice creams and pies to choose from as well.

Well, we didn't see her for nearly 20 minutes and our meals were brought out (not by the waitress) before she came back with the bread. A few minutes after our meals were delivered, she brought out our bread. We are never going to say no to bread, but it would've been nice to have it before the meal. After she delivered the bread, she checked in with us only once and then we didn't see her again for close to another 20 minutes when she asked how we wanted our checks divided.

Nam N.,"Renton, WA",677,804,135,4.0,2/4/2016,"I've been a frequenter of TCF since their first opening back in 2002-03 when they came to Bellevue Square.  I was invited to a soft opening and have always been impressed with the quality of food as well as the service. This location is nothing short of par of a standard for chain restaurants.  When I do stop by and there's an extensive wait I'll either attempt to sit in the bar area (first come first serve) or I'll just leave so the wait has never bothered me.  I pick the right days (avoid weekends and no school nights) to visit and I'm typically sat within 5 minutes or less so that helps with my experience.  Considering I've been coming to TCF locations up and down the west coast for the past 13 years, the menu isn't daunting to me because I know what I want already, which helps.  Because if you are new - the menu is very much overwhelming with too many options for the indecisive to decide.  The have everything from every kind of pasta to beef carpaccio, vietnamese spring rolls to steak diane, mango salads to firecracker shrimp.  If that isn't enough to confuse you what to get, you'll have two pages of different desserts to choose from. My favorite part is the honey wheat bread and butter - delicious! My go to appetizer is the Luau Salad, fresh choke full of fruits and veggies topped with mangos and chicken, it really is a meal in itself.  The ahi tuna salad is also a great choice for healthy eats.  Main course wise, I haven't had anything that I hated, the jambalaya and fettucini are good go to dishes, meatloaf and the burrito are hefty portions and good flavor that can easily be divided by two.  I will say I wasn't a fan of the nachos, only because twice I ordered it and twice it came out dry, most likely due from sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be delivered.  Desserts are a tough choice but I'd have to pick the red velvet cheesecake, not over sweet but dances with that idea, the white chocolate shavings paired with vanilla bean ice cream and it's pure bliss.  My second choice is the strawberry shortcake, towering high of ice cream, shortcake, and ice cream - you can easily share any dessert or food portion with two to three folks and still have plenty to eat. Is it the best food ever? hardly.  Is it the cheapest eats you can find? far from it.  But thanks to the consistency of service and food and my experiences here I do like the place.  And will come back, most likely sooner than later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=120

The chicken was cooked well and delicious. Of the three sauces provided, I enjoyed the peanut sauce the most. The Chicken Madeira was fantastic. The sauce and mushrooms on their own were amazing, but when paired with the cheese-covered chicken they were absolutely on point. The dish was a little under $20, but was a decent portion size. I ended the meal with a Red Velvet Cheesecake. Like all their other cheesecakes, this one was filling and delicious. They didn't overdo the frosting on the top either.

Edie S.,"Tacoma, WA",2,19,13,1.0,3/27/2017,"The description of this restaurant lies: they DO NOT take reservations.  We wanted to take my son and his family out for 4 birthdays that all happen within two weeks of each other. There were 7 ""full size"" people and a 4 month old baby. I called to make reservations and was told they didn't take them. They said the wait would probably be more than 30 minutes. Since I already told my son we would meet them there my husband and I went there to check what the wait would be. They didn't lie about the time. The parking lot and the entry to the restaurant was packed so it didn't look promising. I asked the hostess how long it would be. She wanted my name immediately, put it into the system, then I was told she had to check with the manager for how long on bigger parties. She just stood there so I said, okay are you going to check? She turned to someone else who went off toward the kitchen. I waited for several minutes more. I was never given one of the beeper things so I had to just stand there. I finally asked where the manager was and she finally turned to a man who had come into the hostess station a minute before and then he came and told me it would be 50 minutes. We decided that was too long to wait with a baby and 3 other kids under 12. I said it was very unfortunate that they don't take reservations. One hostess agreed and the manager ignored me. I made sure that he heard me. I asked if it was a store policy or corporate, and he said corporate. The corporate page says that some stores do take reservations for large parties. The manager was less than friendly. I'm sure they don't care because they are obviously busy enough but it would make for a much more enjoyable experience to be able to have a shorter wait with a less crowded waiting area if they actually did take reservations.

Thao N.,"Seattle, WA",1685,441,245,4.0,12/28/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory. For some reason this always seem to be the surprise first date spot, birthday dinners, work party, or family get together celebration. It is a safe choice, a nice atmosphere with great food without going too overboard, plus it could be a restaurant that is family friendly for kids. They have a huge menu, it's pages and pages of options ranging from typical american dishes like steak, pasta, and burgers to Mexican and Asian fusion. Some of my favorite appetizers are the avocado eggrolls and Thai lettuce wraps. I heard the fried mac & cheese are a popular choice, but it might be too fattening for my taste. They didn't call it Cheesecake Factory for no reason, the cheesecake options are a menu itself. I've never seen this many choices, you have to try the red velvet cheesecake. If anything, the New York Style cheesecake is always a classic to have if you aren't adventurous in trying new things. You have complimentary bread when dining in, there's 2 kind that they give you;brown and white and let me tell you the brown is the shit, I think it's chocolate flavor. The best part? UNLIMITED bread, but don't get too hooked to it, you still need room for your food. All the entree seems to be huge portions so yay leftovers! Weekends and dinner time are always going to be busier, they don't take reservations on weekends. Watch out for homecoming or prom season because there tend to be large parties on the waiting list so that might delay your wait time. I was there when I was in grade school, it sucks on this end too to have to wait 2 hours to get a table that will hold that big of a party.

Josh B.,"Lacey, WA",256,907,6237,3.0,11/29/2014,"Sigh....I really want to give this Cheesecake Factory more than 3 stars, but I simply cannot. There are a lot of positives but the one negative that I will explain below really put a damper on the entire experience.  It's hard for me not to like Cheesecake. They are usually always busy in the restaurant area as well as the pickup and cheesecake counter. So, it's popular and slightly trendy.  They have at least 8-12 pages on their menu with a lot...and I mean A LOT of options for practically every diet or set of taste buds. I'm not sure how many of the items are gluten-free though so I would check the menu online before you come. There were a lot of options for myself as a vegetarian, so I was happy about that.  They usually set you up with some warm bread and butter while you wait and skim the menu, but don't eat too much bread because usually the portion size for your entrée is quite large so your eyes need to be as big as your stomach.  I opted for a Veggie Burger as I wasn't feeling like one of the many pastas that I could have eaten. It was actually a good size but basically fell apart as it is mainly made of brown rice and black beans. It would have been better without a bun since the bun didn't serve it's purpose of holding the burger. The burger was also lacking in flavor which was kind of odd since it was basically homemade and some spice or grill flavor could have been added to raise the basic burger up a notch or two.  I didn't opt for cheesecake this time as I didn't want to be too stuffed for the ride home, although most of their cheesecakes are pretty original and very good.  Now to the one item that really stuck in my craw. We went around 7 or 8 in the evening. Understandably, the ambience is suppose to be a little more romantic or intimate with how dimly lit the place was. Seriously though, it was SO dark that we could not see the menus without squinting. We all had to actually take out our cell phones to shed light on the subject. I actually went into the bathroom with the menu because there was more light in there to see. Also, it's hard to see your food when it's so dark and I like to see what I'm eating as sight is a part of the experience of eating along with smell, touch, taste, and even sound. Also if I can see what I'm eating I can tell if it's undercooked or has hair in it or something else. All I'm saying is it would have been nice to have a lamp or light directly on the table or maybe even a faux candle that would brighten up things without sacrificing the intimate feel of the experience.  I will be back to this Cheesecake Factory, but during the daytime. Also, parking can be a little hectic too since it's right outside the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=120

The menu is overwhelming and comes in a spiral bound booklet. The food is what you'd expect from somewhere that serves everything and the kitchen sink - just okay. They're so busy working on quantity that quality suffers.  Service is absent. We were there about 4 hours (not entirely by choice, service is sllloooww) and we were never really checked on. It took forever to place orders and receive them. I saw plenty of staff walking past the table, but no one actually helped us. The times we did receive service it was friendly.  I ordered a margarita (which is served straight up) and received a martini. *sigh* I'm not into gin, but it took so long to receive (~40 min) that I opted to just put up with it, it's was okay (until I keep the price in mind, not worth it!!).  The food is nothing to write home about and it's also overpriced. The burger I ordered had a soggy bun and was so greasy I could only eat half before I felt bogged down for the rest of the evening.

Joni K.,"Seattle, WA",430,108,1971,1.0,8/24/2015,"My family and I had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory (Tukwila, WA location) for my cousin's 30th birthday Sunday, August 9th. We arrived around 7:30pm, and since the dinner crowd had died down, we were seated after about a 10 min wait which wasn't bad. We had seven (7) people in our party and three (3) of them were hungry children.  While the dinner rush was dying down, we literally saw our server at our table perhaps three (3) time out of the entire meal (twice I had to go to the front to track him down). We literally waited ten (10) minutes for our waiter to come take our drink order. Then we waited another fifteen (15) minutes for our drinks and starter bread. By that time, the kids were whiny and hungry.  Our dinner entrees took a long time to arrive so when it finally did, we were each excited as we were famished. I'm medically diagnosed as gluten-free and become highly ill when I am exposed to gluten. Therefore, when I placed my order, I communicated this to our waiter. He assured me that both mine and my spouse's gluten-free pasta dishes would be safe and explained that the dish would be served with a fusilli (corkscrew-like) pasta noodle. When our food arrived and after taking several bites of my gluten-free carbonara, I was highly disappointed to find that there was a spaghetti noodle in it. I tracked our server down and explained that since it was my cousin's birthday, I didn't want to cause a scene but wanted to confirm if the only gluten-free noodles they were serving was in fusilli.  My waiter confirmed that the only gluten-free noodles available were in the fusilli shape which is what he had served me and my spouse. I then informed him that there was a spaghetti noodle in my gluten-free pasta which basically meant that I was exposed to gluten and would now be getting sick. At that point, he almost robotically informed me that the meal would be deducted from my meal. Despite the lack of empathy, it was a nice attempt to try to resolve the matter. However, being medically allergic to gluten, his resolution did not comfort me as I now knew that I would be getting sick due to the lack of diligence.  After I had already explained to our waiter that I didn't want to disrupt my cousin's birthday celebration, the manager then arrives at the table to inquire about the meal. I pull him to the side and again, explained that it was my cousin's celebration so I'd prefer to speak with him away from the table. At that point, the manager, Steven, curtly tells me that he intended to come to the table to not only follow up on the status of my gluten-free meal, but to also check on everyone else as well. Steven then proceeded to tell me that since he was now only speaking to me, he wanted to tell me that, ""The kitchen takes celiac allergies very seriously. Out of everyone in the restaurant, you're the only one who has a regular noodle in their gluten-free meal."" I found his response to me was non-empathetic and unprofessional. I informed him that I had saved the noodle on the side of my plate and that if he was insinuating I was making it up, he could verify himself. He then told me he would like to make me a new meal or give me mine free. At that point, the kids were tired and exhausted from waiting forever for service and food and we all just wanted to go home. I politely told him that we had waited forever for service and food, that I wasn't happy that I was now going to become ill due to non-gluten-free meal. I asked him to please immediately have boxes sent to our table and also the birthday treat I had previously requested them to provide to my cousin.  After waiting another fifteen (15) minutes, I went to the front and again, tracked our server and asked for our boxes and check. As I was walking back to my table, I saw another gentleman speaking to the manager, Steven. The customer was obviously upset as I heard the customer tell Steven, ""It's not even about the bad food, but no one even apologized for their mistake."" Steven was disregarding this customer as he disregarded me. I left the restaurant exhausted, sick, and hungry. My cousin left without his birthday celebration treat and proceeded to wait another twenty (20) minutes in the ""To-go Cheesecake"" line to order his own birthday cake. By the time we left, it was around 10:30pm. Overall TERRIBLE TERRIBLE experience... bad service, lack of empathy and care with client food allergies, and non-empathetic management which I'm sure which all derives from the horrible ""lead by example"" leadership style exhibited by manager, Steven. This lack of leadership teaches his team to not care for their customers. I've ate here several times in previous years and I've never had a problem. If Steven continues to lead the team at this location, this restaurant will soon be unsuccessful. As customers who understand the true value of customer service and quality of food, will find it very easy to resort to dining at the next restaurant in the busy Southcenter mall area",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=140

I took my youngest son to this place late one summer night recently, we tried the food, and we loved it.  I latter wanted to surprise my oldest son with dinner from here for his birthday,  at first he was reluctant to eat here because he had heard all of the negative comments too.  Vanessa was our server; my son was determined to give her a hard time (in a playful way); she got down to his level and played right along with him, he warmed up, and even attempted to share his food with her.  The drinks and appetizers were delicious.  There were a few hick-ups with the dinner part, but we didn't care one single bit due to how well we were being treated by Vanessa.  Life had thrown us some curve balls earlier that week, we weren't in the best of spirits, however for the time that we were there Vanessa took such good care of us, that our worries, and heartache were able to subside, and were able to be set aside our problems for even just a few hours, for us it meant more to us than just having a good server, or food.  I told her that the world needed more people like her, and it does, people like Vanessa don't come along very often, I know that I'm singing praises about her right now, but it just truly showed me what humanity was all about, and how someone can make someone else's day brighter just by smiling, engaging with them, and being kind to strangers; so I just had to give her another shout out in a review!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=140

Weather was a little hotter than usual but we opt to sit outside because there was no line and the heat isnt something we can't handle. One person got the table first, and then within 10 minutes, everyone was there and seated. The waiter/server didn't come by to offered anyone any drinks or to take appetizer order till 15 minutes later. I find that to be unacceptable. And he told us, we have to ""ask"" for bread since is no longer something that they have to give to every table. Yet after observing other server and other tables, we notice that servers are still bringing the bread to the table without being ""asked"". So what made us that special??? I also had asked for a couple extra butter and more bread. But he never came with them. Near the end of the meal, I asked him to add a loaf of bread to my order so I can take it home. He was like ""oh im sure you can get it for free and that I wont have to add it to your order."" But it was on my bill in the end. I mean, I was planning to pay anyways, but why would you suggest something or say something if you can't follow up with it.

Kristy T.,"Seattle, WA",2,38,23,3.0,10/10/2015,"I've been to this location multiple times and I love eating at the Cheesecake Factory but the wait during the evenings is so long sometimes but worth the wait. (If you come before 5:30pm on the weekends, the wait is at least 5-10mins).  The customer service at this location is a hit or a miss. Sometimes your waiter is friendly and sometimes not so much, depending on who you get. When I went yesterday, our waiter was wonderful and helpful. I believe her name was Ronnie.  Our complimentary bread, drinks and food came out at a reasonable time.  I always get the Steak Diane and strawberry lemonade and it's always good.  The steak Diane comes with mushrooms and mash potatoes. It comes with a good portion at its price.  As for the strawberry lemonade, it's the best strawberry lemonade I've ever had. They give you a reasonable amount for the price as well.  I ordered to go food towards the end for my aunt and it came out right when i received the check. Also, when our waiter came back to give us our check back, she also checked to make sure that our to go food was correct which was wonderful.

Given our menus without a word and approached 15 minutes later to ask what type of drinks wanted.

Sheri C.,"Seattle, WA",210,1826,1634,2.0,6/23/2015,"I am updating my review based on my most recent experience.  Go elsewhere for dinner. Last week, I came in to have dinner with the BFF. He told me he was there 10 minutes before I arrived. When I went to the host stand and said I was meeting someone, the hostess stared at me for a minute then said she didn't have anyone down for waiting for a guest. I asked her to look again, giving her my name and my friend's name. She acted put out and said she had nothing. I asked if I could look around. She glared at me then said fine but she knew he wasn't there. I walked around the restaurant and wasn't able to find him. I called his cell and texted him; no answer. I then went back to the host stand, gave the same girl my name and said I would like a table until I could connect with my friend. It was 5 pm on a Wednesday; a few people were waiting. She said I could wait for a table. After a few minutes, a waitress was yelling over the noise of the restaurant - it is ridiculously loud in here - ""party of 2"" over and over. No one responded because she didn't say a name. She then barreled over to me and angrily asked if I was waiting for a table and before I could answer, she demanded to know why I didn't give my name to the hostess. She showed me a ticket while doing this that didn't show a name. I said yes, I want a table and yes, I gave my name and my friend's name several times! Finally seated, I connected with my friend who told me he had put his name down for a table before going outside.  We had talked for 30 seconds when our waitress appeared, asking what we wanted to order. I told her we just sat down, give us 5 minutes. One minute later she was back. My friend hadn't opened his menu yet, telling me about his day. She came back one minute later so we both just picked something.  My friend got spaghetti and I ordered a salad. The food was just ok. The salad was a huge portion. I took half home. The waitress grabbed the plates while we were still eating, but we didn't say anything because we just wanted out of there. The point of having a meal is to enjoy your company and your food, and we couldn't do that with the constant interruptions and sheer noise due to the horrible acoustics. She dropped off the check without asking if we wanted any dessert, but again, I was happy to just go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=160

It was more of a hassle than it was worth. When my sister ordered her second glass of wine at around 10 pm, a new server came over and told her that they had to stop serving as of now because of a mechanical issue they were having in the bar. My husband called BS and ended up getting her the wine in the end. The man was very rude about it. When we got up to leave, my daughter wanted a piece of cheesecake as we walked by the counter. It was no later than 11 and the girls behind the counter let us pick one out and everything before they told us that they were no longer serving Cheesecake. An hour and a half before closing time they stopped serving cheesecake and two and a half hour before closing they stopped serving alcohol. There's nothing mechanical about pouring wine.

Karen D.,"Renton, WA",53,347,,4.0,12/18/2013,"It takes a lot for me to give a restaurant a 2nd review, especially a chain, but,  I just had to give some love to the Southcenter Cheesecake Factory.  Went here for an office dinner and drinks party to celebrate the holidays.  All I can say is wow.  For starters, there were 12 of us, and we needed the bill split up all kinds of crazy ways...it was ""separate checks"", but those of us who were there with our spouse wanted checks for 2.  Then I decided to treat the table to a bunch of appetizers.  Another person bought the wine.  One of the couples bought cheesecake slices for the table.  And so on.  Somehow our angel of a server, Michelle, managed to keep everything straight.   Michelle and the people who backed her up were just perfect. Michelle was friendly, helpful, and efficient.  Everything came out right when it was supposed to, drinks cold and food hot.  I also have to give a nod to the bartender named Ivy, as those who ordered cocktails thought her mixed drinks were divine, particularly the lemon drop, which at least 3 people at the table were swooning over, and not just from the alchohol! The food received mixed reviews from the group.  As I have noted before, Cheesecake Factory can be inconsistent in the food department. I never order pasta there because they usually overcook it for my taste.  I know what I like there, and that is the grilled salmon with sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. I usually order that and am happy.  This was no exception.  My spouse ordered the exact same thing, but unfortunately her salmon was overcooked and dry.  That's the inconsistency I'm talking about.   You generally can't go wrong with the cheesecake for dessert.  I ordered the tiramisu flavor, which I have liked in the past, but this time there was an off taste to it; just not sure why.  The reeses peanut butter cheesecake was awesome.   All in all, we had a fabulous time at the office Christmas party this year, and it had a lot to do with the wonderful service and atmosphere at the Southcenter C.F.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=200

Which I left sit on the table. I'm paying for the meal, why not LISTEN when I talk. I'm neither quiet, or easy to ignore. The server who took the order, didn't even bring it out.

I also got the original cheesecake with strawberries on top. We saved that to take back to our hotel since we were quite full. When we tried it we realized they skimped out on the strawberries a bit since there were only 3. The only issue I have is with the price of the items on the menu in this restaurant.

I was incredibly disappointed in the actual food.  Uninspired, their menu has no focus and as little a theme as the decor.   The wait is atrocious, with a standard 30 minute stand by via walk in.  To reserve requires a party of 7 and only available during certain hours.  Without a 30 minute wait, being seated within 10 minutes of walking in you can still expect a 30 minute wait to get your food, even if your order is in immediately.  I had an almost 20 minute wait on my wine, which was needed much sooner. I had the factory burger on wheat with sweet potato fries.  I ate the first half, having to soak up the very sharp and bitter red that I was sipping.  The burger was incredibly dry.  So much so that I gave half of the half of my burger that I was eating to my husband, who then slathered it with ketchup and then choked a little because it was still too dry.  How can you screw up a burger?  The fries were over done.   Dave had the meatloaf.  It would be better compared to salsbury steak rather than meatloaf.  It was covered in a dark, almost BBQ like sauce and coated below was a slather of caramelized onion.  The mashed potatoes were bland and covered with a very salty gravy.  I have found that salt in access is usually a sign of a cover up, which makes me nervous for the hubby.  He fed me a bite and offered a second and I asked him as sweetly as possible not to put anymore near me.  Ick.

Get the Louisiana Cajun pasta or another hit like the steak Diane. I usually get the Americana burger or Cajun chicken littles. Big drink menu. Strong Mai Tais and Long Island iced teas. Can be a little loud but as the night winds down this is an awesome place to go for a quiet intimate setting.  They bring two types of bread for starters. Sourdough and sweet molasses. You'll always need a to go box though since portions are huge. Bathrooms a little small same with the tvs in the bar but this isn't really a bar place.  Also if you don't like big groups by you just ask to be reseated.

We arrived about quarter to five on a Saturday evening. There was about a 45 minute wait, which turned out to be pretty close to right on.  After a few minutes of getting situated at our table we were greeted by our waitress who was quite friendly. The menu is huge!  Lots to choose from for food or (of course) cheesecake, but only three beers on draft :(. Oh well - I will drink anything with bubbles and alcohol so I made it work.  I ordered a sirloin steak for $18.99 and my wife ordered the chicken tacos. The meals came much faster than expected and the presentation of both were great. My steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and was very tasty. The fries came on a separate plate, which was a nice touch so they all stay crisp.  My wife's tacos were also very good.  The place looks a bit like a palace inside and is very inviting. It is definitely worth a visit.

Roger F.,"Seattle, WA",1,3,,5.0,9/20/2014,"Hi fellow foodies, it's Roger here I'm back with an review of the Cheesecake Factory Restaurant In Southcenter Mall! Okay let me start off by saying I had a nephew who worked here in the early 2000's so I'm a little biased to give this review because I almost feel like it's my family's own restaurant but I'll try to give a fair Everydayman's prespective. Okay now that I got that out of the way about my nephew, who worked here in the early 2000's, here is my fair, Everydayman's prespective: The Cheesecake Factory Restaurant In Southceneter Mall is in my top 10 Restaurants List, and the review book I'm currently working on (think Zagets Rating or Michelens Stars) will have a much longer in depth ""long form read"" about the ins and out of this place. It's what us on the food blog circuit call a Top Crown. I honestly wonder if the people who haven't yet given this 5 starts have a rare taste bud syndrome that's causes them to have a bad taste in their mouth. I say ""who haven't yet given its 5 stars"" because I think, if they actually DO have this so called rare taste bud syndrome and then they someday lord willing get this syndrome fixed, they when then later get this place the 5 stars it deserves. Here is a short list of things, to be fair, that I think The Cheesecake Factory Restauarant in SouthCenter Mall could improve: 1. When I visited here there menu had a breakfast section and a breakfast item called ""Factory Heuvos Ranchers"". Huevos, in case you didn't know, I think it means Eggs in Mexico. Now look, I know that the large appetite of America for Eggs means that we must use factory chickens farms in order to supply America's large appetite for Eggs, but it's awfully off putting to see it listed on their menu that the Eggs are factory made. Although I can understand that they want their consumers to know exactly where they get their Eggs, so for that I give it a Pass! When my ex wife who has since passed God bless her, would come here, she would always order the same thing, every time, like a clockwork! I can't remember what it was, but in closing, I think I'd like to quote her, if you friends don't mind, about her favorite thing about here. It's from a diary entry she wrote before she passed, and I found it while sitting out her things. I think it pretty much says it all:  ""It seems like we come here all the time and every time Roger says we're coming here, I wonder if I'd made a mistake. I always end up getting the same thing, and it's usually pretty good but...""  And then she goes on a little bit more into detail but I think what really stands out about her review is that she loves the food and most importantly she found that it was ""Always really good"" her words not mine. That, my foody friends, is what we reviewers call a one heck of a endorsement! Try out The Cheesecake Factory In South Center Mall in Tukwila near Renton, Today!

I usually grab the Farfalle With Chicken And Roasted Garlic but this time, i wanted something crunchy/fried as well and the waiter was so helpful! He recommended that i get my usual pasta but this time, substitute the regular pan seared white chicken for the Louisana style chicken.  When my pasta came? It was the most delicious pasta i ever had. The sauce was so creamy and i still can't get over how cute the pasta are bow-tie shaped!

Katie H.,"Seattle, WA",330,147,29,4.0,7/29/2014,"I am all about expectation setting, and if you have the right expectations about The Cheesecake Factory, you will have a good experience.  If you don't know what you are getting into, you probably won't enjoy your time here. Happy Things- The Cheesecake, and any dessert for that matter, is always good- ALWAYS.  My fat cells jiggle for joy when I come here because they know they are about to get some new friends.  My favorite cheesecakes are the Pineapple Upside Down, the Tuxedo, and you can never go wrong with the classic.   The portion sizes are huge.  It is true that this place is pricey, but you do get a really big portion for what you order.  Also, you can never actually eat said portion size because you will fill up on bread (and by ""you"" I mean I will fill up on bread, delicious carbs, mmmm). The food is never bad; you always know what you are going to get, and truly, that's what chain restaurants are for.  If you want an experience that is unique and tasty, don't go to a chain restaurant.  The fried mac and cheese if phenomenal, and event though it is an appetizer, I routinely get it for my meal.  Bread, fried mac and cheese, and cheesecake- perhaps this is why my jeans keep shrinking and my dryer isn't the culprit... The menu is huge, and anyone can find something tasty here.  Just keep in mind, that as a chain restaurant recipes are meant to appeal to as many tastebuds as possible.  That means that the flavors are going to be safe, but find something you like in the comfort food/Southern fare area of things, and you will probably enjoy what you get.  If you order Thai food here and expect what you are used to in the Seattle area- that is all on you, chief.  Expectations, people- you don't get good Thai from an American chain restaurant. I have never had bad service here; the wait staff is busy, but they work it!  Sometimes I have had the thought that some restaurants that are 25% full, have stationary servers, and empty customer glasses could learn a few things from The Cheesecake Factory wait staff. Sad things-  You will WAIT to come here unless you come at a weird time.  And by waiting I mean stand forever.  The lines are are sooo long.  Either be prepared to wait, or come at like 11 AM.   Price- it's not super pricey, but for what you spend here in the Seattle area, you could get something much better.  Don't expect a $15 lunch, however. Drinks- never bad, never strong, very generic.  If you want a great cocktail that is over $10, go to a bar, not The Cheesecake Factory.  The drinks are flashy, but it the bartenders are never generous on the alcohol side of things.   I have been here more than once, and I will probably be back.  Have your expectations in line, and you won't have a terrible time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=220

Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6253,4.0,10/28/2015,"Being a huge national chain, most of us who eat out often know what to expect from the Cheesecake Factory. Rest assured this location is no different than any of the others. You'll find solid service, consistent meals, quality and large portions. There's few better places for dates, celebrations, family meals or solo outings at the bar stool. This is one chain that always delivers. Why so many people give it average ratings has always surprised me. I'm guessing it's because the meals aren't dirt cheap. Meanwhile, what do you expect? With portions as big as they are and quality meals you get what you pay for. In fact, many eat half and take the rest home.  In fact, even the bread they bring to your table is better than many meals served by competitive chains, as is the passion tea. Another factory to consider is there is something for everyone here. On the other hand, a massive menu can't make it a chore to decide what to eat. There's nothing on the menu that doesn't hit the spot, and if you disagree you are one of those guests that complain about everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=180

Shane Y.,"Seattle, WA",46,176,17,1.0,3/23/2015,"I will never, for the life of me understand how this place is always busy. Its a chain restaurant that serves horrible meals at asinine prices yet the place is always full. I've been thinking about coming here for years but never wanted to deal with the crowd. Showed up at 11:00 a.m. on a Friday and decided to give it a try. I nearly instantly regretted the decision. We sat ourselves in the bar area which apparently isn't allowed, we were immediately scolded by a waitress that we weren't allowed to do that but since it was slow she would let it slide. Why inform us at all if you are going to serve us. I don't need to be told cheesecake bar-room adequate is different from the rest of the country if you aren't going to do anything about it. I apologize for seating myself at the bar, had you had a competent hostess I wouldn't have broken your unwritten bar rules. Needless to say I wasn't impressed with the service.  The food itself is what you can expect from a chain that doesn't have an executive chef. Frozen style meals heated up by minimum wage earning high school kids. A margarita pizza to them is frozen dough, with tomato sauce and a cheese stick chopped into pieces and barley melted. (Yes the same cheese sticks you buy at Safeway for your 3 year old child.) No one told them about basil apparently. Maybe you shouldn't have a menu of 200 items if you cant' remember what goes on each dish. How about specializing on 30 things you can do really well... Overall it doesn't matter morons will still dine at your establishment so whats the point of cooking good food. After lunch we waited 40 minutes with half full plates in front of us because our waitress forget about us when the lunch rush started. We expected this since she of course still blamed us for eating at the wrong table or something.  At the end of the day none of this matters. For some reason people still eat here in droves. Instead of reviewing the restaurant I should be shaming the fools that dine here. If you eat at the cheesecake factory you are disgracing American food. There are hundreds of places in the same vicinity that deserve your business. This establishment doesn't. I hope you don't make the same mistake I did and find a pleasant place to eat where the food is delicious, the staff is courteous and your hard earned dollars are supporting people that deserve it.

When I came back after 40 minutes they told me 30 minutes yet again. After almost 2 hours of eating we were seated. We knew what we were going to eat but the waiter was nowhere to be seen. We were seated for 20 minutes no water, no bread, no help at all. Finally 30-35 minutes of waiting the waiter came to our table asking what we wanted. We ordered our meals and said for dessert we want a cake. The first thing that came was our dessert. We said we wanted it later so the waiter suggested go pack it up. Which we didn't want at all. So we kept the cake on our table while we wanted for the food. Once we got our food everything was fine. Food was okay. The pizza my dad had was burnt. My brother had the Thai curry. I had the Chicken Bellagio. It tastes pretty good. Yet the service was really killing me...he was quick to give us the bill and pick it up which gave off a bad impression. I understand he might have been busy that night but giving attitude when we ask for napkins or more water pushed my buttons. I can't tolerate a bad attitude especially if me, a customer is being nice about it...not sure if I want to go back..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=180

We had a party of 6 people and it was my birthday (made very apparent by the birthday gift bag on the table.) Our waitress took our drink orders and then never came back. My mother in law flagged down a manager and he ended up taking our drink order and bringing it to us. The waitress finally returned and took our meal order, which went smooth I guess. She seemed a little bewildered when one of our family members asked for his steak rare or medium rare and her response was ""you need to pick one as I have to push a button on the computer"" ...what? Haha. When our food came, our waitress was reminded that we had a birthday at our table. She ignored the request, and also ignored my request to get a glass of water. The manager finally noticed the birthday and when our cheesecake came they brought it out on a plate that said happy birthday with a candle which I thought was a nice touch. It was irritating that our waitress was so aloof, but what made me drop my review to only 2 stars was because when my boyfriend went to eat his leftovers the next day (pasta dish with chicken), his chicken was bloody in one chunk of it. I don't mean pink, like blood was coming out of it and running down the meat. After that, I'm not sure if I ever want to eat here again unless I'm just grabbing a piece of cheesecake to go.

I had some chicken Parmesan sandwich, the bread was a bit on the hard side, there was more tomato than chicken, and the fries were coated with sodium. I  only had one bite of fries, too salty. My husband had the chicken balliagio (chicken with pesto covered noodles). My husband liked it enough but the first thing I noticed wad how oily it was. I wasn't fond of having to wipe my lips after every singly bite. The factor of the meal I enjoyed the most wad actually my server. He was very attentive to our table, answered our questions about the menu, and interacted with my party easily. I really liked how he asked us if we wanted to split our check or combine. He even gave us time to decide and asked how to split the shared appetizer, ""everyone ate some, right?"" One thing I can't stand is paying more to cover for someone else's bill. Call me picky, but I always get shafted in this area (example :paying $15 for a $5 salad when I didn't have any wine ordered for the whole table) Anyway, food was ok, service was better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=240

They are rude and very annoyed about pretty much everything you ask them during happy hour. Don't expect to go here and have a happy chat with a bartender during happy hour. It isn't going to happen. Major attitude.  Last time I was in here, I ordered spring rolls, somehow something different was ordered, and the bartender actually argued with me that was what I ordered. It was weird.

The service is mediocre and also their ladies bathroom is very small and only has 3 stalls. This is ridiculous based on their large restaurant size. Also waiting for a table is ridiculous because you would think they would have a designated waiting area instead of everyone cramming together near the entrance and you basically get trampled by everyone else waiting.

I usually don't bother getting a slice of cheesecake because I don't need the calories but tonight I decided to get a slice of the salted caramel to take home and it was AWFUL! And I mean downright inedible. The ""crust"" was some sort of soggy cookie/brownie thing, I think, but it lacked much any meaningful taste and again, it was soggy. The ""cheesecake"" part of it was apparently supposed to include some nuts but there were barely any and those that were included were chopped so small that I could barely taste or even feel them in my mouth. And it sure as heck wasn't ""cheesecake"". Texture was light and airy, but no recognizable flavor at all. I didn't even taste cream cheese or a dairy flavor. It was weird. The caramel on top was decent, but I ate two bites of it altogether to see if I was wrong when I wanted to spit it out the first time , but I wasn't. I immediately threw the rest out.

Then we could barely hear each other due to the loud music and how busy it was.  Our waiter took our order and we barely saw him again. My husband got coffee and I had to get his attention just to get it refilled and to get bread for my son. I asked about singing for my daughter's bday and got oh yeah ok. When our food came 3 of us got ours and my husband had to wait 3 min to get his. My fries were cold and so were the sautéed mushrooms  on my burger. My husband's $26 rib eye was so salty he had to rub it off with water. Again our waiter wasn't even the one to bring our food so we had to ask the people who did for steak knives and tarter sauce. The tarter sauce was so bad I had to stop eating my meal. My daughter's steak was cold she also had the $26 rib eye. My daughter finally got her bday song as we got our check.

Kaycee G.,"Seattle, WA",5,114,8,2.0,3/16/2015,"Went here today for happy hour with 2 friends. We ordered drinks, several appetizers, entrees, and a slice of cheesecake each. Our food was pretty good but surprisingly the cheesecake wasn't amazing. It was the reeses one.. I think maybe it's too complicated and i should stick to simple, classic cheesecake. The thing that was really off putting was our server. I will remember his name so that I can make sure we don't get him again. We were there for over an hour and he literally never smiled once. Every time we said thank you (which was often), he never once said ""you're welcome"". He seemed annoyed at every turn and when we requested to sit at a booth after just being seated at one of the high bar tables, he looked at me like I had just asked him to fetch me a pot of gold.

Amiram H.,"Redmond, WA",46,26,1,5.0,7/27/2015,"I almost never write a review on chain or franchise restaurants.  Clearly, one branch reflects nothing on the other, and the service level variance can be significant.  Indeed, the same menu is used, but it's quite possible that raw materials come from different places, the chefs have different methods, even the water taste different when you move a few blocks in any direction.  And yet, when something is exceptionally good, chain or not, I felt the urge to share.  The first time I visited Cheesecake Factory was in 1987 in Marina Del Rey.  Apparently it was the second Cheesecake Factory, and the first and only time I couldn't finish a meal...  Yesterday we went with friends to the Cheesecake Factory in Tukwila Washington, and this branch is the subject of my review. The choreography, the furniture, the menus, the uniform, and many other things are most likely the same all over.  Wait time too.  Truthfully, I hate waiting for beepers to go off when I'm hungry.  I hate it even more when I have a hungry child nearby.  But the wait wasn't so bad - not even thirty minutes, and my child was swinging between hungry and nauseous, so we were kind of OK.  The ""server"" (I personally prefer waiter/waitress, and given my Information Technology background, ""server"" is hardware) was particularly courteous.  She quickly brought water and took our orders.  The orders arrived within a reasonable window, and were as ordered, nothing to be taken for granted lately.  Everyone at the table commented on the flavor and presentation of the food.  For me it was the pasta.  The pasta I had yesterday was closest to the pasta my grandmother used to make in her own kitchen from scratch.  I know, sounds incredible, not even possible.  How in the world can a chain restaurant afford to make their own pasta?  I have no idea.  But I can tell the difference between dried overcooked pasta and fresh thick, meaty and flavorful pasta.  I would have expected it at a small mom and pop Italian restaurant, but not at Cheesecake Factory.  I guess positive surprises are still possible. My grandmother passed away almost twenty years ago, and yet I can feel and taste the pasta she used to make in her own kitchen.  Yesterday's pasta at Cheesecake Factory was the closest ever.  Last but not least, our server was really nice and efficient, but I like Penny better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=280

It was a Saturday night, so I called ahead in the morning and they told me wait times would be approximately up to 2 hour to get a table (they didn't do reservations).  I was actually okay with that since there was no alternative and they didn't do reservations on the day of.    However, when I arrived (at 5 pm), they told me it would take 3 hours instead. It wasn't ideal, but I worked with it.  Ultimately, my group didn't get seated until 9:20 pm (which was 4 hrs & 20 minutes of waiting).      Anyways, I went ahead and put my name down since I arrived early and decided to waste the rest of my time at the Mall close by.  When I came back a couple of hours later, we didn't get seated until 9:20 pm (when I was expecting more like 8 pm.   When I asked the hostess about how long, she had a very condescending tone every time I talked with her.  There were other seemingly nice hostess, but the one that I spoke to twice was not very pleasant.  She also told me twice that a table would be ready soon (within 5-10 minutes or so because they were clearing out the table) but she forgot about us twice.  After 20 minutes of waiting, I had to go up and ask another male host if the table was ready.  He was much nicer, but told me that a table wasn't ready yet and the outdoor table was still ordering dessert, which was a much different story than what she told me before.  The hostess said they were clearing out the tables, not that the previous table was just ordering dessert.   When we finally sat down, the other waitress was nice, but I was in a bad mood already and it didn't make up for the experience.  The food was okay, but it wasn't amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=280

Our wait staff took forever to get to our table and it wasn't that busy around us so we had to wonder what was going on. Brought our drinks, then disappeared again as she forgot one. Took our orders and didn't see her again for another 20 min, where we finally got our bread. Had to ask for a refill at this time and again she disappears. Our food came out half hour later, all given to the wrong people but we sorted that out. One salad we never saw till the meal was over and she then asked if he still wanted it. Really? Had to ask for refills again...Everyone seems happy about the meal they received but my favorite was disappointing. Spicy cashew chicken was too sticky sweet, goopy with sauce and the quality of the rice has changed, being the cheap dried out version you get in Chinese restaurants. We asked if we could have a slice of cheesecake as a courtesy to our guest who never got their salad. Yes, no problem but again she disappears, so we paid our bill and had to walk up to the cheesecake counter and ask for it. Horrible, horrible service!

Ahmed K.,"Federal Way, WA",3,26,3,5.0,4/21/2013,"I know what you might be thinking right now: Why do you give a chain restaurant five stars? My answer in this case: Exceptional customer service. While I've never really cared much about customer service when I eat out in general, I was amazed with how good it can get when the restaurant management knows its customer service. This was not my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. In fact, I've been going to the Tukwila and other branches for a while now, but never felt the urge to write a review on it, until today. I went with a friend here for dinner. It was the typical Sunday evening wait time (20 minutes). However, we were seated in about 12 minutes. My friend ordered the salmon with a white butter sauce (they said it wasn't on the menu and it was today's special). I enjoyed the fact that their skinnylicious menu was big enough to have dishes that satisfy practically any taste. I have been dieting and counting calories so I went with the shrimp creole (less than 590 calories, not bad for dinner). Of course, I had to have a couple pieces of their dark honey whole wheat bread, amazingly tasty as usual. My friend and I kept talking and talking for a while only to be interrupted by the manager saying: ""I am really sorry your dinner is taking so long. Your dish looked like someone else's order and was sent to another table. In the mean time can I offer you a complimentary soup or salad?"". I didn't even notice the food was taking so long! Maybe I wasn't so hungry, but still I found it be a great gesture coming from the manager himself and without us even complaining or asking about food. My friend's dish came out 5 minutes after that and mine 5 minutes later, each time with the server apologizing for the delay. I got my dish and it was flavorful, filling and a nice change to the diet food I eat on daily basis. The server checked on us twice, the second time she says: ""I hope you enjoyed your meal and don't worry we'll take care of that for you"". Huh? I thought you already apologized by giving me a complimentary salad. When she brought the bill, they deducted my dish from the total. So basically I got a free salad and entree! The reason I am emphasizing on this is because I wasn't even angry the food took so long, I was enjoying the conversation with my friend. But again that goes to show you that some people take pride in their job and provide excellent customer service. I've been here on many occasions, loving their food from pastas to steaks to cheesecakes.

My wife could not eat it with the brick-for-bread they brought. Server tried to get us some edible bread twice, but finally ended up taking it all away and removing it from our bill.  Manager was understanding at this point.  Wife asked to substitute asparagus for green beans on her order. Platter came out with green beans. Asked the person who brought out the food to get her the asparagus. It came out quickly, but was uncooked, like they just tossed it on a plate and 30 seconds in the microwave. Her mashed potato something was cold and tasteless. Her pork chop was tough and she couldn't eat it.  My Chicken Marsala was at least edible, but I have had better at ""Olive Garden"".

Dustin D.,"Langley, Canada",73,60,11,5.0,8/22/2013,"This is an amazing place to eat as long as you plan ahead for a mild-long wait. It can be anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour depending on the time you go. In my opinion, the wait is well worth it! Our server was Autumn, and she was excellent at helping us choose our foods to eat, knew the menu like the back of her hand (they almost all do), and had a huge smile on and kept us happy for the 45 minutes or so we were seated. Food was excellent (I had the Southwest Chicken Burger, buffalo style) but it always is. Huge portions. But save room for cheesecake afterwards, it's amazing! Key Lime is my fave of the lighter ones but others are amazing too if you want a heavier cheesecake. I might be biased as a Canadian who doesn't get to the Cheesecake Factory too often, but I think it's that wait in between trips to it that makes it so worth-while. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=320

Well unfortunately it was the peak of holiday season and it was packed. The waiter was quick though, and took the drink/food order together to expedite our lunch. The food came shortly after, and we chowed down! I ordered the Ricotta & sausage flatbread pizza, which is a GUILT free lunch choice, and only $6.95! I found it on the ""skinny"" menu, along with a great selection of choices under 550 calories!  If you haven't been to a CF, you usually need a good 10-15 minutes with the menu, as it is HUGE. It is a book. Literally. Choices range from breakfast, to pizza, to burgers, to salads, to comfort foods... endless options! I am also a fan of their breakfast!  Now let's get to the cheesecake! Holy moly, probably 2 pages of cheesecake selections, oh I might need 15 more minutes with the menu for dessert as well!! I've sampled several of them myself, the one that always stands out to me is the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake, and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle.

Ariana D.,"Renton, WA",0,6,,1.0,2/28/2016,"This review is based solely on one experience- but this included an encounter with a manager that supposedly  claimed she had 43yrs of experience in this industry... however being a professional myself she did not exemplify quality customer service in fact the total opposite, until of course I called her back after we left the restaurant to inform her that I had called two Cheesecake Factory locations asking about the happy hour menu and pricing on drinks that were made as skinny drinks not until I told her that then she became very sweet and was trying very hard to apologize however still in the end she did nothing to compensate our bad experience. She did not even offer to pay us back our money for drinks that had been overcharged on her command to her bartenders.  The manager did not know that our bartender knows us as regulars and corrected the bill after Manager left-however the manager left thinking she overcharged us. She apparently did not know that skinny drinks or skinny versions of drinks on the happyhour are still happyhour priced items she kept on telling us that they were not happy hour prices. She repeated over and over on how happy hour drinks were only for the regular versions and she said that they have never offered the skinny drinks there is not even an option to do a skinny drink under the happyhour price so that's why I took things in my own hands and called to other locations asking about that and I was informed that they were the same price. We were very kind when she approached us at the bar and she automatically had this kind of wall defense up we were being super nice and we did not fight with her we simply told her that we are regulars and we have always ordered skinny drinks and they have always been charged as happyhour drinks she was basically telling us that no no that couldn't ever happened. We love the bartenders at Cheesecake Factory! That is why we go to happy hour with them because they are good people and they value our service and they always provide us with quality service! The manager is the one that messed it up for us. This managers name is CYNTHIA & if I knew any better those 43 years of industry work were spent at a Dennys not at a cheescakefactory no way with that customer service quality there is no way that she ever spent 43 years of cheescakefactory no absolute way!

Alternative staff other than your assigned waiter literally ignored any eye contact.  Food was served a bit on the long side,  25+ minutes... But the worst part was they served a wrong dish to our table and also another dish served was WAY undersized.  The skinny turkey burger is smaller than a McD's hamburger and the meat patty was literally smaller than a human tongue.  It was freakishly tiny!   When we addressed the waiter with this bizarre sandwich, he shrugged her shoulders and said ""I can't do anything do you want to talk to a manager?""

Lyna N.,"Lynnwood, WA",299,98,270,3.0,9/20/2013,"I had a very unpleasant experience at this particular Cheesecake Factory today due to our server. His name was Donald H. Since he first came to us (my boyfriend and I), his customer service was horrible and he made it clear that he did not want to be our server for whatever reason. His attitude was bad and chewed gum obnoxiously whenever he talked to us. Our bread he gave us was cold and when I tried to get his attention while he walked past us to get it warmed up, it took me two tries to call him over and he still walked past me but said ""okay."" When we came back to our table to grab the cold bread, he just chews his gum and grabs the bread from the top, touching the entire thing with his palm. That was disgusting. We were very polite to him and always said thank you whenever he gave us something but his attitude was still bad. It's funny that I observed that he was being incredibly nicer to other tables and not ours, perhaps because I am not an older white american like those at the other table? Who knows. I am giving this three stars because the food is great. Our Chicken Bellagio tasted very good, and it is my go-to order at Cheesecake Factory. And our appetizer was also good, which was the guacamole with chips (though we did add lots of pepper and salt to it). It is also a convenient location with lots of food options, and so I find myself coming back here. My favorite cheesecake is the white chocolate raspberry truffle. Anyway, I cannot believe how bad of a server he was. His voice only changed to an enthusiastic tone when he gave us our bill, probably because he wanted tip.

On my recent visit, I realized how dark it is in the restaurant.  My friend and I had our flashlights out so we could read the menu.  We noticed other tables were doing the same thing.  I am beginning to dislike restaurants that are so dark that you need a flashlight to read the menu.  Do they keep it so dark because they don't want diners to see what they are actually eating? Besides being dark, the other thing I don't like about the Cheesecake Factory is how close they have the tables shoved together.  I was in a party of two and we were seated in a section that was nothing but a long line of tables for two that were spaced out a few inches apart.  When the hostess seated us, she seated us right next to an occupied table.  That would have been fine, except the party of two seated at the next table, instead of sitting across the table from each other for some reason had to sit on the same side of the table that is only meant for one person.  Since I was going to be sitting on the side where the two were sitting, I asked the hostess if we could sit at the empty table two down.  At first she said no, then as I was trying to squeeze in past the two dingbats, she came back and told us we could move. I have to wonder about the hostess because if she had any common sense she would have realized the two sitting on the same side of the table would make it difficult for the next table, but no she didn't because after my party and I moved down two tables, she seated another pair at the next table.   It will probably be a long time before I go back to the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=340

I went here yesterday and the wait wasn't too long. We were seating within five minutes.  Our server took our drink orders and we ordered food for the kids so that they don't become anxious. It always work from our experiences! After we got our drinks we ordered our food. A little after we ordered our food we were told that our original server was helping out while our server was on break. They were both really nice.  Our appetizer came out and a little after that our entrees came out. We didn't really have time to finish our appetizer which was fine. We still didn't get the pizza for the kids so we asked our server. She checked into it and was honest. She told us that the ordered wasn't place. She must've told her manager who came by to apologize. He offered a fruit bowl to my daughter while she waits for the pizza.  The pizza came out burnt and the crust was somewhat hard so the kids didn't eat the crust.  We ordered the tater tots which was ok. I wouldn't order it again. It tasted good the first two bites. We also ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta which is absolutely delicious! I love how much pasta they give you. I was able to pack some home for lunch!  Of course we don't leave without ordering dessert. We had to order the red velvet cheesecake to go because we were stuffed. We ate some when we got home. It was amazing!! It was a decent size so we were able to save some for later! I highly recommend the red velvet cheesecake or the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Those two will never fail ur sweet cravings!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=340

Christina G.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,,1.0,2/28/2016,"The wait here is always insane.  The only reason we come here is because my daughter wanted their desert for her birthday.  We were quoted a 55 minute wait. After 50 minutes of waiting and seeing several parties our size that arrived after us get seated,  we struggled through the crowd to the podium to ask about how much longer.  We said  it's been about 50 minutes and wanted know about how much more, to then get the response from the hostess it has only been 47 minutes,  she insisted several times it was only 47 minutes and not 50. She was so rude,  what does about 50 minutes is so drastically different than 47 justified a hostess being so rude?  I found her to be just looking to argue,  I am sure she had a lot of pissy customers due to the ridiculous wait but I don't think how we asked her was in a rude manner or justified how she talked to us.  She then informed us it would  be 20 minutes more.  After waiting 25 more minutes,  I went to inquire to see how many more parties were ahead of us to then watch the hostess arguing with another customer about their wait time,  the customer hardly spoke as the hostess tried to put her in her place over the fact it hadn't been over an hour she had been waiting.  I guess I can take solace in the fact the time reprimand wasn't just for us.  After waiting an hour and 40 minutes we finally got buzzed.  Every one is now hungry and grumpy.  We agreed to be as positive as we could it's my daughters birthday and it's about her.  The food is not awesome especially for the cost or the wait.  My fish and chips order was fried shrimp,  even the food server said fish and chips as she handed me the shrimp. When I did get my fish and chips the tarter sauce was so hot from being under the heat lamp for too long.  Nothing appetizing about hot tartar sauce.   The waitstaff is the one highlight,  they were friendly and as quick as they can be with  the chaos and trying to get through the sea of people and orders.  Never again will I wait to be treated poorly and get sub par food,  I will get my daughter cheesecake to go if she really wants it (even though the takeout is crazy too)  at least it won't be almost 2 hours and a rude as hell hostess for sub par food at a  not worth it price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=340

We went to the mall to kill time and called after an hour instead of going in. Good news, they were preparing the table.

The cheesecake factory has always been known for their extensive menus (20+ pages of food) and also for their large portion sizes. The wait times can be a bit long but they seemed to have gotten better at seating large groups and adding bar space. I went with my girlfriends recently and discovered there is a Happy Hour. It's always nice to be able to get a discount on drinks or apps when you would already be present. I typically get their pasta or at times their breakfast (avail all day). Their portions are large and a little on the medium price range ($20/entree is typical) but you will have a to-go box. I am not a fan of cheesecake but they also have a large range of flavors of cheesecake. I have enjoyed their goblet of strawberries which is shareable and delicious.

Kinda all over the place. We went on a Monday night for a friend's birthday so it wasn't really busy in there. Well the menu was overwhelming. They had too much different meals. I mean, I know they're known for ""cheesecake"" but where does that leave me for my entree? I had no idea what to get. The good thing is they had a choice of ""snacks"" and then ""appetizers"". I started off with my usual wings. They were standard. Nothing too great but not bad either. After sifting through the menu 20 times, I finally just decided to get an Americana cheeseburger. I would have liked to try something different but there was too much stuff to decide. I'm not mad I got my burger though, it was extremely delicious. I even had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Whatever the special sauce is, it's amazing. So why only 3 stars?? The service was terrible. I don't know how it usually is but they took about an hour and a half just to take our order. The lady was nice and I don't know if it was her fault but that was ridiculous. Service has to be bad for me to dock stars because the food is always the most important part for me. No doubt, I will come back here and leave a rereview if the service is better. It could be an unusual instance. No restaurant is perfect.

Rachel F.,"Bremerton, WA",10,16,,1.0,1/23/2012,"If you feel a deep hankering for their cheesecake, do yourself a favor and order it to go. If you are a first timer to a Cheesecake Factory some pointers -Don't go on a weekend night.  They don't take reservations -Expect a large menu (great if you are going out with a ton of different picky eater but always a bad sign in a restaurant since there is no real ""specialty"") -huge portions so skip the apps, or use them as your meal if you are staying for their namesake The Good:  The dessert was wonderful and our substitute waiter was an absolute delight.  We wish we could have given him the tip. The Bad:  The food.  The wait, feeling very rushed (the apps came out mere minutes before after our apps and dinners were grabbed from the kitchen as they came so we all were eating at different times at the same table.  Our waitress.  The Experience.... For the first time we doubled dated with our friends (a married couple with +1 expected) and let the lady with the bump choose our place to eat. After our hours drive and hour wait to get seated we were all pretty ready to eat. Our server was pleasant enough and took our order, brought us our bread and drinks.....and then went on break. Our apps came out a half hour after seating along with the pre-dinner salads.  Not normal but we didn't complain since we finally had food on the table.  As most people are, when I'm hungry my standards slip dramatically, and I was ready for anything.  Anything except what I got.  I ordered the crab and artichoke dip for an app....it tasted of warm mayonnaise some artichoke and the crab was probably juice since it tasted awful.  I took a few bites and had to waive the flag.  I chowed down on my partners potstickers (pretty good!) We hadn't even finished our apps when 1/2 of the dinners arrived.  There was no sense of timing with the waitstaff and the kitchen.  We did not hold up our pregnant friend from eating and had the rest of the apps boxed up.  This was really upsetting since one of the apps was just guac and chips. Boxing that up felt insulting. The dinner.  After the disappointing apps I was ready for dinner, and with lower expectations.  It still didn't soften the blow.   I ordered Wasabi encrusted Ahi tuna with veggies instead of rice.  The wasabi encrusted Ahi was bland.  Hats off to the chef for making that combo bland.  Ahi is so flavorful unless its of poor quality or storage.  You dont even cook it....I mean scewing Ahi up is just sad and points to a rather obvious problem at this place....no quality control whatsoever.  Bland wasabi?  Are you kidding me?  I had my friends husband try it and he agreed.  I was left with shredded buttered veggies. At this point its been 3 hours....I've barely eaten and the money invested in this meal would have gotten me a pair of designer jeans.   I didn't waive my flag just yet.  I had to order cheesecake....I was hungry and well....hungry. Hooray!  They didn't screw up the cheesecake!  I ordered the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and it was blissful.  The coffee was awful but was turned around with sugar and cream (as Tom described it: it tasted like the industrial sh** coffee we have on the submarine).  Our actual server was so useless for the first time in my life I tipped pre-tax and rounded down. Save yourself the trip, even if you want to impress a girl, take her out to some fancy expensive LOCAL place....the bill goes up way to fast here (no alcohol was ordered either), not to mention the wait or the waitstaff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=380
Ray C.,"Seattle, WA",0,78,,2.0,10/26/2015,"I really don't know what to think...so I am going to say that we went on a off afternoon. Let me start by saying that I have been a fan since the 90's in Marina del Rey and Beverly Hills, California locations. Never had a BAD meal. My friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich (which looked as though they took a teaspoon of salad and spread it ultra thin on the bread, hoping that the person eating it wouldn't notice on how skimpy the cook was.  Then he had the chicken tortilla soup which wasn't any way close to the tortilla soup we have ever had in California....this was a very thick tomato based soup that was pure yuk ! I ordered an omlet that was so so....it could have been better but I ate most of it, and thought to MYSELF I will never order one again here.  My friend told the waitress what he thought of it and she DID mention it to the Manager....and I have to say kudos to him, he deleted the soup and sandwich from the bill, which I thought was nice & only fair . Since Marc really didn't eat much of it.  Service is ALWAYS good as is the food....so am not going to say that I will never return, cause I will. They are known for their cheesecake, and I don't eat cheesecake so if you do then this would be the place for you to indulge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=380
Dalin C.,"Kent, WA",134,51,11,3.0,12/13/2013,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory when it was my idea one time. Every other time, I tagged along. The Cheesecake Factory is a mainstream restaurant. A very mainstream restaurant. So what you will find there is a large establishment with bells, whistles, and money left over for more bells and whistles. The decor is very colorful and from what I understand they're all designed in-house. It's almost like walking into the Island of Misfit Decorations, but the odd shapes, hand-blown glass lighting, and cherry wood accent section.  I am convinced that the Cheesecake Factory believes that more is more. More cheesecake. More art to look at. More pages to turn in our menu. If you go to the Cheesecake Factory, be prepared for an experience that can put your eyes on overload.       My service came with a smile. Sometimes that's all you need. Sometimes it can come off feeling like the most generic action a waiter musters up. Unfortunately, I felt like I got the latter off of this visit. It was a Thursday evening and just as busy as a Friday. Did you know people eat everyday? Anyway, back to the service. It was quick. It was painless. For a restaurant that big and one that caters to so many different appetites, I'm not expecting to fall in love. He checked on us often and save one time, I never felt neglected.      The food portions are where this place genuinely shines. Be hungry. Otherwise, your right or left hand will be carrying something extra when you leave. Every time. From pasta to sandwiches to steak to seafood to pasta again, there are over 200 menu choices to make your waiter come back at least 4 times before you decide. Tonight, I had the Tex-Mex Egg rolls, Chicken Bellagio, and a Mai Tai. My table was all around the world and back. The egg rolls were good. Quite good, in fact, and were accompanied by a small bowl of pico de gallo and avocado cream. However, the egg rolls tasted and looked like something I could have popped in the microwave for three minutes. Presentation didn't scream gourmet to me. Now typically where The CF succeeds in spades is in the presentation of their entrees. The Chicken Bellagio did not disappoint. Lightly breaded chicken over basil pasta and topped with Parmesan cream sauce, prosciutto, and arugula salad. It looked delicious. It looked ready for me to show the efforts of all my knife and fork combination training. It looked ready.  It was ok.       The chicken, while wonderfully breaded, wasn't the most flavorful and the cream sauce was not as plentiful as it probably should have been. It was more of a hint of sauce than it was a layer over the pasta. That could have been the intention all along, I'm not sure. The arugula salad didn't do much to compliment the overall taste of the dish. I've heard great reviews on this meal, so I was a little surprised to come across this. Didn't end up being bad. It was just a little basic. The mai tai, even after stirring a little, didn't blend very well. The sweetness stayed at the top and the rum hung out with the ice when I got to the bottom. I may have needed to stir mor, but every good mai tai I have had, had that nice sweet and sour blend top to bottom.      A couple things I want to note: I wish that there was some manner or method to the madness to being able to control the herds that are waiting for a table. It clogs up the hostess area, the entryways to the tables, and the place where you can make purchases. I understand there's basically just standing room with a couple of benches, but when you have kids and the elderly coming through, not everyone is paying attention. Fact is, most folks think it's absolutely fine not getting out of the way. That's not Cheesecake Factory's fault. However, what is, is their lack of crowd control. Another thing, I really...really wish they would put the silverware on the napkin. Or something. I understand that the tables get cleaned and wiped down before they're put there, but that rag used... unless it's within their guidelines to use a fresh rag each and every time, then I'm going to need better.      Overall, for the pricing, there are better options. For taste, there are better options. They're not quite the fresh ingredient-using, gourmet restaurant that all advertisement claims to be. However, your appetite and eyes will be full by the time you leave. If you go, enjoy it. Part of any restaurant experience is also what you make of it. And I wish you well on your parking journey. I don't know if I have yet to be at a TCF that did not have a ""parking lot situation"" at almost any time of the day. I'll go back. But it won't ever be my idea to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=380

You gave us some free appetizers, though, so we forgave you.  Then, you swapped two entrees at the table: fish tacos to the chicken tacos lady, and vice versa. They sat at different ends of the table so they each sent them back without knowing. Well, fish taco recipient had taken a bite and had the flu. When the correct order arrived, new fish taco recipient saw a big old bite in her taco. Why?? Because the waiter didn't throw the entrees away when they got sent back. They just swapped them and brought it right back out. ISN'T THAT AGAINST SOME FDA FOOD SAFETY REGULATION?!?! I feel like somebody's food handler permit should be revoked for this.

We placed our drink and food orders promptly and our food arrived in perfect timing. Our drinks were refilled constantly and we never felt like we had to wait to get something. Compared to many Cheesecakes in the past, this one surpassed them all in terms of service. Bravo Tukwila! (I still don't know how to pronounce that!) The food was also good-It didn't taste like it had been sitting under a heat lamp or anything. My husband and I split the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was delicious! A first for both of us and we will for sure order it again. We split it so that we could get our own desserts and not spend a crapload. I got the Godiva cheesecake, my husband got the tiramisu.

Tarah M.,"Seattle, WA",62,201,19,3.0,4/17/2011,"I'm not gonna lie: I really wanted to give this place 2 stars.  When I was invited to dinner, I thought to myself, ""You're going to despise this place because their food is frozen, it's not a local establishment, and their processed dishes will just make you blow up like the Michelin (wo)man with all that sodium and preservatives.""  But, as I arrived predetermined to write a scathing review of this place, I surprised myself as the night progressed at how decent this place is.  Let me explain with first the bad and end with the good. BAD: This place is a zoo!!  A Friday evening with 4 starving people (myself included) started with a bubbly teenage host telling me it was about a 45 min wait.  As she handed us the buzzer, I thought that surely we could find another place to go.  But, we waited and watched as more people stuffed themselves in the lobby waiting with the same pained looks on their faces as we did.  However, we lucked out after 10 minutes at scoping out a cocktail table in the bar that we attacked like vultures when a couple left..others weren't so lucky.  ALSO BAD: Their food choices are plenty and fill about 10 pages of menu...but be wary if you don't eat meat, as there are very few vegetarian meals offered. I also noticed that their dishes aren't very healthful, and the abundant portions they provide just whisper calorie overload. Sometimes, I do think that less is more with high quality in ingredients.  I just think the focus here is more on quantity, which I don't really prefer when evaluating the 2 ""Qs."" With that said, how could there be anything good at this place? Here's how: GOOD: Considering the limited choices and heavy meal choices, I was able to select a delectable salad with substitutions, and the waitress accommodated my request with no problem.  I was also able to save half of my salad as leftovers because my dressing was served on the side and I enjoyed it the very next day.  Also, the chopped vegetable salad I had was fresh, perfectly made, and very good!  We did splurge on the cheesecake, which we had the mango key lime as well as the red velvet, and it was well worth the splurge! They obviously know how to make their cheesecakes. REALLY GOOD: The service was wonderful!  Considering this place was a zoo, and there were plenty of diners as well as staff, this place was efficiently run and all the staff appeared to be patient, friendly, and helpful!  Our waitress was really nice and attentive, and I didn't expect this at this type of restaurant. I normally wouldn't eat here, but I certainly had a great experience.  A-OK to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=420

Zulkiffly S.,"Seattle, WA",102,96,2,3.0,2/2/2011,"This place really disappoints me. Let me explain. I really love their Hot-wings. The sauce is so good. But. . . They never cook the chicken all the way through. The first time I ordered it, it was perfect. The chicken was cook just right. But the next time I went it was red inside. It took a bite of the first one and it was bloody. I thought to myself that maybe it was just that one piece. I tried not to let it bother me and went for another piece. Once again it was red. Now I'm irritated. 2 out of 8 piece are bloody so far. Went for a third one. And, you guessed it, bloody. I told the waiter, he took it back and said sorry. He asked if I wanted a new batch. I said no. I still had the taste of chicken blood in my mouth. I didn't want to get any chicken at the time.  That was the first time. . .  I went back again about a month later. Ordered the Hot-wings again. Came out half cooked. I told the waitress, she said sorry and didn't take it back. The supervisor came over and told us that the chicken is cooked fresh so it's hard to cook it all the way through, so bloody is ok. (made no sense to me.) Now I'm upset. He made an excuse for his chefs bad work. I couldn't understand how you could serve half cooked food to your customers. They never took the Hot-wings back and even charged us for it. What a donkey's hole.  Overall this happened 4 times. Every time I ordered it I was hoping that this was the time they would cook it right, like they did the first time. But nope.  Enough of that.  Overall though, the place is a good place to take a girlfriend. The food is decent, just don't order the wings. ( unless you're a vampire ) The atmosphere is romantic. Dark with dim lights. The tables are big, so you don't feel like you have to keep you elbows in. The drinks are decent. Everything is decent. . .

Ordered my standard drink, the Rasberry Lemonade, and ordered appetizers - Avocado egg rolls and fried Mac and Cheese. The boyfriend ordered the Strawberry Lemonade, and we split the appetizers, which are ALWAYS GOOD. When the waitress came to ask if we were going to order entrees, even though i had told her before hand that we would only have appetizers, I found it a bit pushy, especially in the way she did it. I mean, if im hungry, ill order more right? But im good right now, thank you....and yes, im STILL good after you come and ask me the same thing for the third time.

The Tweens had pizza and cheese macaroni burger which they loved and sister in law had the lettuce tacos (can't remember what it was called) but she absolutely loved it. Finally brother in law had the all American burger and loved it as well. The portions were generous and food was brought out hot. The cheesecake was the best ever!

This visit happened to be for my niece's 12th birthday, which happened to land on a Friday.  Yes, of all nights... we went to Cheesecake Factory on a Friday evening AFTER 5 with a party of over 30 guests!  We waited nearly an hour for our table, which surprisingly wasn't bad at all.  We had 2 waiters for both ends of our long table.  They were even nice enough to add an extra table of 4 on as we had more guest arriving. I been very fond of the flavored Mojitos lately and I gave the Pomegranate Mojito a try.  Still on the minty side, so I highly doubt I'll be having that again... and totally not worth $9! As for entrees, nothing sounded too appealing to me, so I went back to the old Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken.  But I did ask for half spinach fettuccine.  When I got my entree, it was weird to see full sized fettuccine as well as linguini noodles (which happened to be the regular and spinach).  Overall, it was still good and I was happy that they were able to accommodate to my request as they haven't been able to do it all other visits. When it came time to bring out my niece's birthday cake, they made a huge scene singing aloud.  And since it was a small 8"" round cake that needed to be cut in certain sizes just to have enough to go around for our group, I was able to cut the cake and the waiters passed out the slices to the rest of the guests. Overall, I think they did a great job accommodating to our huge party.  Although, I wouldn't recommend doing that large of a group on a Friday evening again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=420

Rod P.,"Renton, WA",0,6,,1.0,4/16/2013,"On Sunday, April 14th, we were invited to attend a friends birthday celebration at the Cheesecake Factory in Tukwila, Wa. My friend had called ahead to inquire about getting reservations as we had a party consisting of nine people. She was told ""The Cheesecake factory does not accept reservations. Just show up and place your name on the wait list."" OK, no problem. We all arrived at about 4:30 and proceeded to place our name on the wait list at which time we were told by hostess that because we had such a large party that she would have to check with the manager first. Uh...weren't we told to just show up and place our name on the list? After standing around for 15 minutes wondering if we had been forgotten, the hostess returns and tells us that they would be able to accommodate our party, but that, ""it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait."" If you check on their website it states, ""We are able to easily accommodate large parties"" Really!? Exactly how was our experience accommodating?  Now mind you that it was Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was exceptionally slow that day. Yes, there were people milling about waiting for a table, but not the normal, people-stepping-on your-toes-line-outside-the-door type of busy. The decision was made to go elsewhere rather than wait for more than an hour just to be seated. The funny thing was that when my friend posted her displeasure on The Cheesecake Factory, they immediately took down her comments. I guess they don't want anyone to critique their restaurant. You would think that they would welcome feedback in order to help improve their customer relations. We will never go back to the Cheesecake Factory again as a result of this horrible experience.

So find your local Cheesecake factory and check it out. .. And may I recommend the pineapple upside-down cheesecake? It is sooo very yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=460
Jolene D.,"Houston, TX",259,163,172,4.0,3/18/2012,"Ordered a pizza here. Of course their cheesecake is delicious! When I went to the one in Seattle I ordered a veggie burger and the peppermint bark cheesecake. At least that's what I think the cheesecake is called. If you like mint and chocolate together I suggest you gotta try it.  Their fried foods are not very greasy and dripping in oil like most places. The spring rolls are average, I don't think you should order Asian food from a place like the Cheesecake Factory though. You should stick to an authentic Asian restaurant. So come to Cheesecake Factory if you don't mind spending a little extra money. It's worth it, I think.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=460
Phil S.,"Auburn, WA",12,154,8,3.0,6/4/2009,"We have a ton of family in town this weekend and we chose to eat at a place that was near where everyone was staying, so we chose the cheesecake factory. This place is good, not amazing.  The pros are that there is an enormous menu, which I guess you could also view as a con. They don't really specialize in anything (aside from cheesecake).. you can get Mexican, Italian, Salads, whatever your heart can dream up they probably have it on their menu. It took our big group forever to make a decision on what to eat. One other good thing is that we didn't have reservation and getting a party of greater than 10 in there was no big deal (On a Wednesday evening granted).  The food was pretty good. I has spicy cashew chicken, which tasted pretty good, though I have certainly had better Asian dishes like that.  In the end we all shared a couple of pieces of various cheesecakes which were very very good. My favorite is their white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. Highly recommended.  All in all, if you are near southcenter mall this place is as good as any, maybe a cut above. Recommended for large groups with varying tastes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=460
Scot K.,"Bellevue, WA",10,262,,2.0,4/5/2010,"Health Department Alert!!! Here's where you need to be warned.  We were waiting by the counter for the deserts.  There was a middle aged woman behind the counter preparing the various cakes and pies for the wait staff to serve.  She wasn't wearing gloves like the rest of the prep staff and she had a blue cover over one of her fingers, which I assume was bandaged.  She would touch the tops of the plates and use her bare finger to spruce up the whipped cream.   That's not the worst part.  She then grabbed a broom and began sweeping the floor.  She finished that, then without washing her hands or putting on gloves started preparing more deserts touching the plates and the various pies, cheesecakes and whipped cream for service to the diners.  Yuck!  Needless to say, no one in our group ordered any deserts.  She noticed that we had been watching her, so without washing her hands, she put on some gloves. The place was really busy for a Saturday at 5:30.  It must have been all the mall shoppers or maybe early Easter revelers.  We had to wait about 30 minutes to get a seat. As far as the food goes, its a chain restaurant and it was decent.  We went to have a decent meal and a variety of deserts.  But we really lost our desire to have any after watching the preparation. With all of the heightened awareness of hepatitis, E Coli, salmonella and a plethora of food borne illnesses, you would think management would vigrously train the staff to maintain high sanitary standards.

The food is consistent and decent. It doesn't ""wow"" me but it isn't bad either. It is fairly expensive, though. I believe burger/fries is $10, Pasta is $12-15.  Cheesecake is around $7 per slice - depending on what you choose. The servers/waiters are usually friendly and attentive to their customers. The only thing I truly dislike about this restaurant is the noise level (they can't help it if there are screaming babies surrounding the restaurant) and dimmed lights. It's super dark in the restaurant and I guess it is one of their tactics (you can't see how much you're eating?) But honestly. Awkward if you're eating dinner with a guy/girl friend and all the sudden the lights start to dim around 7 or 8pm.

Janice Marie B.,"Waipahu, HI",555,15,153,4.0,6/16/2012,"Visited on Monday, June 11th.  I went with my cousin, niece and nephew.  We chose Cheesecake Factory Southcenter Mall because we went shopping at South Center Mall or else we usually go to Bellevue. We walked in at noon and was seated right away without having to wait - Thats the best thing considering there is a waiting list by the hours at Waikiki Hawaii's location. The service was exceptional as always but it took the 2nd round for the server to get us the warm bread basket. I ordered the Lunch Portion Chicken Picatta and it was a fresher & better butter lemon capers sauce than my fave place Paesano's.  My niece had her usual Lunch Portion Chicken Fettucini which is always a winner.  My cousin had the Lunch Portion meatloaf and she thought it was so - so, nothing spectacular about it.  My nephew had the regular shrimp platter and that too was just alright. Half way through lunch you get full because of two rounds of the wheat bread basket that you have to take home the leftovers.  We also did take out on the Red Velvet Cheesecake which was worth the drive down to South Center Mall from Lynnwood & Mulkilteo.  Although we were all too full to have a bite of the cheesecake, I'm pretty sure it was as awesome as if you tasted it before.

Sherry S.,"Seattle, WA",13,82,528,4.0,8/9/2010,"This is usually my go-to place when I want something American-ish but aren't sure what exactly. The fact that they have such a HUGE selection is awesome. Sometimes the wait is super long but if you're not THAT hungry and have friends to pass time with then it's not so bad.  I've had a range of service here from horrible to excellent. I guess it really just depends on the day and who you get.  I'm usually happy with the food I get at TCF... USUALLY.  List of things I've had here:  *Buffalo Blasts: Loove the crispiness of the wrapper. Can get a bit greasy sometimes but I personally love this. Tasty! Love the kick of this. *Crispy Crab Wontons: Not bad... I would get it again. I love almost anything with cream cheese but it can get nauseating. *Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-dried tomatoes: This was probably the first dish I had at TCF. Used to be my favorite... now it's so-so. Love the creaminess of it though so if you're craving alfredo-type-like pasta this isn't a bad choice. The sun-dried tomatoes add a good tang to it.  *Louisiana Chicken Pasta: The name speaks for itself. I do feel like I'm in New Orleans when I'm eating this dish. I actually like the parmesan crusted chicken in this even though it's greasier. hehehe oops *Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: Eh... Don't recommend it unless you like dry pasta... at least when I had it, it was pretty dry... However, I guess it is pretty for the eyes :) *Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic: MMM Used to be one of my favorites but the past few times I've had it, it's been just alright. Good if you're craving a garlic-parmesan type of pasta. *Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: YUCK. No Thanks!  *Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: eh... a lot of people seem to like this dish but I just happen to NOT be a fan of it.. it's alright... but I wouldn't get it again. It does taste very cajun though. *Pasta Bellagio: This was okay to me... not bad... not great but good. I found it to be a bit salty though but maybe that was 'cause of the prosciutto  *Salisbury Steak: YUCK! No flavor - a waste of effort to eat. lol *White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake: Mmmm this is BOMB in your mouth ... delicious and creamy. I love it *Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake: Delicious! SUPER RICH and Chocolatey - Must be a chocolate lover to like! Overall- Not a bad place to go for lunch or dinner (haven't tried breakfast), also great for birthday dinners and celebrations __________ UPDATED 6/2/2017 Moving up to 4 stars from my last review years ago.  After eating at TCF for years, I could probably conclude that this is my favorite chain restaurant for many reasons. Their menu is huge so options are endless and there is something for everyone. Every time I eat at TCF, I tell myself that I'll try something new but always end up sticking with my usual: Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic (Sub farfalle w/ linguine)  Creamy Garlicky Goodness!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=440

Shelby W.,"Renton, WA",796,109,53,3.0,1/2/2013,"Every time I come here all I can think is how much money they're making. 90% of the time you have to wait before being seated. I remember leaving once and seeing over 50 people waiting to be seated. They must be doing something right here. Surprisingly we were able to be seated right away. I ended up getting the macaroni and cheese burger. As far as burgers go I think it's the best they have.It's a regular burger with a fried macaroni and cheese patty put in the burger. When you bite into it and taste that nice gooey mac and cheese mixed with the patty there's just nothing like it. I would've given this visit a 4 but our waiter by the name of Colin decided it was ok to try and rush us out because he said he had paperwork to do. We were more than obliged to leave since it was Christmas Eve and getting late. But then when he brought back the bill he just had to say it again and then he said ""if you could just sign that really quick so I could get to my paperwork"". We were like ok dude we get the point you have paperwork to do. Then when he comes back for the signed receipts he says and I quote ""yeah I just really need to get to this paperwork guys thanks"". It was just overkill and my friend was like dude I get it you have paperwork you didn't need to say it again. Aside from the whole paperwork incident everything was fine.

WTH? I'm a pretty indecisive person and if you give me too many options, I'd rather not choose at all. Since I heard how people love this place, I figured I'd try something. So, what do I do? I opt to choose from the ""small plate"" page and selected 2 dishes. It was the only thing I could do. I felt way too overwhelmed and with that many dishes offered, is everything really fresh?

Tori J.,"Seattle, WA",14,252,,3.0,5/3/2010,"Yeah so, they forgot one order.  Four people ordered and three plates came up. I could tell they forgot because the waitress panicked when she realized we were waiting for plate numero qautro.  qautra? It was my dad's but I'm a female speaking. Whatever -those romantic languages are kind of weird with their genders for everything.  Anyhow. I shared my delicious Kobe Burger, my sister shared hers, and my other sister shared her orange chicken. Dad was not starving. It was all good.  Even if that was an obnoxious mistake.  I love this place and so do my sisters.  Dessert arrives for birthday girl, I go and order a cheesecake to go , to save time. Cue sarcastic laughter.  I pay. I wait ten minutes. I track down the person and ask how long it usually takes because I'd never bought one before. Some guy piped up he ordered on the phone and they said it would be ready half an hour ago. Yikes. They took care of him and I tried to get another person's attention. Apparently they just have to get it out of the freezer. The second person I tracked down conveyed a message in the third person...while the woman I placed the order with was within two feet. Aw, they were like a really dsyfunctional family. Adapting to work around the bad habits and non participation of other employees. It was really sweet, in an annoying and unhelpful way.    Finally got the message what I paid for was out of stock. Whatever, it's okay. Nobody wanted to pay twenty something bucks for an oreo cheesecake anyway - even if it was birthday girl's favorite. We pick another and  person two blanches at my receipt. She charged me for a bigger cheesecake(I checked the posted prices), but the guy behind the counter didn't want to admit it so we just got ours quicker.  And I- having spent over half an hour trying to buy something they could reach into a freezer and grab ( In theory. If that cheesecake existed - this story is starting to get metaphysical. You know they're incompetent if you start doubting what you know about reality) was on a schedule so I ate the extra cost and left. In retrospect, every time I've ordered a cheese cake ( last times it was slices) they have been out. Then I ordered something else, but they aren't keeping track of their cheesecake...at the cheesecake factory. It makes you want to hold your head in both hands and sigh. The cheesecake itself can make you forget all the mess ups.   The menu is like a teen magazine and a little ridiculous to most adults.  But the food and the decor is great.

The service:  Actually really good.  The service was seamless and even though our current server went off shift there was a good change over and the new server never missed a beat.  The food came out on time, well plated (for a factory) and it tasted good! I had the Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp.  It had a decent flavor but I longed for a bit more of a hit of curry as the dish promised.  But other than that no complaints.  The wife and son had a B.L.T. Salad and a Pulled B.B.Q Pork Sandwich, respectively.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal just fine but none of us were able to finish.  What we noticed was the portions were extremely generous and to finish would seem a gluttonous affair. Doggie bags all around the bill came with some damage but not anything out of the ordinary.  I did tip well and genuinely thanked our server.  He did an outstanding job for the venue.  If you're looking to have food served up foundry style, let the Cheesecake Factory pour the industrial portions like a cement truck pouring a foundation.  Plus you'll have tomorrows lunch ready to go in a cute little bag!  Woof!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=500

We had a lot of fun reading the calorie counter menu and making jokes about heart attacks, and then we went and ordered this rich, heavy food and chowed down on it and enjoyed every bite. This is a good place to stop in and have a nice relaxing dinner.

Since my father has never eaten at the Cheesecake before we thought it would be a cool experience for him. First of all I was a little wary because naturally there was a huge Line since it was a Saturday. But we asked for the first available table and were sat outside which was great since it had been a sunny day, and we only waited 15 minutes. On to the food. The menu is crazy huge! Almost three pages dedicated just to appetizers and salads! My brother and I ordered the crab won ton appetizer, Ahh-mazing! For the main course I ordered the chipotle pasta which is also really good and something worthy of getting the recipe down and making at home. My father surprisingly ordered some breakfast platter which looked pretty hearty and healthy. There was some minor hiccups in service though. First was when everybody ordered their drinks. My step mom and brother both ordered their cocktails first and received them pretty quick. But when I finally ordered my long island I waited like 25 min. only waiting for the waitress to tell me that some how my drink got lost or pick upped by someone for another table. Second, we ordered our appetizers and received our main course's like no more than ten minutes later, so we had like a million plates on the table to navigate. Lastly when my Dad checked the bill and they charged us for the first Long Island I never received. Overall, good experience despite the minor hiccups which I just attribute to an off day. Great service, even better cheesecake(best I've ever had) .Cool environment and nice place to take the family every once in awhile.

Only downside was that I ordered the seasonal cheesecake which is a mango, key lime cheesecake,( I asked the server what it all entailed and he said it was just like the key lime but with a layer of mango)   and I normally order the key lime and I LOVE mango, so I figured it was a MATCH:( WRONG.... I ordered it togo and once we got home and I took the 1st biteI realized the bottom crust has a layer of shredded coconut!!! I am allergic to coconut:( booooooo........

A conversation with person at your own table was difficult to say the least. I ordered the Hibachi steak for $19.95, Rare to Medium Rare. It arrived Medium-Well and DRY. We started noticing a trend. The person who seated us and took our drink order was different then the person who brought them. And this trend continued as it appeared to be with a different person each time. So requesting anything seemed to initiate the hour glass being turned freshly over each time. Upon dessert time we asked how large the slices of cheese cake were. We were advised, ""Oh they're big. One slice is large enough to easily feed two people."" So much time had elapsed we decided to take the cheesecake to go. Upon arriving home and looking forward to our desserts we were amazed to find our waitress's idea of 'big' is not what the rest of the common world would think of it as. The slices were of average size. About the same size, if not a slight bit smaller, then the slices in the precut frozen cheesecakes at costco.

We decided to take our family of 7 to this place for dinner. The place was busy and we waited for about 15 minutes. We were seated and our waiter, David, presented himself to announce the specials for the day. There could have been a teleprompter that he was reading from, for all of the lack of warmth and personality that he didn't have. Dude are you working for tips or what? Ok, so 10 minutes go by and he comes back. We order, he says would you like some bread to begin with, we say sure. Ok another 15 minutes and where is the bread? Hmmm....we're really hungry at this point. Here comes the bread, fast forward another 20 minutes and here come our meals. Well all of our meals minus one. My daughter doesn't get her meal and we say to David, who btw, does not serve but others do, we're missing a meal.He says I know it's coming. Well thanks buddy, we're feeling the warmth for sure. Another 15 minutes and finally here is her meal. 3 of our party ordered pasta, all 3 of these were so incredibly salty that they were uneatable. I order the bacon and shrimp sandwich with fries which was ok but the fries were heavily salted, nope can't eat them. My grandson had a kids pizza, wasn't regular mozzarella but a combination of something, which he didn't care for. My son had a burger which oddly enough wasn't salted enough. One of our party had the salmon with mashed potatoes which he said was great. We don't see David for awhile, he comes back to clear dishes. He sees that the dishes are hardly eaten but he neither offers nor comments on this. Our only saving grace for this meal was the cheesecake for dessert. Any hey people, please look at your receipts, an 18% gratuity is added on but your server will not tell you this. If you don't read this, you will probably add another tip on top of what they are already making. So again, if you want some really great cheesecake, have at it and come to this place. If I'm going to take my family of 7 somewhere, it won't be to this place again. For paying almost $200.00 for this meal, nope my expectations are a bit higher.

We went to the Cheesecake Factory at Southcenter (Westfield Shoppingtown at Southcenter) in Tukwila today, but only for dessert and coffee drinks. Quoted a 25 minute wait for a table, we almost turned-tail and left for a Starbucks.  The 25 minute wait ended up being only 10-15 minutes.   The place was noisy and busy (but not as busy as I'd seen at DT Seattle and in Bellevue) but not loud enough to prevent from engaging in table conversation.  Service was also just right. The desserts, a collection of slices of cheesecake, fresh strawberries, and a mud pie cake, were all great and almost too large a serving to be enjoyable (the food has large servings too if I recall correctly)... but of course, it comes at a cost.  For four adults, and two kids, I believe the bill was close to $60+ dollars.  That's an expensive coffee date in my book.  And as I mentioned earlier, the drip coffee was $3! This was a special day, as we'd been spending time with relatives in-town for the holidays, but normally we wouldn't have done this.  If the mall still had a Farrell's ice cream (gone since the 1980s), that'd be the place we likely would have gone to if it still existed. Parking is free and generally plentiful -- there's a new garage built right next to the CF.  Transit riders are generally marginalized around the Southcenter Mall as the stops are pretty far away to the east and there's a long walk to get to CF from there.   Bottom line: I'll probably come here again, but keep it for special occasions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=520

Gene B.,"Seattle, WA",86,281,117,2.0,8/30/2009,"There is something decidedly off about the South Center location. The layout is awkward and counter-intuitive, the service is very plodding, not very skilled and the food is substandard. The first time that I ever went to The Cheesecake Factory it was at the downtown location shortly after it opened and I was prepared to hate it, but it wasn't so bad. I've been there a couple of times since and it's been about the same. Why the South Center location is so different is a mystery to me. You'd think that with a chain establishment there'd be more consistency, but apparently not. No great loss, there's just too many options out there to get bogged down in this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=520
Elizabeth S.,"Peoria, AZ",33,15,5,1.0,5/10/2009,"I'm brown, I get down and I can lean with best of cholos... Now with this being said it makes me wonder why ANYONE, let alone the woman serving me and my black friend who find it appropriate to make a racial slur.  It all started one glorious day at the establishment I refer to as The Factory. Normally, this is a three star establishment. The menu is about as thick as a deck of playing cards, the food is a bit better than Applebees but they have the best ranch and iced tea around. And yes, I am the kinda girl who orders a side of ranch for whatever I'm eating.  Anyways, we order our drinks: an iced tea for me (passion flavored of course) and a lemonade for my besty and in about ten minutes they show up at our table. Then we wait on our complimentary bread which shows up in another 15 minutes or so. At this point we are BOTH out of drinks and our order still has NOT been taken. A few more minutes go by and our order has been taken--- 2 sandwiches neither of which were fancy unless you consider the pickles I ask to be put in my grilled cheese. Yes, I was pregnant at the time. And yes, our drinks still had not be refilled. 15 minutes or so later our food comes out sans the ranch dressing. I, of course, ask for ranch again and point out our drinks need to be topped off. Our server leaves for the ranch and the drinks and then then it hits us--- the smell of nail polish remover.... The smell is unmistakable, heavy and is wofting at our table. When the server gets back with our drinks and ranch I have to ask her what this smell is. I assumed someone was doing their nails in the kitchen since we were sitting along the kitchen wall... The server responds with, ""THERE IS A MEXICAN FIXING THE DOOR.""  I was shocked. Floored one might say. Flabbergasted even. It took me a minute to pick my jaw up off the table. What the hell does a ""Mexican"" fixing the door have to do with the smell. And do I care if said person fixing the door is in fact Mexican? And we are clearly a table of questionable whiteness.... Had the person fixing the door been white would we have heard that some white guy was doing the job. I am going to assume that the Mexican fixing the door was the cause of the acetone smell but that was never explicitly told to me.  My advice to anyone, anywhere is to know your audience. If the people in front of you are not your nationality please do not play a race card. Whether you realize it or not it is horrifying to the people in front of you and it will make for a story that will be told for months to come.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=520

If it wasn't for my husband who likes the place mainly for nostalgic memories... I'd avoid it all together. Our waitress was a complete airhead last time and kept making us repeat ourselves. Every drink, appetizer and meal was brought out by a different person. Someone attempted to give our appetizer to the neighboring table and another server gave our drinks to a different neighboring table! Really? The salads are huge but they don't have a good flavor. Mine had cold flavorless chicken on it last time and plastic tasting tortilla strips. The hot wings aren't good either, but you can buy a few live chickens for your yard for the same price as they charge for them. It's just so expensive for the quality..I don't get the hype. Although they do have yummy cheesecake, I can't stand paying 8 bucks for a slice of something I can make a whole one of for less. They should stop selling food and just be a cheesecake place.

Kathryn M.,"Port Angeles, WA",66,18,1,1.0,3/10/2013,"We had a very disappointing experience.  First, we were told the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour, Every time we checked in, they told us it would only be 5 more minutes.  An hour and a half later we were finally seated.  It took us about 20 more minutes just to get our drinks.  Then we ordered an appetizer, and it came our with our food.  We ordered the Ahi Tartare, and it came out with 1/4 Ahi, 3/4 avocado.  It was very disappointing; however, it set the tone for the evening.  My granddaughter ordered the Wasabi Crusted Ahi, and I ordered the fish and chips.  My daughter ordered the garlic pasta, and my other granddaughter ordered shrimp scampi.  The first two dishes came out with the appetizer.  The fish and chips were good, but the crusted Ahi was actually soggy.  It was not a crust at all.  It was a soggy breadcrumb coating.  And the bed of rice that was under it tasted like instant rice.  5 minutes later, the other two dishes came out.  The scampi was actually deep fried and was still raw in the center, and the garlic pasta had about 4 shrimps and maybe 5 veggies.  It was a lot of pasta with hardly any sauce, but it did have more than enough salt.  We did send the scampi back, and she ordered fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp.  The fettuccine came out and was so salty that she couldn't eat it.  By that time, we had been in the restaurant for over 3 hours, and we were done.  We asked for the check so we could leave, and the girls ordered cheesecakes to go.  I put $60 cash in the billfold along with my credit card to cover the $117 check.  They took the billfold and when they brought it back, they had taken the $60 in cash and neatly hidden it behind the checks, and charged the whole thing to the credit card.  I am not positive, but it sure felt like they were intentionally trying to have us leave the cash.  We signed the bill and left, and we took the cash with us.  Overall, this was the worst experience I have had in a nice restaurant in a very long time.  The food and the service were in no way good enough to warrant a $117 check.  I will not be returning to ANY cheesecake factory, and I will be posting a poor review on as many review sites as I can to save others from this aggravation and disappointment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=520

You have a qutie a few spots around the restauarant, but you also have the option to park on the Southcenter Mall parking lot. Very convenient Me and my friend went on a Monday night, and it was super busy. That was expected, because the restaurant just opened 3 days earlier The service was good. Not great. There was like 3 people attending to us, which was kind of awkard.  I got the Luau Salad. For some reason, it tasted better when i took a bite from my friends salad back at Bellevue's Cheesecake factory. However, as i type thisk review, I'm eating the leftovers. LOL, it tastes better the second time around. The strawberry lemonade i got was great the first time around, however the second time around was disgustingly sweet. Me and my friend got the Banana Cream Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake....HEAVENLY... gahhh Other than the inconsistent food, I could always count on the cheesecake being really good..

Daniel Z.,"Tacoma, WA",54,123,16,1.0,1/5/2009,"I have been to this location once, and it was my first time eating at the place. It was crowded and we had to wait probably 30 minutes before we got a table. That's was the good part of the evening. We get seated and take a look at the menu, it looked okay, some good things, but I didn't feel overwhelmed with great choices. We took probably 10 minutes to decide what we wanted but then had to wait at least 20 minutes before our order was taken. When we finally put our order in we started talking amongst ourselves just having a good time. Nearly 30 minutes after we put our order in the waiter comes back and asks what I ordered again, I tell her. Twenty minutes after that they bring out food out, keep in mind this is nearly 60 minutes after we sat down, and 30 since we ordered. They bring three meals out and my two friends meals are just as they ordered. Mine... not even close, I ordered a sandwich and it was some sort of pasta with ingredients I can't eat. They take it back and say they will get what I ordered. My friends start eating and at this point I haven't eaten all day so I am sharing the food they got. Without stretching the truth, 45 minutes after they brought my friends food I get my food. Nearly two hours after ordering I get my sandwich. It takes another 30 minutes to get our cheesecake. We are going on about 3 hours since we sat down, I have seen the table behind us sit down, get their food, eat, and leave... twice... This was by far the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant. The food I ordered was okay but my friends food was better.

Cheesecake Factory has always been a favorite place of ours for Ribeye Steaks and of course CHEESECAKES. We were seated within a few minutes of walking in the door on a very busy Thursday night. The place was packed with many large groups celebrating birthdays. Our waitress immediately came to the table and introduced herself and got our drink order. We had our two daughters with us both of whom are under 6 years old. Both girls got a special plate with bananas and both types of bread both where perfectly sliced for kids! We where VERY happy with that distraction. Our food was very good and the steaks were a perfect medium as requested. The Onion Rings are mind blowing and everyone walked away full and happy. Both girls were offered two scoops of ice cream or a Hot Fudge Sundae.

Anisia H.,"Seattle, WA",38,26,,3.0,4/16/2008,"Dine smart. If you enjoy the food at The Cheesecake Factory, do one of three things. 1.  Arrive when they open Sunday mornings for brunch.   The Cheesecake Factory offers a great brunch menu Sundays only, and of course the regular menu is available.  We arrived 5 minutes prior to opening, walked in with other early birds and enjoyed no wait, choice table, finished our meal and left as the herds started piling in the entry waiting area.  This is an EXCELLENT time to go with large groups or young children. 2.  Order take-out.   You've seen them while you were waiting for your dine-in table.  Those folks who called ahead or stopped in, placed their order for some pasta, came in to the cheesecake counter and left with their food before you even made it to the top of the wait list.  Most often, poor, inattentive service at any restaurant can ruin a meal of good food.  Skip the risk on service and take-out!  Get your dinner and go. 3.  Order curbside.   Like take-out but a little more convenient.  You can call ahead and not even leave your car!  This is perfect if you have young children and its troublesome to take them in and out of car seats to enter a storefront for some takeout.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tukwila-2?start=540

Everything from a northwest flair to southern feel to eastern taste. Their corporate chefs are earning their bucks that's for sure.  I might also add that if you are planning on stopping by, go outside of 'normal dinner hours'. The wait will be really bad. Yes the hostess will always tell you 15 minutes but come on people... that almost never happens.  I need to make specific recommendations here... they were that good! Try the Veggie spring roll with the avocado and this sweet nutty sauce was amazing and enough for 4 people. I had the a chicken dish... which for me is a bit odd since I like to try things I can't make myself, but this was the one listed as ""most popular chicken dish"" and I can see why!! With a sweet and savory sauce, asparagus, cheese and mashed potatoes... you might need to get your tush into the gym after this one. Of course we saved room for cheese cake and took some left-overs home but splitting a piece of the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake was sounding pretty good. I could have done with out the 2 cups of whipped cream the piled on the plate but with something like 30 options to choose from there is something for everyone... even if you don't like cheesecake.
