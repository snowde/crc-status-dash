Robert T.,"Santa Barbara, CA",29,36,20,4.0,1/6/2018,"My wife and i have visited this location twice since it opened, once for lunch and once for dinner. The service and food for the lunch was fantastic, and although the food at dinner was great, the experience wasn't as good. We were prepared to wait an hour as we were preoccupied at a nearby store, and once seated we were pleased to see they didn't squeeze the 2 person tables so closely together like other locations. Steak tacos were fantastic, as were the fried mac and cheese. Unfortunately our entree's took a very long time to come, to the extend that the party next to us who hadn't sat much before us, had left as our entree's arrived. Also our server seemed under a lot of pressure, which led to it taking a long time for us to pay. Finally, we were never offered cheesecake at the end, as our server was rushed to have us pay. We'll be back, but perhaps not during peak hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia
Steve A.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,7,,2.0,1/11/2018,"I do not recommend ordering food for take out from this restaurant. My wife ordered over the phone and was told it would be ready in 20 min. I arrived within 20 min. and 25 minutes later the server came out and collected my credit card and came back with my order. She didn't go over the order with me and left. I looked in the bag and immediately determined they forgot the desert so I had to go into the restaurant. Frightfully, she looked at the bakery counter and knew she had forgotten the desert. I remained calm, thanked her and headed home.  Upon my arrival, my wife said I was gone for over an hour. We are only 10 minutes away. She opened up the food items and discovered that they also forgot the dressing for the salad and the French fry's with the shrimp dinner. There was a one teaspoon size cup of tarter sauce. I gave two stars because the food was better then the service. However, we will never return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia
Chris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,122,24,1.0,1/5/2018,"Slow service. Really loud atmosphere. Missing order. Since there was no parking right up front, I dropped my family off to get a table while I went and parked the car. To my surprise they were seated right away. It took me a little more than ten minutes to park the car and find where my family was seated. When I got to the table I told them that I was surprised they were seated at a table so soon and asked them if they got the drink order. They said no one has come around to take the drink orders. That is when I looked at my watch to see the time. It took the staff at least ten minutes after I sat down to take our drink order. This was more than 20 minutes from the time my family was first seated. We finally placed our order and tried to have a conversation, but the place is really loud and I had a hard time hearing. Needless to say we did not talk much. When the food came out, it came out at different times which usually is not a problem. My daughter ordered angel hair pasta and green beans, but only the green beans made it to our table in time for dinner. After waiting for five minutes for the pasta to come out, we just gave her some of our pasta from our plates so she could start eating. After some time they finally brought out the pasta, which was dry (an indication of sitting out too long before being brought to our table). We told them to forget about the pasta order as we were done eating and would like the check and some boxes. The server just left it on the table and walked away. Since I told them I did not wan the pasta because it was too late, I assumed that I would not have been bill for the item. It seemed like too much of a hassle to try to have the item removed, that I just paid the bill and left.  Side note, one thing I did notice was that some of the men preparing the food had beards, but they were not wearing the required beard nets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia

Peter H.,"Los Angeles, CA",513,528,3720,2.0,12/2/2017,As a shareholder of CAKE I periodically evaluate this investment by visiting a location. For this instance it was not so good but since the place was packed it's more important to see the business doing well. People love the Cheesecake Factory. It has a lot of mediocre menu items but the real revenue maker is the cheese cake. What a great margin on these slices of pure profit. Even though I had bad service and ok food I don't care. Everyone else seems to love it and that's the important thing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia
Hannah R.,"Valencia, CA",3,61,67,2.0,11/15/2017,"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before where it takes 30+ minutes to get a drink and an hour to get food. The first time I was here, the drinks weren't a problem but it took forty five minutes to get my food (which was mediocre at best at the time). That was a year ago. Today, we had a party of five. Our waiter was training, which we were all cool with, but our biggest problem was waiting for our food again. It took an hour and it was busy enough that it wasn't empty but not enough to wait the hour. The food was all correct, which was great, but this location needs to work on it since it's a regular thing. It took half an hour to get my drink since it was coming from the bar and I had to ask three or four times for a drink in general. If you decide to go here, I would just expect that you're going to be here for a few hours. I think it's great that Santa Clarita has more options for restaurants now, but service kind of falls on the low end in general with a few exceptions. They are very kind at this location, but also very slow. I'd just pick your battles and weigh your options on whether on not you have that kind of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia
John D.,"Valencia, CA",18,16,,5.0,12/21/2017,"My brother and I came for a little post workout feeding at lunch the other day.  There was no wait even with the busy shopping season. The patio seating is beautiful and one of the best places in SCV for people watching.  I always get the same thing at CF, the spicy cashew chicken over broccoli, (no rice) but I was feeling a little saucy and opted for the breakfast burrito.   It was delicious. The whole experience was great.  Our server was Sarah Rose.  She was attentive, engaging and funny.  It was a pleasant surprise to have a server with such a winning personality.  She made the lunch even more perfect.  All in all, this CF is a winner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia
Mike O.,"Santa Clarita, CA",611,616,1097,3.0,6/27/2017,"So we came in for Happy Hour at 5:50 and saw that it ends at 6:00...most places have Happy Hour until 7:00 so I wasn't happy with that, but our waitress, Lauren V, was really good about telling us she would make sure it was covered during the lower costs. We ordered items only from the Happy Hour menu, burgers and fries for me and my son and Vietnamese Spring Rolls for my wife plus an order of the cheesy bread, two beers (Sam Adams and Blue Moon) and then at the end my wife and son split a slice of cheesecake. Service with Lauren was great and she was friendly and attentive the whole time we were there which is good because I saw from most of the reviews that service was an issue. A bad item that I brought to her attention was that there were a couple (three total) utensils on the table that had food crud on them.  I took a picture of two, but she was not happy with it and was very apologetic.  Honestly the food and her service would bring me back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia

Jenny P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,11,1.0,12/24/2017,Worst experience at a cheesecake EVERR. No wonder why they have such a bad rating. Such a waste of money and time on christmas eve. Serious let down. Horrible service. The manager doesn't know how to accommodate for terrible service and the terrible food. Server carlos was so rude and sighed in front of our faces when asked to remake the thai wrap that was over AND under cooked on the same plate. Carbonara was bland but oddly with too much pepper... mind boggling how they managed to do that. Then decided to order a steak diane instead which came out completely over cooked on one side like they forgot about it.

After a full year open they seem to finally be getting things under control. (We had our food sent back and returned 5x before getting it right the first time we were there, in early 2017, but a recent visit shows that an upward trend may be on the horizon!)

Monica F.,"Canyon Country, CA",68,6,2,1.0,1/1/2018,"Worst experience ever at a Cheesecake Factory. This place is horrible we were sitting over 10 minutes for a glass of water. Finally my husband walked up the bar to get me a cup of water. While waiting for our very slow server a couple sitting across from us after waiting too, just got up and left our server and a bus boy get the utensils and napkins just put them back in place after the other people touched them. They did not switch them out. My glass and knife were dirty. When I asked for a manager to request they change out the silverware and telling him I don't trust the cleanliness of the restaurant. He just got upset with me and said I assure you we are clean. I said you can not assure me of that so I decided to leave after 25 minutes are food had still not even come out.

We ordered filet mignon, stuffed mushrooms and their pumpkin pie cheesecake (seasonal). First off the filet mignon was cooked exactly as ordered. I I wish the portion size for the veggies was a bit bigger but nevertheless it was the perfect portion to share. I honestly have never been a fan of mushrooms but am now! They were cheesy and garlicky. The pumpkin pie cheesecake was so tasty. It was the perfect combination of pie and cheesecake.

Maximus Decimus Meridius M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",12,92,1,1.0,8/28/2017,"Came here last night for dinner with family members visiting from out of town.   I put our name in at 5.15pm for a party of 6.  I was told the wait would be ""45 minutes."" After watching several parties come in 30 minutes after us who were seated before us i finally started haranguing the hostess.  At 6:26pm we were taken to our table but wait!! Not so fast starving exhausted customers!!  the table wasn't ready. so we had to stand there another 5 minutes while someone set the table.   But the most incredible part of this story is that there were THREE empty booths that could hold six people that were all empty right next to our designated table.  How long were they empty?  not sure but the odds of 3 empty large adjacent booths opening up at precisely the same time are non-existent.   Here's a helpful hint.  Whatever wait time the hostess quotes you multiply by 2. See other reviewers with similar wait time disasters (emily b review). what's the solution?? Another restaurant that also serves cheesecake for desert?

Noemy G.,"Newhall, CA",0,9,1,1.0,12/28/2017,"*****will not be going back until someone fixes the service /manager at this location **** I would give it zero stars if i could, by far this is the worst cheesecake factory i've been to the service is terrible, the manager isn't great at all either and neither are the waiters here if you can dodge this bullet i suggest you do. We waited for a good while then after we got seated and got our food our waiter never checked on us again we had the busboy and other people ask us if we needed anything which was more drinks. Our waiter completely disregarded us and would check on everyone around us but us when we needed more water and soda, we were waiting on him about 30 minutes just so we could flag him down to come back and give us refills and bread or cheese but he never came, it got to the point where i just got myself up and walked up to see if anyone could refill our drinks because i was getting impatient. After we got our drinks and ate our food we had to flag him down for boxes and after he did he completely disappeared again and we just got up and went to the front for our check, apparently our server was all the way in the front chitty chatting with his co-workers and i presume that is the reason why this person couldn't do a good job so after we paid we wanted to speak to the manager and once we found him he completely disappeared we were waiting a good 15-20 minutes for him and he completely disappeared. The food was also okay nothing compared to Sherman oaks in my fettuccine i had pieces of burned fish tail which was odd because i had gotten the chicken not shrimp. Overall, i hope someone takes a look into this restaurant that actually cares and fixes the problem not only with the waiters but also the manager for not showing intreast in paying customers *******(keep in mind we went on December 27th  just in case anyone cares to have a talk with the staff or manager)***** ***************we have also gone to other cheesecake factories that are relatively more packed than this one and the service is amazing (really recommend the cheesecake factory in Sherman oaks its a drive but you'll actually be treated well and not regret it *****",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia

Alex A.,"Canyon Country, CA",151,6,,5.0,1/7/2018,"Although I'm not a fan of chains at all, Cheesecake Factory does a pretty good job being what they are. They have a giant menu, hats off to the BOH staff for their consistent execution on such a large menu. Service is always great. We have had Megan as our server a few times and she is great. Her attention to detail, friendliness and menu knowledge is above and beyond the basic job requirements and we felt she really went out of her way to make sure we enjoyed our experience. I would rather support small local businesses but it's a pretty good spot to go to when you can decide what you want since they have a little of everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=20

Jay B.,"Orange County, CA",586,77,748,4.0,1/7/2017,"Finally, the long awaited Cheesecake Factory has opened in SCV (11/8/16). It's definitely a great addition to this city and the nearby areas. Located near the Valencia Mall entrance and across Urban Home this particular restaurant is smaller than the rest of the other Cheesecakes but just right for the city.  I came here on a Wed with friends for a random visit and since it's still new there was of course a wait. We decided to just dine at the bar and sit at the bar top since all tables were full in the bar area. It took about 8 mins to be acknowledged by our server but I get it she was busy with the hustle and bustle of everything. Once recognized we were then accommodated with a friendly smile and a great attitude.  Dining at Cheesecake many times throughout the years at several locations you still find yourself looking at the menu to see what they have new and appetizing. Obviously there are a great selection of food items on their menu that are all reasonably priced and still to this day, if I cannot decide on anything else I always order one of my favorite dishes there which is the Spicy Cashew Chicken(16.95). This is actually the first item I ordered when I dined @ Cheesecake for the first time in the early 90s. This particular dish at this location  was good but very salty. The ratio of chicken vs rice was okay and everything else was smaller in portions than the other locations.  Aside from this I also opted for a fresh Kale salad w/ grilled chicken(14.45). This was actually very refreshing and satisfying considering the Spicy Chicken that I usually get was salty. So this salad was a good balance for my palate. And to wash this down of course you have to have a cold brew. Stella is my main choice (7.00). My friends ordered the California Cheesesteak sandwich(13.95). A good size sandwich that is not too greasy nor oily and very flavorful.  Of course you cannot leave Cheesecake without ordering desserts so we got the Godiva Chocolate and Dulce De Leche(7.95). The overall service was good and our server at the bar top was very friendly and attentive. I'm definitely sure if we decided to get a table our wait time would be long as well. Again, this is definitely a great addition to this location and hopefully it will continue to provide good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=20
Amir A.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",13,5,,1.0,12/27/2017,"I can't speak for other Cheesecake Factory restaurants or for other times of the week, but for this one in Valencia, CA, on a Wednesday evening, the service was painfully slow after a wait for a table that exceeded the 40-min estimate by at least 10 min. The food was ok, and the portions were decent, but there was a good 15 min between when three of us got our meals and when the other three got theirs. All in all, a pretty negative experience that seemed to be business-as-usual for this place.  Our waitress barely recognized the molasses-slow service, much less apologized or tried to make it right.  The food was decent but not good enough to justify ridiculously long waits for both the table and the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=20

The staff has always been polite to me/my gf, on point with refilling drinks, the food arrives within 10-20 min (we've never had a ridiculously long wait, even when crowded), and the food always tastes good. Sure, I prefer some dishes over others, but I've still always found the food enjoyable. I don't think we've ever had a problem here. Maybe we have a much different experience because we come as a small party of 2? Anyways, I think the ONLY bad thing I can think of is that it gets crowded here. Sometimes the wait to get in is over 30 minutes. Sometimes there are so many people inside the restaurant, it gets noisy.

They aren't very spicy, but occasionally you'll find a spicy chili. A small side of pico de gallo and guacamole complemented the dish well.  The crispy can wontons are a good choice if you like crab. You can taste the crab because there's actually a decent amount of crab in the wonton. The food arrived piping hot and freshly made. I only tried a couple of things during my visit, but I find the food to be prepared the same across their locations.

Ronald M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1909,534,1471,4.0,11/29/2016,"This place was highly anticipated in the SCV. And after just a few weeks since opening, apparently to mixed reviews, we thought it would be a nice outing for dinner. We weren't looking for anything too fancy tonight, although today marks our 35th Anniversary! We're saving the splurge for our trip to one of our very favorite destinations at the end of next week. But more on that in future posts. So after arriving around 6:15, we could see there would be a bit of a wait, as evidenced by those waiting outside. I love the look of this place, very nice decor. I've only been to one other Cheesecake Factory, the one in Marina Del Rey and that was quite some years ago.  We were given a wait time of 20 minutes, and after given a pager it wasn't long before a few seats were vacated in the lobby waiting area and we swiftly moved to grab them. Which was fortunate, our 20 minute wait turned out to be more like 35. Our server was Michael, and he seemed nice enough. A little forgetful with our bread though.  Our orders were as follows: RASPBERRY LEMONADE: My wife wanted to try this weird tasting concoction; think powdered drink mix in a straw popular during your childhood days. Don't do it! Don't order this bitter/sweet mess! She had Michael bring her a Sprite instead, I ordered a root beer. 1 Star PORTOBELLO, AVOCADO and ZUCCHINI FRIES: As an appetizer, these were really good. We could have done without the avocado fries though, they just weren't doing it for us. With two dipping sauces. The ranch sauce was all that was needed. 4.5 Stars BREAD: Decent, after reminding Michael that we didn't get any and finally having it brought to our table. The butter could have been less chilled, makes for better spreading. 3.5 Stars FILET MIGNON: Her entree, which came with mashed potatoes and green beans. Prepared well done, she was very pleased with her choice. 4.5 Stars SHEPHERDS PIE: My entree. Decent, but I probably wouldn't order it again. My wife makes one much better. The peas and carrots were there, topped with mashed potatoes of course. But I would have much preferred ground beef rather than the chunks of beef that came with this dish. 3 Stars SERVICE: No real complaints that a bit more time and experience couldn't correct no doubt. They all seem to be trying very hard to get it right. 3.5 Stars We'll be back. Have to order some cheesecake eventually! More on our real anniversary celebrations in about a week and a half.

Frank R.,"Saugus, CA",11,369,198,2.0,9/25/2017,"Man, it's so sad to slam our local Cheesecake Factory but it's well deserved. I'm a believer in the low cumulative score that they got for this restaurant. My reviews are for restaurants only!  This last Sunday was my familys first time and  impression and my last straw and we'll never return for dining. I've been here many times with many different groups and we just get let down one time after another, simple failure from the hostesses to the server. There is a serious lack of good management, at least this last Sunday at 8pm, 9/24/2017. Looking around, there are a lot of people hustling about but clearly we never seem to be on the service end of that group. With probably fifteen people standing around in the kitchen that I can see, there is no reason why our food came out luke warm and not all at once, I'm not sure if it was the server or failure in the kitchen to make the food all together and stay hot and it was not busy! Over an hour of dining and not once, did we get a refill on water by anyone. It was bad enough to notify corporate but it's not worth it because I'm sure it's not their first similar complaint. Lastly, to all the real hard working employees there, I'm sorry for the sad but justified review.

I finally said I'm good and called it quits. 3rd visit I got my food order but now my drink order was MIA, along with our waitress who required an APB to find. Food is bland, services is horrible, staff less than favorable, no value as the selections are over priced. Nail in the coffin, just found a news report on this location that discovered they along with other locations have a practice of misleading the tip percentages.

Tyler M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,5,,1.0,11/29/2017,I would first like to say that this review goes for not just one time of coming here but for multiple times.... so it wasn't just one isolated time.  Went here over the weekend after going a few times after it first opened and had horrible service and food was just ok. Definitely not up to standards of Cheesecake Factory.  We had to ask for water 3 times and still did not get them so I finally went up to the bar and ask again only to then be shorted two waters (which never arrived). Food came out at different times... I mean 5 mins between each set of plates bc our server only would bring two at a time(we had a party of 8). So people who got food first were almost done when last two got their food. We ordered drinks and the drink order got messed up severely both times (we had a $150 bar tab on 10 drinks so you would expect them to at least get drinks right). Just overall bad service every time we have been and it's so sad bc we were so happy to get a Cheesecake Factory where we live finally.  Overall I would suggest go to another restaurant.

Steve F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/15/2017,"Beware of Hairy Meals, poor service & lack of leadership. I have been a customer of Cheesecake Factory for many years and have eaten at many locations throughout California & In Las Vegas.  Having one in Santa Clarita was great news when it opened. During the first few weeks this location had a lot of issues but I let it go since most restaurants need time to work out the kinks. However, it is worse. Today one person in the party had a long hair in her meal. The staff said they would replace it only it took a long time. When correcting a problem the order should be expedited. Orders were wrong, took a long time, and the follow up made the multiple problems worse. The manager said he would take the HAIRY MEAL off the bill. Gee thanks!How about a deep discount and some cheesecake for the trouble given we were a large group celebrating two birthdays? Bottom line this location has very poor service, food   is not up to par with the Cheesecake Factory brand, food safety is not up to standards, and management had every opportunity to make things right and they missed the mark. Are other locations like this?  Corporate if your listening I recommend you take a real close look at this operation and maybe get a leader from one of your better locations to take over and save this location. Until such time my advice is to not waste your time, money or health.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=20

Lucky S.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,1154,3373,3.0,4/24/2017,"Let me start by saying I love me some Cheesecake Factory.  They have my favorite all time salad ever...a Chinese chicken salad, minus the chicken, add grilled salmon.  The dressing for it has the best mixture of tang and sweet. The lettuce is perfectly chopped, the sliver of almonds and wonton chips add crunch and it's a huge portion so I usually ask for dressing on the side and take half of it home so I have lunch leftovers the next day. This Cheesecake Factory served a great salad like all the others I've had, but when we arrived, the place was pretty dead (it was 4:30 so before the dinner rush).  There were plenty of sections open to seat us at, but took as to an empty row of tables.  Sitting down, I was fine with that since I'm anti-social at heart and I like my space.   BUT once I looked under the table to set my purse down, I noticed that the floor was disgusting.  There were crumbs all over and the next table over was the same with the addition of cheerios.  Looking around, there were plenty of staff chit chatting and such so it wasn't an issue of available staff.  Just no one cared enough to clean it.   Normally I would have asked to be moved, but it was already mid service once I noticed and not worth the hassle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=20

Emily B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",85,20,19,1.0,8/27/2017,"This location is nothing like any Cheesecake Factory I've been to before. Honestly, Cheese Mistake Factory might be a better name. I've been three times, and each time they've found some new and exiting way to spoil my meal.  First Visit: The debit card reader won't accept our card, so my husband had to walk down the street in the dark to get cash. Mind you, the card was working fine everywhere else, so it was clearly an error on the restaurant's part. I expected at least some of our meal to be comped for the trouble, but it wasn't. On the other hand, our waiter was great even though they were wildly understaffed so our food and drinks took a long time to get to the table.  Second Visit: I make a reservation for 12 people. When we arrive, we're told ""Sorry, we don't have you in the system."" I'd even double checked to make sure I was calling the right location, so this wasn't a mistake on my end.  Third / Final Visit: We arrive at 5:11; the wait is approximately 45 minutes. That's perfect because we have already bought movie tickets for 7:00. At 6:00, we double check to see how long it's going to be and the hostess explains that a few parties are ahead of us still, but that a ""bunch"" of tables are being cleaned off. For the next 20 minutes, we watched about four other parties get seated before us, some of who arrived after we did. At 6:25, I explained that we had movie tickets and the hostess said they'd seat us right away. At this point, we're just hoping to get to the movie before the previews end. Five minutes later, we still weren't seated so we told the hostess to pull our names from the list. This was close to twice the original wait time we were given. If they'd just given is a realistic expectation we could have gotten food elsewhere instead of going to our movie hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=20

At the 1 hour and 20 minute mark we asked again, and we got the same rehearsed response ""they are cleaning off a table for you right now!"" Which wasn't true.   At the 1 hour and 30 mark we had to decide if we wanted to eat, or see the movie we already purchased tickets for. We chose the movie and left. If the hostess had been honest, we would have chosen a different restaurant and been able to enjoy dinner with our good friends. Evening ruined.  I have now been to Cheesecake Factory 3 times. Each time they have managed to make major mistakes. The last time I went, we didn't receive our drinks until after our meal. Unreal!

Zoey W.,"Valencia, CA",64,209,554,2.0,2/25/2017,"Oh, what a difference a couple of months makes... We came back to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch today and was really disappointed at the horrendously long wait times for service and food.  We arrived right at opening (11:30 am) and there was already a line to get in.  Once we were seated, it took our server about 15 minutes to take our drink orders.  Granted, she also had a large group of 10 people to deal with, but that is when a competent manager should have taken charge. Although our server was apologetic about the long wait, that did not make the wait any more bearable.  We waited 45 minutes for our appetizer of Chicken Pot Stickers and another 20 minutes for our entrees of Miso Salmon and Steak Diane.  While the Miso Salmon was cooked perfectly, they charged an additional $2 for a ""side"" of asparagus, which consisted of four tiny thin asparagus spears.  Really??? We finally managed to get out of there at 1:10 pm.  That's 1 hour and 40 minutes for lunch!!  I can understand the long wait times if we went on a Friday or weekend, but we went on a Thursday. I think someone at the Cheesecake Factory Corporate Office needs to visit this Valencia location and audit their staffing and performance standards.  They also need to discuss this ongoing problem with the General Manager and, if needed, replace him or her with someone who is competent and knows how to manage a high-volume restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=40

Tiffany H.,"Calabasas, CA",170,188,366,2.0,6/5/2017,"I am SO utterly disappointed with this location! First off, I mainly had an issue with the food here. The service was not bad, but I felt like the manager could have been more accommodating.  I came here expecting to have an amazing dinner but turned out to be a bit of a disaster. We sat outside on the patio which was great. Our waitress was pretty attentive so no problems there. I ordered the four cheese pasta because that is my go-to-dish. I've never had a four cheese pasta go wrong. BOY was I wrong about that decision. The pasta got to me and was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten. Imagine ocean water in your pasta. That's what it felt like when my tongue was stinging from the salt. I normally don't like to complain because I feel bad, but I had to say something. Our server kindly apologized and asked me to choose another menu item because the sauces are all pre seasoned and made. I figured I would try the fettuccine alfredo because it wasn't a tomato based sauce. OH MAN then this dish came out earlier than the prior! It was also almost the consistency of soup. The minute I saw it sloshing around in the plate I had a bad feeling. I don't know who is testing their sauces but this was about 70% saltier than my four cheese pasta. I flagged our server over again and she asked the manager to come by. He asked me then choose one more dish and didn't really give an apparent answer to the sauce being way too salty. I ended up asking for the salmon with no salt. I was very disappointed by the manager who did less than the server to rectify the situation. She offered me a soup or salad while waiting for my food to be remade but I felt he could've really stepped up and offered us a complimentary cheesecake, or removed the dish from the bill for all our troubles and waiting around for the food to be fixed. It completely ruined the pace of our meal with me having to change three entrees. My fiancé and mother in law to be were already done with their entrees and I was still waiting on my food to be fixed without salt. I would've liked to see the manager take more initiative and come back again to make sure everything was okay.

This time around I had purchased to-go, instead of eating in, and the salad I got was like a quarter of the size it was last time. Why do I get less if I order to-go? That does not make sense to me.  The crab bites were also very small and only came with a few. And my boyfriend got the BBQ burger, which he said was ok for the price, and he was also super upset to find a hair in his fries.

Danielle G.,"Valencia, CA",445,662,275,3.0,11/29/2016,"They are definitely still working out their kinks. In the land of chain restaurants, I've always wondered why a Cheesecake factory didn't come to SCV sooner. They have a prime location  within Valencia Town Center and have a popular following so I think they will stick around for some time. Compared to other Cheesecake locations, this one is relatively small inside, and they tried to make up for it with the patio area. Long wait times are going to be a given for the next few months here.  We came late on a week night and were able to snag a seat at the bar. Shout out to our bartender that night (should've gotten her name) because she was holding it down for the entire bar.  If you've been to other locations, you know to expect large portions and a diverse menu. It is the same here. Our flatbread was good. Our drinks were made well.  A couple of hiccups we observed:  -Tell me why it took the longest time to just get some bread.  -The party next to us complained about the wait time on their food and then one of the dishes came out completely wrong.  ...like I said, they are working out the kinks. Since we were sitting at the bar, we observed the bartenders and servers, and we could see they were definitely trying their best.

Adrian P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,1.0,11/17/2017,"It's very easy for me to write bad reviews because I have been in the restaurant industry for 15 years. I am currently 31. I've done everything from busing tables, hosting, bartending, Sous chef etc. that being said, let's get started Is the wait staff here having pre shift meetings? If so, why are your servers telling your customers that they indeed do have certain menu items when 30 min later we are told they no longer have the ingredients? We ordered some flat bread with sausage that they had on their menu when they first opened. The server assured us that they could still make it. Great! He came back 15 min later to tell us it would taste slightly different because they don't have all the ingredients. 30 min later he told us they no longer have any of the ingredients to make the flat bread. Don't let your servers sell something that isn't available. You will avoid upsets like this one my family and I had to go through.  I asked our server how long he had worked at this Cheesecake Factory. He said since they opened. Great. I asked him to recommend something to me. He recommended the habachi steak with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. Let me tell you something about this dish or two or three or four or 5.  Ho wow. Salty as the Black Sea. That sauce on the steak was way over reduced. I ordered the steak medium. It was far from it. Well done and burnt and dry. The wasabi mashed potatoes tasted like regular potatoes. When I told our server he said he would get me new potatoes. He came back with wasabi butter and told me that it's what they put in the potatoes. Wonderful. Maybe your chef should taste everything going out of his kitchen so that I or anyone else doesn't have to get a side of wasabi butter and make their own wasabi mashed potatoes.  I really didn't want to come eat here but it was my sister in laws birthday. The reason why I didn't want to eat here is because the last time I came to eat here was with my wife and her 85 year old grandmother who had to wait over 2 hrs for our meal. They said they couldn't find the order 3 times. That brigade system seems to be keeping Cheesecake Factory at 3 stars at any location.  The worst part of all of this people is that nothing was offered to be compensated. Having worked at multiple restaurants I have always taken pride in any position I had. I can tell you that if there was ever a complaint the mangers would take care of a bill especially if you had to wait over 2 hours to get food. It's a nice environment but servers lack of knowledge, slow service, and under seasoned/over seasoned food shows lack of leadership from the executive chef and the GM. It's that food that screams to me ""I don't give a damn about you"" kinda food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=60

They open at 11:30 a.m. For lunch during the week and there is a line of people waiting to get in every day. I went to order some take-out food today. While I was waiting in line, I noticed the bar was empty. I asked one of the workers if they serve lunch at the bar... *yess* no wait! I ordered Bang Bang Chicken. I believe you can also get this dish prepared with shrimp. I have had this dish at the San Francisco, California location. They cut up pieces of chicken,  mix in curry sauce, and put in sliced carrots, and green peas. In the middle of the plate is a mound of rice. You can choose from white or brown rice. Every cheesecake factory has like 250 menu items, so everybody should be able to find something they like on the menu. When you look at the menu, you will see pizza, sandwiches, hamburgers, salads, soups, asian dishes, fish items...  That's a tall order for most restaurants.

Josh R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",119,52,4,3.0,9/9/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  I have never, ever had even a slightly negative experience at any location.  I don't go very often because they don't take reservations, but when I get a chance to eat there, I know I can always count on phenomenal food. I'm so disappointed to say, that after working so hard to get one in our town, I have never been more disappointed with the food in any restaurant in this town.  I sent a text to my brother right after I ordered my appetizer, so I had a time stamp.  15 minutes later I ordered my entrée.  I normally get the 4 cheese pasta, but I was craving a steak so I ordered a ribeye.  The manager came out and apologized that something went wrong with their entire batch of mashed potatoes, so I told him that I'm happy to eat French fries instead.  Then 30 minutes in we also put our dessert order in.  Soon after I received my ribeye, but no appetizer.  I asked about the appetizer and was trying to decide if I even wanted it at this point.  They said they would take my steak and put it back under the heat lamp as opposed to offering to make me a new one like a high end restaurant would have.  I'm so glad I kept the appetizer because it really was good.  Then they brought me the steak back out, but without the ketchup I ordered for the fries and without a knife to cut the steak.  Eventually I got both.  The fries were cold and the steak was very similar to cardboard.  Our server was great and kept trying to make it better.  He immediately replaced my cold fries with hot soggy fries.  Saw that I couldn't take a bite of the steak without gagging so he offered to replace it as well.  I didn't want to be a complainer, so I just had him take it away.  Finally I agreed to order my usual, the 4 cheese pasta, because it is so consistent.  In the meantime our dessert got there and it was pretty good.  Then my pasta got there several minutes later.  It was like tomato soup because there was so much sauce and the noodles were so overcooked, they were like mush.  I was embarrassed that I had complained, so I really wanted to just pay and leave, so I could go get dinner somewhere.   To be honest it was a 1 star experience at most.  I gave another star because our server was so good and the manager was also so polite and helpful during a terrible dining experience.  The 3rd star is because they did make it as right as they could.  I wasn't charged for the appetizer that took nearly 40 minutes to come out, or either of my terrible entrées.  Other than that, I'm going to give them at least a year before I return to give it a second try, if I ever go to any Cheesecake Factory again.  If such a phenomenal company would let their kitchen be so undertrained and mismanaged, it makes me wonder if the other locations have lowered their standards as well.

It seems like it's such a perfect fit for this town... Yet we got a Tilted Kilt before...  It's Cheesecake Factory. You've been to one before. They have a novel for a menu and tons of cheesecakes (SURPRISE!). Their food is actually good compared to other chain restaurants, but the prices are slightly higher.  Yes, the wait is long at times... It's Cheesecake Factory. You're going to wait 1+ hours to get seated at peak hours. Deal with it. I've come at this location twice since they opened. First time, we came at around dinner time and waited over an hour to be seated. No complaints... We just window-shopped all around the stores near the place. The second time we went, we came at around 11am on Saturday and there was no wait. So yes, plan ahead and know that you will wait during peak hours (common sense).  Yes, the lighting sucks at night. Most restaurants have crap lighting. Why? It camouflages the food when it gets served to you. Is it a trick? Yep. Does it bother you? Come here during the day when there's natural light coming through the gigantic windows or bring a flash light.  The service was normal.

You need a better system!!! After we were seated we ordered I drinks and mine took 10 min to get annoying !!! Food was good the put the wrong dressing on my salad but she made up for that. Took so long to get a refill and my boyfriend pasta was cold and they gave him the lunch size portion instead of dinner. I really hope you work on these issues cause we do really like eating there  The manager later has reached out to us and made us feel better about coming back and trying them again  Even though the manager tried the service is horrible along with the take out window being very slow.

Kasey L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",321,4,1,1.0,9/3/2017,"I'll start this by saying I am soooo disappointed. I LOVED Cheesecake Factory until this visit. I came here for my friends 21st birthday with a few other friends, 7 of us total. I get it was busy and there are a few of us, I'm a server myself so I understand how it goes. I've never had bad service like this before. Hear me out. The server that originally greeted us was short and rude, she asked us if we were splitting checks and how we were doing so, we explained we would be splitting it a couple of ways then she passed us over to another server with a small introduction. We had another friend join us which we had notified the server of prior. The first server explained rudely that we messed up her rotation for splitting the checks. OK? I would never tell a table that by adding another guest, they messed up ""my rotation"" I wouldn't make them feel bad for celebrating a birthday. Anyways. Our food came out but half of it was cold and didn't taste good. One of the girls asked for the pasta taken off the bill because she didn't like it. She didn't even touch it because it was so cold. The new server stated she would get a manager to come over. To be fair, the new server was very sweet. The birthday girl ordered a fried appetizer and the server mentioned the fryer wasn't frying but other people had gotten their fried apps at our table so she said she'd check. Never updated us, just brought out the app way later. We continued to wait. Drinks were hardly refilled and our server came out to us maybe two times total, we waited SO long for everything. Like I said, I get it's busy but come on. Luckily Lauren and Justin, two servers that weren't ours stepped in to take care of us. Saving grace. The server advised she didn't know how we split the check when she finally came back out so we shrugged it off and explained; no problem. The friend that needed the pasta taken off the bill saw that it was still on the bill, the manager had never come out. The server explains he'll come out and leaves. He comes out way later and simply says, ""what's up?"" Like.. what's up? Seriously? My friend explains the situation, he says he took it off the bill and leaves. He seemed peeved and clearly did not care. We had to flag down so many other people to help us, it was literally upsetting. All our silverware was dirty and we never got to order more drinks. I ordered a piece of cheesecake and didn't receive it until way later. We've been here since 7pm and now it's 10:05pm because of how long everything has been taking. Very sad that my friend's 21st birthday was spent at a restaurant that couldn't care less about servicing us. UPDATE: My friend that had the pasta issue asked for a different manager to explain the situation, the same manager came out and shrugged her off again. Told her ""okay we'll try to do better next time"" had to add that in because I just can't believe it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=80

We got avocado egg rolls (which I learned today can be requested to be a lunch portion), bistro shrimp pasta, and Cajun jambalaya pasta. The avocado egg rolls were AMAZING, from the sauce to the warm crunchiness.  ...the pasta? Er-- bland. The bistro shrimp just tasted like noodles that were pathetically under seasoned.

Once we received our waters, we ordered an appetizer salad and a burger to split. We specifically pointed to the burger we wanted on the menu. We received our salad around 10 minutes after placing the order and the salad was dry. Whilst waiting on our dressing and other drinks to come to table, in this 15 minute period we were brought a different burger than one we asked for initially and sent it back. Then, 45 minutes into waiting for a fixed meal, our waitress, Sarah L, was nowhere to be found. Once she came back to our table, we received nothing more than a bad attitude and non-apologetic tone.

The wait staff was incredibly rude on top of everything as well.  The reason the wait is an hour or more for this place is because they work incredibly slow. Not because it's great.

Dean P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",114,808,3353,3.0,1/7/2017,"Eh. We desperately need this restaurant in Santa Clarita and this chain is popular and busy in any city they open. I grew up with this chain living in Orange County so it is not my first time at a Cheesecake Factory. The place is decorated amazing as they always are. Party of 6 Got here at 4:40 on a Friday hoping to avoid the huge wait I have been hearing about...not a chance. The people working are doing their best but it's very hectic and loud at the check in desk. Here's another odd thing, some people get a transponder thing and some give their name. So as it gets busier and louder a hostess is going around trying to find Carmen party of 4 and walking through the crowd...why doesn't Carmen have a transponder? So we are told 30 min wait at roughly 5 pm., ok not too bad I guess. About 45 min later we inquire about our table. We are told our party was assigned a specific table and the people still sitting at that particular table have not left yet...@@..what? Really, is this how it's done? So in the meantime other people who came in after us are being seated.... hardly seems effective. After just about an hour we are seated. The booths are big and comfy but it's very dark in here. When the server comes to your table twice and says, "" I promise your food is coming out soon"", you know you are screwed. It takes way too long for the food but they are crazy busy by now because it's after 6pm. The food is amazing as they always do. Salmon and asparagus was delicious as well as the tuna tataki salad, it was all great, they never disappoint in that area. Total time in the restaurant was 2.5 hours, that's too long for me.

Sleepy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",372,12,3,3.0,12/23/2016,"Okay. Let's establish the fact that this Cheesecake Factory is new. Coming in the beginning month was a little rough, because as with any team, you gotta get in sync. Today is my 7th visit since the opening in Nov. Every OTHER visit was horrible because I expected it to be just like all the others. I ordered my favorite, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it had absolutely no flavor. It was cooked literally in stewed tomatoes. No garlic, no onions and awfully seasoned.  After two attempts, the third time was the charm. I understand that the new cooks and servers were training, so I wasn't too upset. I've meet some of the servers that were working here, but they were mostly trainers from other locations. Some of the regular faces around here now, need to lighten up. They are too stiff, dry and nervous. Relax and have a cool conversation. Just breathe, you'll be fine.  Two weeks later, I ordered the usual and it was again not good. I have been to a lot of different Cheesecake Factory's and it remains in one of my 10 places to eat. This particular location feels like it's going to take awhile to get the formula right, but I have faith.  We are here today 12/23/2016 and our server is Emma. She's young and new and is a ball of fun energy. Let's see if she gets it right. Stay tuned.... Emma was GREAT! She really took care of business. She attended to all the tables in her area and made sure everyone, including us were happy with the food and service.

Server stated manager is aware. We ordered a cheesecake slice to go wondering if they would comp us. Server was like for what?  Really !  I had to state for my long wait for Miso salmon. She checked with manager and they agreed. The server should have authority for such things or checked before coming  back to our table. The parking is horrible nothing convenient about this place. The salmon was delicious as well as the 4 cheese pasta if not craving this. I will stick with Claim Jumpers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=140
Randi M.,"Canyon Country, CA",322,886,151,2.0,12/19/2016,"I came here for my birthday, maybe they are having difficulties because they are still so new.  However, some of the things that happened just make me shake my head.  I came with 3 big dudes and my wife.  They seated us at a a table for 4, which was ridicuously small.  The guys were cramped on one side and they pulled up a chair for the 3rd guy.  I went up to the front and asked why we couldnt have a table for 6, it was a Monday night btw.  Finally, they gave us another table.  Then, the server was so scatterbrained.  She brought 2 pats of butter for so much bread.  We asked for more butter, that took forever.  We thought she was out back churning it herself.  The food was fine, typical ""chain"" fare.  Portions are large.  We shared 2 types of cheesecake and everyone loved them( I'm not a real cheesecake fan).  It is what it is.  It will never be a destination restaurant for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=140
Penelope S.,"Valencia, CA",48,10,,1.0,6/13/2017,Let me start by saying I learned a lesson from this experience. Do not go to Cheesecake Factory if you have a big party or you want to celebrate a special occasion.. Go somewhere more accommodating .. Somewhere that actually gives a shit your going to spend $400-$500 dollars on a family members Birthday. This place needs help in customer service. I'm so frustrated I can't think straight. Complete waste of time and money. We ended up being there for 5 hours ..  For large parties be prepared to wait a LONG time. Not sure where they expect you to wait. Had some drinks in the bar area and I think we had 2 servers cause 1 would ask if we wanted another than a few minutes later another person would ask us the same question and we told them the other person took the order already. Not only did this happen in the bar it also happened at the table as well .. once we sat it took 30-40 minutes to get a glass of wine. Once we ordered another 40 minutes to get the food out to the table. Servers ( I'm thinking we had 2 ) were so confused and could not keep up. Management never once seemed to care nor come out to apologize for anything. They must of been to all of what was going on during these hours we were there.  If it were not for a Birthday several people in the party would of complained. It took forever to get our checks although payment process went by pretty quick.  I'm sickened to think of the money we spent and what a complete waist of time waiting around for all of it. Please be warned. They do not care about their guests. Go somewhere else if you have a large party and want to enjoy your evening celebrating.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=140

Megan E.,"Valencia, CA",50,2,,1.0,6/19/2017,"I have never be motivated to provide negative yelp review on Yelp before but after our most recent family experience at the Cheesecake Factory in Valencia, I am leaving my first.  This past Thursday was my daughters graduation from 6th grade. We asked our daughter where she wanted to eat and she said, "" The Cheesecake Factory"".   I had called two weeks prior to the event as we were expecting a larger crowd along with other families from our school potentially looking to celebrate a lunch at the Cheesecake Factory-so I reached out on two separate occasions  make a reservation and was told, "" We clearly do not do reservations"".  Proactively, I was able to have sister go to the Cheese factory early and hold a position in-line at 10:40 to secure a table for my family.... as it was our understanding ""first come first serve"" to get a table.    Due to graduations the restaurant was extremely busy.  There was about 50 people waiting when the doors opened promptly at 1130 am.  We were the 2nd party to formally check-in with the hostess as we were a party of 11. We were asked if we had a reservation and I said, no.  The Hostess then handed us a pager and said, "" my manager will be right with you"".  We waited at least 10 minutes for the manager to come speak to us to tell us the wait is going to be an hour to an hour and 45 minutes wait due to reservations.  I explained to the manager that I had called last week and was told that "" we don't accept reservations"".  The manager then went on to explain, we were all booked for today last week and were not accepting any more reservations.""   When I called the person never said, "" we are booked and not accepting reservations"", if they did we would have gone somewhere else.   We finally sat down to eat at 11:51 after  we agreed to sit in the patio.  While our waitress was very friendly, it took 30 mins for 1/2 of our party to get their beverages as ordered and at least an hour after we sat down to get our food.  Once we got our food we were told that my husbands order was made wrong and they were remaking the meal-okay I get it.  Once my husbands received his meal, the order was still wrong and he had to wait an additional 15 minutes for his second meal to arrive.  When he did receive the fish tacos again prepared incorrectly with the special Cheesecake factory mayonnaise...  he ended up eating the meal as everyone else was almost finished and we clearly had already spent way too much time at the restaurant along with the fact that he did not wait anymore.   Clearly this lead to a horrible customer experience that clearly involved the management (general manager Troy Andrian and his assistant manager-name unknown) which BOTH failed to accept any responsibility or help mitigate the poor customer experience based on the action of management and it's staff's actions associated with this terrible review.   ""Completely disappointed with this location and the complete lack of accommodation from the General Manager Troy Andrian and his Assistant manager- what a disaster!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=140
Ali R.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,6,1,1.0,6/5/2017,"Let me first say that this is my favorite restaurant and the only reason I chose to come here! This is where I always have my birthday dinners as a tradition and due to the experience I had, what a mistake.  Went there there yesterday for my 21st birthday and it was the worst service and experience that I have ever had at any Cheesecake Factory. The only good thing about the experience that I had was my server, Kenlee.  So at the beginning of the night we sat at the bar, figured get some drinks because I was turning 21, and the drinks were awful. I ordered the Long Island Iced Tea and it was basically like drinking Rum out of the bottle. There was no other taste to it. I had to wait for the ice to melt a bit to make it even semi what I ordered. On the other hand, my dad got the same thing and his was like drinking Lemonade. Clearly there is a discrepancy with the mixture of the drinks and definitely something that needs to be fixed. They should train their bartenders better. When we returned my dad's drink, a lady from the bar came over to question why we were returning it and told us, ""well could be because the ice melted..."" but the drink didn't even come in the same color as mine. His was a yellow-ish color, while mine was a brownish one. Finally they brought him a new one, and at that point, the drink was just as bad because they over did it with the Rum.  When it came time for the food, my mom ordered the Steak Diane medium well, which was great but the potatoes had little flavor, my brother ordered a burger medium well with extra fries, I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp, and my dad ordered the New York Strip Steak well done. My brother had mainly bread when it came to his burger because there was barely any meat and my dad got his New York Steak basically RAW, definitely not how he ordered it. We called the waitress over and told her the problem she took it back and apologized, but when it came back it was the exact same way. At that point we ordered something else for him and that took 45 mins to make, mind you me and my mom and brother were already done with our meal. It was a Sunday night and was not even busy so there should have been NO REASON as to why things were sloppy and took forever. The waitress even mentioned that a well done piece of meat should take approx. 20 mins to make. Eventually the manager came over spoke with us, and ended up going and cooking the new meal himself. At that point we explained the experience to the manager and the disappointment the experience was and he complimented 2 meals, and a cheesecake. That was nice of him, but for the experience that we had unacceptable. The waitress repeatedly apologized and was understanding, but this is the WORST experience I've ever had and have no intentions on returning. I also had to literally yell at the people at my table to talk because the music was so loud.  The manager could have been more accommodating to the situation, had a bit of a pompous attitude, and wanted to have little interaction and solve the problem so he wouldn't have to deal with us anymore.  The experience was horrific to the point where I didn't even want them to sing happy birthday or anything. I should have saved my money and gone somewhere else! I highly recommend if you plan on coming to this establishment go to the one in Glendale, you will be much happier even if having to do the extra drive. I regret coming here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=140

Veronica Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,1,2.0,8/19/2017,"We've been to many cheesecake factory locations and this one was a disappointment. Our dinner started off good the atmosphere was pleasant with it being not very busy or crowded. Our waitress and hostess were very nice. Our displeaaure started when our food took too long to come out and when it did my pasta dish was over cooked. Not just slightly over cooked but it was mushy and had hardened into a lump on the center of my plate. I hate to send food back and avoid it at all costs but I had to send it back there was no way i could eat it. Well after already waiting a while for our original order and now needing to wait for our replacement we ended up sharing the one dish that was okay and bagged the reorder. It was such a disappointment that our inconvenience was not addressed and after ordering $80.00 worth of food for two that something would have been said, even just an apology.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=160

As I walked in, I discreetly told the hostess if they can bring out something for my kid as a surprise at the end and she wrote my kid's name on a piece of paper. Well, towards the end of our meal, the server came to tell us that a free birthday dessert is only a small scoop of ice cream and that if we want a slice of cheesecake, we need to order one. Also, she asked what my kid's name is and he is sitting right there! Ugh, so there goes our surprise. We ended up ordering a slice, and when the server brought it to our table, she and 3 other servers sang the most pathetic birthday song ever, as if they really hated what they are going through that moment. It was so sad and disappointing. Their menu is still extensive but the prices were a lot higher than what I remembered. The food was mediocre compared to their prices.

John G.,"Burbank, CA",0,121,13,2.0,7/24/2017,"Brought the family here for lunch, it was my first time eating at a Cheesecake Factory. It's a very nice establishment, and the menu is very vast with lots of options. Portions are large and prices seem about right for it. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and it seemed like a nice experience. My only issue was with my food, I ordered the lunch special shepherds pie. It's had good taste but it was floating in a sea of grease and oil. I spooned some out but it was just too much. The ground meat they used had some raw chunks still in it. Not a little pink inside, but raw, cold and uncooked pieces. And lastly it was filled with mushrooms. I understand it's mushroom gravy, but I picked out about 18 oil slathered mushrooms. Menu didn't say it was a mushroom pie. First shepherds pie I've seen with sliced mushrooms in it. I could deal with removing some mushrooms and a chunk of raw hamburger but with the grease, it was not appetizing. The nice waiter took it away and was going to remove it. We ordered some awesome cheesecake, the key lime and snickers. The waiter said he was going to try to comp a cheesecake, which was nice but I really didn't care if he could. But when the bill came he said the manager wouldn't take anything off... including the horrible Shepard pie. I was surprised being that i only took a couple bites and the rest was scooped out on the side, but clearly was not eaten. I still tipped out the waiter more than suggested because he was very nice and attentive. But come on management... I guess the Cheesecake Factory would close if they didn't get their 14 bucks for the bowl of greasy mushrooms and raw meat. I didn't even mind that my food wasn't good. Because everyone else seemed happy, it was a decent experience and new and I ate some of the lady's salad and the cheesecake was great,, but to not remove a meal that was clearly poorly made and not eaten is pretty sad.  It's a good enough reason to not return or suggest to other folks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=160
Ernest S.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",0,34,,5.0,12/1/2016,"First, for those who put 2 or 3 stars and mentioned they went during opening day or week, that's your fault. This is definitely a 5-star place. We purposely waited a month to come just to let the popularity die down a bit. Remember, SCV residents have been asking for this place for many, many years.  We went at 6 pm on a Thursday. (See, we didn't go at 12:00 pm on a weekday or 7:00 pm on a Friday night or 1:00 pm on a Sunday; avoid the stress of waiting for a table and come during ""off"" hours). Our wait for a booth was 5 minutes. Server's name was Deriana. Do yourself a favor and ask for her table. Great personality, food arrived within 10 minutes, she kept our drinks full, and checked on us throughout the evening.

Dinner was good and service was very attentive with maybe a bit too much of the friendly banter, but I cannot hold that against them I guess.

Alice A.,"Granada Hills, CA",539,143,31,3.0,11/12/2016,"My boyfriend and I were excited to check out the new Cheesecake Factory in this area. I guess you shouldn't come in with high expectations just because it's new. Ok, so we walk in and already walking up we knew it would be a wait to be seated. The hostess gets my name and advised wait time is 30 minutes. No problem we said and proceeded to wait. 1 HOUR later still waiting and at that point I noticed my boyfriend getting bothered but I being patient said 'it hasn't been that long' he looked at me like I was crazy.  Our buzzer goes off and to the front we go. The hostess that walked us over was very friendly and sat us in a good spot in our own little booth, perfect! Our waitress comes by and introduced herself, Martha. Great! We were on a roll since the wait was ridiculous but they were making up for it.  Martha takes our drink order right away. Boyfriend gets a coke and I discovered after many years that they have Arnold Palmer which is my all time favorite tea so I ordered it. Martha brings the coke, bread and advises my Arnold Palmer is almost ready. Sounds great! We knew what we wanted to order so she takes the order down. Boyfriend gets Fettuccine Alfredo and I get my favorite Chicken and Biscuits. At that point my drink had been brought and I was stoked. My boyfriend asked me to taste his coke because he was certain it was diet and it wasn't it was just flat. Our waitress was nowhere in sight and I'm not sure if it was because I was looking around but a higher up in the waitress/waiter area came up (we assumed he was their trainer) I told him about the drink and immediately took care of it. I pointed out I was scoping out for our waitress to take care of it. He was on top of it making sure his drink was up to par. My drink was sour and no Arnold Palmer but eh I let it go at this point. Our food arrived and the gentleman that was there assisting was watching our server place the plates on our table correctly because to him presentation was important and I loved that! Our food was delicious! It was fresh and we enjoyed every bite of it.  Oh and Martha was just there when our food was taken to us and we didn't see her until it was time to pay. On the other hand the gentleman that was the head guy in my book came back with another fresh coke to make sure it was right for my boyfriend. Honestly he was really going above and beyond for us just for that drink. He kept checking in with us.  The restaurant is very lovely and I wouldn't discard the suggestion of coming back. I feel like once this whole grand opening hype is over the wait won't be that bad.  Some waitresses/waiters need more training on customer service, to be more attentive and not give you the impression that they want you out once you've paid and ate your meal.  That's how I felt with another waitress roaming around our table. She gave the vibe of 'get up! Go! You already ate, we need the table' feeling.  Hopefully this all changes and if I do go back I'll update my review. Honestly the only reason it's a 3 star and not a 1 is because of the gentleman that assisted us tonight plus the delicious food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=160

Bryant H.,"Valencia, CA",2,13,2,5.0,11/9/2016,"We went last night for the grand opening, and after arriving at 4:30pm, it took just over an hour to get a table for our party of 9. The restaurant space feels a little smaller than some other Cheesecake Factory locations but the interior design is unmistakable. It was nice to experience a brand new Cheesecake Factory with everything clean and new. I was expecting there to be a few hiccups being the first day open, but the food was spot on and our server was very courteous and responsive. The only issue I had was the speed of service, since we had to wait around 30 minutes for all of our dishes to arrive, which was difficult with a bunch of little kids. At least the tasty bread tided us over. Ordering a simple slice of cheesecake to go also took almost 10 minutes, which again could be because the team is still learning the ropes. My Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger was one of the most delicious burgers I've ever had, with just the right combination of smokiness in the bacon, crispiness in the onion strings, juiciness in the patty, and sweetness in the sauce. I've never ordered that particular item before at other Cheesecake Factory locations, so I can't tell how this dish compares. We also had the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake, which was a nice, decadent end to the meal, though next time I'd probably try something more unique, since even some fast food places now offer Oreo cheesecake. Overall, our experience was very pleasant, and I'm super excited to have such a high quality restaurant only minutes from home. We'll be back for sure, but probably only for special occasions since the prices are a bit higher than what we prefer to pay. I'm hoping this restaurant will do well here in SCV and especially help to revitalize the west side of the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=160

Most restaurants in the same price will charge you the same or even more and you don't even get half the food that Cheesecake Factory gives you.  I've been here 2 times, around 9-10pm and haven't had a problem. The food is always amazing, the servers I've had were awesome and I love the new look and decorations they gave this Cheesecake Factory compared to the other ones I've been to. Give or take my favorite Cheesecake Factory is still in Sherman Oaks, but this one is good to.  JUST BE WARNED YOU WILL BE WAITING A LONG TIME TO BE SEATED because this location is at the mall & they take no reservations. So please stop complaining!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=180
Kathy C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",52,185,401,5.0,11/9/2016,So glad to finally have a Cheesecake Factory in town! We went to the mall for lunch and were happy to see they were open. We arrived before noon and it was already very busy however we did get a nice booth next to the window right away. The service was friendly and fairly quick considering they just opened yesterday. I had my fav Vegan Cobb Salad and my hubby had the Thai Lettuce Wraps and a slice of pumpkin cheesecake.  Food and service was excellent. Of course the restaurant is brand new so the place is beautiful and clean. It is much larger than I expected with the option of a nice covered patio.  We will definitely return often.  I know it will be very busy during lunch and dinner times as all Cheesecake Factory locations are. They also blocked off a section of the parking garage for additional valet parking so just FYI.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=180

Stacia M.,"Universal City, CA",10,16,8,3.0,12/29/2016,"We had a rare kidless evening so decided to try the New Cheesecake Factory. Seems like everyone else in the SCV had the same idea!  Based on our experience at other locations, we expected a wait. We were told it would be around 40 minutes so we took our beeper and strolled across the street to Urban Home. After about 30 minutes we were paged and when we got to the restaurant we were seated on the patio.  As there were two of us we were sat at their standard two seater table top which has barely enough room to put your plates on. Was a bit uncomfortable. In addition the lighting is very dim and even with glasses, our over 50 eyes had a hard time deciphering the menu. I need to read ingredients and that was difficult.  I have a lot of food allergies, including gluten, so it was nice that there were some gluten free options, but it would be easier to have those condensed onto one page rather than having to scour the entire menu looking for the symbols.  The food was good - very consistent with the other locations. My husband had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and I had a GF goat cheese and beet with arugula salad and a GF mushroom burger with no bun. Everything came to the table correctly and our server Elise was very personable. Wait time for food to arrive seemed a little long.  I was a little disappointed that the only GF cheesecake on the menu is chock full of chocolate as I can't eat Chocolate. Would be nice to have a plain GF alternative. But that's ok.  Overall a good experience - we will be back with a group but probably not as a date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=180

We waited for almost an hour for a table and got seated at around 9;00pm. Granted it was a Tuesday evening and during graduation time but any good management would expect it to be busy during this time. We were informed that they were a bit short handed and caught off guard. It took a long time to get our food but at least the food was good. What really pissed me off was how cheap this company is. They brought out a TINY little sundae cup with a candle and we all laughed. Here we are at ""THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY"" and they can't even give you a small piece of cheesecake.

And being the cheesecake factory, of course I have something to say about the cheesecake itself. After trying a few different kinds, I would get the Kahlua Coffee or the Pumpkin cheesecake.

Debra D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,3,1,1.0,9/5/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory but there are some serious issues with this location. One thing you should be able to count on is consistency with food, but this location breaks the corporate mold. Where food is cooked fresh to order at other locations, this one seems to operate on the model: cook ahead and reheat when someone orders it. There's nothing like a pricey restaurant serving old food. I've experienced wilted, rotten lettuce to burned soup, to thick oil that has separated and floats on top of their mushroom appetizers, to just cold dishes. I've sat at a table for 45mins before the waitress realized that we were in her section. I've had to get my own beverage refills from the bar because they overload their waiters/waitress with too many tables. I have received wrong orders and waited 30 mins to receive the correct one, after friends have eaten. And finally, I've waited an hour over the hostess quote time of 45mins. That's an hour and 45 mins for a table... we eventually gave up and left. This has only been 4 separate occasions. Where I expect to receive the same blow off answer that my friends received, I think that this is a location that corporate should really look into. Look into the cooks. Look into food accuracy. Look into the hostesses. Do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=200

Sarah W.,"Canyon Country, CA",151,8,,1.0,9/5/2017,"I am super patient about my experiences with food service as I use to be a server. However, today was the last straw. When they first opened, I went with my boyfriend. After getting our waters and putting in our order, it took us an hour to get our food. They tried to right the wrong, by having my boyfriends burger comped as they said ""they lost the burger."" We let it go and moved on. We tried again and came back another day after we got off work. The host suggested for us to sit at the bar area as it was moving faster than waiting for a table. We went with her suggestion. We had to literally grab a server as they were greeting every table but ours. I was dead set on getting my food there, but my boyfriend wanted to leave when our wait time reached 30 minutes.  This brings me to today. I went to order food for pick up for me and my co-workers, trying to eliminate the horrible wait staff. Ordering the food was quick and painless. However, I went to pick up my food. I paid at the register and grabbed everything as they were very clear that I had all my items. I got back to my car, and I'm missing the cheesecake! I go back in and I get the last of my items. I return to my work and I give the food to my co-workers. Luckily, they got the right food. However, I order a lunch pizza and salad. I am so irritated at how horrible this was. The cheese pizza was half cheese and half sauce. they didn't distribute the cheese. They threw it on one side and went from there. Then, my salad was literally romaine lettuce, a pinch of cheese, and 1 crouton- No Dressing. Now, if I had the time, I would have gone back and got my order corrected. However, I am at work, and I currently cannot go back just for my lunch. I am also 8 months pregnant and super irritated that the food I ordered is no where near what I expected. Especially with the experience being there. I tried to give this place a chance as they just opened at the time.

I was prepared to have ""resting bitch face, try me if you'd like"" attitude going, but I totally didn't need it!! Haha.  Way to step it up Cheesecake!! *****4th Update!!!***** Ok so tonight, like usual I head over to cheesecake to get Sunday soup and a salad. But here's where it gets real and also amazing.... as I mentioned I come here minimum 3 times a week and always ""to go"", I also have a pretty specific order which is also the same every time, so when I get to the counter, the cutest helper actually remembered my order even though she wasn't the one I placed with over the phone - here comes the reason they got 5 stars, she knew I request not to have specific ingredients even though I failed to mention it to the guy who took my order. I was so impressed and thankful. It's things like that that make a good experience exceptional instead. I was so appreciative to her for her attentiveness that I would've bought her a drink, except she was at work and I don't want to contribute to anyone else's delinquency - mine is pricey enough hahaha  Cheesecake, all thumbs all the way up!!

It was my daughter's birthday (we where a party of 4) and she wanted to have lunch at the CF.  Well there was a taste test going on at the table next to us and they where demonstrating drinks (liquor) to the employees and a bunch of dishes that where coming to their table. In the mean time we had to wait a long time to be served..maybe the managers had the chef busy with their own orders. I know that showing the waiters what the food taste like and what's in the dishes is important but couldn't' they have done it while the restaurant was closed or towards the back of the restaurant where customers where not looking at every plate that would pass their way while waiting anxiously to be fed.  (they had about 17 employees that where in this tasting).  I thought it was tacky and the other waiters that where tending the regular customers would be so distracted by the employees having a good o time tasting the dishes and drinking the liquor.  Oh well...we are good we won't be going back. It's the cheesecake factory they only really good thing is the cheesecake.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=220

Was told the wait for a table would be an hour, then at the hour mark were told to wait another half hour. After that half hour, we were told the table we were going to sit at was being bussed, then told by the manager that we were given the wrong information and would have to wait an ADDITIONAL 30 mins. The manager, Brian, refused to work with us, and as compensation for our additional hour of waiting, we were offered complimentary bread. After voicing our displeasure, Brian became hostile and accused us of lying about what we were told, which is when we realized this was not the place for us to eat.

Cindy R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,9,,5.0,3/14/2017,"Went there with my family for an early lunch. I felt like breakfast so I ordered the huevos rancheros with eggs over medium. Our meals came out and my eggs were sunny side up and really runny. The server said ""weird I specifically wrote over-medium."" No problem, we'll remake them. My family was just about done with their meal when my meal came back out to me.. eggs sunny side up..runny.. Wow. The server apologized again and offered  to take them back but by this time my family was done with their meal so I told him to forget it I would deal with it. So I had a couple of bites around the eggs which was basically black beans and salsa and the manager (I guess) brought me 3 eggs over medium. No apologies, no nothing. So they do know what over-medium means yeah! However 3 eggs on a side plate next to runny sunny side eggs ranchero style didn't make any sense to me. So I placed my napkin over the plates and asked for the check thinking at the very least I wouldn't be charged for the huevos rancheros. I was.  I think for now, if I feel like Cheesecake Factory, which I don't very often, I'll drive to Glendale or Sherman Oaks. Five stars for improved customer service! On our last couple of visits had a great dining experience with Brandon as our server on one visit and Shannon on our last.  Both were friendly and super efficient.

J N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,30,4.0,12/18/2016,"Late review. I went here on friday at 7:30pm of course during the dinner rush. I was in no rush and expected to wait a hr til about hr and a half. There was alot of people inside and a crowd outside. The hostess advised it was a 75 min wait for 1st available seating like I said I didnt mind I knew what to expect. Well let me til you i waited bout 30 minz before my pager went off ... then 2 mins for the hostess to show us our table ... our waitress was Maddison(maddie) great waitress we really liked her. She was prompt, courteous, down to earth and still professional. We already knew what were going to get since we always went to the sherman oaks galleria CF. So we had ordered our drinks and appetizer. Since it was so busy she would come and let us know that our drinks and appetizer were on its way. She gave us more bread and refilled our drinks when she saw we were low ... now our food took a little longer to come out but we didnt mind as we had appetizers and bread to hold us over. The main reason for the 4 stars is because we were given filthy silverware the forks still had previous owners lunch or dinner on it like a salad particles... but we showed maddie she apologized and brought us new clean silverware. My recommendation is they wrap their silverware in napkins and not just have it sitting on the table uncovered. Overall my experience was great maddie also made sure we got our cheesecakes to go and packaged everything nicely so it wasnt all over.  The quality of the food was excellent as well. I recommend checking them out and getting maddie as ur waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=240

I ordered the Buffalo Wings as part of my meal.  I ate a few of the flats and they were good.  When I bit into a drum the meat near the bone was raw.  I flagged down a hostess and asked for a manager.  When our waiter came back, I showed him the raw chicken.  He apologized and offered to get a manager.   The manager showed up and when I explained the issue and showed him the raw chicken he apologized and offered to replace the dish, which I declined.   He said he would talk to the kitchen manager, took my plate and walked away.  I never saw him again.  He never came back to see if everything else was OK or to let me know the situation was handled.  He was not rude in anyway, but his lack of caring about the customer was evident. When the bill came the wings were not on it and nothing else was said or done.  It was an, ""Oh well, it happens"" type of experience.  I have had good experiences at other Cheesecake Factories in the past.  This one today left a raw taste in my mouth.  I gave Two Stars because our salads were good.  From a Care About The Customer point of view it would be zero.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=240

I keep returning thinking that this Cheesecake factory is going to get their act together since they are newly opened, but every time I invest my money and time they continue to disappoint.  Last time I took a piece of cheesecake home it looked like the last itty bitty piece that was left in the refridgerator for 3 days to soak up the fridges flavors. I was disappointed with my wimpy and dated slice and asked for another slice but was denied. The most recent visit I ordered the Ahi tartar and it came out with some mayonaise- like nasty sauce that covered everything. I was going to put it on my salad, that had so much dressing it was like soup, but the tuna was so slimy from the tuna. I was hungry, so I picked it apart and ate the pieces that weren't drenched in the sauce. I complained to the waiter, who was very nice and he tried to comp it for me but his manager denied it because I ""ate"" it..  Well, note to manger... I did not come into your very average restaurant with the intent of getting a free $7.95 appetizer.

Our server came and greeted herself bringing bread and water. Her name was Samantha and she was hands down... AMAZING. We were checked on so quickly, constantly she was refilling my water like nobody's business and knew the menu really well. She was extremely pleasing to have as our server. We enjoyed her tremendously, we even left a 50% tip because of how awesome she was.  I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, my husband ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  My husband LOVED his dish, I liked mine as well, but it wasn't spicy. It was very mild than anything. Samantha could tell I wasn't pleased and offered to go back to the cooks so I could add some more spice/flavor to my pasta. Which was so appreciated. She came back with a little side bowl of it. If the pasta was spicy from the beginning, I would have left the full 5 stars. We will be returning! And asking to sit in Samantha's section for now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=260

The food is always delicious, and I like that they have smaller lunch portions, which are great for us.  They open for lunch at 11:30, which is also good for Mom.  The place is very nicely decorated, and the ladies lounge is always clean and tidy (Mom notices).

I was told not unless it was in fact my birthday. Ordinarily I am not snooty about this type of stuff, but then it dawned on me that if I said it was my birthday I could get a treat.

My family and I give many compliments to all of you. We know a new business has a lot to deal with along with some people that don't realize the challenges that come with a heavy load of customers. Bravo to you. I cannot wait to come again, this was my very first experience at Cheesecake Factory and look forward to seeing you soon.  Everyone should understand it takes a period of time to build a perfect establishment, especially with all new employees. My experience was absolutely perfect in every way, thank you again Cheesecake Factory.   I went on 1/15/17. I bought shepherds pie. EXCELLENT!  A little wait but you know it was worth it.

First stop: we came in as they were just 20mins into opening for the day and told that there is a 40 minute wait despite the place looking half empty, so we decided to wait. A few minutes later some people came in and got seated right away. Minutes later a group of people started streaming in and they all got seated right away. I told the girl in front why we weren't seated yet and was told because we were a ""large"" party. There was only me, my husband and our 3 kids. A party of 5. I pointed out to the girl that the group she seated just minutes before consisted of 4 adults and she spoke to someone and all of a sudden we were seated. The moment we got our orders, we knew right away that the quality is bad. It looked like a take out food that they just reheated. My hubby ordered a rib eye cooked medium rare and it came out burned. I ordered the combo of steak diane and scampi with the side of mashed potatoes and my potatoes were cold like salad and the shrimp looked like cooked shrimp that was microwaved for a very long time.

Mom A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",38,184,35,2.0,12/9/2016,Food at Cheesecake Factory wasn't as tasty this time? Fries at lunch were a bit too greasy and one of the birthday singers looked liked he wasn't enthused about having to sing and be there (he even rolled his eyes up and left before she blew the single candle!) so it gave it a bad juju feeling and made the birthday girl feel bad!

Elena M.,"Valencia, CA",4,39,30,2.0,1/18/2017,"So disappointed! The two stars are because the place is lovely, and the staff was kind and sweet. Ugh...the food was not good. Ordered an Antioxidant Salad, and it was mostly tough kale, with very little of the ""goodies"" listed in the menu. A couple of teeny little pieces of avocado and even less teeny pieces of pear, with a couple of halved grapes and a few blueberries. We left most of it on the plate, which was thick, tough kale. Next came the Jamaican Chicken and Shrimp. But it came without the chicken, the shrimp was overcooked and it was a large pile of slop on the plate. We asked to have the beans on the side, but it came in one big mess, and was very unappealing. One of us liked the sauce, the other didn't. They brought the chicken separately once they realized it was missing, but the chicken was a tasteless afterthought, with no flavor whatsoever. Oh, and the wait for a seat while standing up was a real drag. There was one bench which was occupied, with a lobby full of people standing. All in all, a really sad disappointment. I thought it was because maybe they were getting the kinks out of being newly opened, but found out they've been open for 2 1/2 months already. We won't go back.

Now this is our second experience here, there are THREE of us this time but it took 25 minutes and I had to find someone to get our waiter. They claim it was a shift change and a miscommunication.

Jeff B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",8,16,5,1.0,2/10/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory seems to have been very popular since its fairly recent opening. We were put off by long wait times, until we checked midweek when it was only about 15 minutes. Still busy, a full restaurant, but no long queue. So, off to the bar while we waited for our table. The one bartender was rushed off her feet, so it took a while to grab a drink. Why only one bartender? Now there's a question. Our table was in a chilly location. You really shouldn't need to wear a jacket in So. Cal, but it's yet another place with crazy air conditioning. Looking through the extensive menu, we notice that there's no nutritional info except for some ""lite"" menu items. Listing calorie counts and other nutritional info is the law in CA for restaurants with 20 or more locations, so where is this information? A helpful waiter explained that there are some vegetarian entrees, and some pasta dishes can be made vegetarian. So, I order a veggie burger, my partner orders a veggie pasta dish.  Warm bread is supposed to be served while waiting. Cold bread arrives. We ask for it to be warmed up, ""no problem"". 15 minutes and multiple requests later, it still hasn't arrived. We wait. And wait. Eventually, my partner's pasta dish arrives. Apparently mine was taken by some other server, so they need to start a replacement from scratch. So, I still wait. My partner tries some pasta. Not too bad, but.... what's this? Bits of something we don't recognize at first, then realize they've put BACON bits in a VEGETARIAN pasta dish!!! Major league screw up. We decide to leave, enough is enough. The manager apologizes and offers us cheesecake to go, which is a nice gesture. I almost bumped this rating up to 2 stars because of that, but the cheesecake was way too rich and had a ""soggy bottom"", so was really not worth eating.

Once the drinks were brought out, which took 35 mons to get, the order was completely wrong. Coffees were so cold and she had to be asked for sugar a few times.

But, regardless of that fact, their quality and service should be 110% not 5%.  I had a party of 3, ordered our favorite:calamari, cesar salas, and pasta. Prior to the order, the server brought bread and it was old. We asked for fresh bread and it took her time to bring it. We ordered ice tea and that too took some time to get to our table. I want to point out that we went on Sunday where the place was fairly empty. We got calamari and it was over fried. When we received the salad the crutons were old, and the dressing was ranch. I asked twice for the server to bring their signature dressing and twice she brought ranch. The server kept telling me that it is their cesar dressing, except it was white and tasted like ranch.

If you are here for cheesecake it will take you a while to read the whole selection!

The food quality and service have been a disappointment! On several occasions my food was missing an ingredient that I liked  also a couple of times the food was super salty. I did address the problem to my waitress but she did nothing about it!! I also waited for over to get a beverage refill. Most likely I wont be visiting this Location anymore. I might have to drive a longer distance but I will be satisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=280
Jonathan C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/2/2017,Service was good brittany was really nice did a great job. Service is not my issue the food is my issue. I got a bacon bacon cheeseburger and not long after eating said cheeseburger did i start getting stomach cramps and feel ill. The appetizzer i got the chicken slidders were awesome. Qhen it came to the burger however i couldnt eat more then half it started to taste off the more i ate. Well this being my first time there that isnt really a good start to me. I hope they can change that in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=320
S. A.,"Northridge, CA",0,30,7,3.0,3/7/2017,"Food was good. Service was very slow and lacking in general. Was almost 10 minutes after we were seated before any one came to take our drink order. Took a long time to get our appetizer. Meal came out shortly after and was good. But they forgot our side of ranch and I wasn't asked what kind of cheese I wanted on my sandwich (the menu says your choice of cheese), so it ended up coming out with Swiss on it. Yuck.. Also left off pickles on the burger yet it came with tomato after asking for no tomato... we asked for the bill to be split down the middle and they charged $36 to one card and $11 to the other.... the waiter asked if we wanted her to get the manager to fix it but we just wanted out by then.

Never once did she look up and acknowledge us or say hello or welcome. A party of 2 walked in after us about 2 minutes after we did and she popped her head up welcomed them and took them right back to be seated STILL without acknowledgment. Then our server was super than ever and never came back to refill bread since we only received two baskets of half slices to feed 8 people. Our appetizers were up before we even got our drinks after being sat for 30 minutes to look and see our server standing there talking.

Rebekah R.,"West Hills, CA",48,82,22,4.0,5/30/2017,"My family went here on Memorial Day after we went to Red Robin . Red Robin left us sitting in waiting area and just ignored us. Worst customer service I have experienced there but we left and came to Cheesecake Factory since we have not been to this new location yet. We got seated right away which was very nice. Hostess and waitress was very nice. Food was good.... the food at Cheesecake Factory I have always thought was not spectacular but it is also far from being bad. I got the bang bang chicken and shrimp. It had a pretty good flavor and a few shrimp. I was surprised on the lack of chicken though especially since the chicken is cheaper then shrimp. There wasn't such a huge lack of meat so I didn't say anything. It came with a LOT of rice though, could have toned down a little there. What's the most disappointing thing is that you guys put the calories right next to everything. Even the cheesecakes and my favorite Cheesecake is the red velvet. I knew it wasn't a diet food but 1590 calories!!! Seeing those calorie numbers right next to the names definitely changed my mind about eating dessert again. lol  I know you have to provide that info but maybe do it on a separate paper. Just a suggestion. So it's a good and bad thing, good because I watched more what I was eating but bad because it really took all the fun out of eating a slice of your delicious cheesecake. Overall I was happy with this customer service over the pervious restaurant we were just at. Spent more money then we would have at other place.... but who leaves customers waiting with a 2 yr old?   They sat everyone else but us , even people of the same party size that came after us. Shame on you Red Robin but good for you Cheesecake Factory. You know how to treat your customers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=320
Yessy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/23/2016,"I had high expectations for the Cheesecake Factory. It's one of my favorite places and I figured since it was new, they would have excellent service. I was so WRONG! First time I went, we were there about 3 and a half hours if not more, an hour waiting to be seated and the rest pretty much waiting for a waiter to come. At first it didn't take long to get someone to get our drinks and then our order but once we were done, we wanted to order dessert but our waiter was nowhere to be seen. Yet there were 3 waiters in front of our table just talking and laughing while we were trying to get the attention of at least one. I didn't think much of it though since the food was delicious and we had great company among friends.  It was the second experience that really bothered me. We had gotten lunch at the office and when they brought our food, my order was wrong. I had specifically asked for a pasta with no mushrooms, which they repeated when placing the order over the phone, yet my pasta was full of mushrooms. Second, we were missing a Cheesecake, mine specifically. So I called the restaurant, I spoke to two people before being transferred to a male manager who seriously had no intention of helping. I told him we were missing a cheesecake and he asked whose name the order was under and what had been ordered other than cheesecake. I gave him the info but he insisted that all three cheesecakes we ordered had been bagged and that the order didn't even have the cheesecake I had requested. I assured him we were missing the cheesecake but he insisted in basically calling me a liar as I'm telling him only two were in our bags. Then he placed me on hold and said he'd see what he could do about reimbursing one cheesecake to the credit card but all I wanted was my cheesecake. Then the call was gone. I called again. Asked to speak to a manager and Nicole was able to help and said I could pick up the slice I missed, something the other guy couldn't help me with. He obviously did not have any intention of pleasing a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=320
Lindsey G.,"Valencia, CA",0,15,1,1.0,6/5/2017,"Food is good, that's the only reason for one star. But service is horrendous. Besides the fact of long wait times, at the mall in Valencia on a weekend that's to be expected, the service truly sucks. Waited 30 minutes for our table which wasn't bad at all and wasn't even bothered by it, ordered our food as a party of four and my husbands food came first after about a 35 minute wait from ordering. My toddlers food, myself and father in law's came out 30 minutes after my husbands- so he was already finished and we are still waiting to eat, the waitress was sweet but continuously forgot to bring things or even come by for refills, we asked her to box the rest of the food we were waiting on to go since it was so late at this point and she forgot to do that as well. Didn't even send a manager over to speak with - which I would imagine management is just as bad as the service being that multiple reviews have said this. I was so excited for a great restaurant to open in our town but sadly after two experiences like this at this location I will not return. And the fact that they still don't accept reservations is ridiculous to me! Unfortunately, they will never last here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=320

Laurel T.,"Lancaster, CA",11,7,,2.0,8/5/2017,"Tipsy Diner at the Cheesecake Factory My first experience with this Cheesecake Factory at this location!! Normally I love Cheesecake Factory, and expect nothing but the best as I usually do from this chain. First off... the bar is very accommodating as well as the reservation desk. All started off very lovely until we were seated.  Christine S seated us... thus leading us into this journey of lies, deception, and turmoil! Christine appeared nervous... forgot the bread... took off with the drink cups and failed to routinely appear as any skilled waiter/waitress would. Naturally we theorized she was new considering the faux pas we encountered. It was at the point after grief of no bread and thirsting for a lengthy period that we decided to journey into more favorable locations. Sisely's across the street caught our eye where we then decided to depart on our journey next door. As we prepped to depart (grab my purse and stand up without staggering) the server appeared with food. I was feeling a tad sassy and was ready to take off until we looked at the food where the server was able to coax us off the ledge with a sweet card for Cheesecake! We sat down and were impressed with this servers skills.... we felt truly special with said server. Like we mattered at this Cheesecake Factory, and our happiness truly mattered.  During our service we rarely seen Christine S. and she was brief without really caring as we had seen with other wait staff, including the guy that lied about the card. Oh, the card you ask? Yes the server we were impressed with coaxed us back to the CF by stating he had a card for our distress for free Cheesecake but wasn't completely up front that all customers were receiving this same card.   At the end of our meal we went to get the cheesecake from the front desk fully expecting to use the card. As we get to the order desk, the young waitress then advised us it could be only used on certain days. My fiancée who had taken me out for my birthday dinner was perturbed and requested the manager. Sarah the Manager arrives not looking impressed, and not in the mood to deal! O get busy night but isn't this why you are here?... to ensure all runs smoothly? We told Sarah the Manager what happened with our table and the table next to ours who were also dissatisfied with poor service just as we were. She then proceeded to lie saying they didn't have a problem. I know it was a lie as I watched and heard the table as it was in my line of sight. Unfortunately nothing came from our requests and explanation of our dissatisfaction. This ultimately left us with a bad taste overall for this establishment. I mean it's a piece of cheesecake Sarah! Make your customers happy!  End result? Don't go to Christine S, the Manager Sarah doesn't truly care about her customers much less making them repeat customers. We won't be going back after this service sad to say. I understand you have the monopoly in this location so maybe that is why you don't care. Either way this lets others know I care about their enjoyment and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=320

Ross B.,"Canyon Country, CA",2,3,,2.0,1/14/2017,"Wow, I have loved the Cheesecake Factory and a little over two weeks ago had an enjoyable experience at the location in Santa Monica. Then last night happened in Santa Clarita.  First of all we had asked for a table for 5, we ended up getting squished into a booth that really is for four people with a chair added on the end, the result was a cramped dining experience. Next up was the attempt to read the menu, needed to use my cell phone light to do so. I did not have that problem in Santa Monica, I get that they have an intended ambiance but it is too dark. Next I tried to order a drink with Roses Lime in it, I have been going to the Cheesecake Factory for 20 years and this is the first and only location that has no Roses Lime juice. I then ordered a Diet Coke at the same time that my son ordered a Root Beer, the server bought back the root beer and I asked where the Diet Coke was, he said the bar is very busy and rushed off, he then returned about 5 minutes later with a Rum and Diet Coke, not what I had ordered.  Time for the Santa Clarita location to get its act together...oh and by the way, time for the chain to change up their mashed potatoes, the chunky and cold mashed potatoes they serve are horrible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=320

The host and waiter were great. I've never had a host be as helpful as this one was. The food was awesome and the outside patio was really nice. The only reason I cant give 5 stars is because there was a group of employees sitting near me (off the clock) and they were talking about customers they hate and co workers that annoy them.

Laurie H.,"Canyon Country, CA",48,5,2,1.0,4/20/2017,"Very, very disappointed! We went last night for our 13 year anniversary. The wait time was not long at all and we were seated at a small booth by some windows. The waitress was extremely nice. We placed our order and while we were waiting, little gnats were flying all around us, on the table and on the window. We both kept having to kill them with our drink napkins. The next time the waitress came by, we told her about the gnats and she said the people in the booth behind us had just complained about the same thing. She went to get the manager and when she arrived she said that we would be moved to a different booth. The manager also said that she was aware of the problem and they have had their pest control company coming every day. While we were waiting to be moved, we continued killing the gnats and one actually ended up in my coffee. There was another guy, who must have worked there because he was using the flashlight on his phone to try and see where the bugs were getting in. By this time, we were both itching and kind of grossed out. They moved all of the people, in the three or four booths that were effected, and said they weren't seating anyone else in that area. Once we were moved, we only saw about one more gnat flying around. We finally received our food and it was cold. While we were waiting to tell the waitress, the gnat landed right in the mashed potatoes! By this time, another waiter came over and asked if we wanted them to re-make our food or package the meals ""to go"". Very strange. We asked them to re-make our meals and as we waited, the waitress brought us both bowls of soup to eat. Once we received our hot meals, the food was very good. We both saved room and shared a piece of cheesecake for dessert. We weren't really impressed with the cheesecake. Once we were done, the waitress said that she was going to take our bill to the manager as she wanted to do something for us for all of the problems. When we got it back, they covered our dessert and took 25% off the rest of our bill. Whenever a problem has ever happened anywhere else, they have usually been very apologetic and taken care of the whole bill. The manager here never apologized or even came by again after she moved us. She really didn't seem to care much at all. Additionally, as we got up to leave, we noticed that they had seated more people in the same booths that had all the bugs!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=340

Our server took our drink orders, and then later came back for our food hours. It took approximately 30 minutes to produce 2 glasses of wine, and a further 50 minutes to produce our entrees. After we had waited 40 minutes, our server came to explain to us that there had been a mix up with the kitchens, but failed to do anything to compensate us, such as bring us a second bread basket or offer a complementary glass of wine. It was extremely obvious that he hadn't put in our orders with the kitchen, which is fine, but just say that. Don't tell me that some other server took our dishes by mistake, because if that were true the manager would have come to speak with us and make sure we were comfortable.  The food was fine. Not great, but fine. After spending nearly 2 and a half hours at the restaurant, by the time the food arrived I just wanted to go home.  We were extremely disappointed in our visit. It was a complete waste of a gift card. Even with the gift card we paid over $80 on the tab for a very sub-par meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=340

Amanda S.,"Dublin, CA",209,8,,1.0,1/29/2017,"Just left this place for the second time. It's absolutely, hands down the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. The service is slow and lacks hospitality. Management isn't much better. We waited over 45 minutes for our food and there seemed to be confusion among the waiters and runners over what our table ordered and if our food had come out or not. In addition, the tuna carpaccio (which I have ordered 5,000 times from higher quality cheesecake factories) was clearly old and chewy. We explained our grievances to the manager and he was nice enough to comp the bill 25% but when we received the bill they had charged us for items we didn't order. My family and I will not be coming back. I hope this location gets it act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=360
Chris E.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/2/2017,"I wish I would have listened to the reviews. Awful service, save your time and money. I took my family on Thursday June 1st, arrived at 745, wait time was reasonable and accurate. 20 min wait to be seated. No Problem, once seated we were greeted by our waitress, She was nice but clearly in way over her head. we heard the table behind us complaining and asking to speak to a manager, I thought uh oh not gonna be our night, Our server Taylor then left the area for several minutes, clearly looking to avoid the table behind us. After they left she finally came to our table, took drink and appetizer order. Both came in a timely manor. However when we placed our dinner orders, classic burger, popcorn shrimp and w kids meals, spaghetti and meatballs and a chicken tender order it all went to hell. my burger arrived first. 11 min after ordering, then a few minutes later the shrimp. No kids meals, we waited, and waited, and looked for Taylor, no where to be found, another table was also clearly distraught and seeking assistants. 22 min later she returned to ask how dinner was, I said not good as our children's food is still not here, She said oh no, I thought you just ate it fast. I said if it is not cooked then just please remove from my check. another 11 min pass, the food comes put, mind you 33 min since my burger was placed on table, I told her this was unacceptable, She apologized and hurried away. my kids began to finally eat, the food was COLD, are you kidding me? again we looked for our server and began asking for a manager, another waitress said she would send a manager our way. Never happened. Taylor came by again and dropped the check and left. I was charged the fill amount with nothing taken off, when I questioned this she said she couldn't remove as the food had been eaten. Really 2 bites on one Cold chicken tender. Unreal, She then again disappeared, I considered walking out and not paying a dime, but did not. paid the $67.00 Bill, and left. won't ever return. Just an awful experience. Either the servers need more training or the managers need more help, but at this rate it won't stay open long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=360

I celebrate my Anniversary with my wife at the Sherman Oaks Location. So I was very disappointed when I went to the Valencia location. The front desk was not friendly with me and sent me to a table for two, when it's obvious that 2 adults and a baby in a stroller would not physically fit. When I asked for another table, I was given an attitude. Then they end up sending me to another table for two (but at least this one was in the corner. The waitress was nice, but then my problem was with the food. I asked for the steak medallions to be medium rare. They brought it rare and not enough sauce. I mentioned it to the waitress and she took it back to the kitchen. When the waitress brought the plate back, it had less meat. I was very disappointed, because this was a late Mother's Day dinner, and the restaurant did not meet my expectations to what I am used to at Sherman Oaks. The obvious thing is to keep complaining and talk to a manager. I had already talked to three different employees.Had I talked to a manager, that would been the fourth person I would be talked to.  I would've ruined the night, as this was a late Mother's Day dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=360

She knew exactly when to check on us, was very timely with drink refills and removing dirty/empty plates from the table. She was incredibly attentive without being hovering or annoying. Our food was outstanding and my daughter especially loved the caramelized onion soup. My husband was raving over his chicken and biscuits.

Daelin H.,"Canyon Country, CA",78,5,,2.0,12/28/2016,"I dined at this new Cheesecake Factory location about a month ago, closer to when it first opened up. The service was super slow; I've definitely experienced better. But I tried to be patient and understanding, as I realize this restaurant is fairly new and there are a handful of new waitresses/ waiters getting used to their new job (not to mention it was during the dinner rush and it was crazy busy). So I decided to give it another try and went last night in hopes that the service would have improved, as they've been open for a little bit of time now. I was so wrong. The service was even worse. We sat down and waited over 10 minutes for our waitress to even come by and even acknowledge us to take our drink order. My boyfriend and I were awkwardly looking around to try and catch an eye of one of the employees to try and hint that we had not been helped yet. Our waitress finally came and took our drink order, and about 15 minutes later, she comes by and tells us she forgot what we ordered to drink, and asked us to repeat our order! By the time our drinks actually came we had been sitting there for over 30 minutes. I understand that it was super busy and crowded, and I'm sure she was working a lot of tables, but not once did she even acknowledge or apologize for the ridiculously long wait for our drinks, or just the slow and poor service in general. My boyfriend and I sat down at around 7pm and did not leave until around 8:45pm. We had plans to see a movie at 8:25 thinking we would have more than enough time to eat and catch a movie that within walking distance of the restaurant, but we missed our movie because we were stuck there for so long due to the poor service.

From the wait which was a little near an hour, to the lackluster service our waitress gave us and then the killer HORRIBLE ENTREE. I decided to go for the Chicken Madeira/ Steak Diane combo with the steak well done. After my corn cakes to start my food arrived and the portion was not what I feel I've received at other locations but that wasn't the problem it was the rare steak I was served. After notifying the waitress she took the plate then returned with a small plate on which she had transferred my mashed potatoes and chicken then informed me that they were making my steak....I did mention this was a combo....right. The redeeming value was the manager who came table looked strangely at the small plate of food and comp'd my entree and had them remake the entire order. My biggest problem was the food and the lack of enthusiasm and knowledge shown by the service staff.

I was instructed by 2 staff members where the to go line was then a third told me and other people we were in the wrong end. That's total BS. When I told him I was told to stand here he just said ""sorry but line starts over there"" I will never ever go there again. I'd rather drive to the Glendale location.

Never once saying thanks for holding were really busy or sorry for the long wait. Placed my order and was never thanked by this person. She literally just hung up. Disappointed by this lack of customer service I did not even pick up the order. I'm in the service business and expect more. Bad customer service.

Cheesecake's standard cashew chicken had a black, over cooked sauce. We still were patient and had no complaints as they were all so busy. Then, we get the waitress to pay our bill and have now been there for 2 and a half hours now. She comes back and says the AE didn't go through so we gave her another card.

Once at 4pm and once at 11:45.  I was very disappointed in the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. Nothing Bang Bang about it.  Luke warm and I think the shrimp should have been cooked a bit more. Seemed off.  Measly portion of rice spread thinly across the oval plate to look as if the plate was full. Would never order it again.  Service was acceptable. Waiter very nice.  Another visit was just appetizers. Sliders, Vietnamese spring rolls and drinks. Great service. And apps very acceptable.  Last visit took my family for my birthday in February.  Around  5ish. Server was just ok. She wasn't as friendly as my last 2 waiters. Food was ok. Nothing out of the ballpark. I think instead of such a large menu you could minimize it and make the dishes you offer spectacular.  Fresh and hot when served.  Cheesecake by far is the best thing about the night. We ordered one Salted Carmel and one Hershey's to split amongst the 5 of us.  And as seen in other reviews my dessert (would expect one at least) to have been complementary. After spending couple hundred dollars.  (Apps, drinks (bar) and sodas, 5 entrees n dessert.   Ya would think they would want you to patronize their business for birthdays at least they could comp a dessert for the guest of honor.  Asking too much?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=400

No apology.  Sons bacon still not out.  Couldn't get syrup for the French toast which was now cold.  Other sons pancakes were cold.  My omelette was rubbery and greasy.  The waiter admitted the runners were not bringing out the food fast enough.  When finished my favorite was the busser.  He collected one plate at a time. Plates were stacked all over and he came by twice and collected one plate at a time.  Lol.  After an hour and a half we ordered 3 cheese cakes during their half off sale. So the manager took off two of the three half off cheese cakes.  I had to laugh.  They took off two cheese cakes that were already half off.  The party next to us, ordered, ate, ordered cheese cake ate it, paid and left before we got our food.

Kristi R.,"SYLMAR, CA",46,14,,2.0,1/22/2017,"Let me start by saying that I wanted to rate this 1 star but some servers and staff were so friendly, I just couldn't do it. That being said, I would have to say this is one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. We called to see if we could make reservations being that we were a group of 24. They explained it wasn't possible and what we had to put our name 2 hours before, so we did. After waiting over 2 hours we ask for an update and the person seating at the front was rude to every one in my party that asked her. Then come to find out they had our table but she sat a party of 2 at the end of it so we had to wait till they were done. Um... Excuse me you sat a party of 2 at a table set up for 24? And then told is it would be another hour and a half (we put our name in at 5:30, got there at 7, it was now 8:40). We got a manager involved and they asked the ladies to relocate and we were finally able to be seated. They get our drinks and take our orders and food took a while to come out but it looked like a busy night so that was to be expected. Then the power goes out, so no drinks, no water to wash your hands in the restroom, and no heaters (we were seated on the patio). You could tell they were scrambling to figure it out. One odd thing is one waitress would tell us they couldn't do any drinks and then another would come out, say yes and bring them to us. We didn't get why that happened. It also started getting super cold. Luckily we had already gotten food but who wants to eat in the dark? So we're all sitting there with jackets and the flashlights on our cell phones. Then we talk to the manager and happen to have electricians in our party so they go in and fix the issue, lights come up and YEA! We saved the day. They compensated ""us"" by taking their meals off the bill but at the same time, the rest of us had to sit in the cold for I believe it was over half an hour and weren't offered anything. I even asked the server, is there going to be anything done since we've all sat in the dark for this long and they said yea that we'd just have to see what the manager said. We figured at least a free piece of cheesecake or something but nope. They said they would take off 10 line items as a thank you for ""saving the night"" which covered the checks of the few who helped out with the power situation. The rest of us paid full price and nothing was done for the inconvenience. Then, we figuring out the check took FOREVER!! I would have been better for them to set up who was going on which check when they were taking orders but they waited till people were leaving and then printed out copies and people had to circle what was theirs. I think figuring out the check took about 30-40 minutes. From beginning to end, there was issue after issue and to at the end to still pay full price for an experience like this? I would honestly not recommend this place to anyone which is unfortunate because this location would have been more convenient than going to the one in the Sherman Oaks Galleria but I'd rather make the trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=400

Lana S.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,23,5,2.0,12/1/2016,"Went here last night around 8:30 pm for a late dinner and dessert. There were 6 of us and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table (it was kindof crowded). The first thing I noticed is that there were a LOT of workers - waitresses/waiters/busboys/bartenders, so I thought ""Great, we'll get good service."" WRONG Our first waitress couldn't seem to mentally process our orders and repeated them back incorrectly (we corrected her, of course). We had to wait 10 minutes for water and then another 10 minutes for linen napkins (when she brought them, she only gave us 5 - when we grabbed a busboy and told him we needed another, he gave us a paper cocktail napkin [really?] so we corrected him as well).  We watched about 10 workers hanging out by the order computer chatting and goofing off. While we...waited 20 minutes for our drinks; received an apology from our ""new"" waitress (they apparently changed shifts at 9:30). Drinks were good. Fried mushroom/zucchini appetizer was super salty - couldn't taste the veggies at all. Although portions of the meals were very large, they were not very tasty (this included a salad, steak [which was mostly mashed potatoes instead of steak], and club sandwich). A flatbread pizza was tiny and looked like it was cooked on saltines. So then we thought, well, at LEAST the cheesecake will be good.... WRONG. Tiny portion of cheesecake with about 1-2 cups of whipped cream. For the price, not worth it. I can't recommend this place, which is a disappointment.

Jose G.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/26/2016,Wait really sucked. No common sense as to what to do when a table takes too long to leave. If you have a big party. Forget it. Because they will forget you. Never coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=440
Teresa C.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Since this place is always pack, we decided to celebrate Father's day early and yesterday was the first time we visited this branch for Father's Day celebration and the server named Victor B came over as our server.  Although it took him a long time to come over on our table, we did not mind since we are still going through the menu selections.  It's been a long time my family had been to cheesecake factory, not familiar with the menus.  When time to order we realized that the Fetuccine Alfredo on the lunch menu does not come with Chicken so we are deliberating whether to order the full menu or lunch menu considering $3 to add chicken.  To our surprice, Victor said that if we are not ready yet he has a lot of other work to do and left.  SO INCREDIBLY RUDE!!! For a high priced and well respected food chain, we expected better service and attitude.  It's not as if we took a very long time but probably less than five minutes to discuss considering how expensive the menu selections.  All of my family members heard him said this, first time they heard someone verbally and loudly commented having a lot of work and cannot wait for us to place the order. After that statement my kids did not want to ask for anything else, afraid he will make more rude comments.  The food is ok but lost the appetite for this place. I was having second thoughts to give him a tip but realized tip is shared with other staff who probably  needed it more, gave him even more than 15% tip.  I hope the company reiterates the importance of good customer service with their staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=440
Liv E.,"Castaic, CA",0,21,,2.0,4/30/2017,"Every time I leave Cheesecake Factory I wonder why I continue to bother. It was my first time at this location but my experience were the exact same as all the other times I've been to a Cheesecake Factory; crowded, long wait (on table, on getting your orders taken, on food, on more bread, water etc.), bland food, questionable service and a lot of noise. I was with a company of 7. We all waited a while for our food and when it finally came, 1 order had been forgotten/lost in translation(?). The waiter apologized and tried to explain that it was some other waiters fault. Unfortunately the order forgotten was to our 94 y/o grandfather. As for the food, it was bland at best and it seemed like the rest of my party came to the same conclusion. Our waiter was nice enough however very busy and therefore a little forgetful/neglectful. The only reason why this review gets 2 stars is because management were nice enough to give us a discount b/c of the ""forgotten dish"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=440
Cheyenne S.,"Lancaster, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/29/2016,Had the best experience! Everyone was so friendly.

G L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,88,13,3.0,4/18/2017,"It has been a log time and looking forward to trying cheesecake factory.  It will be even longer till next time. Given 3 separate menu's for dinner seemed 2 to many. Yep, was tired of seeing headers of lighter, snack, small plate that . I handed back the 2 smaller menus and had to ask where are the drinks listed . Thought i would have a white wine but when the house and other wines start at 9 dollars ? I settled for a IPA  with no price mentioned . The waitress and i was referring to the novel of a menu and I  soon gave them all back and told her what i was looking for . Artichokes appetizer was not in season , but the union soup was a not listed item of the day which was good ! No wedge salad so i went for the seared tuna salad , please remember it's blackened or Cajun and the menu didn't say.I did enjoy this salad .The fried appetizer of triangle artichokes somethings were just OK, but the dipping sauce was to die for. wife ordered the chicken lettuces wrap's and she said they were good . The service was excellent ! menu's dated and too many  Oh don't forget Happy hour is at the Bar only  : (",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=440
Sarah H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,2.0,4/8/2017,"I wasn't sure if I should give 2 or 3 stars, but I decided on 2 as a comparison to other Cheesecake factories. The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants to indulge at when I feel like eating a ridiculous amount of calories. I've been eating at them since they opened and have been to restaurants in several states. This is the by far the worst one I've been to. I've been here 4 times and was disappointed with the food each time. The bread is usually always hard and seems like it's been sitting out for a long time. The pasta dishes have been watered down. My 2 year old loves pasta and meatballs and wouldn't even eat the pasta because it was so dry and this is at a place known for putting a ridiculous amount of sauce and flavor in the food. My husband's mashed potatoes were not mashed. There were two fist sized barely cooked potatoes inside the mashed potatoes. I've also noticed the dishes are smaller portion sizes than the other restaurants, but don't know If this is a new thing they are doing. My point is everything seems like half the effort was put in. I think they either have inexperienced chefs or chefs that hate their jobs. All joking aside, I really think their chefs need more training. The staff has always been great, but really sad that the food is not up to par with the other Cheesecake factories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=440
Jason M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",177,8,,2.0,11/10/2016,"I haven't had a chance to eat inside yet but my experience with the curbside take out was bad. From the time I called it took about 15 minutes for the runner to come out for my card. I waited about 30 min in total for my first attempt at picking up my order. Additionally, parking for curbside is in the Macy's parking structure and the spots are always taken. Also, when you call, get ready to scream. It's extremely loud and they can't hear you- they need to have a quiet place where their employees can take curbside orders. Long story short, my order was wrong and I didn't realize it until I got home. I called to tell them, they said it would be 30 minutes until they could have a new one for me. I was stern with them and told them I didn't want to wait a long time when I got there again. I am writing this review as I sit here. It's been at least 10 min. I get that they're new and working out kinks but somethings you just need to have worked out before you open up shop. My wife ordered out food a little before 6 and I'm about to eat my burger (8pm). I plan to dine here Saturday so I will consider changing my rating if things go well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=440
Addy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,2.0,12/28/2016,"Had dinner here yesterday for my sister's birthday with a party of 9. My sister's arrived first, gave our name and were told because we were a ""large"" party that the wait was about 45 minutes and that we would have to speak to a manager. Understandable and not a problem, they probably want to know what kind of table or what our options were. 15-20 minutes later and we have yet to speak to a manager. When we approached the host he stated that he had advised us of the 45 minute wait, which was not the issue. We were told to speak to a manager by their own staff and we were still waiting for that. Time passed slowly and we even saw a party of 6 get taken back before us which I'm slightly confused about. After we waited for an hour we were told our table was ready, lined up to get shown our table only to see the female hostess escort other people before us. After 5 minutes of her taking back other guests and slowly getting our menus ready we were finally taken back. From here the experience was much better. Our server was very kind and attentive and she made up for the wait time. Food was great, everyone enjoyed their varieties of orders. I did not finish my meal and another server offered to box it for me, which was very nice but I had a sandwich with a lot of fries leftover. I was excited to eat my leftovers for lunch today only to discover no fries, just my sandwich. Besides the unfriendly hosts, wait time, and lack of fries, I'll probably be back.

Niki T.,"Canyon Country, CA",65,16,2,3.0,11/26/2016,"We decided to go to Cheesecake Factory after making a phone call and learning the wait was 20-30 mins.  We arrived no later than 10 mins later and the wait had jumped to 1 hour & 20 minutes.  Their explaination...""oh things can change in 5 mins or less"".  We said ok and took a buzzer.  The wait was shorter than that, about 25-30 mins.  We were sat at a table hardly large enough for 1 person comfortably, let alone 2.  Okay, we will make do.  After getting water, bread and our entrees we never saw another server come our way until we stopped someone for refills on water.  The entire  staff that walked by looked at our table, saw empty water cups and saw that we stopped eating, but no one came with refills and boxes until we asked.  When I ordered dessert, I guess it was too difficult for our server to handle because it was wrong.  All the servers smiled at each other, but we noticed they didn't smile at the guests.  Even the bussers walked by without acknowledgement.  Very disappointing and it's going to be a while before I go back, that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=440
Brittney A.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/3/2017,"You know what I looooove The Cheescake Factory but the Valencia location has turned me off. I work a few buildings away from CF and was extremely happy when they started building it. I've been there 4 times already and 3 out of the 4 occasions I was disappointed. My first time being there it was a long wait to get our food and our lunch break is only 45 minutes. But I wrote that off to it being a new restaurant. Anytime a new restaurant opens in the area the wait times are extremely long but I've learned to expect it for the first couple of months as staff learn to get it together. My second and fourth visit was where my frustration lies. I understand service being slow because its new but completely ignoring your guest is not okay. We had to flag down servers to ask who was going to wait our table. We had been sitting there for over 30 minutes without any acknowledgement. Because we were engaged in conversation the wait didnt seem so bad but once we looked at the time we couldn't believe it. And this last time we sat at the bar and we were ignored once again. We arrived at 5:34pm and sat at the end of the bar. The bartender finally approached us at about 5:54pm. We were there for the last bit of happy hour drinks but we were annoyed that we didnt even get a simple ""I'll be with you in a moment"" We almost walked out to Sisley's right before we got acknowledged. Then we had to grab the bartenders attention once again to see who we could order food from. We were brought over the wrong food items twice. We could have ate really well on someone else's dime, but were not like that! Our food didnt come for another half hour. The restaurant isnt as big as other CF locations so it frustrates me even more when the wait is so long without any acknowledgement. The front host are great though! They recognize me and my friend and always say ""hey your back!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=440
Brittany D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/13/2017,"I was very disappointed with this place. I have been to a couple Cheesecake Factories prior to this experience... it took us a while to be greeted by our server and come to find out she was covering for someone on her break which would explain her negative attitude. She didn't offer us bread which is a complimentary thing. So we ordered her server suggestion appetizer and it was the ahi tar tar and it was literally hardly enough for one person to enjoy. Anyway, we order and she tells me that they're out of the chicken parm so my boyfriend picks something else. Then comes back and tells me they're out of the shrimp scampi which is what I ordered. Had we known they were out of both of what we wanted to begin with we would have gone somewhere else. However I ordered the fettuccine instead. The server wasn't aware of what they were out of which is a manager issue. So when our food comes they delivered to me a shrimp dish and called it the shrimp scampi when it clearly was not. Oh and they charge 12.50 for one cosmo. Enter at your own risk!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-valencia?start=440
