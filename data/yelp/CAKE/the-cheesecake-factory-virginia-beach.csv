Dallas E.,"Atlanta, GA",363,103,218,3.0,12/29/2016,"I came here with my mom and aunt on a Wednesday evening, to be surprised with a 50 minute wait to be seated, no big deal. Once we were finally seated, our server was very prompt and getting our drinks out to us. So, I'll cut to the chase on that major highlights of the dinner: 1. It took our food way to long to come out. For a party of 3, a nearly 45 minute wait for food is just unacceptable. Our server blamed the untimeliness on the fact of a big party being present. It's 2016, kitchens should be able to work around that.  2. My mother ordered the chicken medeira, and her food was lukewarm/cold. She had to request more asparagus as what came with her meal was simply cold. As far as taste goes, her food tasted ok. My aunt ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta, which she allowed me to sample. It lacked that flavor, and punch you'd expect to find in a jambalaya pasta.  It wasn't the worse I've ever had but it certainly could have been better. However, it was chocked full of shrimp, chicken, and sausage, and was definitely a great portion size. Lastly, I ordered the chicken teriyaki. It came with a pineapple salsa and grilled banana. My food came out excellent, a personal rating of 4 stars. The chicken was charbroiled and glazed with the teriyaki sauce and it tasted great. I was left very full and satisfied. 3. Everyone's silverware was dirty. I'm not sure if the dishwasher had took the night off, or was rushing to get silverware out. But there should never be food particles on silverware.  Overall, this was not the best dining experience I've had at Cheesecake Factory, by my personal meal did make it ok. *As a tip, this is the only Cheesecake Factory in the 757. You might want to call ahead and ask for seating times based upon your party size before coming in. It can definitely get packed in here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20
Timmy T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",272,559,,3.0,7/12/2017,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in several years (probably close to 5). Their food offerings don't appeal to me and the quality is just okay, especially for their prices. This location is a prime location right in Town Center off of Central Park ave. I would recommend parking in one of the decks and walking over.  Since I had a gift card we decided to come here. Came here in a group of four with two of our out of town friends and we wanted to go somewhere that had an extensive dessert selection; it's almost two pages and had about maybe 30-40 plus different options for cheesecakes, shakes, and a few baked goods. We came on a Sunday night around 9PM and this place was PACKED. Apparently this location is always this busy and it caught me off guard. Luckily we were able to score a table with no wait.  The lighting is very dim which I wasn't a huge fan of, especially since our table didn't have a candle either. Our waitress was absolutely fantastic; she was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable of the menu. She even (jokingly) said I could go with her into the fridge where they kept all the cheesecakes! I got some sort of mango key lime cheesecake that had a macaroon crust. It was just okay for me and a bit too sweet for my liking. One of our friends got strawberry shortcake and it was gigantic and fairly tasty.  If I didn't have a gift card our other option was to go to the Melting Pot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20

First of all, When do restaurants bring you a bowl of lettuce with a slice of tomato in it.Second, we ordered the salmon an it tasted like tuna... was gross.. thirdly, when someone orders the bang bang chicken and shrimp make sure you tell them it's really sweet. Daughter a boyfriend could not eat it.. the tea was diabetic coma.... nothing was good tonight. I told the waitress that it was my daughters birthday. She DID NOT even say a word.. had to bring manager to table about bad food coming from the kitchen.

Mia O.,"Portsmouth, VA",53,63,65,4.0,12/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is my husband and I favorite restaurant. We only eat there once or maybe twice a year. Today we celebrated 8 years of being together and decided to go for an early lunch. We find that if you go during the day you don't have to wait as long compared to going at night. Our waiter was very nice and very attentive.  My husband and I always order the same thing.  My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was layered in meat and he described it as very filling. On the other hand I ordered the steak Diane, shrimp scampi and mash potatoes. My steak was cooked to perfection. The only thing I would complain about is that my food was not as hot as I would have liked it to be. It was warm but not hot.  For dessert my husband ordered the snickers bar cheesecake. It's his absolute favorite, he said it's like diabetes in your mouth because it's so sweet.  I ventured out and ordered the New Peppermint bark cheesecake, OMG! It was so amazing. The flavors just come altogether in one bite. Overall we had such a great experience and we will definitely be back. I would of given 5 stars but let's work on serving hot food not warm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20
Vania C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",13,118,221,4.0,2/7/2017,"I discovered Cheesecake Factory about a decade or so ago when I lived in Houston, TX, and it became a regular spot for me. What a Treat!  We are so lucky to have one here. It's a major asset to the area and gives us a leg up toward Metropolitan. We dined for dinner on a Monday night 2/6/17. Ordered two appetizers. The buffalo blast which is a meal and 1/2. Shredded  buffalo chicken wrapped in a crispy breaded wanton style exterior that you can dip in their no-kidding blue cheese (chunks of blue cheese and a little sauce awesome) or buffalo sauce. Arrives piping hot, crispy. Tonight, it was overly salty. Still a winner. The second appetizer/dinner was the avocado eggrolls. Oh My. These are to die for...perfectly ripe chucks of avocado and sundried tomatoes tucked in egg rolls served with a sweet yet tangy cilantro honey dip. I can eat these until I pop. Utterly addicting. A MUST TRY if you love avocado like I do. We typically opt for appetizers and skip entrees as we needed to save room for the grande finale: cheesecake! Tiramisu and Hazelnut were our choices this evening. My husband declared he we leaving me for the hazelnut cheesecake then proceeded to have his eyes roll back into his head and said not another utterance until he had licked that plate errrrr ummmm I mean...until he gracefully finished every last bite. A good time around with good food every time. **Prices have slowly and readily crept up over the years as expected. Seems like, lately, every time I go what was once $10-$12 is now $13-$16 and most entrees even more. Going up more quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20
Jason P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",5,128,1,4.0,10/4/2017,"Better than I remember. Very diverse menu with many low calorie options. I normally hate restaurants with large menus because that's a tell-tale sign their food is frozen and it takes an hour to decide what you want to order - but, they actually did a good job this time around. All of the food served was better than average and the service was good. Is this some place I'd frequent often? Probably not because I enjoy supporting local businesses more so than large corporations, but I would go back with no hesitations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20
Wesley D.,"Norfolk, VA",43,39,20,5.0,11/18/2017,This place has never failed me yet. The portions on their food are very generous and flavored very well. I like the vast menu so you can choose something for whatever mood you are in. The only thing I didn't care too much for was the shepherds pie and that is because the amount of grease. I always look forward to visiting and eating at this establishment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20
Steffie A.,"Chesapeake, VA",146,115,259,4.0,12/20/2016,"Who doesn't love going to a restaurant where there is something for everyone? This place has such a large menu! It's unbelievable.  I pre ordered a cheesecake for my husband for his birthday. It was a size small. Worthy it serves 8 people. No longer that's totally wrong... Is more like 15! Their cheese cake is so huge even for a small. Before I picked up the cake I decided to treat myself and my son for lunch. Everyone was very helpful. They took my stroller, got me a high chair, and brought out bread and bananas for my  little one.  The restart was very clean. It was lunch time and it was very quiet at the time. Our waitress was very polite and made sure she gave me enough time to figure out what we wanted and even carried a conversation with me.  I ordered the American cheeseburger with fries. I love their burgers it was so good and juicy. The fries were hot and fresh, and I shared my meal with my baby and he loved it! Baby approved! However the prices here are very high. If they lowered the price by a couple dollars it would be perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20
Rob H.,"Norfolk, VA",102,508,296,2.0,6/22/2017,"The review is excluding all the cheesecake flavors which are decadent and ABSOLUTELY phenomenal. We had the Red Velvet, Chocolate Tuxedo and Salted Caramel.  Unfortunately, the food has much to be desired. If you are in search of a chef created meal that has layers of taste and flavor just get your cheesecake to go and dine elsewhere.  The biggest tip off should be the fact that there are literally 100 or more items in the extensive menu. There are Italian pasta dishes, Mexican inspired, Thai etc. how can any one kitchen possibly create so many dishes? By precooking items like chicken which is used in many recipes leaving the chicken dried out and flavorless. One member of our group order thin spaghetti with Mariana from the special summer menu. It was absolutely disgusting. How can one mess up spaghetti? The pasta was obviously Pre cooked and the sauce was flavorless. Everything we had was below average. However, because we waited so long and we're starving we ate it....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20
Tess Y.,"San Diego, CA",44,37,129,4.0,7/20/2017,"Their food are usually good or satisfying. The ambience is franchise fancy. You could go in casual or dress up for special occasions. But when it's for dinner esp on weekend, maybe dress a bit nicer than plain t-shirt, but overall nobody really cares.  I love the convenience of take out order cheesecake.  Their cheesecakes are unmistakably the best cheesecake I have tasted so far (I know it's franchise, to me it's still the best). Almost tried all their flavors in the menu. It's satisfying when you're craving for cheesecakes, might have to pay more but it is worth it if you are craving for sweets and already see yourself heading down the path of sweet indulgence accompanied by consuming tons of calories. In situations like this, you might as well eat the good ones as it is worth it.  Advice: Due to different flavors, If some that may be too sweet for the taste, Usually taking little bites at a time with milk helps. Never gobble a cheesecake. I used to eat the ones they sell as a platter at the grocery stores. Ever since I have been eating Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes, I don't eat the grocery ones anymore. I also tried a few bakeshop and other fancy restaurant cheesecakes so far Cheesecake factory is still the best place to go. Not that I'm being snob, but I try to choose and eat my calories wisely.  I've been to this location several times and will go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20
Belle A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",46,161,1862,4.0,3/9/2017,"This place is great for celebrating any special occasion! They can accommodate small and large groups. However, no reservations after 4pm during the week days. Great atmosphere and great for kids as well! They furnish a kids menu and it's loud, so no one is going to be staring at your kids if they get loud. Very nice atmosphere minus the noise volume at times. Overall, great for family and friends. If you want a quiet, intimate dinner, you'd be better served elsewhere at some frou frou restaurant. I love the fact that they have dishes for everyone! And best part of all, desserts galore! It's heaven on earth when it comes to their desserts!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20
Jason P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",211,99,170,4.0,4/5/2017,"This is the only Cheesecake Factory in the area I believe and it's always a little busy. We go here for birthday celebrations usually but not often. It's still a good place to eat for the most part. The menu for this place is huge! It's essentially a book. If you ever been to Cheesecake Factory, the menu varies a lot. It varies from breakfast food to pastas to steaks and seafood. I got the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken dish and it was pretty good. Compared to an actual Thai restaurant though, it's not as good. My fiancé got the skinnylicious tacos and it was good nothing special though. Inside is very pretty with an Italian theme, pretty consistent with a restaurant in Town Center.  Negative things are that a lot of things in the menu have insanely high calorie counts which may turn some people off. It might be good but it's definitely bad for your health . Some people won't care though. But would go here again only for birthdays and other celebrations though as I tend to stay away from chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=20

Interior is beautiful,  high ceilings, gorgeous columns,  lighting is a bit dim,  but sets a mood.    You start off with their complimentary bread and butter (refillable, just ask). Tried the Fried Macaroni appetizer,  that was really yummy! I had ordered the hibachi steak,  Medium, I like my meat tender and juicy. Accompanied with Mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was delicious! I recommend! My boyfriend ordered the Kobe burger with Sweet potatoe fries, yumm! My sister ordered the Chicken Madeira, that tasted real good too! Mom,  ordered the Orange chicken with white rice,  it wasn't too bad. Chicken tasted like it was battered in tempura batter than cornstarch/flour. Pops, ordered the Thai Salmon with Brown rice. That tasted very nice. Salmon was cooked on point. Dessert: ordered my Favorite: Red Velvet Cheesecake!!!

Scott D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",5,5,15,3.0,12/19/2017,"Well my wife and I love to come here and chill. Everyone knows their menu is fantastic, and we always get extra cheesecake to take home. But don't come here expecting quick or ""the best"" service when during any of their busy times.  I'm actually pretty irritated that the last two times I've wanted food from them, I've had to wait more than 10 minutes on hold to place a pick up order. I figured I'd do a small, two-item to go order, and give plenty of time before getting there. And then on top of the long hold, I still waited another 20 minutes for my meal after getting there. ...that was the last time I placed a pick up order. Today I figured I'd give it a try again, and after being on the long hold while driving from work, I'm told it'll be another 25 mins for my to go appetizer and that they don't have the avocado for it.  So today I didn't even place the order. I don't hate them or anything. I just wish they were better staffed. The food is still awesome. The service we get from the servers when we do go in is always decent/good at least. But I just don't make a habit out of this place because I don't have the time most days to wait for their overall service. My wife and I will only go in if we have a night to ourselves and a couple hours to spend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach
Melanie C.,"Norfolk, VA",206,160,366,4.0,12/15/2017,"Birthday celebration at The Cheesecake Factory was a success! I have been to this particular location on numerous occasions with no issues. The food always tastes delicious and the service is usually pretty good.  My husband and I stopped in on a Tuesday night around 6ish. It was not very busy, so we were seated immediately. If you visit this location over the weekend, plan to have a wait. It can get VERY busy Friday & Saturday night.  We were greeted by our waiter and bread was served not too long after (I love the brown bread-it's so soft & yummy). I decided to order the Chicken Taquitos (2 full size taquitos cut in half) off of their ""small plate"" menu and they were delicious! They were light & crispy.  For my entree, I ordered the Santa Fe salad. I'm not usually a huge fan of salads, but this one gets me every time! The mix of grilled chicken, black beans, and lime is a fantastic combo. The salad is very filling and I usually end up taking half of it home.  For dessert, my husband and I split the S'mores Galore cheesecake. If you are a fan of melted marshmallow and rich chocolate (like me!), then this is the choice for you!  The only issue we had during our visit was the disappearance of our waiter towards the end of the meal. We had to ask several other wait staff for boxes and refills of our drinks.

Tyler M.,"Norfolk, VA",293,182,610,4.0,12/6/2017,"WARNING: The lighting in The Cheesecake Factory does not make for good pictures, so this is more of a ""put your phone away and enjoy real conversation"" type of restaurant (something we should all do more often). My wife and I always visit The Cheesecake Factory on special occasions, and this visit was no exception. It was my wife's birthday and we were looking forward to the visit all week! We were NOT disappointed. It was a Tuesday night around 6pm, and we were immediately seated when we walked in. There's usually a long wait, so this was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the Chicken Taquitos appetizer and were not let down. From the presentation on the plate to the taste, they were a hit with us. They were crunchy, yet soft on the inside. The green sauce drizzled over the top made for a unique spin on your regular taquito. For my entrée, I ordered the Orange Chicken with Brown Rice and Mixed Vegetables. You can choose white or brown rice, and I definitely should have chosen white. The brown was a bit dry and wasn't cooked too well in my opinion. The chicken was AMAZING. The orange was not overpowering, and the white meat chicken was very tender with a light crunch on the outside. The vegetables consisted of sugar snap peas and small strings of carrot (?), which proved to be less of a side and more of a small treat. We finished up our night with the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore cheesecake to share (which we barely ate half of since we were so stuffed from our entrées). It tasted amazing! I highly recommend giving it a try. The melted marshmallow on top made it for me. Our waiter was great at first, and a bit preoccupied when we were trying to order cheesecake and ask for the check. I wish he was a bit more attentive, but it did seem like he had a lot of tables. Other than that, our experience was a great one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach

One of the things I like about The Cheesecake Factory (in addition to the yummy desserts) is that the menu offers a lot of options. I'm currently not eating any gluten, soy, dairy or sugar but I managed to find something that met my dietary restrictions. I had the super antioxidant salad with grilled chicken. This salad was full of yummy goodness- lettuce, spinach, kale, blueberries, almonds, grapes, broccoli, roasted pears. Although I didn't see many pears. The salad was delicious without any dressing. I also ordered a side of fries which I never received but totally forgot about it.  I love that this restaurant also has a skinnylicious menu which offers menu options on the lighter side.

It's a beautiful space, though it can get loud when crowded.  Warning - the menu here is HUGE. And by huge, I mean extensive. Seriously, you could spend an hour trying to decide. I wish they had more lunch size choices and more than one soup a day, though. With a menu that size, you'd think they would do more than one soup choice.  I ordered the bacon bacon burger with a side salad (blue cheese dressing, of course!).  My companions had a chicken pasta Alfredo dish, a regular burger and one of the salads (wish I could remember the name - it was beautiful!). My burger was cooked perfectly mid-rare, as ordered, as was my compainion's. I loved the two different types of bacon on top. The salad (while small - mostly just greens and a tomato) was tossed in the dressing. It was a very nice blue cheese. I would order it on the side next time. My friend with the pasta dish LOVED it, though it was huge, so guess what she took home for dinner!

Barbara W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",140,123,234,2.0,6/29/2017,"I cannot seem to win here at the Cheesecake Factory. I've been waiting to write a review because everyone I know seems to love it and I keep giving chances. Needless to say every time I have come there's an issue with the food. Issues are either overcooked, under cooked, not what I ordered and the list goes on. Last night I decided to try their Chicken Pot Pie, big mistake I should've went with my gut and order the Chicken Alfredo. Well, all that was tasted in the pot pie was something sour. I made sure to have someone taste behind me to make sure my taste buds weren't off, but seems vinegar or something else was poured graciously into the pot pie.  I will say that the appetizers I had were amazing, we had some Chicken Samosas with Cilantro dressing and it was mouth watering.

The menu is overwhelmingly expansive, but in a good way. I love that there is so many options available. The waitress recommended I try the Santa Fe salad. It was a great choice! The portion size was huge. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his steak as well. The menu price for the portion size you are getting is amazing. I thought it would be a lot more pricey. Little to no wait, great service, huge portion and food was delicious - can't wait to return and try more.

Alicia W.,"Hampton Roads, VA",402,95,231,2.0,3/19/2017,"Unfortunately, I cannot give any more than two stars even though my hopes we to go in and walk out with five. It took ten minutes after sitting down for anyone to come over and even ask us about out drink order. At this point it was also the second time asking for a high chair. About ten minutes later our drinks come yet still no high chair so we ask again. Faintly about another 10-15 minutes passed and someone brought us one. We were checked on once to see how our meals looked a couple minutes after they were all brought out and not spoken to again until we were finished and asked if we wanted to order cheesecake.  We decided on going to Cheesecake Factory for the brunch this time around. We ordered and the appetizer came very quickly. We then waited almost 45 minutes or more for our meals to come. We had two children, one of which was getting a bit restless, and when the meals came both adult meals came out 5-10 minutes sooner than the kids meals. I just think at the very least if the meals are not going to come out together bring the kids meals out first.  The chicken and waffles sounded delicious but it was lacking in all aspects. The chicken was nothing more than fried chicken strips that come pre-frozen out of a bag. I don't even think I'd order these off the kids meal for my children. The poached eggs were overcooked and the waffles were very soggy. The potatoes that came with it had no flavor. I'm very disappointed all around with both of these meals (the adults ordered).  Children's meals were fine although a little on the expensive side for a kids meal. We ordered cheesecake to go and other than the bacon and the mimosas this was more than likely the best part of the meal. Cheesecake Factory I had much higher expectations and left disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach

The waitress was super attentive and we got our drinks, bread, appetizer and main course in a short time. I appreciate the speediness of how they keep the restaurant since they get pretty busy. Per usual, I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and my tummy (and wallet) was super satisfied. The portion was so large that I ate a bit for dinner and had it for lunch and dinner the next day (STILL DELICIOUS).

It's not real close to where I live and it's not the most affordable place and, most of all, the portions are ridiculous. So I don't get there too often. Maybe once or twice a year. But when I do, baby! I roll around and immerse and myself  in the cheesecakiness of this factory. Yesterday I went for lunch with my daughter and I enjoyed their always delicious chicken salad. They add slivered almonds to it which adds a nice crunch. The fries are perfect and I always order mine with a side of their very delicious ranch sauce. My daughter had a generous side salad and a pasta dish with a pink sauce. I believe it was called four cheese pasta. D Lish! Again their portion sizes are so large that not only were we able to take leftovers home for dinner that night but there was no room left for cheesecake. That may be a fly in your business model ointment Cheesesteak Factory. I know their portions are so large that I actually brought a cooler with ice for my leftovers. We were going to the movies afterword and I didn't want to leave food in my hot car. Nor did I want to waste it. The atmosphere is wonderful! It's a beautiful restaurant. The servers are all professional and very friendly. There is lots of parking and just overall five stars. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Go! Tip...order all brown bread.

We had the edamame app and the fries mac and cheese to start. The edamame is sprinkled with sugar instead of salt. It was weird and we couldn't decide if we liked it or not. The mac and cheese balls were delish.  For the main meal I had the shrimp summer rolls and they were really good but everyone else got pasta dishes and weren't really impressed with them. The pasta was super starchy and it stuck together in big noodle globs.  The cheesecake was on point. It might be my imagination but the pieces looked bigger than usual? We ended up being there for 3 hours. Mostly because we were taking our time. Our server, Matt, was amazing and patient and got more than a 50% tip because I know how annoying it is when you have a party that lingers.  We only make it out to Cheesecake Factory once a year.

The waiter was pleasant and took our order for drinks. If you've never been to the cheesecake factory they do have free bread and butter as appetizers.  The waiter wasn't speedy but was good with expected timing due to how busy it was; there were about 6 other birthdays. I ordered the California Cheesesteak. I am not a fan of bell peppers which was listed in the description however, I am a fan of cheese steak. I will be honest and say that I wouldn't order the cheesesteak again. The portions are pretty big you are sure to be filled. I don't recommend grabbing an appetizer; you'll be filled before your entree! There's something for everyone on the menu, including vegan options. They also have an additional menu for those dieting, called the skinnylicious menu if I recall correctly. The only downfall to the restaurant would be the lighting, it's way too dark. I can't image how the employees deal with it; it could most likely ruin the older employee's/customer's eyes. The restaurant is well kept and clean. Lastly, I got a cheesecake; Lemon raspberry.

During our wait I observed a gentleman who was there with approximately five teenagers.  The gentleman asked the young lady that was taking reservations how much longer he had remaining, with an attitude she replied ""you've only been here 30 minutes your expected wait time is an hour to an hour and a half"".   After waiting approximately an hour my sister- in- law went and asked the same rude young lady how much time we had remaining, her response was ""ain't nothing changed"".   What ever happened to pleasant customer service? I told my sister-in-law to turn the pager in because her attitude was unacceptable Our party of 22 went across the street to Macaroni Grill and had a grand night When dealing with customers you should remain courteous.  Perhaps this young lady needs a position where she is not the first points of contact for customers.

She went to other tables in the vicinity and checked up on those tables multiple times but did not stop by to check on us until we were done eating--probably about 20-25 mins later.  To her credit, she was very nice and never rude, but all around that was pretty crappy service that we received.  Since my last review, I have been to Cheesecake Factory multiple times.  Unfortunately I have observed a noticeable decline in service and consistency with the entrees. Due to the lackluster menu, high price and crappy service, it will be a LONG time until we dine at the Cheesecake Factory again.  There are simply too many good restaurants out there to spend good money and not waste it on a dismal experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=40

Our drinks were always full and we felt very taken care of. We ordered an appetizer each, because their appetizers are the absolute best. My boyfriend got the macaroni and cheese balls, and I got the avocado egg rolls. So delicious! Oddly, about 10 minutes after the mac and cheese balls came out, the avocado egg rolls came out with another order of mac and cheese... apparently our apps got mixed up with the table next to ours. We got a fettuccini alfredo with shrimp to split and it was amazing! The pasta tasted SO fresh, the sauce was great, and the portion was huge, as always. I think the shrimp could have been cooked less but it was still really good. And of course, we ordered dessert, but we were so stuffed we took it to go. I chose the lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was the perfect combination of sweet and tart, and my boyfriend who isn't a cheesecake fan, ordered the chocolate cake, which had 6 layers of cake and 7 layers of the best frosting I've ever stolen a spoonful of.

If you are dining with picky eaters you can rest assure they'll find something on the menu that will suffice.  The cheesecake is pretty good but I'm upset about the discontinuation of my pineapple up- side down cheesecake. I asked what on earth would persuade them to make that decision and they (they = the person at the cheesecake counter) replied ""because it was only popular at this store, eveything is based on what's popular at the California locations"" so basically they only serve what sells in Cali..

Whether you want something kind of Asian to something steak. The staff is nice and lots of care seems to be taken to make sure the customer is happy. I hit this place up on a Sunday, last week, after a Symphonicity concert at the Sandler Center, with my Mom. We had a nice date night. I don't remember our server's name, but he had a huge section of the bar to serve and did a really nice job. He was funny and got us everything we wanted. Our only issue was getting sweet tea, instead of un-sweet. I really appreciated him being upbeat and friendly to my Mom (who is frumpy, and doesn't get out much to engage strangers). Their food can be called a little expensive, but it's really good, and you totally have two servings of food there. We were both able to take home half of the meal and save it for another. Definitely worth it, to me. I ate the orange chicken, since I don't like the snow peas medley that comes with it, the broccoli is a delicious substitute that isn't covered in the sweet glaze. The chicken was breaded a bit heavily, but tasted amazing, and there is a ton of it! My mom ordered a chicken and biscuits dish that was like a pot-less pot-pie. She loved it. I tried it... tastes like pot-pie to me, but if she liked it, that's all that matters. Dessert was some cheesecake that they showed on the big ass TV screen.

Jeff L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,55,82,1.0,6/9/2017,"One of the worst welcome/seating experiences I have had at a Virginia Beach restaurant.  Cleared the waiting area several times before seating our party and we were there well before parties of the same size.  Hostess appeared to be extremely overwhelmed.  Once we finally were seated our server was very nice, helpful and friendly.  His attentiveness was the lone bright spot of our dining experience.  Food quality was very average but pricey.  They even ran out of croutons for salads? I do not expect to return here as there are plenty of other restaurants in VB that do a better job, provide exceptional service, and are good values.

After putting in my drink order here a mere 3 minutes later my waiter asked us if we were ready to order. No sir I'm not, Im still on page 7. If you are indecisive as I am this place will rack your brain.  Now the main attraction...the basket of bread. I ask for ""the brown bread"" only and my request was granted. Its something about its flavor that soothes my soul (and stomach), its an easy tie with texas roadhouse bread if only cheesecake factory had flavored butters. For my dinner I ordered the fish tacos which came with rice and beans. The tortilla tasted like flour, the fish had no taste and the salsa and crema brought it back to life.

I mean, lemme know.  I'm not a chef, but I've never had tuna tartare prepared that way, and it wasn't terrific...until I removed the ginger.  (I asked the server, and asked him to ask the kitchen about it...Inquiring minds want to know.)

In my opinion you get more for your money here. The only downside about this place is that it can get very crowded on weekend nights.  A typical weekend night for dinner is at least a 45 minute wait. My parents and I got here around 8pm and didnt get seated until 9... then it took a while to get our meals but the toasty bread they served distracted us from how long the wait was.

I've been here plenty of times but it has been a while. My recent visit was for my Sister's 25th Birthday. I had asked her where she would like to go for her birthday and she said Cheesecake Factory as one of her choices, so my family surprised her by taking her there for dinner. Came here around 530 with 5 adults and one infant,  and they sat us right away ( no wait at all,  yay)  Our waitress was pretty attentive, she went a head and took our drink orders as we were still deciding of what to eat. As we got our drinks, we went ahead and ordered our appetizer and meals. As our appetizer we ordered their oh so delicious Fried Mac N Cheese (comes with 4 balls). Birthday Girl ordered first of course, and ordered Hibachi Steak with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes (was pretty good, but I don't like medium steaks *womp*) My dad wanted any fish dish, so he ordered the Thai Salmon with Brown rice. He said it was okay but not the best. Then my mom ordered the Orange Chicken with white rice, she wasn't that impressed either. (My sisters favorite dish, she tried it and she said it was pretty off that time). My sisters boyfriend had ordered the Kobe Burger with Sweet Potato Fries, which he killed it!! I ordered my favorite dish on the menu, the Chicken Madeira with Brown rice instead of Mashed Potatoes!! Gahhhh, the Chicken is so tender and easy to cut and eat. Oh and it comes with Asparagus and Mushrooms too, yummy. Love love this dish!! PRO: Very clean, Great Service, Delicious Food!  CON: A little wait on refills, and bad lighting in the bathroom especially the changing diaper station. Overall, this is a great place for big parties (might be a wait bc of all the orders, orders come out all at once), birthdays, prom dinners, anniversaries, graduation parties and other special occasions!

Let me tell you that Cheesecake Factory is in my top 3 for chain restaurants! The food, though a tad pricey (for dinner anyway), is always perfect! (To me it is.. Anything and everything I've ordered has never disappointed.) My favorite appetizer is the Fried Macaroni & Cheese balls- just amazing. For dinner- it is the Chicken Madeira, which similar to Chicken Marsala, and comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The cheesecakes are classic and delicious! My favorites are: Vanilla Bean with a side of strawberries, and also my new found favorite - Dulce de Leche cheesecake, OMG. The place is beautiful - I love the high ceilings and decor. The wait staff is always friendly.  One of the cons is how busy and long the wait is during the weekends. But that is to be expected and can't be controlled. I do have to warn you - a slice of cheesecake is not free for your bday! lol. I once dined here with my mom, and she told them it was my birthday, and they asked what my favorite cheese cake was, and it sure was on the bill. lol.

If you have never been to a Cheesecake Factory, you are missing out, my friend! Try it today! And if you don't want to wait, your best bet is to come on the weekdays, when it first opens (11am.)

Unfortunately with a small delay at the tunnel & a 20 min wait we weren't seated until just before 9pm. We had looked at the menu while waited so we'd be ready to order. We were greeted by a very pleasant Louis.  While waiting for drinks my husband noticed silverware on the floor under our table that hadn't been cleaned before we were seated. My water was in a plastic mug without lemon that I requested & my husbands tea was in a glass with a straw. After bringing our drinks, he brought whole grain bread & some French. It was nice & hot. My husband had Evelyn's favorite & I had steak Diane & shrimp scampi combo. His rigatoni had penne mixed in which isn't a big deal.  When a different waitress delivered his plate she said the plate was really hot.  Unfortunately mine was not and my food was lukewarm at best. The flavor was delicious though. The shrimp scampi was creamy & not oily and had full cloves of roasted garlic. The mashes potatoes weren't very mashes. Twice I got a large potato of my fork which I had to take off and cut with the side of my fork. They were good redskins but almost too buttery for my liking overpowering the yummy potato.  The steak medallions were a perfect medium.  The sauce was very rich.  Unfortunately Louis didn't check on us until we were 3/4 done with our meal and apologized when I let him know my food was cold. He was busy with a 20 top next to us.  We got our key lime cheesecake to go which I'm sure will be great.

The family was in town and they had an errand to run down at Pembroke so after we were finished at the mall we walked across the VB Blvd and had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. The place was pretty packed for a Saturday afternoon as there were a couple of party's going on. We sat next to one of them however they pretty much done and weren't noisy. There were 5 of us, 3 adults and 2 children and even though they were busy our server was still timely and attentive, checking with us regally and keeping the drinks topped off, etc. Kudo's to her. We started off lunch with an order of Tex Mex Eggrolls. Six of those came in the portion along with sides of guacamole and salsa. These were good but I've had better at other places.  I opted for a Cuban Sandwich for my lunch. My brother had a Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese and his wife had a Club Sandwhich. Let me just say the Cuban and Chicken Parmesan sandwiches were big enough to be 2 meals each. The Club sandwich was no slouch either, however it wasn't as big as the other two. This was hands down the best Cuban Sandwich I've had in recent memory. The Cuban included roasted pork, Swiss cheese, Ham, Pickles, Mustard and Mayo on a grilled and pressed Cuban style roll. The kids had kids meals which included a mini chicken sandwich with fries and a quesadilla.  Were we done yet? Sorta. I was Thanksgiving full, however my brother and his son opted to split a gigantic slice of chocolate cake. I sipped on some Cappuccino while I waited for both of them to explode. This was a super delicious lunch and I look forward to visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=120

I hate sending door back, but I asked politely, and the waitress was very friendly and nice about it. I then ordered the fried macaroni and cheese burger with fries and ranch, and it was perfection. The whole restaurant was also immaculate including the bathrooms. Overall my expierence here was awesome as well as the waitress (her name was Megan). I would definately recommend this location!

Ban Ana C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",14,20,24,3.0,9/24/2015,"Usually I would just order cheesecakes because they are really good. The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is very rich, and it's not sweet like other cheesecakes, a little bitter, which is perfect for a dark chocolate fan like me. The Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake is rich too. It has a good balance between coffee and chocolate. Those cheesecake are HUGE and rich, and it's not cheap, so I recommend you to share with someone.  This time my mom and I wanted to try their food so we ordered a Shrimp With Angel Hair and Steak Diane And Shrimp Scampi. We've waited for 15-20 minutes for the food maybe it was because the other day was a holiday so the restaurant was full of people, which I was ok with it. Also, they provided us free breads with butter while we waiting.  Anyways, the Steak Diane And Shrimp Scampi is 4/5. The steak was cooked as what we asked for (medium-ware); the shrimps are big; I assume the mashed potato is made with fresh potato since there are some skins with it; the sauce on the shrimp is creamy and it was good. Now the Shrimp With Angel Hair. It's 1/5. I have never paid $17 for such a simple dish. It's dry and no taste at all. The tomato sauce looked AND tasted like canned diced tomatoes, and it doesn't even have sauce. Even the waiter added some cheese on the top, It's still no taste. The angle hair was too dry that I have to use a knife to separate them. Also, it's warm when it came to our table, so it actually turned cold while we were eating it. Honestly I can cook something better that this crap lol. Overall, I recommend the cheesecake and the ambience of the store but not the food. You can definitely find somewhere else to have better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=120

It's great. Try any entree you want. I have enjoyed the Louisiana pasta and the Chicken Piccata. Both solid options.  Finish off with a coffee and cheesecake. My favorite all time cheesecake is the lemon meringue. Also the seasonal stuff is great. I suggest the pumpkin pecan cheesecake. It's the perfect nostalgia for thanksgiving.

First of all I have ate at about 9-11 TCF's around the USA, they are consistently good & we love the atmosphere, my bride says she feels like it is a vacation resort. Agreed! Walked in & were promptly greeted & seated, Brittany popped on the scene & was  the perfect gal for our evening, even offering some recommendations we may not have normally tried, as my son was overwhelmed with the 21 page/200 item menu. My son was torn between the 4 cheese pasta & the Hibachi Steak, So I suggested order both & we will split them. Four Cheese Pasta Penne Pasta, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano and Parmesan Cheeses, Marinara Sauce and Fresh Basil. Also served with Chicken.  Was an A+ dish & we had leftovers Hibachi Steak Certified Angus Hanger Steak with Shiitake Mushrooms, Onions, Bean Sprouts, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and Tempura Asparagus. A++  I cannot even put into words how good & tender this  was & the veggies were excellent. The Bride ordered : Chicken Madeira Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes.  The look on her face after the 1st bite was priceless, her new all time fave! We did not get any cheesecake, as we all had leftovers. I consider that great restraint!

Cheesecake Factory widely known as the distributor of cheesecakes but its also a restaurant that offers a wide and extensive diverse menu. This particular branch is busy all the time. I suggest to booked your table ahead of time. Don't assume that once you get in you'll immediately be served and seated. My favourite spot to dine in is the outside deck. Family section and bar area is available too. In recent visit, I came here for lunch with friend whom I haven't seen for such quite sometime. I didn't order appetizer because I'm saving it for the dessert so I directly ordered the main course which is herb crusted filet of salmon over mashed potato and asparagus on the side. Thought the fish was cooked to perfection. It was seasoned well and lots of flavor. The mashed potato was soft and creamy and the asparagus was exemplary delectable and crunchy just like the way I want it. As for dessert, I had the red velvet cheesecake. Oh my god, it was moist, smooth and rich.The cream cheese frosting just makes it more even delicious and elevate the texture of the flavor of the cake.

The other thing that makes this place great is the ambiance.  It's just a cool restaurant.  Like eating in a cathedral almost.  Massive chandeliers, vaulted cielings, plenty to look at.  It reminds me a little of Union Station.   Now, the drawback, non-adventorous types that are looking for a high-class, middle tier restaurant will flock to here and the PF Changs across the street.  Which is cool, I get it, but be prepared for a lengthy wait.  Well, unless you just want some cake, you can sidle up to the cake ""Bar"" as I call it and order it to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=140
Kevin J.,"Waverly, VA",17,13,28,1.0,3/23/2016,"This was my first time visiting this restaurant. I have on several occasions, visited one in NY while I was a resident. I am extremely disappointed in the service that I experienced on Thursday, March 17, 2016 at this location.  My son had just gotten married and decided to have the wedding lunch here. When we (3 in our party) entered the restaurant we were directed to our tables. Our waitress took our drink orders. Twenty minutes later the rest of the party joined us. A total of 14 to the party graced our section. Ten minutes later the waitress took their drink orders. An 1-1/2 hours has passed since entering the restaurant and my food order has not been taken. Finally, two waitresses started taking food orders. I was the first to order a Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger w/ fries (that is no typo, the name is correct). The people who came in after us, ""the first 3,"" got their orders within 20 minutes. I am still awaiting my food. Everyone was served and still no food for me. The waitress came and brought me my fries and said, ""Here are the fries, sorry for the delay, but at least you have something to eat on until your burger comes up."" A total of 2 hours 10 minutes, my burger arrives. The waitress said, ""You're a saint."" I asked the waitress for a carry-out tray to take it with me, because everyone else was just about finished with their food. I was so upset and irritated that I didn't want to eat when the food finally arrived. Mind you, the restaurant was not crowded for that time of day. I literally walked the restaurant to see just how crowded it was. The rest of the wedding party made comments about how I ordered first and got mine after theirs.

I just love their ambiance and openness of the establishment. There's never a time during the various hours I've been that there wasn't a wait or a gaggle of people waiting in the lobby for a table. Never. This time was no different. Although it was just me and my boyfriend, the host told us it was a 10 minute wait (wait, what?!) but we opted to sit at the bar where it was fairly empty with only a few other patrons enjoying the last of their brunch. Brunch is until 2 PM and it was 2:10 so sadly we just missed it!  Not to be disappointed we perused through their vast menu and decide to try a Mediterranean salad, their Hibachi steak and mashed potatoes, and their Chicken and Biscuit. My boyfriend is not a big foodie and he mainly eats to survive. Me? I eat for sport. It was my first time ever hearing him make a sound after taking his first bite. He was super impressed and dare I say it, practically in LOVE with his hibachi steak. I giggle when he let me try it. It was definitely tender but the marinate was something so similar and familiar to what we Asians use for our ""barbecue.""  I told him to enjoy it and that I will make him the same dish again soon. My chicken and biscuit was served with mashed potatoes and I was a happy bunny. It hit the spot and was so comforting. One thing I realized when we left was that I didn't have their signature Strawberry Lemonade this time.

I actually couldn't even eat more than a few bites because it was just that unappetizing to me. The broccoli was unflavorful and about the only thing I liked was the mashed potatoes which I originally planned on skipping eating because...well...carbs and me don't get along these days. I brought the chicken home for my dog. He liked it much more than I. I also ordered a piece of tiramisu cake which I did enjoy.

sherri s.,"Newtown, PA",30,261,24,5.0,3/17/2017,This Cheesecake Factory Restaurant was made extra special due to Britney and Vincent.  I was traveling to this area on business.  My Hubby was with me on this trip.  We had lunch two days in a row here as it was conveniently located near the HGI.  Britney was our server on day one and Vincent on day two.  All servers in any restaurant should be exactly like them.  Both made their jobs seem like it was effortless and still fun.  Their high energy and wanting to please rubbed off on us and we left feeling happier than when we arrived.  Then on day two we found out they are a couple...totally made our travels very special.  Thank you Britney and Vincent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=100

No appetizers , no bar tab. Just a burger, a chicken salad, and a steak dinner. The salad went back as it was brought out 15 minutes after the other two dishes were.  The manager came out to apologize once we complained to another server. But Diana P who was our server took her time with the check as well. She still got a 10% tip but it was not earned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=100
Eliana R.,"New Port Richey, FL",8,16,5,1.0,6/18/2017,If I could give this place zero stars I would. We had one person from our party arrive at 10:30am to reserve a party for 7. We arrived at 11:45am because there was over an hour wait. We were not seated until 12:30pm. We waited 40 min for food. Every plate we received was ice cold except one. Which is the one that they were waiting on to bring us everyone else's plates. I ordered the eggs Benedict with spinach and bacon. The hollandaise sauce on top was not runny instead clumpy and cold. I have been here multiple times and never has my food came out like this. There were 5 of us who sent our food back because it was freezing cold. We then waited another 30 minutes for our new plates to come out it's now 1:55pm and we still not have eaten. 3 out of the 5 who received their new plates were still cold. I don't know if the cooks in the back were playing some sort of sick joke on us but freezing cold eggs are DISGUSTING!!! They also gypped us on the amount of breakfast potatoes that were on our new plates. And one person only got one egg on their chicken and waffles Benedict. This is the WORST experience I have ever had at any restaurant. I barely even touched the second plate they brought out to me. I'd have better luck getting a bacon egg and cheese biscuit from MCDONALDS!! I will NEVER AGAIN come here nor will I recommend this Cheesecake Factory to anyone.

Justyna M.,"Newport News, VA",0,5,,1.0,7/11/2017,We went there on Friday. We were sat outside upon request and greeted by our waiter. We ordered ribeye cooked medium with veggies and shrimp tacos. Food came relatively quickly but I wondered what happened to the bread they always serve. I was told that they don't do it outside unless requested. It took me by surprise because we were there couple times before outside as well and we had bread offered . So right there I knew our waiter had big imagination. He brought bread after all after our food was already on the table. So here comes the fun part. The steak came out well done. Literally no pink whatsoever. We sent it back and after waiting some time the new one  arrived ... well done as well. At that time the manager came by and she looked at the steak and agreed that it was well done . But because we didn't want to wait longer we kept it this time.  My shrimps in tacos were over cooked but not too bad so I kept my food.  So in the end we payed 30 dollars for steak cooked not to our liking ... manager didn't do anything with our check. And the biggest kick was when our waiter told us that our medium is not what they consider  medium. So pink inside considered everywhere as medium is not their medium...  so there you have it.  Not going there anymore. Not worth to waste time on crappy food and service. You decide for yourself .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=100
Raul R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,39,31,2.0,6/4/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory was a disappointment.  My wife and I, along with our 3 kids, came here to meet up with her sister and her family (husband and 2 kids).  First, it took an hour and 10 minutes to seat us, luckily we had to wait for my sister-in-law and her family to arrive, so we waited. Secondly, if we hadn't asked for our free bread, I don't think the waitress would've brought any.  Third, I think their menu is too busy.  There is absolutely too much going on in their menus that had me overwhelmed about what I wanted. Fourth thing, they got my sister-in-law's drink wrong twice.  She eventually just drank the second drink but didn't finish it.  Fifth thing, in my daughter's alfredo dish, she found two long strands of dark hair.  She got a new dish but they still charged us for it. Sixth thing, my wife and I ordered two completely different drinks and for some odd reason they both came tasting EXACTLY alike.  She had the mango mix drink (I forgot the actual name) and I had a tropical mango drink.  Granted they both had mango in it, but I don't think they should've tasted the same.  I think the tropical one should've had a pineapple or coconut type of flavor in it.  Lastly, the bill came out to $102 for 5 dishes, 2 chocolate milks, a soda, and two non-alcoholic drinks.  A bit steep, even for a chain restaurant that has mediocre decor and prides itself on their cheesecake (which we didn't eat because we were so bummed at our entire experience) and ""experience"".  You want some real cheesecake, go to Brooklyn, NYC and have a slice at Juniors ... at least there your bill won't be over $100.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=100

Clarissa L.,"UT, UT",94,48,577,3.0,1/19/2016,"Came here on Saturday night around 630-7. That was a mistake. My friends arrived first and were quoted a wait time of 1 hour and 30-45 minutes. With not a lot of extra space inside due to the large crowd, we waited outside.  I don't know if you recall this particular saturday (just think January winter in Virginia) but it was freezing. After the FIRST hour my friend and I were too cold and hungry to wait outside any longer. We rushed in to feel the warm air wash over our mostly numb bodies and scrambled up to the hostest. Now I was once a hostest and understand the job often sucks, but seriously she had so much attitude and it was absolutely unnecessary.  We asked how much longer our wait was and gave her our name, she scrolled through her computer and found us saying "" you were quoted an hour and a half-forty five minutes, and it's only been..... an hour. You still have to wait"" she wasn't in the least bit polite. I wish I had taken down her name.  So, upset and not ready to go back outside we got in line for cheesecake to have something to hold us over. I got a slice of snickers cheesecake and my friend got a banana, since the man was kind enough to understand my friends lack of appeal towards sugar and allowed him to buy a banana. The line was non existent, but it made it evident that the majority of the crowd was waiting for their ""to-go"" cheesecake as we ended up waiting another 5-10 minutes for it to come out.  Once we got it we dragged ourselves back ourside to the rest of our group informing them of the rudeness from the hostess and showing them the spoils of our journey to the inside. We encouraged our party of seven to go inside to wait hoping the crowded presence would encourage others to eat faster and leave.  Finally our name was called (another forty five minutes later and a second chat with the hostest with the mostest) and were ushered to stand to the side of the host stand. We waited another few minutes for someone to seat us and once arriving at our table the experience was fantastic. Our server apologized for the wait and said all Saturdays are very busy and she brought us bread. Lots of bread. Everyone who ordered the beverages of the alcohol type seemed pleased and we all ordered quickly as we were tired of waiting.  The food came out pretty fast for our semi large group and it all came out pretty close in time to each other even due to the broad assortment of food that was ordered. It was all delicious. At the end, we had been there for a solid four hours. That's right, all other evening plans were spoiled. Why did you stay?  You may be thinking to yourself. Trust me, I tried to convince every one to leave, but their determination prevailed me.  As we waited for our checks we were informed that the point of sales system was experiencing a glitch causing us to wait longer.  Overall the experience was okay and I suppose I'll go back since it is the closest place to get cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=100
Christina N.,"Chesapeake, VA",133,11,8,4.0,6/11/2016,I typically have very nice experiences at the Cheesecake Factory chain. The menu has a wide selection so everyone should find something they like. The staff is well dressed and the decor is classic.  I went last night to this location and our waitress did not pay much attention to us. She walked by our table numerous times without checking on us and took awhile to get us waters and refills throughout the meal. We went early on a Friday night for dinner. There were a lot CF staff and a lot of open tables so I was confused as to why everything took long and we weren't payed attention to.  I will still come back because of the many times that we have enjoyed our visit. Love the food and dessert. I usually get the pasta with shrimp and sausage or the factory burrito grande and for dessert I love the Oreo cheesecake,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=100

There is normally a long wait time, but we only waited for about 5 minutes. The hostess was sweet and immediately greeted us upon arrival. The energy was very high, there were several birthdays being celebrated, so there was good vibes in the air. Our waiter Chris was very attentive and sat us in a couples booth. They are always so busy and the table was clean, but I didn't feel the need to complain about the crunchy crumbs I had sat on. Chris brought our drinks with water in a timely manner. He mentioned several items on the menu and answered our questions about several entrees in a friendly manner. He did not seem bothered or annoyed. He kept the conversation light, crisp, and assuring. He was sure to check on us throughout the evening, and was very patient with my indecisive partner. We didn't get dessert, but he offered to box our food and get anything else we needed. The food was hot and fresh, and the pineapple and passion fruit mojito were a treat to try. We had the Thai coconut chicken, dynamite shrimp, and the pineapple chicken and shrimp. They were all a great mix of texture and taste. I'm sure I'll be returning again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=100

Eric C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",97,30,55,1.0,7/30/2015,"I've been to this location several times before, but this experience was definitely the worst. It's National Cheesecake Day and they advertise the slices of cheesecake are half off. Unfortunately, they fail to mention that it's only 1 half off cheesecake per person that is present. So the cheesecakes I bought for me and my wife, only one could be half off. Boo!  Anyway, I also decided to order some dynamite shrimp since I haven't had dinner yet. What I didn't expect was to wait 30 min for a kid's sized portion of shrimp. I was disappointed that my cheesecakes were bigger than the entire order of shrimp. And I already had my cheesecakes for 15 min, but it was so hot and crowded that my cheesecakes were starting to melt.   The flavor of the sauce for the dynamite shrimp was good, but not enough to rave about it. Also the size of the shrimp was sad. I've had popcorn shrimp from Wal-Mart bigger than the shrimp they used.  I didn't get to eat my cheesecake because it was on the verge of turning to mush, so I had to stick it in the fridge as soon as I got home.  I would've understood if there was a backup on cheesecake orders, but I thought the wait for my food order was ridiculous. I spoke to another customer that ordered food before me, she said she's been waiting over 45 min for 2 entrees and an order of the dynamite shrimp. Our orders came out the same time, but I was seconds away from canceling the order of shrimp and asking for a refund.  Not to mention, the cashier that took my order rolled her eyes when she heard me voicing my displeasure to the other customer about the wait.  I would come back to order cheesecakes, but never order food to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=100

The meat was cooked per request...well done. It was well done, but not stringy.  The mushrooms and onions were grilled just enough to soften, but not enough to make them ""mushy.""  I also had the mixed green salad with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing which was just ""balsamic-y"" enough without being overwhelming.

My meal came first and it had two eggs upside down fried hard, brown, uh, oops.  I pointed the error out to the young lady who brought it from the kitchen (not our server) and she immediately returned it to the kitchen for a correction leaving my english muffin on the table to get cold.  Hubs meal quickly followed and it was delicious.  I picked at it while waiting for my meal, strawberries, pecans, fluffy french toast, yum.   My plate was returned to me with two perfectly poached eggs on top however everything else on the plate, like my english muffins, were no longer hot, luke at best.  The hollandaise sauce was still in the little metal container and it was also cool and congealed.  I mentioned the sauce to our server and he said it's supposed to be like that, room temperature. It wouldn't pour from the container (I did not ask for it 'on the side')!  Seriously?  I pulled some out with my fork and the tong marks remained in it. The eggs were served over crab hash.

Everything--and I do mean everything--was absolutely stellar.  We had a very short wait since we did not have a reservation, but were seated fairly promptly.  We ordered drinks, munched on some relatively tasty bread, and waited for our dinner to arrive.  Both of us ordered combination plates, and between them we had steak diane, chicken madeira, herb crusted salmon, and some kind of tasty shrimp (I can't remember what it was called). We both had mashed potatoes as a side.  Every last bite of that meal was delicious.  Everything was well prepared, attractively plated, and appealing.  That chicken dish was superb and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  We ordered dessert to take home, and both were superb.   Our server was friendly, prompt, and polite without being overbearing.  She kept our drinks full, checked in regularly, and even arranged for some folks to sing Happy Birthday to my daughter.

I know there can be a wait at times, but we came in for a late lunch and were seated right away.   If I had anything less than awesome to say, it would be that there are so many choices on the menu that sometimes it can be hard to narrow down your choice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=200

Alex M.,"Hampton, VA",0,3,,2.0,9/26/2015,"Only reason this gets a 2 star instead of a 1 star is because the wait staff were great. The food, on the other hand, was bland and sub-par. Girlfriend had the Kobe burger and couldn't even taste the meat for all the sauce they slathered on it. I had Farfalle pasta. Barely any chicken in it, it was all covered in a very bland sauce which was vaguely garlic flavored but had zero salt and, thus, was essentially flavorless.  We also had the egg roll sampler at the start. It was good, except for the avocado egg roll, which was literally 100% avocado. I thought it would have something else in it as well, my mistake I suppose. The cheesecake was good, however. I'd probably have flipped the table over by that point if it was like everything else. For the price, you can do much better. I've honestly had better food at fast food places. Might have been an off night for them, I don't know. This was my first and last visit to Cheesecake Factory. Walking in, I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a menu of Mexican, Italian, and American dishes which seemed like a mess to me. The menu was also full of literal advertisements for clothing retailers and websites. Very unprofessional, in my opinion.

Tyi C.,"Rockville, MD",71,6,19,5.0,2/8/2014,"I came here on a double date last night (Friday 8pm), the wait for the four of us was about 20-30 minutes. We were sat at our table on time and the evening was great! Our server was outstanding. He made us feel like celebrities! haha. Everyone ordered an Entrée and enjoyed it. I ordered the Moroccan Chicken Delish! We all shared a dessert and then after that we heading over to Funny Bone. Fun night!! I normally come to The Cheesecake Factory for Happy Hour on Fridays to take advantage of there generous Happy hour menu. You can get full size mojitos, Long islands, Margaritas, Cosmos, and my ultimate favorite the J.W Pink Lemonade. That's what keeps me coming back. The J.W lemonade is what I look forward to by the end of the workweek, haha. They also have the usually well drinks, wine, and beer on special as well. When you walk in just seat yourself in the bar area and you might have to wave down a server to start taking your order. The only thing I don't like about the Happy hour is that you can't sit outside and enjoy the specials. Bummer on a nice sunny day. But the interior is very upscale and inviting. I recommend getting to happy hour a little bit early (between 4pm and 5pm) since their happy hour is only for 2 hours (4pm-6pm). You need to allow enough time to look over the extensive menu and order as many drinks as you need. Because at 6:00pm on the DOT, you can not order from the Happy Hour menu anymore. Their computers won't even let the servers ring in the specials after 6pm. .  When I say the menu is extensive I mean it! It takes about a good 10 minutes to read the darn thing. My groups favorites are the Nachos, Tex Mex eggrolls, and any of the sliders. The menu definitely has something for everyone in your crowd. You will not be disappointed. 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=180

Josh V.,"Chesapeake, VA",51,58,221,3.0,11/19/2014,"I have been here 3 times and have not once been impressed.  The atmosphere is definitely nice and the ambiance is very appealing, but if you ever try to go during dinner time, be prepared to wait....a long time! This of course isn't their fault but it is a reality.  It's located in the heart of the Virginia Beach town center and so traffic is always pretty high. They do have a nice bar area and everytime I've been it has been packed. i definitely wouldn't recommend trying to bring the kids with you as seating with high chairs is almost an impossible task, and even longer wait. The service, however has always been fine so that is a bright side of this restaurant. I've never been impressed with the food as it's just been ok.  That might be fine if I'm at a restaurant that has a quicker wait time and cheaper price tag, but this is a place that is more upscale. For the price, the food is comparable to any mid level chain restaurant like Ruby Tuesdays. Portion sizes are good but I feel like the menu is all over the place where they do several things ok, but don't particularly shine in any one area except of course....the cheesecakes! Now thankfully, they do live up to their name.  Their cheesecakes are, for lack of a better word, the bomb! The nice thing too is that you can simply go to the cheesecake service counter and get your cheesecakes to go if you don't really want to eat a meal there. I've had a various assortment of their cheesecakes but my favorite is definitely their toasted marshmallow smore.   It's a hefty price ($7 per slice) but it definitely takes me 2 sittings to finish the slice because it's rich, creamy and my stomach can only handle so much goodness at one time. If you have a group and can agree on the same flavor, the whole pie is a MUCH better value.  The only downside is that all their whole pies are frozen so it takes about 2 hours for it to defrost.  Don't expect to be eating it right away if you're looking for a quick fix. As a restaurant, I will definitely not be dining here.  But as a cheesecake place, it definitely does not disappoint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=180
Abbie C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",574,392,624,2.0,11/8/2014,"Came here with my big sis to enjoy a night to ourselves sans work and (her) kids. With just the two of us, we thought we would get seated immediately. The guy manning the hostess desk was new so it took a while for us to get situated. No worries... been in that boat before. He was very nice about it and led us to our table personally. Once seated, my sis and I took a look over the menu. There really was no need since we just ordered what we usually get. After a post massage, we were starving and thirsty. Our waitress gave us the famous bread and some mugs of water. I don't really get why she did not give us any straws, but we asked for them and they got delivered to us eventually. Our food was delivered and both of us had made substitutions. I opted the asparagus instead of broccoli. They were some thick stalks of asparagus. Kinda difficult to eat instead of the thin stalks that they serve at other places. Another disappointment was my entrée of Chicken di Pana  as I did not feel like it was served fresh. It was not as crispy as I have had it before so either it sat in the warming tray for too long or was not cooked right is my guess. Still, it was what I wanted and the flavor was at least there. Both my sis and I were done with our meal and chose to have our leftovers be put away in to go containers while we waited on our cheesecake desserts. In the whole time we had been eating dinner - not one time was our water mugs refilled. Annoying since we were trying to stay hydrated post massage... I can get over that, but it took forever to get our check. Once I got home, I was expecting to eat my leftovers come to find out she had mistakenly given me my sister's entrée instead. Definitely had better service in the past. Quite a disappointing visit this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=180

Trey S.,"Charlotte, NC",476,216,506,4.0,12/23/2013,"Went here on a recent trip up to the Hampton/Newport area.  This Cheesecake factory location is located directly off of Virginia Beach Blvd.  Its in what appears to be a fairly new and nicely maintained shopping center - Virginia Beach Town Center.  Its one of these new style of shopping plaza in which patrons are encouraged to park, get out and walk around to the plethora of shops around the premises.  I will say, you definitely loose the feeling of the local area being surrounded by the many chain restaurants and box stores, but that's the only down side of the location.   Upon walking in, you are immediately struck by the magnificence of the entire restaurant.  The tall ceilings and and open spaces make you feel as if you are going somewhere stately and grand for sure. I went here on a Saturday afternoon, before a concert at Hampton Coliseum.  Being by myself, I just went directly to the quaint bar, located to the right as you enter.  I liked that each spot at the bar was already set with a very assortment of silverware and cloth napkin.  I ordered a beer and the Chicken Factory Grande Burrito. The burrito, in a word, was simply magnificent.  It was bigger than I expected and quite tasty (that's what she said, lol).  It was stuffed full of chicken, cheeses, peppers and onions with a nice scoop of guac on the side.  How can you go wrong?   The service at the bar was great.  The food was magnificent.  The ambiance of the building is stately.  Eat here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=180

J A.,"Cambridge, MA",38,66,65,2.0,7/25/2013,"So conflicted.  Usually, I think of Cheesecake Factory and I think of the weird chain that has unnecessarily decadent restaurants. The VB location is absurd. High ceilings and fake plaster everywhere. It's just a decorative mess that I ponder about quite often.  Then, there's the menu. It never ends. Ads on one page and the other page 20 possible entrees. Just an estimate, but the eating options must exceed 100. Who needs that? The prices are reflective of portion of food and definitely not quality. You'll have leftovers for two consecutive meals after the one you just had. Not bad! If you like mediocre pasta microwaved.  HOWEVER!! That cheesecake. Almost all of them are wonderful. If it's cheesecake time, I have someone drop me off at the front. I go to the cheesecake section, grab one to go and the night is great.  Another great thing about the CF is the Thai Lettuce Wraps. They have a peanut sauce that is delish.  Can we note how crowded this location gets?

Rick S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",73,176,45,3.0,3/10/2013,"After once again learning the lesson, from a recent stop at Kincaid's, that a chain restaurant can still be pleasant, we again visited The Cheesecake Factory at Town Center this past weekend for lunch.  The facility itself is still impressive --- big, open-air spaces, high ceilings, exotic but tasteful decorations, lots of glass and light, tons of real plants, and upscale tables and booths/chairs for guests. After making our way past the cheesecake and dessert station, which sits immediately adjacent to the front door, we were immediately seated and began the walk through the restaurant's huge and very complete menu (I'm still not used to the advertising contained in their menu, but to each his own...).  Our server Brittany was very chatty and informative, and, since we were in a lite-kinda lunch mood, suggested we try their freshly-made chicken soup, along with several other suggestions.  My wife settled on a grilled chicken and avocado sandwich, which was served with bacon, lettuce and tomato and a creamy sauce (?) on grilled sourdough, along with too-salty but correctly cooked french fries, which she found very good (except for the french fries).  I tried the chicken soup, and combined it with a half-sandwich of chicken salad (with almonds) and a small salad.  I think the chicken soup was the hit of the meal, for both of us --- it turned out to be more of a chicken chowder, and included grilled chicken chunks, huge black mushrooms of some sort, green peas, celery, artichoke hearts and red peppers, all mixed in a creamy, thick chicken broth and seasoned with a little black, and probably cayenne, pepper.  Really superb, and saved the day for me from the underwhelming chicken salad (Brittany said it was home-made, but, if so, they need to fire the pantry chef).  And then came the big test of the meal --- cheesecake, or not?  Even though we'd had plenty to eat, we thought long and hard on this --- after all, it's The Cheesecake Factory, right?  So what if you can buy them at Sam's Club --- you can't buy THAT flavor at Sam's Club!  But then we thought about having a slice of THAT flavor --- for us, the Tiramisu, Key Lime Pie or Dulce de Leche --- and decided that it was gonna be hard to improve on a real slice/bowl of any of those yummy desserts by mixing the flavors with cheesecake and putting it all in a graham cracker crust.  Hard to duplicate the consistency of good Tiramisu when you mix it with cheesecake, we thought.  So we passed on the cheesecake, and felt a little guilty --- like we hadn't kept our end of the bargain, when we came in for lunch. So I think this visit was about like the two or three others we've made here --- a lovely, comfortable restaurant outfitted with tasteful furnishings, combined with average plus service, and average minus food, excluding the cheesecake.  Food-wise, we learn again and again the cardinal rule of dining in chains --- figure out what they do best (in this case, cheesecake), and don't get carried away with the rest of the menu.  Every time we come in we say to ourselves that, even though we can buy the same basic cheesecakes at Sam's, we can't eat it in such opulent surroundings in our own kitchen, and we're just gonna get a piece of cheesecake and a coffee.  And I think we've finally decided that that really is the right course of action for a visit here --- although now maybe we'll think about adding a cup of soup, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=280

Taylor W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",2,26,3,1.0,8/3/2014,"Gesh. I hate to do such a negative review because I actually did love this establishment but the mediocre service that my husband and I received was unforgivable.  It was a Saturday evening and as usual around this time they are usually swamped with customers. I was told initially that the wait would be 40 minutes. I had no problem waiting because mind you - this is one of my favorite restaurants. We got there at 6:40...time goes by and it approaches 7:40 so something told me to go inside and see what was taking so long, then I was told ""Oh, we have been waiting for you"". I was confused because our devices never vibrated nor lite up. We were finally seated and we were approached and greeted by our waiter. He seemed to be in a rush and took our order for the appetizers + entrees very quickly. Our appetizers came out in a responsible time. Now on to the entrees, when our food came out it was warm, seemed as though it was waiting for a while before a runner came to give us the food. This is not what I expect from the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Dinner and my husband has the Chicken Madeira which he said tasted like wet chicken. My shrimp was pretty good but - my steak was as hard rocks I kid you not. I was so underwhelmed with everything that night. Our waiter never came to check on my husband and I but strangely enough he was very attentive to everyone else. He would blatantly walk right by our table (seeing that we were out of water) and not even bother to fill up our glasses. I don't know If he thought just because we were a younger couple that we wouldn't tip that well. Let it be known that I tip every well $10-$20 when the service warrants for It. And tonight was a no bueno . So we finished our meal and I asked to speak with the manager, I will say he was very apologetic on the experience that we had and tried his best to fix the situation. He offered some coffee or desert which was nice but if I wanted some desert I could have bought it myself. You know? It wasn't about getting anything complementary It was the principle. And being that I was a regular at this restaurant It really did rub me the wrong way. I don't know if they had a new cook there that night but it was not the best. And definitely not worth the wait.

Boyd B.,"Chesapeake, VA",7,3,,2.0,3/20/2014,"I suppose having to wait to be seated on a Wednesday night at 6:30pm is supposed to be a testament to a quality dining experience. However, our party of ten waited for over an hour. Though the waiter was attentive, he very rushed throughout the meal, passing by my raised hand twice to get to the table directly behind me. This may sound trivial, except for the fact that I could turn my chair around and touch that same table. The high ceilings are beautiful, but the ornate decor belies an incredible misuse of space. All in all, this review would have received at least four stars if the food matched the price tag. Our group ordered the nachos, which were superb. I wish I had eaten more of the nachos than the Moroccan Chicken that I ordered as an entre. The chicken was not seasoned and was drastically overcooked. In addition, it didn't even feel like a full meal. No vegetables? Grilled chicken on a bed of couscous left the meal wanting.  To recap: long wait for EVERYTHING, attentive but oblivious waiter, overpriced and poorly prepared meal, an ineffective use of space, and an aesthetically pleasing, yet noisy atmosphere = 2 Stars.

However, I cannot justifiably rate their food with 5 stars. The 4 or 5 times I've been here to eat their food has left me wishing I had gone elsewhere. Maybe their problem is that their menu is too extensive. I think the cooks must have a hard time perfecting anything when they have 100 different items to prepare. (okay 100 may be exaggerating, but seriously). Why not make your menu smaller and focus on the things you do really well? I wish I could tell them what they do really well, but I've not eaten anything that warrants trying it a second time. Even though the meatloaf is on their ""Signature Specialties"" menu, avoid it at all cost. It's dry and flavorless. Don't waste your time on the Factory Grande Burrito either, another ""Signature Specialty"". This was my most recent attempt at enjoying food there. When it got to my table, the inside was cold. I told my waitress and she asked if I wanted them to make a whole new one or just put it back in the oven to warm up. Instead of waiting for a new one, I just asked her to have it put back into the oven. When it came back to me, you could tell it had been left in the oven too long because now my tortilla was hard as a rock. I dissected the burrito and ate the insides, but the majority of my burrito was rice. It barely had any chicken or cheese. I mean, literally, the burrito was 3/4 rice. My husband ordered a Smokehouse BBQ burger cooked medium-well. The burger was well done, and then some.

And I have nothing but good things to say about this place. I had the lemon Alfredo shrimp pasta with penne pasta substituted for the original pasta that comes with this dish. OMG! It was absolutely wonderful. The flavor was great. The shrimp were perfectly cooked. The pasta was perfectly al dente. I had the Georgia peach which was really good. I had the caramel cheesecake which was also amazing. Both my co workers had the fried macaroni and cheese which was good also. The ambience was great. Our waiter's name was Arturo & he ass absolutely awesome and very personable. We laughed with him often and he was very informative and knowledgeable about every thing on the menu. And he recommended the pasta I order from what I told him I liked. And he was dead on! Awesome advice!

The drinks were good (mojito and a chocolate martini not on the menu), but overpriced. The second time I ordered a Cajun pasta dish, and I swear, I make a better one. The pasta was clearly overcooked, there was no sauce, and the veggies and meat were placed on top of the pasta instead of mixing the two.

It was about 6:30pm and a 5-min wait but we were seated in the worst possible spot EVER. Next to us was a long table of loud party folks which extended into the booth behind us and the people popped their heads up SHOUTING for family members and small children running back and forth. I went to use the bathroom and had to literally go to the complete opposite side of the restaurant to get there which is how I noticed ""Wow. Seriously?"" There were open tables and a huge bar that I would have preferred over our seating area. I returned to our seat, food arrived, and I love all their food, it's always good. Not so for my hubby. He ordered Cajun chicken tenders and they were BLAND!!!! I tried 2. Both bland. But there were dipping sauces. BBQ and honey mustard but.....really?! Tasted like what you'd get from McDonalds and their mcnuggets are BETTER. My food was good. Enjoyed. The coke was ok. A bit devoid of that fresh coke fizz. It was just ok. Tried ordering another one. Same thing. My hubby's cocktail wasn't strong, not much alcohol so he didn't order another, in fact he said our hotel bars cocktails were better. I was disappointed because I wanted my hubs to see how great the food is there and wow....it came up lacking. So I tried with a dessert. That had to help make it a great meal. Godiva brownie sundae. It arrived. Nice pleasing site and big enough to share it but the brownie was sideways and it was just ""ok"" too. We left full.

I know I went straight to the desert with this luncheon experience. I definitely don't come here to often, I do like to once in a while. We all ordered the lunch specials pasta, pasta, pasta and salmon. Boy they definitely aren't skimpy on the entree. I can only imagine the dinner sizes (jeez). My mom had the salmon and she really didn't like it, she said it tasted old not fresh, overbooked and hard. She had me taste it and she was right. I had better salmon and not their specialty, steamed broccoli was cooked to perfection, but asparagus was also overcooked. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, which I hardly do, but it was tasty our waitress recommendation.  It was very tasty as she said it would, but I couldn't eat the meatballs since I'm allergic and it had Italian sausage mixed into it. So she offered to get me grilled chicken in replacement of it. That was reality sweet of her, but the chicken did not have any flavors on them. So I just took it home so I can at least alter it to my taste. (Lol). Both my girls had pasta as well. They ended up not finishing it either. We also tried the flavored lemonades which was very good, I had the Hibiscus lemonade and my mother had the Cucumbers and Mint lemonade very tasty.

Yuniel D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",40,4,,2.0,4/20/2016,"Let me start by saying that my first experience at this Cheesecake Factory was about a year ago when I took my wife for our anniversary.  Never cared much for going to this place, but she wanted to go, so there we went.  After an hour of waiting, not having my sweet tea glass filled even once, and my dinner getting cold while waiting for my wife's food, that never arrived, and the waitresses walking by as if we were not there, I finally had to complain.  Without saying a word back to me, the waitress walked away and showed up with the manager, who was extremely apologetic for the ""misunderstanding"" on their behalf.  Offered to pay for our food (like I was going to pay for it after all that), and gave it to us in a box to take home with us anyways. Fast-forward a little over a year, my daughter received a very distinguished award in school, and against by better judgment I listened to her and took her to dinner here to celebrate for her great accomplishment.  It was Tuesday evening, so I figured how bad could it be?  The waitress was extremely nice and attentive, and provided great customer service.  The place was not that packed, and the appetizer came fairly fast.  However, like my first visit the main course took nearly an hour before the food showed up.  My meal?  A club sandwich.  It's not like I was asking for anything extraordinary, and neither did my daughter and wife. The food was good, but I would rate it ""average"" at best, certainly not worth the wait. So, needless to say, I will not be returning to this place.  As a matter of the fact, I think after this experience it will be extremely difficult for me to ever want to visit another Cheesecake Factory again.  I am a super patient man (sometimes too patient), but my business has to be appreciated with good customer service and some type of timeliness.  I don't care to pay for good food, but not at the expense of an hour wait on ""average"" food.

Emily O.,"Virginia Beach, VA",727,86,517,5.0,12/29/2014,"Ah, The Cheesecake Factory.  Always a solid, non-argumentative ""date night"" go-to.  With your complex menu, poor choice in all-white server attire (I mean, seriously, WHYYYY?!!!), and luxury-casual approach; who wouldn't love you?  Nobody.  That's who. For the longest of long times, I had real issues with you, Oh Cheesecake Factory.  But you, m'dear, have really changed my tune. See, what I've realized about this place is that you must follow one, very simple yet golden rule: FIND WHAT YOU LIKE, GET IT AND GET OUT. Many times I have followed the advice of servers who, while direct and honest are somewhat biased.  Why?  Because they have verrrrrry different tastes buds than I do.  I have tried many things here, including but not limited to:  Factory Meatloaf, Steak Diane, and Chicken Madiera.  None of them fancying my palette. I felt as if, for the longest time, I was constantly being cornered into going here and choosing menu options that were just not for me.  Boring, lackluster foods that left my beady, little heart desiring a fourth meal. That was until I met David.  What a game changer that was. David is a veteran server at Cheesecake Factory that somehow can seamlessly match up your mood/taste buds to the perfect concoction.  He is amazing, splendid, bold, all of the good things that you look for in a server. He matched me up to the Chicken Farfalle but subbed out the chicken for four large, succulent, monstrous shrimp.  Dear lord, it's good.  REAL GOOD. But honestly, what really sent my magic carpet a'riding was the soy-glazed edamame.  It's glorious; simply glorious.  Get it, drown your sorrows in it, propose to it, marry it, have five (beautiful) children with it, and spend your life with it.  It's just THAT good.

Jonathan M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",5,119,38,2.0,5/3/2015,"The dinner actually tasted pretty good. Otherwise, not much great about this place.   We arrived a little before 6 and there were a lot of people already waiting in the lobby. There was no sense of organization at the ""hostess"" or check-in table. Lots of people standing around it and it took us a minute to figure out who was in line and not in line. I think part of the problem is just the setup. It's right next to the cheesecake line and everything just kind of blends in to one. And the hostess didn't care enough to create a traffic flow.   I went ahead and grabbed a menu while we were waiting, because we had some place to be. I'm glad I did, because their menu is WAY too vast. Seemingly hundreds of items, and it even had an insert with more, lower calorie, options. Overwhelming. But, while we were waiting, i found something that sounded good.   At about 6:30 we were seated. Standard vibrating pager to notify you. Really can't complain about the time it took to get seated based on the number of people that were there waiting.    I hate the seating. We were put in a section that is basically one long booth on one side with tables every two feet and each table is supposed to seat a pair of people. I understand they are trying to cram as many people as possible into their space, but this was a bit excessive. No sense of privacy or intimacy. Will never go back for a romantic meal again because it can't be done.    Our server took a long time to come to the table and acted shocked when we told her we were already ready to order. My girlfriend ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and I ordered the Parmesan herb crusted chicken w/vegetables. Server warned us that the jambalaya was incredibly spicy and made sure that's what she wanted.    Drinks took another 5 minutes or so to come out. I ordered water and it came in what looked like a mock beer mug with a giant handle. And no straw. Looked around and realized that's just their practice with water is to put it in that mug and not give you a straw. Straws at least give the illusion of a cleaner drinking experience, so I would prefer to have one. But, I don't think this place cares about stuff like that, otherwise they'd have more of an illusion of privacy in the seating too.   The food took FOR. EVER. To come. We didn't get our food for about 40 minutes. The server kept coming back and saying she was going to check on the food and that this was ridiculous, but it wasn't until about the 3rd time she said that that she told us the chicken was the hold up. What?? Ok... Chicken doesn't take 40 minutes to cook.   The food finally came. The ""vegetables"" looked and tasted like food lion canned green beans. I like canned green beans, but not on a 17 dollar plate. The chicken tasted good. The jambalaya wasn't remotely spicy. Granted I have a high threshold for spicy food, but when the server gives you a warning, I expect it to be HOT. My girlfriend does not have a high tolerance for heat, and she ate it no problem.    We didn't see our server again for a while... When we finally did we flagged her over and said we wanted to order a piece of cheesecake and get our check. We were still eating our dinner, so she asked if we had somewhere to be. I suppose that means she was at least somewhat intuitive, but I was really just starting to get impatient.    It took another 20 minutes to get our check. At this point it's about 740 and we have tickets to a show at the sandler center at 8. For some reason the server kept coming back to our section... She would take other tables orders and come over to our table and give a lengthy apology and tell us how bad sheet about how long everything was taking. This happened 3 or 4 times. Finally my girlfriend just said ""you ARE bringing us our check now, right?"" And she finally did. This wasn't just a problem with us, the people on both sides of us (whose dinner we saw intimately since they were 2 feet away) both were staring off into space, already with to go bags, irritated waiting for their check. We also had to remind her about our cheesecake, which we had to get ""to go"" at this point.    Short, sweet, and to the point. Their cheesecake kind of sucks. You do get a very large piece, which is nice, but I wasn't impressed with either of our pieces. Cheesecake is my favorite dessert and I get it all the time, and this place's cheesecake is incredibly mediocre. Maybe even less than average, which is insane since that's what the place is called. They do have a lot of varieties, which is nice, but they need to taste better.   I had the same impression of this place the last time I went to a Cheesecake Factory, which was about 8 years ago. Way too much to choose from, way too pricy for a chain, food portions are too big (give smaller portions and drop the price!), and the cheesecake is not good.

I can honestly say that it has been a long while since I've been to a restaurant that I was 100% satisfied with my experience. The service was great, but their food was even better! My first time visiting this location, I ordered the chicken Madeira. They said that it was their most famous dish, and immediately when I received my food, I knew why! The chicken was so tender, and the sauce was nothing like any sauce I'd ever tasted. My second visit, I ordered their Fried Macaroni and Cheese Burger. It was smothered in Cheddar Cheese sauce! I was a bit confused as to why their Mac and Cheese is not a part of their regular side choices, but is a premium side, and you must pay a $4 up charge of you want this to be your side.

Stephanie H.,"Suffolk, VA",67,209,23,5.0,5/27/2014,"If you know me personally, you'll know that the CF is one of my favorite and most frequented restaurants. Even if I'm out of town, I'm going to manage to get to a local CF if time permits. My love for the CF started some 12 years ago when I was visiting family in Cali and we were shopping in Macy's at Union Square in San Francisco (if you've read my Macy's reviews, you'll know that Macy's ain't new to me baby) and CF just so happens to be on the freaking rooftop. Personally, I love outdoor dining and any restaurant on the roof with outdoor seating definitely peaks my interest. It was here that I had my first Chicken Madeira and a love affair with CF was born.  Fast forward some years later VB Towne Center was fortunate enough to get a CF!!!!!!!!!! I love this particular location because of the ambiance. Believe it or not, not all CF's have ambiance. They are well outfitted with the finest of marble and waterfallage, recess lighting, leather and shiny fixtures - but some lack that cozy ambiance. I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal here. On the 50+ times I've been to this location, I've only had one bad experience with a server, that was promptly resolved by the manager. I enjoy the Louisiana Chicken and Pasta, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, steak Diane, Orange Chicken, fried shrimp, avocado rolls, spinach and artichoke dip, fried calamari, shrimp and bacon club ANDDDDDDDDDDD the strawberry lemonade amongst other things that I'm sure I left out. I've also had just about every CHEESECAKE on the menu and my favorite is the Peanut Butter Ripple. So darn good.

I was disappointed that for the ambiance they try to create, and the hype behind the name and the restaurant itself that I got the same boring food I could just about at any other chain for a lot less. I had pasta which I felt was just a large portion size with no thought process at all behind it on how to actually make it different. I understand that the place is a chain, but I really wanted the place to surprise me. I will say that the cheesecake is good.

Drinks, bread, large plates of pasta, & of course dessert.  We dined in last week & everything was delicious. We went on a weeknight & there wasn't a wait. I love the Asian Pear Martini...so good. Our waiter was super friendly. He even ordered for my boyfriend who couldn't decide between the Jambalaya or some other Cajun style dish. He chose the Jambalaya & my bf was happy that he did. I tried something I never had before & went with the Bistro Shrimp pasta. It was delicious. It was so large that I was able to make two meals out of it.

Anyways, we were overwhelmed by the 20 page menu, like always. She took our drink order and quickly came back. Very fast! So for an appetizer we ordered the fried mac n cheese balls. I was not expecting them to be so good. There were four very large mac n cheese balls served with what i think was a vodka marinara sauce, i could be wrong, that worked amazing with them. I could have ate those for dinner and been good. But i ordered the house burrito which has rice, beans, grilled chicken, an assortment of a corn salsa, guac, sour cream etc. I always order it. Its HUGE! And it tastes amazing. Of course i only ate half to save room for Chris' cheesecake....which is actually a brownie cheesecake cake hybrid chocolate monstrocity of epic proportions.  Overall, service was perfect, food was quick and tasted great and dessert was wonderful.  If anyone from management reads this, consider putting a cheesecake sampler on the menu. Smaller bite sized pieces of your different flavors of their choosing would be wonderful.

If you're a bit more adventurous and enjoy seared Ahi tuna, you definitely want to order the Tempura Ahi tuna roll. This is the appetizer that I could eat every single day! The sauce that comes with it makes that flavor explode! I come back just for this! As far as amazing entrees, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta is GREAT! I used to only get that every time I came.

Justin V.,"Norfolk, VA",234,141,646,3.0,8/28/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory in Virginia Beach actually isn't a bad place to dine. I find it a little surprising, though, that it's constantly busy because it's not a great place - just a good place. TCF is a bit more of a jack-of-all-trades spot, witness to the seemingly endless amount of items on their menu.  I've dined here sparingly since it opened around 2004-2005, but I've had a pleasant experience each time. The service is very friendly and responsive, and that's really all you can ask for with the front of the house. The only qualm I have with the FOH is the wait, but that's because everyone goes here. Dinner service is tricky because there's a guaranteed wait, but I've had brunch where there's no wait at all. In regards to the food, it's decent. TCF goes out of its way to provide something for every type of foodie, so I applaud them on their diverse selection. That goes a long way towards customer loyalty and thus, repeat business. But that approach is a double-edged sword as there isn't an outstanding menu item (except for their cheesecake, of course) on the list. If they dropped a few items from the menu they can make inroads into making the remaining items outstanding, rather than good. But hey, maybe that's what people want. In my opinion, I want outstanding, especially for the prices they're charging. For anyone trying to impress a date or appease out-of-town friends/relatives, this is a go-to spot. It's centrally located, easy to find and there's something on the menu even the pickiest eater may like.  JV",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=220

My last chance was to pick up a piece of cheesecake at the front counter. I walked in and the server had her back to me. I waited like 3 minutes and know that she saw me. I then asked ""Are you the person to help me"".  She turned around and said very rude "" yeah, i am the one!"". I told her what I wanted and she grabbed a piece out of the freezer and threw it on the counter...yes.,literally threw it on the counter. Needless to say, the piece of cheesecake toppled over in the package. I told her I did not want that one (especially since I was paying $9.00!!!!!!) and she grabbed another and threw the other piece in the sink.  WTF???  This was really the last time I go in this hole where they put their old cheesecake in the freezer and try to sell it to the -take out- customers.  BEWARE of this trick.  The cheesecake tasted almost sour.  Perhaps they will change their ways when people don't show up at their noisy restaurant anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=220

Charles C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,9,,2.0,12/23/2015,"Go here about once or twice a year with the family for special occasions. Not a cheap place to go for dinner but the servings were always large and the food prettu good. Went more for the atmosphere and ambiance than anything else. Went tonight and tried the Chicken Madeira which was my first time. The chicken tasted good and was moist, however, for 17-18 bucks I expected a lot more on the plate. The potatoes were okay but slightly undercooked and not mashed enough. Medium sized chunks of potatoes were in there, maybe because it was too tough to mash. My mom got the chicken di raza? It was a parmesan chicken than came out really dry, but her potatoes came out well done. Sister got the avocado chicken sandwich and that was stellar and excellent according to her. My brother got the orange chicken which is what he always goes for, and I must say he would usually share some, but barely had enough on the plate to share. The same plate would come heaping full at other times, this time it was barely a full plate. We usually pass food around and enjoy the time together, but this time it wasn't as enjoyable due to the okay to blah food for the most part. He did say it seemed like they used too much soy sauce on his orange chicken and when I tasted it, it seemed wayyy too salty. And it was white rice he asked for, so that should have tamed it down a bit too, but it was too strong. The cheesecake as always was the best part, and the pumpernickel bread. I got bored half way through my meal and went back to the bread. Considering we spent well over a hundred bucks here, will probably not come back here again. It's usually a great place for a family meal, but the portions have gotten significantly smaller, the prices stayed the same, and the food much lower in quality. Will try some more of the local places next time around and spend less money and probably be more authentic. Give it two stars for the decor and lighting, it's beautiful inside. I must say though, the constant clattering of plates and other things in the kitchen can be heard while eating, management may want to consider putting a wall up or atleast a sound partition. Felt like someone broke plates almost every 5 minutes. Our waitress was extremely cool, came around and filled up our drinks when we needed, and was very attentive but not overbearing.

Greg F.,"Alexandria, VA",385,577,313,2.0,12/3/2012,"I would love to give this place a higher rating, but twice they almost killed my wife, so no more than two stars here. My wife is allergic to cilantro. We make this perfectly clear every time we go in. This last time we even told our server the story. So, we start our meal off the fried dumplings like we always do. They come out on a plate in the sauce this time instead of a cup on the side to dip them in. Okay... clearly some changes were made. Not a big deal right? Wrong. They now put cilantro in the sauce!!!! Although our server was very nice, hello. We just told you a story about this place almost killing her from cilantro and you serve her cilantro. Damn! As soon as I took a bite I immediately told my wife to stop chewing as she was still on her first bite. See, I love the stuff and can taste it clear as day. Luckily, she had an epi pen on her so she stabbed herself in the leg and no death occurred. When we asked for the manager to come over it actually took him a few minutes. Then he stood there with this blank look on his face. This, well you're not dead look. He had no idea how to handle the situation. He comped our meal (packed the order to go while I went and got the car) but charged us for the dessert. To top it off, when we got home lemon cake didn't taste anything like it did before. They made some changes to the menu that sucked. A couple of items they removed I really enjoyed. Then they made changes to existing dishes like mentioned about. My four cheese pasta was terrible. Whatever you were doing in the past was good (as far as flavor), what you are doing now is wrong...

Meghan B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",114,3,,1.0,1/9/2014,"Unfortunately, this restaurant isn't baby-friendly; or, at least, not accommodating for children who are not able to sit in high chairs yet.  While I understand not allowing the stroller to be by the table, there isn't a secure place to leave the stroller while eating and there isn't a good place to put the infant car seat. Usually, restaurants have a high chair that can be turned upside down for the car seat, but the ones supplied here not only are not safe for that but they even have warning labels against it. So, our car seat is squeezed between the booth and the table.

It was right off the bat I asked the hostess ""can we have a booth?"" When she replied ""yeah, that's where I'm taking you"" with the worst attitude. Then we sat and the server asked if we wanted lemon and we said yes. Then she returned with a glass with no lemon.... Turns out we showed up in time for happy hour. So we moved to the bar. The new server was even worse. She never checked on us or on our food, which was awful. Sour cream on my nachos was frozen like ice cream, and grizzle was crazy on my slider, I thought i chipped a tooth seriously.  Then we ordered a Togo an it was all good, but then the server came back right before the food came out and said we could get happy hour food Togo that she couldn't box it. It was super inconvenient and unprofessional. So she brought out a big plate of food we asked to have to go, and a tiny box for us to put it in. At this point I was furious and ready to go. I walked up to the bar and asked the tender for a box myself. Boxed my own food. And left. NEVER TO RETURN!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=260

Desiree A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",111,36,34,5.0,2/17/2011,"I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. I hear that this restaurant chain is generally a hit or miss based on location, but The Cheesecake Factory in Virginia Beach is definitely a HIT! I grew up with The Virginia Beach Town Center, and the very first restaurants to be built at the Town Center were Smokey Bones, P.F. Chang's, and The Cheesecake Factory. This is probably the most beautifully decorated restaurant I have seen in America. Haha~ No lie. The ceiling paintings/wallpaper/I don't know what are absolutely beautiful. The place is romantic, and I don't think I've ever seen this place lagging. It's always filled with people with waiters running around. That's how popular this place is! However, this is downfall of The Cheesecake Factory. It's always so crowded! Even the bar! There's outside seating, but y'know, most people eat inside. It's always packed, and I think the longest I've had to wait for a table was at least an HOUR. They DO take reservations until 5pm, though. If you need a table past 5, I'd say reserve one for 5pm, but that doesn't save you alot of time. Additionally, the lighting at night is too dull, so it can kinda make you sleepy, but with people bustling around you, you should be okay. Although the prices are kinda high, the portions and the yumminess of the food definitely make up for it. The portions are proportionate to the price if not more. I have not tasted anything in this place that wasn't good! (I always get the herb-crusted salmon by itself or with something like shrimp, then I try my friends' food. Haha~) I don't need to say anything about the cheesecake, do I? All you need to know is that they're heavenly! I came here for lunch after my high school graduation, and they would sing to you. I came here for my 19th birthday with 24 people, and they were super accommodating, and they decorated my cheesecake! I'll post a picture up here. :D Anyway, love, love, LOVE this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=260

JeriLynn H.,"Severna Park, MD",60,106,60,3.0,6/23/2014,"My husband and I came here for lunch on our anniversary.  We remembered that other cheesecake factories in the other states we've been to are a zoo at dinner time, so lunch was chosen.  Parking was such a pain! On street parking everywhere, parking lot parking all filled..they did have parking garages, but I have a fear of those.  When we were approaching there was many people outside waiting and also inside waiting.  To our surprise we were seated right away, table for 2 was instantly seated. We asked to be seated outside, and were put at this cramped little table next to a pillar. The table was fine but barely enough room for two.  Our waitress came up promptly and we ordered something off the drink menu and an appetizer, the fried Mac and cheese balls are amazing!  Eventually she came back with our drinks and we ordered our meals.  However, she never brought us any water.  We were waiting for our appetizer when a girl walks by with what we ordered and asks a different table if they ordered it, if I would not have noticed and spoke up she may have never found our table.  We finished our drinks and there was still no sign of our waitress, a different girl brought us our meals and we ordered drinks from her. The same girl brought the drinks we ordered from her to us as our waitress finally appeared and was in the process of asking if we needed drinks. We had also ordered cheesecake to go through this other girl since we were unsure when we would see our waitress again.  Overall the experience was similar to other cheesecake factories, but the service was under par. If it wasn't for that other girl, we would have probably not ordered another drink or cheesecake.  I don't think we will be back, the food was great as always, between the parking and this being the only one around for miles (I live on the otherwise of the tunnel).  I really hope they open one closer",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=260
Natalie R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,147,5,4.0,6/3/2014,For once there was not a long wait which is the main con for me. The drinks and desserts are always amazing. I recommend the limoncello torte or Linda's cake if you're a chocolate lover. For dinner I had the chicken bellagio. It is great. The basil pasta was cooked perfectly. The menu is rather large and can be a bit much but everything ordered is usually good. The only other complaint I have aside from the wait time is the wait staff. They are usually  very friendly and attentive when you have their attention. Due to the place being so large and busy you may wait a several minutes before they can get to your table just for drinks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=260
Marie T.,"Naples, FL",0,6,,2.0,1/7/2016,"Traveling on business and sat at the bar alone on a busy night. I ordered Shrimp Scampi and specifically asked for bread. 8 minutes go by, no bread. I ask the bartender again (I know it's not their fault, they were very attentive). Another 5 minutes goes by, no bread. I ask again and finally it arrives. Takes quite a while for the scampi to arrive and when it does, there is almost NO sauce. They basically brushed the bottom of the plate with a paper thin layer of sauce and piled plain noodles and shrimp over it. So dry. Sigh. I ask for a side of sauce. By the time it arrives, my food is cold. Not much flavor to scampi and the breading on the shrimp was thick and mushy. I appreciate that the portion of shrimp was generous but unfortunately I did not enjoy them at all. For a $20 pasta I was extremely disappointed.

Amanda R.,"Newport News, VA",109,131,22,3.0,9/6/2012,"Came here just for dessert over the weekend. I ordered a slice of the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake, and my date ordered the Oreo Extreme Heart Diabetic Coma Cheesecake (or whatever it's called). We arrived about 45 minutes before closing time on Saturday, and had a server that was definitely feeling the stress of a long shift. He had a very harried demeanor, and his attempts to be friendly came off very cold and abrupt. He plopped down platters of bread and butter and disappeared before introducing himself or even asking if we wanted bread. Once he came back & we told him we were just ordering dessert, I guess he felt bad for not asking, so he started pummeling us with questions about our lives to make up for it... which was odd, since he never stood in one place long enough to receive answers to those questions.  ""You guys aren't hungry?"" *disappears* ""All that cheesecake - want a drink to go with it? Haha!"" *flees* ""So what brings you all in so late?"" *vanishes into thin air* Enough about the server though. The cheesecake was delicious, as usual. If you're a big chocolate lover, go for the Oreo Cavity Making Blood Sugar Skyrocketing slice. It's tasty. [If you finish it in one sitting, though, I cannot be held responsible for your impending doom.] Make sure you go earlier in the day though.

Amanda B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,1,,1.0,11/9/2014,"Wait Time: Way too long. I went on the weekend, saturday evening. You cant make reservations, they have a first come, first serve policy...which is strange because similar competitor restaurants (BRAVOS or PF CHANGS) allow for them. So a party of 3 around 8 o clock waited 45 min for a booth. Space: Waiting for the table was of course uncomfortable because there is minimal waiting space. This results to a large crowd of people taking up the walk-in space, confusing the seating process, and the pick up area immediately to the right of the entrance. Tip: tell the host that you are in a party of three or four instead of two, even if that is your real number or request a booth only, if you do not do this, they will seat you in an uncomfortably tight position next to a stranger. We witnessed many couples be sat in odd booth/table arrangements that forced them to be sat next to strangers, and we also witnessed half of those people demand to be relocated in a larger space. For those who did stay in the awkward seating for fear of complaining were subject to an uncomfortable dinner because there is no privacy! Food: We possibly did not order the best dishes that the factory has to offer, but being first timers, our server made no recommendation and offered no advice...huge no no. Honestly, we have received better knowledge of the menu and local favorites by servers with lower expectations at chains such as Chilis or Applebees. Anyway, we ordered,and half of us received bland food, while the other half received cold food. So, we waited 45 min to be sat, then an additional 25 min to receive our food...cold and sub par. To make matters worse, one person received his food 5-7 min before the rest of us, his was hot, but once the rest of us were served, our food was not even warm. It was almost comical as if someone was playing a bad trick. While a member in my party requested extra condiments to cure the blandness, I requested my food to be delivered to me hot. The server asked me if i wanted the food reheated or prepared. I told her i was entitled to fresh food. Over All: I then waited an additional 25 min to receive my food correctly without a word from a manager or any decent attempt to make things right. We will never return. If anything this place is overrated. If you ask me, this place is for people who like to feel important, and spend little money. It is not an expensive place by any means but it gives the diner a grandiose type of experience...when they're not slipping and sliding on the greasy floor. Lucky for the factory the appearance of quality attracts people, however the actual quality of my experience will repel me from ever returning. My advice: Save a few extra bucks and go to a place like Applebees, you'll save yourself two hours and the aggravation of a sub-par performance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=260

The space is large and decorated like other Cheesecake Factories.  Our waiter was attentive and fairly prompt.  We love their bread basket, and their extra-large drinks, which mean never needing a refill.  I enjoyed my tomato-basil pizza, and my boyfriend liked his burger.  We split a piece of the chocolate chip cookie dough, which was divine as always.  I'd definitely return here when visiting the area.  It's reliable, good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-virginia-beach?start=260

I had barely touched my plate and the server noticed but didn't offer any sort of replacement nor cut our check down at all. And as for my husbands sushi, it was quite obvious we weren't in an actual sushi bar. We are both big sushi fans, but not for theirs. His veggies were soaked in sauce and were a bit mushy, and my fries were very bland. The calamari was the best part, but still not great.
