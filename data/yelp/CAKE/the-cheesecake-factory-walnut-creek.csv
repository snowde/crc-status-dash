Pink L.,Bay Area,11,133,160,3.0,1/16/2011,"Love the Red Velvet cheesecake with some Starbucks coffee!  Delicious!  Other than that, I'm not a big fan of their entrees tho the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken was good.  Had some moist and dry areas to the chicken.  Beware that the mashed potatoes and everything on the plate had black pepper on it.  I found it odd that it came like that since there's black pepper on the table and unfortunately I'm kind of allergic to it, so it ruined my meal a bit.  Anyways, this place gets really busy weekend nights and thankfully for Joe who helped our large party have a table ready at the time requested.  He's great!  So, ask for him when you have large parties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1180
Dana T.,"Burlingame, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/7/2011,"My party of six adults and two children arrived at 5:45 p.m. at the Walnut Creek location for a Birthday dinner.  We knew we would have a wait because the restaurant does not take reservations and we did not want to sit in the outside dining area.  We waited, and waited, and waited in the bar area and then were told that our table was ready at 7:30 p.m..   Unfortunately, the table was outside and we had specified inside.  The manager for the evening advised us we would be seated soon and that he was doing everything in his power to get us a table.  Since we had given up our seating in the bar area, we were forced to stand and sit on the floor on the side of the restaurant because there was no seating for patrons waiting for a table. Additionally, some friends of ours in a group of eleven had also come for a birthday dinner at the restaurant.  After arriving at 6:30, they were seated at least 40 minutes prior to us.  Obviously, management chose to seat the party of eleven before us. The night manager completely ignored us and went out of his way not to walk anywhere near us, because he knew we were angry.  We were finally seated around 8:00 p.m. but not at one table, but two. Because this was a birthday dinner, we wanted to sit together and ended up squeezing into one booth. At the end of the evening, (after my brother, two kids and wife had to leave because his daughter was ill after eating the meal), another manager came to the table and tried to fix this mishap.  The restaurant never offered an explanation for our treatment, but tried to fix it by offering a free appetizer (that only fed six and we had eight in our party), paid for the the birthday entree (but not dessert), and reimbursed us the $5 for a child's meal. I have been going to the Cheesecake factory long before it was ever in the Bay Area and I have always thought favorably of their service, food and management, until I went to the Walnut Creek location.  I will never eat there again. Maybe it is too much to expect to be treated with dignity in an establishment that, obviously only cares about the bottom line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1180
FairMe R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,36,6,5.0,5/31/2011,"I live in WC and go to this place at least once a month. I love it! Food is always delicious. Waiters are nice. Even if sometimes they forget things, I always give them a break - the place is incredibly busy and it is possible to become forgetful. They also started to provide complimentary baby platter with banana and bread pieces for babies. Isn't it cute? Whoever loves avocado, take avocado rolls. For fish lovers, take Wasabi crusted tuna - it will become your favorite for the rest of life! Enjoy!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1180
Coopdawg C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,148,,2.0,2/1/2010,"OK, this is an about-face for me.  I've always enjoyed the food, but here's the deal. They put chicken in almost EVERYTHING.  As a vegetarian this is unacceptable.  They kind of sneak it in to things that appear perfectly vegetarian, and these are things that could do perfectly well without adding chicken or some sort of meat to them. It's really like they're gerring free chicken and HAVE to use is.  Look at their menu,  It's HUGE, but almost everything has chicken this or that.  Hard to get away from. I wouldn't know about their use as an ingredient unless I asked and the particular server knew. I suppose I'll be going there a lot less if at all.  I'd rather go where they respect vegetarians and their reason for being such.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1180
Elke M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",12,75,16,4.0,3/18/2009,"We went on opening night and knew to go early.  We got in line at 5:30 and were seated by 6:00. We went with another couple and ordered 5 or 6  sdifferent things to share so we could all taste alot of different things.  Amazingly, the service, food, organization, etc, for opening night, were all excellent!!!  We had at least 10 different servers and staff come over to our booth and talk or ask how everything was.  Everything we ordered was wonderful.  We actually thought the cheesecake was the least delicious.  The corn fritters were awesome!!!! The decor is beautiful and the existing staff from all the other locations training the new staff seemed to work really well.  Can't say anything bad at all about our experience.  This is the first time we had ever been to a Cheesecake Factory, and frankly I wasn't expecting it to be as upscale and the food as good as it was.  Very pleasantly surprised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1180
Katie G.,"Austin, TX",1,4,,1.0,7/19/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes! My favorite is by far the white chocolate raspberry truffle! However, the service at this location is awful. I have two kids and am pregnant with my 3rd and decided I would call for curbside service, I was craving my favorite cheesecake and my 2yr old had just fallen asleep. I ordered they said 10min after almost 25min a girl came out with my bag of two cheesecake slices. She said the total and I gave her $3 extra for running it to my car luckily I had cash because if you pay with cc or don't have exact change they go inside and you have another wait. I'm surprised they don't have the ability to swipe a credit card on the spot. Nevertheless I live about 30min from this store and I arrived home to find that not only did I not get what I ordered I was stuck with a very Oreo cheesecake hardly to be desired if you are expecting raspberry. I was very disappointed and ended up throwing away both because they were so awful big disappointment! Will not go back a big waste of money! I ordered a very easy order I am surprised they screwed up so bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1180
Elizabeth T.,"Brentwood, CA",20,53,6,5.0,1/17/2011,"Love The Cheesecake Factory, this one has to be my favorite because it is only 5-10 minutes from my home :) I have been here a few time and haven't been disappointed.  I have tried many dishes and about 8-10 different cheesecakes. My favorite has to be the Red Velvet Cheesecake, highly recommend, you should try this one! Our parties are usually 2-4 people so our wait is never long, service is quick and everyone is very friendly. Don't have any negative remarks plus the movie theater is across the street and you can either valet for $7.00 or park in one of two free parking garages plus it is close to a lot of different shops!

I wasn't expecting so much elegance in this restaurant! It's freaking gorgeous the minute you step in the doors you feel like you're at a Las Vegas 5 star hotel lobby!!! Anyways besides the ambiance which is superb! The food was also excellent! I had the Skinny Grilled Salmon with Yummy Grilled Veggies! Super scrumptious! Then my co-workers convinced me that if you come to Cheesecake Factory, you MUST have their cheesecake! And yeah they have a whole two pages of probably at least 30 different cheesecakes to choose from! How can you resist??? So I chose the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake. ABSOLUTE HEAVEN!!!!!!!! I had to take half of it home it was so huge!!! And the staff, AWESOME! Very attentive, friendly, great attitudes, everyone acts like they love their jobs, smiling happy servers!

Ann T.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",34,5,,4.0,3/26/2011,"OK gotta say the meal and service I had tonight was amazing.  Had the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.  I always have to read the nutrition guide here before I eat so that I'm not consuming 2000 calories in one dish.  This salad came in around 490 which is light for the Cheesecake Factory.  The tuna was AHmazing.  I kid you not.  Was shocked as all get out.  Our service was great.  We had our 2 year old with us and they brought her some bread and banana when we sat down.  They even put in her order first and had a very reasonable $3.95 pasta with butter and cheese which of course she loved.  Service was fantastic too.  Friendly and very efficient, and nice to my kid without being scary.  The place was slammed at 6:00 PM on a Saturday and while told we would have to wait 20-25 minutes it was 10 minutes tops.  Was quite pleasantly surprised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1180
Nick G.,"Lafayette, CA",7,14,7,3.0,3/17/2009,"OOOO cheesecake factory....   Lets start with the service. The wait was reeeeeeeaally long, but I was prepared for it.  Wouldn't expect anything different from a brand new restaurant.  The host staff was very friendly and helpful and Im pretty sure estimated our wait time correct to the minute.  (I started in the restaurant business as a host and I dont think I was ever able to do that) The food was great.  We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer (My gf ate the artichoke and I licked the salt off the leaves) , fried mac n cheese (I love fried food), orange chicken (fresh orange zest and fresh chicken made this better than Panda's orange chicken mmmm) , caesar salad, and four seasons pizza.  They messed up and gave us the large pizza instead of the lunch size so that was a nice bonus.  Portions were huuuuuge.  The Bad...  It took 45 minutes from when we finished our apps to get our entrees.  We had to ask twice if they were coming and I was late for work because I didnt expect my lunch to take 2 1/2 hrs.  Also, our waitress boxed our pizza for us and crammed the entire thing into a small box... When we got home it was one big mushy ball of toppings and cheese.  I know they have pizza boxes, but not for us I guess. Overall, I was very impressed with the food..  I came in skeptical because I didnt think that the food would be that great, since the kitchen has to know how to prepare the hundreds of items on the menu, but was very happy with the food. Service....

Since she is partially disabled, she has a hard time getting around without a cane. This being said, when dropping our car off at the valet, who we waited on for 15 minutes, the back patio area had been washed off making it slick and hard to maneuver. Once inside, they made us climb a couple of stairs to get to a table not once pointing out the ramp on the side of the room or allowing us to sit at a table on the ground floor.

They all had these huge guilty grins on as if to say, ""WE'RE HAVING SO MUCH FUN, I CANT WAIT TO SERVE YOU HAND AND FOOT, SERIOUSLY, I CANT WAIT!"". Bless their souls, they were all so very eager and sweet that I couldn't pop their eager beaver bubble and tell our waitress that she had a mysterious piece of red something stuck between her two front teeth. Oh well, clearly even she can attest to their divine cuisine.  I have nothing bad to say about my experience. Our main purpose for being there was to simulate a 'real' customer and a 'real' service experience for their newly hired staff. Though my burger was brought out 10ish minutes later than my dates, I couldn't complain, my conversation with my date was so sparkling that I didn't even notice.

We were immediately greeted, and told that there was open seating in the bar AREA. Apparently, what they meant was open seating AT the bar. After sitting around for awhile, we caught a waitresses attention to get menus. Finally our server came and told us that we were sitting in a closed area, so that's why we weren't being helped. She took our orders and was friendly enough. There ended up being a little mini rice bowl in my garden salad. That was the end of that.

But when you have a party of ten you have to wait for the manager to approve you or okay the fact that you are being added to the list... This took twenty minutes to get the manager to talk to you. So once we finally got our name on the list we then had to wait an additional hour and a half. So over all just ten minutes shy of two hours. So our buzzer goes off, and so we go in to check and the host is beyond rude. She looks at us and says oops not you guys. So we ask how much longer, and without even lifting her nose up from the computer she starts to stare at us and rolls her eyes. Seriously?  Then we continue to wait for 30 more minutes and are sat close to closing. The server started out really great, but towards the end you could tell we were an inconvenience to her and her wanting to go home. We ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees. With the intentions of ordering dessert. It just kept getting worse, food was cold, cooked wrong, server started to get rude with us. So we asked to talk to a manager. And he simply was just a waste of breath and time to talk to. He thought by ""buying"" desserts for us that it rectified the situation.

This spot has been poppin off ever since it opened.  We had to wait for the rest of our party to arrive so posting it at the bar was the best decision we ever made.  Finding a seat at the bar is a mission in itself  but my girl an her man got here early and managed to get us a prime spot...major score!  Her Sangria looked tasty and she ordered quite a few so I'm guessing it was a winner.  I, however, was too stuck on my Mojito's to stray.  Hubs got a Well-Mannered Dirty Martini and my boy got a beer.  We also ordered the Fried Macaroni and Cheese for an appetizer.  Umm yeah, whoever came up with frying mac and cheese is a freaking genius! On to dinner.  Everything up to this point had been good (including service) and I was wondering about the mediocre rating of this place.  Then my dinner arrived.  Yes, I think you know where this is going.  Major disappointment.   I haven't had anything fried in I don't know how long (I know right) and being that it was Friday, I was in a ""fry"" kind of mood.  The fried mac and cheese set it off so I decided to go with my usual at CF which was the Navajo sammich (fry bread - yum) with fries (I was bound to OD after such a long drought) and a side or ranch dressing.  The ranch dressing is key and helps make this dish.  Unfortunately, they really effed it up.  Their dressing is homemade and done in house and typically I love it.  They clearly got the recipe wrong (insert expletive here).  Even the fries were ehh.  Sammich was OK but it was all just off.  I tried the Hubs Garlic noodles and it was blah blah bland.  I totally regret ordering dinner and should have just went for a slice of cheesecake (too full after even though I did not finish my dinner).  Oh, did you know they now have a red velvet one???  And it has my name written all over it...literally.  So would I go back...sure, but for the bar only.  I should make mention the drinks are pretty pricey though (damn passion fruit mojito got me hooked).  Our bar tab was more than our dinner tab (real talk).  The only food I would order is the appetizer and/or a cheesecake (hellooooo Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet).  Other than that, I would rather drink my calories here, thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1200

Van C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,34,,3.0,2/27/2011,"Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite places to eat, but through the years, the quality has gone down hill.  This place is probably the most unhealthy place I go to. Most of their menu is high calorie, which is probably why it tastes so good. The portions are so big that you eat a third of it, and you're pretty much done.   The staff is usually friendly and fast. But the last time we went, we got seated at a table with no silverware, and it took the waiter 10 minutes to introduce himself and ask us about drinks.  I would have understood if they were packed, except the restaurant was not even half full. Their namesake cheesecake, is pretty good.  It always comes with whipped cream on top and at the tip of the cake, it has a specific artificial, commercially made taste.  Through the years, I've tried their Red Velvet, Banana Cream, Key Lime, Tiramisu, Oreo cheesecakes.  My favorite is hands down the Red Velvet, hold the whip cream, of course.

Lynsey T.,"Livermore, CA",237,133,28,4.0,1/5/2010,"This Cheesecake Factory is in a great location, right across the street from a movie theater, within walking distance of Walnut Creeks down town shopping destinations and another plus is that there is plenty of parking on the weekdays. Come the weekend though, don't count on finding a parking space right off the bat.  As you may have guessed by the parking on the weekends, or lack there of, this place is down right packed!  Even before you get through the front doors, one must step slowly and carefully through a sea of people. Upon crossing the threshold, you can hardly get through the lobby area, to the customer service desk, to procure one of those pager thingys just so you can wait 35 minutes for a table. *whew*   It is worth the wait though. Their food and table service have never disappointed me and seem to be consistent with every location I have visited.   Most recently, I visited their bar area for a coffee and the bar tender was such a great salesman that I ended up purchasing a slice of cheesecake to take home with me.  He didn't have to twist my arm to far though.  ;-p  and it didn't hurt that the coffee was superb. Recap: Give yourself time for parking if you want to go on the weekend or most nights of the week. While you're at it, give yourself some more time to wait for a table.

James P.,"San Ramon, CA",1,16,,1.0,3/7/2009,"Called the Cheesecake Factory Saturday afternoon to find out if they had a happy hour, and what time and days it was available.  The hostess who answered the phone told me they did and it was between 4pm and 6pm.  I specifically asked her if it was available today, Saturday, and she said yes.   Arrived at the Cheesecake Factory at 4:15 and waited for a high table in the bar for 30 minutes.  Once we sat down, it took 5 minutes for someone to come over and clear the previous diners plates and wipe of the table.  Another 5 minutes went by before the waitress came by and delivered menus.  We asked her for a happy hour menu and she informed us that they did not have one.  I explained to her that I called ahead and was told that it was available.  Then a manager came by and explained that they didn't have a happy hour, when i pressed him he admitted that they did on weekdays.  I asked to see the menu and he told me they didn't have one.  I pressed again and he was able to let me look at it, but I couldn't order from it.  So we ordered some appetizers and a pasta dish which took forever to come out.  The service was terrible throughout the meal, and we were constantly crowded by tons of employees just standing around chatting and laughing.  It was incredible to see the waiters and waitresses and runners, just standing around blocking the aisles and crouding tables.  I would estimate that there were probably as many employees in the place as there were customers, yet the service was still incredibly slow.  If this place plans to survive, they have to get a new manager and actually train their employees.  I am going to give this place a few months to work out the kinks, and then maybe I will try them out again.  Oh... and the bar service was probably the slowest I have ever seen at place.  Since I was sitting in the bar, I watched people wait for their drinks and some people literally waited 30 minutes to get a bottled beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1320
Kris S.,"Oakland, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/25/2010,"Went to Cheesecake Factory in Mid-June 2010, with a party of 8, and am here to discourage anyone from going to this place with a large party (8 or more).  The service, and the whole experience was an amazing exercise in poor service, poor training, and bad execution. This has nothing to do the the food.  I'll leave it to others to talk about that.   The eight of us arrived at 7p.m., knowing that they did not take reservations, and prepared for a wait.  I was told that ""eight was a party"" and I would have to wait for the assistant manager to give me a ""quote"" on how long it would be.  The wait for the assistant manager was ten minutes.  This is poor training and a bad system.  Why do this at all? The assistant manager ""quoted"" me 30 minute wait time. The actual wait time was 70 minutes.  That's right, SEVENTY.  The location for large groups is in the bar area, not bad, but not great either. The wait for attention, or even drinks, was long, but the wait for entrees, after ordering was nearly 30 minutes.  The entrees did not come out all at once, one was two or three minutes after the others, and this resulted in THE ONLY TIME ANYONE APOLOGIZED.   The server did a sound job of keeping everyone's beverages maintained.    After the entrees were done, it took a very long time to clear and bring the check.  The server began a routine of saying ""I'll be right back with that"" (such as the credit card slip) and returning 10 minutes later.  Very bad training and execution. Cheesecake Factory has good desserts.  We did not attempt them, because we were tired of the endurance-style experience, and did not want to spend more time waiting.  All tolled, we devoted 2.5 hours to dinner for 8 at the Cheesecake factory.  If you have a big party, avoid this place.  They are not set up for it, they have no idea how to do it, the staff and management are apparently not trained for it, and the execution is very poor.   With a smaller party, I have had good service and experience at this place.  With this large party:  Very poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1320

Thea M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,5,,3.0,3/7/2009,"Though it's fun to go to any new restaurant in the first opening weeks, The Cheesecake Factory is a place I'll look forward to return to as the hoo-ha dies down. There were many things going on when seven of us were there recently for dinner, and again when I returned for brunch. Here's a list I hope the owners will read and work on.  1. A seventh person should never be seated in the aisle. 2. The coffee desperately needs to be improved. There's no excuse for bad coffee in the Bay Area! or in any restaurant wishing for return customers. Next time I'll bring my Peets coffee in to make a point. 3. The waiters need to keep closer tabs on their peeps and what they want. 4. Where were the busboys? 5. Several people need to be cruising and watching for empty water glasses, more bread or butter needed, plates that need to be removed, people trying to get a waiter's attention, etc. 6. If dogs aren't allowed on the patio by the summer, all I hoped for in this restaurant will be lost. There should be water available for them, as well. Walnut Creek is a happy community of dog lovers who could easily be accomodated. 7. Last, but probably most importantly ... the wait staff needs to grow up or be older, maybe. They seemed frantic, overwhelmed, and incompetent. A bright smile is not enough, though their courtesy was appreciated. There were so many of them, but half of them seemed to be hanging out and talking about the other half. If there are more than four at a table, maybe teams of two, rather than one poor person trying to manage on their own in the midst of the high energy the place radiates. 8.

Corissa S.,"Oakland, CA",158,43,1,3.0,2/28/2009,"Wow, just what Walnut Creek needs, another trendy chain restaurant. My friends and I thought we would be safe going on a Friday afternoon. Boy were we wrong! The hostess told us it was a 30 minute wait (liar!) and so we decided to stick it out. Off to find the restrooms. This place is enormous, so we were thinking the restrooms would equal the population. Nope. Three stalls for a super huge restaurant, and one wasn't working. I can't repeat most of the comments I heard waiting in that line. Finally, over an hour later, our pager went off and we were seated. From here, we actually had a good time. Our server Brian, was very friendly and didn't mind our attempts at joking with him. He was efficient and funny, always a good combination. You get what you deserve when you decide to go Cheesecake, $10 drinks, $10 apps, and $20 meals. It is a very expensive after work stop. The food is the same at every one, so no need to explain it.  When we left, the wait was over two hours, and there were still 50-60 people totally willing to wait, with their screaming children. More power to them! I think once was quite enough for me. I can now say I have eaten at the former Andronico's restaurant, and feel happy and accomplished, if not with a small feeling of being ripped off for overpriced food and drinks.

First she took our drinks and  the boyfriend and all I ordered for an appetizer was Calamari cause I love me some calamari. Then we waited...and waited. It's understandable if she had to jump in the Pacific Ocean and kill the giant squid and all of it's babies and bring it back to Walnut Creek to batter, fry and over season it to my liking. If that had happened I wouldn't complain. It took FOREVER to get my stinkin appetizer and worse of all SHE DIDN'T BRING US BREAD! I love carbo-loading! We had to ask this other waiter for bread and he couldn't even get the job done bringing us cold bread, how dare he!  By the time our calamari came out I was sooo hungry! When the server had brought it to me, it didn't look appetizing. The calamari was like fried in bundles so when you tore it apart there was still gooey batter intertwined. It did NOT look yummy. There were also many times were several waiters came to our table and brought us food we didn't order and on one occasion that happened one waitress muttered ""I swear this table ordered these"" , really don't be talking shit on your new job!

Ken S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,35,,2.0,7/29/2011,"Went to this place last night since we had a $50 gift card to use. It's an OK place and it seems to be very popular as it was 7:30Pm on a Thursday night and we had to wait for about 10 mins for a table for two. No biggie on the wait. Got a couple of drinks from the bar and sat in their outside waiting area. Got seated in the bar area, which was passable. The decor reminds me of some joint in Las Vegas with the ceiling trying to imitate an Italian palace. The music was too loud and when mixed with all of the noise from the people, it was very annoying - forget about having a conversation without yelling. The server(s) were prompt and brought water and bread right away. The menu is huge - too huge! We finally decided on a spicy ahi tuna roll (fried), steak Diane and a spicy chicken salad. The food was promptly served, but the server could not take our refill drink order and had to find our waiter. He finally showed up and took our order. I wanted a glass of red wine to go with the steak dish BEFORE I finished it. It took at least ten minutes to get two glasses of wine and I had to purposely not eat my dish while waiting for the wine. The steak dish was good with a mushroomy dark sauce, not too overly done (close though!) for being ordered med-rare and there were at least two cups of mashed potatoes piled high on the plate - I think they are proud of their mash potatoes! The chicken salad was good, too, but nothing remarkable. The ahi roll was acceptable, but a little over done. The spicy part of this dish was a mayo-based sauce that seemed to overwhelm the dish with gooeyness. Again, acceptable, but not remarkable. We got out of there for $80 (not counting the $15 for pre-dinner drinks) for one appetizer, two entrees and two glasses of wine with tip. We only had to cough up $30 of our own because of the gift card, so we got good value for our money. We are not fans, however, and will not be making a point of going back. It's too chaotic for us and the food isn't worth the annoyance.

Chris F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,8,,3.0,10/10/2009,"I'm going to assume that majority of the people have heard or know of ""The Cheesecake Factory,"" especially the one located in San Francisco. I would have to start off that they did a great job with the atmosphere and interior design; it definitely caught my attention. Now as for the food, that's an entire different story. Having been to the one in San Francisco, I thought to myself the dishes should taste practically very similar. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. I ordered the ""Chicken Maderia"" which in my eyes, is the safest dish to order since it is definitely well known and highly recommended by others. When the food arrived to the table, it tasted so different that I felt as though I was eating another dish (if that was only the case). I am not stating that the dish wasn't appetizing but I am stating that it was not similar at all. In my honest opinion, if I'm going to spend roughly $20-$25 on a lunch meal (per person), I would definitely want to get what I ordered.  Another issue I had was with the waitress. Now, I can understand during busy hours that a server may have issues in providing the utmost service to their customers, but for my case, it wasn't even busy at all and yet we still received bad service. I had to fetch the waitress for refills and I had to remind the her multiple times about the bread which was not offered to us at all until way later in the meal when the main dishes were already out. After all this, the question is, will I ever come back? In all honesty, I would since it beats driving to San Francisco.

The next time was saw him was 5 minutes later when he dropped bread with no butter and 1 water at our table. WTF? We waited another 15 minutes for our wine to be brought to the table (which arrived after our APPETIZER!!). Additionally, he brought regular wine glasses instead of champagne flutes to the table. Is this guy an idiot or is it just his first day? Regardless, he shouldn't be allowed to serve people when he has no knowledge of anything. He FINALLY took our entree order and then  proceeded to not return to the table until 15 minutes after we had finished our entrees and were waiting for the check. Now mind you, some of this could be understandable if he had a huge section of tables but in reality, this guy had 2 other tables besides ours and that's it. As a waitress myself, I give no excuse for such bad service. When he finally reappeared, my friend asked for the check, a request which he ignored until I finally had to yell at him to grab it. Just terrible overall.  DON'T go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1300

Pasha M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,3,,4.0,1/2/2011,"This was my first time going to the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek. As I stood to the side for my name to be called (so I could be seated) I started reading the Yelp reviews on the place. I noticed that the rating averaged out at ""A-OK"" with actually a lot of concerns/complaints written by the reviewers (the ones I had read at least). I think individual experiences can have a big impact on your impression on a place, but as for me I liked the food and I think the service was good. At this point I would definitely consider going back to take a relative, friend or even a date. Depending on my experience next time, I might have a different view, but I believe I received what I expected from the place, a 3.5-4 star feeling. I have to agree with one of the reviewers about the waiters wearing white and sometimes worn-down dirty white tennis shoes.

We've always been lucky and seated almost immediately. It also helps that I prefer to sit inside, as opposed to patio seating. Not interested in sitting out in the blistering heat in downtown Walnut Creek. Besides the interior of this location is something to behold, seriously, as giant as Grand Central Station. Typical Cheesecake decor, just on a grand scale. They must have sunk mucho dinero into this joint. We have always had prompt service. We always start off with the avocado egg-rolls those are truly addictive. I recently had the fish of the day, which, was a grilled encrusted catfish, I have to say it was fantastic. The spicy cashew chicken is always a good bet. The Kobe burger is one of my faves, and to finish things off, the cookie dough cheesecake can't be beat, or the Godiva cheesecake, or the upside down pineapple cheesecake, or.... take your pick!

These were notes from my Iphone...a little live yelp if you will: Haven't eaten here before and everyone is warning me about the size of the meal. I am already nervous about picking something here to eat.   The restaurant feels very much like vegas, complete with the gold bathed fixtures. Our waiter was nervous and new and used lots of hand gestures. It doesn't seem like he's worked in a restaurant before. I have.  We might start a tally of how many mistakes are made. Our waiter is apparently not our waiter, the old switcheroo.  The menu is super expansive, so much so they brought two menus.  They use their names way too much.  They definitely don't know how to wield their trays yet either. I ordered the cold apple cider, the server brought me my drink and said here's your apple juice.  Sure enough, apple juice. So I tell the waiter hey this is just apple juice, he apologizes, comes back and says apparently cold apple cider is apple juice. The waiter came back just now, couldn't read his handwriting, had to ask us what we ordered again. So we ordered  spinach and cheese dip and received the fried artichoke. The waiter, after bringing our 2nd bread basket, at least noticed it was wrong. So apparently it was the waiters fault. We found out because he told us. Rookie waiter mistake, never admit your fault. Patrons don't like honesty.  A manager came by to sincerely apologize. So one of our entrees were ""stolen"" so we had the pleasure of having a second manager come and apologize.  Took forever to get the new one. So to tally, 4 servers, 2 managers and about a billion apologies with only one comp. End of Live Yelp Here. Food was okay, my companions were happy with it.  I'd go back once the restaurant has had some time to grow into it's britches.  Some of the decorations look like the eye of mordor.  I wasn't pissed about anything, it was just really poor service.  But this happens when these monolithic restaurants open and hire a whole bunch of people who have never served food before.   I'm sure it will become a culinary destination in the future for all the 40 something white people who enjoy watching Celebrity Dance Off and hearing jokes about wine.  But for this Persian boy, I'll only go if it's paid for, my arm is twisted, I am outnumbered, or my girl really wants to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1260
Katie C.,"Sacramento, CA",18,24,3,1.0,3/16/2009,"I'll start off on a positive note: Great job with this new location. Beautiful decor, outdoor seating and fixed the issue with the adjoining parking garage.  Here is the negative.  It's a rare occasion for me to take the time to comment on service I've received but my experience last week at CF has left me appalled and shocked for the time wasted. I've never received such poor service from any restaurant or retail establishment. My first and most likely last experience on Wednesday afternoon for a lunch leaves me wondering how people can actually speak positively about this restaurant.  Went by Wednesday to grab lunch and check out the new restaurant. Waited 30 minutes to be seated (actually told 20 minutes for the wait) which I thought was unusual for a Wednesday afternoon but was willing to wait anyways.  Seated at a great table on the patio along side the fire/water sculpture. We waited 20 minutes, after being seated, before being greeted by our server. In that time we watched 3 other tables who sat down after us order before us. Once our waitress came to us she said, ""Hi."" That was all she said; no other greeting, no apology for the wait but mostly no ""can I take your order?""  She clearly wasn't listening to our order because I had to repeat everything to her THREE TIMES before she had it all down correctly. Once she took down our order she preceded to walk away until we stopped her because she failed to take our drink orders. We waited an additional 15 minutes with no water or bread but noticed our neighbors had received theirs (clearly their waitress was more on top of it). After seeing that and realizing we had just given over an hour of our afternoon to CF without even getting a glass of water we just to decided to get up and leave.  For a large establishment such as CF, I thought they would have invested a gross amount of money on training and operations. In the opening months of a restaurant you would think they would be overstaffed to accommodate the learning curve and hoards of crowds. In an economy as poor as this; which is saturated with over qualified job seekers, I would have expected to receive much better service then what we received at CF the other day. The girl who attempted to serve us was clearly under qualified and unhappy with her job, unfortunately we had to be ones to point that out.  Such a shame since they did a great job re-oing the location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1260

Thankfully, the weather here makes it perfectly ok to sit outside. My boyfriend had white chicken chili and thought it was quite good.

We both saved about half for leftovers (especially after taking a look at the nutritional guide).  We split a piece of the special white chocolate blueberry cheesecake and it was delicious (of course).  The food itself is nothing amazing, but this place is fun, the cheesecake is great, and the service is attentive.

More waiting time for the bread. ( I really dont know why it takes so long to get those things. They weren't even that busy)  4. Finally the food came, but guess what? they messed up our orders...forgot to put the seafood in the pasta, portion sizes were switched.....and the pasta was wayyyy to dry.  5. now we waited another 20 mins for th cheesecake....i really dont know why it took so long. food was just average like any other cheesecake factory.  but the staff are nice..they are just slow",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1240

Leah B.,"Concord, CA",1,3,,2.0,2/24/2011,"Terrible service! We ordered a pasta dish  with ""no mushrooms"" it came back to us with mushrooms, so I politely told the waitress it had mushrooms and sent it back(as they were sautéed with lots of flavor that I don't like). When she returned it I specifically asked if they just scraped the mushrooms out and she said no. I tasted it and sure enough it was still full of the flavor, I pushed around the pasta to find a couple mushrooms they left out! I let her know that they did in-fact scrape it out and pointed out the mushrooms. We were still fully charged for the dish. On top of that mess of a dish, we ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. The potatoes had a 2 hard clumps about the 2-3 inches wide.  How do you send out mashed potatoes hard?! We had to break it up with the fork. Terrible food with bad management!

Do you remember how I said the Chicken Bellagio I ordered at the Stoneridge location was dyed with food coloring and it was coming off? I really liked it otherwise, so I asked them to put the sauce on the side. They brought me two ramekins of sauce, a white sauce and a green ""pesto-like"" sauce. Although... it wasn't pesto. It was basically green oil with melted cheese on the bottom. The whole table wanted to puke! Needless to say, I only used the white sauce. My sister ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, which in my opinion, is probably what falling in love tastes like. It's probably healthier than my Chick Bell, or my other fave, Four Cheese Pasta. Joe Bro ordered a roast chicken that didn't look too great, and Will had a pulled pork sandwich, which he inhaled and said was good. Service was pretty bad--guy kept forgetting things and ignoring us. We basically summed it up as ""he really didn't want to be there"". I understand everyone has bad days, but please don't take it out on us!  Final Verdict: No more Chicken Bellagio for me! I'm only going to order the Pasta Da Vinci!

It seems everyone is attracted to these places, but they're usually nothing more than ordinary.  I always split a meal with someone, not only because the portions are enough but because so many freakin calories in every dish. I wouldn't dare eat a whole cheesecake slice by myself. Having a few bites is really all that's need to fix a craving because they are really rich. The classic strawberry cheesecake is always a favorite.  This location is perfect in downtown Walnut Creek. You don't have to walk more than a block or two from the parking garages which is nice.

The parking is free instead of God knows how much in San Francisco. I've been to this location three times within the first month of its opening and there are still some kinks to work out like the waiters' endless speeches of what's featured. However, my dining experiences have all been very positive. This place is a personal favorite of mine to chill and enjoy the company of the people I'm with and the food. My friends and I come here and we'll sit at our table for hours without feeling rushed or anything like that. There isn't anything on the menu that I didn't like except the jambalaya. If you're curious about it, it doesn't have any tomato sauce and it tastes rather bland. All the appetizers are great. The cheesecakes are all delicious. The last kind I had was the 30th Anniversary and even though that name isn't as descriptive as Kahlua or what have you, it was the best one I've had there. The times that I've eaten here were planned strategically because I know how the waits can be. If you're expecting to get seated right away on the weekends, you really should go to another restaurant.

Way too many other choices nearby......but if you do wait this is where the problem begins.  Just waiting to have your name called you get the feeling of a cattle call.

Becky G.,"Washington, DC",0,16,,3.0,6/30/2011,"So I wouldn't normally bother posting a review for a chain, but there are a few things to note if you visit this home of huge, high calorie servings. First, you can piece together a decent meal of small plates shared with a friend. White bean hummus, firecracker shrimp, lettuce wraps (though PF chang's are better), and fish tacos (it's an entree, but there are 4 and they are easy to share). Second, the mojitos are surprisingly good. I've had my fair share of mojitos and was a bit surprised. Perhaps it helps that my expectations were low. You will need to muddle the mint in the glass yourself to get the right flavor, but after that you are set. Finally, my husband keeps making the mistake if ordering food at restaurants based on concern that our toddler might not like what we ordered for him to share with his older brother. It never works out in his favor. The chicken and biscuits he randomly decided to order tonight were foul. Instead of gravy, it tasted like they were covered in Alfredo sauce.

They should have at least provided a free drink for the long wait yet since their new, it's all about breaking even for now.

This was supposed to be just dinner not  a fu&%#ing  marathon of waiting.  Never do this to yourself, the food I had was orange chicken that tasted nothing like orange chicken it was more like orange chicken jerky it was soo dry. we got served water one time and we learned that if you don't ask for everything at the same time they can't produce.  This place F-ing sucks NEVER GO HERE, TELL YOUR FRIENDS.  i GUESS THEY THINK BECAUSE ITS WALNUT CREEK THEY CAN PULL THIS CRAP.  They didn't dare have a comment card on the table or at the door.  who is running the kitchen anyway. we didn't dare get coffee because they would have had to go to Columbia and get the f-ing beans.  I blame the orgainzation of the kitchen staff, they must have been keebler elves and couldn't reach the pots and pans.  because we ordered cheesecake and icecream and it took 45 more minutes.  realllllllly what is it to do cut the cheesecake put it on a plate and bring it out. Nope wait wait wait.  I just had to do this while it was fresh in my mind.  I have to be to work tomorrow.  But please don't ever go here for a quick meal or any meal save yourself the torture.  I wish I could give no stars and just the big red X to keep you away from this time trap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1360

You can have a very good dining experience here.  There are some very skilled waistaff working in the WC location.  It's not sincere, it's not local, but you could do worse.  The food selection is outrageous.  But then hasn't everyone been to one at least once?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1220

David F.,"Concord, CA",53,375,1603,4.0,1/2/2018,"The Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek is like a little bit of Las Vegas in your home town: gorgeous and glitzy in an over-the-top but attractive way. This is often our destination for special occasions as everyone can find something to eat on their massive menu.  Then you can top it all off with an amazing variety of the best cheesecake you'll ever eat. However, if you are watching your calories, Cheesecake Factory is a challenge! To their credit, they have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu with entrées of 590 calories or less. Unfortunately, the couple times I had tried items from this menu in the past they had been less than inspiring. But on my last visit I found something good: the Skinny Chicken Pot Pie was actually very tasty! It looks a little different from what you might expect as it comes in a soup bowl with a puff pastry floating on the top. But looks are deceiving, and it tasted delicious. If you want cheesecake you pretty much have to accept it's not going to be a great calorie day. The cheesecakes average about 1200 calories, ranging from the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake at 1540 calories to the Low-Carb Cheesecake at 620. The Pumpkin Cheesecake at about 900 was my compromise and quite good. You can also get cheesecakes to-go even if you aren't dining in. Just inside the entrance on the left is a ""cheesecake bar"" where you can order cheesecakes to go, quick and easy. We have done this on several occasions. One minus is that Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, and the wait can be long at busy times.

It was a busy saturday and we were promptly seated within about 10 minutes, which was very surprising and delightful!   Our waitress (Brittany) was pretty nice and attentive and helped us order a heaping amount of food in celebration of our completed finals! I, as usual, ordered the pasta da vinci (ALWAYS a treat) and we split the crab and artichoke dip and chicken samosa appetizers.  I'm usually a fan of the stuffed mushrooms, but I decided to spice it up and try some new ones today.  The dip was fantastic and nice and crabby.  My suggestion is to order it with lemon wedges for squirting on top of your crostinis.  The samosas weren't super amazing though.  A little dry and I wasn't too fond of the dipping sauce so they were a bit dry for me. The pasta was fantastic, as always, and went amazingly with tons and tons and tons of parmesan. Pro tip: order some extra sauce on the side with your da vinci so you can dip buttered bread in it!!!  Honestly my favorite part of the meal!

Most of the time, the minimum wait can be 45 minutes to an hour, but there are times where it can be less than 10 minutes! It just all depends on the time and day. This location is large and spacious, which I love. They also have a nice bar and outdoor seating area. The ladies room is clean and nicely kept. Parking is easy as there are several free parking structures nearby. Staff is friendly, but service can be severly delayed at times. My sister and I was shopping in the area and we were randomly craving some Cheesecake Factory. Luckily, we didn't have to wait long to be seated, but we did have to wait some time before our server was able to check in with us and take our orders. We shared the Crispy Crab Wontons and the Lunch BBQ Chicken Pizza with a Cesar Salad. Food was okay. It's your typical Cheesecake food, nothing spectacular other than portion sizes being generous to share with. We were so full that we ended up passing on cheesecake! Boo. Overall, not a shabby Cheesecake Factory. I do think it's better than the Stoneridge location. Prices (for all Cheesecake Factory locations) are a bit steep in comparison to the quality of the food, but again, portion sizes are generous and not to mention Cheesecake Factory has an extensive menu!

The listed calories on the menu is a mixed bag:  Great to know, but hair-raising when you see the astronomical amounts contained in their meals.   If, however, the high calories really do bother you, no need to worry, cause they've got it covered with their Skinnylicious menu selection with loads of lower calorie options.  I had their skinnylicious chicken pot pie last night and it was wonderful. There is, however, one thing that I have always found perplexing about this restaurant.   For a place  that pumps out one great meal after another, why oh why, are their fries so terrible?  They're at the top of my list for worst fries ever.  In no way, do they compare to the rest of their perfected menu items.   There is often a wait time to get a table and in my experience, it can take quite a while for the food to come out of the kitchen. Last night however, everything went very smoothly and our waiter was outstanding.   I wish I would have taken the trouble to get his name All in all though, it's a great place and if you can't find anything on the menu that appeals to you, you should really just stay home and eat worms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek

Even when you're being the most difficult customer, ordering something difficult, they have always put a smile on. They always remember to bring water and unlimited bread to the table, especially when you run out.  I've ordered many things on the menu and surprisingly, everything has turned out to be good. The mac n' cheese isn't too dry nor too cheesy, the steak has always been been perfect (medium) not too salty, the mashed potatoes are fluffy and tasty. Many things I can comment on, but I suggest you find out for yourself.  One of my favorite spots to grab a quick bite, and/or to have a dinner party for a birthday or event.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek
Robert B.,"San Francisco, CA",492,82,64,4.0,7/12/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory was the first one I've been to in NorCal, specifically in Walnut Creek. There's paid meter parking available right next to the restaurant inside the structure and fairly cheap too. The restaurant itself is very nice, kept clean and organized. One trouble I had was locating the restroom, maybe a little sign would help (if there was one my fault for not seeing it) Our experience was great mainly due to our server Oscar. Although we came pretty late (9pm) he was still as energetic, polite and helpful as ever. Started off with drinks and bread as usual.  We did a basic 3 course meal-- crab dip for appetizer, pasta for entree, and of course, cheesecake for dessert! Personally for me the crab dip tasted a little different, but my date didn't mind it. The pasta was delicious as usual, however I ordered my pasta with chicken. When I got the plate... no chicken. After asking about it one other server (not Oscar) gave me a little attitude on how I didn't order it, which I clearly did lol. After waiting a few minutes we see Oscar rushing through to the kitchen then back to us, then back to the kitchen and back to us a few times to see if I got my chicken. Unfortunately I didn't, but I appreciate his effort and hustle. Fast forward to dessert, the Cheesecake was delish! 'Nuff said.  Overall, you're gonna get either a helpful server or a not so helpful server who's affected by the time period of the day. Was going to give a 3.5 if able to, but I'll just round it up to 4 stars. Oscar was a great guy that gave us a great Cheesecake experience. Hopefully next time we go back we get Oscar, or someone like him!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek

This place is disgusting !!!!!!!! I came here with a couple of my cousins and we were just in shock. The bartender was the only nice person in the building(which is the reason I would rate this place with half a star). The host at the front was VERY RUDE to us!!! I seriously don't know how she got this job when her customer service skills SUCK! You are the face of the company and the very first person people see when they walk in.

We waited till we were long done eating to see our server again to get the bill.  Their cheesecakes are amazing we got vanilla bean and tiramisu. I would recommend both!! I got a lemondrop martini and it was good a little too sweet. My husband got a Long Island iced tea and was a little disappointed with the strength of it.

He was very attentive friendly and on point. Our cocktails were awesome and the food was even more surprisingly awesome. The bill somehow ended up being surprisingly cheap compared to all the food we ordered and the drinks. Not sure what happened there I'll have to ask Greg.

Jessica W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",248,128,266,4.0,3/25/2017,"I've been going to this location for years and it does not change for better or for worse.  Waiting times: Can be excruciatingly long to get a table for dinner, especially since they do not take reservations. Luckily they have a nice outdoor patio for waiting, but if you have a large group, go early or late. Otherwise you can wait for several hours.  Food: Cheesecake Factory is known for their large portions. With large portions comes loads of calories. They do have ""skinny options"" but it's not what they're known for.  Chicken Bellagio- My personal favorite. The basil pesto pasta is always consistent and delicious. It's a bit greasy and creamy from the pesto but nevertheless satisfying. The chicken is a large amount and cooked fully with a crunchy exterior. I love the arugula and prosciutto on top which add texture and freshness. Overall the portion is HUGE and I always expect to have leftovers, which is a good thing.  French Dip- not the best French dip, but definitely a satisfying amount of food. Lots of French fries which is a plus. The bread is nicely toasted and buttered but the meats and filling are not very well balanced and was a bit salty.  Hazelnut Cheesecake- If you love Nutella, you'll love this cheesecake. It's not too heavy or rich like other cheesecakes but will definitely meet any hazelnut cravings.  White Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake- One of my favorites for not being too sweet. My favorite part is the chocolate crust, it's perfection and adds more depth.  Complimentary bread- Always makes a trip to Cheesecake worth for the warm slices of bread and butter.  Overall, cheesecake has huge portions, is very consistent, not a healthy option and may or may not be worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek

Andy L.,"Berkeley, CA",1558,217,1314,4.0,1/13/2017,"Where do you begin with talking about the Cheesecake Factory? I guess with cheesecake... Oh how decadent the cheesecakes are! My favorites are Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Key Lime, Cherry, anything with chocolate and most important, the Banana Cream! Bananananana! On a serious note, looks can be deceiving, as it's strongly represented by 1 burger in particular. Don't get me wrong, I think all their dishes, from pastas to seafood to burgers are all delicious. The problem from that 1 burger I mentioned stems from the meat, Kobe Beef! *IMPORTANT!: it's often assumed that a Kobe Burger will contain actual Kobe Beef. Dead Wrong!  There are 8 restaurant, Correction! 9 restaurants in the U.S. that are certified to serve real Kobe Beef.  Therefore, their Kobe Beef burger is as good as ostrich, if not worse! Of these 9 restaurants, The Cheesecake Factory isn't one of them to make the list. 2 factors that characterize Kobe Beef is the marbled texture which melts in your mouth when you eat it and second, the price which should be reflective to the real cost of $55 dollars an ounce; nowhere in comparison to the $15 dollar burger by The Cheesecake Factory.  I've ordered this item several times reluctantly knowing it's not close to the real thing. Fun fact: Wagyu Beef (or Kobe as we call it in the states) is from pure bred cattle raised on a special diet in Japan. I've witnessed the cattle getting massages and special treatment...with a 'happy ending' of course! The A5 Quality Grade entitles the beef as being the very best; this was more of A1, C1 Grade. Another giveaway to the fake meat was when I asked my most recent waitress where the Kobe came from. She replied by saying she didn't know, as it seems the past waiters didn't know either.  My stomach always enjoys itself at The Cheesecake factory and sometimes, I get so full that there's absolutely no room for dessert, which is essentially the reason I came. The easy fix is to eat dessert first and take home the main course as leftovers.   Another word of advice: do ask how much a drink is if you're all about the mix drinks. I should've known better to ask how much a Long Island was before I actually ordered it. I'm used to my Long Island's being in a Highball, not a Stemless Bourbon Glass in which my Long Island was in. The drink cost me $11.50 and I finished it in only 2 measly sips... 4 Mississippi's  TLDR: long story short, be careful what you order! Kobe Beef is fake at most places! Cheesecake is yummy!  --------------- --------------- Overall experience: 8/10 food, service and ambience Water quality: 8.5/10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=20

How's the food?  Fine. It's the Cheesecake Factory.  Nothing will wow you but everything will please you and you can see by the endless crowds others agree.  It's hard to recall getting the wrong order or things not being cooked properly so it's clear why they are a success wherever they go since that is hard to do so well.  The wine and beer list is long enough and reasonably priced.  It's Cheesecake- they know what they are doing.  But then there's the service.  After a year or so of decent service the older manager must have gotten promoted and things fell back into the old ways.   Ordering take out was good for a while but now the long waits on hold (if they come back) and long waits when you get there are back. When dining in there is the return of the ""not my table"" problem that leads to long waits to place an order.  And then at peak times getting your food can take a long time as well.  Things get worse if your server takes a break midway through service.  At this point this is what we expect and just bake it in to our expectations.  Everyone is very nice so you will never have rude service - that's why they are still A-OK- and why things will probably never improve.  What's the incentive?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=20

We ordered 2 waters and when I finished my water, I noticed that there was water left inside the bottom of the glass even though it was empty. The glass also looked strange. When I realized what this was (after I drank the glass), I was disgusted. It was a glass saucer that was stuck in the bottom with dirty water around it (and in my glass). I immediately asked for a manager and showed it to him. He offered a free slice of cheesecake which is great but still disgusting. How this happens is beyond me but it shouldn't happen.

You've probably been to one a dozen of times (or more) and I've been going to this one ever since it opened up during my high school days. Birthdays, celebrations, girls night out, holiday weekend, family dinner... There seems to always be an occasion to treat yourself to a little ""fancy"" here. I get it, the food is overpriced. I can never deny me their Farfalle Pasta with Chicken and Mushrooms (my all-time favorite dish -- bow tie pasta in creamy garlic, oh it's dangerous!). Though their dishes can come at $15-$25 a plate, they can be tasty. Their salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes is ALWAYS a classic. (They serve up a little something for everyone.) If you're trying to save a little money, their plates are always big portions that are perfect to split with a friend (thank you Mom). You can hardly ever leave here without buying a slice of cheesecake. (Or else you're weird.) I'm a simple girl and go for their classic Fresh Strawberry cheesecake. Every. Darn. TIME. Classic cheesey cheesecake flavor I love topped with luscious strawberries, strawberry sauce and some whipped cream. Take it to go for later if you so please! Their bread for the table is always dangerous. That brown rye bread with some butter... Carb overload! But so yummy! Just think when's the next time you'll come here? Probably in a few months. Maybe even a year. Do it and don't look back. (Taking home your entree was never bad.) The Walnut Creek location has always been a home location for me. The area has significantly gotten more ""upscale"" in recent months, but it fits the area well. Classy, nice ambiance, generally friendly and courteous waiters. Plus, you're in the middle of downtown Walnut Creek, so you can walk off your meal with a bunch of shopping or just lounge out at the movie theater. You can't love TCF, but you can't hate it either. It's got all the goods and ambiance and everything you'd expect from a sit-down eatery (love their outdoor patio for a nice day out). You will be spending a bit much for food that doesn't always wow, but it's an experience here. And I've never had anything really bad to say about them here! P.S. It's almost always dark in all Cheesecake's I've been to. Thus, your photos won't look great.

Sabrina J.,"Fairfield, CA",94,123,652,2.0,11/19/2016,"Let's talk about the worst dining experience for a second....or two.... To begin, I don't understand why The Cheesecake Factory does not allow reservations or call ahead. For a party of about 12 people, we waited 1.5 hours to be seated. Keep in mind, seating in the waiting area is extremely limited. Upon being seated around 8:30PM and ordering drinks, it took at least 10 minutes before our waitress came back with our beverages. It took over an hour for our food to come out and by the time it did, I was not only HANGRY ( hungry/angry), I was equally disappointed. The Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo ($22-$24) was laughable. 3, yes, 3 Shrimp were accompanied by a sliver of a piece of Salmon, it wasn't even 4oz at best. A clump of flavorless mashed potatoes and dry garnish were pretty much the feature of this dish. Our server was horrible! She wasn't very attentive and her overall attitude just wasn't friendly. On several occasions when we attempted to get her attention, we were ignored. Did she offer extra napkins? NO! Did she ask how dinner was? NO! Did she offer anything of value to our overall experience??!!! HECK NO! By 10:20PM, I just wanted to pay my tab and be gone, but of course that took our server forever in a day to do. I get it, it was busy, you may be tired, but if you can't provide decent service, then don't bother coming into work! The Cheesecake Factory is a place that serves virtually EVERYTHING, but doesn't even master at least one thing!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=40
Kanani K.,"Maui County, HI",19,95,134,5.0,6/10/2017,Janelle M is a gem...she had me at hello. No seriously though. We have 2 toddlers and she brought them cut up bread and bananas right after she brought our drinks out because she is awesome and knows kids need distractions so their parents can look thru the pages and pages of food that they offer lol. We love the Cheesecake Factory and had spent the day in San Francisco celebrating our daughter's 1st Birthday. We were tired and wanted to head back to Walnut Creek where our hotel was. We also figured this would be a fun place where they would make her birthday special. They sure did. Service was exceptional. Janelle was a sweetheart from start to finish. The kids even gave her hugs at the end of the night. Great food. Great service. Great memories. Mahalo!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=40

Rae S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,29,79,5.0,10/28/2017,One of the only places with late night eats in Walnut Creek. Arrived at 11:45pm after a concert and was seated right away. Super friendly waitress. My food came out fast and everything was excellent. Not sure what all the bad reviews are about. I've been to Cheesecake Factory countless times. This was my first time at this location but the service was excellent as always. Will definitely go back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=40
Sally A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,5,1.0,9/7/2017,"I've been there at least 5-6 times. Every time it got worse. My one star is mostly based on how the food tastes.  Pros -waiters/waitresses are nice -the place is nice, and also the location is good -menu (just like all cheesecake factories) has a lot of options -cheesecakes are good Cons -everything tastes bad, literally. (except for desserts) Every thing on that menu is bad. Specifically for Walnut Creek location. They really need to start buying fresh ingredients and hire someone who can actually cook! -they don't bring their trade mark bread and butter if they don't want to, you might be sitting there watching other guest getting their bread. And when you ask for one, they don't apologize for forgetting. Makes you feel like you're asking for a favor when it's simply not a favor it's something everybody gets (except for you) -they make you wait to be seated when there are tons of available clean tables. In my opinion it's just to make it seem like people are lining up at their door, but the truth is, it's because they're being lazy, or careless. It is definitely not because the place is packed, because it's never packed, but you always have to wait to be seated. -After they take your order you wait really long time, really really long time, at least half an hour, to receive your non-edible low quality food. First of, how can you fail at guacamole? It's simply avocado and some other veggies. Even their guac was not edible. It tasted horrible. I tried all the pastas, fried bar food, appetizers, main dishes, they all tasted super bad. I rarely leave food on my plate, but at this place I can never finish because it's always tastes bad. It's either super stale, or burnt, or prepared with real bad/cheap ingredients. They overcook the meet and undercook the pasta, then burn the mushrooms, ends up being a horrible dish.  I really liked everything I tried on the menu in the SF location, but in Walnut Creek I never ever left the restaurant happy. I strongly recommend trying the SF location, although the waiting time is always at least an hour to be seated. Still at least the food is edible and it has a view. Where walnut creek, to me it has nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=40

This is honestly my favorite CF, I prefer it over the San Francisco store and even the two CFs down in San Diego where I've been living the last few years. There is always a long wait here on the weekends. Expect about an hour wait. They have gorgeous outdoor seating, bar seating and their normal dining room.  I most recently came here last week with my sister after work, they don't have a happy hour but they do have bar seating with a small plates menu.

The inside is richly decked out in pillars and extravagant murals, all situated nicely under a grand, high-ceiling room.  I ordered the eggplant pasta (I can't recall its exact name) but out of the numerous dishes I've tried here, this is by far one of the better ones. The pasty was rich with the taste of basil and I greatly enjoyed the fried eggplant.  While the server was friendly enough and offered up helpful suggestions, he forgot to bring the sugar twice when my uncle requested it for his iced tea, and he completely forgot to bring out my cousin's order. She was distraught (being 8 years old and saw this as a huge personal crisis in her life) and was miserably eating off everyone else's plate until the server walked by and finally realized he had forgotten an order.

Astrid Z.,"Berkeley, CA",498,617,1529,3.0,3/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my leave favorite places to dine, but I will be unbiased and compare it fairly to other locations. Food: My main reason for not appreciating TCF is due to their HUGE and over the top menu. It's just way too long and I find that because of this, nothing is truly special, nothing stands out to me. I like smaller menus, it makes me feel like they invest more time into crafting these dishes. But I think they succeed with this tactic, because they attract a wider audience since they offer so much. I had the Tortilla Salad with chicken. the Salad was HUGE, like the menu. The ingredients tasted pretty fresh, aside for the beans, which were clearly canned. The chicken wasn't the best in taste, but the portion was definitely fair. I wouldn't get it again, nothing stand-out about it. Price: The portions are big here, for the most part & quality is okay for the price.  Ambiance: Huge restaurant, lots of seating, lots of waiting too. Very clean and can be noisy during dinner and the lunch rush. Service: It wasn't good. Our waiter was not attentive and very forgetful. It was a busy time during dinner, however, I noticed her attending the people around us a lot better than she attended us.

I called in and was placed on hold, no big deal.  After minute 8 of being on hold (I know, I'm an idiot for even waiting that long) I had someone else call to see if they could get through.  While I'm still on hold, the call was picked up and the order was placed.  This was mildly annoying, but whatever...  was told that it would be ready in 25 mins. Arrived to pick up 20 minutes later and paid and waited for the food which was just a burger and fries (yes, I was feeling fancy and decided I wanted a burger from cheesecake).  The wait continued and continued, finally decided to ask if the food was ready or when they expected it to be ready, with no apology or anything the cashier said she would check, walked back to the kitchen and came back with the food.  How long had it been sitting there?  Anyways, 47 minutes after the order was placed (checked the call log) I finally had the food.   The burger was ordered medium and came out well done, like really well done.  It was still good, but not how I wanted it.  The fries were a really small portion.  The bag was filled up about 1/5 of the way.  Luckily they were not cold and they have a good bag for the fries that has holes in it and seems like it was constructed in a way that retains the heat, but also doesn't cause the fries to get soggy.  That actually probably earned the second star on this visit, b/c I've never seen that before and after everything else that had happened, I sort of expected awful soggy fries at that point. The restaurant was not that busy at the time and things didn't seem like they were being run very well.

We usually pick up at curbside, and after the first call of letting them know we've arrived, we wait about 20 minutes before calling a second time. We get an apology, and continue our wait. After 20 additional minutes, we call again. Only this time the hostess says she's sorry, no one notified the bakery after our first two calls. We wait another 10 minutes, and my husband decides to go inside. Food was ready. Restaurant wasn't that busy, it was Wednesday night. Our order was just sitting there at the bakery, cold food now.

Guess what, my meal was cold already when they finally brought my wife's order. I didn't mind it due to being first time here. Today, I decided to give another shot to this location. Hostess who welcomed us took us to a table which was entrance of both door that everybody gets in and out. I asked her that if it would be possible to move us to table just a table away. She replied that there is no server for that table which didn't click on me. How could every table surrounded by that table have server but this doesn't? Anyways after 10 minutes of waiting in the hall she took us to another table which was similar to first one which we refused in the beginning. At that point, I just didn't want to bother anymore and sat wherever she showed us. After 10 more minutes guess what happened? Another couple came in and sat in a table that we wanted, the one that had claimed to have no server, and by the same hostess. This is an outrageous customer experience with no excuses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=60

This is the third time taking home a piece of lemon meringue cheesecake I found the meringue burnt!!! Yes you can remove it but that's one of my favorite parts. We did call this time because our to go order was also missing dressings for the salads. They were kind enough to be sending a gift card to equal our loss. I just hate having to know I can't forget to check my to go orders before leaving for home. Update... we've waited to receive the promised gift card since the 21rst!! I'm pretty sure it doesn't take 12 days to arrive 40 miles away! Husband is on the ph now waiting for a manager again to find out where the promised gift card is.

We were finally seated this time booth was ok with ( only just a little crumbs on the table ( which shouldn't be there at all) but after moving 2 other times I just brushed them off myself I almost felt like I was going to see roaches next!!!!  time to view the menu and order finally    FOOD CHOICE: steak and shrimp scampi Diane and salmon and shrimp scampi Diane & a Greek salad with kale  food had a good flavor but was cold we were going to request our food be hot but I said just forget it I requested my steak well it had a good flavor but was overcoked and too dry the shrimp were very good had a great flavor and cooked in a yummy sauce , honey was not a fan of the salmon but everything else was good too bad the food wasn't hot  SERVICE: considering how dry the rest of the staff was and non welcoming  our server was decent he let us sample a Little wine before making a decision and this is why I like to bring my own wine overpriced basic tasting wine. The server came by a few times just in passing and only asked once how were things nothing special but he was ok not bad and not good!  CONCLUSION: I've been to this establishment in San Francisco which is always packed which is why I came here and the ambience and service was so much better had no problems Cheesecake Factory is a popular in my Opinion casual place to dine but I'm sorry this location was horrible it looks nice on the outside and inside but is poorly maintained each section we went to was dirty staff looks very bored and Unintrested I'm glad this was just a casual date night and not a special Ocassion or I would have been very upset and probably would have informed the manger but hey that's what Yelp is for and by the way whoever the manger is clearly does not care or is not attentive to the restaurant he is managing these standards are unexceptable especially for this place I don't recommend this location you'll probably be disappointed or leave with bread crumbs or a bug in your bag I'll never return to this location!

KellyAnn J.,"Guerneville, CA",64,120,215,1.0,7/15/2016,"I finally made it to a Cheesecake Factory. Since I am a big fan of anything cheesecake I was excited. Maybe my expectations were high. Maybe I make a better cheesecake than I realized. But, it was less than mediocre IMHO.  I stopped in alone as I needed a break to go over some paperwork and wanted a cool place to rest in between my busy plans. It was a beautiful, huge place with a grand entrance and spectacular decor. That is where the greatness stopped.  I waited too long before my server came to my table. I ordered a slice of chocolate mousse cheesecake after telling my server I was excited about being here for my very first time. There were no suggestions from him, and he brought it back relatively quick.  It seemed too old to me. The Oreo like  crust was bitter and a bit slimey on the bottom. The mousse too was flat, loose and seemed like it wasn't made anytime recently. The cheesecake part was good in the middle but the chocolate shavings on the top were few and once again, kinda slimey -ewww.  I pushed the slice around with my fork, trying bites here and there and became more unhappy with each bite. By the time I was done I disassembled it to eat only the middle. The edges tasted wrong. And the crust was awful.  When my server finally showed back up to ask how it was, I had been pushing it around my plate for far too long. I then explained my opinion in a very polite way. He understood that I did not like it at all, and in fact I thought it was stale or old. He then suggested I try his favorite: the ""tuxedo"" next time and described it. Now he makes a suggestion? A bit late for me... I felt slighted about my old slice.  He then took my plate, as I wasn't eating any more of it, and took awhile to bring me my tab and then surprisingly disappeared for another 12 minutes ( I counted because I wanted to leave, but needed change) I had a $20 waiting for that tab, but he dropped it and ran away before I could slip it inside. That 12 minutes wait (too long)left me thinking he maybe was going to bring me a fresher piece of cheesecake. But NO, just the tab. So I left a dollar tip and was sorry I had come to the Cheesecake Factory. Note: my visit was on Thursday afternoon, July 14th between 4-5pm. The place had very few customers at that hour. There seemed to be lots of employees. So I see no reason for such poor service.

My wife asked to sit outside to avoid the insane wait. We were seated In 5 min, relatively far from the heater with many closer seats available. My wife posed the question to me why we didn't get seated nearer to the heater.  As they sat  all the middle aged Caucasian couples right beneath the heater, it became clear that they sat us further because we were a 20 something couple of color and they wanted better tips. It's offensive, to say the least. We would have tipped very well having both worked in food service previously, but they will be lucky if I willingly tip anything after being pushed into the cold by their lack of regard for everyone. I bet if we weren't darker skinned and young, we'd have gotten better seats. It's shameful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=120

I've driven from Florida to Denver and back and tried different ones and yes this is the worst!  Let's start by saying the wait was longer than usual almost 3 hours tonight! And we get a server who pretty much was absent from our table all night!  It was only four of us at the table and we didn't get water, bread and a menu until 10 minutes after sitting down.  Once we did get our bread we ordered right away seeing how none of us had eaten all day due to busy schedules. I ordered a To Go Meal and specifically asked for a pasta dish with no meat! I told the waiter 4 times and stressed to him that my girlfriend was a Vegetarian!!!!!!!  After waiting over an hour the server comes back and says and I quote ""sorry about the delay our kitchen is swamped and they haven't got to your order yet but here's the TO GO meal""  I couldn't believe it! The to go meal was ready but our actual food for the table wasn't? Absurd! but wait there's more ..  35 minutes goes by and only 2 plates come out! Not all four but 2 ... now this is all after waiting almost 4 hours in total! And it's not even the worst part!  I get home cross the bridge and the pasta dish for my Vegetarian Girflirend had nothing but MEAT in it!!! I lost my top! I called and spoke with the manager Jason Shum and his way to solve the problem was a gift card and a sorry!!?!?! After my girlfriend is throwing up sick after eating this nasty poor excuse of meal the best he had for me is a gift card and a sorry??????  No this is way unacceptable and I'll be sending my check order my complaint and a lawyer if need be to the corporates office!

Brenda N.,"Danville, CA",0,14,2,1.0,8/7/2017,"We are a family of three (with young child) and Sunday night was a very frustrating dinner experience for us. We arrived at 6:50pm and waited 40 minutes to get seated (around 7:30pm). We placed our order immediately (as we've already waited so long to get seated) and were hoping to finally enjoy a relaxing dinner, BUT... 1) Our Pasta Da Vinci was missing chicken (we did not ask for vegetarian option, btw) and had to be sent back to be remade.  2) This is minor: Our coconut-lime green curry with chicken had rice that was dry and clumpy, which makes me suspect that it was day-old rice.  3) We placed our child's ice-cream order (along with our main dishes) at 7:30pm and by the time we were ready for dessert (before 9:00pm), they said they were out of chocolate ice-cream and only had vanilla. When we asked if we could have some chocolate syrup as a compromise, our server said OK then when the bill came, it showed up as $7.95 as opposed to the expected $2.95 for ice-cream. If we were going to be charged $5 extra for syrup, we need to be informed!!! The ice-cream did not arrive yet so we were able to refuse it and get it taken off our bill, but that took 10-15 minutes. 4) By now, we just want to get out of there. We got the corrected bill, and my husband gave the server a gift card and a credit card to cover any outstanding balance. It turns out that our gift card had enough to cover the entire meal with $4 leftover. Instead, the server swiped the gift card until the balance was down to zero and then charged our credit card another $10. Good thing we checked our gift card history and saw this. We approached the manager and he fixed it, but this was another 30 minutes of extra wait time. No apologies were given. Needless to say, by the time we were done with this nightmare, it was 9:40pm and my child was sleeping on my lap. It was a horrible 3-hour dinner experience with multiple attempts at deception.

We talked to a manager and got a discount and free cheesecake luckily. An AMAZING SERVER named Jackie took over and took care of anything.

Tom P.,"Vallejo, CA",11,28,,1.0,10/25/2016,"What a disappointment! After years, decades, even, of hearing the hype, and that one celebrity who swears by it, I found it to be on the low end of Mediocre. We got there at opening time on a Thursday. The staff seemed sad to see us walk in. The drinks server was good, no problem there.  As we waited, we had opportunity to observe the staff in action. There was a lot of yelling across the open space amonst the servers. Not sure what it was about, but they seemed oblivious to the presence of customers. At one point, a server passing by our table shouted so loudly that I got an Adrenalin rush, right down to the tingly fingers. And I'm not that easily rattled. It was as though we did not exist in her world.  Add to this the hard environment -- tile floor, faux marble columns, etc. -- couple with the oppressive, even assaultive loud music, and the noise level was such as to dampen the taste buds. Also, for heaven's sake, CF, have a word with yourself: that's the most obnoxious mix of music I've ever heard in a restaurant. There is plenty of non-aggressive music in the world. Another comment regarding staff: Management needs to direct staff to forego perfume, especially cheap aftershave. Apart from the fact that many people are sensitive to such chemicals, the taste of them on the tongue detracts from the food. Okay, that covers service, atmosphere, noise, and offensive odors. On to the food! I had the Vietnamese spring/summer rolls. They were built well, with apparently fresh ingredients, and I liked the dipping sauces, especially the hot chili one. But they were permeated with a a stale refrigerator smell and taste.  The Baja fish tacos would have been acceptable, except they were served lukewarm. The black beans were lukewarm and bland. The rice was lukewarm and tasteless. Possibly left over rice from the previous day? Hard to tell, but I wouldn't be surprised. The original cheesecake was way below mediocre. I've had better from a frozen box.  I see that management's response to other comments runs along the lines of ""Why didn't you discuss this with your manager?"" Good question, why didn't I? Because it's not a problem with a single meal, or a bad day. Obviously, the place is operating as designed, and the staff is operating as trained. I didn't care to have an unpleasant conversation to state the obvious. Why do you need to be told, CF, that loud, smelly, overblown environment combined with sub-mediocre lukewarm food is not acceptable. Stop blaming customers, get your act together. And don't you think that 80 bucks for lunch for two is insanely over the top? That's 1 beer, 1 cocktail, 1 entree, 1 appetizer, 1 slice of cheesecake. 80 bucks. Eighty. Bucks. That's before tip, and doesn't count the nearly impossible-to-find parking, or the bridge toll.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=120
Wendy S.,"Portland, OR",43,5,3,1.0,8/8/2017,"Sorry to say... there were several disappointments at the factory today... The service was extremely slow... the French dip was burnt to a crisp and when I mentioned it to our server... she said oh ok... didn't offer to replace it... or offer something else... then we ordered dessert... 30 minutes and still waiting for our dessert... I asked the hostess to Check on our dessert... and he goes and wipes a table... and then comes back by and says.. ""I'll find your server.... "". We're standing here to pay... she brings the melted ice cream... and says do you want this... ahhh no.... the part I don't understand is that the restaurant is not busy... are they short handed??  What gives....interesting enough as  still standing here waiting for our check... the server tried to blame the bakery for their slowness... its was not the bakery's fault... Now that I am home and had a chance to reflect on our service, I'm still frustrated and disappointed.  I think what bothers me the most... was not the burnt French dip, or the 30 plus minute wait for our dessert, or the lack of check back by our server, but how the server tried to blame the bakery for the delay in getting our desserts out... which was not the case as we watched the ice cream melt while waiting for our check at the counter... however the most frustrating part of the meal, was how the manager handled my concerns... maybe he was having a bad day.... maybe his cherries spilled... who knows... but his utmost lack of customer service was absolutely shocking... his comment to me in regards to the burnt French dip was "" well the server showed me .., and you did eat half of it..."". Well yes I did eat half of it as the server did not return to check on us.... my reply to the manager was"" YOU saw the quality of food your kitchen sent out..., and you didn't immediately to something to rectify the situation?.,,"".

Maggie F.,"Vallejo, CA",11,25,25,5.0,5/16/2016,"I'd like to think my boyfriend & I frequent here quite a bit & for many reasons. To start off, the seating usually isn't too bad as long as you're not in a rush. They're a very popular place so don't expect to be seated immediately in the middle of a dinner rush or a weekend evening. They take your name down & give you a buzzer to let you know when your table is available with plenty of seating to wait & you could even wait outside without missing your chance to be seated. You can also grab a drink at the bar! The interior is beautiful! Very high ceilings, awesome lighting depending on the mood of you & your guests. Plenty of seating both inside & outside, we've eaten at both places there's a fire pit & heaters outside if you end up out there. The menu itself has PLENTY of options no matter what your preference may be. I'm personally a huge fan of the Chicken Madeira & their pasta is also good. You're also served bread & butter when you're seated. As far as drinks go, the menu is just as extensive. The Asian pear martini is my favorite, introduced to me by my boyfriend & I'm never disappointed! I've always received good service here & that just about rounds out the reasons I come here so often.

Veronica S.,"Patterson, CA",0,47,45,2.0,4/13/2017,"Bad service terrible server Lissette. So listen up Lissette (Idk how to spell your name, my apology)! First of all we get seated to a handicap booth; my friend who's not as skinny as me gives me the eye of this is so embarrassing because she's a bigger girl. So I told them there is a lot of other open boothes, I know you not gunna try to squeeze us in this booth. So they agreed to give us a normal size booth. We where seated and asked for drinks from our waitress Lisette who grabbed them in a good amount of time. Now she gave our drinks to us backwards and I said politely oh here it's like this no worries. She then disappeared we did not see our waitress Lisette for quite sometime,maybe 15 mins to take our order. So I got up to the station of the cashier little booth by the bar and asked for her. Weird enough she was in the little booth behind a gentleman who was working there. So it took her 5 mins more which was a while granted because we where the boothes closest to the bar. So I gave her my order that she didn't apologize for the 20 min wait or even show one sign of sympathy or even a smile. I told her my order and she didn't write it down or acknowledge me if that was it, just super awkward. Then off like a flash she ran away kinda like a mean girl that she didn't want to talk to us lower class subjects haha. My friend who has worked as a manager for restaurant told me how sad they didn't give her enough trainer and how she didn't look like she even taken care of her self.Like she should  fixed her pony tail and maybe someone should tell her to lay off the blush but I'm not here to poke at her image god knows I had no makeup on with ugg slippers lol but No excuse for Lisenette she is at her job so let the record show : you should present yourself at work a bit higher on the spectrum. So she disappeared for all of the meal and I had to call over the manager tell him about my situation and on top of that I had a really bad bent butter knife as well. After that the meal came after waiting a hour for fish tacos and a turkey sandwich ; didn't help that the server that wasn't even our server spilled my friends fries all over the floor! I felt bad for the guy but it's like another yet embarrassing thing to happen to us. The manager did take care of our desert which was fabulous but he should train his staff better. Oh that's right what happen to Lisnette or Lisette, she never showed her face not even once! Disappointed and I left no tip to my ghost server. So Lisette or linsette I will discuss what you need to work on help you out because I was a cocktail waitress back in the day!  1. Smile  2. Be friendly and usually have a opening Example: Hello good after noon how are we doing today? Good me to! 3. If you mess up or are late with you customers Say: I apologize for the inconvenience I'm very busy and let me get started for you on your order or if the customers food is late go over say ""hi can I refill your drinks?""  4.Don't let your customer ever wait always check on them! Update on food is always so helpful!! 5. Ask them if there's anything else they can do after serving your food! 6. Check on them while they are eating  7. Tie it together at the end with desert and the bill 8.Appearance this is kinda like judging a book by the cover.Sounds bad but hey it's the truth. If you look like a hot mess people tend to not want that person serving food thinking maybe a loose hair will find a way in your food or the girl with too much makeup is distracting to look at. Always have a tight clean pony tail and natural makeup on it shows the customer you take care of your self and reassures their food will be handle with care with no hairs in it. Your tip should be excellent! I may look like a 14 year old little girl but I'm that undercover boss that will tip you $20 to $50 usually that's lunch tips for 2 girls haha image dinner tip! I had to tip 0 never in a very long time has this happened. So I hope this was helpful to the worst server Lisette or linsette.

Talilah D.,"El Cerrito, CA",189,7,,1.0,10/19/2017,"Today I was so saddened by my experience at the cheesecake factory. I have been to this particular location many of times with small groups and large groups and never had the experience I had today. I came all the way from El Cerrito just for my favorite item the kale salad. To my surprise they no longer offer the salad. Instead I got a beet goat cheese salad. I tried to eat but the combination of the bitter arugula mixed with the beets that taste semi dirty I just couldn't take. Instead of the manager offering compensation for the bad salad or offering apologies  instead he came across as condescending and rude. I ordered my second dish which were the Tex-Mex egg rolls they were dripping in oil and covered my hand. When I mentioned it to my server she said ""that's how all of our fried foods are""...I question her because I've had food here before that was fried and never had it cover my hands with oil.  She responded by being rude and not saying anything...she just looked at me with a strange look on her face. I told her i eould just order a cheesecake to go. I sat an additional 10 minutes or so as she walked all around me making sure every other  customer had what they needed. She finally came for my cheesecake order but I was over it.  I was certainly ignored by the manager as well as the wait staff. Disppointed in poor service.

The Walnut Creek branch, however, has slowly slumped their level of excellence.  The superb service that I personally raved about amongst all the Cheesecake Factory properties is fading away.  Walnut Creek is unfortunately falling victim to a growing company.  Unlike other branches like San Francisco which have managed to keep their game strong, there is now the sensation that they letting things slip through the cracks.  In the past, they clearly only employed the upper-crust of good people.  This is no longer the case.  It seems to me that management needs to tighten up the hatches; then they will rise up to the level of superiority we've grown to expect from them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=140

Then we waited 5 more minutes till finally a server came up to us and told are drinks and food would be right out. As we sit and wait the salad that was ordered first never came. As the food was delivered the salad came with our entrée. Was kind of perplexed on how the service was. I have been in to this place multiple times and never had the type of serve that was given today, or should I say lack of service.

I got seated outdoors around this huge square fountain they have in the center of the outdoor seating. it was a little chilly but it was a super nice day in walnut creek.  I ordered something super original, spaghetti with meatballs. but it was delicious, probably one of the best plates I've had. I had a Hershey chocolate cheesecake for desert and it was phenomenal. I couldn't finish because I was so stuffed but I took it home for later ;)  overall our service was good, our waitress was attentive to us considering it was a full house. I do think it's weird how cheesecake doesn't take reservations so whenever you come here anticipate a wait. the last time I attempts to eat here I didn't because the wait was 2+ hours.

I left more than 3/4 of it there. So all the good stuff, (beans, chicken, tortilla) were kind of buried under this huge quantity of ""filler"". It was a turn off to see when it arrived in it's 12"" bowl. If I had been heading home after lunch I would have asked for the leftovers to go but would have had to add protein later, of course.

Jazzmine N.,"Oakland, CA",0,13,1,2.0,3/6/2017,"I walked on a Monday afternoon around 1PM. I was told that I would have to wait 15 minutes for a table of two. That was fine with me and joined the others that where waiting for their tables. What was beyond me was that there where plenty of tables open. Maybe they can only seat as many people as workers they have during the weekday? After I was seated our server came by within minutes. Asked us for drinks and if we were ready to order. Everything was fine up to this point.  After waiting 30 minutes our server walked by and noticed that we did not have our food. She informed us that it would just be a few more minutes. We talked amongst ourselves for about 20 more minutes. Then finally a gentleman holding one plate comes to our table without saying a word points at our food indicating where should he place the plate. He never said anything else or even smiled. He did not even recall what the dish he placed was or said anything about the other dish. He walked away with a smug face. Okay dude, what's your problem. He comes five minutes later with my food, and you know the jelly like film sauces get when it sits out because of the oil. Yeah I had that. My food was not hot or warm. It was room temperature. They did not even care enough to clean the plates as I saw sauce and butter around the edges. My boyfriends burger was slightly warm as well. He ordered a burger with mac & cheese. The mac & cheese ball was placed in the center. I guess they cut the center of the beef patty and replace it with the mac and cheese. It was hard to find someone to ask for condiments and it was hard to find my server as she only came to our table about 3 times. (To order, to tell us our food is coming, and for the check)  The food was not outstanding. It's as generic as food can get. They list the calories on the menu. I'm wondering all the calories go to. The protein to starch ratio is beyond me. They put a huge portion of mashed potato with a small piece of protein and whole bunch of buttery oily sauce. & the fries are hard and not even warm!  The ambiance is nice, I guess. That's what I give the stars for. The cheesecake is alright. For the price, people do not deserve microwaved food (basically).

Anyways he explained a couple of specials that they were having and recommended the fish. He then got our drink orders and came back maybe 5 minutes with the drinks and bread basket.  Then we sat for the next 15 minutes waiting for him to come back to take our order, but sat there instead as he took another tables order who was seated after us. Another server came up to our table with out any introduction and asked if we were ready and finally took our orders.  We sat for another 25 minutes for our appetizer to come out (by the way we ordered spinach and cheese dip... Nothing too complicated). As we began to eat the chips and dip a man in a dress shirt approached our table which was by far the most awkward interaction i have ever had at a restaurant with the restaurants manager... He began to apologize for how slow the appetizer came out and said ""it normally doesnt take this long and i do apologize for the wait but we had to make it from scratch which is why it took longer than normal...""  On a side note i know this probably sounds very petty but i ordered a factory burrito with no onions and when the server dropped off the food he even said heres the burrito with no onions.... And with the first bite i tasted and saw a bunch of onions fall out of the burrito.  After a few minutes the server came back and asked if we had spoken to the manager and if he took care of us which i replied ""well he said hi and apologized"" and the server responded with ill speak with him and make sure he'll take care of you guys.

Jonathan Y.,"Union City, CA",296,29,271,1.0,2/18/2016,"My friend and I have a little joke about this place where we consider it a five star restaurant (her friend truly thought this place was a five star restaurant and we called it this for over a year. Their ambiance isn't too shabby and people dress... Kind of nice I guess.). We had a good amount of respect for this place, coming here maybe once every month or so. This experience was by far the worst experience I've ever had here.  Wait time: We put our name down and they said it would be about an hour to an hour and a half wait. So we waited. And waited. And waited. A little less than two hours went by and still nothing. We stood by where they called the names so it's not like we didn't hear them. I asked them about our table only to be told they called our name already. Then they said that we would get the next available table. They called several other two party names but still didn't say our name. It's not like they mispronounced it... It's Jon. How hard can that be. So about thirty more minutes went by before I asked them again what the status of our table was. They replied by telling me that they had already called our name and seated us. Food: I ordered the chicken Marsala and substituted the pasta for a salad. It wasn't bad but it seems like it was done cooking and sitting out from the looks of it. There was a film already formed on the sauce. As for the salad, it was extremely bland. If you like a Caesar salad with a tiny big of sauce, over fried croutons, and browning lettuce then this is perfect for you. On a positive note, the fried macaroni was good. Only problem was that they skimped out on the sauce this time. They usually have more. Either way I do recommend it.  Service: The service was extremely unresponsive. They didn't do anything to make up for what they did. I think because it wasn't our waitresses fault, she felt like it wasn't her problem. She even decided to disappear for 10 minutes and this was when we were finished eating too.   Overall I would have to say that this experience was just disappointing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=200

However we finally had a bad experience there. Our waiter, Joel, was extremely rude and just overall an awful waiter. He never introduced himself to us, just said ""Do you want any drinks"", To which we ordered our drinks and appetizer. We waited almost 20 minutes after our appetizer had arrived to even order our entrees. I had my hand on the menus sitting on the table, getting ready to hand them to Joel, but he grabbed them out of my hand off the table before the conversation was even over. We tried brushing it off as if maybe he was just having a bad day and it would just blow over.. Everyone has bad days, we get it. At one of the 3 times he stopped at the table (during the whole 2 hour experience) and let out a huge sigh as if he was exhausted serving us, which he barely did anyways.

Our order did not come out after 20min.

I ate about a quarter, mostly because I was starving, but it tasted slightly undercooked, and really greasy. Again, not a fan. To top it all off, I had ordered a slice of cheesecake with strawberries to go. And it ended up being disgusting. The strawberries tasted unbearably artificial, and the cheesecake was subpar.

My last two experiences were almost identical and well below that of other locations.  The menu is great and there's usually something for everyone. The food quality is also good, it's getting it that's the problem. On my last two visits with a small group - 4 - there was 20-25 minute delay between the first person's entrée arriving and the last person's, such that everyone was finished by the time his food came out. They also forgot to bring out the appetizers and gave us frozen cheesecake to finish.  I get that things like this happen, it was unfortunate that it happened to us on two visits in a row, but what really was disappointing was the manager's attitude.  He came to our table he said that the particular cheesecake was a favorite and so they didn't have time to defrost it....... Then when we mentioned the delay in bringing the food out and that some people had already finished before others got their food, his responses was ""Well, what do you expect? Do you see how busy we are?"" What do I expect? I expect you to only seat the number of patrons that you can actually serve.

Carol C.,"Alameda, CA",198,884,6324,4.0,11/25/2014,"My girlfriend picked me from the Walnut Creek BART Station to dine on late lunch at this Cheesecake Factory. We were both celebrating our birthdays - mine is tomorrow (November 26) and her birthday is on November 28. My friend and I don't often get together for birthday lunches, so we decided to make it a tradition to dine at different restaurants in the future. As usual, we were somewhat undecided as to what we wanted for late lunch. The menu is extensive, making it a difficult decision to hone in on what we felt like eating. The waitress, Jenna, gave us ample time to decide. She was attentive in filling our water glasses, and occasionally checked to see if we enjoying our meals. We started with appetizers - mini crab cake bites and sweet tamale corn cakes. Both apps were delish, but I wished they serve more than 1/2 dozen of those crunchy seafood delight. I probably could have eaten a dozen of them. My girlfriend never had the sweet tamale corn cakes, which is one of my favorite apps. We agreed not to have any pasta dishes as entrees - more carbs - even though chicken fettuccini is a tempting dish. I should have went with the salmon Genovese, which my girlfriend had. She enjoyed it very much. I decided on the shepherd's pie. The dish was a tad too salty for me, so I only ate about half of it (3 stars). The waitstaff came with our ""birthday"" cheesecakes - slice of pumpkin for my friend and a slice of mango key lime for me...oh yum (4 stars).  Service was a little slow, but that's okay. It gave us time to digest the food and relax for a few hours. The drawback: street parking can be difficult. There is a public garage about two blocks away.  I like this Cheesecake Factory better than the one in Macy's Union Square (SF) because it is less crowded during the weekdays, less tourists and more spacious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=220
Rachel T.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,4,1,1.0,8/20/2017,"Came here as a party of 7 during the time they had the half off cheesecakes. We all decided to just get cheesecakes since most of us had eaten before. When we were seated it took 10 minutes for our server to show up and greet us. We ordered 5 cheesecakes total. The server left and didn't check up on us for the longest time, as we watched her tend to tables beside us instead. I really don't care if we just ordered cheesecakes, that doesn't give a server the right to ignore us, we're still paying customers! In fact, that was probably the easiest order she had during that time! We were very polite to her and after an hour past with no drink refills or any updates on the status of the cheesecakes, one of us had to go up to her and ask what was going on. Then she proceeded to say that the cheesecake area was backed up and would take 25-30 minutes. But she wasn't specific if it were 25-30 minutes after we initially ordered or from when one of us went up to her to ask. We waited another 30 minutes with nothing and she did not come to us to see if we were okay. She only came to our table 3 times the entire time we were there. I don't believe it was backed up as bad as she said because the table next to us when we decided to just leave had bagged up cheesecakes with them which I know they ordered after we did. Plus, if they were doing orders in a first in first out manner, that shouldn't have been a problem. It seemed like she didn't even go over to the cheesecake area to check on our order and was just hoping the employees in that area would bring it to us. I know restaurants are hectic and I understand that was a busy day for the cheesecake area in general and things can go wrong, but to get no update or apology from the staff before we even ask for info is not cool at all. The server should have known that seeing us sitting there with no cheesecakes after an hour would make her want to come up to us herself and apologize and make it right in any way she could. But instead she chose to ignore us and tend to tables by us right in front of our eyes and did not apologize until one of us had to get up and talk to her to get her attention. We felt ignored, for sure. So, to spend almost 2 hours just sitting there and having a waitress barely come to us with updates or an apology, I had a terrible experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=220

Then when she finally came back with the bill she still didn't apologize and told me ""Well next time you don't like something you need to let me know ahead of time.""  Well excuse me how could I possibly let you know anything when you hardly attended to me?? She then told me ""I could give you a free cheesecake but I'm not going to do anything about the meal"" she the proceeded about her business.  She had seen our check was ready to be settled but proceeded to attend another table and take their orders. So I went to the host stand and asked if she could give the manage my tab and she then told me ""No I can not I can grab your server but if you just go wait that's faster."" Then thankfully a server named Tyler came and had great service for the 3 minutes he attended to me. He settled my tab and got me a free cheesecake.  My server Cecelia and her service was very horrible.... Very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=180

My child doesn't cry when out to eat but gets very excited for food and will make a loud yell to let you know he wants food (he is 10 months old). Some of the older customers had issues with this and told us to take our meal to go. I could have sworn this was a family friendly establishment.

Had high hopes for the Walnut Creek store but seems they share the same philosophy of mediocrity. Right from the start they mucked it up. The first appetizer we requested was the fire cracker salmon rolls but they sent it with no sauce. We asked for the sauce and were told they were probably out but looking. Sorry, why send it to the table then?!!!  I had to ask for it to be removed from the bill.  Then my wife's entree arrived incorrectly. She ordered the shrimp scampi with steak Diane. They brought steak Diane with salmon. The time it took to get the correct dish meant mine was cold by the time it came it out.  The waiter is a nice guy but the same dirty plates sat on the edge of the table after at least 6 or 7 visits by him. He took some but not these. Inconsistent.  Congratulations Cheesecake.

Iona C.,"Orinda, CA",491,374,1909,3.0,6/16/2014,"One of my two younger brothers just LOVES The Cheesecake Factory (TCF).  Yes, I know, his taste is absolutely questionable. Just kidding.   I think I can KINDA get why he likes it so much.  We came here yesterday afternoon to celebrate his birthday.  There were a lot of people waiting outside (apparently a lot of fathers love this place, too - belated Happy Father's Day to all you fathers and father-figures), and we were quoted a 40 minute wait time.  They give you the option of choosing between indoor seating, outdoor seating or first available.  I didn't eat breakfast that morning so I went with option numero tres.  Instead of giving me one of the usual restaurant pagers that lights up and vibrates, the host asked for my name and cell phone number.  Afterward, he printed out a small slip of paper that had my aunt's name (misspelled - 'C' not 'S,' dear), the time we put our name on the waiting list, our estimated wait time, and a time that we should be nearby. I personally love this system.  When we went here last September they didn't have this, but I think it now makes it easier to wander off to a local shop instead of just milling right outside the restaurant because you're afraid to step outside the radius in which your pager can still function. We ended up receiving a text telling us that our table was ready at 2:16, 13 minutes before the suggested time for us to be nearby, and only 22 minutes of waiting.  Awesome! We ended up getting a table outside which was perfectly fine since it was nice and warm.  Our waiter, Jose, got us our drinks, took our orders, and got us bread and butter in no time at all.  Here's what we got (and some notes): Birthday Brother -  *Coke - 2.95 ^ BBro said it tasted like the diet version so we asked a passing waitress for a new one.   Still tasted like diet, so we had our original waiter bring out Root Beer instead.  Don't quite know what's up with that. *Fried Mac & Cheese appetizer - 9.95 ^ I thought this sounded gross, but it was actually pretty good.  When will I learn that fried makes everything better? *Grilled Fresh Salmon - 19.50 ^ Served w/ broccoli garnish and mashed potatoes.  Sizeable portions. * Red Velvet Cheesecake - 7.95 ^ BBro only ate half, but said it was good. Other Brother (lol, sorry) -  *Buffalo Burger w/ Fries - 11.95 ^ They made a mistake since he actually asked for a salad.  Oh well.  Older sibs love fries so it's ultimately a lose (for him), but win for me and the other bro. *Reese's PB Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - 7.95 ^ Littlest bro is a pretty healthy eater and took two bites of this.  Methinks the older bro advised him to order it for himself... Aunt C. -  *Mojito - 11 ^ Not overwhelmingly minty.  Decent. *Skinny Hamburger - 9.95 ^ Comes with a salad in a vinaigrette + thinner buns and no butter.  I think they should just call it a ""Sad"" Hamburger at this point. *Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake - 7.50 ^ Auntie loved it and finished it in one go! Mom (To Go) -  *Mango Keylime Cheesecake - 7.50 ^ Mom loved it! Me -  *Kobe Burger w/ Fries - 13.95 ^ Didn't really taste a big difference in the meat... I guess I'm not classy enough to appreciate it.  Whatevs. *Godiva Cheesecake - 7.95 ^ I'm a total chocoholic, but even I have to eat this in stages.  So rich! All in all, you could go elsewhere for burgers (Fudds), sandwiches (Ike's), pizza (California Pizza Kitchen), and everything else on their menu... but their cheesecakes...  Yup.  Make this the extra dessert spot on your list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=260

It's a nice atmosphere and our meals were good. Pasta carbonara was very good as usual for Cheesecake Factory, but hubby tried the catfish plate and it was the best fried catfish I've ever had. The Caesar salad needed more dressing but I didn't need the calories so all good. The parm wasn't as flavorful, and my hot water for tea wasn't as hot as it could have been prepared --hence the 4 stars for the meal.

S S.,"Concord, CA",2,12,3,3.0,3/7/2017,This place used to be my favorite restaurant ever. Me and my husband used to always go here and get the same plate every time which is the spicy chicken chipotle pasta & lousiana pasta and they used to make it very delicious but lately the pastas suck. idk if it's becuz they have new chiefs in the kitchen or what's going on. Was there a week ago and the pasta wasn't even spicy like it should've been and both plates were sauceless and dry as hell.  When we asked for extra sauce due to how dry the pasta was it took them another 10 minutes and by the time the waiter bought the sauce the pastas were completely cold. come on cheesecake factory what happened to those delicious pastas ???,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=260

The calamari was taste-less and the plate was full of deep fried batter crumbs.  I ordered the Chicken Madeira- a dish that I usually order & ALWAYS have loved. My dish came out with golf-ball sized mushroom slices and a quarter inch thick layer of plastic textured cheese. My mashed potatoes were good, I'll give em' that.  Unfortunately, this chain restaurant has definitely evolved for the worse over the years. This will not be my go to restaurant when I'm craving some good American food.

Melissa S.,"Pittsburg, CA",143,55,181,1.0,4/11/2017,"I would appreciate a phone call or response as soon as possible regarding this weekends visit. I was unfortunately told by one of your Cheesecake Factory wait staff then told by the manager nothing can be done about this problem. I've personally worked in the food industry before and know a transaction as simple as this can be reversed and recharged and therefore fixed. Here is the situation: My waitres told me  my gift cards were ""not good"". I've had these cards for several years and I've been waiting to use them for a very special occasion, for a very long time. It was extremely disappointing to be told they are null and void, since they were a Christmas gift from my grandmother. Allowing room for error I decided to speak to someone in management. Upon explaining to the manager that the gift cards were said ""not good"" it turns out that the cards indeed  we're good and did have the said cash on them.  After finding this out the manager refused to reverse the transaction and fix it. I have 2 gift cards with $25 on them each. Totaling $50. I was told there is ""nothing i can do and that I could use them another time"". This was not than frustrating. On top of all this it was a birthday dinner for my older brother to which they nearly forgot to sing the happy bday song, (a part of the night we were all looking forward to) On 3 occasions I had my fiancé ask to tell them; First when we arrived, second after we placed our order and then when the cheesecake arrived there was no song. That's when I had him go ask for the THIRD time. Finally they came with a scoop of ice cream in a cup and sang. Unfortunately there was so much disappointment the song was just awkward. I forgot to mention how my mom had told the waitress her turtle Cheesecake was hard to eat because it was overwhelmingly peanutbutter flavored. The waitress smiled as if not to hear a word my mother said so my  mother grudgingly finished her unsatisfactory slice. I didn't want to appear forward and ask for a replacement slice. Which I feel now I should have just asked. I understand the stress of a Saturday night in the restaurant industry. However that is what tips are for ""To Insure Promt Service"". I've eaten at Cheesecake many times in the past and  have never received such dissatisfactory service. I can't believe I forgot to mention the alc beverage  that I ordered and did not receive. I'm just blown away at the unacceptable service this night. Not to mention the cob salads my mother and brother both ordered were laden in iceberg lettuce lacking the said bacon and many other listed ingredients the menu had promised. I really hope Someone takes the time to read this and get back to me As soon as possible. I would have no problem sending in the reciepts for a refund. if that is not possible at least be comped for the drink I never received & my mother and brothers birthday cob salads and possibly the  overwhelmingly peanut butter flavored turtle cheesecake (she did eat the majority of the cake slice so I will understand if the last request is not met).

The complimentary bread and butter were nice. Had to ask for small plates for the bread because our server forgot, but no big deal. Back to the bread, the sourdough bread didn't have much flavor, even with the butter. The darker brown bread on the other hand, was delectable! It was very soft and had great flavor, and the butter added to the flavor.  After we ordered, we waited quite a while - about 20 minutes. Our server, Cesar, was nice and addressed us as ""my ladies"" which was so nice.  We ordered the lunch specials: Pasta Carbonara: spaghetti with smoked bacon, green peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce ($12.95) and the Skinnylicious Chicken Enchiladas: didn't get a description ($13.50).  The enchilada were on the spicy side for me, but it was nice for my mom. She had some pickled vegetables on the side which she said was refreshing. Good sized salad.

I told the waiter and asked to take out the old avocado and replace with fresh ones, he took it and came back and told me that the chef said they will replace the whole salad which me happy. Waited for 15 mins but when he came back it was the same salad, they left the brown avocado but added few new ones in top. It stated terrible and told the waiter when he came to check but gave me a bad excuse that they couldn't take the avocado out so they don't mess the salad which contradicting to what he told that they will replace the whole salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=300

Given that they are a chain, they provide good service, good food and a full bar. They also offer valet parking but the validation stamp, I believe only knocks down the price from perhaps $15 to $10 if it doesn't anything at all. It actually might not. I was told the fee for parking in valet. I suppose I'm confused why Cheesecake Factory waste their time stamping the tickets if the fee remains the same. But that is neither here nor there.

Granted the girl at the cake counter was busy, but it not only took another 20 minutes to get my food, the order was incorrect. It surprised me as the girl who took my call asked for all the necessary details, but lo and be hold, asking for fries on the phone doesn't equate for fries with my order. I went to the hostess to correct my order.  What peeves me the most is that I called for pick up, gave the restaurant ample time to make my order, and Cheesecake still managed to screw up and give me my food an HOUR after I called.

We moved to  Lafayette about 3 years ago and we have the Walnut Creek closer now. Well I waited about 5 bad experiences to write this review. Basically the service is Ok and the location is quite nice but the food is HORRIBLE  And not consistent at all.  NOTHING to do with the Cheesecake Factory level- The people there  cook as they feel like it... and they change completely the way they cook when ordering the exact same thing. It is such a disappointing experience to go to eat and relax ... and have to put up with whatever they serve you. ( It took me a while to learn)  Today I finally spoke with the server and he ""agreed""  with my point then a ""manager "" came to talk to us - took 10 minutes of out time and did nothing about it in the spot. What and apology?!!  Sorry, but that does not fix the experience we had AND  we paid for it! I am starting to leave reviews of bad places  (a monster business like this might not get affected but they may pay more attention after several bad reviews they have)  Still I want to save some people the negative  experience if I can.

I understand more food for more people but the price should differ. Anyway the first time I got them, they were amazing! The next few times they've been hard and seemed old.

Murat A.,"Moraga, CA",1,11,,1.0,3/18/2017,"My family had one of the most frustrating dining experiences in this particular location, from customer service to food. It was a chain of events that really turned our Friday night family dinner into a complete headache. First, getting a table... We were told there was a 20 min wait, which was totally acceptable for a Friday. Then at the 20th minute, I go to the front desk to check what's happening and learn that my name is not in the system, there was a ""technical problem"". Saying so sorry, they said now they would expedite our table. Then passes another 20 min, people who came long after us start getting tables, I ask again and they say again sorry, don't know what happened, and now promise to get a table for us right away. And in another 10 min close to 50 min mark, they say our table is ready. By that time, my 3 yr old was starving (going from a 20 min wait to 50 min) and was fussy and we all were feeling exhausted because of such a long wait. So at this point, you would assume they would try to make up for all the frustration. But wait. They show us a table for 2 people! Literally, one of those narrow tiny ones, and suggest bringing over a high chair for my kid, for which there clearly is no room. And going back and forth between the front desk, we finally get a booth, at the 1 hr mark. And the food. What a story. My kid's food, which was supposed to come asap, comes 5 minutes after our food. My wife ordered steak tacos, which came cold, tasted way below mediocre, with tiny amount of rice they put on the side, which was very very dry. I ordered a Shephard's pie. To my surprise, it did not come as a ""pie"" but was basically ground beef and veggies mixed in a bowl with mashed potatoes on top! I had to reconfirm that I got the right meal, because if looked so not like a pie. The taste was way below average, for the $15-20 price mark.

I wait ten minutes to have my order taken, not only because they are busy - but the two cashiers were missing in action for the ten minutes I was waiting. So I finally place my order. After 10-12 minutes I come back and ask the cashier, how will i know its ready, do you call out a number, he says no, we call out the cheesecake. Ok, poor way of organization in a busy place but whatever. Meanwhile there are about a dozen cheesecakes on their counter in to go packages waiting to be picked up - but no one is calling them out! I wait another ten minutes, I think I may have heard one cheesecake called out during that time, and it wasn't for me. I went to the cashier and told him, after 25 minutes now,  if my cheesecake is not ready I want my money back. He looks down and there is my cheesecake that has been sitting there for 20 minutes - I remember seeing it when I went to the cashier the previous time. So much for calling out the cheesecakes. Totally unacceptable service for a paying customer. But I do not blame this totally on the cashiers..it is primarily the MANAGER AT FAULT. If i could give a negative five stars I would.

The flavor was exceptional, meat was tender and the sides were great.   The reason why I say hit or miss on the food is because I have had some not great tasting food...  Example being the buffalo chicken sandwich the buffalo sauce is poor and the chicken was overly crispy.  I think they might do better on the food end of they paired down there menu, the menu is huge and it's difficult to be great at so many different foods.   I have never had any service problems at this location.  It can get very crowded but it's a popular location so you should expect a wait if you come at the busy times.   The Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake is epic.  Never meant a cheesecake I didn't like so good.  Definitely have dessert!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=360

I would not suggest going there if you only have an hour for lunch breaks. It took us nearly an hour and a half without waiting to be seated since we got there rather early. Most restaurants try to get you in and out at lunch time because they know working people in the area don't have a lot of time to spend for lunch. As for the food, it was OK. Not like it used to be.

I ordered the Tuscan chicken with Farro and I kid you not, there was only about 2 tablespoons of Farro and the chicken portions looked about half the size they were a year ago. My wife got the chicken lettuce wraps and also stated that the chicken portions were much smaller than they used to be. My youngest son's cheeseburger was laughable.

They have a bar with two big screens, and the bar's usually crowded on most days.  The food is typically heavy, and we inevitably have to take home two boxes of unfinished food. . I would recommend the eggplant parmesan, the avocado rolls, the fried Mac and cheese, the pizzas and of course their cheesecakes.

Gabrielle T.,"Oakland, CA",219,258,530,1.0,6/23/2015,"So gross! Of course I know the Cheesecake Factory is disgusting and avoid it and chain restaurants of it's low-rung, overpriced caliber at all costs. But a friend's graduation lunch was hosted here and I had no choice. Out of what can only be described as an overwhelming (and clearly self-sacrificing to the point of physical and potentially gastrointestinal detriment) love for my BFF, I obliged.  I arrived and could smell the mixture of something sickeningly sweet, heavy cream, too much cheese and 16-year-old, overworked waiter sweat as soon as I entered the establishment. The place was a-bustle and a-shuffle with workers scrambling to accommodate throngs of graduates and their families and I immediately felt sorry for the staff as they hoisted ginormous portions more fitting for whole families than for one patron in front of folks. I navigated through tacky decor, oversized tables and beneath creepy imitation Vatican ceilings until I met up with my group and we began ordering. I ordered the Kale and Quinoa Salad and asked for the parm' and ""Lemon Vinaigrette"" on the side, in anticipation of what I figured would be a disgusting and muddy mess of a dressing. As could be guessed, the dressing (or horse slop, whichever you choose to believe) arrived in a silver saucer and looked to be the consistency and color of Dijon mustard. I asked the server if I could have a balsamic dressing instead, at which point she brought over a big ass bottle of balsamic and a bottle of olive oil and pretty much expected me to have at it.  This is the part where I return the salad and remind myself that I should've never expected anything other than this from the Cheesecake Factory, offenders of all things culinary and worthwhile. I would rather see all of my friends drop out of college, rebuke their Masters program acceptance offers and become streetwalkers than attend another graduation luncheon at this place.

Alan F.,"Hercules, CA",67,383,62,4.0,6/28/2015,"A good, reliable chain restaurant that my wife and I often visit when we see a movie at the Century Walnut Creek downtown, across the street.  A huge room, its décor cheery but somewhat ongepotchket.  Covered, heated outdoor seating available. Separate bar area.  Large, mid-priced menu, nothing terribly adventuresome but everything well-executed.  Today's dinner consisted of a good, mildly-seasoned white chicken chili and a big serving of fold-your-own Thai-style chicken lettuce wraps, with peanut sauce, tamarind sauce, and a sweetish mint-chili sauce.  Topped off, of course, with the house's signature cheesecake--tiramisu and mango-Key lime--both great, though I might have streamlined the process if I had simply injected them directly into my coronary arteries.  Friendly and attentive server (though, alas, resembling Telly Savalas more than Penny on /The Big Bang Theory/).  Restrooms scrupulously clean.  Free parking in a three-level city structure across the street, though this is sometimes full; valet parking service also available.

Jennifer N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",442,1068,2967,3.0,9/10/2014,"If you want to avoid the long lines here, a weeknight is your best bet. I'm simply not a fan, in general of The Cheesecake Factory. I don't get all the hoopla and hours long wait. But, when family is in town, they seem to consider this a ""celebratory"" spot during their trip. I guess on the positive tip, there should be something for everyone on the menu-it's vast. Some vegetarian options, but nothing that I'd come out of my way got. If you are veg, stick with the salads-their veggie burger was pretty appalling. It's an odd blend of grains that don't really mesh in to a patty and generally pretty flavorless. On a positive note, the service is usually prompt and friendly. The warm bread is my favorite part and the decor is interesting to look at. I don't really care for cheesecake, so that whole element is lost on me. It was a 2 star meal for me but to be fair I gave the whole experience a 3-I mean I can't fault a place with ""cheesecake"" in their name when I don't partake in their main feature....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=340
Briana S.,"Martinez, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/17/2017,I usually love this place it has been my favorite restaurant for about a year now. I've never cared much about the 30-2 hour wait they have because I love the food so much. Lately I feel that they have gotten a new chef or something has changed. The last couple times I've gone there have not been so pleasant. One time about a month ago me and my boyfriend went to dinner and I got a chicken entree with a pasta and the chicken was amazing but the pasta was half uncooked. I didn't think much of it other than it was the only bad experience and the main part of my food was good. Then the time after I ordered the same thing and so did my boyfriend. This time the chicken which I had loved was really bland and didn't taste very good. Also the pasta wasn't good either. I thought the chicken was just mine but my boyfriends tasted the same. I hope they change something because I love that place a lot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=340

Sydney P.,"Richmond, CA",21,12,39,4.0,12/20/2014,"My experiences at the Cheesecake Factory have always been so-so. I've been to many different locations but this one has got to be my favorite. The wait time was a lot shorter today (which is very odd because it's the weekend), but the service is so friendly! The unlimited, complimentary bread and butter is also a bonus. I got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and the Lunch Special Herb Crusted Fillet Salmon. It was delicious; by far my wisest combination.  - The salmon alone is cooked well, topped with plenty of herbs. It also comes with a special sour sauce, mashed potatoes, and 4 asparaguses. - I personally think the pasta I've gotten today is their best. I've tried others before and they definitely don't taste like ""4 stars"". But this specific one has certainly outdone itself. It has the perfect combination of sautéed shrimp and chicken with different peppers. Their Cajun Sauce is so rich, that it perfectly brings the whole dish together. It says ""Very Spicy"" but I think it has more of a small spicy after-taste (which I loved, but spices depend on different people).  Overall, it was one of the best experiences I've had. The prices weren't bad, based on the portions they come in. I wish I could've changed the pasta serving size because it was way more than I needed (I brought it home).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=340

My sister had the steak Diana and shrimp scampi combo. I had the garlic noodles with shrimp. Our friend had the Chinese chicken salad. We also shared two appetizers, the artichoke dip and the avocado eggrolls. I didn't try my sister's or our friend's dish, but it seemed like they liked their food since none of us had any complaints. I liked the artichoke dip the most out of the three items that I did try.  My garlic noodles were just ok, nothing that truly stands out.  As far as the avocado eggrolls, I'm not a big fan of onions so that kind of put me off already and the dipping sauce was really sweet. Our server, I believe his name was Manual, was very sweet and attentive.  He's very accommodating and didn't seem annoyed by the fact that we asked him to come back and take our orders in several trips.  We each ordered our drinks separately because we arrived in separate cars, minutes apart.

I was told to come in an hour before the needed time and to ask for certain areas in the restaurant that would accommodate our group.  I arrived one hour ahead of my needed time, spoke to Alexis at the front and she was ever so accommodating.  She said she remembered my call and to let her know when the group got here.  Our group was delayed by crazy traffic Alexis was concerned about the time and holding tables.  I understood totally as I could see that there were so many groups coming and going over the time I waited.  We were seated and the service was wonderful, the food was excellent.   AlI can say is I am glad that I called and mentioned the reviews and got some tips on how best to work with the restaurant especially with a large group.  I am also grateful to the reviewers because I was more acutely aware of what was going on at the restaurant.

My husband's $15.95 spaghetti and meatballs was bland and boring. Hospital style food at it's best. Now I can't comment on the cheesecakes as we were pretty discouraged at our meals and just wanted to get out of dodge, but in the past I recall them being pretty good.

Its been a while since I've been there, but some negative things Ive found about the restaurant were: Customer Service was a bit of an issue; employees spilling drinks on people (only happened once), drinks and food take for ever to come out, some employees can be somewhat forgetting, and 50% of the time, the food comes out the wrong way (either under/over cooked). Prices are fine due to the portion size and food quality (if it comes out the right way). The atmosphere is also a wow factor. I enjoy the multi-level seating.

The hostess should set the tone for the experience and she does...in a very negative way.

Angie D.,"Davis, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/29/2016,"I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but this location was just disappointing. My boyfriend and I went for dinner 3 days ago and were treated very poorly by one of the hosts. He told us the wait time was approximately 15 minutes and to wait on the side of the host table. He never gave us a buzzer because he said our name would be called when a table was available (which is complete bs because the manager said they're required to give you a buzzer). 20 minutes had passed and we noticed that several people were being seated before us, so we asked another hostess how much longer we had to wait. She looked at her list and told us there were 5 more parties of 2 that were before us. We said okay and continued to wait on the side. More and more people were getting seated and we realized that 50 minutes had passed. I finally stopped the host who gave us the initial wait time and asked him what was going on. He asked for our name, talked to the other hostesses, and came back and told us that someone had messed up. He then walked us to a table while we kept asking him questions about what had happened. First, he said someone else messed up and then he said our name was put on hold because he called it out 4 times. I was furious at this point. We waited right next to the host table for 50 minutes and not once did anyone call our name. Shortly after, he changed the story and said that he didn't call our name, but someone else did. So in other words, he lied to our face. Twice. He then said in verbatim, ""Well, here's your table."" He did not apologize nor take responsibility for his actions. Instead he gave us attitude, tried to make us feel like we were the ones who were wrong, and failed to provide at least decent customer service. This was all on top of giving us a completely inaccurate wait time.  We were so upset that we decided to just leave. We spoke to a manager and she apologized and reserved a table for us. We were so over it at this point and waited long enough so we decided to stay and eat there. We had a great server so that was the only good thing out of this whole experience. While the manager did try to compensate by giving us free dessert, it did not make up for the host's behavior and inability to do his job. I understand that people make mistakes but he could have just apologized and not lied. I would have been much more forgiving and probably wouldn't have even called for a manager.

Michael W.,"Lafayette, CA",0,5,18,1.0,1/4/2017,"My review is based on the way this restraunt is run and NOT so much the food. My hope is that someone from corporate will read this and try to make some changes because my family and I are HUGE fans of the food there. I have called to place togo orders there at least 10 times and ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS I wait on hold for approx 15-20 minutes. The last 2 times I have called I have waited on hold for over 30 minutes...the last being 37 minutes. One might ask, what kind of idiot would wait that long on hold...well ME I guess. But the reason is, I call from my house or business, get in the car and wait on hold. Last week I walked in while STILL being on hold (34 mins of hold) looked for a manager, couldn't find one and then left to go eat elsewhere. It is AWFUL and at least 30% of the time my order is wrong if I do get to order and pick it up. Second, when we eat IN the restaurant, ALMOST always...our food will come out at completely different times. Sometimes upwards of 5 to 10 minutes different. So half the table is either eating while the other half waits OR their food gets cold while we wait. And the CHERRY ON TOP...This year I decided to have them cater my xmas party....So I called (and yes I waited on hold for EVER) got a person...ordered close to $800 worth of food for pick up 2 days later. Was told I would get a call back in 15 minutes to verify the order, amount and pick up time. 2 hours later I had no call. SO, I called back...(yes, waited on hold) got a person, my order was found, UN COMPLETED (pricing etc) in the system. I re-ordered, verified the entire order TWICE with the lady and verified pick up....On the night of the party December 11 at 4:30 when the order was to be ready, I showed up and .....wait for it.....YEP....NOBODY COULD FIND THE ORDER AND IT WASN'T COOKED OR READY!.....Now, I had over 40 people waiting at my business waiting to eat, drink etc. And I now have NO food. After finding a manager and explaining my ""problem"" she found my order in the system and after her doing all she could, I ended up waiting over an hour PLUS..I had people waiting at the party venue, cold, hungry, etc....my kids in the car and my year end xmas party was officially a ball of stress. So the head manager, who didn't even have the decency to come talk to me told the VERY NICE and pregnant manger to ""take of the price of the Apps....."" I was soooo disgusted AND had people waiting that I couldn't say anything or dispute this any further, I had to rush to the party....I talked with the manager who was doing what she could in her capacity and she essentially said, her hands were tied. I am a business owner and do NOT like negativly reviewing businesses but I feel like this one just needs to get SOMEONE to take charge of management down there and get it fixed. Because the food is great and the location is perfect but whoever is running it from a management point of view would be fired 5 times over in my business. I HOPE this finds SOMEONE in corporate and they do something to fix these VERY fixable issues. And Thank you to the pregnant manager who did what she could to solve the immediate issue that fateful night.  Here's to hoping!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=460
Precious D.,"Pittsburg, CA",4,13,1,1.0,10/3/2015,"Our experience today was horrible! NEVER again will we come back to this place!!! I would never recommend this place to anyone, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE PETS - unprofessional management.  My sister, nephews, and I decided to have lunch at the restaurant after taking my dog to the park. We wanted to enjoy the patio seating outside of the restaurant, but we called ahead to make sure dogs are allowed - which they are. (Other Cheesecake Restaurants we've been to we're very accommodating to my dog EXCEPT the one in WALNUT CREEK.)  As we sat down, we were given horrible looks from the table across from us (a man and an older woman) because we had my dog with us. Note, my dog is a blue nose Pitbull. He is the sweetest dog but due to the Pitbull reputation, ignorant people discriminate right away.  As the waiter approached me, my dog was under the table and slightly growled but stopped immediately after I commanded him. Then the woman across made an unacceptable comment ""That's why you shouldn't bring dogs at restaurants"". Moments later, a manager named Cassandra came up to our table to let us know ""that people were complaining because your dog is barking"". First of all, my dog did NOT bark at anyone. If she didn't come to our table, then the other people wouldn't have noticed. She stated that many people were complaining, and that my dog was barking a lot, which was false. It was just that one IGNORANT person across from us that couldn't handle seeing a pitbull. This manager was accommodating to that one customer but NOT US. She basically made a scene and made us and the people around us feel so uncomfortable. If that's what you call a manager, then they should reevaluate her again.  We requested another manager to speak to, and AGAIN he was against our dog! He said that the other manager said my dog was barking at so many people including her which was such a big lie. The only thing that caused this commotion was the growl (which was immediately stopped) and the complaint of the other customer (that was not even part of anything - my dog did NOT bark at her nor even LOOKED her way) so I don't understand why they would cater to her and avoid our needs as customers also.  My sister and I decided to take our food to-go instead because we just felt unwelcomed!  But on a lighter note, we had two servers approach us to comfort us and let us know that they love my dog - a Pitbull.  This management could have handled this situation more professionally.

Susan H.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",134,74,14,1.0,11/29/2014,"Well my husband and I have been faithful supporters for cheesecake factory since grad school days 10 years ago. We happened to be in walnut creek today and thought this would be a good place to end the day with.  So I ordered the grilled salmon and he ordered angel hair. The salmon turned out to be super dry, like those overcooked chicken breast that i had to chew quite hard in order to swallow. His shrimps were fewer than usual and overcooked super dry as well.  I finally decided to talk to the waiter after finishing the second bite. The waiter was nice enough to redo the order for me. Their manager also came out to do a simple apology. i thought that was a nice gesture. we waited a long time for the second one.. in fact i finished the rest of the food and decided to pack up the new salmon piece when it arrives. When it arrived. it was super small.. about half of the original order. compared with this picture, the previous apology did not seem genuiun at all.  By then, I did not think it was fair for me to discuss this matter further and wasted more time over a properly cooked, fair portion of salmon.. this incident was very disappointing that we even decided to skip our dessert and just went home.  The reason that I wrote up this review serves as a reminder to the restaurant not to compromise their quality standard even though it is a busy holiday season. if you are understaffed, hire some seasonal help! you can't let customer bear the cost like this.. not sure if  this is a cheesecake factory problem or just this location...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=460

Though I have nothing that has come close to the Farmhouse burger they used to have, everything I've had since then has been pretty solid. Just not quite a home run with me.  Though their Sunday brunch items are all very good.   Service has been much better since my first experience though the wait times always seem to be in consistent.  It would be nice to be offered bar space if available right out  the gate. We always seem to have to ask.  I know it's nit picky but to me that's a sign of a host/hostess making the extra effort.  In the end it's hard to go wrong here when you're with folks who can appreciate Cheesecake for what it is and not try and compare it to anything else but other chains around.  For my money Benihana, Cheesecake, and Chili's are the best in the business and it shows in their staff and their food.

We each ordered a different entree and for the most part we were all satisfied. My daughter's gumbo was the best meal. I thought the other meals were a little blah. Three of us ordered cheesecake. The vanilla bean, dulce de leche, & caramel pecan turtle. Most definitely my daughter's plain vanilla bean was the best. I'll try that next time with the chocolate sauce.  The service was terrific. Our server was quite attentive. He gave us a pitcher of ice to satisfy my needs. He also gave my friend & SIL a large block of cheese + a grater. The guys were astounded by all that cheese & ended up taking the remainder home with their leftovers.   The nicest thing about this restaurant is the location. It is in the gourmet ghetto in downtown Walnut Creek, where parking is problematic. Luckily, there is a 3 story garage attached to the restaurant. Since I am disabled we used the valet service. It's only $7 with validation. Or you can self park for free on the upper floors.  I've heard so much about how great the Cheesecake Factory restaurants are for decades.

Lesley M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,9,,2.0,9/10/2016,"My husband and I went to have dinner last night, and when I checked in with the hostess, I was told it would be a 35 minute wait, which was fine.  She told me to come back in 15 because there were no pagers.  Being on crutches made it difficult for me to do so, so my husband went back over in 15 minutes and was told it would be another 26 minutes. No pager was given to him.  After we waited for an hour, watching other guests get called by name in front of us, I finally hobbled up to the hostess and asked what was going on.  She said ""We called your name, but you didn't respond"", to which I said ""My name was never called. I've been sitting here waiting for an hour watching others called.""  She then said we'd have to wait another two or three minutes.  And then she handed me a pager.  When I hobbled back to sit down, my husband was fed up and went back to her and told her the next name called needs to be our name.  We finally got seated.  This hostess was simply incompetent, inconsiderate of my physical condition and rude.  The redeeming person in this whole experience was our waitress, Rheena, because she asked how we were, and when she heard our frustration, she asked what she could do to make us feel better. We asked for a complimentary cocktail, which she could not do but she offered us a complimentary dessert instead.  That simple gesture made up for the sins of the hostess.  And our dinner was very good too.   I think last night's hostess needs better training - she was in over her head on a very busy night.  She is the first person a customer interacts with in your restaurant - it should be imperative that the initial customer experience be flawless.  For us, it wasn't.

When I arrived I asked for the Jane Doe party. The hostess turned her back to me and gestured toward the back of the restaurant. I explained that I have trouble hearing and she repeated this useless performance. Isn't it the hostess's job to seat guests? I spent five minutes wandering around looking for my party. Multiple wait staff nearly ran into me but nobody offered to help. Plus: Our server was pleasant and very cheerful about accommodating one of our party's very specific requests, checking in to make sure the meal had been prepared properly. Minus: One person ordered a couple of starters for the table and our server failed to ask if anybody else wanted anything. I did. Minus: The hibachi steak was cooked perfectly but it was a bunch of small pieces of stir fried meat, not a steak.

The manager couldn't be found. I mean, I don't blame him, I wanted to run and hide from the atrocity on my plate as well. Finally, the cook explained to the waiter that sometimes they are just crispy.

It took our server 10 minutes to get to us (which isn't the end of the world but still 10 minutes) and by that time we were ready to order. We waited an average time for appetizers and food. My brother ordered a cheese pizza that came completely burnt on the bottom, like enough that you could see it was burnt through the cheese. Obviously, he requested it be re-made. It took another 15 minutes for his new pizza to come out, when everyone else was basically done eating. He had to ask a third time for Ranch.

There are plenty of servers around, but trying to get one to stop and give you service can **sometimes** be difficult. Usually they are pretty friendly, but when they aren't they miss by a mile, it truly ruins the whole meal.  Chicken Bellagio, Chicken Madeira or the Cajun Pasta are my usually ""go-to"" entrees. For a lighter fare, their walnut, goat cheese salad is very good. Don't be fooled, it can be pretty pretty pricy depending what you get. Even when you try to be budget friendly, you'll spend between $15 - $20 per person.  When it's cooler (not ICE cold), they have a gas fireplace outside. If you are lucky enough to sit by it, there is not better feeling. I had the Cajun Pasta this past Sunday when it was 105 degrees outside.

The ceilings are 30' high, there are ornate Venetian light fixtures everywhere, huge pillars that are hand painted - wow. Am I still in sleepy suburban Walnut Creek? Yes, it's the Cheesecake Factory.  But what an amazing little piece of real estate they've transformed in downtown Walnut Creek. I sat at the bar area and admired the wall 'o alcohol - an amazing array of everything you can get at BevMo. My waiter didn't seem too knowledgeable on gluten-free.  When I mentioned gluten, the response was: ""hmmm.  wait, is that like wheat?"". So I played it safe, and went for things I knew would be gluten free. First up was the ""Boston Salad""  which is a savory salad topped with chopped bacon and blue-cheese.   I ordered it with the Citrus Honey dressing - it was a small portion, but very good. I also ordered some sweet potato fries, but with no Chipotle Mayo Dipping Sauce - a quick google search on my phone showed that it has gluten.  Overall, it was a solid 4-star meal that did the job. For other gluten-free peeps out there, please note that they don't have a gluten-free menu.  No allergen menu even.  So you are on your own.   The menu is about 14 pages long, so I see why - what a nightmare it would be to do a gluten-free version. Note these sleeper items are NOT gluten-free: * Ranch Dressing * Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing * French Fries * All Cheesecakes But these ARE gluten-free: * White Bean Hummus- If ordered without Warm Flatbread * Little House Salad- If ordered without Balsamic Vinaigrette * Quesadilla- If ordered without Corn Tortilla and with Simply Grilled Chicken * Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke- If ordered without Spicy Vinaigrette * Ahi Carpaccio- If ordered without Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce and Togarashi Aioli * Thai Lettuce Wraps- If ordered without Spicy Peanut Vinaigrette, Thai Peanut Sauce and Sweet Red Chili Dipping Sauce * Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes- If ordered without Tomatillo Cream Sauce * Tossed Green Salad- If ordered without Croutons * Caesar Salad- If ordered without Croutons, and with Simply Grilled Chicken * Boston House Salad- If ordered without Croutons or Ranch Dressing * French Country Salad- If ordered without Balsamic Vinaigrette and Shallot Vinaigrette * Fresh Vegetable Salad- If ordered with Simply Grilled Chicken * Factory Chopped Salad- Order with Simply Grilled Chicken and without Balsamic Vinaigrette * Cobb Salad- If ordered without Balsamic Vinaigrette * Chinese Chicken Salad - If ordered without Wontons and Chinese Plum Dressing * Herb-Encrusted Salmon Salad-without Balsamic Vinaigrette * Gluten free salad dressings:  Caesar, Citrus Honey, Lo-Cal Mustard Vinaigrette * Factory Burger- If ordered without Sourdough French or Wheat Loaf. * Classic Burger- If ordered without Hamburger Bun * Grilled Turkey Burger- If ordered without Hamburger Bun * Fresh Grilled Salmon- If ordered without Tartar Sauce * Fresh Grilled Mahi Mahi- If ordered without Tartar Sauce * Grilled Pork Chops- If ordered without Honey Mustard Glaze * Grilled Rib-Eye Steak- If ordered without Onion Rings and Au Jus * Petite Filet- If ordered without Onion Rings and Au Jus * Filet Mignon- If ordered without Onion Rings or Au Jus * Sweet Potato Fries- If ordered without Chipotle Mayonnaise * Sautéed Snow Peas and Vegetables- If ordered without Soy Sauce",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=480

She refilled our lemonades  but didn't offer to refill the orange juice as a courtesy for the long wait. Shortly afterward, one order was served. We waited another 10 minutes for the other two orders. We immediately saw that the breakfast potatoes were burnt, and that the grilled ham was missing on one order. We notified the server who apologized and went to follow up with kitchen. The kitchen manager came to our table and admitted the potatoes were ""a bit over cooked"" so I asked him if he would eat them as-is and he agreed that he probably wouldn't. Within 10 minutes the potatoes and ham were served. We were shocked however to see that the bill was not even adjusted to reflect this poor service. An apology was hand-written on the bill.

We had a small party of 3.  It's Friday night so very busy, and we were fine with the 40 minute wait. We put our name in, got a buzzer and some drinks and sat outside to wait. Very nice ambience outside so we enjoyed ourselves until we noticed the waiting area clearing out and our buzzer never going off. After an hour we asked about the status of our table. The girl had to ask someone else and then took the buzzer back and said we would be seated shortly. After 10 minutes more we were finally seated. Nearly double the time we were initially told. No apologies for the wait.  As we were being walked back to our table, the hostess asked if we were celebrating anything. I mentioned it was my mom's bday and she asked her name so they could come sing. That never happened.  We got our menus and our server took our order. Our food came fairly quickly and we ate. My mom loved her food (miso salmon, although she said it tasted more like teriyaki), but my sister and I were not crazy about ours which were absolutely drenched in sauces that weren't very good (lemon herb chicken and shrimp scampi/steak Diane combo).  Then we sat and waited for our server to come back and check in so we could ask for boxes and possibly order some cheesecake. And we waited. And waited. For over 30 minutes where he was nowhere in sight (and he'd already been on break and back because another girl was introduced to us and helping during his break). Finally he came back to box our food and we asked for a dessert menu. He disappeared again so we decided to have my sister get the cheesecake to go from the front while I tried to get the check. That took another 20 minutes or so. We got there around 7 and didn't leave until after 10. Never once did anyone apologize for the long waits. I work in customer service and little things like that go a long way.  All in all I was displeased with the LONG waits and the service. Food really wasn't great either, especially for the price.

I keep promising I'll never return and then an out-of-town guest or family member (under 12) invariably talks me into giving this place another chance. But it's always the same disappointing experience. First of all, this place is outrageously overpriced for what you get, especially the cocktails, which are not even priced on the menu, so you get major sticker shock when the bill arrives later! Wth? I didn't even think that was legal. The bathrooms are always nasty and out of paper supplies or soap. The food is salty or bland (nothing in between); the bread is often hard; the tables and floors are always greasy and slippery, and they dim the lights so low each night for ""ambiance,"" that the seeing-impaired need to be assisted because they can't see the menu! If making a public place this dark isn't illegal, it should be! At least let me see the greasy, slippery floors I'm skidding across in my heals. Ugh. One of the worst chain restaurants ever.

Had their Kobe beef hamburger which I've had before and it was absolutely fantastic. My cousin had the same thing and she fell in-love with it...and she's NOT a ""hamburger person"" by any stretch of the imagination, so that's a compliment! My wife had  the ""everything pizza."" And she stated that it was one of THE BEST pizza's she had in a very long time.  We're lovers of Aladino's pizza and have been for several years. She said that this pizza was FAR BETTER than Aladino's, so it MUST have been really good because she's extremely picky about what she eats. The Highlight of the meal though was when I tried their new Lemon Meringue cheese cake.  That was a multi-orgasmic experience, and it's the only way to describe it. I'm sure it had a bazillion calories and fat grams, but it was worth every bite!  If you're a cheese cake lover, this is a MUST-EAT dessert item! AWESOME!

Eric B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2128,5344,4760,4.0,8/9/2012,"With its over-the-top Vegas-type decor (inside and out) and emphasis on large portioned gluttony, my visits to The Cheesecake Factory have been far and few between. For many, those features are exactly the point, and the Big Bang Theory TV series references probably help (eh, Wil Wheaton?). There's also a movie theater across the street and all of Downtown Walnut Creek beyond, so a dinner and movie date night seems to be an excellent option (among others). Then there's the matter of my Teenage Son and how much he might enjoy the many choices of food and of course dessert. On that note alone, I'll probably be back.  I was here for Lunch today as part of a Service Celebration. A colleague had reached a significant milestone of working for our Company for 30 years, and this meal was on us as a small token of our appreciation. We had a great time and very full meals, so much so that my Cheesecake slice will be coming home tonight for Family consumption.  I even thought that I had ordered light, but even a half sandwich (turkey), soup (chicken tortilla), and Caesar salad (The Renee's Special, same as Toni) was two enough for me. The interior space is huge and custom built for groups of all sizes. There's also a full bar up front, but unfortunately there would be no alcohol today as this was a work-related function. The food was surprisingly very good and the service was even better in terms of folks being friendly, helpful, and fast. So even though I still consider Cheesecake Factory to be a 3 Star dining option (e.g. OK, but I wouldn't go out of my way), our experience today clearly exceeded the sum of its parts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=500

How does a salad hold up a dinner by an hour.  After speaking with the manager he stated it took so long because the chicken was bad on the salad.  The fries were cold, and still cold when they brought back new fries.  We spoke to the manager about the horrible experience we were having and he offered cheesecake, but at this point the dinner was ruined.  We declined dessert and suggested he take the meals off the bill especially since he admitted the salad was the challenge with us waiting an hour for our food and the food was not good. He declined and said he could only offer cheesecake.  I informed him he was making our experience even worse.  He just walked away.  The manager took the cheese burger off the bill, but no one ever came over to even apologize or tell us they were taking anything off.  I really like the Cheesecake Factory and feel at this point we are not welcome here.  I do not think we will ever be returning to the Walnut Creek location again.  I feel we were treated not like customers, but like we a nuisance.  My boyfriend's birthday was ruined by this experience and we will never get that evening back again.  There are many other great restaurants within the area.  I recommend trying those instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=500

Jessie O.,"Danville, CA",52,213,81,3.0,3/26/2016,"We came to The Cheesecake Factory around 8:00pm on a Thursday evening. We waited about 30 minutes for a table along with about 20-30 other people. I think we hit the end of the dinner rush. In hindsight I might have made a reservation. They have a great waiting/sitting area outside with heaters and a fire pit where you can sip drinks while checking your buzzer for a table every couple minutes. The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite chain restaurant for a romantic evening. The ambiance is great with the dim lighting and fancy aesthetic. I feel like I'm high rolling while I'm there. It feels like I'm dining at a high end resort. Unfortunately, the prices are fairly comparable with high end resort dining without the dining room views over a lake or golf course or the option of retiring to your luxury suite after the meal. My husband's mediocre salad was about $16, the same price as my fettucine alfredo (without the additional meat, which is extra). Both entrees seemed priced high. That's why we don't come here very often. It's a treat. My husband's barbeque ranch chicken salad came with frozen (yes, FROZEN!) tomatoes. That was the tip off that the tomatoes weren't fresh or hand chopped. Everything tasted like it was from a can he said and that he would feed the leftovers to our pet chicken. My fettucine alfredo was fine. We ordered the Adam's Peanut Butter  blah blah Ripple something cheesecake to go following our meal. After a couple days since we dined, it's still untouched in the fridge so I can't yet comment on it. But, it's the same cheesecake I always get when I dine at The Cheesecake Factory. It's my favorite, so hopefully they didn't screw that up. All in all, I enjoyed our dining experience for the most part, but since my husband already has to compromise to come here since he doesn't like it, it didn't help that his salad was so awful.

At that time, we requested a smaller cup for my sister's iced tea and some sweetener. A quick fix, right? Well, after waiting for a substantial time, my wife went to an adjoining table to retrieve some sweetener and asked one of the busboys for a small cup, which he immediately retrieved. When our server came by and saw that the cup and sweetener had been taken care of (by someone other than him, he apologized, and said our food would be right out.

Problem is we come here a lot and we wont stop coming here because we like a nice sit down place and its close to my work downtown.... Here's the breakdown: Drinks: 5 stars Food: 3 Service: 3.5 Cleanliness: 4.5 Cheesecake: OMG 5 I'm always strangely optimistic about ordering food here. What sounds good on paper is always better that what you get. Maybe it's because its such an enormous menu, they can't spend too much time making every entree special and perfect. Maybe they should stick to drinks and dessert. Speaking of drinks: I love cocktails,here  they're strong and flavorful and they always come out to the table looking beautiful as ever. We've started ordering slices of cheesecake to-go, as we are usually too full for it after dinner or lunch. But just as I remember from many many years ago, their cheesecake is TO DIE FOR. It's called the cheesecake factory for a reason. If you have a drink and dinner and leave, I'm sure your review of the place would be SIGNIFICANTLY different than if you had cheesecake too :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=520
Tina A.,"San Francisco, CA",247,796,297,3.0,8/21/2012,"Cheesecake factory is generally consistent, but this one is a little below par in comparison to san francisco (which i used to go to every month) Firecraker Salmon Rolls - super yummy, small portion appetizer as always, but over here they make the salmon well done instead of leaving the center raw, so it was drier than usual but the sauce was still super yummy and they gave a HUGE amount of red cabbage, which made it look like it was more than just a garnishing, so we ate it and it was not bitter at all Tex Mex Eggrolls - mexico meets china wonton wrappers, it was pretty awesome and probably my favorite of the night.  corn, cheese, chicken, and other goodies packed into an eggrol. Cajun Chicken Jambalaya - the same delicious large portion of seasoned chicken and pasta, however it was SUPER salty compared to what i'm used. Shrimp Scampi - the sauce was a delicious heart attack of butter waiting to happen, but the shrimp did not have that crispy hot battered crust that i'm used to having, it was a little undercooked and soggy, but everything in that sauce is just too awesome Cookie Dough Cheesecake - YUM!!  is all i have to say.  my personal favorite is the white chocolate raspberry truffle but pretty much all the cheesecakes here are amazing being consistently safe, cheesecake factory is always a good choice when no one knows where to go for dinner",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=520
Jash P.,"La Mirada, CA",436,299,793,4.0,1/31/2013,"I didn't think our venture into Walnut Creek would include a familiar restaurant: Cheesecake Factory. Well, it was worth it, especially when we took our friend for her first time, and also sneakily surprised/embarrassed her with a birthday cheesecake at the end of the meal! Wait Time: None. Excuse me?! Are we at the right place? Usually, we wait at least 45 minutes to get seated at our local Cheesecake factory in the City. Context, we did go on a Tuesday night around 7:30pm. You'd think more people would be going out during dinner time. Food: We split deep fried macaroni and cheese balls. YUM! Ever since my friend introduced me to them, we must always order that appetizer. I had the shrimp scampi pasta. It was definitely on the rich side, and very filling! Their brownie sundae was disappointing. I must have had high expectations; I was expecting something akin to Ghirardeli's sundaes, but nope, the brownie was not chewy, and the presentation was spread out on a plate rather than in a cup/bowl. Thus, ORDER THEIR CHEESECAKE for dessert; you won't be disappointed with that. Service:  Our waiter Billy was super helpful! Hah, he definitely understood my subtle hints on reminding him of our bday surprise! Validation: If you parked in the parking structure near SF Creamery, you are in no luck. They won't take your parking token. They even asked me what was I giving them/where I got the token -_-! For those that parked valet near Cheesecake Factory, they will validate your parking ticket!

This has to be my top bay area spot, other then one I went to in LA. I love the location and the service. The food has NEVER EVER disappointed me. Sometimes it can be a bit pricey, but I think it is a great upscale spot for lunch dates, and dinners.  They have a beautiful dinning area out side with like a fire pit to keep you warm. My go to meal is the 3 cheese penne and a fresh strawberry shortcake. Also if their main menu seems to be a little outside you budget the have a great lunch menu for like half the price, and they serve til 5pm. So you can get great lunch or an early dinner.  Last but not least they recently added a new skinny menu, so they offer most of the same great foods, but they cut down the calories and carbs.

Amy S.,"Concord, CA",881,1790,13555,3.0,7/8/2012,"I like the Cheesecake Factory and I feel like service there can be really great or really disappointing. It's pretty inconsistent. Typically the food is really good.  My fiance and I had an important meeting (6/6/12) with my boss the other night so we wanted to take him and his wife to dinner.  We all met at the restaurant and I ordered a grilled artichoke as an appetizer ($5 for Happy Hour) - my fiance ordered the spiniach artichoke dip $5 HH menu as well).  I have to say, 9 out of 10 times the food is excellent. The artichoke on this particular evening was awful. I am not sure they boiled it at all before grilling it: Tough, unflavorful, almost inedible  :(  The spinach dip was great - but we had a semi-smaller table in the bar area (though, it was regular seating - not bar service) and the spinach plate and chip plate were huge. It overwhelmed the small table and our limited space.   For dinner my fiance ordered sliders ($5 HH menu), as did my boss' wife. They both seemed pleased with the food and finished their smaller plates.  My boss ordered a huge sandwich & salad combo. I actually didn't pay attention to what the sandwich was but he said it was good - except that he ordered his plate with NO cheese, and it arrived with cheese. In the salad AND sandwich.  He's extremely lactose intolerant and had to be careful while eating.  I ordered the lettuce wraps - very good, except for the 3 sauces it came with.  P.F. Chang's serves this on their HH menu and they make a spicy, soy sauce type dip to go with it - I asked for hot sauce but received Tobasco. Can I call the weak sauce patrol? Not really thick enough for dipping... All four of us ordered (non-alcoholic) drinks. My boss and his wife had a sweetened tea, I had unsweetened tea, and my fiance had a Coke. Before the dinner was over, my fiance's half-full Coke was filled.... with tea.  Yes, tea - and he hates tea. My unsweetened tea was also filled at one point, with a sweetened tea. I drank it but I felt the server really messed up big time here. His lack of attention to detail was annoying and it makes you think twice the next time you're picking a place for dinner. AND we were never offered dessert or cheesecake at the end. I don't know that I would have accepted for sure, but my boss said something as we were walking out - and often if other people order dessert, I do too. The dinner was $59.27 before tip. Not terrible for a group of four - but having to pay even $1 for service like that makes me grimace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=540
Tiana A.,"Antioch, CA",3,30,14,2.0,7/21/2014,"After 16 days of works (& counting) my fiancé and I finally decided to ask my sister to watch the kids to get a Mommy & Daddy night. We decided to try the Cheesecake Factory after rave reviews from family and friends. As we arrived, we were in awe how beautiful it was.. Inside and OUT! Fire fountain in middle of the outside waiting area (which was filled) and then all the beautiful lights and structural masterpieces within the building.  We arrived at 6:42pm on A Sunday. We put our names in, only 20 min wait for two, no problem! We went outside enjoy the beautiful view of the fire fountain and street. Now, in Cheesecake Factory when your table is ready they text you! Wow, way to blow our minds.. I mean in a world no one really talks on the phone, pretty amazing. We got our text at 7:05, we went to the front & was told ""Great! Step to the side & your waiter will be back to walk to your table!"" Well, SIX other families also got that same text AFTER us and went to their tables before us. FOUR other couples stepped to the side AFTER us and when to their tables. All along after, another 20 min wait, we received a table. (Almost an hour now)  We got a small booth in the back, which was overlooked by another booth. Awkward..  It was NOISY! Kids screaming, people chattering, silver wear clanking... Not as intimate as we were expecting!  We ordered Orange chicken & Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimp. My fiancé loved his chicken. My shrimp was OVERcooked to the point it was chewy. Gross. I didn't even eat the angel hair pasta because the ""touch"" of marinara was covering the plate. (I'm not found of marinara sauce, on any dish.) either I misread the description of my plate, or they winged in the kitchen.  Overall:  Somewhere we would not visit again.

Leaving I just didn't feel happy.  My recommendation is if you come here and you are hungry, don't!  Be slightly hungry, because it will be a while before you are seated, have you order taken and when your food is placed in front of you. *Bonus:  The outdoor seating!  That looked so cool.  There are heated lamps and a beautiful fireplace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=540

This location is huge and the interior is beautiful and looks like a fancy hotel. The outside eating area is pretty nice, too, though a great deal quieter than inside (TURN DOWN THE MUSIC!)  The Cheesecake Factory is best for comfort food. Though they do have a diet menu, something I cannot say of other chain restaurants, nothing on it really appealed to me. The burger I had was delicious and the Oreo shake I had was okay, but not as thick as I would have hoped for. They are also one of those restaurants that serves HUGE portions and then asks you if you want dessert afterward (um, no thanks. I'm stuffed after those HUGE portions of food).  The service was decent up until we got our food, then it got sort of strange. The servers we had were friendly, but at times a bit too friendly. I declined on a slice of tasty sounding, but caloric and fattening, piece of cheesecake and got a ""but it's the Cheesecake Factory!"" from our server, which I felt was a teeny bit rude. Before that, a server made a comment on my food (""a cheeseburger and a milkshake. That's a lot of food!""), which I felt was also a bit rude. I understand that they were trying to be friendly, but they were trying too hard in my book and it made me feel self-conscious about what I had ordered.

I was also told by a cuban sandwhich conneissieur that they have an exceptional cuban. Nothing special about the fries or service. I like that the waoter does not brng the food, the chefs hands do. Their water measured at an 90TDS parts per million. This is not awful, but best to be 10 or below. The parking is very accommodating. The place is well conditioned so the temperature is perfect. They have the option for outside or inside seating, although the hostess qas a bit of an airhead. We ordered three cheesecakes to go, they look very promising and well presented. The cookie dough, salted caramel and reeses cup cheescake. They did not offer crayons or coloring for my son, but the waitress was friendly. I thoroughly enjoyed the avocado egg rolls and they were able to conclude that the avocados came from ventura California. This is good. I would give them a 4.5 if I could.

I called, waited on hold for over 20 minutes and they told me they would send me a gift card for the value. I provided my information and they never sent me the card. When I called to follow up three weeks later they told me ""I'm sorry, but we don't send gift cards for incorrect orders."" I was very disappointed when I paid $37 for slices of cheesecake, got the wrong ones, was told it would be corrected, and it never was. I won't go back to this cheesecake factory.

I always sit at the bar because they serve full menu, plus constant service. Who doesn't love that? (And the bartenders are really friendly, especially Ryan)  Downside though: the menu is so overwhelming. I've been going for years and still haven't tasted all the pastas. And the quality of the food doesn't match the prices. The food isn't anything special. But just good.  Mondays - Thursday nights customer service is spot on. Friday-Sunday nights, you'll be lucky to see your waiter at least every 20 minutes. Definitely suggest going earlier during weekends or daytime.

In fact, I didn't think I would leave the restaurant without eating dessert, but the lunch I had today was so filling and delicious that I didn't have room for a sweet, tasty treat. Trying to decide on what to eat is challenging as there are many choices, but when I saw Miso salmon on the lunch menu I had to try it! The whole wheat bread was served as an appetizer while I waited for my meal and truthfully I could have been satisfied with a meal of the bread. Straight from the oven and slathered in butter it was wonderful. The waitress asked if I wanted the lunch or full size meal and I got the lunch size. The miso salmon was served on a round bed of brown rice(my choice...I could have had white), with a creamy white sauce and the miso/teriyaki sauce on top of the good-sized salmon was scrumptious ! If you visit the Cheesecake Factory and have a craving for salmon then definitely try the miso salmon. You won't be disappointed!

Shannon H.,"Brentwood, CA",749,1031,606,4.0,11/23/2011,"I have been to quite a few Cheesecake Factory's over the years and most recently got to check this one out. It was friday after work and it was only about a 15 min wait to be seated. They first offered me a small awkward table next to a large group of people which just felt uncomfortable so, I put in a request for a booth and with in a moment I was seated in a nice large comfy booth perfect for me and my hun. The decor is just as magical and beautifully decorated as all the remaining factory's however, I particularly like this on for it seemed more spacious then others. Anyone that has been to any cheesecake factory knows the menu has quite the selection of items to choose from which can tend to leave you indecisive of what to order. We were given some time and finally made the decision on the Herb Crusted Fillet of Salmon in a creamy lemon sauce with green beans and mashed potato's. I opted for no mashed potato's and just ordered  a little side of mac and cheese. We were given fresh bread and butter while waiting, which I passed on as always. As packed as it was ( as it always is) we still received our meals within a reasonable amount of time.  Large in portion, as part of the signature of the Cheesecake Factory's which also looked pretty appealing. Salmon was cooked perfectly , the sauce was nice however, slightly too lemony for my liking though, the creamy consistency along with the salmon was a great combo. The mac and cheese was nothing special but still quite Delicious. Overall, most Cheesecake factory's food entrees are about a 3 start 4 rating however, the desserts far surpass that. The service we received from our waiter this evening   was  extremely on par, professional and friendly, adding a great deal to our visit and with all the cheesecake factory's that I have visited, I still find the ambiance of the restaurant quite intriguing .

Ron W.,"Raleigh, NC",791,913,5921,4.0,11/1/2009,"I'm not a fan of cheesecake but I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, go figure! And even though I'm a food snob who favors one-off restaurants with a personal touch, the Cheesecake Factory does a fine job of delivering a tasty (and huge) meal in a pretty cool environment.  They're all pretty much the same: high-ceiling, sumptuous space, long waits and huge plates.  But the Walnut Creek location takes it one step further.  Built in the old Andronico's supermarket deep in Walnut Creek Center, you would never guess what it was in its previous life.  Outside there's a patio/lounge area complete with gas fireplace.  Inside it's cavernous with ornate blown glass lighting, gilt gold decor and large columns.  Both a bit retro and roaring 20's, the space feels upscale and unique.   What makes Cheesecake Factory a cool spot for a large group is its broad menu spanning pizzas, pastas, burgers and chicken cooked 2,000 ways.  Food is typically american and italian classics in HUGE portions. But given the prices ($15 - $20/entree), it's no surprise.  We started off with a nice plate of fried calamari in a very light coating.  Nicely done, the calamari was tender and nicely fried, way better than the typical rubber bands you get.  Main course was Chicken Romana: two pan-fried breast fillets coated in a parmesan-romano mix on a large plate of al dente spaghetti.  Simple stuff but again, well-done and delicious.  You might be able to finish the whole plate if you're a sumo wrestler or NFL lineman, otherwise just bring the leftovers home for tomorrow.  As you can guess, we never made it to dessert!   Service was quite good, they train their people well and go above and beyond to keep you happy.  It's a team service so others will jump in to bring you your drinks, meals, etc.  And given the wait was quite short, I was pretty happy and pleased with the whole experience.  Part of me wants to dislike the Cheesecake Factory but every time I come (I've visited the SF, Raleigh and West Palm Beach locations), I go home happy and content, damn you!  So what can I say, I'm not a chain restaurant guy but the Cheesecake Factory does a nice job delivering a mainstream yet upscale dining experience for the family.  If you can avoid the 45 minute wait, it's well worth the effort, bravo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=580
Karen W.,"Pittsburg, CA",36,8,2,1.0,8/2/2014,I have been to this cheese cake restaurant before very beautiful and the service had always been very good except for this one day. My mother and I went for lunch on July 31 2014 and the service was awful. We came in the host were very nice and said the wait would only be about 10 for an outside table. They were right however the 2 waiters that were serving that area neither one acknowledged my mother and I sitting there. I did manage to get one of the waiters attention he said he would get that person for our table but no one came. Now 15min later I got up and told the host that no one came to our table and I would like to be moved. He graciously apologized and said that he would get someone over to our new table to take our order. I ask for a manager when she came out she was very apologetic however offered us nothing for our in convenience. Our new waitress was excellent.

Tara S.,"Hercules, CA",59,17,6,1.0,2/28/2015,"The restaurant is clean and the employees are very nice. We had a few issues on our visit though. I went with my husband and 2 kids.  First issue was us having to ask for our bread when they are supposed to just bring it.  In my waitresses defense she gave us the rundown how tired she was though because she had been there since 7 am going over the new menu. This was around 4pm so I sort of understand her exhaustion.  Second issue I ordered my turkey burger without mushrooms and about 20 minutes after I ordered my waitress very politely told me the mushrooms are cooked into it and they can't leave it out so I need to change my order. I wasn't offered a menu to make a new selection so I had to quickly try to remember something else. Which was the grilled chicken with avacado club.  Third issue my son got his food and realized he ordered fruit not fries and she very kindly brought him his fruit.  Fourth issue my son started to eat and realized that the chicken sliders he had ordered were not what he was eating. Instead he got burgers.  Which he wasn't a big fan of. We were pretty annoyed at that point so decided not to send it back and my son just ate a little bit and left not full.   Fifth issue was when I finally got my plate, after the rest of my family had already been eating for a bit, it was extremely greasy. The bread was soaking wet in grease. The chicken was super chewy and I couldn't even eat it. I did not let me waitress know that I was displeased with the food but was a bit surprised she didn't ask when my whole sandwich sat there as we paid our super overpriced bill. If the food was good than it wouldn't be too overpriced but it wasn't. Our check for the 4 of us was around $70 NOT including tip (which with all that happened we still tipped her 20%) and we didn't leave satisfied at all.

Ariel H.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",0,10,1,2.0,9/5/2015,"I was with a group of coworkers on a night out. I ordered a Caesar salad with chicken and didn't get the chicken. The waitress kept asking us if we wanted water and then left, returning 10 minutes later to ask if we wanted a refill. This repeated 4-5 times. Why ask if we want a drink and then refuse to give us one? Towards the 4th time she asked, she was getting sarcastic and snarky towards us.             At this point, the waitress then ignored us again walking past our table (even though we had our hands raised like kids in school asking a question) and another waiter came and commented about how he 'saw how the waitress ignored us'.           He refilled our drinks, then I asked if it was too late to get a side of chicken. He asked why and I explained I didn't get any even though I ordered it. He offered his apologies, then asked if we'd like to see a manager. I said yes, but the manager never came. BUT I was given a side dish of chicken towards the end of the meal, free of charge. (A negative review all because of chicken? Stupid, I know, but it gets worse)     !!!    This review was only two stars because when I was contemplating getting soup early on in the evening, the spoon I was provided with had dried up bits of pasta severely stuck to it. The spoon itself had spots that were gray and murky.

But ignoring a group of paying customers and asking us if we wanted a refill then forgetting to get us refills multiple times is.. Wow.

As we walk down the corridor I enjoyed the interior and it was beautiful. It was really nice. The ceiling was really high. I really did enjoy the interior as well. The wait to be seated was pretty long. The lady told us 20 minutes but we almost waited an hour. My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday and it was really nice. Once we got seated we were helped by Amanda. She was a great waitress. We started with crab wontons with peanut sauce which was really delicious. I didn't want to eat too much because I didn't want to spoil my appetite for the main dish. The strawberry lemonade was something so sweet and delicious and I never had anything like it before. I ordered the chicken madeira it was really delicious. The only small problem I had with it was that the mushrooms and asparagus weren't cooked to how I usually like them.Very soft and flavorful.

The last visit on 12/12/15 around 10 p.m. was horrible and made me sick to my stomach . We went there and asked for a booth and waited for about 20 minutes which is not bad for a Saturday night. We got a booth which was right next to the exit so every time the door opened we froze to death. We asked them to change the table and they did, so far nothing major and everybody seemed very understanding. We ordered food and we got our food. After eating some of my food I found hair in it. it was almost 6 inches long and white.when the manager came, he did not apologize and instead he was explaining that when they looked at the hair in the kitchen it was blond and they have no one with blond hair working in the kitchen. I got the feeling that he was trying to say that it was my hair which by the way is curly and almost 10 times longer. What really pissed me off was the fact that the one waiters who were serving us where blond and so were quite a few others and the manager was making it look like it is my hair, no apologies , bad attitude like I was a freaking liar. when the waiter brought the bill tossed it on the table and left, not a thank you or good night. My husband and I were so pissed and furious when we left there but since I am pregnant I said screw it i am not going to bother ruining my day for some stupid people who have no clue what customer service is.

Julia D.,"Livermore, CA",79,68,22,4.0,5/5/2014,"The outdoor seating is beautiful. I met a friend there on Sat 05/03/2014, for a late dinner/appetizers and dessert, of course. We spent a great deal of time catching up with one another while the wait staff was great, she would check-in with us to see how we were doing but wasn't overly pushy.  I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese. I have been really good with watching what I eat, but this is my downfall. I knew what I wanted when the restaurant was suggested.  After my friend tried a bite of the Mac and Cheese she ordered her own serving. I told her she would be hooked.  We ended up staying until they closed, but the staff was professional and didn't kick us out, they just began to clean up the outdoor seating area and we got the hint.

I always get to order a different entree since they offer so many different options, and this last Thursday I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken (add mushrooms) and it turned out to be my new favorite entree ever!

The veggie burger was MIA.   We waited and waited to start eating.  I left to the restroom, which took a while, line, came back still no veggie burger.  I asked a waiter to check, he never returned.  When I finally saw our waiter, who by the way did not come back to check on us. I asked him to check on the missing food, again nothing.  Went and asked for a manager and got some trainee with attitude.  When I expressed my disappointment, he laughed at me and told me I had better go sit down.  He too never returned.  The GM finally delivered the incorrect veggie burger.  Fries no salad.  Now all our food is cold, nothing is as advertised.  When I told the GM about the Jr. Manager with attitude, he actually did not seemed concerned.  The entire experience was not up to par with the Cheesecake Factory I am used to.  I have been to many locations inside and outside California.  The manager wrote off the veggie burger and mine, I did not eat it, cold and tasteless.  The chicken and biscuits were terrible, rock hard biscuits, gravy you say???Watery sauce!  Final conclusion, it was not so much that it happened, which was not ideal, it was the attitude and the way it was handled that would prevent me from going back.  Corporate if you are listening, this location needs some attention, seriously.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=600

The server was attentive but not pushy at all and even when another staff member served my bf the wrong food she quickly returned the food and in no time at all brought the correct food.  She was very nice and said to us ""take your time"" which not many servers do.

But thought since the atmosphere is nice I'd try it for lunch once agin.

Ivy R.,"Martinez, CA",137,1779,4674,3.0,7/4/2009,"Since so many of my Yelp friends have reviewed this place, I felt that I should follow along.  Surprisingly enough I agree with them. This is definitely a 3 star place. You walk into one Cheesecake Factory you have walked into them all.  The only thing different I noticed was the large outdoor seating area in the front. It was hot as hell outside when I was there so no one was there. Also, the back entrance is cool, the hallway was like you were about to walk into a fantastic castle that you gay uncle just moved into.  I had the Luau Salad. It was pretty, pretty good. My husband had the Chicken Primavera sandwich. He really enjoyed it but it was just to big to eat. Great leftovers!  We drank a Peach Bellini. It was perfect for such a hot day. I ordered that because I'm reading American Psycho and they were drinking them in the part I was reading. I liked it and am glad I ordered it. I wished I was in Hawaii drinking one.  Their drink menu was kind of disappointing as a whole. Really lame drinks and nothing stood out. That was obvious because our check was like $50. That is a rarity for us at restaurants.  No Cheesecake for us, we just weren't in the mood.  Go on a Sunday because it didn't seem that busy and park in the garage behind the place near the top. Plenty of parking, and it's in the shade.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=600
Yoo Y.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/10/2016,"I was at this cheesecake factory, about a week ago, thinking it is the same as the one in Marin or Top of Macy's Union Square, but what a terrible experience. We waited for 25 minutes to get a table on a Sunday evening and were seated at 8:30 PM at the back of the restaurant, where the service staff was dropping trays on the floor with noise while waiting for a waiter/ress to show and no one came to our table for 15 minutes. Then one server approached after I flagged a few of them, right after I suggested to leave the place, and took drink orders and we ordered a bottle of wine for our table. The server returned  again,  after 10 minutes with the bottle already opened. Requested that the bottle we ordered be open at our table, when the server said he just opened it. The server left to get an unopened bottle to be opened at our table when another server who was helpful and greeted us while waiting for our table, came by with a new bottle, opener, opened the bottle and poured for us and went back to the lounge area that was her station.  Our Server returned and took our order after yet another 15 minutes. He took our order and returned 10 minutes later to tell us that the app we ordered was sold out. I just laughed at how everything was ridiculous and having had a fun birthday all day, I was not going to let the evening be ruined. So we ordered an alternative. He took the rest of our dinner order. One of our dinner order was not done right, but by this point we just decided will pack the food, of course everyone knows the portions, finish our wine and leave, and from my point never return. It was such a place to take a group, but there are plenty other ones a step away to take people  The food was nothing to write about, ordinary, bland.

I know you see them foodstains on the flatware-do you think wrapping it up in a pretty white linen napkin will make your clientele completely oblivious to dirty flatware?!

Jasmine N.,"Benicia, CA",200,30,47,3.0,1/18/2016,"Sure, it's a chain restaurant, and prices can be high for what you get, but sometimes I'm just in the mood for Cheesecake Factory. They have a large menu, from Italian to American to Asian, so it might help to have something in mind beforehand. The ambience is dim and nicely decorated, and it's a big place. There's usually at LEAST a 30-minute wait, although chances are it could be closer to an hour at dinner time on any given week day. I would come here for a special occasion, or a casual meal with one other person so we could sit in the bar area, which is first come first serve. Since the restaurant is pretty much always busy, it seems to take a toll on the food. We had to send multiple dishes back to the kitchen. There was not enough chicken in our sandwich, then when they sent us more chicken, it looked undercooked and was not fully cut through. If your meal comes with sauce, the sauce can be pretty skimpy, so you may want to ask for more on the side. However, our waitress was very patient with us if we weren't happy about something. I do come here regularly, but when planning a meal here, I would definitely factor in the wait time, and expect the food to be hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=640

I went on Saturday night between 7pm-9pm. SERVICE was really SLOWWW!!!It was terrible and I really want to attribute it to the fact that this was a high volume night but on reading other reviews this seems to be a running theme. First it took about a 1/2 hour to get a seat on the patio...that's OK there were packed so that was reasonable. Second I did not love the fact that the only section that has access to any kind of heat is close to the fire pit...everyone else is left to fend for themselves in the cold. Granted nights aren't frigid but it would be nice to have heat lamps throughout the patio to ensure that all your patrons are comfortable when seated outside. It can get breezy and chilly. third it took more that 45 min to get our food and that was after I had to talk to the manager.

Angelica M.,"Oakland, CA",332,139,24,2.0,1/29/2014,I usually don't write many reviews on chains but after 3 pretty bad experiences at this particular CCF I decided to turn here...15 mins after being seated we finally received or water minus the lemon we requested... 10 minutes after still no drinks we ordered...10 additional minutes later my drink and food arrive but no bread. My food was way to hot to eat and my co-worker almost started reheating her food underneath the heating lamp. Poor time management and listening skills is all I can say.

Brandi W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",589,541,625,2.0,6/9/2013,"Well, at least the interior is pretty (in that faux-European/ Vegas casino sort of way). If artificial chic is your thing, you're going to be a happy camper.  The Cheesecake Factory is not exactly a vegan-friendly establishment. The name alone kind of sets the tone for the food you're going to be getting. My mother chose this place, and I reluctantly agreed.  First impression? The hostess was frowning and did not perk up as we walked in the door. Her sour expression made us feel really unwelcome. Strike one.  The place seemed to be full of snobby white folks and their out-of-control toddlers. If you're looking for a peaceful Sunday lunch, this is probably not the place for you. Screaming kids and uptight suburbanites aren't my favorite.  There was only one soup option (nothing vegan). It was a Loaded Baked Potato soup. My mom is on a diet and can't have potatoes. Basically, it was ""NO SOUP FOR YOU!"" Strike two. We took a second look at the gigantic menu. Mi madre opted for the Herb Crusted Salmon entree with asparagus and a salad instead of the mashed taters. She said it was excellent, although the filet was cold. Obviously the waitress had waited too long to deliver it to the table.  I selected the Veggie Burger. It sounded awesome: ""a delicious 'burger' made with brown rice, farro, black beans, fresh beets, and onion"". I ordered mine sans cheese or mayo, with sweet potato fries. The portion of fries was very small, but they were FANTASTIC.  The burger patty was a disappointment. I don't think they grilled it enough, or maybe it was sitting around at the expo counter. It was cold and falling apart. The taste was also bland and mushy. It reminded me of a  Plant Burger, but lacking all the flavor and texture. At least the veggies were fresh: pickles, lettuce, tomato, and red onions.  I should have ordered it off the ""SkinnyLicious menu"" (yes, that's what they call it). It comes with a side salad instead of fries, but it would have been 2 dollars cheaper. If I return, I'll probably go for the Kale Salad and a side of vegetables. That sounds miles above what I had today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=620

We  came in on 9-17-16 about 9:00pm it was pretty busy but we got seated pretty fast. We ordered two appetizers a drink from the bar and two meals. The bar was backed up so we didn't expect it to come out fast. We waited a while for our food our meals came out and still didn't get our appetizers. A little while after our appetizers came out while we were eating our food. At this point our 3 year old was getting by restless due to 1 of the appetizers was for her. Our server asked us if we still wanted our appetizers since our food was out already... of course we do. She didn't offer anything else. Our stuffed mushrooms were over cooked. The fried cheese was cooked perfect. Normally I would have sent the mushrooms back but we were already irritated from waiting so long. Our meals were good but again the whole experience could have been better. This was my first time at this location and it will be my last time. I'll stick to the Arden location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=620

And I am not talking just about the menu, which is huge and has something for everybody for dinner.  No, like a scout evaluating a prospective athlete to recruit, I am talking about the intangibles.  This is your place if.....you like to cozy up by the fireplace! Problem is, it is an open pit, outdoor gas fireplace in the chill of night, with hard benches to sit on.  You will have to wait here to try and keep warm,  because on a Friday night you will wait for 45 minutes just to eat here. (They don't take rezzies!)  This is your place if.....you want to get noticed! Problem is, everyone will notice you while they are wondering how long have you been waiting. And if you walk around inside, everyone will notice you because there is nothing else to do but watch people while you wait. And they will really notice you if you get a table before they do.   This is your place if.....You want a night out with the girls! Problem is, don't expect to meet any guys. You see,  there are a hundred other women in packs of 6 who come here for Cheesecake, while thinking about Beefcake,  but the only beef around here is on their dinner plate. Well, there are some Beefy men, but that is around their belly and they are all here with their families.  This is your place if.....you want to dress up and go out! Problem is, this is the suburbs, so everyone over 30 who lives nearby are in their jeans and jogging suits.  People from farther than 15 miles east or west, well they are wearing their Sunday -go-to-meeting clothes because this is big portions and a fancy night out.  Women under 30 have to compete with the fake ID Teens who think this is the closest thing to Las Vegas, and dress that way.  This is your place if.....you are a player! No problem here! Yep, packs of a half-dozen ladies at a time, trying desperately to be hot and looking for action in the boring, sleepy suburbs, having just finished cheesecake and too many sweet adult beverages, thinking about Beefcake while wobbling in their 5 inch platforms.

The martini was well mixed but was pricier than expected.  I ordered it w/o noticing the price on the menu, if indeed it was there.  The fried zucchini was excellent, crisp and greaseless w/ a ranch dipping sauce.  We all liked it.  Alan liked his pulled pork sandwich and the bite I had of Tam's salmon was very tasty.  My chicken/almond salad sandwich was good, although there was too much mayonnaise and too few almonds for my taste and their idea of a half sandwich was about double what my idea was.  The soup was very tasty and the Caesar salad was bland, lacking notes of garlic or anchovy.  Basically boring.  I think next time I would order the salmon.  Service was warm and attentive.  The space was huge, w/ high ceilings.  Decor was generic glitz.  I had the sense it would look the same in Memphis, Kansas City or Bumfuck Idaho.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=620
John V C.,"San Francisco, CA",125,1,,1.0,12/29/2015,"I have never seen a display of racism that has been displayed tonight. At the The Cheesecake Factory located in Walnut Creek, the manager, who is Asian himself, (update: his name is Jason Shum) just clearly stated that my family and myself are Asian so we all look alike and that is the reason why we were not seated right away.  After we were seated, everything seemed to be normal. We were a table of 14 and when the manager told us that we were Asian and we look alike, he said it to one half of the table, the side where my parents, aunts and uncle, and I were seated at. The other side of the table was unaware till we told them what had happened. My sister, who was on the other side, then complained upon hearing this and the manager was in full denial that he had ever said anything. Later in the evening, the manager then came to our side of the table to check up on us and I told him that we did not appreciate his comments. He then tried to ask us which one of his employees said the comments (seemed like he was ready to throw one of his employees under the bus) and we told him it was him. He then got all defensive and started to argue and deny everything and he would not leave the table, even though we told him to leave several times, he just stood there and said that he never said that and that he has been in the restaurant business for 6 years (pointless to say, but whatever). He eventually left after standing at the edge of our table like an idiot for almost 10 minutes harassing us with his denial while we were trying to finish up our dinner. He clearly had no idea on how to handle the situation. The manager (Jason Shum) is clearly not fit to hold his manager position and should be release due to his incompetence and racism.  Other than the manager's incompetence, this would've been a typical Cheesecake Factory experience, nice services from the servers and good but overpriced food. However the manager ruined the night for my family and myself. I have called and filed a complaint with his senior manager and the corporate and will be following up within the week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=620

I'm fairly familiar with The Cheesecake Factory and have visited several of their branches including their Vegas location. The nearby parking garage guarantees ample parking and makes you want to skip the San Francisco experience at the Macy's building.  The three minute walk to The Factory is refreshing and lets you take in downtown Walnut Creek.  The Spanish style architecture and decor of The Factory is welcoming and nicely suites the restaurant name. I visited the restaurant before seeing a movie on a Sunday night around six or seven o'clock and had a five minute wait.  I got myself a cold Cornoa at the bar and by time I was served my beer, my pager was ringing.  The menu is standard at every location and resembles a short book with pages of American offerings. My party and I ordered their nacho appetizer, which is topped with guacamole, house salsa, sour cream and jalapenos.  The nachos were good, but not great and weren't as fresh as I'd hope.  The chips seemed as if they sat under the heat lamp a little too long. As for my main entree, I went with their Spicy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with fries. The chicken fillet is deep fried with melted cheese, on hamburger buns with lettuce and tomato and slathered with their buffalo sauce. The sandwich wasn't as epic as my previous experiences at their other locations, but did manage to give me a food O.  The fries were pretty standard and served as filler.  All in all, I love The Cheesecake Factory, but I was left a little unimpressed, given this is a new location (two years old).  I'll give The Factory another chance and give this visit the benefit of the doubt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=620

Gabrielle F.,"Lafayette, CA",10,94,22,3.0,2/9/2015,"There's always something new to try and for the most part, I'm always pleased with what I order. (Except for the cheesecake! I'm always disappointed by their cheesecakes.) I ate here the other day. My husband and I split the crab and artichoke dip, which was very good except for the hair in it. And it wasn't a hair that floated out of the ether and landed on top, but a tight black curly hair buried close to the bottom... I'm telling myself it's an arm or chest hair. At first I thought an eyelash had fallen into the dip (maybe, hopefully mine) but when I plucked it out, that little sucker came twisting from the dip, obviously very mixed in. Eeeeeew. We let the waitress know nicely...it wasn't her fault and hair is that evil beast in the kitchen that's hard to keep completely out. It happens. Just wanted to let them know so they could check their dip for possibly more rogue fuzzies. (Why do I always feel guilty for letting a restaurant know about an issue?!) The rest of our meal arrived. I ordered the lunch portion of the salmon genovese and my husband got the chicken sandwich, salad and soup special. Both were very very good. We went home with plenty of leftovers. The portions are out of control huge here which is tough for me because I like trying a little bit of everything rather than eating a mountain of the same thing. The bites menu somewhat satisfies that desire, but I honestly don't come here that often because of the portions.  The two things I don't like about this place would be the indoor dining area and the cheesecakes. I only like eating outside, the interior is boring and makes me feel uncomfortable. Most importantly, somehow, they manage to screw up all of their cheesecakes. The last one I tried was the white chocolate, caramel and macadamia nut cheesecake. It would have been delicious if it weren't for the crust. Imagine a bite of incredible perfection only to get to the bottom where your taste buds are assaulted by a very burnt caramel flavor. Stomach churning. I ate around the rest of the crust but couldn't shake that burnt flavor. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. I would hope the quality control on cheesecakes would be better since that's the name of the chain. Alas, no.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=620

Sometimes they don't allow reservations, though. On a busy weekend night you will be waiting at least 30 minutes, unless you are fortunate and finds seating on the bar area, which I find the floors to be really really slippery, idk about you. It's fun to look at all the waiters/tress' white shoes. Some of their shoes are sooo filthy, I though they were donated or something. But they say that it just gets dirty in the kitchen. Really? Because it looks like you just climbed off Mount Diablo. Lol.  Anyway, for lunch my favorite is Kobe beef burger. For dinner, everything is good, and I usually stick with the pastas. I've been here with 2 people, and with 16 people. The service is always great, they are so friendly and funny here. They greet you, try to make small talks with you, nothing is awkward or pretentious here. I really really love the decor of this Cheesecake factory. The huge pillars, tall ceiling, intricate lighting. Very cute outside eating/hanging out area, large fire!! is so romantic.  The food always come in humongous portions, or maybe it's just the plates. Eitherway, free bread, of course, a little on the tough side for me. Pasta is always good here. Prices are expensive, though, but it never stops so many people of all ages from coming here. This place is always loud, and even with all this space, They could use more tables. One downside is the small bathrooms. But usually it's clean, so that's positive.

You take a sip from that oversized plastic tube-of-a-drink, with the words, ""Imperial Palace"" plastered on the side (you know, the drink that others doubt you can finish without getting alcohol poisoning.

The Louisiana style chicken pasta is to die for if you like a small kick to your otherwise decadent entree.  Skinnylishess Menu I have also had a lot of experience with the Skinnylishess menu (under 520 calories, right?) from the enchiladas to the turkey club. Overall, I have not been impressed with that menu, although I'm probably asking for too much. It's like ordering the vegetarian option a a steak house. Just done do it. They tried. So to be specific, I was not a fan of the enchiladas (it may be a matter of preference, mine being green sauce over red) but the vegetables on the side (zucchini, cauliflower and carrots) were not cooked and made to serve cold in vinegar. It was utterly inedible! It's not even bunny food worthy! Next time I will ask for streamed till soft vegetables. Problem solved!  I love this place for too many other reasons to give up on it! To stay on the safe side, I would just suggest ordering off the regular menu and taking the other half home! Noteworthy Plates Appetizers: Spinach Artichoke Dip with chips! Heavenly!

JMark P.,"Napa, CA",3,53,,3.0,11/27/2012,"I own a business so I try to be fair.  To run a restaurant and then have lay people (especially teens and some 20 somethings who probably should not be reviewing a business) acting like they are Pulitzer prize winners all the while being ""food experts"" commenting on their restaurants must be hard to swallow.  Again, I try to be fair and I don't try to nitpick.  I've worked in fine dining as a waiter and went to chef school so I have a little knowledge.  That said: Remember that if a restaurant isn't busy, usually the food isn't good.  This place always seems busy. I've gone there several times.  The service is very friendly.  Twice I got the curbside to go order and it was fast and convenient.   The curbside take out is awesome.  You can call the bakery and order your meals and then park for free in the garage next to the restaurant and they will come out and bring your food to you.  They will take your money, get your change and you are on your way.  If you carry cash you can pay the bill immediately and I always add a couple of dollars as a tip.  I remember they were training someone and they were very sweet and informative.  I really appreciated their speed and great attitudes!   Sometimes when it gets real busy, service anywhere can be a little rough.  It's hard sometimes for staff to deal with the diva/high maintenance mentality of some people in today's world.   One time I was eating at the bar on a Friday after work, and man was it packed.  They also had someone out sick and they were training someone.  I read the room and told the waitress not to stress about me and just do her best.  I sat at the bar and got a couple of cold Guinness while she dealt with 2 tables of drunk crazy college aged people that were making her life hell.   The meal was late but I understood.  As I left the restaurant the manager stopped me and gave me a piece of cheesecake to go on the house.  The waitress was so appreciative and said I made her night.  Sometimes not being a hot head and showing patience does pay off.   The food is mostly solid.  To not have a regular bacon cheeseburger is kind of silly but for the most part the food is good.   People think a huge menu is a good thing but it's the exact opposite.  It shows a restaurant trying to be all things to all people and that usually spells disaster.  I've tasted the pasta dishes, pizzas and the asian wraps and they were bland and ordinary tasting.  No chef can cook a great meal every time with so many items on the menu.  I'm one of the few I think that doesn't like the desserts too much.  To me they are sickening sweet.  I make cheesecakes and I cant' imagine the amount of sugar that is in these recipes.  Many like them though so I'm a rare person.  Pros: Solid food nice staff love the cheeseburger and the appetizers are good too Curbside take out Cons: Very swamped on weekends so you will have to wait a long time Menu is too big; some items are hit and miss  Parking is a big pain at times.   For a chain restaurant it's not bad.  Out of all the ones I've been to, this one so far is the best Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=660
Paula G.,"Concord, CA",234,58,110,2.0,12/8/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory has declined slightly since my last review.  The bread that was brought out was slightly burnt, not to mention stale.  Thankfully, our waiter was very gracious and immediately brought us a new basket. Food quality...meh.  It's a chain restaurant, so I shouldn't be expecting something super fabulous or over-the-top amazing. But the boyfriend was craving their BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad...and I wanted cheesecake. Had a late lunch here with the boyfriend and we both ordered salads and cheesecake to share.  We couldn't finish our salads (because we need ample stomach room for cheesecake obviously) so we had them boxed up to go.  Later in the day, we decided to finish our leftovers and had found that we had been totally gypped!  I know for a fact that I had finished a little less than half of my salad (likewise for the bf) and the amount left in each to go container was only a quarter of each salad...if that!  If we're going to pay $10+ for a salad, we expect to get our money's worth...even if we have to take home leftovers!

We started off with avocado egg rolls, which I have never had before, but am certainly a fan now. I want to personally thank who ever invented these. I ordered the Blue Cheese BLT burger. It was OK.

With that, I asked the waiter, ""what kind of juice do you have?""  and he replied, ""DO YOU NOT HAVE A MENU?"" We'll that just set me off. I then replied ""do you not know what kind of juice you have at this restaurant?  I went on to correct him even further and we were able to move on and have dinner---but HE TOTALLY RUINED THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY FEELING...   as this turned out to be the talk at the table.

Daniele handled herself in a very professional matter & even got them the manager. They moved to another table (thankfully lol) & we heard eventually just left. Daniele took our picture for us & gave us a ice cream with candles with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate syrup on the dish dish. Way cool as I was not expecting this.

Brittany G.,"Elk Grove, CA",26,39,1,2.0,11/24/2012,"I've been here about 5 times over the last 3 years... only one time (the first time) did I ever have a truly great experience. The drinks were excellent, food was great, service great... but ever since it has just gone downhill. Granted the first time my best friend and I went it was relatively slow in comparison to its normal level, but we had a great time. I'm so sad to have to give this place 2 stars... but the last experiences have just pushed it over the edge... One thing you must know is that this place is busy... ALL.THE.TIME. I have gone at almost every hour of he day... and it has always been super busy (the exception being the first time). you ALWAYS have to wait. I really hate when places say 15-20 minutes... then you wait 45... and after the 45 minute wait they sit you outside at 9pm when its 55 degrees outside and put you no where near the fire pit... (like it would really help anyway since the wind was blowing the heat in the opposite direction) Brrrr! what good do heaters 10 feet over your head do when its your toesies that are freezing off!? This last time was just another reason not to go here again... no bread was given or even offered until i asked about it (if it had been my first time i wouldn't have even know to ask for it!!!!)... and that was only after we received our drinks and needed refills... there were four of us (we were starving) so the bread didn't last long... I asked for a bread refill along with our third drink refill... and then we ordered... granted the food came pretty quickly but the appetizer came with the entree's...  There was hardly any sauce on the pizza... so while we were eating we asked for extra marinara sauce... my boyfriends sister was waiting for the sauce to eat her pizza... and our server just kept walking by that table not even looking to see the status of our meal... his sister sat there and watched us all eat while munching on fries, helpless while she waited for her marinara... finally our server came back after everyone else had already finished to take our plates. seemed like she didn't even care or apologize that she forgot it... my boyfriends sister was just sitting there with an entire plate of food while ours was all gone....  I just ended up telling her to give us the sauce to go...and she gave us this teeny tiny cup with no more then a tablespoon of sauce what a joke!  so my boyfriends sister watched us all eat... to get this sad amount of sauce?! it was barley enough to pour over one slice!!! The server was super inattentive, she would walk all around avoiding eye contact so we couldn't get her attention. I guess I'm the picky one... my boyfriend and his family are just happy to get food... but for me? when we spend 97 dollars of our hard earned money on a LUNCH for 4 people... i expect a little better.  the food is usually tasty and the restaurant is absolutely beautiful but this is the 4th time i have been treated like crap here. The worst is how expensive it is, I don't mind paying for an expensive dinner/lunch if i get great service... but we work close to minimum wage while paying our way through college... $100 lunch is an entire 10 hour shift for us!!!!  totally unacceptable...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=680

The desserts stand out a bit, but overall, food is expensive and the same as everything else out there that is a chain. Went for a girls night before crossing the street to see SATC 2 and had SUCH a fun waiter...wish I could remember his name...some adorable gay guy who called us all by character names and was great at refilling and ordering and recommending the many specialty drinks we kept throwing at it. And did not complain when we had to split the bill a million different weird ways, which goes a loooong way in my book. So that was a good experience. Have had a night at the bar there for a few drinks, crowded, but fun, efficient. Spent a lazy happy hour on the porch, it is a great location for people watching, and our server was very gracious about refilling wine and not minding that we didn't order any food at all!

Steve R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,31,2,2.0,7/18/2016,"I have never been a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory as I find it very canned and over-done. The food while serviceable, seems to border on coming out of a big bucket with just enough alteration to make it appear hand-made. That notwithstanding, my frustration with CF begins well before the dinner. In celebration of a birthday and the need to get in an early dinner, we called for a reservation for 11 people at 5:00pm out on the patio (on a Thursday). We arrive at 5 pm and are told that 80% of our party needs to be before we can be seated but our table is ready. 5:10pm and all our party arrives. We let them know we are all here and they say it will be just moment. A moment turns into 25 mins and we still have not gotten seated. We ask the host to ""speed it up, lets go"" and he replies ""your server will be here in 2 mins to seat you, but not all your party was here at 5"". 2 mins turn into 10mins. At this point, the host essentially lied and more exasperating is; the patio is essentially empty with seats galore to chose from. Two members of our party go over to where one wait staff is trying to put the table together (oh wait so it wasn't ready?), at which point we begin putting the tables together with him and begin setting our own table. We sit down. You'd thought we just told them the earth was flat, because they had no idea what to do now. They weren't able to generate that goofy little computer seating receipt and the waiter was unable to follow the CF's inane seating policy. Why is it, they can take a reservation, but they actually can't execute on the reservation? The table wasn't set at 5:30pm let alone 5:00pm. This is CF's SOP though. Come in, tables vacant everywhere and wait for 10-15 minutes. In our case 45 mins for something that should be as easy as making Cheesecake. 5:00 reservation = table ready with 11 seats and flatware, napkins etc. Everyone in our party was disappointed with their very rookie, second-rate, bush-league attitude. The food was OK... it has gotten incredibly bland though and cafeteria-esque - I would move on from CF. There are many, many other restaurants in WC to choose from.

Tamara E.,"Walnut Creek, CA",56,2,,1.0,2/16/2015,"I went here for my cousins birthday last night and we had horrible service from beginning to end! I've noticed the last couple times I've been here, the service has tremendously gone down hill. Honestly I don't even know why I go back.  First, we were being seated to our table and the hostess realized that our table had been given to someone else so we had to wait another 10 min for the first available table. Next, we were seated and our table for 4 was missing a chair and had no place settings in which we had to ask for. Our sever came over and took our drink order and at that time we were figuring out what appetizers we wanted to get and because we were taking too long to decide he decided to leave us to let us further decide and get our drink orders. (20 min later)  So he comes back with our drinks and we decide to put in our dinner order with the appetizer because we didn't want to wait any longer to eat. So one of our appetizers comes out. My mom specifically ordered salmon rolls and they brought out shrimp rolls. She is allergic to shellfish. Thank god she didn't bite into it. Our entree maybe came out in  another 20-25 after that. Our server never came to check on us to see how our food was. He was practically non existent all night. Two couples had ate and gone next to us before we were even presented with our meal. I can go on and on. I was so livid I went to talk to the manager and was offered free cheesecake or an entree taken off my bill. The manager and waiter argued their points instead of just apologizing and consoling us. When they came out to sing happy birthday to my cousin they didn't even bring her a spoon for her sundae. Until the very end the waiter kept bringing back the check without running my step dad's card so we had to send the check back 3 times to settle the bill. We spent 2 hours in a restaurant mostly sitting and waiting. This was beyond ridiculous! At least the food was good. I understand restaurants can be busy but there is no excuse for not attending to your guests and dropping the ball.

My all time favorite cheesecake is Chris's Outrageous cheesecake...this flavor is to die for. So sinfully delicious.  I usually go to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco in the Union Square area. I like it because its at the top of Macy's, which is my favorite department store. I have only been to the Walnut Creek location once and it is decorated the same inside as the one in SF.  For a chain restaurant, I have never been disappointed with The Cheesecake Factory. I never had a meal on their menu that I did not like. I try to order something different each time I go. The only downside is that their food is high in calories, carbs and fat. I think that is why they do not display how many calories are in each item on their menu. For this reason, I only occasionally eat at The Cheesecake Factory. An average of 3 times per year. Their prices are not cheap but not expensive either. Everything in my opinion is reasonable priced. In addtion, I have always been satisfied with the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=700
Steven D.,"Concord, CA",11,3,,1.0,8/13/2015,"If I could post a review without giving a star, I would.  We came here to celebrate my son's 21st birthday, arrived at 6:30 on a Thursday evening.  Front desk staff told us the wait would be about an hour and 45 minutes.  We decided to wait - bad decision.      Despite being told that our table was ready (they were waiting for the prior party to leave), we still were waiting at 9:00.  After repeated complaints to the front desk staff without response, we finally sought out the manager.  He had a lukewarm at best response, and seemed unaware that we had been waiting over 2.5 hours.  Finally we were seated at 9:15.  During our wait, we had to be proactive in asking about the status of our table, we offered suggestions to split our group to two tables, had to ask for water for my 85 year old in-laws, and finally had to get their manager involved.  We asked for menus while waiting, so we could save time while finally seated.  Never were offered any of these suggestions by the staff.  Once seated at 9:15, we told the waiter that we're ready to order.  It's now 9:30, and he hasn't returned to take our order.  I'd write a review about their food, but God only knows when that will be here.  I don't write many reviews, and have only submitted positive reviews when I do write one.  I asked the manager for his card, finally brought one back after 20 minutes.  He didn't have his business cards on him.  His name is Paul McDaniel.  Said he would assist with out table.  Brought one glass of water, then disappeared.  I strongly advise - avoid this place.  Poor and seemingly indifferent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=700
Ashley N.,"Novato, CA",88,17,1,1.0,8/31/2012,"Nice outdoor patio where we sat that had a nice fire pit and great architecture and design. So everything was nice to look at. The food was okay, but definitely not worth the amount I paid.  That being said here comes the important information. First of all, our waiter was very demanding. He did not know the words please or thank you. He would say ""you better show me your I.D."" or ""give me your cup."" That's minus points for unprofessional and rude customer service. He also got some of our orders wrong. One person in our party didn't get her meal and had to reorder. My boyfriend didn't get his drinks that he ordered and also had to reorder. Secondly, we ordered mimosas and they brought us a bottle of champagne and two plastic cups of fresh squeezed orange juice (including all the pulp). They expected us to pour these big plastic cups of orange juice into slender champagne glasses. WTF? They said they didn't own any carafes or pitchers. The server tried to be considerate and pour the glasses for us, only to spill half of the orange juice in the plants near our seating area.  Lastly, we had a large group and were billed automatic gratuity which was understandable. So, we split the bill between our group. Some paid with cash and some paid with credit card. When the people who paid with credit card got their individual receipts to sign, the receipt had a tip amount already printed. BUT why would we pay tip if gratuity was already included in our bill?????? So we crossed out that extra tip that was printed on our receipts and wrote the amount we intended to pay. A few days later I check my credit card statement and they charged me that extra tip that I had crossed out!! (Extra tip that the server definitely did not deserve). Everyone in our group that used a credit card were charged extra tip as well. I disputed the charge and the credit card company resolved it.  But that was the last straw. You can screw up my food, spill my drinks, but you never mess with my money! haha SO BEWARE OF EXTRA CHARGES.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=700

Stacy C.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",11,142,49,2.0,9/26/2012,"So, I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory. Everyone told me that I should, but it seemed too trendy and overpriced for me. Last night I finally gave in and went... and found that it was too trendy and overpriced for me, with the addition of staff making everything totally awkward. There were four of us. We were starving. We ordered three appetizers. Waiter comes back about 15 minutes later to take our order (4 dinner salads, a burger, 2 filets, and a ""new chicken dish you'll love"").  He explains how he's new here and that the last table he had was AWFUL. ""They wanted everything SPECIAL, and ugh, they were GREEK, too."" Then he asked if we wanted refills on our drinks, and made us chug the remaining soda in our glasses. Really. Complete with the ""Chug! Chug! Chug!"" chanting, and ""Come on, you can do better than that!"" encouragement. I am totally serious. Server comes over 10 minutes later with our salads.  Wait... our salads? Shouldn't our apps come first? Hmmm. I guess the kitchen must be backed up. The salad was meh. Mixed greens (waiter said it would be baby lettuce) that were wilted, bitter, and contained one leaf that I am sure came from a philodendron. (But their ranch dressing is awesome. Enough of it made me forget about the icky greens.) So, 10 minutes after we finished our salads, our entrees came out. Wait... our entrees? Shouldn't our apps come first? We look at the waiter and ask where our apps are. Man... if I could bottle the look of horror on his face, I would make gazillions around Halloween. He says, ""Uh, your appet... oh God. Oh God! That is totally my fault. I am so sorry. I forgot them."" Forgot them at the counter? No... forgot to turn in the ticket. Dude. You have ONE job to do. And it isn't a hard job... you ask people what they want to eat, you tell the cooks what the people want to eat, and you bring the people what they want to eat after the cook has cooked it. And shit, at Cheesecake Factory the waiter doesn't even have to bring out the food! So, yeah. No apps for us. Our entrees? Overpriced and unspectacular. The burger was undercooked, the filets were overcooked, the chicken dish was missing ingredients. It would have been a fine meal if it was half the price. The manager came over when we were 2/3 through with our meals and asked if we'd like our appetizers. I really had to tell him that they were supposed to be APPETIZERS, not DESSERTS. To top it off, the manager offered us each free cheesecake to make up for his waiter's incompetence, so we each ordered a slice to go. Then the tab comes, and he had only comp'ed 2 slices. Great, add another $15 to the ridiculously overpriced meal. Awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=700

The architecture is astounding and it really is a beautiful restaurant. We had to wait a few minutes but that was no big deal. Very friendly hostess and staff overall.  Our waiter, Trevor, was also great.  We ordered the crab & spinach dip as an appetizer, I got the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes, and sauteed spinach instead of the asparagus. The boy got the jumbo shrimp/steak diane combo. Now here's the BAD PART....they forgot our appetizer! We waited at least 30 minutes (which is a long time, but considering it was my bday and I was with my love, I just enjoyed being able to spend some time with him) to get our entrees, and when Trevor brought us our dishes I asked about the crab & artichoke dip. He apologized and took it off of our bill, since we didn't want it anymore.  Another NOT SO GREAT thing is that before we ordered our food, we ordered piña coladas. They cost $10 each which is fine, but they had barely ANY alcohol in it! I drank my entire one on an empty stomach and didn't even catch the slightest buzz! Oh well. It still tasted great.  Our entrees were delicious. Very decadent and filling, even my bottomless pit boyfriend had to take some home for later. Even the next day the leftovers were great.  When we asked for our check, Trevor was nice enough to get us a slice of complementary cheesecake, since they forgot our appetizer. We got the dark chocolate/coconut cake and it was DELISH.  After we paid with the giftcard and cash, we waited to get our change back but never did.

Rachelle R.,"Concord, CA",0,19,2,2.0,12/5/2014,"My two friends and I dined at Cheesecake Factory tonight in honor of my friend's birthday. We arrived there around 7:20 and told the guy at the front desk that we would sit either inside or the patio. A few minutes later we noticed a table open in the patio area and mentioned to the same guy at the front that we would rather sit outside. He explained that we were next in line and that we would be called shortly. About 15-20 minutes later we received the text that a table was ready. We waited for about 5-7 minutes for the three-four young people at the front to stop chatting with each other and seat us. We were in the process of being led to our seats inside when I mentioned that we were waiting for seating outside. The girl said the wait would be another 5-20 minutes. At this point all three of us felt that we had waited enough. The manager (Mike) overheard us complaining and came over. He said that there had been a mis-communication as the guy upfront thought that we had asked for seating inside. I explained I had informed the person upfront that we wanted patio seating and that he was aware of this. The manager walked away and apparently rolled his eyes. We took the inside seating after a 40 min wait.  I was upset at that point because the manager did not apologize or offer us a free drink or dessert. The customer service from the server was excellent; the manager definitely needs some training. After telling our server that we expected a free dessert at least for the birthday girl, she received an extremely small slice of cake. We asked if this was the regular size and the server looked really uncomfortable and didn't reply. Altogether the experience was great because I was in good company. The food and drinks were great.

Al C.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",96,325,90,3.0,10/24/2010,"Came here for lunch one day.  Seems about on par with every other Cheesecake Factory that I've been to: decent food, OK prices, pretty good service.  The good thing about this particular location was that it was pretty dead during lunch and we were able to get seated quickly. The salmon salad I had was OK.  I was expecting a warm, grilled salmon fillet next to a plate of greens, but got a dead cold fillet with a bunch of green stuff mashed on top.  Guess I should have read the description a bit more before ordering.  I do have to say that it wasn't bad for what it was.  The portion was a healthy size, so overall, quite a success.

It had likely been wiped with a cloth that was too wet. As I looked more, I could see bits of wet food on the table also. I took my cloth napkin and attempted to dry the table. Looking at the napkin really revealed how gross the table was. We left. Obviously, the table should have been properly cleaned to begin with, but it is also disappointing that the hostess did not even look to check that she was seating us at a decent table.

Heather D.,"San Jose, CA",122,48,1,4.0,7/3/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my go to spots in Walnut Creek. It's not nearly as expensive as most places that think a fancy name and a high price mean good food, which is a common occurrence in this area.  Starting with their cheesecake, I mean jeez. There are so many and they are a meal and a half by themselves, the half being all the whipped cream they slather on that bad boy. Anyway, I've tried many different types on any given Friday night with my friends and a cocktail. One slice easily feeds 2-3 people. So far the Red Velvet Cheesecake has stolen my heart.  Onto the food! The portions are monumental which I can appreciate given the slightly above average price tag. The menu is the size of a bible so choosing is never easy. One thing that bugs me is the Sunday Brunch menu, so many goodies and ONLY available on Sunday in a small time frame. That being said, I wasn't aware the first time I set my eyes on the Steak & Eggs. I ordered it with a grin and was met with an awkward...ummmm...it's Thursday sort of look. The waiter disappeared and back he came wearing the look a like, a smile. They made it for me anyway and it was orgasmic. Big props to that waiter and cook! Most of their food is pretty tasty and you'll always have Dinner 2 later with all the leftovers you bring home.  On to the service! You know, for as packed as this place gets, the service ain't so bad. Yes, it can be slow but the environment is so nice I tend not to care. Plus I haven't met a waiter yet that totally blew it on my order which tends to be picky. I guess in short, if you are in a rush, save it for a day with more time, otherwise get your hungry ass here already!  I give this 4 stars only because things can get slow and this place sort of wins by default when it comes to food choices given there aren't too many places that really knock it out of the park in good ole WC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=760

My only complaint was that I felt like I was about to fall on my face over how slick the floors felt, and other people in my group agreed that the whole restaurant had a very unsafe walking area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=780
Tamara A.,"Concord, CA",12,11,5,2.0,2/6/2012,"We waited 2hrs for a table which was 30 mins longer than we were told. When we went to the waitstaff and asked how much longer, they acted as if they had already seated us but we were standing in front of them. They looked at their chart and then back at me and said, we have table that is just about ready for you. We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which was fine but as our friends 3 yr old climbed into the booth she slipped and hit her head. The waitress just stood there. No offer of ""would you like ice or a cold pack"", or even ""is she ok"" or ""the tile can be slippery"". Maybe I am just asking for too much but read on as the evening get's better.  We began to order appetizers for the adults and food for the 3yr old. (PS don't keep a 3yr old hungry) Things seems to be getting better and we ordered our dinner.  The waitress came back about 5mins later and said they were out of ahi tuna. My husband ordered the ahi salad, which is what he was craving for dinner so we went to the Cheesecake Factory since it was one of the only ones he likes (except at BJ's).  So back to the menu but before he placed his order our waitress left to see what else off the ""healthy"" menu was also not available. When she came back, we played the are you out of this? game.  The evening continued to be ok but instead of a nice evening with friends, it was so late when we finally left the restaurant we were too tired and all went home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=780

Emily J.,"Concord, CA",380,1294,166,3.0,10/9/2009,"I'm always hesitant to visit The Cheesecake Factory.  I think it is because I always expect a four hour wait.   My honey and I stopped here on our way back from an overnight trip to Berkeley for Yelp Prom ( ).  Parking: Not a problem!  There are a few parking garages nearby.   Wait: None.  We were there just around 1 on a Saturday and were seated immediately.   Food: I got one of the lunch specials. It was a half sandwich, soup and salad.  I only got through the soup and salad before I was full.  The salad wasn't very memorable. The chicken and artichoke soup was really tasty.  A little bit creamy with other veggies including carrots and peas.  I ate the sandwich when I got home and it was a pretty standard chicken salad.  I did like the sliced almonds added to the mix. Service: Our waiter was nice but everything seems to take a little longer than usual at The Cheesecake Factory...even when they aren't very busy. I think the serving sizes here are pretty ridiculous.  I rarely get their cheesecake because I can rarely make it through my meal.  Everything's bigger at The Cheesecake Factory.  Did The Cheesecake Factory start in Texas?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=780

LOCATION: Downtown Walnut Creek...intersection of Locust St & Olympic Blvd. Public free parking garage in same block, else street ""metered"" parking. Restaurant size (as previously reviewed) larger than Pleasanton & SF locations; roomy, spacious, clean, & welcoming to folks of all sizes & very handicap friendly.

Jack points out CF has added a new menu-page to their ""booklet of food"" called ""Small Plates & Snacks"" (Lordy!). Cooks did a great job on food, & overall atmosphere of service was on point. Keep up the great work team ;-)   TASTES: So Sher K & I really just wanted to utilize our coupon spend $30 & get free a free Cheesecake. Thinking we'd just share some appetizers, she picked out the perfect item...the ""Factory Appetizer Favorites"" for $28, which was 4 appetizer plates. Plate 1: Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes & Quesadilla Plate 2: Shrimp Summer Rolls, & Spinach N Cheese Dip Plate 3: Avocado Egg Rolls & Fried Calamari Plate 4: Pork & Chicken Pot Stickers *GET THESE* Everything was enjoyable & more than fullfilling; yes we asked for 2 carry out containers *tee-hee*. Only thing not really tasty to me was the Avocado Egg Rolls...U have to love avocado to enjoy this; next time I'll ask if we can substitute them for the Southwestern Egg Rolls *yummy*.  FINAL TAB: Cost us like $34 & change for 1 ice tea & 1 app (""Factory Appetizer Favorites""). Everything tasted gets a recommendation w/ the exception of the Avocado Egg Rolls.

I told my server and she rolled her eyes...I dunno if it was toward me or to the chef that made my food either way I was NOT happy.  I was expecting that she would take it off the bill since I took like two bites.but no I had to pay for the meal that got me itchy and sick!

Tammy D.,"Antioch, CA",174,61,8,4.0,12/18/2011,"I love the non-generic look of this particular location, smack dab in the heart of Walnut Creek's gourmet ghetto.  For a chain restaurant, it's elegant, clean, and pretty classy. Service was exceptional and nearly all the wait staff with whom I had contact were young, energetic, and smiling. Our waitress, Hailey, went out of her way to make sure my friend and I were enjoying my special birthday outing.  Being familiar with the outrageous Cheesecake Factory portions, we wisely decided to split a meal.   Comfort food was the order of the evening and we chose the meat loaf, with mashed potatoes, and veggies.  The meat loaf was exactly the way I like it: not too tomatoey so that you could actually taste the flavor of the meat.  Mashed potatoes were piled up and drenched in a home style brown gravy that reminded me of my grandma's. Splitting the meal allowed us room for a slice of macadamia/caramel cheesecake, which was fabulous.   A nice touch was when Hailey rounded up a couple other servers and they sang happy birthday to me.   I had been feeling a little blue that day, but the cheerful, warm atmosphere and home cooking at the CF made me feel so much better. The only down side to the whole place, in my opinion, is that the ladies' room is incredibly small (obviously designed by men, lol!)  Several times during the evening, I noticed a line outside the ladies' room.  When I went myself, I felt claustrophic.  They should have known better than to build such a large restaurant and skimp on the ladies facilities.  We gals NEED restroom and sink space!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=780

It just can take toooooo long. I find that people wait more than eating the food. Plus on top of that the menu is more of a novel than a menu. It's like Cheesecake Factory is having a hard time picking a corner of the market so they put everything on the menu. It makes it hard when your hungry and all your other friends are looking at you.  Finally this place has no privacy. Yes I understand that it is a public place. but the space is too open.

We got there around 7pm. I'll admit my fault cause it was Valentines Day and people we being crazy. All the curb side parking spots were taken, so we had to park a little further down into the Valet parking area. We called in and told them we were outside.  We waited about five minutes before a car finally left and we got a parking spot. We waited another 10 minutes. Then some old guy in a Lexus pulls in behind us. This lady in a brown top and purple under shirt came over to him and asked him if he was picking up an order. She told him to go park in one of the handicap spots and she got his food! I was pissed. I was there for 15 minutes and nothing and he just pulls up and gets his food?  I called again to tell them I was out front. Again another 15 minutes go by. At this point I am SUPER pissed. My boyfriend convinces me to go inside and get it myself.  I go inside and go to the front counter. Of course no 'real' line just people standing around like zombies. I tell the guy, ""I have been out there for 25 minutes at curb side and waiting!"" He plainly goes, ""All curb side orders have to go to the bakery and they will help you."" Mind you it Valentines Day and the line is SUPER long. Three cash registers and only ONE open! What the hell. Took them 10 minutes for each person to get them a SLICE of cake. I waited in line for another 10 minutes. Line only moves up once!  My boyfriend calls me and tells me they are finally outside with my food. I don't think I have ever been this mad waiting to get a curb side pick up before. My boyfriend told me he almost went off on the lady cause of how long we waited and how others got served before us. I felt sorry for the server kid who had to deal with me. I know it wasn't his fault he was just a server. No tip, of course. We get home. The food was COLD and SOGGY. The slice of red velvet cake we had ordered, the cream had gotten so warm and soft that the cake started to sink into itself.

Lisa L.,"San Jose, CA",69,61,15,2.0,8/8/2011,"The Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory is pretty decent but if you've been to one Cheesecake, you've been to them all. The décor is fairly similar to the other locations I've been to (Palo Alto and Valley Fair, mostly) and the menu doesn't vary. Personally, I don't think the menus need to change since they're so extensive and one can usually find something to order, no matter how picky the eater. I LOVE the Chicken Bellagio and order it pretty much every time I visit a CF. However, when my Mom and I went on July 23rd, I can't say the same. The pasta was incredibly dry and almost hard- like it had been sitting out, drying, and someone splashed water on it, trying to reconstitute it before serving it. The flavor of the dish was good but when the pasta is the best part, it's disappointing to not be happy with the quality of it. The chicken itself was cooked nicely and breaded to perfection.  Though I can't remember our Server's name, I can say that he was awesome and did everything he could to put a smile on my face, as well as my Mom (who was there celebrating her birthday). He was friendly, attentive, knew when to inquire as to how our food was/if we needed anything, and when not to. I'd come back to this location for his customer service, if nothing else.  Best part of the meal: when we mentioned to the Hostess and our Server that we had a movie to get to in less than an hour, they pushed us through to accommodate our request. I was impressed with how efficient the service was and amazingly enough, we made it to our movie 15 minutes early (which was good since the theater filled up so quickly). All in all, it was the same status quo experience you expect from CF but they missed the mark on my pasta.

The restuarant is much more beautiful in comparison to the SF and Sacramento Cheesecake Factory locations. The decor is amazing and makes you appreciate lighting and mirrors. The food has been very good each time I've went. I have no complaints with their menu items. I really do try to order new things each time I go. The dessert is very good. You just have to be in the mood to eat sweet. The Red Velvet cheesecake is one of my classic favorites. The pecan pumpkin cheesecake is super good for those who enjoy pumpkin and/or sweet potato pies! The carrot cake cheesecake..well, after you eat this one, you'll end up in your dentist's chair not too soon after (it's way too sweet).  The Salmon dishes are always one of my faves. Their pizzas are OK. Their pasta is good and filling. Their crab wontons (appetizer) are very good. The crab/artichoke dip (appetizer) is the bomb! Their fruit smoothies taste fresh and refreshing.

Deanna J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",67,93,3,3.0,9/8/2011,The three stars is an average between a couple of  times I was a patron: On 9/3 - 4 STARS - I got roped into coming to this place again. This time I was prepared...I brought a book to read while waiting. However; Gabrielle was our server this time and the experience was anything but awful. Redeemed! Gabrielle is a stellar waitress! She made our experience wonderful. She was attentive and VERY friendly. My BF even took the time to compliment her on her outstanding customer service (which I had never seen him do before). If only all restaurants could have a server like Gabrielle! :) On 8/29 -  1 STAR (for Perry's assistant) - The service (meaning the service Perry provided) is horrid with the exception of Perry's helper.

The firepits have nice ambiance, but the actual drinks?  If you don't order vodka on the rocks, or bottled beer, and you get something they mix, you may just want to stay home. Seriously, I think they throw in pretend chocolate  syrup dripping with high fructose GMO laden evilness, with fake non-dairy-whipped-something-masquerading-as-cream along with rot gut liquor, and you have yourself whatever it is that they are pawning off as drinks.  Think you can't go wrong with salads?  Think again.  Yes, this is chain food.  Middle America?  Maybe.

(Noticed another table in this spotlight also requested to be moved) The food was good but the service from our waiter was not too great. Everything was very slow. We wanted to change an item on our order 5 min after we put it in and he said ""no, it's too late"" and didn't want to try to ask. When we got our food, no one offered to give us fresh pepper and Parmesan. We asked the girl from the kitchen who was very quick to get it for us. The next table also had to ask for it. Then we realized, halfway into our meal, that he never brought the bread. That's one of my favorite things here. I looked around and the tables. One had bread, one didn't.

My hiking friends each got a salad and I decided on the Avocado Eggrolls appetizer.  Just right and still brought some home...along with a slice of fresh banana cheesecake to share with my daughter tomorrow.

Emily D.,"Oakland, CA",290,117,248,3.0,5/27/2012,"So this is your standard Cheesecake Factory. Grandiose architecture done at a medium taste level. The food is like any other Cheesecake - large portions, varying degrees of quality, excellent but calorie-rich cheesecakes.  This particular branch appears to be extremely popular, with a perpetual crowd of people in the surrounding areas all holding their reservation beepers with eager looks on their faces. It can be tough getting a table at any time of day here. Given how busy they are, I can't say I'm surprised their service is lacking, but it's still aggravating. Last time I came here it took ten minutes for our waiter to bring out a glass of sangria for my friend, and no one came to check on us throughout our meal until we were almost finished. It's tough getting any server's attention as they're running around the tables so quickly and aren't looking up. It's especially difficult outside when it gets dark as their dim lighting causes a drastic decrease in visibility.  Their restrooms are almost like a joke - just a few stalls in the women's restroom, and 2 sinks? I don't know how they can expect that to accommodate all patrons in the restaurant. I've walked away from the restroom after waiting 5 minutes behind 3 people. The location is perfect. It's located in the building where Andronico's used to be, right across the street from the Century theatre and located just a block away from Broadway Plaza. There are a few parking garages in the immediate area, and some street parking, but parking can still be next to impossible on the weekend, especially Friday evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=800

Unfortunately for my daughter, her meal was inedible. Her fettuccine was doughy and the chicken undercooked. I called to let the manager know because paying $55 for 2 meals - 1 of which went uneaten, warranted a call into the manager. I spoke with Rafael who offered for me to pick up another dish - no thank you (this would pose a huge inconvenience). He then offered me a GC and placed me on a 20 minute hold. The wait was so long that I had to hang up and call back. To my surprise, Rafael was there at the front desk. I realized he either has a very bad short term memory and forgot that he placed a customer on hold OR he wasn't pleased with having to make the situation right. In any case, I WILL NOT ever be back. His poor excuse for the hold was that he didn't have a pen/paper to take down my information. I think a trip to Staples would have been quicker than my hold time. Please take my advice - don't eat here.

Soooo disappointed! That was my first below average meal from there and I was quite sad. Not at all what I expected.  It's ok though, I had room for cheesecake. I went out on a limb and trusted the waitresses suggestion to get the mango/key lime and it was wonderful!!  The Avocado egg rolls are always amazing!!

Believe it or not, I attended my 30th reunion on the 20th.  Come to find out that my girl Penny who coordinated the whole event is leaving on tuesday and moving to the ATL (moving to bigger and better things, can't hate!).  Anyway, Ms. Linda calls up and announces that we all have to get together to send our girl off in style.   With the help of that wonder website FaceBook, Linda rounds up 20 of us and makes arrangements at CF.   We had this whole section roped off for us and they were even very understanding when a bunch of us were late because of the traffic.  We had two waiters that took care of all our needs and they split our checks about 8 different ways  (too cool).  Ms. Penny lost her balloon bouquet and the manager, hopped on top of the banquette and used a stick to coax them down! So let's get down to my eats - #1 - I have to have diet soda because of the diabetes, no problem there.  I have to have caffeine free because of the PKD, problem.  Brought my own diet 7-up and they provided the ice and glass and no drama!  Yeah! #2 - Appetizers - Chicken pot stickers - They were pretty yum, but there were only 6 of them and they were in the sauce already.  Kinda pricey and they were ok.  The wrapper was nice and thin.  That was a plus. Dates stuffed with goat cheese, wrapped with bacon.  - These were on the ""little menu"" and had a little price.  The concept was very good, but the execution wasn't perfect.  a tad bit on the dry side. #3 Entree - Shrimp Scampi with Steak Diane - I asked for medium and it was medium and perfect and delicious.  Mmmmm - Served with rustic mashed potatoes. Honey Bunny - Thai Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - I got two thumbs up when I asked, but he didn't stop eating to give any details.  There wasn't a drop of food left on his plate, that must mean something. #4 - Chocolate Coconut Cheesecake - Honey Bunny said it was great.  Funny thing, I'm not a cheesecake fan.  (LOL) This was a wonderful experience, much better than the one at Union Square!  Glad I had a chance to have a second opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=800

One of my friends had already arrived and put our name in for a table.  They do not take reservations and you will be lucky to be quoted anything less than an hour. I have come to know, accept and embrace that whenever I agree to dine here. The Cheesecake Factory is not a good place for: A first date. An intimate conversation. A quick meal. *High heels. *I don't know what it is.  Every single one I've been into.  They All have the most slippery floors on earth.  I don't know if they mop with Pledge or what. The Cheesecake Factory is good for: Certain dishes. Eating a lot. Overly priced but good Cheesecake. Testing for central auditory processing disorders. The specials can be hit or miss.  A lot of their regular menu items can be hit or miss. Stick with the Steak Diane, Chicken Piccata, Fish & Chips, Popcorn Shrimp, Chinese Chicken Salad and the Raspberry Lemon cheesecake is incredible. Stay away from the artichoke appetizer, fried macaroni & cheese (you do NOT want to know the grams of fat in that baby), Teriyaki, Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, Salmon. On my last visit here, my husband and I both ordered a glass of wine.  When the server brought them out, my glass was 1/2 full and his was 3/4 full.  Fail! So not cool. They take on too much.  It's just the way it is.  The bar, cheesecake and food departments are all separate.  If you order a drink, your server has to go order it from someone else and wait in that line of orders.  The same goes for the cheesecake.  We were done and ready to leave 25 minutes before we were finally handed our dessert to go and our check. Time management just is not a priority here and I'm positive it has everything to do with their consistently lengthy  ""wait for a table list"".

Eugene B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",57,17,,4.0,5/30/2014,"I've been waiting for my wife for 2.5 months in California and finally she's here. This place was our first date in this area. I wanted some dessert, she wanted a salad, we both wanted a nice romantic place - so we've decided to try this one. Location is nice, we've found a parking space without any problems, although there was not many of them. Probably we just got lucky. Area with outdoors table is looking cool, like some resort-area restaurant somewhere in Southern Europe, like Turkey (it's Asia actually but who cares) or Bulgaria. These fountains with fire are really exciting. Inside... Well it's not so romantic. Interior is not bad, every table with seats are looking pretty good but not extraordinary. It's pretty loud there and organization of tables in this area isn't really intimate. So the place and feeling was good in general but not excellent. Main disadvantage - it's really loud there. If you want intimate date, either sit outside or go to other place. We expected European-sized food so we were thinking about ordering 2 salads and 2 desserts. Luckily we've decided to give it a try at first. My wife ordered traditional Ceasar + cappuccino, and I've order 30-years anniversary cheese cake with some caramel moccaccino. Well... The portions were huge! We've been eating ceasar together and still weren't possible to finish it. Salad was good, chicken and croutons also were good (but we'd expect a bit more of them), cheese was.. Hardly noticable - there was really small amount of cheese. I had a feeling that smth is missing - either cherry tomatoes or eggs. Beverages were just not bad, but not awesome. They didn't cause any negative reaction but we weren't excited. The cheesecake - well thi is smth that was really good. It was so big that we couldn't eat even a half of it. And really tasty.

Nathan V.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/12/2012,"This rating and review is NOT about the restaurant as a whole.  It is about the single performance of one waiter at the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek.  The waiter is named Miguel, and he is by far one of the best waiters I have had the pleasure of dining with.  I work in food service training and I often take the opportunity to keep a waiter or waitress on their toes - no matter where I dine. So, what did he do?  Well, first I must explain what his supporting staff did not do...  Dinner was delivered with mistakes in side dishes, entree ingredients, and although additional condiments were requested - the requests were not honored.     Miguel bent over backwards, running back and forth, collecting missing side dishes, providing additional condiments, and even replacing bent silverware.  All the time I pressed this guy harder and harder (because that's what I do for a living) and not only did he correct a mass of chaos that he did not create, he did it despite my ever increasing disapproval.  What's really impressive?  He never lost his composure, or his sense of diligence, and he maintained the integrity of our dining experience. Now, like I said, I pressed this guy hard enough to make him want me to leave and never come back.  This is what Miguel said to me when we were leaving, ""Please ask for me next time you come in so that they can seat you in a place where I can serve you.""

I usually get some Farfalle Garlic Pasta that for some reason I order even though I know I didn't like it before. Anyway, this dish was tasty -- not too thick, filling, and the asparagus and shiitake mushrooms were cooked well. The only thing is the portion size is smaller than what you'd expect at Cheesecake. Normally, I'd have half my dish left for another meal the day after, and this time it was maybe a quarter left. But I'm just being picky. Usually I get the Godiva Cheesecake, which is amazing.

The little crab cakes are freakin amazing! I also sampled plates of my family members and those were awesome too! The bang bang shrimp is excellent! The second time I went I got the dynamite shrimp with their sauce(no idea what it is) and the two together were such an amazing combo! The fillet mignon is really worth the price, only $30! Other places, you'd be paying like $40! Then comes the whole reason why I came here! The cheesecakes! They are big and bursting with flavor, like everything else in this restraunt! The first time I went, I got the 30th anniversary cake and that was awesome, especially for leftovers! The second time I went, I got the Hershey smores edition and that was the best cheesecake I have ever had in my life! The meals here are honestly not that expensive! For four people at the table for my birthday, we only played $121, which is not bad for all of the food here bursting with flavor! Another thing I like about this place is the service! Since I work at Safeway, I set the bar pretty low for people giving me service because I am told everyday to give quality service, which these guys are too! Both times, the waiter and waitress were so nice and they gave us really good menu suggestions! The filled the water every time and we got our food with no screw ups(All I care about)!

I poured the small cup of bbq sauce onto my burger. it was smokey and sweet. In general the burger was pretty delicious, a bit heavy but hey it's a burger, right?! I got a side of ranch and that topped it off. The fries were way TOO SALTY! I ended up not even eating them.  -- Lemon raspberry cheesecake: I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but this one was pretty good. My GF says its not as ""cheesecakey"" because it has some regular cake baked in. The raspberry sauce is pretty tangy and offers a contrast to the fresh lemon taste.  Defintely a very positive experience here. The $40 bill was normal considering everything we ate and it was satisfying. No complaints here, glad to have had a good date on a Friday night :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=840

So Finally, after much pleading,  My husband and I stopped by for lunch yesterday.   I marched happily up to the hostess and she told me that there would be a 20 minute wait.  Not bad for a busy Friday.  My husband and I waited outside next to the cute waterfall with a small firepit on top.  The 20 minutes passed quicker than I expected and we were brought to our seats in their outside patio.   It was Freezing outside but I was fine with it.  Our waitress, greeted us and took our order.   My husband asked for hot water to keep us warm and bread to satisfy our hunger before our entrees arrived.  Like others experienced, we waited forever for our drinks and bread.  Our entrees arrived before our water, bread did.  It was poor service but our waitress apologized for taking so long.  Whatev... I was OK with it since our food was there and I was happy. My husband however, wasn't as forgiving.   The food was good - I usually order the Miso Salmon which is yummy!  And I topped it off with the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake.   I will be back but will probably wait a few more months until the staff settles in and gets it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=840

We actually got paged within 15 minutes, so we carried our drinks over to our table.   We were lucky enough to get a table outside right next to the fountain.   Can I say that they did some kickass job in interior design to turn what was an Andronico's into the much celebrated (by me, anyhow) opulent restaurant chain?!?   The ceiling inside looks absolutely stunning.  The only surprising thing, actually, was that they didn't opt to take the whole space left vacant by Andronico's.   I'm certain they could have easily filled it!   Who knows?  Perhaps a staffing issue... Anyhow, back at our table, the waitress was extremely friendly.  In fact, my wife remarked our spectacular that all the staff, despite the fact that this was their opening weekend, was so smiling and friendly.  Having opened restaurants herself, she said that's quite rare...  We ordered all kinds of foods:  Fried macaroni & cheese, Buffalo Blasts, Chicken Sliders with fries, and the Sheperd's pie.   In between the chaos, I managed to sneek in another Martini that got me nicely buzzed... Who can go wrong with 2 martini lunches, right?   Our food eventually arrived and, while it certainly took a little while, all of our dishes were absolutely gorgeous and we, of course, had much too much food that we ended up with 4 to-go boxes.   Perfect, we thought...

Tiffany C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,32,,1.0,3/27/2011,"1 star is pretty drastic considering I came in here fully prepared to give 5, and considering the hype plus the fact that this place is always packed. One star for the friendly hostesses and reasonable wait, and maybe a half star for the beautiful interior.  The service was abysmal for the amount we paid. Not a single ""How's the food?"" or ""Anything else I can get you guys?"" during our meal. Seriously?! I get paid more attention to at a fucking Denny's. In fact, the only time we were graced with our server's rare and precious presence was when he dropped our food off and when we got the bill. I could understand if I was with a big party and things were hard to keep track of, but it was just the two of us: one appetizer, one entree to split. We had to flag down three different people  to get more bread.  The hibachi steak was okay but really generically ""Asian"" tasting and extemely salty, kind of reminiscent of Panda Express. It also arrived without a steak knife so we made do with the butter ones. The size of the portion for the sweet potato fries was good, but we had exactly two spears of fried asparagus for the other side.  As for atmosphere, yes, it's beautiful. I didn't mind the low lighting and I loved the hanging glass lamps and murals. But there was only one word that came to mind ambiance-wise: CACOPHONOUS. Babies crying. Dishes clattering. Beyonce blaring. The preteen girl at the table next to us shrieking incomprehensibly. Mind you, I love the chatter of happy families and laughter at restaurants. But my ears are still ringing. It might just be the architecture of the building, but I haven't expierenced something like that since being in my high school cafeteria.

For example the buffalo wings, and fried shrimp. The fried calamari was decent, virgin strawberry daiquiri tasted good, and our cheesecake topped with strawberry and whipped was fantastic.

On the menu, under the heading ""On The Rocks"" was a Ruby Red Sunrise drink, which we ordered since we like our drinks on the rocks. I noticed the female bartender (light hair, pony-tail, large frame) starting to blend some drinks and I said to my husband, she's blending our drinks. When she served us the drinks, I said, we ordered our drinks over the rocks. She gave us a very rude glare and grabbed the drinks and said, they are flash blended. I said, but they are supposed to be on the rocks, that's what the menu says, correct? She rudely started to make new drinks, when I said, don't worry about it, we'll take the drinks, she rudely said, I already started making you new drinks. I insisted it was okay, because I felt so bad that she was so visually bothered by this. She gave us the original drinks back.  The drink was really good, but, be sure to tell them you want it on the rocks, because the menu does not say flash blended.

The food is warm at best, not piping hot (whereas the SF atop Macys location, the plates actually burn your hand if your not careful). After a few bites I generally dont want more and there has never been a time anyone in our group including myself, has been eager to box and take home left overs, which is strange since we usually like taking home Cheesecake factory leftovers.  I've tested this theory. I went with my sister to the SF location a couple days after frequenting the Walnut creek location and big difference.

Robin L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",610,613,154,4.0,3/23/2009,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory this past Friday night right in the middle of primetime.  Wait was quoted at 75-90 minutes, which I thought was pretty good for a brand new restaurant on a weekend evening.  My bad for telling the hostess we'd take  the first available table.  We ended up at a lovely but FREEZING table on the patio's outer edge.  After trying to warm up with alcohol, we gave up and asked to be moved to a patio table closer to the building, where the heat lamps high above, would help us weather the cold. --Freeze frame or like Evie on Out of this world, stop time--  When we asked to get moved to a different section I was expecting at the very least a disapproving look.  However the hostess and the server were so nice about it; it was really no big deal and even the hostess helped carry our stuff over to the other table. Okay, resume (unfreeze time).... Meal was excellent (Cheesecake Factory food is so consistent isn't it?), service was great and they even sang happy birthday to my friend who to protect the innocent, I will name ""Matilda"" (Betty D.). The restaurant itself is so pretty and all new, so the ambience is lovely rounding out the dining experience. All in all, really nice WC Cheesecake Factory experience.  I know, I know, it's a chain, but like Starbucks, not all Cheescake Factory's are created equal.  This one, like the Pleasanton one, is doing things right. NOTE to WC Cheesecake Factory Management if you're reading: Those tables on the outer edge wouldn't require patrons to wear snow gear with a small adjustment or two?  Standing patio heaters for just those tables or some sort of a wind barrier would probably take care of it--the heaters are just too high to combat the wind chill along those tables",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=900

Food quality is spotty- sometimes good sometimes blah or portion size ebb and flow.  (Tetaki Salad for example- sometimes 4 slices of tuna, sometimes 8 or 9).  Testimony of bad management/ quality control! Service has just been consistantly awful for the past few years at many locations but certainly the Walnut Creek location.  They really seem to hire people who don't know anything about waiting tables, juggling all the details and demands, and people who have no sense of time management.  They really need to evaluate their hiring practices and certainly look into spending more on training!  They consistently deliver slow, aloof, inattentive service over and over.  Testimony of bad management and training development!

Kristen S.,"Oakland, CA",292,158,123,3.0,11/24/2012,"For me, the Cheesecake Factory has a nostalgia factor to it that leads me to eat here  - it is the place that my family went to on special occasions or when we wanted massive amounts of food that would last us for multiple meals. In other words, Cheesecake Factory was a special treat. Unfortunately, Cheesecake Factory no longer has that appeal for me so the only thing that brings me back is to recreate some of that nostalgia. This Cheesecake Factory, as with most others, was super packed, although the wait time for 2 was less than 40min so that was pretty good. The food is usually always well-executed and tastes good, especially for the amount of people that come in. Unfortunately, my dining partner's pork chop was overcooked (this is the reason why I always hesitate to order pork chop at a restaurant like Cheesecake Factory in which they specialize more in foods that can be easily executed and sent out quickly) and the sauce was a bit too sweet. I ordered my go-to favorite  - the gumbo. While the taste was okay, it was a bit too oily and greasy after a while. When it arrived it looked like someone had thrown it all over the plate - presentation was super sloppy. I also found a stray ziti within the rice, which led me to speculate about what else could have accidentally fallen into my food...The appetizer was good though - the buffalo blasts are my absolute favorite! Biting into crunchy pieces of chicken with buffalo juice already mixed in with the meat - delicious! Unfortunately this wasn't the best Cheesecake Factory experience I've had, but for how many people it serves, the food is surprisingly consistent. We ended up opting out of the cheesecake, which for me is actually pretty common - I usually never get cheesecake because I fill up too much on the delicious wheat bread, appetizers even before I reach my entree.

Ashley M.,"Austin, TX",154,57,25,2.0,6/6/2010,"The short version: You're better off getting takeout if you're craving this place. DO NOT go here if you have a large party.  Long version: I used to always love going to the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square in SF. Yes, it's a chain and there's always a wait but the food is pretty good and I always have a good time. I've been to the the Walnut Creek location twice now and I've left disappointed on both occasions. The food is just ok and the wait staff is always nice but their problem is with their hosts/hostesses. The first time I went the hostess sat us right away (less than 15 min wait) and apparently didn't tell the wait staff. After almost 20 minutes a waitress walked by and asked us if we'd been helped yet. We said ""no"" and she apologized and said none of the hosts/hostesses had informed her we were in her section.  I decided to go to this same location again for a birthday dinner with friends. I called ahead to try to put my name in since I had 12 people in my party, but they do not take reservations. They informed me I should come early to put my name in and tell my party to arrive later. I showed up over an hour before I told my friends to arrive so I could get my name in and we wouldn't all have to wait. When I said I had a large party the host got his manager and they put my name in the system. I said they would be arriving in over a hour and I came early to get us spot (like they had informed me to do on the phone.) At that time the ENTIRE bar area was empty and nearly every table was open. She said that wasn't a problem and to come speak to her when my party arrived and they would seat us. Score! After waiting in the lobby for over an hour all my friends show up to help me celebrate my bday. I tell the hostess manager my party had arrived, she looked at me like she forgot who I even was. Then she said she'd take a look around and get back to me on how long the wait would be. She came back 5 min later and said it would be over another hour before getting seating. EXCUSE ME, WHAT? Did the conversation we had an hour prior even happen??? My entire group was upset and the hostess manager didn't do ANYTHING to try to alleviate the situation. She basically blew us off. I immediately started calling near by restaurants to see if anyone could fit us in... everywhere else now had over an hour wait too so we just stayed at Cheesecake Factory.  Another hour and a half later we finally got a table! Every other restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life (whether it's fast food or a 5-star restaurant) has given me something when they've screwed up and Cheesecake Factory didn't do anything to help us. A freaking piece of cheesecake would have been nice or even an ""I'm sorry"". :( Not going back to this location again. I recommend getting takeout if you absolutely have to have CF!

I'm not really a fan of desserts and I don't order the normal stuff, but I hear their entrees are good. However, I can tell you that their weight management meal options taste pretty good...which probably means you shouldn't eat the entire thing if you're watching your weight.

The outdoor seating areas are particularly good for large groups or cocktails.  Service - My waitress (Jennifer) was truely fantastic. I've also never been to a Cheesteak Factory that had particularly bad service. So props there.  Cocktails - Quite good. I had a BlackJack Martini and whoever decided blackberries should make friends with Jack Daniels was a very very smart individual. I also ahd the Pink Lemonade and it was quite tasting.  Food - Eh. First, I echo others' feeling that a menu the size of a novel does not encourage me. I do not need nor want that many options. Just show me what you do well so I'm sure to get something delicious.  We had the Tex-Mex eggrolls to start and they had a nice flavor and were well executed but did not blow me away. I had a special which was a pasta dish with lightly batter fried chicken, prusciutto, baby arugula, and a white sauce. The baby arugula was perfectly sized for biteability (I having to cut apart arugula when it is used in a non-salad dish because the pieces are too big). But all in all, the flavors were fine, but simply ordinary.  This is only my third visit to a Cheesecake Factory (the other two were at the one on Union Square in Frisco), but I have never been blown away by the flavor profiles. It's a step up from Chile's or Applebee's, but for the price, I'd rather go to a local joint that might not have the same level of ambiance, but is more likely to show me something new and fantastic in the cuisine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=900

Because the restaraunt is so nice, and I love the ambiance I decided to sweep that one under the rug. #2.  Second visit was September 27, 2010, my birthday.  Again everything was fine until we opened up the silverware...DIRTY again but this time food crumbs were in the napkin as well as the bottom of the water glasses.  When we told the waiter he just gave us new silverware and a new water glasses.  He never apologized, or tried to restore our confidence in eating there.  He obviously didn't care, right?? So that's it for the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek, perfect example of judging the book by it's cover.     And another thing, the waiters wear all white from head to toe.  You would think they would set a standard on the cleanliness of the shoes.  Because some of the waiters dingy, busted tennis shoes threw off the clean look.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=880

I was pissed off the whole time but still had to place an order because my family really wanted cheesecake for the christmas party.  After getting over it, understanding that it is christmas eve, we went to pick up the cake. Well, we got there and apparently they don't have the cake that we ordered. Guy told me he took it out from the freezer when I was on the phone because it takes about and hour and a half for it to defrost. I'm not sure how they lost the cake.

Daryll G.,"Mountain House, CA",2,148,8,3.0,1/12/2011,"I've been here a few times and I'm torn about how many stars this place actually deserves.  Let's start with the good. This is the Cheesecake Factory of your dreams. The ones in San Jose are just BLAH. nothing special about them. This location has outdoor seating areas where you can wait 45+mins for a table during dinner hours. The interior is amazing. From the lights down to the stone floors, wood paneling, mosaics, water fountains with fire coming out of it, ceiling fans and space heaters.  The service? It's so-so. Nothing extraordinary. I don't expect too much, simply because this is a huge restaurant, but I do expect a refill for both drinks and bread. The last time we went, we asked for more bread. The server came back and told us that she would bring it out as soon as the next batch was out of the oven. 40 mins later, our meal is over, and she brings us the check and places it next to an empty glass of water. So much for bread. So much for service. But again, not expecting much, it's a big location, but that's no excuse to not refill a beverage.  The servings? HUGE. Worth the price and the wait.

Some honest questions for the horrible servers at this place.  1.You see two people seated at a table. No menus, no drinks... whst do you think maybe you should do? 2.You see two people and only one set of silverware.. waht do you think you should do? 3. You take their drink order. 30 minutes later you see they still don't have their drinks... mybe stop haning out over by the pos and grab the drinks sitting at the bar? 4. You take their food order and they request a couple appetizers... maybe bring out two small plates and a second set of silverware for the two people? 5. It's now 10:30 and you see that these are teh only two people left in the bar, their napkin (the one they were given) is covering their plate, their glasses are empty, and they are talking to another server... maybe ask them what they need instead of getting mad at the other server for paoching your table? (yes we heard you whining like a lil bisnatch) We literslly stopped in to get a drink and some crab cakes while we waited for my parents to finish their movie.

Gigi A.,"Livermore, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/18/2015,"ATTENTION: For those who are gluten free due to Celiac Disease!!! Beware of The Cheesecake Factories! had a celebratory dinner with friends last night at the Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory.  While the service was excellent and everyone said their food was delicious, I had a bad experience. I have Celiac and HAVE to avoid all sources of gluten or I become ill.  Half way through my ""Angel Hair Shrimp"" pasta entree, which arrived with spiral noodles, I found spaghetti noodles in the mix.  Rather than make a scene and send it back (I had already waited 10 minutes longer than anyone else at the table of 7) I just stopped eating.  We also had to leave for our awards event. There was no time to wait 1/2 hour for another entree. At checkout, I asked the waitress to please alert the cook to this problem.  She said she would, was sorry, and offered to bring me another meal.  That was that!  No contact by a manager or supervisor.  $17.95 for 6 shrimp was a price meal. I have been to other restaurants and had real concern and understanding of the issue with Celiac form the servers and cooks.  Either Cheesecake Factory management doesn't understand the really health concerns and consequences of those who truly can't consume gluten, thinking it is a personal choice and not a medical issue, or they really don't care!  I won't be eating at any Cheesecake Factory again.  My physical pain this am, confirms that I had gluten last night! I think the Cheesecake Factory needs to seriously step up their game with regards to cross contamination. Either that, or take the Gluten Free symbols off their menus and be honest about their food prep practices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=920

Cheesecake is a great drink and appetizer spot, I would only suggest dinner out of convenience or perhaps with a large party because the menu is so extensive, there is something for everyone. They get four stars because the happy hour menu is mah-vuh-lus!  Happy hour is from 4p-6p, Monday-Friday, and the happy hour menu is almost as vast as the regular menu. I didn't notice any item on the happy hour menu over 5 bucks. We had the avocado egg rolls, one of my favorites, velvety avocado with a sweet and tangy tamarind dipping sauce. Next on deck was the chicken samosas, a spicy curried trip to India, yum! The stuffed mushrooms are served in a flavorful wine sauce. Hmmm let's see, what was next? At $5 per item we took full advantage. Oh yes, the fried artichokes, there was a slight glitch with those, be careful there are two on the menu.

The wait at the WC location has generally been very short.  I'm not sure if it's because it's newer or because they just get through people quickly.  I have heard that the WC location is the largest cheesecake factory by far.  Supposedly, it's because the person who owns the factory is from WC and wanted to make this the largest location.  So maybe we're lucky enough this happened because I generally don't wait more than 20 min on a Saturday night.  That's great since I've waited up to 3 hrs at the Union Square location.   As for the food, I think I'm starting to get sick of the food here.  I have branched out and tried some new dishes such as the spicy crispy beef, steak diane in addition to my favorite - the cajun jambalaya.   Recently, I've ordered to go on a number of occasions.  I've been disappointed with the quality of the food when I get to-go.  For some reason, it just doesn't taste as fresh.  So my advice is that if you eat at the Factory, eat there and not to go as you will regret it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=920

We were finally sat for dinner - outside.  It was cold and we were told the heaters were turned up as far as they could go.  Oh well, I was starving and wasn't about to ask for another table.  We ordered 3 apps which were all yummy.  Stuffed mushrooms, popcorn shrimp and avocado eggrolls.  No complaints about any of them.

The drawback is that you can't make a reservation...which just bothers me about this chain in general.  But the curbside pick up is a special feature that makes up for waiting for a table sometimes.  The decor is standard for their chain and it's tastefully done.  I like that even though it's packed...the booths feel private and you can enjoy your meal and still have a great conversation. The food is okay.  It's not supposed to be the most adventerous or cutting edge menu ever, but you can find something that you'll be happy with.  They took away my favorite salad and I'm still pouting about that...

Then they gave me the bill after I sat there for an hour while they remade it correctly and they had not even given me a break on the bill..

Extremely disappointed, I was craving a chicken di panna =\. 12/16/10 Can't believe I have yet to review this place after going here for so many times. If you think this Cheesecake Factory has really fancy architecture and designs uhhh...they're pretty much all like this. The food is ok, kinda expensive and can get really busy but it's a fun place to hang out with friends and family.  I always get their Chicken di Pana! That is delicious. The flat iron steak is pretty ehhh. As for the cheesecakes...MMMM! I want some Red Velvet Cheesecake now. This place gets 3 stars for look and feel, service and the fact that some of these dishes are awesome. A lot are kind of a hit or miss though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=940
Kent J.,"Danville, CA",51,79,271,4.0,3/26/2010,"Which way is the casino?  Vegas, that's how I feel about the interior.  I actually love Vegas, so take that comment as you will. Here's the deal.  I ALWAYS sit at the bar.  The service is above average if not great, thus an easy 4 stars for service. I notice many reviewer complaints about the lengthy menu.  I never complain about options.  Also, I read complaints about large portion size.  Again, have some self control.  They are giving you value.  Take the leftovers home or leave them behind.  From my experience, the food has ALWAYS been consistent.  Better than your average restaurant but not amazing.  Try the Miso Salmon.  3.5 to 4 stars for food, and I'm not a hater, so 4!

Joe N.,"Antioch, CA",220,406,213,3.0,12/8/2010,"This is the 4th time I have gone to the Cheesecake factory and every time I have been, it has been a nice experience. I love the decor and how big the place is, the food is usually fantastic, a good value for what you pay and the service is usually really nice and friendly.  Last night was nice but a little bit of a different experience than I have been use to. We were seated very quickly with minimal waiting. When we were seated, we were kind of placed in a corner, compared with being in the middle, which is nice I suppose. I had a few issues. First of all the table we were seated in was right up against a wall and extremely cramped for someone my size at 6' 6""......they probably should have seated us at a larger place. I felt very confined and cramped. Another major problem was that after 10-15 minutes of sitting there, I had to ask for someone to help us. It took forever to get our drinks and bread and it just made the experience a little bit of a bummer. Once we got someone to come help us, it was a little better, although we did get our appetizer and entree at the same time, which is taboo for such a nice place. Decent server after the fact of forgetting us at the beginning.  Out of the 4 times, this was the least favored time as far as the wait time and having to ask for help. I will still go there in the future....... but am not so excited as I was before. Good thing I had great company or this experience would have been a total bust!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=940

Closer than if we parked in the public garage. Then we walked in and asked for a table and were told it would be 25 minutes. Only 10 minutes later we were being directed to our table. Unfortunately, they thought ""table"" was code for booth. We said we'd wait for a table to open up but before we even got to the front they found us a table. We both ordered the flat iron steak. Each came a little more rare than we ordered but were otherwise quite good, juicy, firm without being tough. A little on the pricey side but it was balanced by the great waitress we had. Attentive without hovering she made sure we were well taken care of. The only real downside to the evening was how insanely loud this place was. Half the time I was mouth reading as we were trying to have a conversation but I'm a terrible mouth reader so I was constantly asking her to repeat herself.

A wait can usually be expected, and upon walking up to the restaurant it looked pretty busy considering that it was already after lunch hours.  But I was surprised that our wait was only 20 minutes! For chain restaurants like this, the food is usually consistent, so to me service is the main factor... The hostesses were friendly.  The guy who seated us was friendly.  And our server (Kenneth W.) was great!  He was friendly while taking our orders and answering our questions about the specials.  He also brought us everything that we asked for during our meal, including one of their menus that my uncle had asked if he could take home.  Our server was nice enough to ask the management (and without the kind of attitude that you'd experience at other establishments).  He was also pretty easy-going and joked around with us throughout his service.  So, thanks guy... My mom had a nice birthday lunch! As for the food... Huge portions (okay for family-style), enough to compliment the prices of the dishes.  My personal favorites:  AVOCADO EGGROLLS and SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES for appetizers, and CHICKEN MARSALA & MUSHROOMS as a main dish.  Other dishes we ordered today were the SHRIMP FRANCHESE, CHICKEN BELLAGIO, and PECAN CRUSTED CATFISH...

If you're going to blow $100 on dinner I want it to be worth every penny.  A chain restaurant doesn't come in mind when I think of this. So we got a gift card and that's why we went.  We requested outdoor seating. When you enter the décor and structure is great but it's LOUD!! I felt like I was shouting to my husband while waiting for our table (3 minutes on a early Sat evening). The patio seating is the place to sit, alittle street noise but not to bad. Plus they have alot of heaters so the temperature is great. Food: Holy Crap it actually tasted really good.  Appetizer: We ordered Ahi TarTare it was very good just wish it had alittle bit more kick but other than that it was perfect, fresh and light. Entree: I ordered the Weight management grilled chicken and was very surprised. The portion was HUGE. Three chicken breasts served with steamed rice, asparagus topped with arugula and some seasoning. It was mouth watering and very flavorful. Drinks: Okay this area gets a 1 star for the simple fact is a mojito costs $10!!! Yes $10!!! The last time I spent that much for a drink was in Hawaii but that included a beautiful view and ocean breeze. Also you couldn't taste any rum. BOO! Cheesecake: What can I say, it was AMAZING!!! I ordered the Kahlua Coffee while the hubby ordered the Tiramisu. Yum! Yum! Yum! My only regret was I didn't order another slice to bring home.

Well, I never went out on dates, so I am sorry to say I've never been to the Cheesecake Factory before today. And, this Walnut Creek location definitely makes me want to go back.  The parking garage takes you to the back door of the restaurant--that's door to door service! The menu reads like Bronte -- a voluminous novel telling the story of food. Ahhh, the poetry and majesty, that is, the Cheesecake Factory menu. I haven't seen a menu this large since the one at Elephant Bar. There are food offerings from just about every ethnicity.   I started my lunch off with a cocktail, a passion fruit Mo-ji-to (imagine Brian from Family Guy on ""The Bachelor..."" it was excellent. Then my friend and I ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer. Usually calamari is overcooked and really tough, then you pray for extra dipping sauce. However, this calamari was very tender. I felt bad about eating so much. Then came the main entrees: I had the mahi mahi fish tacos. They came served with a side of black beans and seasoned rice, with salsa and Guacamole for the tacos. As if that weren't enough, I had the nerve to order a slice of cheesecake. Hey! I wanted the whole experience, get it? I ordered the lemon raspberry cheesecake. So delicious.  Our waitress was great. She was very attentive to our table, and we were never at a loss for water!  Now I'm as bloated as a tick, but my first Cheesecake Factory experience was so great the sickness I am experiencing now is definitely worth it!

However, it's a safe place to dine when you're dining out with 3 people who can't agree what they want to eat, and no one wants to make an executive decision.  It's also a good place to eat if you have an urge to transfer a giant, delicious piece of pumpkin cheesecake from your mouth to your thighs.  It's also an option if you want to enjoy drinks with friends on the heated patio in the glow of the Vegas-esque fire fountains, potted palms, and giant chandeliers.   CoCo County excess at its finest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=960

The wait is tremendous unless you go at off times. And the bill is staggering.  On the last excursion to this house of excrementation we had a party of six. Once all together and seated, we placed an order for drinks. These were delivered two at a time over a period of half an hour in the midst of which we placed our food orders.  We're a pretty diverse bunch. Mom and Dad split a veggie pasta which would have been good had it been served hot. As it was, it was cool when it reached the table. I had ""Jamaican Shrimp"". While the shrimp were hot, the black beans were cold. I had no idea that they overcook their shrimp to the rubber biscuit stage in Jamaica until I tasted this dish. The rice was lukewarm warm, and the one component that should have been cold, mango salsa, was lukewarm. The Baja Fish Tacos also suffered from cold beans and rice. Cold portions were sent back to the kitchen. The ""Bang-Bang"" chicken and Shrimp was sampled and discovered to be more ""Whimper-Whimper"" than ""Bang-Bang"". The young guy had a gigantic bowl of spaghetti with meat sauce. I would swear that meat sauce was straight out of the can, right off the Sysco truck..  And all the food had enough salt to turn Lake Tahoe into the Salton Sea.  This place is Applebee's on steroids. The food here has no soul, no magic. It is Corporate American Food, Inc. with an eye toward profit margin. Nothing innovative or inventive and no intentions of ever challenging ones palate. It looks like a Casino because this is exactly the kind of food served at lower end Casino food courts.  Look, if you want a great meal, it can be had in Walnut Creek.

I came here for the first time after catching a movie at the Walnut Creek Century Cinema, which is very conveniently located right across the street.  Originally we planned to hit Va-de-vi, but hell, we are lazy Americans therefore the closest joint wins! I was impressed.  I have never actually dined at a Cheesecake Factory before, these folks have got the business model down!  The place was PACKED.... at 4pm on a Saturday. We managed to grab two seats at the bar, although they were like kiddie seats, 2 feet lower than the rest of the folks at the bar.  I truly felt like I was at the kiddie table... wanted to ask for crayons or something! Service was fantastic.  Pretty much the second we sat down, the kind and efficient bartender asked what we'd like to drink.  We asked for drink menus and we were set within seconds.  Their menu is extensive! I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and my friend ordered a Pink Lemonade cocktail...  the cocktail was very tart and delicious and my Chardonnay was crisp and perfect. We also ordered a couple of items off of the ""small plates menu""... .there is NOTHING over $10 on this menu.  We enjoyed a fabulous tuna tartar dish ($6) and crispy fried artichoke hearts ($5).  Nice prices!!  At Va De Vi, either of these dishes would have been at least $10.   It's definitely got that corporate, franchise feel to it...but not too bad.  It's hard to believe that an Andronico's used to be housed here. I will be very interested in coming here in the Spring/Summer to hang out on the fabulous patio with fireplaces and gorgeous foliage.

Arlene F.,"Vallejo, CA",40,44,,4.0,2/17/2010,"You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. I've been there multiple times over the years and to various locations (East Coast, Hawaii, West Coast, etc.) and I'm always pleased.  It's been especially nice to have one nearby finally.  I was just there for Valentine's Day and went with my husband and two boys.  I love that they cater really well to my children and have the food out as soon as possible - just so the little ones don't get antsy. I had their Orange Chicken. And let me tell you, I don't usually order Chinese unless it's in a Chinese Restaurant. But, this was good. I ate it all. And the lunch - size was just right. I also had my favorite Ahi Carpaccio for an appetizer - always a pleaser.  But I can tell you there is a lot on their menu I like and would recommend:  This BBQ Chicken Salad The Meatloaf The Chicken and Biscuits The Shepard's Pie The Tataki Salad The Rotisserie Chicken (not the right name, I know...) The Three Cheese Pizza The Shrimp Pasta with Tomato Basil (not quite the name...) And of course, their cheesecakes...yummy!

Party of 4, first available table, in or out- 20 minute wait.  Nope, outdoor seating, we waited an hour, sat in an area where the heaters were not effective. Asked our waitress if the bar had single malt scotch.  What is single malt scotch? she asks.  Legitimate question and I briefly explain.  She returns with the answer - yes, we do have single malt scotch.  What do you have available?  Let me check - another trip.  Another waiter returns asking what I am asking for - a list of single malt scotches - okay, I'll get that for you.  The waitress returns with the list.  Oban 12 - great!  I'll take it. I ordered White Chicken Chili and a tossed green salad with honey mustard dressing on the side.  The chili was flavorless - really, I wish I could give a better description for you, but it was just flavorless, nothing distinctive, just no flavor.  The salad was delivered with oil and vinegar dressing on the salad.  I mentioned it was ordered with honey mustard on the side - I'll take care of that.  She did - she didn't remove the salad, she simply brought a vessel of the honey mustard dressing.  I guess I was to use it on top of the salad with the oil and vinegar dressing on it.  I didn't even bother to address this issue.  I just ate what she originally brought. Now, I know a restaurant that offers the selections The Cheesecake Factory has cannot be good at any of them.  But, I do expect acceptable food, but this was quite terrible. Too many better restaurants in WC to spend time and money here.  Beautiful and interesting interior architecture and an inviting outdoor patio are the pluses.

Dani M.,"Weymouth, MA",0,36,8,4.0,8/19/2011,"This is a chain, obviously, so you're always going to have good and bad experiences, but overall it is a good place to come. The variety is amazing, you won't find any other restaurant that has as many choices as they do. Their cheesecake is delicious! Also many flavors to choose from there. Portions are big, but honestly this is America since when does anyone honestly care about portion, people keep on eating it and getting bigger . If you don't like it then don't eat it all or ask for smaller size.  Ask for a box right when you order your food stick half in it and then eat the rest and you have two meals for the price of one!  Some favorites- the chicken chili with white rice, vietnamese tacos, tex mex egg rolls, georgia peach drink not so great- cosmos (didnt make it very good when I got it there and that's my favorite drink so big bummer), their brioche egg breakfast sandwich, the buffalo wings with ranch sauce ( i've had much better elsewhere ) oh and the avocado egg rolls (you better LOVE and I mean LOVE avocados, I love them but not as much to enjoy these ) I've had really good service every time i've gone. Just recently had a really nice server named Jessica (i think) I was with a friend for late lunch/early dinner and she mentioned it was my birthday at the beginning when she ordered drinks for us. She let us talk for a long time only coming by when needed (which is always nice ) and when we didn't order dessert she brought by a little sundae for me anyways because it was my birthday. Very unexpected and very kind of her. It's loud if you go during peak hours. The food and dessert are yummy. You won't regret going.

Rolo R.,"San Francisco, CA",32,39,,1.0,4/20/2014,"This review is base on their management. A friend of mine applied for a position for this particular Cheesecake Factory. He went there in the afternoon, and spoke to the manager at the time, after the interview was done he was told that he will get a call back after they do a reference check on him. 2 days later finally they're done with the checking of his references. He was told to come in at a certain time one day the week after. He went in the day he was told to comeback. So when he got there he was told that the manager that told him to comeback that day is off, and no other manager has any notes or some type of recollection of the 2nd interview for that day. So he wasted his time coming there for no reason because since nobody can interview him for the 2nd time that day he was told to comeback again a few days later. This is without an apology from any of the management members and it seems like there's a lot of them there. You would think they are communicating with one another but apparently not. It shocking that this establishment is successful if the management member is not talking to each other. The only excuse given to my friend is that they are on a transition of getting new managers. For me that is not a legitimate excuse, if a company is going through changes it's the companies job to communicate with one another on what's going on with the restaurant. So my friend that was not interviewed the 2nd time was ask to comeback again. So he came back again to meet with another manager that he was told he was suppose to meet with, but guess what? That manager is off for the day already when he was asked to comeback that certain time. This is unbelievable! You can understand the frustration of my unemployed friend who's been told over and over again to comeback so that someone can interview him. He waited about 30 minutes for a new manager there to interview him where she only asked 3 questions. After that 3 questions, the manager that was interviewing him told him that if he doesn't hear from them within 24 hours they moved on to another applicant. Without any type of apologies all he was told was to move on if he doesn't hear from them. My friend is planning on calling the department of labor because he felt like he was discriminated by this company, and he is also going to call Cheesecake and ask for their Regional manager and corporate office because of this whole situation that occurs. He know this review may not matter since this is a huge establishment and it doesn't matter how many bad reviews is written about this place they will still be successful, but he just wants his voice to be heard, and sends out this warning for whoever want to work there. Because of how he felt he was treated he will never be coming back to this place to eat, and his friends and family will sure hear about this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=980

Parking garage is right next door, which is convenient (3 hours free or valet parking for $7.00).  If the lot is full, there are other parking garages all around.   The front is very inviting with what looked like a casual waiting area to the left of the entrance and outdoor dining to the right.  Nice fire/heat features on both sides.  Like all Cheesecake Factories, the decor inside is the same. We went on a Friday afternoon for lunch.  We waited less than two minutes to be seated (not bad for the lunch hour).  Our waitress was extremely friendly and fortunately, we did not have the same experience as some others with the hostess (as far as not being addressed when we walked in). The Miso Salmon lunch plate has always been a favorite and will continue to be so after this visit.  I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta dish (I forget the exact name).  The pasta was hard and it was too oily.  The vegetables were good (sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke, mushrooms). But, I don't recommend this dish.  I normally am not disappointed with what I order here, so this is my first disappointment.  The bread is very good (don't eat too much of it, because the food portions are pretty hearty).

It was a Sunday and we got there around 5:45, the hostess said there would probably about a 20 min wait.. No problem. This wait wasn't too long, the 7 of us ended up getting seating in a 6 person booth. I guess they are okay w/ squeezing people in.  Not only was it squashy it was damn dark. Good thing I pretty much picked out what I wanted before we were seated.  5 out of 7 of us decided to get a crap load of snacks and small plates to share while my brother and Dad got a giant salad and Chicken and Biscuits. We were pretty tough customers b/c my mother is allergic to almost everything. She can't eat any type of dairy or eggs so we had to ask for all sauces and cheese on the side. Yes, I know that request right there is setting ourselves up for a disaster.  The BF ordered a bowl of White Cheddar soup (or at least that's what the waiter said) and out came White Cheddar and Broccoli soup 20 min after we ordered it. Not sure if they were growing the broccoli in the back or what, but I was sure soup in general is made ahead of time.  Maybe the Chef's arm fell off or something. The appetizers also took an eternity to come out.  It took another 15 min after the soup for our first little small plate to come out. To top off the horribly long wait was the last dish, the sweet corn tamale cakes. This came out w/ HUGE dollops of sour cream on the top. He did however bring the green sauce on the side, but I'm not sure if he understood us when we said ""My mother is allergic to ALL DAIRY"" He then asked us if it was okay to scrap off the sour cream.. WTF??? NO.. She can't eat any of it..  We ended up leaving a good 2 hours later.  Never again will I come back here.. Only if I'm forced to..

My food has consistently come out late and either cold or was left under the heat lamps too long. I have frequently seen the staff on the sides talking rather than doing rounds. I understand people come here because they enjoy the chain or love cheesecake factory.  But poor service and unqualified staff leads to a bad experience.  Try yacht club, 1515, or the other amazing restraunts in wc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1040

Don't go here! We waited for almost 30 minutes at our table with no hello, no water, no bread. Nothing!  Everyone around us was being helped. It was bizarre! I asked a bus boy to get our waiter, no one came. I asked a waitress if she could please get our waiter and her response was "" Oh, that's me.""  What!? No I'm sorry or care at all that we had been waiting so long. She was rude and seemed bothered to be helping us. But we ordered and hoped it would get better. Oh were we wrong. After waiting more than 10 minutes after she took our order for drinks I asked for the manager. He was friendly and blamed the wait on himself. And I told him our waitress seemed annoyed with us. He said he would get us a new waitress and apologized. Our waitress then finally came back with the drinks, threw them on the table and walked away. At this point I really just wanted to leave. But we had already ordered and I had placed an order to go for my boyfriend. So we waited.  Our new waitress came and introduced herself, she was friendly. And then our food came. Great! Except we had ordered an appetizer and it never came. So we told them to forget the appetizer we would just eat our salads. No one knew what was going on. When the manager came back to check on us we told him about the appetizer. He offered to give us a free desert so I took a piece of cheesecake for my boyfriend to go. Good thing I did because big surprise, his to go food never came. It wasn't even on our bill.

Immediately she brings it out and says ""this just came up"". After eating our appetizer, another 45 minutes or so passes before I have to ask, yet again another passing waitress (because our waiter still had yet to check on us) where our entrees were. By this time most tables around us had been seated, received their meals and left already. I was getting frustrated.  Finally after 2 hours, our lunches arrive. My Mediterranean Mahi Mahi is in a huge pool of oil, absolutely swimming in it. If i could have sent it back, I would have, except for the fact that our waiter never once came to check on us. With my baby getting more and more fed up by the minute I ate what i could and asked a random person for our check.

I, being Irish, was looking forward to the Shepherds pie- *let me stop you here, if you have the same plan*. I was so disappointed. It tasted like a 1.99 frozen dinner salisbury steak- reconstituted with pasty mashed potatoes. I have had better and wished I had ordered something else. Now, onto desert!

I called my bank and they stated it was most likely a mistake and probably would be corrected by the restaurant the next day. The next day was a Saturday, I checked again on Monday and still had the same 2 charges pending on my acct. I gave it one more day to see if it would clear. Checked again on Tuesday and still both same charges pending on my acct. I called the restaurant and spoke with a Mgr who assured me they only processed 1 charge and tried to explain how it could have happened. Basically, what it boiled down too was employees not following procedures with payment processing. My acct was finally corrected but after tying up my money for both charges for 7days total, 5 working days.

I came here for dinner with a couple of friends from out of town, hoping to enjoy a delightful birthday meal, and we got the exact opposite. After waiting forever for our entrees to arrive, I took bite out of my pasta and nearly had to spit it out because it was so salty! My entire table came to the same conclusion. Our server was nowhere to be found, our glasses were all empty, so we flagged down a different waiter who couldn't find our waitress either. Finally she comes around and I tell her about my food, at which point the manager comes to say that they added salt to the pasta water, so that's probably why. The rest of the table is nearly done eating by this point, so I don't want to order another dish. So we order cheesecake. The waitress tells us this round of dessert will be quick to arrive, apologies for the massive delay before, but again 30 minutes pass before we decide to ask where our dessert is. She checks and it eventually arrives. After we ask for the check, another 20 minutes pass before it arrives. At this point, the restaurant isn't even busy anymore - all the surrounding tables are empty. I just want to pay and leave, but we can't even do that. We can see our waitress standing about 15 feet away, entering tips into the computer and neglecting our empty water glasses and attempts to get her attention to just pay. Finally, she swings around and we are free to go. There was no thank you for coming, or anything mildly polite. I have eaten at other Cheesecake Factory's before and enjoyed my experience.

Their factory Appetizer Favorites is always a good way to go which easily feeds 4 people.. & their desserts are crazy good! There is definitely something for everybody. This new spot in Walnut Creek has a very cool ambiance, great decor.. The nicest looking Cheesecake Factory I've been to & is usually really busy.. Their outside patio & dining is what tends to catch your eye especially driving by at night.. It's a cool place to lounge next to an outside flame with drink in hand..  Their servers are cool.. real attentive & friendly.. They have plenty of free parking right around the corner which also has valet right in front of the back entrance. A couple major downsides with this Corporate chain is that they do NOT take reservations & you can almost always count on long waits (usually more than 45 minutes to an hour & a half) during peak if you are not willing to dine outside (which you are seated immediately once the next table is available) so I recommend to come early or have a seat at the bar..

However today being a pleasant spring-like day, my friend and I thought we would try sitting outside--surely we wouldn't have the same noise problem in the open air. Wrong! The 'background' music being piped to the patio was cranked up to such a high volume that it was quite the challenge to carry on a conversation. I know some people don't mind it, but I've never cared for shouting and straining to hear when I'm trying to have a relaxed visit. In the future, I still wouldn't be adverse to stopping by to take out some of their famous cheesecake, but it's unlikely I will be sitting down for a meal--even outside I now realize. However note that the food was perfectly good, and our server (Nicole) was top-notch. I would give the service alone 5 stars and the food alone at least 4, but the loud music was so aggravating and such a drawback to the experience that I am dropping the rating to 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1100

Ping P.,"Medford, NY",26,372,3,3.0,9/5/2011,"Three Stars - FOR WHAT IT IS... so I am comparing this establishment to other like establishments: Big Box, High Volume, Everyone can find something on the menu they will eat  kinda places.  Due to the proximity of the movie complex - during certain times be prepared for a LONG wait. We got there last night about a quarter of 6 and waited 10 minutes for an outside table. Inside and we could have sat right down. Just 15 minutes after we arrived - line out the door and into the patio. I use this only to illustrate that you must time your visits or prepare for a long wait. Given our experience - I bet the 6 PM folks were planning on a 7:30 or 8 PM show so they arrive at 6:00 - 6:20 - super busy ...but by 7:30 when we were leaving - no one around - could walk right in and sit down. Now wait for it - the movie let's out and I bet there is a mad cheescake rush for apres movie sweets.  so those are the logistics.  When you peruse the menu - it is extensive... almost TOO extensive and creates confusion. I opted for the asian weight managment salad because at 600 calories that was plenty and then some for my dinner intake. My husband had a chicken piccata thingy. Based on the waitperson's recommendations we opted for some small changes to each meal to customize it... NONE of those changes were made in fact we are sure that my husband ended up with another diners meal as his had none of the changes he asked for and a bunch of changes he didn't ask for - so someone grabbed the wrong meal. When we alerted the guy who brought our meals to us (our waitperson was on break) he apologized and said he would immediately bring our corrected meals - that NEVER happened. We finished our meal and we let our waitperson know what happened. It wasn't exactly her fault but at the same time she now knows that her back up can't be trusted and shouldn't be tipped out.  Just a note: our server and all our servers were super friendly and really did try I think.  The cheesecake - wow ... out of a box icky. Way too sweet. Way too fluffy and creamy for a real NYC cheesecake experience. We tried the original and the chocolate rasp. The chocolate rasp has two bites out of it and now sits in our fridge (I am typing this the following morning) in an appropriately shaped little plastic coffin...RIP little cheesecake!  So all in all - great place for large groups that are cool with mediocre to okay food (and lots of it), families: parents will be able to get their buzz on, kids will find all kinds of fried snacks to pimple up on and grandparents who are footing the bill won't feel raped when the tab comes.

I thought we had gone to Vegas for a minute. The old Andronico's grocery, has been transformed into this expansive, glittery, Las Vegas appearing restaurant. I LIKED IT! Not your standard strip mall diner that is so common in the East Bay. This place has some visual POW to it. One thing you will notice immediately is that the entire room booms with noise. Very very noisy. So don't expect a quiet evening here. Kind of a cool bar area with lots of high tables. I suspect that a lot of people hang at the bar and have the 'small plates' for dinner. This was a late Sunday afternoon, and the place was packed. The menu is just as expansive as the dining room, it reads like a book, complete with advertizements inside. Not sure I like that, but hey, if it pays the bills, and helps out the local stores, go for it. Good variety of food choices that I think would fit into just about anyone's desire to eat. And, everything we saw go past us looked pretty good and fresh. Even the 'small plates' looked pretty substantial. Our server was a little on the slow/confused as to where we were in our dining, side. But, she did ok in the end. The servers are all buzzing like they are late for their final exam, so you get the feeling you should be hurrying along with your meal as well.  Our food was fresh and simple, yet good. Not a fine dining experinece, but certainly a good option for those looking to have a decent meal out. This was our first time here, so we will see if the consistency holds up. As always, my abhorrence with how people dress and act when going out, was not a let down.  Aside from the plethora of aweful tacky jeans to the knees, size XXXXXXXL T-shirts (untucked of course), baseball caps and sunglasses being worn, there was a table of 10 people (all about the same age so it wasn't John and Kate plus eight), 6 of whom had that cell phone plastered to their head the entire time they were eating.

Eventually, he gets replaced with an ever slightly more competent waiter who takes our order.  A few minutes later, he comes back and asks us to repeat our order because he can't understand what he wrote.  ""I wrote org chick and I didn't know if that was orange chicken or org chicken.""  Now I'm not sure what Org Chicken is, but I don't want to eat it. We ordered the spinach cheese dip which was served to us as an artichoke.  One of us ordered apple cider and was brought apple juice (not the same).  They brought out our food, and hadn't made one person's entree.  We had two managers apologize and about 20 apologies from our clearly overmatched waiter.  The appetizer and the forgotten entree were comped. The service was pretty horrible.  The food is ok enough I guess and the oppressive decor can't be topped. They do serve way too much food.  Sure, it's my fault for actually eating it, but all the margins are in dessert, and when I was done, I didn't want any.  They could have sold me a slice of delicious cheesecake!

I have been to this location 3 times since it opened. The service has progressively gone down hill on each visit.  During my last visit, we sat on the patio. We may have just as well sat across the street because the service was that disconnected and abysmal. Some background: I had finished a long run about an hour before our visit and hadn't eaten since lunch - this means I was hungry and thirsty upon arrival. We promptly ordered drinks, an appetizer and asked for bread. Two of us got iced teas and two of us got drinks from the bar. The two of us who got drinks also specifically asked for water as well. The two iced teas came quickly. The two drinks took 10 to 15 minutes (which is fine I'm not a lush) but the water and bread didn't come either. The excuses were that the bar was busy and the bread was ""on the way"". When the drinks did arrive, I drank mine pretty quick because I was very thirsty and I still had no water. Bread eventually came as did our entrees. As I was still thirsty, I just decided to go to the bar and get two glasses of water myself. This was nearly 30 minutes after we sat down. I'm not too demanding or jerky but this was ridiculous. The server noticed the purloined glasses and THEN brought two others - waaaay too late. The food was just okay. I couldn't wait to get out of there because I was sick of waiting. Other tables around us were complained about their service as well. The server was pretty much MIA.

Peter J.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",447,230,62,3.0,3/8/2009,"First impression of this place, busy! That's a good thing in my book considering the economy these days sucks but people do have money for good food. Reading through the previous reviews, it seems most had an unpleasant experience, give them a chance. My experience here was good with the food but service was lack luster. they been open for about 3 weeks so I will give them a chance to get on point. Usually it takes about 4 months for a new restaurant to get it just right. I ordered: Hibachi Steak Cooked perfectly *med well* it has grilled onions and mashed red potatoes including some skin and a green colored butter I believe had a hint of basil in it. It was a little too sweet and oily for my taste. Crab Cakes Came out a little too overdone on the outside and the insides were not hot enough. The flavor was there but I would like them hotter. Turn the heat down on the oil about 150 degrees so you can cook them longer and not burn the outsides, it was on the verge of being burnt. Side salad was pretty unattractive and didn't have enough greens, the carrots, beets, and cucumber were all strung out over the lettuce which made for a ugly dish. Corn fritters Cooked perfectly but the corn could have been cooked before mixing it with the corn meal and frying. Calamari Was good but if you go wrong there you must fire the cook. I did enjoy the dipping sauces that came with all the appetizers Fried Zucchini I call these Zucchini fingers, when the dish comes to your table it might remind you of that game jenga, you might be tempted to pick from the bottom. The disappointment! Strawberry Short Cake! Ok when the dish got to me the sponge cake most short cakes come with was a biscuit and even funnier was that it looked like the biscuit the chicken pot pie has in it's gravy. So i took a bite and it was soooooooooo DRY! and was a biscuit. I then asked out waitress to get the kitchen manager for me. I asked if it was the same biscuit the pot pie comes in and he said it was! My GOD! the manager hesitantly offered his apologizes. I told them it can't be called a short cake without short bread. Call it a "" STRAWBERRY BISCUIT CAKE"" but I said I would not order it again if it is made with a biscuit.! all in all I will give them another chance in about 2-3 months, I will order the strawberry short cake again but it better have short cake in it! The whole time I was looking at the Chicken Pot Pie across from me, refraining from taking a bite of their dish, but what do you know! I got to try the biscuit in my strawberry short cake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1080

I ordered: small salad & standard burger.  Could have rolled me out of the restaurant like my name was Violet Beauregarde!  Of course I could have exersized some self control and eaten off of them for 3 days, instead of consuming 3 days worth of food in one sitting....but then it wouldn't be glutony, now would it? The burger was scrumptious!  The meat was perfectly cooked and juicy and full of real beef flavor!  It was topped with a grilled red onion & served with french fries that I gave to my daughter.  The salad was pretty standard, though large, with lots of fresh veggies and really good balsalmic vinegrette.  The service was decent, with some great aspects and some not so great ones.   My dinner partners ordered mud pie (which was actually chocolate cake a-la-mode) and we all had some & left half of it behind.  Could have served 6 people from that one piece of cake! So here are my Cheesecake factory tips: Go for lunch & get the same food for less money Share 1 entree, 1 appetizer & 1 dessert for the whole table.  I don't care if you have 2, 3 or 4 people, don't order more than 1 thing!  You'll regret it later.... unless, of course, you have self control and can eat 1/4 of your meal & get the rest to-go.  Just get the take-out box when your food comes.  Don't even pretend you might eat it all. The interior design is a bit cheesy vegas.

The waitress who helped us out in the patio with our drinks before we went in to our seats was great. Very friendly and prompt. Once seated we had another great waiter who was friendly and did not make us feel rushed to order even though they were swamped with customers.  The bad. For the price that we payed for our meal I was VERY disappointed. We ordered Orange Chicken, Chicken Marsala, and a salmon meal. Both chickens were over cooked and the salmon was VERY fishy (sorry maybe it's just me who doesn't enjoy such a fishy tasting salmon). We walked out of there spending over $130 for 3 meals, 3 drinks and 3 slices of cheesecakes. This was my second time at this location.

Christopher B.,"Clayton, CA",6,78,,3.0,3/6/2010,"Okay, on a normal day this place would receive at lest 4 stars, because the food is just awesome and the portions border line crazy, but yesterday was kind almost a uncomfortable experience here. For some reason our server was just not down with us at all. He was actually kind of rude. He would come by and barely say anything to us, other than the few things he was obligated to say as a server, and when he brought the check he didn't even say anything. Sure, we probably weren't helping by talking shit about him pretty much right in front of him, but he was being a douche before that. In the end he did bring us everything we needed, so we tipped him the appropriate amount. Now the important part; the food. This menu is so huge, it has like 4 different types of cuisine on it, and their ""specialties"" section is pretty much the entire menu, which doesn't really help make choosing any easier. I tend to usually order the pulled pork sandwich, which is a monster of a sandwich that satisfies on so many different levels. Today however, I went with the spicy crispy chicken sandwich. It is a delicious sandwich, with a chicken breast so big that it must have come from a mutated chicken created by mad scientists in a lab. My only problem with this sandwich is there is not quite enough buffalo sauce on it. If I'm ordering some spicy chicken, I want some fucking SPICY chicken. That's why I ordered it. This chicken was completely dry all over, except for tiny pocket of buffalo sauce in the middle. That one bite pocket was pretty damn good though. I don't know who orders the cheesecake here. I'm not ready to eat anything for the rest of the day after I eat here. I've had the cheesecake once though and I understand why they are called the cheesecake factory, although their name should really be ""The Obesity Epidemic Factory"", which I would still go to. Their cheesecake so rich and perfect, there is no nutritional justification for eating it. However, if you ever have the stomach space for it, do it.

Jermaine B.,"American Canyon, CA",8,4,,3.0,10/24/2011,"Yesterday afternoon my wife and I decided to eat somewhere south of Napa for a change and we stumbled upon The Cheesecake Factory. Busy of course, the wait actually was only 5 minutes or so. Upon initial impression, I was not pleased with what appeared like caos and loss of control by the FOH management.  The servers uniforms were distasteful (white shirt, white pants, white apron, and white tennis shoes) The servers seemed out of control and more concerned with the idea of hanging out with each other during the shift then the fact they are on the clock to serve guests. I noticed 1 shift leader, whom looked completely lost and uninterested in being on the floor. We were also led to our table without it being wiped-down and had to stand in the middle of the aisle until two bussers finished a table that seats 4. Really? It should not have taken two bussers to clear and wipe down any table in the restaurant. The highlight of our experience was definately, and surprisingly, the food.  Moderately priced, we ordered the calamari as an appetizer and the children's sliders for our son. Our food was delivered to our table in and around 7 minutes and was fresh, warm and ready for our opinions. The sliders were well portioned for a child, with a light potato bun and seasoned fries. Calamari was really good, lighty-breaded and served with a ketchup/horseradish cockail sauce. My wife ordered the bbq burger entree' meal, which was cooked to a perfect 165 degrees and served with crispy red onion rings and fresh organic lettuce. We passed on dessert, but left very full and pleased with our meal. I give this experience an overall grade of a B minus. Food stellar, but sub-par service and overall poor flow of the restaurant floor. If you can get passed the madness of servers looking like chickens with their heads cut off and servers wearing sunglasses, you will trully enjoy the freshness and great flavors the corporate chefs have put together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1060

After being seated a waitress came with a second waitress and introduced her stating she would not be our waitress but the other one would. Do not know what this is all about.  Also the watching wait staff standing around doing nothing while others run back and forth is unsettling.  Major complaint asked how many carbs in low carb cheese cake.

I wanted to tell him we can order since he already gave us 15 minutes to but he ran away. Right there, I knew this is going to end bad.

Bri B.,"San Diego, CA",1,44,73,1.0,8/9/2012,"I have been there a couple times over the past few months. I feel like the Cheesecake Factory is put on a pedestal, since the environment inside the restaurant seems more upper class, and it is kind of pricier.. Anyway, I got a lemon chicken meal once, although it was huge as hell, it was the kind of chicken with a bone... like a fat ass chicken leg that you would buy from the carnival.. anyway, I don't really expect high class restaurants to use that kind of ugly chicken, i was hoping for a boneless breast or something.. The second time I got Salmon... how could you go wrong with salmon right? anyway they put some weird tasting sauce on it, that I wasn't expecting.. and also the salmon had a nasty texture, it wasn't really soft and also it just tasted gross. I love salmon, so this was definitely a heart break for me... They also don't have rice pilaf, so I just order normal white rice (i'm half filipino so I didn't mind as much..) but their rice... I could have made it better at home.  I tried to order Tiramisu but they were out. The waiter asked me more than 3 times if I was sure I didn't want anything else.. Are you kidding me? I was with a group of 15+ people so there's no need for him to try and suck up my money too, considering I didn't like the food so far and I only wanted Tiramisu! Jeeze I wanted him to stfu.. Today I actually went there at lunch with a friend, the lady asked inside or outside and we said inside.. we had to wait 5 minutes before being seated, although there was no wait!! unless you had a larger group but for only 2 people there shouldn't have been a wait.. also she seated us outside!! it was kind of hot so i just took off my jacket and dealt with it... then some guy approached us 5 mins after sitting down and said a waiter will be with us.. and then the same guy came back another 5 mins later and said he would be the waiter. throughout the meal he did not check up on us much and my water was empty for 3/4 of the lunch. He actually did come up and mention he would get me water, twice before he actually got the water.. I was not happy in the service, since he seemed too busy running around for other tables... and then also the service is bad, none of the people pay attention enough This restaurant doesn't seem to put enough effort towards their food. Once I went to TCF in SF and order a caesar salad but they gave me some weird ass salad with hella nuts in it.. gross.. so then got my caesar, which was also gross.. it's like they don't use traditional food or sauces/cooking methods that one would expect.. ugh.. the ONLY thing bringing me back here is the fried macaroni and cheese but once i find another place for that, I'll be gone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1060

It was the evening before my mother would return to Mexico, so naturally my brothers and I wanted to do something for her so we decided to take her to the cheesecake factory. I figured most of the bad reviews for San Francisco  CF are for the pricing too high and the cramped space, not many about the customer service. So we took her there,they don't take reservations even for big parties so we decided to wing it, now mind you, I was already on edge about my mother leaving so imagine my frustration when they said it'll be an hour wait and 4 of us would be at one table and 4 of us at another but they wouldn't be together!! The host said by the time we got a table large enough for us it would be closing time, it was 8:30!! Still fairly early but anyways thats a whole other review.. So we ended up at the CF in walnut creek (I wad extremely reluctant but again we winged it). I called ahead to see if they had enough room for 8 of us in about 30 minutes ( the drive from sf to wc) she said it would be a wait but yes  we got there and We waited about five minutes and were seated.  The waitress took our drink order but forgot my brothers wine, strike one.  One of the runners then brought out the food and brought out the wrong order again for my brother. He said that wasn't what he wanted so he took it back. Five minutes later, our waitress shows up with the same dish, sets it in front of him and says ""this is what you ordered"" and left.  He got up to get a manager, meanwhile I signaled our waitress over and say okay this isn't the pasta he ordered, the chicken is fine but not the pasta. She says ""okay do you want me to just leave the chicken here?"" WHERE WAS SHE GOING TO PUT IT?? there were no extra plates so I am curious as to what her thoughts where in that moment. I said ""um can you just take the whole thing back and maybe replate the chicken with the right pasta?"" so she took it back, by then the manager was at our table where my husband proceeded to describe what had just happened. My husband mentioned he worked at Ruths Chris for some time and he had never seen customer service like that. Now I've heard the manager is arrogant and will roll her eyes whenever approached by such issues, but she was very apologetic to my brother and my husband. But I didn't really appreciate the fact that after we got done explaining what happened she looks at my husband and says ""you worked at Ruths Chris? Cool, were you there when Vince was there?"" and tried to make conversation. TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL. We called you over to deal with an issue, not to strike up a little chit chat with my husband! Deal with the issue and that's it! We did end up getting another waiter but ny brother decided against any food or dessert for fear of bodily fluids ""accidentally"" ending up in it out of spite.  The next waiter but was okay but was kinda creepy walking up and down the aisle staring at us in case we wanted anything. When we got the check we gave him a pretty large tip considering he only took over our dessert, but this jackass had the shamelessness of COUNTING it right at the table! Who does that?!  We didn't even get any compensation for what the other waitress did. Not even one free slice of pie or a small discount as an apology. You figured we gave them 230 of our dollars they would at least compensate for something!  Needless to say I will never be going back there ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1060

Jeff H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",23,49,38,4.0,12/4/2013,"All Cheesecake Factory Restaurants are good, but this one stands out as a touch better than most. (Might be because I heard the owner lives nearby this one!) It can get busy at dinner hours when weather is nice out. Food is really prepared well. Its a bit loud and busy, but that makes it fun to be in that mix I think. It is not uncommon to hear Happy Birthday sung more than once, as it is a great place to treat someone to that. A bit expensive, but hey, you get that free warm bread brought to the table (ask for the dark bread, its better than the French) If you want to save on the cost, do as me and my wife do, split the Gumbo to two plates. Service is usually good but not perfect. For example last week we were seated after a short 8 minute wait. Place was not terribly busy, yet young lady who sat us down overlooked that the table had no silverware or napkins. Plus it was just wiped clean, yet it was my elbows that saw it was wet, not the hostess. Then the waitress also did not see that we had no silverware, even after food was brought to table, still nothing to eat with. We asked for both silverware and napkins. That might be why I kept a star back from 5! The employees could put that slight extra effort in, to make this place closer to perfect, but some don't. They are quite pleasant though. You can see that some hussle hard, then a couple others have one speed only. I still love this place and always look forward to eating here. Oh, wait, one last thing. The cheese cake is fantastic, but unfortunately it is very expensive! I buy a piece once a year maybe, and then split it to two people usually. Big fresh beautiful pieces of cheese cake, but what, $6.00 or $7.00 a slice? Wow... Great selection too. There is also a secret back left entrance from free garage too. Valet parking too back there.

Instead, I picked up a cake at the to-go counter, which was reason enough to never enter the restaurant again. My wife had already ordered the cake, I was just picking it up.  Although labeled a ""factory"", this outfit seems to have implemented the least efficient process possible for fulfilling to go orders. Despite 5-6 people behind the counter, there was only one lone 20-something both processing orders and packing cakes. Sanitary issues aside, it seems ridiculous that the ""factory"" cannot afford one or two additional minimum wage employees to fetch and pack cakes quickly. Instead, this one poor soul was left to his own devices and as a result did a very poor job of servicing a short, but impatient line.  While waiting in line, I did notice that the factory is selling something called ""weight management"" products.

I kept thinking, I'm sitting in the wine aisle!   What makes a Cheesecake Factory fun is their menu, which reads like a novella, and the discussion of what's good on the menu, what people have tried before, etc.  Oddly, in our party of five, three of us all ordered the same dish, Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (hey, what fun is that ... but we didn't realize until we announced our orders, and didn't want to delay our meal by having to peruse the menu all over again). We started with the Calamari and Sweet Corn Fritter appetizers.  I'm not a calamari eater, but those who were gobbled them up with gusto.  I was pleased with the corn fritters and between those, the fresh bread, and my strawberry lemonade (constantly filled), I almost could have skipped my entree. The pasta itself was pleasingly al dente with olive, eggplant and other summer veggies.  I did get a taste of the Thai Noodle Salad, which had a flavorful peanut sauce.  As usual, no one saved room for cheesecake!    We were early birds for dinner (5:30), so there was only a short wait until our table was set up.  We had a quiet booth in the corner where we could chat comfortably.  The noise level was fairly low, given the size of the restaurant.  All in all, it was a very nice dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1120

The salmon was rated as ""can make better salmon at home myself."" Kids loved the pepperoni pizza and huge grilled cheese sandwich. Cheesecakes were all good but not great-but that's because I prefer a less sweet, denser cheesecake. At least they tasted fresh, looked beautiful, and were crowd pleasers. It would be a 3 star except the service was truly exceptional-even as they had to put up with our 4 noisy, messy child dining companions.

How dysfunctional is that! It was very low class that somebody took our seat, but it was also very bad that the restaurant doesn't even do anything about their seating system.

Scott W.,"Lafayette, CA",8,39,,2.0,6/15/2009,"Just a few quick thoughts because many a yelp-er has written excellent in depth reviews of this place.  The design and decorations are incredible. It looks like no expense was sparred and the space is quite impressive.  The menu is expansive and has a little something for everyone, but they do this at the expense of doing a few things very well. I have never had anything that I hated but nothing that I loved or really even remembered after an hour of eating. The food is mediocre and forgettable.  The service can be hit or miss, getting drinks takes quite a bit of time when you order from a waiter/waitress.  A quick aside from my latest trip here. It was for a birthday celebration and we had around 10 people and the waiter and another waitress had a lengthy discussion about who would get to serve the table because i guess it was made up of tables from both of their sections. They did this right in front of our table and it literally stopped our conversations as we watched to see who would be our server for the night. I had never seen anything like this, it wasn't all that enjoyable.  So yeah, a nice looking place but it has a big name and big wait but not a place i choose to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1120
Steve R.,"Concord, CA",64,66,2,3.0,6/13/2011,"Every single cheesecake I've ever had here has been top notch. My all time favorite is the red velvet cheesecake. Its really filling though, and 1 slice is enough to share with at least 2 people, maybe 3. Also, if you want to save some calories, get rid of 90% of the whip cream they give you! They amount they usually give you is almost half the size of the cheesecake itself!  On to the service..This place is constantly busy and you will most likely be waiting for a table unless you go at an off time.. Not a whole of lot of seating for those who are waiting and the bar area is usually just as crowded. So most times you are stuck to standing around staring at the other people, or if you are given enough time and a pager, you can go out front and sit by the fountain. Once you are seated, the staff is pretty quick to bring bread and take your order. They do a pretty good job of also getting your order out to you and refills on drinks fairly quickly.  I've never really had a bad meal here and there menu is quite extensive. Even though there are a large number of items on the menu, I have always ordered from 1 of 10 things I usually get. I have found that you can never go wrong with the burgers, philly sandwich or the mahi mahi fish dish. This past time I ordered the mahi mahi again and it was excellent. The side dish of mashed potatoes came out luke warm, and was promptly given a brand new side dish with pipping hot potatoes. This is the kind of service that makes me want to come back.  The reason for only 3 stars is that the last few times I have been here the food for my young children came out at the same time as the adults food. Those with kids know that getting the youngsters there food first can sometimes be the difference between having a meltdown or not. The server we had said they would bring out the kids food first, but then the expo brought everything out at once..Like I mentioned earlier, the food came out fairly quickly, but I was more perturbed that the server never came back and said "" let me check on the kids food for you""...

If there's one thing i can't stand it's when someone says the word allergy.. and things like this happen. when the waitress made her way over to check on us, and introduce us to her replacement i explained the situation, she yanked the plate away from me and said oh no your not eating that, hows your tongue?

The service continues to be top notch as well. Yesterday marked my first off experience, and it was only due to the food. Lets talk about service first. We (my mother, wife, and I) were attended to by Cornell. He was everything one expects from a server. Nice, attentive, and a 49ers fan to boot! He did an excellent job and if his manager comes across this review, please provide him with some sort of accolade or commendation! Now for the food. I had the chicken enchiladas. Second time I've had them and they were great! My mom had a shrimp dish and my wife had the grilled Mahi special. My mom's experience was similar to mine. My wife's however, was somewhat mixed. She tells me the Mahi was excellent, but the fries tasted fishy and the broccoli was salty. Seriously? Fishy fries? At The Cheesecake Factory? I tried a few and experienced the fishy flavor as well. How does that happen? I've been to places that specialize in fish and chips and the chips/fries did not taste fishy. How on earth did The Cheesecake Factory pull it off? I know they were just fries on the side. But fires are a basic restaurant staple that should be VERY hard to mess up. Especially at The Cheesecake Factory.  Oh well. In the end, we passed some feedback on to Cornell about the fishy fries and salty broccoli. He apologized, committed to pass it along to the kitchen, and even offered to get a manager (which we declined). He effectively mitigated the situation. I will patronize The Cheesecake Factory again.

The onion rings have a delicious home-made batter with special ranch. Almost all of the seats are booth-style seating. The outside patio looks like a really great place to eat (it's heated by over-head lamps and also has firepits to add an additional flare). There is valet parking for an additional fee, but you should be able to find parking somewhere seeing as how it's downtown Walnut Creek.  The only complaints I really have are that 1.) they didn't have many options for a friend of mine who has a wheat allergy. He ended up having to order steamed broccoli and french fries. 2.) the wait time is ridiculous. We went two weeks after it had opened and still had a 2 hour wait. We went again and had a 45 minute wait. The last time we went we had a 30 minute wait, but we went in the middle of the day on a weekday which was less than ideal. and 3.) the place gets EXTREMELY noisy. Most of the tables are within close proximity of one another and the chatter builds up in there very fast. It's hard to hold a conversation unless you're yelling at the top of your lungs. And since the place is ALWAYS busy, it's hard to get away from this dilemma. All in all though, I'm very glad they opened this place up! It's a new gem to the Walnut Creek area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1140
Neal G.,"Concord, CA",0,17,,4.0,1/27/2012,"It was lunch at 2PM on a Friday, done with work and ready to eat and drink.  This place is an eyefull of ambiance.  Sat at the bar had an asian pear martini, very creamy and fruity, had alot of alcohol but not alcoholic tasting, a five star drink.  Had the fried macaroni and cheese appitizer and what  you would think a fried macaroini and cheese ball would taste like...a heart attack! Not sure why it's not 5 star, just not quite.  The bar guys were friendly and attentive, food was good, try it if you haven't been",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1140
tabisky c.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,334,1,3.0,6/23/2009,"We've been waiting to try this new restaurant in WC; I noticed that most of the earlier reviews criticized the service and that the place needed to work out their service problems. We visited on a weekday after the peak lunch hour (50% full) and was seated immediately.  The waiter (Matt)  appeared right away and asked for our drink orders.  The drinks were served promptly and we were still reading the menu.  The waiter returned and took our order and was pleasant throughout. There was absolutely no problem with the service. The only complaint that I have is the long wait to receive our meals( 1-hr plus). After all we were dining at ""off"" hours and I can fathom  the long wait in the evenings or weekends. Many previous yelpers wrote about the long wait.  It's not the server's problem, but management should look into streamlining the kitchen staff.   All of our meals were great'; the portions were generous and the bread was also good.  I'll probably go back again and hopefully they will get their kitchen problem resolved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1140
colleen f.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,24,1,1.0,8/20/2011,"WAY TOO MUCH NOISE GOING ON!!!! Food is extremely salty, wait people are too spread out, cheescake is not good and way overpriced, and drinks are lousy.  No thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1140
Andrew K.,"Danville, CA",32,57,7,3.0,6/21/2009,Went early and anticipated a 45 min wait which turned out to be 30 min. Seated outdoors as the weather was balmy. Amelia served us and was attentive. Food was good all around and portions were large. This is one of the newest locations and supplants the former Andronicos market. Ate light so we could have cheesecake.  30th Anniversary cheesecake was really good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1140
Joanna S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",13,359,4,3.0,12/15/2010,"Had lunch here last Fri. with a friend at 1:30, which is just after the big lunch surge is over and it is less frenzied. We were seated immediately. While the food was delicious, I fault them for music played way too loud for comfortable conversation. Also, our waitress was hurrying us for some reason, even though the place was not full. I felt I had to defend my plate from being removed before I was finished with my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1140
RICHARD A.,"Pittsburg, CA",4,38,8,5.0,6/19/2009,"My first time eating lunch here was very pleasant. Cheesecake Factory speared no expense at this location. In fact, its the nicest restaurant I've been to. I was greeted, and seated by a very nice server, and was quite interested in getting my order the way I wanted it to be. I got my spaghetti order, and the portion was just right for me to finish without over eating.  But when I ordered their Pina Colada, it was a bit too sweet for me, and barely tasted any alcohol  in it. But overall, I liked the server/ waitress so I gave her a nice tip.  A few weeks later, I was on the free trolley with one of their waitress, and the waitress was bombarded with annoying questions about her job from a passenger. She was as polite as she can be, and tried to answer her questions, and when she had enough, she just left the bus early with a great big smile! WOW what a character, I would have just ignored that person if I were her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1140
Gavel Of Truth X.,"San Francisco, CA",76,88,9,5.0,8/4/2012,"Great place. I think it's awesome. I like this location better than other locations because of its layout and design. The cheesecake is amazing. Love the Key-Lime and Red Velvet and Tiramisu Cheesecake on top of the regular cheesecake. I've been here quite a few times with friends and for birthdays etc... The food is always nice and the service has been good so far! It can take a little longer to wait for a table or food sometimes when they are having a busy night but I don't mind. The parking facility is free right next door so that's a nice little bonus. I think its a little pricier than most places but well worth it since its a place you can take your friends to or use for formal dinner meetings as well which is hard to find nowadays. The ceiling reminds me of Las Vegas Caesar's Palace for those of you who've been there you might share the feeling. Great for groups as well and the wait staff is really patient. It just has that fancy feel to it and its well maintained which is always a plus. The tiki torch outdoor area is super cool in my opinion and creates that fun tropical feel to it which I like. Its also ideally located with a huge Century theater across the street and shopping all around. Great place to check out and great area to be in. Lastly, you can always take things to go such as cheesecake which is always very tempting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-walnut-creek?start=1140
