Kamni G.,"Jacksonville, FL",364,358,160,1.0,12/7/2009,"So I am still a little angry so lets keep this short: 1.Had to wait for a server  2.Corn fritters gooey in the middle, not cooked 3.Manager came when we didnt ask for one and apolgized. Had them remade. 4.Corn fritters came again ,undercooked again manager came and apologized. We didnt we didnt want it and continued to wait for our food. 5. The Navajo says its bread is pan fried but it was way too greasy. The inside was more bland than a salad. The chicken was cooked well but had no salt or anything on it. 6. Crabcake burger ? Decent, best tasting thing all night . 7.Fries too salty. Can see salt on every single one. 8.They gave us free dessert and took fritters off our bill. I still didnt recover from this experience.

Jerry S.,"Brighton, MI",0,22,,2.0,10/23/2015,"I've been to several cheesecake factories across the US and have always had a good meal with very good service.  This location, however, had some service issues.  I waited 15 mins for a waiter to come to my table after I sat but no one approached me.  I went back to the hostess and explained what happened.  She apologized but was not able to come up with a resolution.  One of the other waiters heard me tell my story and said, ""come with me and i'll sit you in my section and i'll be your waiter"".  It was a good save on his part and he treated me very well.  I may give this another try.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2?start=120
Sandy P.,"Milwaukee, WI",60,47,6,3.0,10/21/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those go-to chains that is typically reliable for a decent meal. After my visit last night I am not so sure I will return anytime soon. An old favorite, the Eggplant Sandwich has been watered down by removing the unique Indian Fry Bread and the well grilled veggies. What is left is a boring bun, a flavorless aioli concotion, veggies overcooked to mush and smothered in so much greasy cheese, I literally didnt eat it. My dining partner was happy with her meal.

Lisa B.,"Milwaukee, WI",9,3,,2.0,2/9/2016,"I was very disappointed on my birthday today after eating here.   The music was so loud and they seat you at such tiny tables right in the laps it feels like of those on either side of you.   At the end where they're supposed to give you a free piece of birthday desert, they took my cheesecake that I had ordered to go and put a candle in it for us to share.   I paid $8 for a smaller piece of cheesecake that was supposed to be packed in a box to take with me.   Instead, the container was opened with a burning candle in it and I ended up going home with a half eaten dessert which I paid for.   When I asked for compensation they said that it wasn't how they do things.   Yet the people sitting across from us received their free desert.    It would have been nice to at least be given some kind of free certificate for another piece of cheesecake down the line but I guess my business and my birthday was not very important to them so they won't be getting any of my money in the future.   I will also be spreading the word to friends and family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2?start=120
May B.,"San Jose, CA",107,271,58,4.0,4/6/2010,"I went there last night with a medium-large group, did not have to wait to get seated, our server was pretty good (minus the part where she couldn't open a wine bottle and had another server do it) - she came back many times to check up on us and made sure our drinks were refilled.  All of our food came out really quick and everyone at our table enjoyed their food - I tried more than just my own and I liked it all. I usually am too full to order cheesecake - but I have had it before - a slice is usually enough for at least 2 people. I usually order the plainer types of cheesecake - mainly because I like the simple taste of cheesecake and don't like it drowned out in chocolate and extra ingredients - and they make their cheesecake pretty well. I've been to this location a couple times now, never had a problem. Yes they have a very large menu, but it's also a chain that has to cater to a large crowd. Get over it people. And why would you go to a place like this to order a burger and fries or a sandwich? Silly if you ask me. And portion size - yea they are large, but hardly any larger than most restaurant chains. And honestly people, lets not exaggerate, it's not so large that you have enough for ""the next three days"" or enough to ""feed a family of four""...well unless no one in your family ever eats.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2?start=120

We had a short wait, but it was normal considering it's a popular place on Saturdays. I would recommend to the staff to clean their sticky tables. Ours was sticky, and the staff did not clean the other tables in between customers. I would not recommend the Cheesecake Factory if you want to talk with your dining companion. We were placed on the tables with chairs on one side and the bench on the other. The young boy on one side of us kept kicking the benches, crawling around, and actually kicked my companion before they finally left.

I think they have the best cheesecake I have ever had.  I also enjoyed the appetizers/starters.  The first time I went, for my main course I got a caesar salad without the chicken. The portion size was huge! I only finished 1/4 of it, and I wasn't so happy with it.  The second time, for my main course I got a grilled cheese with cheddar cheese. I didn't like it very much. I don't recommend getting a grilled cheese with cheddar. A different cheese most likely would have been good. It was also a very large sandwich.  I think this place is very good.

The table had a sticky residue on it. FYI...Customers don't mind having to wait for a clean table. Our waitress was great and not overbearing. Hubby and I had the Chicken & Biscuits...DISGUSTING...it was basically an overpriced plate of Chicken Pot pie. It consisted of mashed potatoes on top of that pieces of bland chicken breasts, then on top of that a flat layer of biscuit. This was surrounded by burned and bland vegetables. It was also lukewarm! My mom did enjoy her Crab Bites appetizer & Orange Chicken( a plate clearly for two)which I was glad of. Next on the list the uncomfortable feeling and looks everyone has when sitting extremely close to strangers. The atmosphere was good along with the decorum.

I actually thought I wouldn't like the place because it is your typical huge chain I usually avoid, but I actually had a pretty good experience here. I stopped in for lunch and decided to try a couple of their small plate items. I had the Asparagus Salad and the Wild Mushroom Flatbread Pizza.  Both dishes were better than I expected. The salad was fresh and bright with a nice lemon vinaigrette and lots of shaved Parmesan. The Pizza had a nice crisp crust, lots of earthy mushrooms and just a touch of garlic. The best bite of the day was when I put some of the salad on the pizza itself. The lemon from the dressing really brought out the flavor of the mushrooms. Along with the food I had a surprisingly well made Pineapple Mojito. My server was polite and friendly and the restaurant is very Wheelchair Accessible. As I was leaving, I realized that I had actually gone to the Cheesecake Factory and not ordered Cheesecake! So I guess there has to be a next time.

Tonya C.,"Vienna, VA",27,181,27,5.0,7/19/2006,"For a nationwide chain, I have to say I am impressed with the quality of the food and the ambiance of this outlet in particular. It's a little more up-scale/pricey than what you'd think for a chain as well. In fact, for my birthday recently, my husband and I decided on a return visit for a late-night tapas and dessert style celebration, since the ambiance allows for romantic conversations in secluded booths--with or without liquor being served. The main impetus for our return: Their fantastic hot spinach and cheese dip. The chips seem to be freshly made and somehow not greasy at all. Since we were focused on appetizers, we also got the Thai lettuce wraps, the firecracker salmon rolls, and the fire-roasted fresh artichokes. I'm a *huge* artichoke fan, and I'd never had them done quite like this, with both a balsamic dressing brushed on and a creamy garlic-butter dip to dip the leaves into. I ate myself silly on these. In fact, you might think that four orders of appetizers would be just about right for two people. In the case of this restaurant, you'd be wrong. We took home left-overs of three of those orders... and I digested those artichokes for a whole day before I felt hungry again! Of course, the meaning behind the name can't be ignored either. The desserts available represent a huge variety of cheesecakes and other confections. I'm not big on cheesecakes myself, but their chocolate mousse cheesecake is not to be taken lightly--and I enjoyed the 2nd half of that serving a few days later too. Complimenting the great food are great drinks. If you want something amazingly light and refreshing, try the frozen iced raspberry or the peach smoothie. The wait staff are also a cut above. Courteous and solicitous without being invasive or overbearing, the two waiters we've had on our two visits were cut from the same mold and delivered our food and drinks efficiently but without rushing or crowding us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2?start=140

High ceilings, nice lighting, friendly service (even though they ran out of mojitos at 9 pm) helped make it a pleasant dinner experience. The vegetarian version of the Navajo fry bread sandwich was rather nice and they have what must be the largest portion of Caesar salad I've seen - the leaves, croutons and cheese come piled rather high on a gigantic plate!

While the cheesecake pieces are gigantic, just like everything else on their menu, it never struck me as good creamy cheesecake, the reason, this cheesecake is way sweeter than traditional cheesecake. It tastes like they poured a ton of sugar into their recipes. Again much like the huge portions they seem to think the sweeter the better but that is not the case.

Bf's potatoes were nasty and hard, see the fork marks?  3 shrimp for his scampi and those stupid steak medallions! Med rare my a$$, let's give them 4 small pieces of steak and still screw it up. My Salmon was boring, steak was over done and 3 asparagus spears. Really?.. and don't be so cheap on the butter... I had to ask 3 times and each time they give us 2 little packs, for 5 slices of bread. I like butter on those crappy ass potatoes too. Bf waited for a drink over 10mins-acually it was more like 17mins, before she noticed after running by  3 times, then quite a few more mins to get the drink. Then she takes my bread plate with my knive and fork on it; wait I need those! I grab my utensils and now have no where to put them. Great ! 2 forks are on the table, I assume one for the app and meal and the other for dessert. God knows one isn't for a salad.  What's with no soup or salad for dinner? We spend $22.00 per plate and get this bread, that's all crust.  Then I had to ask if I get vegetables with my meal, most don't get veggies with the meal.    So I get it, they want you to order an appetizer...we order crab cakes, menu says ""plenty to share"" cough cough** bullshit!  3 crab cakes the size of maybe an inch & half.    After the appetizer we wait and wait and wait. We look at each other and we're like: shouldn't we be eatting something? Umm yeah,soup or salad would be nice. We went home hungry.  And what's with the  tacky Waitress  wearing white button down top with fluorescent pink bra showing through. Management should have sent her home to change.

Brian M.,"West Bend, WI",23,137,212,3.0,12/7/2016,"I have been here many times and find as far as the entrees go the Cheesecake Factory is beginning to lose some of its luster.  For those familiar, this location is basically part of the Mayfair mall experience.   As such, one should expect quite a crowd which is generally pushed closely together to squeeze in as many as possible.  Thus it's rather noisy and not a destination for a quiet date or intimate dinner.  My recent Monday lunch (1ish) visit found my group of 4 having to wait 10 minutes for an open table.  We of course were seated in the bank of tables where others are within 18"" on both sides. Cheesecake Factory would be so much better served rearranging the seating format to really focus on the experience of the visit.  It really is an interesting theme and looking around at the interior architecture is part of the experience.  I have always been a fan of the classic burger and never been dissapointed until this visit. I ordered my meal medium & I'm fairly certain the meat was still mooing.  That's on me for not complaining but I hate doing so because there's always that fear of what's happening to the food when sent back. Two of our group received their meals a full five minutes before the other two.  The waitress even came to ask how we were enjoying the first few bites to correcting her question to how half of our group was enjoying their first bites.  We were not offered drink refills at any point during our meal The cheesecake as always was excellent.  Seems Cheesecake Factory is getting a little complacent in preparation & service.  We will return because the Mall is right there & the cheesecake remains awesome but it's time to reboot their game a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wauwatosa-2

Don't come here on a diet unless you have unwavering willpower because that display of heavenly desserts is almost impossible to pass up. Though they do have many salad options and a ""skinny"" menu. They start off with warm bread..so hard not to fill up on the chocolate wheat bread. My favorites include: - Spicy chicken chipotle pasta -Jambalaya pasta  -Chinese chicken salad -Santa Fe salad (that peanut cilantro vinaigrette though...nothing like it) -White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake (my go-to order) -Dulce de leche cheesecake (a light, almost refreshing option) -Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake (brownie bottom, not too rich though) It can get pretty pricey, but you're technically paying for 3 meals.

Jennifer G.,"Sherman, TX",0,4,,4.0,5/7/2016,"We aren't huge fans of chain restaurants, but when we want dessert with our meal, and we both want different types of food, this is the place we go for - it's tried and true, and we have never had a bad experience.  Their menu is huge; it's a bit overwhelming, but it does offer something for everybody. We've been going to Cheesecake for years, and I've sampled something from every part of that menu. Their skinny menu is delicious, salads and sandwiches are always good, their (limited) mexican-ish options are tasty (I love the chicken tacos), and their pasta is always tasty. My boyfriend has tried just about every meat option, and his only complaint was with the filet mignon (it was fatty), and I told him to only order that cut of meat at an actual steak place (he didn't listen). My only complaint is their burgers - they aren't necessarily bad, I know a lot of people enjoy them, but I do not care for them at all. The cheesecakes are always delicious - my favorite is the apple strudel cheesecake! The s'mores cheesecake is also so so tasty. Seriously - even if you're stuffed, which you probably will be because their portions are huge - either get some cheesecake to go, or split a piece with your table. Just don't go to Cheesecake Factory without getting cheesecake!  We've never had bad service here. Sometimes service may be slow, but that has never bothered us. As long as our food gets to us fresh and hot, we are happy. I highly recommend going either before the dinner rush (like 3-4 pm), or after dinner (like 9 pm). If you go during a meal time on the weekend, there's a good chance you'll do some waiting. If you go anytime during a holiday (think Mother's or Father's day), you're going to do some serious waiting. Anyway, I recommend this place.

Jessie H.,"Menomonee Falls, WI",59,1,,1.0,10/28/2016,"Worst experience at this restaurant I have ever had. I will never go back. My boyfriend took me here for dinner. I've been to plenty of different locations and always had a nice time and good food but this was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurants. First they sat us at a back 2 person table that I couldn't even get into without bumping other people. The waitress couldn't even hand us our bread because there was no room. We finally order and I get the shrimp and tomato pasta with basil etc. There was only a half serving of pasta, peas in my meal, and the shrimp was so over cooked I couldn't even bite it- the tails were black. And for 23.00 I got a lousy 5 shrimp. By the time the waitress returned my boyfriend had finished his meal and I had picked at mine enough to wear I just wanted to leave. I explained my displeasure and the waitress said she would get the manager. 15 minutes later the manager appears asking me if I wanted new shrimp and when I said no she just walked away. Meanwhile all this was going on the double date of two middle aged couples in the booth behind us had their phone lights on looking at their menus flashing in the eyes every few seconds enough for me and my boyfriend to say something to them twice and the waitress.  The waitress felt bad and gave us our cheesecake for free regardless of what her manager said and our meal will still 65.00.  The little things like our waitress never filling our water glass, or asking for a refill of drinks. Or not once checking on us till our dinner was over did not even compare to the other issues.  If you want a nice dinner. I beg you, don't go here. Spend your money someplace where it will matter and the staff cares.

If you get sore going through the enormous menu, just go with the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. It seems to be a consensus favorite.  The portions are extremely large, so if you can go for lunch, get the lunch sized portion. Otherwise, you may have some food to take home. Also, these large portions come with a comparable price tag...but the food is really good, especially for a chain.

Jill O.,"Lansing, IL",69,375,949,4.0,7/8/2015,"This is one of the better Cheesecake Factory locations that I have been too. Cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts, so it comes as no surprise that this chain is one of my favorites. I really like the design of this one. It has high ceilings and a welcoming decor. The staff was really nice. Our waiter was really friendly and made great small talk- he noticed my girlfriend's Batman shirt and they excitedly talked about upcoming movies and TV shows. It's a little pricey, but the portions are massive. If you eat like I do, you pretty much get two meals- one portion that you finish at the restaurant and another that you get to enjoy later at home. The menu is so long, but it offers something for everyone. From Chinese food to burgers, to pasta, and everything in between. They also have the best free bread at the start of the meal- seriously, the honey wheat brown bread is one of the reasons to go.  I went with my girlfriend and her mother. My girlfriend ordered the Factory combination, with Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes. She was really happy with everything on her plate. Her mother and I both had Chicken Madeira, and it was amazing. The sauce is the perfect amount of sweetness, and the portion is massive. Her mom loved it too, it was her first time having it and she was really pleased. Naturally, we had to get dessert. Mother got the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. It's layers of cheesecake, fudge cake, and truffle cream. It looked outrageously decadent, and she said it was a good life choice. The girlfriend ordered the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake, and loved it enough that she only ate half so she could enjoy the rest later.

The appetizer came without the soy sauce and our drinks came 15 minutes later (also, I asked for no straws and it came with it anyway). *sigh* The food though was good (the veggie burger and salad were actually much better than expected and had great flavor, even though it was a little small).

Finally, we are seated and given warm bread and butter. Menu is gigantic. Almost overwhelming. You don't know where to start and where to end. The nice thing is there is much variety meaning you will find something that interest you. It's impossible not too.

If you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory, it is worth the drive, wait and price which isn't very bad. I would place them better than ""A-OK"" but the lack of seating is problematic.

Came with lots of mash potatoes to make you full and to make the plate look loaded.  Luau Salad was too sweet for my tastes, but presented well.  Baja Chicken Tacos could have used more flavor, but the tortillas were nice and soft. Not like the typical corn tortillas from the grocery store.

I was told that there were 2 people in the bakery and that the person who answered the phone would go let the 2 people in the bakery know that my phone call would be transferred.

Tonight for example we arrived at 8:30PM to a restaurant that was about half full. The hostess could have gave us any of the half open table and booths. In my experience most people would prefer to sit by a window in a booth, she choose to seat us and one of there small tables in the far back as close as you can get to the kitchen.  In most places this would have not been an issue but CF is already one of the loudest restaurants too begin with, with its high vaulted ceilings the noises just travel. In this case I could barely talk to my wife over the noise of the kitchen staff putting away containers of silverware for the night. When our server was telling us the specials I had to ask him to repeat part of them twice because I could not hear him.

No reservation was accepted, but a not too bad 15 min. wait for table dispite the fact it was busy. Unfortunatly the service was S L O W. It took a very long time to recieve our drinks (server told us a couple bartenders had called in sick or something) Cosmo was very sour. Appitizers were good...crab artichoke dip and a mexican egg roll dish. My food order was totally mixed up however. I ordered the combo dinner, steak diane and herb crusted salmon which comes served with mashed potatoes. I asked if a vegetable was included and the server said he was pretty sure broccoli came with it. Cool. After a bit he returned to say he was told by the kitchen that ""no, veggies are not included.""  I said ok then i would like the side of glazed carrots with it..which on the menu description said glazed carrots with pecans. When food came, my dish had no potatoes, carrots in a brown sugar butter sauce (no pecans) and no herb crusted salmon, just plain salmon with ALOT of lemon on it. Unfortunately I am one of those who do not care for lemon on any fish. Later...much later when we finally saw our server again, he said he 'subbed' carrots for potatoes and he would go ahead and order a side of carrots again, this time with the pecans on it ( like the menu says) but he would have to charge extra for the side of carrots. Well I expected to be charged for the side from the beginning! I never said I didnt want my potatoes or the word 'sub' anything! And, i didn't even bring up the uncrusted, lemony salmon. Just an overall disappointment on my dish. Others seemed to enjoy the pasta dishes they ordered, however, after ordering another round of drinks, it took a half hour to get those (yes we had finished eating for the most part by the time they arrived), it ruined the experience. 3 cheesecake slices between the 5 of us and $235 bill plus (not well deserved) tip. :( ouch. I know our server was probebly busy, i've been there, but a smile and even a brief bit of intrest would have been welcomed.

It's something like 50 pages of junk I don't want to eat. From what I can tell they take a normal dish, add some sort of fusion-y spin to it and therefore make it completely gross.  We don't go here often because the food is both expensive and not good, but when we do venture in we are forced to wait. And wait. And wait. Maybe on principle, because there are always open tables.

It's mostly all about fluff, the food is mediocre.  They pack the people in here & they must serve thousands every day.   The service was great after they took us to the wrong table in the beginning.  Also, the woman patron next to us was complaining about not getting her artichoke, that was a bit annoying but understandable.   Me and my daughter both got burgers & a side of green beans.  The burgers were good & quite big but a bit overpriced. Fries were blah, not even as good as Ore-Ida. Also the green beans were nearly $5 for a tiny portion.  Some of the seating here is quite odd, they put you right next to other parties at some of the tables, that's a tad annoying.   Menu is very massive, everybody should be able to find something if you can read in dim lighting.

The menu is massive and cluttered with ads, it's pretty inside, they have a lot of cheesecake...blah blah blah. You all know this. I'm writing this, though, because I've been to this location twice in the past week while visiting family ...and let's be honest, there are not too many places to have a nice dinner around these parts. So I figure...why not? Our first experience: It was Sunday night and the restaurant was dead....as dead as anything that has ever died. We were sat in a little corner and a few times I felt like we were forgotten about.  We ordered the Boston House Salad and the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. We decided we'd just share both items...and thank goodness we did...HUGE portions. The salad was very good and the sandwich was awesome. Only thing I didn't like was the roasted peppers...they kind of over powered the entire thing.  The bread was pretty cold and hard too :/ Second visit: We came with another couple and it was a little bit busier this time. We were still seated right away and our waitress was very sweet...although very spacey. She took a long time to bring anything at all. We had to ask for the bread and for refills multiple times.  My boyfriend and I ordered the same combo...and it was MUCH better this time. We also ordered the sandwich without the peppers so that was a huge plus. The cheese on the sandwich was more melty and delicious and overall...just a better meal.  The other couple ordered the Salisbury Steak (yeah, I dunno why that was ordered either...huge joke of the night haha) and the Shrimp Pasta. Both of them were very happy with their choices.  The bread was also much better this time around. I'll assume this is because it was busier...but still...make the effort to serve fresh food to all of the guests. My big complaint from this night was the fact that our waitress took so long to come pick up my credit card, we had to flag down another employee to take care of it. It was seriously about 15 minutes!!  So...all things considered...3 stars. I do like the fact that even though this location is at a mall...it's detached from the mall.

More recent experience - still long wait time and the hostess really doesn't know the meaning of 25 minutes when it is more like an hour that you wait.  The menu is huge, just absolutely huge.  It's like reading a book.  Many selections.  The prices are still ridiculous but I have to say that I loved what I had this time and thought it was a really good value for the money.  Chicken Di Pana is very good.  I was surprised when they brought my plate out and it looked like it was a dinner for two. Our waitress was super friendly and the service was great, couldn't ask for better. My friend treated me and my son because she had some gift cards and even with $50 worth, I paid another $25 toward the bill - this was for Lunch!  So yes, the prices are on the high end.
