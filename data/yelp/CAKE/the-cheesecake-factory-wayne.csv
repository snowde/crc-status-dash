That honey wheat bread, I just want a load to go please. So great.  My go to is their salads. The Santa Fe is ridiculously good if you like peanut dressing.  The staff is always polite, they're not rushing you but I always feel like eating and jetting because there's always such a long wait, I tend to feel bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne
Rich R.,"Roxbury Township, NJ",316,333,584,3.0,1/7/2018,"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan.   Whether its Happy Hour, lunch or dinner I haven't been disappointed.    Like any other Cheesecake Factory there will be a wait if it is during peak hours.    After being seated bread is given along with your drink order.  The whole grain bread is. My favorite of the two they give you.   Some other reviewers have had issues with servers.  I never had an issue.  They have always been friendly, attentive and helpful.   I tried quite a few items on the menu and have not been disappointed.   I love all the cheesecakes here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne
Linda S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,,2.0,12/25/2017,We were a party of seven. Some came from experiencing the Hackensack Cheesecake Factory and the Hackensack franchise was much better. Food came undercooked and cold in the middle. Grilled cheese was stale.  My salad came with no dressing. There was gum on the seat. Appetizers took more than 20 minutes to arrive. Incredibly slow.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne
Fallon G.,"Wayne, NJ",336,177,298,4.0,11/25/2017,"I really love the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake!!! If you have room at the end of the meal, it's the perfect dessert! I also really enjoy the salmon. It's not amazing, but it's a satisfying dinner option.  My only complaint is that it's so dark inside and kind of hard to see the menu.

Warren B.,"Morristown, NJ",1086,153,88,1.0,1/8/2018,"Fast casual spelled Performance Food Group. (Not a heavy hitter in quality food)  Certainly not a place I would venture inside. If the corral of baby carriages doesn't send you running for the door the sound of shrieking babies will.  There is nothing on the vapid menu that is made from scratch, but this won't matter to you because the Cheesecake Factory is just that.  Freezer to plate cooking.  If you care about the quality of your food, you'll pass.  If you don't care, this is your kind of place.  Feeding over dining.  Fail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne
Jameslee B.,"West Orange, NJ",0,5,4,4.0,12/29/2017,"I basically eat here with family and friends all the time and I never have a bad experience with the food or service. Majority of the time there is a 20-45minute wait which gives me an excuse to go browse in the mall. They give you a buzzer just in case you don't hear them call your party. When you're seated, the host/ hostess let's you get settled and your waiter/waitress comes to take your order.  I always ask for unlimited whole grain bread. That's my favorite. In addition to the bread I always order the egg roll sampler without the Tex Mex and Crispy Cuban and they always get the order right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne

Derek Y.,"New York, NY",90,212,481,4.0,8/5/2017,"I guess service can really make it or break it for chain restaurants like The Cheesecake Factory, but I would still give four stars to this location simply because the good outweighed the bad by far. Yeah, our waitress wasn't stellar, but she wasn't absolutely horrible; she didn't come around more than twice and didn't check in during the meal except at the end. Still, the quality and portions were consistent (i.e., portions were huge)! The four of us ordered spaghetti and meatballs ($16.95), a caesar salad ($13.95), a grilled fresh salmon ($19.95), and an eggplant parm ($14.95). I can only speak to the taste of the spaghetti and meatballs since it's what I ordered, but the others seemed to enjoy their dishes. The dish was large, of course, so I'm happy. Additionally, the noodles were cooked al dente and were covered in a very aromatic sauce. The meatballs were definitely homemade and were a bit on the dryer/tougher side. Still, a nice dish at a reasonable price. Again, everything was very big. The salad may have been the largest salad I've ever seen.

Nicole B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",57,71,29,3.0,12/23/2017,"Seating was available almost immediately. Our server was okay. He tried to joke a little at the end but was not very attentive at the beginning and during the meal. I aske for water with no lemon and he brought it back with lemon. The water tasted a little funny to me so I got a strawberry lemonade with lite ice. When that came back it was a ton of ice. We asked for brown bread but he said there wasn't any at the time but he would bring it when it was ready. He winded up walking past out table to the one right next to us with the bread and I had to ask again. Finally, we got the bread and it was of course cold! Our appetizer and food came out and everything was fine. So the food was not the issue, it was more of the server.

Sara C.,"Wayne, NJ",166,214,95,4.0,1/22/2017,"I love the cheesecake factory!! I've been going to this location since I was I high school and have never had a meal I didn't like. The portions are insane, so come hungry. I always walk in with the intention of getting cheesecake for dessert but never make it between the delicious pumpernickel bread they serve and half of my entree. I always end up taking at least half of my plate home no matter if it's lunch or dinner. Drinks are also great, but a little on the pricier side (prices for drinks are not listed on the menu) and I've also had some pretty great appetizers there as well. The only downside is that they don't take reservations so I've had to wait 1.5-2 hours for a table (party of 2) for dinner. Lunch doesn't really seem to be a problem with wait times- usually sit down right away or wait a max of ten minutes. Great option if you're in the mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne
Ali W.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",1742,102,440,3.0,3/16/2017,"I've been here on numerous occasions and my last visit was somewhat interesting. First off, I came here with my brother and a cousin of mine on a Wednesday for a quick lunch. We shared a fried mac & cheese, plus a basil tomato flatbread for an app, and both were delicious. Food came out fairly  quick, which is always a plus. Second course: I got the veggie burger with sweet potato fries, my brother got the veggie burger on the ""skinnylicious"" menu, which is just a smaller portion and comes with a side salad, and my cousin got chipotle pasta with shrimp. Food was good per usual. When I had my first bite of my veggie burger, I almost thought I was eating meat. They do a pretty good job with this dish I think. I had a bite of my cousin's food and I don't think CCF is a top option for a pasta dish but it wasn't bad. Overall, food was good.  Negatives: No names will be mentioned but the server I had seemed very unmotivated and careless. I guess because a few workers there know I used to work in a restaurant, they don't seem motivated to work for their tip because they know I will leave 20% or more every time. He/she had one or two other tables and spent a decent amount of time by the host stand conversing with co-workers. The table right next to us sat before us and left before us as well. Service was just really slow. My card was on the table for a good 10 minutes before the server noticed. Maybe it was just an off day so it really wasn't a big deal, but I can't ever stress enough how much service makes or breaks an experience at a restaurant.  One other thing I don't like about Cheesecake Factory in general is their huge menu. It can be a bit overwhelming for a person like me who's somewhat indecisive.  I will be back, but not anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne
Nicole M.,"Hoboken, NJ",10,103,3,1.0,10/8/2017,"Okay for dinner / lunch, but will NEVER be back for brunch. Was there today around noon for brunch. The waitress and manager were dealing with an upset table if 8 next to us so it took us 15 minutes for anyone to even come take our order. Once our order was taken (an omelette and pancakes), it took an HOUR for the omelette to come out. They made some excuse about burning the pancakes and said they were making new ones. 20 minutes later, we told them to forget it and asked for the check. At this point, the manager came over and apologized and said he would remove the pancakes from the check. I told him ""considering we didn't get the pancakes, why WOULD they be on the check?"" After prompting him to do more by telling him removing something from the check that we didn't get anyway was not fixing the issue, he said he would take the omelette off as well. Oh wow, thank you so much kind sir  - I'm glad I came up with that brilliant idea. Also, our omelette was gross and clearly made with powdered eggs. The omelette came out as just that - on omelette. No breakfast potatoes, no toast.  I'll never again return here for breakfast / brunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne

Lynn O.,"Longboat Key, FL",1,27,7,4.0,8/13/2017,First time to Cheesecake Factory for brunch..

Cheesecake Factory only offers brunch on Sunday..  I'm not a fan of lemon anything.. but I did decide to try lemon ricotta pancakes topped with fresh strawberries. They were so delicious!  I would get them again in a heartbeat! My husband had create your own omelette. (you can put up to four ingredients in your create your own omelette).  The omelette comes with either tomato salad or breakfast potatoes..  He had goat cheese & avocado omelette & with breakfast potatoes and bread.. The omelette had a wonderful taste as well!

Jason K.,"Vancouver, WA",0,8,,5.0,9/22/2017,Update- excellent response from management of this store was fast and very much appreciated! Thank you for caring enough to make it right for me - this issue below was resolved to my complete satisfaction. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Very poor service! Left in a back corner of restaurant and forgotten about by our server- Super slow to take order- Food finally arrived- but was missing some components that we requested- but how would she know since she didn't come back after the meal was delivered by someone else- She finally checked on how our meal was after we were basically finished-  We told her about the missing items- and that's when service got even slower- Finally got check after an extended wait- We asked at front desk for a comment card.  Hostess was dumbfounded as to what we were asking about-we explained it was a little thing many restaurants have to get feedback about our experience- of course they didn't ask if we had had a problem-she ended up giving us a business card. By far the WORST EXPERIENCE we've ever had at Cheesecake Factory- Definitely wouldn't recommend this location,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=20

The last time I went, I got the superfood kale salad and it was so dry and bland. But the main reason why I'm giving it 1 star is because of the horrendous service here. It took 30 minutes for our waitress to come over to us and even let us order our drinks. Multiple waiters/waitresses walked past us and didn't once ask us if we were being helped. And then when our waitress did come, she was extremely rude.

Nisha A.,"Paramus, NJ",0,2,,2.0,1/1/2018,My husband and I decided to go to cheesecake factory for brunch on Sunday. We have enjoyed the brunch at the Hackensack location many times and assumed we would have a similar experince at willowbrook. My husband ordered a burrito and I ordered a meatloaf. We also order a breakfast sandwich to share later. When our food arrived I noticed there was hair in the corn. The food was promptly returned to the kitchen. The manager stopped by to let us know that they take all sorts of measures to ensure this doesn't happen but sometimes this will still occur. She offered to recook the dish which we agreed to do. As we were waitng another server came by with a second breakfast sandwich which we told her was not ours. Once I received our meatloaf which took much longer than expected. Our waiter came by again to apologize. I had a few bites and decide it was time to go. Upon inspection of our bill we saw that the meatloaf was comped but a second sandwich had been charged. When we asked our server he said this was done to lower the bill. Apparently our discomfort was worth only 2 dollars. I say be warned as for us we will never ever go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=20
Scott V.,"Pequannock Township, NJ",441,262,582,3.0,1/18/2017,"Very VERY VERY busy Cheesecake factory.  My wife and I took in lunch here on MLK day and when we were leaving, the wait for 25+ deep for a table.  Wow...  Thank God we arrived prior to the rush which was about 11:15ish....  Popular restaurant I guess!! So, like I stated, we got there before the rush and were sat promptly and our server was soon at our table.  We ordered an app, stuffed mushrooms.  They were ""Ok"" and came with a serving of 6.  Very small and for 7 bucks, no bang for your buck with these.  We'll pass next time. The sauce the mushrooms were served in was really good tho, and good for bread dippin'.  For our meals, we ordered salads.  Mine was the Chinese Chicken Salad Dinner portion - Chicken Breast, Rice Noodles, Lettuce, Green Onions, Almonds, Crisp Wontons, Bean Sprouts, Orange and Sesame Seeds. Tossed in Our Special Chinese Plum Dressing.  Very big salad!!!!!  I couldn't even finish it and it was pretty good and flavorful.  My wife ordered the Sheila's Chicken and Avocado Salad Lunch portion - Grilled Chicken, Fresh Avocado, Mixed Greens, Crisp Tortilla Strips, Carrots, Cilantro and Cashews Tossed in a Citrus-Honey-Peanut Vinaigrette.  This was pretty damn big as well for the lunch portion!  My wife and I both thought the salads almost tasted the same and hers didn't come with that many Avocado's, and being that was in the title, you'd expect a few more.  So, why 3 stars?  Well, it took forever to get our appetizer - then our meals.  I think the server forgot to put in our order after taking it because it took almost 20 minutes to get our mushrooms... then another 20-25 mins for our Salads.  We then saw other tables get their food before us, and those tables were sat well after we arrived - and we ordered Salads.. how long does it take to make two salads?  It wasn't that busy when we arrived, so that's why I am pretty sure our order was forgotten about.  On an good note, our server was very polite and attentive.  I can't give 4 stars for the experience, but I'll chalk this up as a hiccup on her part.  I'd return for a meal as I saw other things that looked really good and man, the portions are huge!!!  The Factory is recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=20

Diced potatoes and carrots, few pieces of chicken and peas.  We came for my friends birthday and got her the birthday sundae; which was just a pile of whipped cream and maybe a tablespoon of ice cream. IF you come for a birthday, you have to specify that you want more to the sundae or a piece of cheesecake with a candle on it. We thought the pile of ice cream was subpar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=40
Stephanie G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",273,403,491,4.0,11/10/2015,"Mmm. Cheesecake. The decor is nice (somewhat Las Vegas casino-y? but one of the classy ones) but I like it. It is usually crowded here in my experience, and I'm sure getting closer to Christmas is only going to make that worse. Still going to have better lucky here than at the food court! I do like that they have a whole ""skinnylicious"" menu. Some restaurants have their light options and list 4-6 options. This has a lot of great choices. And as cheesecake is a requirement, it's usually best to go light for the entree. I always try to try a different cheesecake, so this time went with the 30th anniversary which is ""Layers of Our Original Cheesecake, Fudge Cake and Chocolate Truffle Cream."" It was rich and sweet without going overboard, although with the size of the slices (and the cost) you really have to share. Still every slice I've had has been so tasty but I only indulge on rare occasions.  The menu overall is a little pricey but has good variety, so it's definitely a good option if you are at the mall already and want to mix it up from the food court but it will likely be busy and some of the tables are really close together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=40
Andrea Q.,"Clifton, NJ",138,89,258,4.0,3/3/2017,"Surprisingly high rating for a chain restaurant. We came on Wednesday night at around 7:00 PM with no wait and the restaurant wasn't too crowded. For an appetizer we ordered calamari and it came out right away. The calamari itself was good but all of the breading fell off of it, so that was the downside of the calamari. My mom and I ordered the shrimp scampi combo with the herb crusted salmon. The combos are good because you can mix and match them (there are other seafood or chicken options) and the serving is worth the price of the dish ~$21. I was just sad that the scampi didn't come with angel hair pasta because that is my favorite! But it did come with a huge heaping of mashed potatoes. After our entrees came out, then we got the complimentary bread which I had been waiting for. It came when we were partially finished with our entrees but that was ok because we just took it home and I ate it for breakfast the next day lol! For dessert we ordered the macadamia nut white chocolate caramel cheesecake. It was good but I wish that the macadamia nuts were chopped into smaller pieces. Our waiter was very friendly. Overall impressed with the good service! Also, I really like that the menu has so many different options. Recently just getting into the ""super foods"" so there is a section dedicated solely to that with kale, avocado,etc. And they also have a skinnylicious menu!

She was very attentive and quick with good service. She refilled bread and drinks quickly. She also was very knowledgeable of the menu, knowing lunch sizes and if there were options we had to choose from. The atmosphere was pretty dark but the snow outside brightened up the room. The music was stuff you'd hear from a light alternative playlist on spotify. Our family ordered the ahi tartare as an appetizer and I ordered the Firecracker Salmon because I wasn't that hungry. The ahi tartare was really good. The chips were incredibly crunchy and added to the texture of the raw fish. The avocado cooled things down and added flavor to the soy ginger sauce. It had a tangy and nutty flavor to it. The firecracker salmon was pretty good. Wrapped in a crisp wrapper tied off with some spinach. The salmon was pretty good, spiced but I couldn't taste it because the spinach kind of took over the show. Otherwise the sweet hot chili sauce made up for it.

I was asked if I wanted the larger serving and I said yes. I enjoyed my meal while listening to contemporary adult music that sounds like it should be popular but isn't and watching college basketball on ESPN on tv. It was a small portion. Bland and dry pasta with a jacked up price is tough to swallow. Obviously from being hungry since I had just eaten here, I ordered the Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake.

Briaunté W.,"Queens, NY",902,519,2663,3.0,12/20/2014,"Dining with my family is always an adventure. It's very seldom that we find a place that meets all of our expectations. I'm proud to say that I'm adding TCF to that list. On a serious note everything about this place screams confusion. There's so much going on with the menu that you may come off indecisive if your waiter or waitress approaches you within 5 minutes of being seated (which our waiter did).  We started off with Tapas which consisted of Chicken Samosas, Mini Corn Dogs, & Cuban Rollers. Nothing was up to par when it came to the Tapas. My mommy ordered  the Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane as her entree. My dad ordered the Hibachi Steak as his entree. I ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp entree which wasn't good at all.  My meal was drenched in Curry Sauce & seemed as if an entire bottle of Coconut shavings was sprinkled all over my food. The Chicken & Shrimp was not served over the rice. It actually surrounded the Brown Rice that was placed in the middle of the plate. I ended up sending it back because it was painfully awful to take another bite. I couldn't pretend to enjoy my meal even if my life depended on it.  The waiter took it back without any qualms & replaced my entree with the Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane entree. My side was an order of Sweet Potato Fries. My entree was great. The only negative thing I'll say about it was the saltiness of the Sweet Potato Fries. A sprinkle of Sea Salt would've sufficed.  What's up with the extremely dim lights? I can't see what I'm ordering. I can't see what I'm eating.

And the food was fine.. The prices were a bit on the high side.. But, you should know that coming here.. Can one say they really went to the Cheesecake Factory if they left without ordering a cheesecake? I think not. After much indecision my girlfriend and I both concluded on the carrot cake cheesecake.. Very delicious.. It barely tasted like a cheesecakes.. Melted in your mouth..

Thomas W.,"Butler, NJ",644,265,1009,4.0,11/10/2013,"For a chain restaurant, Cheesecake Factory is always a solid choice.  While their menu may be very large and overwhelming, the food is always good and service is always on point.  Some people complain about the wait, but for restaurants this is usually an indicator that the restaurant is good. The service is so good here, that one time I was here with my friends and the waiter came to the table to see if we were happy with our dishes. My friend said that it wasn't what he expected.  They took the dish back and let him order something else!  No questions asked!  If that's not great service than I don't know what good service is! Like I mentioned earlier, the menu is big!  So I tend to get the same things that I know are good.   For an appetizer, get the Thai Lettuce Wraps, they are very good.  For an entree unusually get the bang bang chicken and shrimp. The seared Tuna Tataki Salad is also a good choice! Make sure that you make room for dessert cause this IS the Cheesecake Factory and Cheesecake is in the name of the place!  The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is out of this world; do it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=100

The mushrooms were 5 to a plate,  small but tasty.  Be careful on the floors, even in my sneakers they were slippery. The refill of our iced teas was done wrong.  We got the regular iced teas instead of mint.  Also,  the servers rush around,  not exactly giving you room to maneuver.  We were seated near the kitchen,  so this did not make for a pleasant experience.   Also,  we overheard the servers conversations and they said some negative things about guests--obviously not aware that they were in earshot of guests.

I have cheesecake factory food maybe twice a year and was really looking forward to the meal that I always order, the Chicken Bellagio. I was asked if I wanted the complementary bread and I said yes. I also asked for packed utensils. I could barely understand the lady taking the order and just prayed she got everything right. Got to the hotel, no bread. I most likely would have only had one slice but still, its my option if I want to eat it, I said yes when she asked and when im paying almost twenty bucks for a meal, I want the bread. I was given two forks. No knifes. The prosciutto was very thick and fatty, and pretty much uneatable. Chicken tasted almost undercooked and the worst part of it was that it was missing the parmesan cream sauce. It looked like plain oil on the bottom. I was so pissed off. Ate half of it and threw the rest away. The most prominent pars of this dish were wrong and I would have just brushed it off but it was a birthday meal and, well, it sucked so I just have to write a review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=140

But, last time I checked, the primary reason people go to restaurant is food. Service and decor is an ""add on"". Don't get me wrong. It's  certainly  helps to have all that but food should still come first.  The food is very underwhelming to say the least. 4 cheese pasta tasted bland and not at all worth $16. Avocado egg rolls were pretty good but again not worth the $11. I think you can sense the theme here. The place has mediocre food at best for ridiculous prices. Our server(Brandon) was very helpful. So I give two stars. Otherwise, I say you look somewhere else if you're in the same boat. P.s their menu prices for some items are ridiculous.

Other than that, I have nothing negative to note. - Cheesecakes are awesome!! Afterall they are the Cheesecake FACTORY right? Yea, make sure u get them, any flavors. They are not super rich or sweet and will not make you barf (even after a heavy meal). - Hibachi steak is still my fav dish after almost 5 years. It is tender, flavorful (slightly sweet), and tastes better than a $100 steak at a proper steak house. (Other notable mentions: Steak Diane, Kobe Burger, Shrimp Scampi combo) - The dark bread that they give out in the beginning is the best thing ever. I always devour on those till I'm almost full....

We started off with the stuffed mushroom  appetizer and an order of nachos . I also ordered a small snack plate which was the Greek salad . We have no complaints about the beginning of the meal because that was pretty good .  Then we ordered dinner which was a disaster and very expensive . My husband ordered the shrimp and angel hair pasta which was very very dry. There was hardly any sauce on the pasta. He had  just a bowl full of angel hair pasta and 4 shrimp. My daughter ordered the herb crusted salmon. It was flavorless and dry. The mashed potatoes that came with her dish was very dry and seemed like it came out of a box. My youngest daughter ordered the fried shrimp and french fries. The shrimp tasted like it had been fried in old burnt oil. The shrimp had too much mushy crunchy batter and was not fresh tasting at all. The food last night was just horrible.  To end our night we ordered desert.  I ordered a  strawberry cheesecake and my youngest ordered a Godiva Chocolate brownie sundae. Desert was good. No complaints with desert.  I mentioned to the waitress that my husband's  food was very dry and she just said Oh and walked away. She did nothing or asked no other questions. We got our bill which was $120.74 and of course included suggested gratuity which is super annoying after you have had bad food and mediocre service.  We paid the lowest , 15% on the receipt which was $18.11 and then we just left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=140
Michelle L.,"Livingston, NJ",210,473,145,3.0,4/14/2015,"I've been coming here for a handful of years primarily because of its central and mall location, though I haven't been in ages, until recently. Located inside Williowbrook Mall, it offers tons of seating and loads of food options. The menu is so varied, it's sometimes overwhleming. From the brunch/breakfast menu to the salads, sandwiches, pastas, entrees and drinks, not to mention their infamous cheesecake, no one can come here and say they can't find something to eat. The porions are humongous! Come here with an appetite. There's a good chance if you get an app and a meal, you'll be bringing some food home with you! The decor is nice; the same as any Cheesecake Factory (it's a chain), and the bar is large and inviting, with ample bar and table seating. What's nice about this location is the outdoor seating, albeit, it faces the mall parking lot. The service is OK; it seems a little scattered at times. Between the servers and the food runners, there's so much service, but most times it can be just too much or even too little. Its location makes it tough to get a seat at lunch and dinner hours, especially on weekends and they don't take reservations, but it's great to pop in for a bite or cocktail when you need a break from shopping! And of course, don't forget a piece of cheesecake, even if you have to take it home.

The variety on the menu is great though, and there are a lot of items to pick from if you don't eat meat. Love their smoothies, I get one every time and they really fill you up (which makes it hard to finish meals sometimes, haha). Went the other day and was helped by Stephanie, who was super awesome. We had a hard time choosing what we wanted and needed extra time and she was really nice about it. In general, I just wish they would give us a few more minutes before approaching us so that we'd have enough time to look through the menu. Also, the lighting in the restaurant needs to be brighter.

Christopher W.,"Nutley, NJ",54,238,42,3.0,6/20/2014,"I guess I could summarize this quickly.  The tap beer selection was small.  The appetizer selections were numerous and varied and quite good.  The entrees were poorly-executed.  The desserts were very large.  Portions tend to be good values overall.  The service was phenomenal. In detail: the steak was burned on the outside.  Medium-well is not an excuse to add charcoal to the steak.  The fish tacos had no flavor; various alternative sauces and apologies were administered to no success.  The quintessential picky-child ""pasta with garlic butter and Parmesan"" option tasted off, due to the cheese (too smoky). The Tots were tasty; the Cuban sandwich appetizer was terrific and well-worth a second try.  The battered Buffalo chicken was good, interesting in its execution.  The Ahi Carpaccio was a good try but the soy and guacamole didn't cut it for me.   The brownie sundae was too large by half, and so much whipped cream to avoid.  Overly rich.  Just not for me and my male endocrine system.  The apple crisp was a much better choice but too big for my son.  On reflection it would serve our family of four. I expected more tap choices for beer; in fact, I expected many craft beers but I guess that's not what CF is all about.  I didn't go wrong with a Sam Adams Seasonal -- no one ever has. The water flowed freely and service was very attentive, polite, apologetic of our concerns and lent the third star to the review.   In all, this reminded me of a diner with a grander vision than it could properly execute.  The service was outstanding, literally standing apart from many other dining experiences in the last year.  So, perhaps with a different mindset I'd return, but it's not likely.  Too many other local choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=140

It could have used more chicken but it was still really good. I highly recommend this location!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=80

Luckily we got seated pretty quickly, but where we sat wasn't really preferred. It was against a wall and I felt crammed and hidden. Once we sat down, the waitress didn't come to say hello or get our drink orders for a really long time. We picked our drinks, meal and even what dessert to get and she still wasn't there. Once she took our complete order she brought our drinks in less than 2 minutes which was great. Our food came out in less than 20 minutes but they messed up my simple order by adding something I said to leave out. They did take it back and fix it relatively quickly. The manager came to apologize and ask if I wanted a salad or something in the mean time for the inconvenience. I have to say that meant a lot that he came over to apologize, because it was brought to his attention that my order was messed up.  The food was really good once we got to eat. My boyfriend loves his barbecue burger and I got the four cheese penne. Our next order he got cheesecake and I got the sundae and the portion was huge. I felt my brownie could of been softer but I'll always order the Godiva sundae. It was the best dessert I've ever had and of course my boyfriend loved his cheesecake.

It's hard to screw up an omelette right? Wrong. Not only did they forget to cook my omelette and I got my meal after all my friends were already halfway done but they never brought me toast. I ended up just eating the bread and butter they put on the table in the beginning of the meal admit dinner. The omelette had a really bad taste to it. I'm thinking the spinach was old and slimy.

Crystine W.,"New York, NY",752,1201,281,4.0,10/31/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is one notch above other retail restaurants such as Applebee's and TGIF's, bringing in better food made with quality ingredients, a clean and upscale look (servers wear all-white) and top-notch service.  The best part is, they don't overcharge that much.  For a similar-quality meal in NYC, I'd definitely be paying at least double what I pay at the Cheesecake Factory.  Plus they make the best cheesecake too (beating out any Eileen's and Junior's that I've had).   I come here frequently and have tried quite a bit from the extensive menu.  Most memorable are the Thai Lettuce Wraps, Pasta Evelyn and the Chicken Madeira.  The Lettuce Wraps are a heaping mound of marinated grilled chicken, bean sprouts, carrots, pickled cucumbers and a trio of sauces.   I recently tried the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and found that really isn't to my liking, but that's probably the only thing I don't like of all the things I've tried.  For cheesecakes, you just can't go wrong with the Pumpkin (or Pumpkin Pecan) or the Dulce de Leche slices.   Each bite is heavenly, especially if you're a fan of cheesecake to begin with.   If you have allergies, the server goes out of their way to make sure that ingredient can't be found in anything you ordered.  This is a good place for celebrations, a nice date, families, casual catch-up, brunch.  They really are able to cater to everyone else's needs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=120
Chavon W.,"West Orange, NJ",18,30,3,1.0,3/4/2015,"Worst experience ever! I visited this Cheesecake factory with my family, on a week night last week. First, the server was not attentive and seemed disinterested in serving us. Some of our utensils and bread plates had dried food on them. Then, when we asked for hot water to at least feel better about the rest of them, the server seemed to not care what was wrong. Then, my cajun jambalaya was an oily mess. It was the worst ever, and I ALWAYS order the cajun jambalaya. When I told the server that I didn't want it, she took the plate away without even asking ""why"" or ""if she could get me anything else"".  Finally, as we were leaving, I stood at the hostess stand watching the hostess and 3 other employees engage in a spirited, and obviously personal, conversation. After about 5 minutes, the hostess comes over and asks me if I would like a table for 2. I said no, I'd like a manager. She gave me a generic, restaurant business card, with no name or anything else.

I love cheesecake factory n go there atleast twice or thrice in A year. It's alwsys a big occasion for its top go to cheese cake factory bit I have been craving for cheesecake now for a while. So lady night I decided I want have coffee with some cheese cake n a girly talk. As usual this place is awesome.   Let's talk about the resturant first.  It's amazing setting n ambience is perfect for a drink,  date night or just some girl talk.  Not to bright not to dark just perfect in romantic way.  Hehe. There is a bar area which is self seated. It's pretty big area. Drinks are awesome n usual at other bars. TVs in bar area where u can sit n watch games.   Service- I always experienced a good service whenever I go. They are so busy at times but they make sure to give their customers best service.  There are managers walking around making sure customers are being helped.  Waiters are all dressed in white n a so nice n peaceful.  The one who served us last night,  his name was andrew. A very nice man who was so polite to us. He got us waters n deserts. He kept checking on us from time to tone of we were ok n need something.  He also told us  that he is serving other tables which was big but if we need anything just call for him.  That thought was very considerate.  Food!- i know food here is awesome,  no matter what u order.  I always get the little egg rolls things worn this green chutney ...Mmmmm delicious.  I love threw green chutney perfect! . My fav is Sante fe salad with chicken with that green chutney. They have lot of other choice in food which are delicious. Let's move to Deseret,  best thing about cheesecake.  I usually order the double chocolate tall tower cake. Mmmmm personally I love chocolaty n so good. But late night we decided to order white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. It's little lemony n has this little hint of crunchyness in it. I b loved it.  Also ordered triamusu,  which as usual was good.  Cheesecake factory makes the best cakes n cheesecakes ever.

He walked very slow without a care in the world. When I finally got the coffee, first he slammed it on the table and then I asked him if he gave me cream or milk, he said to me, ""I don't know, you find out."" Wow!!!! So professional of him!!!! It was five of us and everyone in my table was unhappy with his attitude and rudeness. We didn't wanna make a scene there or address the issue.

My family and I had never been here before and rather than hitting Red Lobster like we always usually do, we decided to check this place out to see if it was anything like the one up in Boston that we'd go to when I was a student up there. And it was. It definitely was. Same inner decor which is hip and nice, and a HUGE menu that always makes it nearly impossible to decide on anything because there's just so much delicious sh*t. I finally settled on angel hair pasta with shrimp, my dad has fish and chips, and mom had Indian samosas with a beet salad. All very tasty, though my mom said the fries weren't crispy enough. Very good and attentive and friendly service. Only downside, it did all turn out to be more expensive than what was originally estimated and although we had a great tasty time, the food is not quite deserving of those prices.

Tudii N.,"West Orange, NJ",19,28,10,1.0,4/3/2015,Not a good time. Most over rated place. I was really craving a steak when I came in so I ordered the coulette steak medium well. The steak came out bleeding. I couldn't report it to my server until she came over 15 mins later. She took it back to be cooked more. It came out 10 mins later- COLD everything oh wait and still bleeding in not sure what exactly they did. A manager didn't come over to apologize or anything and I asked for A1 sauce and they didn't have any! What?! That's like serving French fries and having no ketchup?! I couldn't believe it and I was pissed off. $85 bill for a shitty steak and a decent burger. The seating of the place is set up that you can't even have a personal conversation with anyone ur with. Because someone else is sitting directly beside you and you don't even know them. No place to hang your jacket so everything is bunched up near your neighboring diner with another servers butt in your face. Our server didn't pre bus unless I asked her to and when I did she took two small plates and left the rest to clutter. -_-  I had to move all of our dishes to a nearby table. Then at the end we asked for a refill of lemonade. She asked for the the old cup he has the first lemonade out of. I told her it was removed from the table. Then she said we couldn't get a refill without the original cup. WHAT?!  she said she will get it anyway and came back with a small togo cup. That was it for us. She lucky she got a tip to be honest.

The waitress and manager were both extremely rude and unprofessional. I have a United States I.D. so I was able to order a glass of wine, but the waitress refused to let us have it at our table because my boyfriend did not have a US I.D. even though he had other forms of I.D. and is clearly a grown man. I went up to the bar and got the wine myself and the waitress had the nerve to argue with me about it. She wanted to take away the wine I had just bought at the bar, even though I had my United States I.D. She seemed to just want to pick a fight. At this point, I asked for another server because she seemed to personally have it out for us and was denying me what I ordered and paid for. Soon after we saw her telling the new server about what happened, but I ended up being nice to my new server. She was fine, and I tipped well like I always do. Basically, I felt like my boyfriend was discriminated against and then on top of that, the workers were petty and unprofessional. I haven't gone back because of this incident.

The service is consistently good, and you can tell that Cheesecake Factory recruits and trains well. We had one handicapped person...very accommodating. Desserts are a favorite with some family members. Tip:  Ask the price of any specials to avoid surprises. I ordered catfish, pecan crusted with two sides...most excellent for $17. Tip 2:  Call ahead to ask about wait times. Can be over an hour at peak times. Drinks are generally over-priced compared with the price of the meal.

I was seated right away and greeted with a warm smile by one of the waitresses, her name was Michele, with one ""L"", we made made a joke about that, so I would refer to her as ""Michele with one L"" whenever I saw her. I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, and also ordered one of my favorite meals there, Shepherd's Pie. Everything was delicious, and I was quite stuffed. ""Don't forget to leave room for Cheesecake!"" Said Michele with one ""L"". Well, how could I not listen to that wonderful advice! As I looked through the menu, Michele with one ""L"" noticed I was struggling, I am after all, very indecisive. She recommended the new Salted Caramel Cheesecake, so I decided to go for it! I tell you this, I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times, and that was perhaps the best Gosh darn cheesecake I have ever had! After I licked my plate clean, Michele with one ""L"" once again, with that same wonderful smile, asked me how everything was, and I of course simply replied: ""PERFECT"".

Avocado rolls are tasty, Chicken skewers are good, the Fried Cat Fish is so/so it gets too salty after a few bites and I can't finish it, the Crab Wontons are absolutely delicious , Chicken Parm sandwich is pretty good and the quesadilla is good. The Dulce de Leche hot chocolate is alright, like I can make it better at home, and the Piña Colada is good. The ambience is sort of noisy, but I like to come here when I'm in the mood to eat and talk freely, without feeling like no on else is being loud. Reasonable food and reasonable pricing .Cheesecakes are pretty tall and slices are around $8 bucks give or take a few bucks lower or higher depending on which cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=180

Thomas R.,"Montclair, NJ",101,3,,1.0,6/22/2010,"One may consider Cheesecake Factory a gem for delicious quick and reasonable chain restaurant Food, and it is.  My first Cheesecake Factory experience was in Houston, Texas - and I fell in love.  Never before had I enjoyed chain restaurant food, or selection.  When this Cheesecake Factory started hiring I considered putting my name in. But disaster struck when I was visiting the Cheesecake factory with 6 of my friends. We sat there, and a cockroach was crawling across the bench seating.  I informed the waitress of the roach, she said she would send the manager over, the waitress came back minutes later and the manager had not.  Even our waitress was showing frustration with the manager not coming by.  When he did, he tried to offer us a free dessert.  I'm not sure if that is just instinct for dealing with issues, but I do not want to eat more food at a place I just saw a insect capable of mechanically transmitting disease organisms such as the bacteria which cause food poisoning. As disgusting as that is, I feel the bigger issue is I posted a status on Facebook of simply ""Guess who's never going back to the Cheesecake Factory"" and multiple friends commented of their experience with cockroaches at this same Cheesecake Factory.

It could easily feed 2 adults. And the cheesecake, well, I don't even have to tell you that. It's the whole reason they exist and yes its good! This Cheesecake happens to be attached to the Willowbrook Mall and because it is so, it is ALWAYS A ZOO. I have waited as long as 3 hours to get a table on a Thursday night!

Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,493,33,4.0,9/5/2009,"The burgers were really good here. Came here for lunch on a Friday. The place was a little bit less than half full. There was parking in the lots outside, which makes sense because this Cheesecake Factory is part of the WillowBrook mall.  We were seated almost immediately upon arriving around 12 p.m. The server was very polite and rattled off the specials without a blink. We opted to get bread for the table (must be a cost-saving measure since they used to just bring the bread as opposed to asking if you wanted bread).  I ordered the Kobe burger (with friend mushrooms and caramelized onions) and my husband ordered the double stacker BBQ burger. They came with either fries or a salad, and we both opted for the fries. The burger was AMAZING. Both of them. The highlight of the burger was actually the toasted bun. Perfectly toasted so that the buttered inside was crunchy and added amazing texture. I asked for my Kobe burger ($13) to be cooked medium, but it came out well done. That being said, the texture of the meat was amazingly tender and juicy. Must have been because of the Kobe meat. The mushroom and onions did add to the burger, but not in a significant way (except to break up the texture).  I was told that the BBQ burger was also exceptional. It was ""what the Big Mac should have been.""  Since this burger ($11.50) was listed as a ""double stacker,"" we both expected the burger to have two beef patties. What we did not expect was for the patties to be separated by another piece of bread. That being said, the burger was cooked perfectly (also ordered it cooked medium), and the crunchy breaded thin onion rings they placed in the burger added significantly to the texture of the burger. There were two large strips of bacon and one slice of melted cheese. The fries were only mediocre because they were pretty dry. They likely cooked too long in the oil, or sat for too long under the hot plate. The service was polite and efficient. They brought out new glasses of water (unasked) when we finished our first. The second refill, I had to ask for, but I also asked for mayo for my burger and that was brought swiftly. The restaurant was a little chilly inside, but it was over-all, a very good experience. The portions are very large, but since the fries weren't very good, there was nothing worth doggy-bagging. It was a pretty expensive burger, but the great taste was worth it. Lastly, they will be running a promotion from Oct to Dec. where you get a free slice of cheesecake with an order over $30 (which can easily happen if you get an appetizer and entree). They bring you the coupon for this promotion at the end of your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=240

Mortimer C.,"Newark, NJ",4,3,1,1.0,12/6/2011,"By no means am I a big complainer and when I eat out I'm usually fine with what I receive.  As a General Manager of a Chipotle Mexican Grill I can appreciate situations where guests can be difficult so I don't want to be that person.  My lady and I ate at Cheesecake Factory together close to 10 yrs ago for the first time.  The meal was great, portions fantastic!!  I had the shepherds pie and it didn't disappoint.  When our first dinner choice was not available I suggested Cheesecake Factory.   So we go there and we sit and peruse the menu.  Now mind you on the first page of the menu they go on and on about the generous portions blah blah, so I'm thinking about what to order and we decided on the spinach and cheese dip with tortilla chips  $11.00.  We get the smallest bowl of dip, I'd say a four inch by four inch by two inch deep bowl 75% filled.  Not terrible but you would expect more from a place saying their appetizers are huge...It was flavorful so we over looked that. On to the entree lol if you would call it that.  I decided on the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane combo she ordered the Shrimp Scampi.  We waited and when our server brought our food we were amazed at what was placed before. Now when I ordered the combo I was thinking yeah this should be good and filling so I'm eager to eat.  Boy was I in for a shock!!   My over a foot long oval plate had three of the smallest bites of steak on one side with some mushrooms and onion with three shrimp all they way on the other side.  Now for $21( a dollar extra for sweet potato fries lol) I would expect a decent portion not the paltry amount of food I received!!  Hers too, big plate with five shrimp exactly and a small mound of pasta!!  I can't tell you how many other place you could eat at and spend $21 and get twice the amount of food of equal or better quality.Total let down and I know things are tight in this economy but that was just wrong how they did us!! So to sum it all up,  one guinness, pina colada and appetizer $27.. one Steak and shrimp combo and shrimp scampi $42..... two pieces of cheesecake for $16 a bill for $92!!!  and two people that will never return to this ripoff restaurant.........Priceless!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=240

Anyway, as it happened, I was on my way back from a day trip in Sussex County and had very few late-night options. So... Cheesecake Factory, here we come. My wife, niece, and I experienced some food quality problems with beef sliders (a shared appetizer) and Thai chicken pasta (a shared entree). I won't bore you with the details, because they honestly weren't severe and I was prepared to happily ignore them. But... when the manager heard about the problems, she came over to the table, apologized, and - without hesitation - comped the whole meal. EVERYTHING. FREE. Then she bought us three desserts and coffees on the house. Her name is Janice and her genuine friendliness and customer orientation made us forget all about the minor hiccups. Seriously, she's a great ambassador for the brand. Are you listening Mr. Cheesecake? The truth is that I'm unlikely to go to any Cheesecake Factory again (because I prefer not to eat in a factory). However, for those who like to get a week's worth of sodium in a single appetizer... for those who have never actually tasted Thai food... and for those whose mouths are so big that a full-sized hamburger feels like a ""slider""...

Andrea D.,"New York, NY",0,5,,5.0,3/10/2015,"Being in New York I couldn't imagine ending my trip without going to the Cheesecake Factory. I wanted to know what hype about it was. But trust me each and every word of appreciation I have heard in my entire life was true. There is no match to the flavor that I experienced at this amazing place. I can literally still remember the taste of the cheesecakes I had. I went to the CCF with 6 friends, so we decided to order several cheesecakes and share them. We had the white chocolate raspberry, banana cream, oreo, Dulce de leche, strawberry, cherry and the tuxedo cheesecake. Tuxedo was on the heavy side but the other ones were memorable, especially the strawberry one (well for my friends the oreo and the banana cream ones were the finest). It was a cheesecake party, seven people and seven different cheesecakes. The prices were totally worth the flavors. I would recommend it to anyone who is in Los Angeles to definitely visit this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=220

Carmela R.,"New York, NY",17,71,,4.0,5/25/2010,"*This review is specifically for the lunch I had on Sunday, May, 23rd* I'm in such a great mood, having fun watching American Idol finale and enjoying my very first elite badge (yay 2010), so I'm in a generous mood giving Cheesecake Factory a 4 star rating when probably they are deserving of more like a 3 to 3 and half star one.  Plus, I've had several happy times here with family, so, I could be a bit biased.  Having said that, yeah, yeah, I know how many of y'all feel about chain establishments, but I rather like the CF. Been coming to this location since they opened several years ago. CF is inside the Willowbrook Mall, so after a day of shopping, my sis and usually one or two of my nieces would take a load off needing post shopping fuel.  Each time I've been here, the staff has been pleasant and attentive. A small gripe: when they are as busy as they are on weekends especially, they can be a tad bit neglectful in wiping the seats clean. Tables are always clean though and reset for the next diners. Warm breadbasket arrives at the table with butter. A pumpernickel oat bread and a sourdough one. We had the lunch special that's offered until 5pm. My niece had a mini pizza (but big enough to share). I forgot the name of the pizza, but I can describe it. It had cheese, fresh basil and sliced tomatoe (no sauce) thin crust and was pretty good. It was accompanied with a caesar salad. Salad was well balanced with italian cheese shavings and dark leafy greens and not saturated in dressing. Sis and I had a barbeque chicken salad which was very good. It was a mix of greens, black beans, corn, avocado and white juicy chicken breast meat chunks, tomatoes and red onions. It was flavorful and zesty with a barbeque sauce finish. We passed on dessert, but my sis and I had a cappuccino that was just okay. Not enough substantial foam for my taste and the espresso  bean was just okay- a bit thin and weak. They were decaf though, so this could have made a difference. Perhaps the regular capps are stronger and more full bodied. At $5 a pop, I expected more. Although, it was served in a large mug more suited for a latte. So, in a sense, it was a generous serving.  The ambiance of this CF has a pleasantly attractive decor of earthy muted tones and dark wood furniture and lighter beige tables. The pillow bench chairs against the wall are comfortable if that's where you sit, or if you are on the isle, strong wicker comfortable chairs with arms will secure your tush comfortably and your back too. The lighting is on the dim side. The bathrooms were pretty clean and decently attractive.  People woo about the entrees. Some of which one would experience in top tier chef restaurants for quadruple the price just because you are in a trendy hot spot run by a popular chef.  To the right of us, I saw a couple's entree. A salmon dish with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. The other entree looked like a good, hearty steak.  At another table I saw a woman eating a salisbury steak dish that looked appetizing with a fresh spinach side dish. While The Cheesecake Factory can be hit or miss at times (especially on weekends when they are super busy), I tend to feel a person will experience more hits than misses.  Oh, and both popular and pretty are the array of drinks from their full bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=220
Kathy A.,"Totowa, NJ",1,42,,4.0,11/7/2013,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory for the first time in a awhile, we had a gift card. It had a decent crowd for a Tuesday night.

R C.,"Clifton, NJ",0,12,,4.0,1/15/2015,"Very friendly staff and good food. There was ALOT of people during the weekend, but it is a chain restaurant in the mall, so I understood. Considering the time I went, the wait was not too bad. I had the Louisiana chicken pasta which was actually really good, but just wish it came out when it was a little warmer. Other than that, overall it was a pleasant meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=220
Amy N.,"Wanaque, NJ",0,4,,1.0,6/4/2014,"I've always liked cheesecake factory and never had any real issues with any of the locations I've visited. As of tonight I can tell you I will never go back to the one at Willowbrook mall in Wayne. I was craving some sort of sweet dessert so my boyfriend and I decided this would be a great place to go; he could get dinner and I could satisfy my sweet tooth.  We were seated right away but it took the waiter a good 5-10 minutes to come over and grunt at us - yes,  he actually grunted. He was completely miserable the entire time we were there. Inattentive, rude, and absentee are the nicest ways to describe the service. Then there was the food, the only thing that wasn't awful was my chocolate milkshake. I ordered the apple crisp, and was not impressed in the slightest. Mostly nuts and whipped cream with very little apple or what is usually added for ""crisp"". My boyfriend got the pan seared salmon with angel hair pasta. He was nice enough to wait for my food to get to the table before he started eating, unfortunately this lead to another 10 minute wait and his food being almost cold by the time he got to eat it. The pasta was definitely microwaved, clumped together, dry, and completely disgusting. The salmon was ok, but not well cooked by any means.  When the waiter asked how everything was, we told him about the issue with the pasta. Wet got another grunt, no apology, and he walked away. We figured a manager would be forthcoming at that point, and he was, again after a decent (15 minute) wait. The manager sort of half assedly apologized but explained that if the pasta stays in the window too long waiting to be delivered it gets dry and can stick. When the bill came we were shocked to see that we were still being charged the full $17 for his meal - even though half of it had been inedible.  Between the terrible service and the bad food, nothing could get me back into this restaurant. We actually ended up going straight to Chipotle afterward so my boyfriend could eat dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=220
Sean K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1290,212,1657,5.0,2/4/2010,"If there's one chain restaurant missing in Manhattan, it's a Cheesecake Factory. I'm still shocked over the fact that there is not one of these throughout the 5 boroughs. Cheesecake Factory is the most delicious, consistently good chain restaurant you can possibly go to. Being from Florida, I've been to CF dozens of times. The Miso Salmon is cooked BEAUTIFULLY, and flavored perfectly with a Miso-based sauce, served over a bed of rice. The Chicken Madeira is another great CF classic. The desserts are great, of course, as well. Still my favorite Shrimp Scampi as well, beautifully breaded shrimp in an amazing sauce with great, al dente angel hair. If there;s one restaurant Times Square' restaurant need to be worried about, it's a Cheesecake Factory. CF Would put all of those touristy places out faster than any other establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=220
Mike M.,"Paramus, NJ",0,8,,4.0,12/6/2014,Most of my Cheesecake Factory experiences have been good.  This time I had the Cajun Chicken Littles.  Not spicy at all and kind of dry.  Mashed potatoes and bread were good though and the waitress provided good service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-wayne?start=220
