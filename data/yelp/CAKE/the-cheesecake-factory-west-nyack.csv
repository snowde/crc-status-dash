Mark Nowell M.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",98,101,191,4.0,12/10/2017,"Perfect for the family! Must try food and cheesecake place! Location: It is located in the ground level of Palisades Mall. A lot of seating if you go early! Intimate for the family! Service: The service is always amazing! They don't hurry you and gives you recommendations!  Food: Renee's special is a regular turkey sub, the salad that comes with if does not have any dressing, the soup is so good tho reminds me of clam chowder. The carbonara pasta is good, very creamy and noodles cook perfectly. Seared tuna tataki salad is good for the salad lover out there, comes with perfectly seasoned tuna. My favorite is the Combination of steak Diane and herb crusted salmon with asparagus and mashed potato, it's a taste of two of their best sellers in one plate. Price rating: 6 out of 10. Price is okay. Recommended for the family, a lot of seating and variety of food! Try all their cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack
Kevin M.,"Buchanan, NY",12,3,,2.0,1/7/2018,"Met my cousins for brunch at 12 on a Sunday  Place was not crowded at the time . Lights were set to dim  From the time we sat to the time brunch came out was 1 hour 45 min  We had 6 people all wanted coffee we asked for milk and cream - only one small ""shot cup"" of each  We all had about 3 cups of coffee each while awaiting food and each time after coffee was left we had to ask for more milk and cream Each time waitress brought coffee - never removed any of old cups  We kept shuffling them around  When food finally arrives 1 one order was wrong and had to be sent back - she said 5-10 min 25 min later pancakes came out and she never brought out syrup  When we asked she brought out a shot cup of syrup - my cousin who is a waitress couldn't eat anymore because she was aggravated  Myself , my cousin and my sister are all in the service business so we deal with customers each day  She may have been New we cut ""some"" slack but we left at 2:45pm , my sister had dinner plans in 2 hours after that  Was frustrating trying to catch up with family which is hard enough in this day and age with the busy schedules we all have but most of the time we were complaining about the horrible service  Sad -  Food was not great either I had eggs Benedict and Canadian bacon was dry as well as the English muffin  We will probably not go back again or it will be a Very long time if we all do  We didn't order dessert because like I said my sister had dinner arrangement only 2 hours later and dessert probably would just be coming out",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack
Karen L.,"Putnam County, NY",12,251,424,4.0,10/13/2017,"Typical Cheesecake Factory food. It was good. No complaints. We started with the fried zucchini sticks and ranch dipping sauce. Yum!!  I ordered the pineapple shrimp and chicken with brown rice. It was good.  My sister had a mango avocado salad?  She was satisfied and like it. We finished off with a piece of cheesecake which was thick, creamy, velvety, and smooth. Delish! Major tip:  not a fan of the white bread. Request the brown bread with oat flakes. Much better choice.  I do want to add that they changed the menu and got rid of my favorite meal so I am still annoyed over that. Bring back the chicken costoletta Please!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack
Roy H.,"Spring Valley, NY",6,67,112,4.0,11/10/2017,"I've never had a bad experience here. Food is always good. Dessert is always amazing. Today I tried the Mac N Cheese Cheeseburger and it was AMAZING!!  Had the side salad instead of fries. Too filled up for dessert but I wanna come back and try the Celebration Cheesecake that's on the menu Meal portions are usually quite big here and will fill you up, or take the rest home. Or split.

Alicia B.,"Floral Park, NY",5,86,65,2.0,4/23/2017,"This was my first visit to one of their chain restaurants.  My first issue upon arriving at around 8PM on Sunday, was they barely had any seating( to wait for a booth). I was told by a host I could wait outside but they would not come out there to call me. No big deal I went out, and came in when a family got up.  Upon being seated, my table was clean, and neat. Though I highly disliked my silverware being on the surface of the table and out in the open, especially since there was a fly ( tell you more in a bit). Dana was my server, I let her know it was my first visit, and asked what she recommended, she thought chicken Marsala. I ordered the combination of chicken Marsala and shrimp scampi. When she returned to drop bread, she literally didn't not stop at the table, it was one motion, keep walking and place the bread on the table . When she returned with water for my toddler, it was in a glass. When she dropped my coffee, it was room temp.  To make this experience even more adventurous, when my food came, the portion wasn't even enough to fill my toddler. I literally had a boneless chicken breast with two stalks of asparagus, mushroom madness, and 3 SHRIMPS PLACED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLATE( IS THIS A MEAL???). Nonetheless it was nice to try something new, and the flavors were nice, not overly salty like every other chain restaurant I've been to (sole reason for a second star, first was for cleanliness) I requested a hotter coffee for a refill, an apple juice for my son (came in a kids cup this time). My requests were honored, and I greatly appreciated it. THEN THERE WAS A FLY! (See photos) it was on my son's pizza, then my plate... & I was done, I requested my check and wanted nothing more. She was much nicer and patient, and actually stopped walking at the end, than she was at the beginning.  I'm highly disappointed, and I felt like I had to babysit the process.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack
Lana S.,"New York, NY",12,71,290,5.0,8/27/2017,"We love the Cheesecake Factory, but not every location has the same service or quality of food. Our server, Tabia, was stellar. She checked on us every 10-15 minutes, made sure our water was always full and even got our children a bread plate with sliced bananas--on the house! I was feeding my son puréed food out of a personal jar, and she offered to wash it for me. Children's plates are very generous, we ordered children's pizza for my daughter and she barely ate half. My husband and I got the Mexican tortilla salad. Our favorite item on the menu. Definitely recommend this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack

Linnex M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,6,4.0,10/14/2017,I love love love this place! The menu is absolutely endless. It ranges from tacos to burgers to pasta and sandwiches. Let's not forget to talk about the cheesecake. I had the Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake but my boyfriend had the Original strawberry cheesecake and they were both amazing. The dining utensils were a little dirty we had to ask for some new ones. The waiter was okay but he could have interacted more. The food overall was everything and the wait wasn't as long as told.

Lisa A.,"Lodi, NJ",415,338,505,2.0,3/6/2017,"Ugh first and last time eating here.  We had a $100 gift card and decided to come here on a Saturday night to use it up.   I knew it was going to be busy, but I didn't expect the mayhem that ensued.  The lobby, bar, and entire restaurant was absolutely packed and the wait for two people was over an hour.  Who waits that long? Luckily, we found a space at the bar and decided to stay there the night.  We ordered a few drinks and some appetizers.  We ordered the shrimp rolls and the kale salad.  They brought out the wrong appetizer and the bartender gave us so much attitude and acted like it was our fault.  The kale salad was way overpriced for what you get.  For entrees we both went with the hibachi steak.  This was actually really good and the highlight of our night (the only thing that warranted a second star).  I went to the bathroom before I left and it was absolutely disgusting.  So bad that I couldn't even bring myself to use it.  There were huge piles of water (or other liquids) in each stall.  The toilets and floors were so dirty and disgusting.   Needless to say, I will not be back here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack

Katie S.,"New York, NY",201,236,299,3.0,1/30/2017,"Have eaten here probably 15 times over the past 10 years on trips to the Palisades Mall with my family. It's a solid three-star place with consistently good food, service that can sometimes be quite slow and imperfect, and almost always a wait for a table, especially on weekends. The good:  - Food is reliable and menu, as at all CF locations, is huge, so it's easy for everyone to find many things that appeal to them. - The space is huge, so it's a good place for groups. - Cheesecake to-go counter is usually quick and efficient. The bad: - We're almost always there on a Saturday midday, and there's always a wait. This past Saturday, we waited for 35 minutes for a table for 3. When our table was ready, we were led to the back to a table along a banquette -- where there were 5+ empty tables for 2, despite lots of other waiting parties. Not sure if they're understaffed or if they just didn't have any waiting parties for 2, but we were wondering if there was some reason they weren't pushing tables together to shorten the wait. - Service can be hit or miss. At our meal on Saturday, our appetizer came out right away, but we had to wait almost 20 minutes for entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack

Service was awful and no quality check when the food were served to our table, the food were over cooked, re-fried sweet potatoes fries, late bring bread, etc. And some dishes were came very late!  What a disappointment to my & friend's kids.

Steve K.,"CORTLANDT MNR, NY",56,525,1726,4.0,12/10/2016,"Met friends here from Florida. We met in bar area during Happy Hour. Location is Palisades Center closer to Route 59 entrance with an outside entrance next to Bed Bath & Beyond and Macy's. Generally, we avoid all chain dining but The Cheesecake Factory is consistently one of the better chains. * Friendly, attentive staff. Menu is huge, with something for everyone. Our experience was overall better than most reviewers here. * We chose mostly from the Happy Hour menu. Especially enjoyed Avocado Eggrolls with Dipping Sauce, Chicken Pot Stickers (would have preferred pork) with Soy-Ginger-Sesame Sauce, and Roadside Sliders. * For Happy Hour drinks, our group chose 16oz brewskies on draught, house bourbon of Jack Daniels, and Margaritas. Mojitos and Cosmopolitans also available. * Also enjoyed entrées of Stuffed Chicken Tortillas and Lemon Grilled Salmon Happy Hour Alert:  Like most places these days, Happy Hour applies only in the bar area. Limited seating in that area for 4 people. We hung out at the bar for 15 mins until one of the bar area tables opened up. Happy Hour Monday-Friday only. Promotion Alert:  Free Cheesecake with purchase of a gift card in 2016. Gripe:  Don't know if this is management carelessness or malicious deceitfulness. Bill included suggested tip levels of 15, 18, 20 and 22%. No problem with that. But tip calculation included state sales tax resulting in tip miscalculation. Huh? Mathematically challenged?

There were 3 of us and we chose, Cuban rolls, zucchini sticks, mozzarella sticks, chicken lettuce wraps and Cajun jambalaya . The food was phenomenal portions generous so we decided to bring half home and get dessert. We got Godiva cheesecake and carrot cake. They have the best carrot cake in the county!

Linda N.,"Albertson, NY",0,34,10,1.0,6/23/2016,"I really wish I could give zero stars. We went to this location last weekend and the service was hella slow. We were a party of 2 adults and 4 children. Instead of going to the food court for lunch we thought it would be better to have the kids contained in one place so we chose Cheesecake Factory.  Big mistake. Here are just a few reasons why I won't be returning to his location EVER again.  1. For one, I think they seated parties that came in AFTER us first. Not cool. When I went up to the counter to ask, they said we had not been called yet (we took the kids to the restrooms while we waited and there were more people who weren't there when we came in).  2. When they finally seated us, I asked the hostess if they had any crayons and activity paper to occupy the children as we waited. Nope, but I can give you some paper and pen, she said. What kind of family friendly establishment doesn't have at least crayons for the kids??  3. Our server, Dean, introduced himself and took our drink orders. All seemed well until he brought us a drink (seltzer) with remnants of what appeared to be chocolate syrup in bottom of the glass from its prior use.--GROSS! When he brought it to his attention, he quickly apologized and looked intent on replacing it. He disappeared for a good while until we got another. Meanwhile the first one just sat at the end of the table. He didn't bother to remove it even when he brought the new one. We had to ask him to remove it!  4. Then it took some time till he got over to us to take our orders and when he did, he seemed flustered..a box of cigarettes hanging loosely out of his smock. He was fumbling to find a pen and pad and in the midst of doing that the pack of smokes fell out of his smock. My friend's 7 year old went and picked it up for him.  5. I don't know exactly how long it took to get our food finally but it took a long time. The kids were complaining of hunger and we adults were not having a ball either. We arrived at 11:30 and didn't leave there until 1:30. We ate our food real fast when it came to us. We literally spent more time sitting and waiting than eating.  When we were looking for our server, he was nowhere to be found. We asked for more bread because the kids were starving and even that took a while. By the time the food came, they had filled up on bread. Imagine how long it took to get the check. I couldn't leave there quick enough.

Of course I was last for him to ask me what I wanted.  Then the food comes mine is last one to come. My friends pork shop was raw still bleeding needles to say he ask them to cook it abit  longer.

Shirley W.,"Pine Brook, NJ",15,8,6,1.0,10/15/2017,"Went there last night at 9:30. Hostess seated us at 9:40p. We were a party of 4. Our server Alfredo took our drink orders then came over with another server (Lisa) and told us we were going to be taken care of by her since he was to go on break. Lisa visited our table twice more. Once to check and again to take our orders. After this we did not see Lisa again at all and were abandoned. We are not demanding people and our orders were pretty basic. An avocado salad w shrimp, a bacon cheeseburger (medium) w fries, a steak taco platter (onions & chipotle sauce on the side as onions trigger migraines on me in large quantities and chipotle sauce on the side as I wanted to test the heat level on the sauce before eating it), the last order was fish tacos (with chipotle sauce on the side). Well... this is where the entire experience went downhill. We waited about 30 minutes. A staff member came with food in a bag and said ""here's the shrimp scampi!"" All in our table w puzzled looks on our faces said to her ""we haven't even gotten our food yet!"" She stated ""well I'll just leave this here"" and left the bag at our table and walked off. We were all left puzzled. About 5 minutes after this, the same girl brought 2 of the platters for our party. The bacon cheeseburger & the avocado salad. We waited for about 15 minutes then Alfredo resurfaced asking if everything was ok. We pointed at the table and stated 2 of us didn't even get our food! He shook his head and apologized and went off to find out what happened. At this point the manager visited our table for the first time apologizing & stated he would take the 2 taco platters off our bill. Shortly after this the fish taco platter made it to our table. Chipotle sauce was not on the side as ordered but the member of our party ate it nevertheless as she was now too hungry. Still no steak taco platter. At 10:55p the steak taco platter finally arrived. Not seeing onions or chipotle sauce on the side, I took a bite of one of the tacos. My mouth was immediately on fire and it was evident that not only chipotle sauce was in the tacos, onions were also present. Alfredo came by again. Asked him to please take the steak tacos back as at this point they were inedible. We waited another 20 minutes. At this point I was no longer hungry. Alfredo surfaced again w the steak tacos & at this point I told him my entire party had finished eating long ago, and I no longer wanted to eat (especially because in my mind this food was now made in bad faith). The manager visited our table one last time & did make good by comping the entire bill for this catastrophically bad experience. He simply stated ""i have no excuses for how bad this went tonight. All I can say is I hope you will give us another chance to make it right on another occasion."" We looked for Alfredo and tipped him nevertheless as we recognized it wasn't all his fault. This visit was an embarrassment for the Cheesecake Factory. Needless to say we will not be returning any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=20
Peter S.,"Bronx, NY",2,25,11,1.0,12/19/2016,"I am extremely disappointed at this location. My husband and I went in for Lunch. After waiting 20minutes, we were seated at a table with the vent right over ours head.  The temperature outside was at freezing 32*. For whatever reason this place had a heavy draft coming out of that vent over our head. My husband requested to the same person who seated us.. male in his 20's, thin with glasses, to move us over one table that had no direct vent. He shrugged him off and said we have another party coming. He offered zero alternative seating options, nor did he give a damn. So what is there to do? Stay and be uncomfortable, or leave? Yeah, we left. I will NEVER EVER patronize this CCF. VERY, VERY poor interpersonal skills and obviously customer service. That guy needs retraining asap.

No price reduction either. When u have a toddler you try to not waste too much time in public places.

Dani S.,"Paramus, NJ",144,159,325,3.0,2/4/2016,"It's an option to come to if you are at Palisades but even then not the best one. The Cheesecake Factory is exactly that - a food factory. While they are known for their huge menu - nothing on that menu ever leaves a lasting impression. Don't get me wrong - the food is not bad and you can find something on the menu no matter what you are in the mode for BUT it's just nothing special. Last time I went was on a Saturday night pre going bowling at the mall with friends. We picked Cheesecake Factory mainly because we were all in the mood to eat different things that night. The service is SLOW!! They could make so much more money (especially on drinks haha) if they just stepped it up a little and checked back more regularly on the tables.  They start you off with a basket of bread - which actually is warm and fresh and yummy. We ordered two salads and a rice dish. No one had any complaints about their food but I can only speak for my own.  I ordered the Seared Tuna Salad - The tuna was deep red and fresh BUT a little ""veiny"" - so not the best cuts of fish. The dressing was good but nothing too special. Overall it leaves you wanting more. They just throw the Tuna on a plate with salad leaves and a side of dressing. Nothing else really. I would like to maybe see some other ""greens"" within the salad.  Go here if you can't decide what you want to eat and are with a group of people. It is solid but nothing that will leave you wanting more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=40

Friendly service. Complimentary bread that's warm and tastes good. The green tea, while a little overpriced, is delicious and free refills is always a plus.

Even worse, our waiter was everywhere except our area! He said the bare minimum, and often just left dishes on the table without saying a word.  The dishes were mediocre, to say the least. There were barely any chicken in the pasta, and if any, they were burnt and crumbly. (Everything chicken shouldn't be.) The avocado eggrolls were whatever- they fell apart easily and weren't even crispy.

Side note: this has nothing to do with the review, just saying, if you have children and you know they don't behave well in restaurants, please don't bring them until their behavior improves. The woman sitting at the next table had three children with her who would not sit still.

Kristen B.,"Middletown, NY",0,27,,3.0,5/7/2017,"I enjoy this chain a great deal, I find the food to be consistently excellent. We arrived at 2pm on a Sunday, and we knew it would be a little busy. We were not expecting to be told 20-25 minutes wait, but hey, it happens. After about 25 minutes, our buzzer went off and we, along with two other parties, went up to hand our buzzers in. Instead of being met by a host or hostess to be seated, we were told to stand in a line barely 20 feet from where we'd already been waiting - and we waited another 10-15 minutes there. So that's a strange seating system they've got going there, and I got the impression they were either running behind or straight up unorganized. We were annoyed, but not swayed. We were finally seated and our waitress was very good. She was attentive, and our drinks and appetizer came out VERY quickly, which was great. We went with fried Mac and cheese balls as an app, and they were DELISH and a nice sized portion for two people. We ordered our meals pretty quickly and those took longer to come out. Probably bordering on too long, but the appetizer was at least a little filling and our waitress kept our drinks full, so I didn't complain. I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans - absolutely delicious, but there was a large pool of grease at the bottom of my plate which was kind of gross. I otherwise enjoyed it, very tasty! My husband ordered the chicken bellagio and he raved about it; he said the chicken was cooked perfectly and was juicy. We took our leftovers and a slice of the vanilla bean cheesecake home with us. While the wait and seating system were an annoyance, the food redeemed it for us. My only true complaint is the weird vent in the ceiling over just the inside row of booths - why does that have to blow such COLD air? It isn't summer yet, and our food got cold VERY fast, and we were almost uncomfortably chilly. We aren't ones to complain about that kind of thing, but it admittedly detracts from the experience, especially when the food is the redeeming factor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=60

Paul L.,"Nanuet, NY",0,5,,1.0,8/23/2017,"Let me preface this review by saying if it was possible to give zero stars we would.  My wife and I brought our daughter to the Cheesecake factory for a birthday dinner.  The table next to us was full of older children who were not under adequate adult supervision. The children were throwing silverware and jumping all around the table pushing one another, creating an unsafe environment for our toddler daughter who was in a high chair in close proximity.  We requested numerous times for management (a rude man named Tony) to address the situation. We were told by our waiter that the manager was ""busy"".  Our daughter was then knocked into our table violently by the child at the next table who jumped off the booth into her high chair. This was the child we repeatedly requested the manager address and speak to his parents regarding his dangerous behavior.  We then began a verbal exchange with the table next to ours and we were told by management we needed to leave.  We requested medical attention for our daughter numerous times, but management insisted we leave the restaurant. Upon us summoning EMS and having paramedics evaluate our daughter, we were asked by management to leave the building and meet the paramedics outside to not cause a scene.  We agree with other poor reviews that service at this location is beyond poor.  This location is not safe for children. We strongly suggest if you value the safety of your children, to consider a different place to dine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=60

Brian S.,"Monroe, NY",60,26,1,1.0,2/18/2017,"I've eaten here several times in the past years and had average consistent food with pretty good service. Last time was a different story. Me and my girlfriend walked in and luckily there wasn't a wait time, so they brought us to a section of the restaurant I didn't know existed wayyyy in the back. They intended on seating us on the last two top table snugged next to the busboy/waiter station. Also the table next to that was two parents and two kids who had seemingly given up on controlling there kids. The hostess still didn't bat an eye and wanted us to sit there..so I obviously had to say ""really, there are booths open right there not crammed against a wall?"". So the hostess said "" I have to go ask if I can move your table"". At this point I knew we were in for something interesting. After awkwardly standing next to the screaming kids and crammed table waiting for the hostess for LITERALLY 10 minutes I decided to sit down in the open booth. (Mind you all the other booths only had two people as well). The hostess finally returned after we sat ourselves and said ""you guys can sit here."". I thought that was funny that she needed to say that and couldn't apologize for taking 10 minutes to ask a question. So our waitress comes a few minutes later, she was ok, clearly stressed because she had to work the worst part of the restaurant. So after putting drink orders in we got them about 15 minutes later which was somewhat at the fault of the design and how far away from the bar we were. We then decided to order our appetizers and entrees to avoid a long wait. So as 20 minutes went by I started to wonder where our nachos were (a simple appetizer). Soon after that I see food coming but it looked like our entrees... the abrupt food runner put or food in front of us and I told him that we didn't even receive our appetizer yet. He said oh well do you want me to bring it out and I'll bring the food out after your done with the nachos. I knew that meant we will put your food under the hot lamp until your done and the we will bring out the same , now not fresh food. So I told him I'd rather you take just forget the nachos and we'll just eat our meals. (This all happened while the waitress was next to the table listening). Our meals were average as usual but tasty nonetheless. When we finally received our bill by another waitress the nachos were still on there of course so I had to wait for it to be removed from the bill.

When we did finally sit down, service was pretty good. Our waiter was very pleasant, informative and attentive. I ordered the club sandwich, and I will never order it again. It was so bland and boring. No flavor. The nachos we ordered for an appetizer were really good. For dessert, which was impossible to choose since the list goes on forever, I chose the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. That was pretty darn good, and def the highlight of the evening.

When I came this time I was in the mood for the fettuccine and was surprised that it was no longer on the menu. That honestly my fav dish and now it was gone.  After flipping the menu back and forth I ordered the carbonara pasta with chicken. I definitely was not impressed. I probably won't order that again. The pasta was way too greasy and the pasta only had like 3 pcs of chicken. Wth is that. I will most likely stick to the Renee special or stop coming, I haven't decided yet.  For dessert I ordered the pecan pumpkin cheesecake. The slice was literally a pecan pie with a thin layer of pumpkin cheesecake.

It was a busy Saturday so this was not too surprising. The chicken dish was a little burnt, but still acceptable. One dessert ordered was the Strawberry shortcake. The strawberries tasted old and the shortcake looked like a muffin cut into four pieces that had a cookie like constancy. The bottom part was burnt black. It was as if they couldn't sell it so let's hide it in the the dessert. It was completely inedible. The waitress saw that it was almost completely left over and asked how it was. I told her it was horrible pointing to the stale tasting burnt parts. She said that she was sorry but never offered to take it off the bill or to give us another . This was the first time I ever complained to the staff about an item. In my mind this was terribly disappointing customer service. Penny wise but pound foolish.

I got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which was very tasty and pretty to look at with great color. All of the flavors really worked very well together and the fresh Arugula made this pasta and battered shrimp dish taste light and fresh. Also the portion size was big which outweighed the price of this delicious dish! My mother got the Pit Beef Dip which was a hot sandwich. The char roasted beef on this sandwich was very juicy and flavorful. All of the flavors really complimented each other & the horseradish sauce just made this dish taste excellent and pulled all of the wonderful flavors together. The presentation, however, was lacking a bit. I would absolutely recommend either of these dishes to anyone looking for some delicious food. The atmosphere & style of this restaurant is great & feels sophisticated (which I like). The reason I gave the Cheesecake Factory 4 stars instead of 5 is because the staff could have been friendlier & quicker to check on us. Also, the presentation on the sandwich could have been better.

Jeff W.,"Hillsdale, NJ",92,434,33,4.0,1/11/2015,"I've been here a few times and it's difficult to pen a review on this place. I guess I need to break it up a few different ways. Probably start with the easiest part first, but like most of my reviews, they become tangent and disjointed! Doing a cheesecake order to go has never been a problem. I go in, pick a few pieces out, order's done, transaction finished...off to the next part of the day. I've never had a server at that counter that was bad.  Dining in however is another story. I recall one time when we were seated all the way in the back and that wasn't too bad. The food was good, no service delays, but you do kind of get forgotten about back there. Not necessarily a bad thing since it gives you time to digest and space everything out.  The portions are huge and I can't seem to not leave that place without a bag in tow. I can't say I've ever had a bad dish there. I do remember having the meatloaf one day and recalling a voice in my head going ""your eyes are bigger than your stomach""...it was right. After that day I changed things up and got some chicken dish with pasta and pesto.  I do remember one time I was there sitting next to ill behaved children and even more ill behaved caretakers of said child. That kind of ruined the experience but that's not the staff's fault.

So we was starving, waiting and looking for our waitress the whole night with an empty table.  Moreover, she took my order wrong, I asked her if she can take out one ingredient from my pasta, she told me she isn't sure, it will be a surprise.(how can she not know?) When I got my pasta right after we got bread, I was really surprised that she took out All the ingredients. My pasta has only veggies and noodles left. I felt it's like a joke. At this point the waitress was gone taking her break, a nice waiter helped to fix it and have it cooked again, when it came back to my table, my pasta was limp.

No ""hi how are you guys today"" ""thanks for coming to the cheesecake factory"".. NOTHING! So the second time she came to the table I had to ask her, ""what is your name"", in which she replied Frankie. Personally, I do not think she is very good at her job, as the first impression was horrible, and secondly because she does not know the menu at all, and thirdly you are constantly looking for her because she never comes back to the table to see if you need anything else. We asked for lemon, and got one slice, very generous! Oh and 4 little slices of bread for two people! You can tell the other slices of bread were ripped off!! The portions were very small, but the prices were still high!  I do feel this restaurant is over priced!

CD R.,"New City, NY",1,11,,1.0,12/30/2015,"This West Nyack location used to be my go-to place when at the Palisades Mall. I can now say that I will not be going to this restaurant anytime soon. For a year or two I have seen a decline in the food quality, the wait staff, the cleanliness, etc. But, the last time I was there, the experience was the worst of all.  Cleanliness: We were shown to our table which was set up but had crumbs all over it, food remnants under the table (pieces of broccoli, French fries, and who knows what else) and dirty silverware. We had to get the waitress to have the table cleaned, swept and all place settings replaced. In addition, While sitting during our meal we had to keep swatting away fruit flies. And the ladies bathroom was absolutely gross- toilet paper all over, wet floors in the stalls, etc.  Food Quality: I tried to order a salad (I think it was a Mediterranean salad) and was told they ran out of it. It was fairly early in the evening, so I thought that was very odd- perhaps they just don't stock the ingredients because it was not one of their larger salads.  We were served bread while waiting for our food and although the bread was fine, the butter patties were totally melted and the butter tasted like it was spoiled. The soda was served and was flat, our food orders all came out at different times and we found the food very salty- especially the French fries. In addition, for a restaurant that is known for its large portions, the salmon that was served was very small- I would say less than 1/4 of a pound for $19.  For dessert we ordered cheesecake and when it was served to us it had fallen over on the plate and part of it had probably fallen on the floor in transport. No apology by the server or offer to get us a new piece.  The Wait Staff: During our meal we had at least 5 different waitresses/waiters. The first girl who had to re-clean our table, went on break during our time there so another waitress came over to say she was covering. That was the last we saw her and then a waiter came over to address the soda being flat. Then a different waitress served us 2 of our three orders with another waiter serving the final entree. A completely different waitress took our dessert order and served it and gave us the check. Not one of these people came over during our meal to ask how everything was and at the end of the meal no one asked if we wanted coffee or dessert- we had to ask for a menu to order dessert.

But if you're gonna be in the Palisades Mall and want a nice place to lunch, The Cheesecake Factory works just fine. The room has a dark wood, upholstered look, which is soothing and fits the upscaling mood that the mall is undergoing right now.  The bathroom is reasonably clean too but not spotless. Service is very friendly and efficient.  The extensive menu also includes a separate, small gluten-free menu. You have to ask for it; it's not automatically offered. Most of the items show up in various spots on the main menu. I didn't see the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad ($17.95) on the regular menu but found it easily on the gluten-free menu. It was pretty good -- the tuna slices were served sashimi style, just a bit grilled around the outer edges, which were also finished in something that was slightly crunchy/spicy.  My friend ordered from the regular menu and there was more than enough to make a filling meal: A cup of tortilla soup ($2.95) that was actually a bowl of soup, and a big chicken salad ($10.50).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=100

I mean, this is cheesecake that's already prepared so I would think it's not rocket science to send these things out rapid fire. Over 30 minutes. Yes 30 minutes wait for 1 slice of cheesecake from a place that has cheesecake in the name of the restaurant.  The workers here were clearly irritated. Not just one but the entire team. I'm not sure what this was stemming from. Perhaps they weren't used to the dinner rush or they were short staffed. However, with dozens of people waiting for a slice or two of cheesecake it just baffled me. I was frustrated just watching them trying to figure out how to put a piece into a to-go container.

Mike C.,"Valley Cottage, NY",91,12,,3.0,1/28/2017,"Went on a Friday night and got called after 15-20 minutes which was fine. Sat down and the waitress arrived somewhat promptly and asked what we wanted to drink. It took a longer time than I thought to get the drinks but it was a little busy, so I get it. Afterwards she took our orders (table of 2) and everything seemed fine. But we waited and waited for bread to come to the table. When our food was ready, a different waitress brought it to our table, and we didn't see the waitress for over 5 minutes when she asked how our food was. A few minutes later I ran out of soda and wanted another, but the waitress was nowhere to be seen; the table next to us had the same waitress and they asked a different waitress to get her because they needed her too. I sat there for over 10 minutes without a drink. She then proceeded to refill it with the wrong soda, but by the time she brought it back I was nearly done so I didn't even bother bringing it to her attention. I ended up riding dessert to go and had to wait another 10 minutes for a piece of cheesecake and the check. After she dropped of the check she was quick to come back to see when we were done.

Stefan B.,"West Nyack, NY",6,113,1,3.0,4/7/2014,"""Huge"" is a word that I think is very fitting for this place. For starters, it's housed in the huge Palisades Center Mall. As such, the restaurant space itself is huge. Couple that with the fact that the waitstaff may be undermanned and your service could suffer as mine did during lunchtime on a Saturday. Waiting lines can be huge.  The menu is huge, almost to the point that it's overwhelming. There are so many things on the menu that simply deciding what you want can be considered an event in itself. Portions are huge and also pack a punch with calories. The Cheesecake Factory is notorious for being amongst the worst chain restaurants for the health conscious. For this reason they created a ""Skinnylicious"" menu, which is also huge, and if you're looking through that AND their regular menu, you're going to be there a while. My disappointment in their cheesecake was huge. I didn't get anything fancy, just a standard strawberry cheesecake. It wasn't special. For a place named the Cheesecake Factory, I was definitely disappointed. But I was more disappointed for the huge price for one slice of cheesecake ($8.62!!).  Outside of their astronomical cheesecake prices, everything else seemed reasonable. The food was good for a chain restaurant, but let's not confuse this place with Jean Georges. I like it as a nicer lunch option in the mall than say, Chili's, but I'm not sure I'd come here for dinner or go out of my way to eat here if I wasn't already in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=120

Brian T.,"Branford, CT",3,30,3,2.0,1/11/2014,"I've been here for perfectly pleasant lunches once or twice in the past, and as long as you don't expect the food to be particularly creative or fresh, the Cheesecake Factory can certainly be an agreeable place to have a meal. However, let's not forget that it's called the Cheesecake *Factory*. I don't know what parts of the menu are prepared fresh in-house and what's prepared long in advance on a bleak production plant floor in a faraway land, frozen into chunks, and mailed to West Nyack for defrosting, but the ""Factory"" part of the name isn't just a quaint affectation. The kitchen does not have a production line of ten quirky local grandmas preparing the cuisine from scratch and sending it out to the tables with love and pride. The name really should be your first clue that certain rules of logic and reasonable behavior may be suspended when you walk through the door. When you have a giant chain pretending to be a bistro, occasionally the cheery façade will peel back, and the dystopian nightmare beneath will reveal itself. We came in for dinner on a Friday night, and it was a 30-minute wait for a table. That's not my problem at all, since they told us it would be that long and gave us a pager. We even got a drink at the bar while we waited. The insane parade of incompetence only began when we actually got our table and sat without any contact from the Cheesecake Mill staff for about fifteen minutes. During that time, we saw an animated argument going on at the other end of the restaurant between a woman who would eventually become our first of three waiters and a man who later turned out to be both our second waiter and the manager. Eventually, waiter #1 finished her argument, came over, and immediately began acting bizarre and standoffish, as if making eye contact us with was a problem and her top priority was to get away from us as quickly as possible. She was remarkably more chipper when she checked in on the tables near us, so we think it had something to do with our table in particular. I really don't think it could have been anything we said or did, since we were friendly, despite the delays, and since her attitude was already going in full force before either of us said a word. I am relatively certain that our party did not smell of dead cats, though that would also have explained her behavior.  Another explanation that would fit all the facts is that she assumed--accurately--that we were a couple and had a problem with that because we're both men. However, I don't think we did anything that would distinguish us from two friends having dinner and drinks, so that theory may not explain the facts as well as rank incompetence does. Regardless of the reasons for her behavior, after that first weird encounter, #1 disappeared for about fifteen more minutes before coming back with menus and water. She also took our drink order before leaving the table. Then, she apparently fell down a well somewhere in the New Jersey countryside, because we didn't see her again for quite some time. As the search parties continued their tireless efforts to find #1, #2 came over about fifteen minutes later and re-took our drink order, introducing himself as the manager, apologizing for the delay, and explaining that he'd be our waiter from now. Everything was going to be fine. We smiled. We were genuinely nice about the delay. Who cares? It's only been a half hour. The manager has taken a personal interest. They'll take great care of us from here on out. Fifteen minutes later, in a neat plot twist, a third individual came over and explained that he was actually our waiter. He took our drink order, of course! His attitude was courteous and professional. Everything was going to be fine. We never saw him again.  If you're keeping score at home, that's two menus, two glasses of water, three waiters, one manager, three drink orders, forty-five minutes, and no food.  Another fifteen minutes or so later, #1 was extracted from the well, cleaned up, and returned to us with a round of drinks. Her bizarre attitude was, if anything, worse from here on out. It was perhaps the most awkward service I have ever received in a restaurant. Things then alternated between uncomfortable and tiresome right up until we finally stepped out of the Cheesecake Ironworks over two hours after we were seated. In that time, we got one round of drinks and one course of mediocre food. Waiting twenty minutes for the check was a nice touch at the end. Cheesecake Sweatshop of the Palisades Mall, you get two stars because I've had a lunch there at least once that wasn't devised in the mind of an evil genius to torture the innocent. But this dinner was not only terrible; it will forever serve as a reminder of why it's usually better not to try to have a nice evening out at a corporate chain with ""Factory"" right in the name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=120

Dinah B.,"Manhattan, NY",907,144,152,3.0,12/22/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is just somewhere you go when you're already in the Palisades mall. I would never come here just for the food.  The food is ok. I mean most chain restaurants aren't meant to provide culinary adventures (except for Morton's or Houston's) and most picky eaters can at least find something to their liking (I mean their menu is basically an entire book. If you can't find something here then I'm glad I don't know you).  Their salads are a safe bet, but most of the other meals are either deep fried or swimming in oil. I'll admit that I used to enjoy the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, but after reheating my left overs and seeing all of that extra oil, I was just grossed out. I usually go for the Cobb Salad or the Santa Fe, while the BFF goes for the Chinese Chicken Salad. If you order the Caesar salad, just know that it comes with lots of chopped anchovies (not my thing, since the flavor was overpowering and my breath reeked for about two days).

It's too small. 80% of the tables are on top of one another and personally, I don't like being SO close to the tables around us that it's like  eating with another 4 people. On top of that, the chairs are just so damned uncomfortable. We immediately requested to be put in a booth for a. a little more privacy and b. more comfort.  So we moved to a booth nearby. I watched them clean it, however, it was still filthy and sticky and my spoon had a giant piece of pasta stuck to it. Ew! I just wanna say that the menu is WAY too big and WAY too all over the place. We ordered the Buffalo Blast appetizer which was GIGANTIC but eh. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Madeira which was wonderful and I ordered the burrito which was also way too big. I asked for a box the second she served it, already knowing I couldn't finish it, especially since I knew I wanted a piece of cheesecake.  BF ordered the Oreo Dream cheesecake. He seemed to really like it. I thought it was ok. I ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake and it was DIVINE.

I was like I ate this 5000 time before and you acted like idk that your oven have a timer!!! Apology with a lied. I don't appreciate!  And time before this they burn down my dynamic shrimp appetizer too and the Waites lied said that how the dynamic shrimp look liked ( it's funny how they don't know I used to go there almost 2 twice a week ) and the sauté chicken that I couldn't finish and told them I didn't want it end up I got food poison.  I send the food back because the chicken wasn't fully cook and still have pink inside. After 4 bites I paid for the price when I came home later that night!  This place went down hill they will need a new kitchen manager and some honestly people to work in there.  Not just try to save there own ass and lies.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=200

I contacted corporate and there so arrogant and full of themselves they sent me a 20$ gift certificate on a 70$ bill and said they shouldn't even be sending that. Yeah seriously .

We waited half an hour for a table, I was surprised at how busy this place is given the number of tables this place can hold. I guess everyone wants a fix of some cheesecake! Our waiter, Jonathan, was entertaining and attentive and was the highlight of our dining experience. My friends and I all ordered salads, I ordered the Waldroff Salad from the new tasting menu and it was delicious and just the right portion (smaller than the regular size salads). We also ordered 2 small appetizer plates, the zucchini fries were godly, i would definitely order them again. When time came for dessert, Jonathan our waiter explained what cheesecakes were available and what were his favorites. I ordered his recommendation, the new S'more cheesecake and it was delicious!

Run with military precision and phenomenally clean - apparently they go through $50,000 worth of detergents in a year - the servers here have a robotic, ultra-rehearsed vibe to them, and one can only picture the kitchen: the menu here is a 20-page monster. Devoid of natural light, you'll be desperate for a candle if you're sat anywhere over by the bar, but that's a minor niggle. The food is overpriced and colossally unhealthy, but above par. I've had some excellent jambalaya here, as well as monstrous sandwiches and chip/dip combos. Really good drinks selection too, and a full-on bar. And yes, the cheesecake is superb. Expensive ($6.95 per slice) but superb. I don't doubt that they're all delicious, but I can only personally vouch for the Banana Cream or Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.

The beef itself was not that tasty either. I have had much better Kobe beef than this. They used a fancy pungent mushroom on this burger which overpowered the taste of the meat and made me a bit nauseous as well.

We have had great  dining experiences at the cheesecake factory and  we. Thought it would be an appropriate venue.  We chose a central location from everyone which turned out to be the restaurant in west nyack at the palisades mall. The 1hr and 15 min wait was not so much an issue since it was indeed Friday and we were a relatively large group (12 altogether). After we finally got our seats we made our orders for drinks and appetizers, this went relatively smoothly.  Then came the entrees, everyone made their order with salmon being the majority of orders made. Within about 15 mins the waiter came back and said there was no more salmon.  The manager even came over to give an explanation for the shortage, which was understandable.  My concern is why isn't there some sort of compensatory policy in place when individuals are forced to eat something they did not desire.  Everyone told me instead of complaing we should have just left but I feel compelled to let the corporate individuals know that there is a need for some sort of appeasement to customers especially if they are giving such a considerable contribution to the business. Now I understand the manager doesn't really how we feel since they are always packed and make decent profits, but when customers are not completely satisfied they have failed as a food service provider.  We spent $458 and I know t isn't an exorbant amount f money it s still substantial and some appreciation should be shown.

Bryan B.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",18,68,17,4.0,1/15/2012,It was my first time here.  At this site the wait was about an hour.  But it was well worth it.  Try the Buffalo Blast.  The Kuala CO-CO Cheesecake was amazing!.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Fred J.,"Stony Point, NY",1,18,,2.0,8/8/2014,"I'll start off by saying I've been going to this restaurant since it opened and I always like it.  Went there recently and I gotta say that the place has really gone down hill. It was a hot summer night so a nice air conditioned restaurant was what we were looking for, but this place was warm and stuffy.  It also wreaked of stale food.  We were somewhat acknowledged by a server at the front desk but he kind of ran away.  A host then came by and sat us.  We were brought to a table that was wiped down just in the center. (I know this because it was still wet). There were crumbs on the rest of the table.  Dirty silverware, sticky seats, a fly buzzing around, the place was filthy.  My wife drinks wine and always enjoyed their selection.  We'll that's gone, the entire wine list was cut in half.  I ordered a beer and it came in a warm pint glass. Food was okay.  I had some sort of shrimp and chicken with curry and rice.  (Bang bang chicken?). The rice was below room temp and there was a film on the curry sauce like it was baking underneath a heat lamp.  I'm guessing they added cold rice right before it went out. Wife had salmon that was bland.  We decide on cheesecake, so we ordered the key lime to go.  We get home and the thing is a mess.  And I'm not sure it was cheesecake, I think it was just key lime pie.  The bathrooms were disgusting too.  The fact that the place was so dirty was alarming.  I'm guessing they are feeling the effects of The Yard House being upstairs and have cut labor to deal with the lost of sales.  I'll stay away from that mall all together.  BTW the servers that took care of us were great, so you can always be assured you get good service there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Michael R.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,,4.0,3/11/2014,"The food is good and reasonably priced. They don't take reservations, so the wait can be long. Their bread is excellent. The Thai lettuce wraps are great. Their chicken salad sandwich is very good too. Of course, their cheesecake is to die for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Audrey D.,"Yonkers, NY",4,45,2,4.0,12/17/2010,"I would go more often it were closer to me.  The food is great and the place is impeccable.  The prices are very reasonable, I guess a few reviewers have never dined downtown Manhattan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Jenna A.,"Westchester, NY",2,59,,4.0,6/29/2010,"Almost received the full five - but we waited awhile for our pager thing to go off, then when it did, they put our party of 4 in another waiting section... I have to wait twice?? Forgot all about this though when it came to the great service we received and delicious food & dessert. DELICIOUS - have to go, even if just for the dessert, and they have plenty to choose from, so go already!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Cliff R.,"Bridgewater Township, NJ",74,34,4,4.0,10/11/2011,"I know, I know - what are you going to get at the Cheesecake Factory.  Well: first the wait staff was amazing.  We changed orders, made substitutions, changed things last minute, got our drinks right away - so for wait staff...two thumbs up.  For food: I really enjoyed what I got.  Hey, it's not gourmet cuisine - it's the cheesecake factory.  However, I really thought what they gave me was tasty and yes, I had the cheesecake and it was excellent.  Overall, a good experience as long as you go in with the right expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Darius K.,"Commack, NY",7,35,,3.0,5/6/2008,"Are you really checking Yelp for Cheesecake Factory reviews?  Well, since you're here, the thing to note about this specific Cheesecake Factory is that there is never a wait for a table for breakfast or their Sunday Brunch. Which means that this fat-ass can enjoy his Monte Cristo's in peace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Johanna N.,"Yonkers, NY",0,10,,2.0,12/23/2013,"Came for my birthday drove 45 minutes. Busy Sunday, bathrooms were gross. No toilet paper or soap! Sat down for dinner ordered appetizers. Half way through eating them, a glass of soda just busted for no reason. Waitress rushed over to help clean up. She stated this sometimes happens from too much ice? We changed tables and they brought out our food. Dinner was great but after all that they had the nerve to charge me for the appetizers which were ripped off the table before we could eat them. I asked to speak to the manager. I at least wanted to get a discount. I didn't feel like it was fair. Well the waiter comes back and says the manager doesn't feel like coming down unless its really necessary. He handed me a revised bill and they removed two appetizers out of the 6 we ordered. I would have thought a manager could have and should have handled this more professional.  I was pretty disappointed. I don't think we will be going there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Chad M.,"Bronx, NY",6,21,1,3.0,3/22/2011,Great place to eat ... good service and flavorsome food. Also being the cheesecake Factory they have over 75 different types of cheesecake ... I have been here and to the one in White plains many times and must say altho it can be a little pricey its worth it ... Love the Shephards Pie ... MMMM YUMMY !!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Joe G.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,9,1,3.0,4/29/2011,"The food was good, but I think I was let down after all the hype about this place. Desert was great, I had Godiva brownie sundae, but that credit goes more towards Godiva than the cheesecake factory. the service at this place though wasn't good at all, so that put a damper on things too. Not a place I'd go out of my way to get to, but if I'm in the area I'd go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Matthew H.,"Menlo Park, CA",77,442,84,4.0,9/20/2010,"This was my first time back to Cheesecake in 8+ years, it was a long wait and a happy return. We skipped appetizers and munched on the fresh bread & butter while we waited for our food. I had the Chicken Bellagio (sans basil) and my dining companion had the restaurant favorite Chicken Madeira (w/ mashed potatoes). Both dishes were large portions (enough for maybe 2 meals, in fact we had the remainders for lunch the next day). Naturally we were saving room for the cheesecake. We were too full to finish them but we ordered the Caramel pecan turtle & Wild blueberry cheesecake. Both delicious. Our waitress was fast (several water refills) and friendly (service with a smile). This restaurant represented the chain well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
Bobbie D.,"Clifton, NJ",1,6,,1.0,11/20/2013,This place is the dirtiest restaurant around. You can see the streaks of dirt on the wood walls.  It's like they used a dirty kitchen rag to clean the place down.   100's of flying bugs all over the kitchen area.  My waitress was embarrassed when she watched me drown fruits flies in my soup and squished them in my fries.  I tried to address this with management and he denied any bug problem and blew me off like I was disturbing him.  Management should be fired for having a dirty restaurant and for treating customers like trash.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-nyack?start=220
