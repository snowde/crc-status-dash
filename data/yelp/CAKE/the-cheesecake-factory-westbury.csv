Betsy J.,"Hicksville, NY",36,62,90,4.0,11/4/2017,"Cheesecake factory has something for everyone.  Very varied menu with a ""skinnylicious "" section.  I ordered the shrimp tacos off the skinnylicious menu. You get three shrimp tacos but they were not flavorful.   I  have had the grilled salmon previously and that was very good.    However, my husband ordered the shepards pie and it was delicious.  My daughter also loved the buffalo blasts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20
Cecilia T.,"Long Island, NY",488,335,1410,3.0,1/9/2017,"This place is the only chain restaurant I would consider going to even though I dislike chains and since we had a gift card to here, why not? We came on a Saturday night for dinner and surprisingly, there was no wait and plenty of seating available due to the snowstorm because usually this location is super busy packed. There's also a large well-lit parking lot, which is shared with The Mall at The Source.  The service was good and food was decent so what more can you ask for? Not to mention, the huge portions (and the calories). We got the chicken pot stickers app to share and I got the luau salad, which is 1250 cal while my husband got the California cheesesteak, all which equals to a 3250 cal meal for 2. It's ashamed we didn't have room for dessert because their strawberry cheesecake is delish!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20
Rashid M.,"New York, NY",1098,933,574,3.0,2/8/2017,"So I've been back here now probably a dozen time, so I guess it's time that I update my review... Now that I've tried a few entrees from their menu, I feel like the food is better than when I first started coming here. I've tried the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and think it's a very good dish. I also tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and liked it a lot. I'm still sticking to my usual cheesecake here, which is the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. One of my favorite cheesecakes ever! Some things still haven't changed though. The wait to get a table here is ridiculous. Last time, we waited over 1.5 hours on a weekday. For some crazy reason, the restaurant closed the huge seating area on the 1st floor. It doesn't make sense at all! Be ready to wait a LONG time if you want to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20
Buddy B.,"Shreve, OH",0,31,33,3.0,11/10/2017,"Not a bad place to eat, I came here for the cheesecake. I had the catfish, it was good. Always expect to spend some cash here. I should have ate my cheesecake first before my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20
Jack K.,"New York, NY",48,311,277,4.0,9/29/2017,"What's not to like when you eat at The Cheesecake Factory? Endless selections of sweet and savory, salty and greasy, healthy and light... there is something for everyone... all day, everyday! I can come back here over, and over, and over... and still can't get enough of their Fried Calamari... fried light and crisp, served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce... it has to be the best and crispiest calamari on east coast. Hibachi Steak served with Shiitake Mushrooms, Onions, Bean Sprouts and Tempura Asparagus is good, but need more Wasabi because it can get too sweet without it. Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp is packed with serious heat and balanced well with plantains and marinated pineapple. There are so many things to try here, it'll take forever to go through everything on the menu... which is why, it never gets old to eat The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20

Meri L.,"Plainview, NY",444,264,1257,3.0,11/16/2016,"Went on a Wednesday night around 515pm. There was no wait and my party of 2 was seated right away. Our waiter took quite a while to come to our table and introduce himself, and ask us what we wanted to drink. It took a while to get the famous bread basket also. Boo!  We finally put in our drink orders and our food orders. Drinks and food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the lettuce wraps appetizer as my entree and my friend ordered the chicken slider appetizer as his entree. Sorry, no pictures for either entree because we were both very hungry! No complaints on either dish. Both were very delicious and very satisfying. I highly recommend the lettuce wraps to everyone! Nomnomnom We both ordered cheesecake for dessert. It's The Cheesecake Factory! You must get Cheesecake! With so many varieties to choose from, there is something for everyone. I ordered the low carb Cheesecake with strawberries, and my friend ordered the salted caramel cheesecake. Both were absolutely delicious!  Someone other than our waiter brought out our food, and someone other than our waiter brought out or dessert. Another sever brought us a box for our leftover cheesecake. Our waiter never came by even once to make sure everything was okay. Our waiter only brought out our alcoholic beverages. By the end of the night 4 different people waited on/served us. When it was time for us to pay, our waiter was no where to be found to get the bill.  Service tonight was not good at all. It wasn't overly busy. There's no excuse for poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20

Jay Infamous L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",150,493,35,2.0,10/29/2017,"Went here last week with the family and was very disappointed with a lot here.  First and foremost the accuracy to how long me and my family were waited to be seated was way off. We were first told that we would be seated upstairs in 5 minutes. 5 minutes turned into 10, 10 minutes turned into 25. Very poorly estimated time of seating.  Secondly, the lighting or lack there of in this restaurant is horrendous. Way too dim and once it got more into the evening around 7:30pm the lights dimmed even more which made it more difficult to read off the menu and not comfortable for family dining. Thirdly...the food for the most part was not good at all. I ordered a burger and fries. The burger was less than subpar. Dry, lacked seasoning, bun was very bland. Fries lacked flavor as well. I stopped eating halfway through. Only thing remotely good was the buffalo wings that we had for appetizers.  Added to that, we received the bread at our table wayyyy after we initially sat down. As a matter of fact we didn't get our bread till after the appetizers. I don't know of any other restaurant that does this because most if not all sit in restaurants that I go to give you bread a minute or two after seating.  The only thing deserving of appreciation is the cheesecake which I am almost surprised they did not get wrong here, although the waiter had to ask my mother more than twice which cheesecake she ordered. Very poor listening. To go on though I had the birthday celebration cheesecake which was very good....well the ONLY thing really good about my experience here. They only get 2 stars for that which really should be a star and a half.  Sorry but not sorry, never returning to this Cheesecake Factory location. Please do better",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20
Chris L.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,15,,3.0,1/10/2018,"I've been going to this restaurant for over 10 years and this place has changed quite a bit. Back in 2009 and 2010, this place was always packed, you couldn't even get in a Saturday night without a 2 and  a half hour wait. The food was pretty damn good and the service always went accordingly. Well fast forward to my last visit in late December of 2017, and this visit paints a different tale. I went with a couple of friends mine. Once again it was a Saturday night, pretty packed and the wait was only just 45 minutes. Just like a pretty packed place the ambiance was rather loud. We could hardly hear our selves as we conversing along about the past events of the day. We started off with a few appetizers, Buffalo wings and spinach dip. Although the wings were cooked, it didn't have the spice and the kick that it once had, and the blue cheese dressing for the wings tasted watered down and less like blue cheese. The spinach dip was okay, it just wasn't good, the recipe called for a different cheese that mellowed out the taste, not very pleasant. However on a few high notes my bacon-bacon cheese burger with sweet potato fries was cooked perfectly. My coffee and cream chocolate cheesecake also ended the night on a good one. It's tart and bitterness of the coffee complimented the rich sweet creamy mascarpone mouse. It was savory, sweet and delightful. As far as the service was concerned, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. Our waitress was really concerned with our dinning experience. Our drink took around 20 minutes to get. All in all as some of the food was only okay, but the rest was worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20
Jessica F.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",1,44,68,1.0,11/29/2017,"Poor service. Very slow. They have us waiting for over half an hour when there were tables available. The service is not good. I would go to another location. We also order cheesecake before getting seated. It took them over 15 minutes just getting the cheesecake in the box. We didn't get it until we asked for it. Very disappointed. Drove over 40 minutes for this kind of service. The wait time for the food is not worth it. Price wise, is average. I would rather eat somewhere else with better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20
kristine m.,"Manhasset, NY",131,49,383,3.0,10/2/2017,"If I could I would actually rate the cheesecake factory at 3.75. I really do love this place and I come here often, the menu has such amazing variety but it's actually a little too overwhelming. I usually stick to my regular dishes which are the wings, dry with sauce on the side, the wings are really amazing here. The quinoa and kale salad is light and always fresh sometimes they are a little heavy with the dressing so I like to order the dressing on the side. I've tried the eggroll sampler and it's definitely an indulgent appetizer, a bit too greasy for me but very tasty. The main dishes that I always order are the white chicken chili with brown rice. It is very tasty and one of the dishes with a lower calorie count, and for those of you who have a carb phobia it is basically just a heaping tablespoon of rice surrounded by delicious chili. The factory burrito grande is insane and truly grande if you love Mexican food as well as their factory heuvos rancheros! I also enjoy the crusted chicken romano, The chicken is nice and thin, lightly fried and delicious. The chicken and biscuits and the famous factory meatloaf are delicious was generous portions, you can actually buy one dish and bring it home to feed three kids! I have to also mention the Louisiana chicken pasta. It has a nice southern kick and the bowtie pasta is yummy. In terms of desserts, I highly recommend the carrot cake. I don't even like carrot cake but the Cheesecake Factory Carrot cake made a believer because it is truly insane and I always order it over any cheesecake. If you are in a chocolate cake mood Linda's fudge cake is the best! My top picks of cheesecakes are tiramisu, snickers bar chunks and cheesecake, Adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple cake cheesecake and Reese's pieces peanut butter cup cake cheesecake. I have tried the low-carb cheesecake as a healthy alternative and it yummy with a side of whip cream and fresh strawberry. The restaurant is quite large, crowded, noisy, bright, people come here to celebrate occasions like graduation, hint hint - do not go during graduation time because there will be a long wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20
Eleni K.,"Manhasset, NY",19,119,395,5.0,12/10/2017,The food is always really good here! I love the burgers. They are perfectly cooked and really tasty. I also love a bunch of their appetizers such as the crab dip or the Tex mex spring rolls. I also really enjoy their lemonades. They only one I was not crazy about was the raspberry. The only down side to this restaurant is that all the dishes they serve are about 900 or more calories.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20
Sherene M.,"Queens, NY",131,105,175,5.0,5/5/2017,"I don't really love chain restaurants but I will make an exception here. The design is awesome. High ceilings lots of booth seating, it feels kind of royal. Nothing like a red lobster or outback.  There's almost always a wait. I don't believe they take reservations but if you call when you're about 15 away you can add your name to the list.  Service is pretty good and they seem to care about your experience. If you don't like anything they always send the manager over to get feedback and offer a solution. I've been eating the same dish here for over ten years and one night the sauce tasted odd and when I brought it to the attention of the manager he agreed and stopped serving it for the evening.  Prices are about average and portions are pretty large.  I love the brown bread they serve.  Drinks I love-frozen iced mango, passionfruit mojito, Georgia peach. They aren't very strong so don't expect to get tipsy.  Appetizers- buffalo blast is amazing. Like a shredded Buffalo wing deep fried and served with homemade blue cheese dressing.  Avocado rolls--think avocado egg roll with tamarind dipping sauce  Popcorn shrimp--love the dipping sauce  Entree- my go to dish is Jamaican black pepper shrimp. With mashed potatoes. Served with plantains are always fried to perfection and mango salsa  Meatloaf, BBQ chicken salad  Dessert- this one is hard. Everything is great.  Vanilla bean cheesecake, Godiva, red velvet, caramel turtle, carrot, I love them all.  I came once for brunch and don't recall what I had but it was amazing and I need to go again to refresh my memory.  This place can do no wrong in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=20

Taheefa S.,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",61,121,171,5.0,4/7/2017,"Definitely somewhere, I would go to frequently if I lived in the area. Its surrounded by a mall so the parking is a PLUS! It is always crowded especially on the weekends so be ready! They have a brunch menu as well, many people aren't aware of that.  Now to the real meat & potatoes, THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE! The food, the service, the ambiance and atmosphere is all so upscale, not that you need to be dressed up to dine her but the feel of the restaurant makes you feel special. It can get busy but the servers are usually always attentive to you and your needs, out of the multiple times I've been to this location I've never experienced any problems. Their go to dish is the Chicken Madiera and after you have it you will know why it's their most recommended dish.

Kristy T.,"Queens, NY",36,124,35,1.0,12/6/2017,"So disappointing! We've come to cheesecake numerous times and were always happy with the food and service. However, today's service was absolutely terrible. It took 1/2 and hour for our food to come out and when it did, half of what we ordered came out cold and greasy. Our waitress, CoryAnn, said that she would get us the manager when we decided to return the truffle & bacon cheese sticks, but the manager never came around. I'm pretty sure she didn't even tel him.

My go to is the fried chicken sandwich. It's HUGE and godly. The tuxedo cheesecake is my favorite but any cake is a good cake. Try the Mac and cheese balls! The drinks are really good.

Kirandeep K.,"Flushing, NY",2,41,105,3.0,9/24/2017,"This was my first time at cheesecake factory. Its understandable that there is a long wait time on the weekends as its one of the few places open late on long island. The staff is very nice and accomadating. The complimentary bread wasnt as warm as i wpuld have liked it to be. The food was overall good. The portions are filling so keep that in mind if you arent too hungry. The skinnylicious salad was flavorful and a good crunch in the mouth, but i give the food a 3 because its not something out of this world.

Chris D.,"East Bronx, NY",14,43,73,3.0,6/13/2017,"I am so disappointed! We were at Roosevelt Field Mall and went to the Cheesecake Factory in Garden City specifically for the new coffee & cream cold brew cheesecake, which sounds so delicious and which we believed was being offered nationwide based on advertising seen on Facebook and the Cheesecake Factory website.

After waiting an hour and a half for a table () we got a booth upstairs (1st win) then Bea promptly met us at our table and took our drink and appetizer order.  Unbelievably, our appetizers came out quickly and when promised. She came by 3-4 times to check on us and make sure we were ok, and I know she must've been juggling multiple tables.

The food is always so good and the pumpernickel bread is my favorite....I always request more lol. My friend ordered shrimp Alfredo which he was enjoying until he noticed that several of the pasta was clumped together, so I told him to request another plate because that wasn't cool at all.  The manager came over to ask what was wrong with the dish and was happy to replace it with a new order after my friend showed him what was wrong with it.

Jihye B.,"Levittown, NY",220,115,131,4.0,12/22/2015,"It's a chain, so I feel it is only fair to compare it to the other Cheesecake Factory nearby at Walt Whitman Mall. This restaurant is two floors and there was ample parking, even on a busy Friday night. We went early, so were promptly seated, although when we left at 7:30 that was no longer the case. The one at Walt Whitman is smaller and more crowded, imo.  My table ordered a few appetizers. The spinach dip was good and the Tex-Mex egg rolls were bomb, but the Vietnamese spring roll was hard and underseasoned. It looked like they had pre-made the rolls and left it in the fridge, but you can't do that with rice paper because it gets so dry and hard so quickly.  I had the fish tacos for my entree. The tacos were good but what I was really pleased by were the black beans on the side. The other girls at my table seemed to enjoy their sandwiches, pasta, and salad.  Then, the cheesecake! I love the cheesecakes but they're on the expensive side. I ordered three more slices to take home for other people and it was over 20 dollars. The cheesecake creations are unique, certainly, but I could get a whole pie of cheesecake for that price.  Our servers (another girl had to help our original server for some reason, no biggie) were polite and they bothered to check up on whether everything was okay, etc.. But when I was getting the cheesecakes from the front, one server started to yell and be rude to her fellow waiter. It was uncomfortable.  Overall, it's a chain restaurant and you shouldn't expect bold or concise flavors, but they're consistent and safe enough to cater to a wide audience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=80

It does get a little crazy on the weekends, but I feel the waiting time goes by pretty fast. As for the food, if you have been to one Cheesecake Factory you have been to them all. The food is delicious and consistent to what I would expect.

Christopher S.,"Queens Village, NY",115,61,105,4.0,7/18/2016,"This is our 2nd time going to this Cheesecake Factory. We went on a Friday night and had waited 15 minutes (not bad) and went upstairs. The waiter, Mike, was a cool guy. We gave him our list of drinks and appetizers and he didn't even write it down. We were impressed with his memory since the menu has at least 1,000 items on it. We only wanted to try the appetizers this time. We had ordered the chicken pot stickers, southern fried chicken sliders and eggroll sampler. The southern fried chicken with fries could have been better. They were very salty. Now the chicken pot stickers were very good! One thing though about the eggroll sampler..they give you 4 pairs of different eggrolls. We just didn't care for the avocado in the eggroll. Next time we will focus on the other three..Tex Mex, Crispy Cuban and Firecracker Salmon. The Firecracker Salmon eggroll was the best...hands down!! Now for the drinks. My wife had ordered the Factory Peach Bellini. She took one sip and said it was too fruity. So of course..like a typical wife..she had tasted my drink (Caribbean Cooler) and took my drink yet passed me hers. I only had a sip of that Island type drink! You all need to try the Caribbean Cooler!! We were so stuffed with food that we had to take two cheesecakes home. I am not a cheesecake person but I loved the Hershey's Chocolate Bar cheesecake. The added chocolate chips made it even more decadent. My wife loved the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake.

Never ate anything memorable here like wow I need that again asap. Just blah  Today my father begged me to pick him up some food so I said let me give their ""curbside to go"" a try. I called in my order on the phone and they also had a designated parking spot for that. You give them a call when you get there and someone will come down and bring you your food to your car. If you're paying with a credit card they will take it and go back inside to swipe then return with the receipt. Whatever works-- I ran out the house looking a mess so that was my only option lol. I won't say it's not really convenient so kudos for that.  As for food, I ordered the spicy chicken pasta which wasn't spicy and very tasteless. The pasta was undercooked and the chicken was just huge chunks and under-seasoned. It was greasy and I couldn't even finish it because it was just so bland. I felt like I was eating just to eat and I prefer to enjoy my meals.  This is why I don't like this place. Just like its twin Grand Luxe they don't have any specialities. Nothing memorable--20 menu pages of crap. They need to really cut their menu in half and work on perfecting a few dishes. Sorry but I'm not sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=80
Carrie F.,"Phoenix, AZ",94,109,106,3.0,8/11/2016,"Came here for dinner on a wed night at about 830pm was shocked at how busy they were.  It's a two story restaurant yet they were only serving on the second floor? Wait was 20 min, not bad went quick but just seemed like a cluster of people crammed right in front of the take out area.   Food- the brown bread to start is deadly - very good - try not to get full on it alone.  Avocado rolls was the app we ordered they were tasty but the dipping sauce it came with was the best part.  As for my main dish- the menu is extremely overwhelming , to me when restaurants have so many options they tend to lack on taste with the dishes.  Ordered the Kobe burger - was ok nothing amazing, I tried the other dishes that people had ordered and overall nothing special most lacked flavor.  I can see why I don't come often.  The only good thing about the large menu is we dined with a diverse groups of eaters ( picky, vegan, and vegetarian) and everyone was able to get a dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=80

Serena N.,"Jersey City, NJ",115,528,7142,2.0,2/19/2017,"Stopped by here for lunch and was a little surprised by the lack of service. We went upstairs to be seated at there was no hostess in sight for at least 10 minutes. Once seated, our server took our order but never offered us any bread, we actually had to ask her for it. The table next to use was brought bread right away. We also notice they received a medley of breads and all we got was 1 kind. We ordered the chicken samosas which were oily and over salted. The avocado egg rolls were really good. For lunch we got the pizza and salad special.  The pizza was not good, did not taste fresh at all and was ready made. The salad was a basic Cesar salad. We also ordered the Cobb Salad which was $14.95 for the regular portion, this came with chicken: I asked for a side of grilled salmon in addition to the salad which the menu stated was an extra $5. I expected to pay $19.95 for a chicken and salmon Cobb salad. I clearly told my server I want both. When I received my salad there was no chicken in it, just the salmon. I figured the server didn't hear me and that she substituted the salmon for the chicken. When I received the bill I was charged $18.95 for the salad. For the extra $1 I could have had both the chicken and salmon which is what I wanted. Very poor service, server wasn't not paying attention at all and was in another world. I emailed the business about my experience and spoke to a a manager who just said 'thanks for the feedback.' Ummm what about the fact I didn't get what I ordered and was charged extra for something I didn't didn't receive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=80

The dishes which were Jamaican black pepper shrimp, rib eye steak, chicken pasta just to name a few, the food and appetizer are delicious highly recommend this place if you have not been here yet. The decor is warm and welcoming. Our server was tentative always coming around and the food was fairly quick to come out with all dishes coming out at the same time. The place wouldn't be called cheese cake factory if they did not serve cheese cakes.

Server was even joking about dipping the cheesecake in their enchilada sauce, or putting it on the cheesecake. So disappointed. Service was awesome though I can't complain about the waitress or hostess !! Sad when you pay 20$ a meal and yet places like IHOP are a better option.

I've been going to the Grand Lux Cafe instead. But my husband had a craving for Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake so we decided - why not? Sat Night, 6:30pm - 1 Hr wait for 2. We waited 55 min. Damn! Was hoping it was more like 20. The crazy thing is, there were SO many open tables when we were seated - yet there were sooo many people just waiting still. I hate it when restaurant's do that.  We were dying to get Apps but knew the portions were huge so we skipped in hopes we'd have room for cheesecake at the end of our meals. He ordered the Chicken and Biscuits. Ho in the world it was 2500+ calories... we soon  found out. The gravy was oozing butter. The biscuits, drowned in butter. The chicken and the biscuits together- heavenly! Listen, you just can't possibly go wrong with THAT much butter. I'm guessing 1-2 sticks? It was heavy, it was delicious. As a crazy calorie counter, I found myself going back for just one more bite.... several times haha. It was worth it. I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. The salad's weren't as tall as I remembered but it was damn big. I started making a well in the middle eating my way outward. I thought I did really well in making a dent but nope. Stuffed to my throat, I waved the white flag and took the salad home. I added a head of Romaine heart the next day and made both my husband and I a big lunch the next day. This salad was INSANELY delicious BTW. The grilled chicken was perfect. Who doesn't love fresh corn. Fried Onions! YES! Avocado, Black beans, Tomatoes. It all just came together in a beautiful symphony.  ... We didn't have room for cheesecake- Bummer... But that didn't stop us from getting it to go! Oreo Cheesecake - Sooo awesome! 2 types of cheesecake up top with a 2 decadent layers of chocolate cake type fudge layers at the bottom. Red Velvet Cheesecake - Martha's Country Bakery does it better. This was on the sweet side in a not good way. Not bad of course but not as good as the Oreo. Overall, I really enjoyed our dinner.

Really good huge martinis if you feel like starting off with a drink.  If you are going for the first time, the menu can be overwhelming. You basically want everything. The southwest egg rolls are amazing if you want something a bit spicy. Every salad is huge and delicious and can be shared. Basically you can't make a mistake with anything. It's almost as if anything you can think of is on the menu  Then of course there's the cheesecake which you will probably have no room for. You'll have to loosen your belt or open a button.

It was super bland and dry and I hate when burritos are smothered, I feel like that automatically makes it an enchilada and that's not what I wanted. My fiancé ordered buffalo wings, which I liked, but only because I really don't like buffalo flavor and these wings barely had any so she was a little displeased. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while but I'm pretty sure I didn't enjoy my meal the last time I was here. I did order an Oreo dream extreme cheesecake for my birthday and I got through most of it, it was just really rich. But the location is great, I went for brunch with a few friends and my fiancé on Valentine's Day, I came a little late but I felt like my group hadn't been waiting too long. I definitely regret not ordering brunch food. Also, I ordered the Caribbean cooler and it was just meh.

In the end, we left after waiting over 40 minutes. Think about it, 40 minutes and the only thing on the table was water and bread.  When we had to ask about the soda, the waiter, Rick(?), was like, 'You ordered a soda? When did you order a soda? Okay, I can get one for you right now.'  He had to come back and confirm one of our orders and blamed it on the ordering system. We thought he just plain forgot to put in the entire order.

My only complaint is that my visit here on June 4th...my shrimp was a little over cooked. Never before though. I also had their Chocolate cake to go which was amazing!!!!  Very chocolaty.

I had the chicken and biscuits which was quite good and wife had some chicken over rice dish. Portions were very nice sized and we each took some home.

Because we were in a time-crunch, she made sure we had our food on the table as soon as possible.  One thing to note though, is that the portions here are huge! An appetizer+entree is more than enough to fill up two people, especially if you want to have room for cheesecake.  Tip: Expect long lines, especially during weekend nights.

For dinner my friend got the mac and cheese burger and I got the grilled chicken Caesar salad. She said the burger was delicious and I tried the sweet potato fries she got with the burger and they were a little soggy. Have to say though that I'm very disappointed at the cheesecake considering it's called the Cheesecake Factory, you would think that the cheesecake would be out of this world.

Walked into the downstairs area to see it's not being used so we go upstairs and there is a wait time. Why not use the downstairs area and not have a wait time? Got seated and placed my order with gf and best friend. Normally around this time the waiter would bring that bread basket that they usually do. But wait! This place is arse backwards and behold! They don't have any of the bread ready. They somehow ran out. So we had to wait for it. We put in our appetizer order and continue to look through our menus looking at the entrees. Some time passes and the waiter comes back and we place our entree orders. I ordered meatloaf since I couldn't really decide and it's a basic item that's not too complicated to make. Still no bread basket. We wait some more and the waiter comes by saying ""The bread will be here soon"". Another few minutes and we get our appetizers. We're eating them when this woman (Kathy I believe her name was) comes by asking who ordered the meatloaf. I tell her it was me to which she replies ""We've run out. Would you like to order something else?"". How does a chain restaurant run out of something basic like meatloaf? Am I missing something? Did every other person in this restaurant order meatloaf at the same time as me? It really boggles the mind. Kathy didn't even bother to offer me compensation for not having what I originally ordered. Finally, I know you're a waiter and have to make sure your tables are happy, but our guy is a little too attentive to us. He only passed by like 20 secs ago asking us how our food was and he just came by again. Ugh... will not be coming back here anytime soon. Everyone has gotten dessert but me.

During our wait 2 waiters came to the front desk one if which threw an item at the other. Funny all the people I witnessed kept rubbing their nose. Hmm I wonder why.  Finally seated, bread was not warm but at least this time is wasn't stale. I ordered a chicken parm sandwich I couldn't eat the bread because it was literally dripping oil.

The bread was freshly baked and warm; it was pumpernickel and white bread. My family ordered different dishes and had no complaints. For appetizers, we had spicy chicken wings, chicken dumplings and crab cakes. No complaints; we were all waiting for or entrees to come. I ordered from the Skinnylicious menu and had a turkey and avocado sandwich that came with a spinach and arugula salad decorated with vinaigrette-type dressing; I wasn't sure about the flavor. For dessert, we were all stuffed but still ordered anyway. Most of us ordered the low carb cheesecake. I was tempted but after looking at the calories for all the desserts, it was a day worth of calories. I said, ""No thanks, I like my size."" Last but not least; the drinks were awesome and since I was one of the bday peeps, I got try all of them (my family is the bomb, lol) So, if you are like martinis, I ordered the Tropical martini; it was good enough to get a buzz.. My oldest sister ordered Mai Tai, it was great. My other sister ordered a mojito, it was good too. My brother in law ordered the Ultimate margarita. He enjoyed it. My other brother in law got the Pomegranate mojito, it tasted healthy, lol. He didn't like it too much but I was on my second drink that time. I ordered a typhoon punch, it reminded me of the Jamaican rum punch. When I got home, I was knocked out on the couch, lol.  The service was good. We left the waitress an $80 tip. She took care of us.

I was so amazed at how big this cheesecake factory was.  Anyways, I didn't really like the fact that we were rushed when we waited for like an hour and 45 mins to get seated. When we order our food, we didn't get our bread... How do I know we were suppose to get bread??? because other tables had bread... sooo I am like where is my bread man??? The food came really fast which was great because we were hungry, however it didn't taste like it was prepare well... super disappointed because I feel like if customers waited this long to dine at your restaurant, be nice, take your time and prepare my food well. Here's the break down of the evening. 1. Cocktail: Georgia Peach was so good, you can't really taste the alcohol but it was yummy. For sure I was recommend that drink  2. Thai Chicken Wrap: Like I said, the food wasn't prepare well...The chicken was okay, taste like it's been sitting in the kitchen and all they did was put some sauce on top of it....  3. Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo: NEVER get the combo.... three pieces of shrimp and a small piece of salmon... don't believe me, look at my pics!!  4. Chicken Madeira: probably the only dish that was good throughout the night. portion was big and chicken was cooked.  Bottom line, would I come back again?

I've dealt with both terrible waiters and amazing waiters (Victoria, to be explicit, was one of the friendliest waiters I've ever had). The food is average, nothing special, but what should be expected of a chain restaurant? I come here when I can't think of anywhere else to eat, and I'm usually never disappointed but also never impressed. I very much dislike how close the tables are together. You can hear everyone and they can hear you; there isn't much privacy. It's also usually cold in there (I once saw a woman ask for extra napkins to wear them to keep her warm ROFL) and the tables are always .. Slippery? I'm not sure if that's the right word, but utensils are constantly sliding around and falling on the floor. Thank goodness they provide two forks. The only great things on their menu are, obviously, their cheesecakes.

Do my hands look nicer than my table mates, cause if so, then thanks.  Not so much. Our main waitress was friendly and attentive until she took our order and handed us the bill, but still very friendly and at the end of the day, no real complaints. However, the girl who brought our food, was so nasty, grumpy and rude. She just walked up to the table and instead of saying hi or anything, screamed out Pasta DaVinci. Then she rudely handed her plate to someone and then got nasty with me. Seriously, tone it down, we're at the Cheesecake Factory.  Our pasta had no flavor, cheese was never offered and my water cup was filled only once...because we had to ask....This is my first time at this location, but not at Cheesecake Factory.

Ann C.,"Whitestone, NY",44,288,301,5.0,10/9/2013,"Ten years ago, the Cheesecake Factory was the only reason I'd ever go to Long Island. It was the only thing Long Island had to offer before I discovered Ikea. We'd only make the special trip all the way from Queens for really special occasions. It was a big deal. So it was a huge surprise to me when I learned that true Long Islanders don't find Cheesecake Factory to be a big deal..or any deal.  Their laminated and bound menu takes 15 minutes to get through, even if you skip the ads. Their portions are huge and pre-meal bread is soft and delicious. There's always a wait on weekends and the amount of whipped cream they add to one slice of cheesecake is ridiculous. I don't care that it's a chain and you can get the same sort of food for better prices elsewhere. I don't care that a slice of cheesecake can contain enough calories to hold you over for weeks.

Our waiter was funny, witty and attentive which is always nice.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, my dad the Seared Salmon Salad and my step-mom the Luau Salad. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I had a good amount of ahi tuna, seasoned and cooked well,  the shallot vinaigrette that it was tossed with was good and the sliced tomatoes with pesto they were served on the side were fresh. I tried the luau salad and thought it was awesome. There was a lot going on between the massive wantons, the nuts and the peanut flavored dressing but I enjoyed every bite and will definitely be ordering that salad the next time I come.

Dr Z.,"Stewart Manor, NY",10,204,82,4.0,7/24/2013,"I go back and forth about The Cheesecake Factory. I mean, its extensive menu boasts some of the nation's most fat-, sodium and calorie-laden foods, dressed up with clever names and a hefty price-tag justified by the heaping portions. And that's before you get to the cheesecake. I am always excited by the prospect of going there, but get easily overwhelmed by the menu. After I cross off all the things I can't justify for health reasons - like not wanting to eat 5,000 calories, 80g of fat and 3,000mg sodium in one sitting - the selection is surprisingly narrow. The Skinnylicious menu has made an improvement here and I now find myself ordering from there or the selection of ""small plates"" that now supplements the appetizers. I actually prefer getting a couple of small plates to one big entree, so I'm happy with that.  The quality of the food is consistently good. The staff are hit or miss (either friendly and prompt, or dim and slow, with no in between). The combination of the ridiculously long menu and a potentially high turnover in staff means that your server will probably not know the menu well enough to advise on ingredients. And be prepared for a wait to get seated and in between courses, because it's always crowded.  I usually end up going for a few staples like the mahi mahi or chicken tacos, white chicken chili, or a flatbread with a small arugula salad. From past experiences, I would have always given this place a solid 3-stars. But on my last visit I made the wise decision of choosing something new to try, the Vietnamese Tacos. I was skeptical since a Vietnamese Taco sounds about as good as a Chinese bolognese, but the description had all the stuff I like. It was by far the best thing I've ever eaten at the Cheesecake Factory, cheesecake included. It was basically pulled pork with an asian slaw on a soft white bun. It was surprisingly fresh and light, but flavorful and filling. I'm sold on this fusion ""taco"" (minus the chiles). I paired it with the Beets and Goat cheese salad (with arugula, green apples and pecans) and they actually went really well together.  I have been put off in the past by the cost of food here, but you can skip the overcharged and grossly fattening entrees and also save some money by getting a couple of the cheaper small plates instead. The two I got came in around $10 and was more than enough food. To be clear, ""small plates"" is a bit of a misnomer. They are not, as the name might suggest, tiny or diminutive. They are merely the appropriate portion size that humans should be served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=420

The Cheesecake Factory is an elegant dining facility that lives up to its expectations. From the moment I arrived, I enjoyed my experience. The Cheesecake Factory has 2 floors, the lower for parties and busy weekends, the top for dining. The attire is casual-semi casual although it's recommended that one dresses up. The waiting time during a prime time weekday was excellent. I was impressed at the speed of the waiters because there was a massive amount of customers. The Upper Level has a bar that displays their classic cheesecakes. The drinks are great. The food is delicious. The menu is big enough to cover all your cravings whether it's seafood or Hand foods or Italian foods. There are a lot of alcoholic beverages that are very well for the adults.

This particular cheesecake factory is EXTREMELY crowded, but the place is HUGE so wait was only 15 minutes for my party of 2. It's true that for a chain the price is a bit high, but their portions are ENORMOUS! Here is what we had: 1. Mac and Cheese fried balls: Creamy, crunchy mac and cheese deep fried. need I say more? 2. Deep fried avocado rolls: the creamy avocado center with the crispy exterior wasn't the best part. It was dipping the rolls into the sauce and devouring this delicious creation. Get it. Get it when you go. 3. Eggplant sandwich: Delicious grilled eggplant and peppers in a hamburger bun. Delicious! Only thing I didn't like was the hamburger bun. Generic, too weak to hold the big slices of the eggplants and peppers. I had mine with the salad. Wish the dressing was on the side, but it wasn't over dressed. 4. Fish tacos: Huh, fish tacos at a cheesecake factory? Get it. Comes with rice and beans and the fish is deep fried.  Overall, very satisfied. After all this food, I couldn't eat their dessert. Amazing... My stomach could not handle the large amount of food I had devoured. I'll go back and try their dessert. Only reason this place doesn't get 5 star is because our waitress was missing throughout the entire dinner. A different girl came and waited on us. She was good, but again, where's our waitress?

Julias R.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2016,"Eek! Methink not for real. This past Friday I went out with my boyfriend to eat here. We usually come here every month two or three times because we love it. Needless to say, we will NOT be coming back and I warn everyone to do the same. First, we get seated and the waitress off the bat asks me if I ever been to the restaurant, i respond of course. She comes at me saying ""OH because if it wasn't i would tell you to put your cellphone away."" UM, okay mom? I am 27 years old, I worked hard and wanted to have a calm enjoyable experience. I order a lemon water, comes with no lemon. Next, we place our orders and I always get the same (turkey club with a side salad). My salad comes and I was turned off right away when I saw how oily it was, and my boyfriend also saw it drenched in oil and told me not to even eat it. I let that go, and decided to eat my turkey club. Now this is when I start to lose my shit. I notice there is a lot of mayo and barely any turkey and since its a triple decker sandwich i decided to remove the middle of. I discover its the bottom of the bread. I didn't even know restaurants did that and then felt insulted because for the kitchen staff to even put that in my meal and think I would never notice had me thinking what else did they do? So at this point, my boyfriend calls the waitress over who gets the manager, Chris. Chris looks at the sandwich which I didnt even take a bite of, and looks down and says ""Oh thats weird"" then continues to tell me how he is going to yell at the kitchen staff...okay what is that going to do for me? I wind up taking a few bites of my boyfriends sandwich and leaving him my credit card, because we're a modern couple and why not. I go to leave because I was disgusted with the meal while my boyfriend paid. $70 dollars later, i realize that we were charged for my awful meal that wasn't even touched.

My boyfriend and I got in at 4:20pm and was seated in 5minutes which was great. We decided on the food and ordered at 4:30pm but the food did not come until 5:10pm.  Just to rub it in our faces, the manager came to the table next to us (who was seated right after we were) and apologized about the food taking so long and offered them free salad, soup, and cheesecake. What really struck my nerve was that she went over to them multiple times to make sure everything was going well for them. Was it favoritism? Catering to them because they were older and had a child with them? Probably neither of these, but it's how I felt. :( We ordered a cheesecake to go after dinner and it took over 15 minutes for us to get it. Also noticed on my boyfriends mug of water had someone's lipstick stain. Nothing more gross than noticing this after dinner was finished.  I guess the only good thing that came out of this dinner tonight was that our waiter was excellent and super nice. He's not the one to blame for all the delays and unbalanced treatment that was going around by the manager. The food quality is generally excellent, and the bread you receive before your meal is great. Just this one night of irrational treatment and delays kinda ruined a lot of things for us. I mean... the restaurant wasn't even that busy for a Saturday afternoon/evening as there were several empty tables.

I guess being in Westbury, and being family friendly makes the families flock in hordes. Oh the horror! Yes, the patrons flooded in like army ants. Angry parents would accost the poor host, demanding to be let in or to speak to manager. Multiple requests would be made to the one man manning the front. Occasionally, the ants would maul one another for attention with the host. For a party of 6, we were quoted an hour and half wait time. Usually in New York, if I am quoted more than an hour of wait time, I would expect the best ramen in New York, or a free show to Shakespeare, but in Westbury, I just hoped for a decent meal. While waiting, we walked around the desolate mall. See my review of the Source:  When the buzzer rang, we were actually seated within the hour.  We also walked by the servers counter and got to view which food looked fresh and smelled delicious. The salads, steak and tacos looked appetizing. The bread basket they brought had fresh slices of rye and white baguettes.  We ordered Boston salad, fish tacos, white chicken chili and two burgers.The fish tacos had lightly fried fish with generous heap of salsa and black beans with rice. You have to eat it fast or the sauce rips a whole in the bottom of the soft taco. The fish tacos and the white chicken chili were surprisingly spicy. The chicken chili was so spicy, we could barely finish it. My hands burned slightly after eating the fish tacos. Interesting.  Out of all the food, the salad tasted the best: crisp lettuce and bacon, sprinkling of blue cheese and home made croutons.  Our waitress was this adorable Korean girl, who joked with our nephew. She was extremely sweet to our multiple requests. We gave her a generous tip.  Great for large groups. Two large parties of 11 were in the restaurant celebrating birthdays.  Very inconvenient restroom- all the way left on the first floor. You have to wade through crowds of people by the bar watching the game and little grannies waiting to get in. Would I come back?

I used to do the big 1-2 hour wait for a table (1-2 hours! Really!) but I just don't have it in me anymore.

I have never had a bad meal here. Their burgers are out of this world (I've had 4 of them and all have been great) as well as their fish tacos and orange chicken.  I'm normally not a cheesecake fan, but there's is the exception to the rule. I can't get enough of the Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple cheesecake.  There is a wait usually for dinner time, but for lunch (weekdays and weekends) usually doesn't take long at all to get a table. Prices aren't that bad and the service is usually great.

I've been here a few times now and every single time, I have been exceptionally pleased with the servers and the rest of the staff. There is someone who greets at a desk near the door and directs you where to go (I've only ever eaten upstairs). The hostesses are quick and friendly, and the servers are so very friendly and accommodating. The last few times I've eaten here, I have had Calo (Calogero) and Jose. Both of them made me feel like a friend during my entire meal, even though it was quite busy. They returned frequently to check our needs and were quick to refill drinks and bring extra condiments. I could tell from their other tables each time as well, that everyone felt well taken care of by Calo and Jose. I live between two Cheesecake Factory locations and will make this my primary go-to because the excellent service pushes it over the top.

They have an assortment of style so, sometimes when you're craving something just a little different than NY style it pays to drop by. Floors here for some odd reason are super slippery. During my visit I saw not only myself and other patrons nearly eat it on their floors, but also some of the wait staff. There are plenty of servers and they have designated areas it seems so when it comes down to being taken care of there is always someone around.

Michele W.,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",43,39,,3.0,10/18/2010,"It seems that 2 out of  the 3 entries I have so far are about a restaurant with the word FACTORY in it. I'm gonna have to analyze that one later.   The Cheesecake Factory is always a fun restaurant to go to, whether its to catch up with an old friend, which I did tonight, or hanging out with a few buddies and being silly.  The waitstaff is always pleasant, and in fact, my waitress hiccuped her way through our order.  It was endearing.  It is a chain, so if you dont have one in your town, let me tell you about it. These restaurants are usually HUGE and the one in Westbury, NY is located in a mall. It gets very crowded during peak hours, and the wait can be up to, or more than, an hour.   It's a bit overpriced, but its mostly worth it.  The Asian-type foods are not great.... for that you'll have to go to Chinatown or Flushing for a taste of some authentic foods.  But the American foods, like the burgers, and even the Italian foods are pretty good (though i'm sure the real Italians would differ from my statement).  I usually get the pasta.  Even the bread they serve before the dinner is good.  If you decide to go here, expect to gain a few pounds, because the food is rich and the portions are big.   And the cheesecake?  you HAVE to save room for the cheesecake.  Sometimes, i go here just to grab a cheesecake with a friend.  Actually, I never liked cheesecake (horror!) until i came to this restaurant.   All in all, a good experience if you've never had it.  It's A-OK in my book!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=580

Scott C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,7,5,3.0,8/24/2017,"Service - 1/1 Star The waiter that we had was very friendly and quick to assist with any issues we had. My girlfriend's order was incorrect the first time, the dish was completely wrong, and our waiter was kind enough to quickly apologize and retrieve the correct order. Maybe due to some unfortunate mishap in the kitchen or a lack of kitchen staff, the second time the dish came around, it was still lacking. The second dish was correct in order, but incorrect in ingredients and prep. I'm not sure if the chief was simply just out of it or wasn't feeling well, but the second dish was sadly prepared. Again we requested the help of our waiter to resolve this issue. Our waiter was a bit frustrated that my girlfriend's meal came our unsatisfactory again, so the waiter quickly called the manager over instead of refuting it with us. The manager noticed that the dish was incorrectly prepared and corrected it. The third time was the charm and the dish was perfect. Pricing and Quantity - 2/2 Stars The price of everything on the menu is expected of a medium class establishment and the portion size of everything is fantastic. The price you pay is definitely worth the amount of food you'll receive. Word of advice for those who are not big eaters: make sure you're hungry before you get the The Cheesecake Factory, or you'll be too full to enjoy your meal. Quality - 0/2 Stars Everything on the menu was mediocre, nothing pops up at you and makes you say WOW! While I was at the establishment I ordered a Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich with a side of French Fries for my choice of sides, the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, and Shimp Scampi with Steak Diane. NOTHING. I mean NOTHING out of that order was anything special. Literally my favorite item listed by me just now would be the french fries.... YES, you heard me, the fries... The chicken sandwich was literally the biggest piece of deep fried chicken cutlet I've ever had. If I wasn't a 6'1"" big guy, there's no way I'd be able to fit the chicken into my mouth, but I'm not commenting on the size of why it's inadequate, but the fact that it lacked any sense of taste other than crispy exterior with a slight hint of heat. The Shrimp Scampi with Steak Diane was just as bad, they had 4 pieces of cut steak with 5 pieces of shrimp and 2 pounds of mashed potatoes.... WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO EAT THAT WITH? As for the Bistro Shrimp pasta, I didn't even want to taste it after they got the order wrong twice. Total Stars - 3/5 I would definitely not recommend this establishment for personal pleasure. If you wish to simply ""experience"" The Cheesecake Factory, by all means, stop by. Do not expect a memorable dining experience other than mediocrity and terribly small bathrooms. They are a 5500 sq.ft. establishment with only ONE set of bathrooms, male and female on the first floor. Needless to say that the sink is by the door, if you aren't careful you'll be hit in the back with the door while you're attempting to wash your hands in their small ass sink. The men's bathroom contains two stalls and two urinals with one sink, while the female bathroom consists of three stalls and two sinks.... sounds like a fun experience. Best of luck to all that wishes to visit this Cheesecake Factory, but this will be the first and last time I visit this one.  P.S. I love The Cheesecake Factory.

Since I surfeited on an appetizer and my main course during my last visit, I had to pass on dessert; the portions here are gargantuan. My palate has a proclivity for the heaps of Mexican-inspired dishes, such as the Factory Nachos and the tortillas stuffed with chicken. The little corn fritters that come with the meal are a delightful surprise. Recently, I ordered two Long Island iced teas, and they were far too watery. After two iced teas from Whitman's Paumanok, one would expect to feel at least a sliver of warmth, but I did not. Also, this particular Cheesecake has been filled with crowded, frenzied chaos for as long as I can remember . . . which is all the way back to around the turn of the century. The downstairs space is underused and often closed for seating; the bathroom is on a separate floor from the main dining area; booming voices soar from floor to ceiling.

I call for reservations and they said they can't take reservations for more than 6 people. So I asked abt how long is the wait for 10, she said abt an hour. We have party of 10 which long wait was expected. We waited about 1.5 hours. The buzzer we got was defected and didn't notice our table was ready until I saw a missed call on my phone abt 5 min ago. I ran to the hostess immediately and ask for my table, there was a line to get to the hostess, by the time I got to speak to the hostess, she told me to go upstairs where they serve bigger party. We all went upstairs and they told me that gave my table away because they couldn't reach me.  We complaint that the buzzer and he said he called me few time. So, it's my fault with defected buzzer and I missed the call.  He told me that I will have to wait abt another 25min and will do what they can.  we're very upset but there is nothing we can do.

But, there was a sign to proceed up stairs and bam, there was so many people but luckily, there was no wait. I was seated immediately. Off the bat, you can tell the atmosphere of cheesecake was a cozy environment but a bit noisy with the chattering, plates clanking and kitchen cooking.  The menu had a great number of selections. My friend and I choose to stick with pasta, the Louisiana Chicken and Spicy Chipotle Chicken. We both got the lunch size, and felt it was already a huge dish. We can't imagine how big the regular portions are.  The Spicy Chipotle Chicken, I would definitly recommend to get again. It was flavorful, not too spicy; the chicken and pasta tasted great. The Lousiana Chicken was the opposite. Too heavy with the grease and oil, I only tasted the bitter wine. The chicken was tasty and very crunchy, which ended up being the best part of a pasta dish. I understand why it might be the most calorie filled dish on the menu now.  Overall, Cheesecake was a good casual place to dine in for a nice filling meal.

The wait for dinner, especially during the weekends are about 30-45 minutes but it's like that in just like any other good restaurants.  I absolutely love their complimentary pumpernickel bread. It's always warm, soft, and delicious. I usually order the Thai Lettuce Wraps and it's absolutely delicious! Even though it is technically listed as an appetizer, the serving is more than enough (just like any other entree in the Cheesecake Factory) and it's very filling. It comes with chicken with peanut sauce and an assortment of vegetables and other ""toppings', like carrots, bean sprouts, asian noodles, and cilantro. You pretty much make your own wrap with the baby lettuce and just add as much vegetables as you want. It's always very fresh, a great price, and it never disappoints!  The restaurant is almost always busy, but I've never had a problem with the staff as they were always friendly and helpful. Overall, it's a big restaurant with a huge food variety for the whole family, and it's delicious! If you're coming for dinner, just be prepared for a long wait.

The Pasta De Vinci is a must try. Some places make the chicken very dry but not Cheesecake Factory, their chicken is surprisingly tender and juicy. We come here for birthday celebrations many times. I give it 1 star less because of the wait time. Even you come in at 4pm for dinner, the place is still packed!!!

Nicole M.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",16,104,329,5.0,2/19/2017,We ordered shepherds pie and meatloaf from the lunch special. We ate only half and had the rest to go! They sure have a healthy serving. Their lunch special is until 5pm. So have that and you'll be fine! They're very fast with the food. They have two floors and was very fast in food delivery. Great tasting too!

Deliciousness ordered: sweet corn tamale cakes, fried calamari, bistro shrimp pasta, bang bang chicken and shrimp and we finished with lemoncello lemon torte. I must say, everything we ordered was amazing, we cleaned off every plate. I actually wanted to give three stars because of how poor the service was but the food is what matters most. Our waiter didn't check on us at all and we had to hunt him down everytime we needed something. We never got actual plates for our entrees, so we used the small plates we used for our bread. When we finished eating and were waiting for dessert, he didn't completely clear our table so we put everything aside. When our cheesecake came, it had fallen on its side and he didn't give us utensils. It seemed like he neglected us on purpose because he treated the table next to us a lot better.

Tasha M.,"Lido Beach, NY",52,58,165,3.0,9/1/2016,"I've been to this location several times, as well as many others. You can't go wrong with TCF, something for everyone. I'm a strict vegetarian and never get bored with the menu. I guess that is why I've been here so many time. It's pretty much the only place that can accommodate a bunch of picky eaters. My husband loves the Steak Diane and the fish tacos. I've tried the veggie burger(old version much better), loved the falafel salad (minus falafel),my falafel taste like I was chewing on sand and tin foil. I'm tempted to try the salad again, hoping it was just a bad batch of falafel. My favorite apps are the Fried Mac&Cheese,Avocado Eggrolls and the Parm-Garlic Cheese Bread. The wait staff is nice and when I had an issue with my salad management was understanding and accommodating. On the other hand, this was my 1st time dining at the bar. My only con was the Take Out counter, where they put the dessert which is also part of the waiting area. While sitting there we witness a kid coughing on the cakes that were for the seated patrons. As well as a woman who was leaning against counter playing in her hair over the desserts. All I could think of was all the desserts I ordered while seated. I love this place so much but that was a big turn off. So for food and staff I give them 5 Stars, but until the Dessert Station is changed i have give less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=40
Jc B.,"West Babylon, NY",244,71,126,1.0,1/28/2017,"Absolutely one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had!  We went here during a weeknight. Put my name down and was told 30 mins was handed the pager and literally a minute later it's going off. I was waiting for the gf to show up and it was busy so 30 mins seemed not to bad. I turned right around and asked for the table to be held and was allowed to do so.  Upon sitting at a two top right by the stairs elevators and wait staff section we were greeted by what the receipt says Cheri Anne g. Idk never got the waitress' name when she came to the table. So off to ordering from the most unhealthy restaurant there is with 97 pages. Decided to do the Buffalo blasts as an app. I got chicken and biscuits and gf got four cheese pasta with chicken.  Our drinks a Coke and a wine took 15 to finally get to the table. I asked for extra butter for bread as the waitress rolled her eyes and huffed and walked away.   Apps came. The Buffalo blasts are always great it's a creamy Buffalo chicken mixture inside wonton wrappers and a nice blue cheese on the side.  Dinner came. My chicken and biscuits which I was excited for until it came. There were peas everywhere. ALL OVER THE PLATE. the chicken was dry and everything was salty I mean kick you in the jaw salty. The pasta was so over salted as well  it was semi inedible. But I held my tongue. I asked for mine to be wrapped as I didn't wanna overstuff myself for dessert. As mine came back the waitress took the pasta dish off the table turned to the busboy and said I guess wrapping this because she waited till we came back. We looked at each other in disbelief at what we just heard.  We ordered dessert. We've been here about an hour at that point. And were making conversation with the table next to us. About 20 mins passed by when our waitress was standing behind us and was yelling up to another waitress on the steps above our head that she needed two cheesecakes because she forgot (ours). Literally screaming behind us over our head and walked away without saying a word to us. Two premade cheesecakes that waited 20 mins to find out they were forgot.  So another 10 mins passed by at this point I'm very angry. And what pushed me over the edge was the congregation of wait staff behind us with our waitress in the middle texting and laughing. Then the straw that broke the back. They start posing for selfies. This was the absolute worst service, worst food and worst experience I've ever had anywhere.  I spoke to a manager who tried to apologize but this from beginning to start was doomed as our server kept digging a deeper hole.  I will never...EVER be going to the Cheesecake Factory again and I urge all of you to stay away as well. Not only because of the service but the absolute unhealthyness of this place. I would give no stars if I could. Again my fellow Yelpers, STAY AWAY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=40
Elliott K.,"Queens, NY",408,193,381,3.0,1/16/2017,"Food is pretty good. I'd say you're paying average of 15-17$ for an entree, portions are average to large.  Seriously though, the wait is horrendous. Sunday night: We spent more time waiting for our table, than actually eating. We got there 6pm (no reservations), took down our party of 7, and waited about 1.5 hours. Finally when our device buzzed, they took us upstairs where we probably waited another ten minutes to be seated. Pro tip: send one person to come an hour earlier to take a buzzer. They go run errands in the mean time and all of you show up 15 minutes prior to time. Then you spend less time waiting.  Don't come here if you're in a hurry to eat. Especially for dinner, this will take a while. By the time you get a table, Jesus will have already come back.  It's packed. Just imagine: a lobby area packed shoulder to shoulder of probably 30-40 people, all of us holding a buzzer, waiting in expectancy that theirs will be the next one to ring. Seriously, a pregnant lady next to me had her water break, went into labor, and gave birth before her buzzer rang. An 11 year old boy hit puberty and grew 5 inches up to my height before his buzzer rang. A guy next to me went to the DMV twice and came back before he was called. Here's my conspiracy theory revelation as I waited there contemplating life: they make you wait so you'll get hungrier and want to order more stuff. By the time the bread comes out you devour it. Then the actual entree comes which is modest in portion, but by then, you're so full you thought you got a good deal. They get more $$ from items ordered, and you leave full and satisfied.

kallie s.,"Patchogue, NY",592,43,33,3.0,7/27/2017,It is what it is the food is OK but it's like any other chain restaurant. The cheesecake is good though. Menu is giant and the place tends to get  super crowded and the service definitely lacks due to that factor. I hate sitting in a restaurant with an empty glass while I'm eating. The ambience is very nice and the bar is well stocked. It's better to go in there for a game or lunch... I just feel like this place doesn't pack the punch it should when it comes to dinner. I have gotten cakes out of there a few times to go and some of their flavor combinations are very delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=40
Ami H.,"Castro Valley, CA",12,52,119,1.0,8/24/2017,"I frequently go to Cheesecake Factory; however, this visit was my worse visits. I come to a Cheesecake Factory enough to have a menu item that I order often, enough to know that they continuously add salt to their pasta water throughout the day to the point that dinner items will always be saltier than lunch items, and enough to know that their wheat bread actually has cocoa in it.  Here's what happened: I ordered a water with lemon, but the waitress cut me off and didn't even hear the lemon part. I was okay with this because it wasn't that big of an issue. I got the shrimp bistro because that's what I normally order. It came, I tasted it, and then realized it was chicken. I probably could've eaten it but the waitress just took my order back to the kitchen at fast pace. I got another dish, and this time, it had shrimp in it... I was picking at it and kept thinking there was something wrong with it... The sauce was incorrectly made and was just sheer butter and oil instead of the cream sauce that comes with the bistro shrimp. My guess is that the kitchen staff got the sauces and the meat mixed up between the dishes. When I told the waitress that the dish was incorrectly made and showed her the sauce, she said it's supposed to be that oily. Look at the pictures and see if that's the amount of oil a creamy pasta dish should have. I tried to correct her, but she just rushed to get her manager instead. He saw the sauce and explained that he wants to put the order into the kitchen so I can get my meal quicker. I told him that he should also check the salt level for the pasta water as well because it's overly salty. He didn't return to apologize or anything. I got my bistro shrimp, and it came the way it's supposed to be made: with shrimp, arugula, and a cream sauce. Normally at other Cheesecake Factories, I either get at least an apology, a discount on my meal, or a complimentary dessert/drink. Nothing was offered. Worse of all, I could feel the attitude from the waitress for the trouble I caused her cause the kitchen messed up. Her attitude was so real that she didn't even offer me shredded parm when my correct order did come out.  On the plus side, this Cheesecake Factory is HUGE. I can't imagine a long wait even when it gets busy. When it's not filled up, only the top is open. However, the bathroom is located on the bottom level behind the bar, and the women's bathroom has only three stalls and two faucets that are located right in front of the door. There's absolutely no wiggle room, and I felt bad for a mother an child who were washing their hands because the mom kept apologizing to me because there was no space for her to move to while assisting her child and allowing me access to the unused faucet. On top of that, the door opened and someone tried to enter; again, no wiggle room, and the mom apologized to that person as well...This has the largest dining hall I've seen with the smallest bathroom I've ever seen at a Cheesecake Factory location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=40
Evan C.,"Shirley, NY",1561,481,3496,5.0,6/8/2017,"I've been to ""The Factor"" many times, this is the first time I am Yelping it, mainly because I wasn't Yelping at that time long ago. We came as a group after a friend graduated college at the Barclay Center. It was nice, but it was also time to eat. We all threw out names but in the background some said the name that sent us all into drool mood ""The Cheesecake Factory."" Now if you know me you know I love cheese (Did I ever mention that?). So why no got to a place where cheese is in the name. So we geared up and headed back to Long Island. The drive was crazy but finally we saw ""The Factory."" Parking wasn't a problem, there is plenty. After we made are way in and we're quickly seated, which I'm surprised about because other people had the same idea and we were a ""Party of Five,"" get it! I made a reference to the hit series from the 90's, stop it. Anyway, the place is beautiful, it's always clean. I love the floors and the atmosphere in the place. You know it's always busy in here so the only thing is your around a lot of people. Also your listening to a lot of conversations as well. Our waitresses name was Melissa. Melissa was amazing. She was at our table and always polite and funny. I was impressed with her knowledge of the menu, that and her quick responses time to our drinks and such. When the food came out it was time to eat and that's what we did. I truly enjoyed the salmon, it was perfect. Everyone enjoyed there meals as well. I also sampled small pieces of all the cheesecakes and I must say they were worth the trip alone. I had quite the experience. When it came time to pay I had so much fun, I didn't mind picking up the bill. I will definitely come back again, I want a slice of cheesecake for myself.

Kristin Z.,"Freeport, NY",26,115,11,3.0,2/4/2017,"This place makes a fortune because we're all goofy enough to eat here despite inconsistent service and mediocre food.  Mother in law treated us to dinner so we ended up here at 5:00 on a Saturday. I don't recommend doing this if you value your sanity, or personal space.  Six thousand people in the lobby. 45 minute wait. We opted to stay but were smart enough to go upstairs and out the back door to sit on the couches in the now defunct and slightly creepy mall. We finally win the buzzer lottery and head to the upstairs desk, only to be told they're cleaning our table and we now have to wait in the horde of waiting patrons mixed with service staff trying to do their jobs. Not ideal for a family of five.  Now seated we meet Joe our server who was admittedly proficient and friendly.  We got menus and drinks quickly. Bread basket came a good ten minutes after we sat down.  But, it was warm!  Food was standard Cheesecake Factory- everything was good, nothing great.  The kid's chicken fingers portion is dismal. My burger was supposed to be medium and was basically only seared.  I don't mind bloody cow so I don't mind but, not what I asked for.  The real fun came when we ordered dessert. We got four cheesecake slices to go. It took TWENTY MINUTES to get them, after we paid!! We know it was twenty minutes because J went to bring the car around for MIL and came back in to search for us because he thought we got lost.  We open the cheesecake in the car and slices have shrunk since the last time we've eaten here, two years ago.  They're half the size.

Khorena B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,10,4.0,6/7/2016,"I went with my sister and her husband and we had a wait time of ten minutes. Luckily, it turned out to only be five and we were seated. The one downfall of this is how close the tables are to one another. Like literally, if you have some junk in the trunk you will probably knock someone's drink over. Prices are generally around 10+ most entrees are probably around 13-15+ We had a wonderful waiter. He was very prompt and spoke French to us and was friendly and helped without question. For the appetizer, we ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip which her husband and I enjoyed, but my sister says she preferred the one from Applebee's. When out entrees came, I was absolutely blown away by the portion size. I got the Guacamole Salad with an add on of their grilled salmon and I was already nearly full from the appetizer. I was not going to finish this! I ate about a quarter of it and I was stuffed. Everything was well seasoned and the greens were crispy and how a salad should be. My sister on the other hand got something with potato mash, broccoli, and herb crusted chicken and she was not enjoying it. She complained that the broccoli was bland and the chicken was overly salted. From a quick taste, I realized that she was absolutely right! Being full as well, she only ate part of her food. Her husband ordered the normal cheeseburger and fries. He asked for it medium-well and it came out char black and dry. He was really disappointed with the cooking on it but said that apart from the lack of juice, it was good when paired with the spicy mayo. Overall everything was delicious. We took the leftover food to go and the next morning the saltiness of my sisters food went away (we are still confused as to how!), my salmon was still delicious and our cheesecake was amazing.  4/5 solely for lack of space, hockey puck burger, and salty food. But I would definitely return here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=120
Eduardo F.,"East Elmhurst, NY",5,33,,5.0,3/6/2017,"First the ugly. This placed is almost always packed. When that's the case; waiting can be a pain in the ass. The waiting space is tiny, your best choice is to take the beeper they give you and go wait outside or wait inside the mall. Fair enough. The bad customer service really depends on the customers themselves. I've seen customers act like complete asses; which lends itself to how the servers do their job. Speaking of the servers; they are very nice. The level of humility to work there is really high. The only downs came when my Factory Burrito was prepare with peppers; despite the fact that I requested it without peppers. This happened a few times. It's fine; since it didn't ruin my dinner. Then; there was one time when the server tried to pull a fast one on me and gave me the incorrect amount of change. The entrees that are also on point are the Factory Burrito, the gumbo, the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, and the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken & Shrimp. Oh; the fried mac n' cheese balls are their best appetizer. If you don't want cheesecake for dessert, order the Oreo milkshake. You won't regret it.

The drinks were great too. What sucked was the waiter we had. I wish I could remember his name. He messed our drinks and refused to take them back, citing that was what we order when it wasn't. The manager had to come over to take care of us. After that he gave us our food and NEVER returned. He would walk pass our table and go to other diners. Not once did anyone come to refill our drinks or asked us if everything is good. For this, we gave a short tip. I understand waiters make their money on tips, but if you don't do your job I'm not wasting my money on you. He saw his tip and actually spoke to us!

The past couple times, it's just gone downhill. The burger- which is suppose to be medium rare ordered- has come well done or medium well at best, and the last two times I've had to sit and watch my date eat his meal while I wait for them to make a new burger. The service here is so inconsistent. I also am not a huge fan of how my issue with the burger was corrected this time around. If I have to wait 30 minutes after our appetizer for mains then another 20 minutes for my burger done to the correct temperature I ordered, then why am I not checked in on by a manager or something?

Alana M.,"Levittown, NY",26,22,,3.0,6/20/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory! It's more of an occasion place for me though. I find that this place is better when they're busy. Now I'm not sure if this is all their locations, but I'm the closest to the one to the Garden City location. I came here last night with my family. It was a Monday night around 7pm so we were seated almost immediately. However, our waitor & waitress were both awful. Our waitor spoke in the most monotoned voice. He gave off the impression that he didn't want to be there and he was uninterested in making our dinner nice. Anytime we had asked for more of anything or the bread they had forgotten, we almost felt like we were bothering him. I'll admit, myself or my family has never done a food service job before. We figured he was probably tired due to the gloomy weather, but when you're at work your supposed to take whatever you're feeling and put it aside. In the middle of our dinner he had to take a break and a waitress would step in for him. We figured he probably needed his break and it was fine with us. We were hoping he'd come back more cheerful.  When the waitress was helping us she had asked of we wanted dessert and gave us the menus. My sister knew what she wanted and I just needed the name of the cake I wanted, so we were basically ready. Before we could even tell her what we wanted she gave us the menus and took off. Again it was a Monday night, they weren't busy and it's not like she asked if we needed a minute. Finally when our dessert was being served, three staff members came up and sang Happy Birthday to me. Let me tell you, it was three women and it was the most quiet and pitiful Happy Birthday ever. I do kids birthday parties, I wasn't expecting anything crazy but the only people that knew it as my birthday were the table next to us. It was sad. It's a birthday not a funeral. Then she mixed up the birthday writing. She put the happy birthday on my sister's cake plate instead of mine. Not to mention my Dad's mashed potatoes were cold. The girl took my order and still got it wrong. As soon as the staff stopped singing our waitress disappeared. Didn't ask if we wanted more to drink, coffee, the bill, nothing. She just wanted to be in and out. I will say though, she was at least in a cheerful mood unlike our waitor. Our waitor came back and asked how the waitress did with us and none of us said anything. I just said, ""Well it was something."". He caught my drift and didn't say anything else.  I did have a great time. My family and I aren't the type of people to let something like this ruin our night, but that Garden City staff (at least the ones that waited on us) need some further training in dealing with customers and being attentive to your guests. I know everyone has a bad day, I understand that people make mistakes, but this was just a little much for a quiet Monday night. I never get to see my family often so I didn't said anything to a manager for their sake, but I certainly felt like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=100

They have lunch pasta specials for $14-17 and the portions are pretty desirable knowing how gluttonous cheesecake factory is. I've only ordered a cheesecake a couple of times coming here because im either too full from my meal to think about dessert or it's finally not busy for me to flag down my waitress to place an order. The table next to me at my latest visit looked as if they were done eating when i was seated next to them and ordered a cheesecake while i was still looking at the menu and they didn't receive it even after i paid the bill and was ready to leave. The waitress only checked in with them once and it was to let them know theyre backed up in the bakery right now and it was going to come out shortly.

At was 9:30 pm on a Sunday. We all needed to use the restroom. I can only speak of the ladies room. ""DISGUSTING""!!! There was paper all over the floor and one stall had poop spatter and there was a bathroom attendant. Wtf??? I didn't use the bathroom at all and left. I told my husband once outside and he told the manager downstairs which then took care of the bathroom. I still refused to use it. Nevertheless our Buzzer went of in less than the 20 minutes.

My son didn't like his Hersey chocolate cheesecake. We exchanged it for a different one and was told by our waiter ""ERIC B"" that it would be another 30 minutes for his banana cheesecake to come. We said ok and asked at that point to take it to go. Once again we waited extremely long for this one cheesecake to go. I look over to the dessert area and notice it's empty. So why is my order taking so long. My waiter ""Eric B "" is at the dessert counter just running his mouth while we are sitting at our table waiting.

Bianca B.,"West Hempstead, NY",94,7,10,1.0,7/15/2017,"I am currently here at cheesecake with my family and I'm a bit upset at the fact that my table has not been tended to for the past 45 min. We had noticed that the group that was seated about 20 min after us had received their drinks ,their appetizers and even their entrees in a timely manner. Our waitress was kind but not attentive. After a while I decided to ask the waitress if our food would be much longer to which she replied, "" I'm just waiting on the fries"".... 45 min waiting on just fries !!!! Fast forward we now receive our meal and mine comes about 7 min after every one...which is fine I don't mind as long as my family received their meals but I'm then told that my fries will be out shortly... really?.... 20 min later and now at this point no fries but she is here to pick up our plates. I then asked her to please remove my meal from the bill and she said she would get a manager.... another 20 min passed and no manager but she comes back and said ""So my manager would like to apologize and has removed your meal from the bill"" . I thanked her put my card in the little folder and waited for her to come back. 10 min pass and NO WAITRESS!!! You have got to be kidding me  at this point Cheesecake Factory is not so busy ..so where is she ? No clue ....so I got up told my husband to get the kids in the car  and I gave my bill to a different waitress that I could find at one of the computers. I am very upset with the service that we received.  The only reason I didn't leave earlier was because my family was hungry and they were already waiting for so long. On top of that my 2 girls had their burgers burnt mind you they ordered them medium well. I would of ask them to remove their meals as well but honestly that probably would have taken an hr from the looks of it .I would honestly not recommend coming to Cheesecake Factory with a large group seeing as that they can't handle more than one large group at a time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=140

Tiffany L.,"West New York, NJ",9,59,26,3.0,7/16/2017,"Food was as expected. The all American chain restaurant! I must say, their portions are outrageous- if you're super hungry, definitely eat here. Very affordable prices as well. The service is where it lost its stars. Our server did a good job, but the hostesses and management already put a sour taste in our mouths when we sat down. They gave us pagers for the wait and when we were buzzed, they were so disoriented as 10 other tables got the buzz at the same time. They had no microphone. It's two floors and chaos. Management just leaned over counters confused. After waiting another 10mins when we were supposed to be sat. They sat us down at a table that looked like a food fight went on. I think the hostess noticed my expression and mentioned that someone would clean up the mess shortly. Needless to say, no one cleaned it before our drink order, our appetizer order or before we left. There were 2 managers that saw the mess walking by and continued to frolic around joking about whatever while the servers, expeditors and hostesses all ran around with their heads chopped off. It all starts from the top. If management doesn't believe cleanliness or the restaurant aesthetics are important, the staff won't. Evidently, the staff could have used their support and help as well. So I would have enjoyed my meal more not having to sit and step in a food war zone beneath me and witness how the staff was left to fend themselves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=140

The service was good, we had a great waitress, took our order with ease, food came in a timely fashion, and boy was it good. I loved everything on the plate and the portions were a nice size. My friend felt the same about his. Of course for dessert we got cheesecake! Mine a mango concoction, good. His just original cheesecake and he enjoyed it.

Claumery C.,"Woodhaven, NY",19,9,1,1.0,6/19/2016,"Where Shall I begin? First and foremost, the staff here at the Cheesecake a factory are very sweet and pleasant  however, DO NOT let that fool you. The reason on why they are so polite is to fool you into enjoying the mess that they are about to dish out to you.  Here's how my night went: 1. There was a 20 minute wait for a party of 2. Which was reasonable. Once our table was ready, we were seated upstairs.  2. Once we sat down, I noticed that all of the silverware that was on the table was dirty with stains! I advised the waitress about it and she only removed 1 plate setting when clearly both sets were dirty. So I called the waitress back and told her that the other set was also stained and she responded by saying "" I didn't know his was dirty either"" 3. For drinks I ordered a mixed drink the Georgia peach. Apparently I must have been under age because the this drink was more suitable for a 5 year old. There was no alcohol in it. My boyfriend just ordered water.  4. We ordered some appetizers. We got the crab dip and the ratatouille.  - the crab dip appetizer was good HOWEVER the crostinis   That came with it were jaw breakers. It literally looked that they were submerged in oil and deep fried. I just had 1 piece and my jaw hurt and the roof of my mouth was sour which didn't make the rest of my enjoyable.  - the ratatouille was surprisingly good. The flavor a were there. Well balanced. The only downside to this dish was that the vegetables were not warm they were old.  5. For the main course, we decided to have pasta dishes. I mean after the appetizers fiasco we thought that pasta would be a no brainier dummy proof.  - Louisiana chicken Pasta: the chicken was encrusted with Parmesan cheese and deep fried, the chicken was good, it was a piece of breast and it was not dry. It held up pretty well. But the pasta? Come on! It was under cooked and chewy! Not to mention the heat level on the dish + the burns on the roof my mouth did not call for a good combination. The dish contained too many peppers. I didn't even bother to try the other pasta dish.  6. The waitress kept coming back and checking up with the status on how we were doing. We asked for a refill of the water but she somehow forgot and didn't bring another glass until we reminded her again 15 minutes after the fact.  7. Lastly, go with cash so you can just get up and leave one you are finished. Because check out takes forever!! After we had our meal, it was another 15 minute wait to have our waitress take out bill and 10 minutes to come back with everything.  This was my first, and last time coming to this place.  Note to the Cheesecake Factory: raise your standards, if you want your customers to continue coming back, then the service as well as the food has to be exceptional. When customers are dining they are in for the experience not just the food and having dirty silverware should not be acceptable. It's not just me who is saying it, read the previous reviews and fix it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=140

Long K.,"Bellevue, WA",95,365,862,3.0,3/7/2014,"Ain't nobody got time for the economic recession, when you can be dropping money at The C.C. Factory. 4-5 stars for good portioned food/cheesecakes. This particular location gets 3 overall since service was severely lacking. This is the type of place where you'd want more if you're only experiencing it for the first time. I was one of those guys years ago, until I move away from suburbia central and realized there's more out there. This location is attached to The Source Mall (seriously why does it still exist?).

Tamar O.,"Queens, NY",413,177,119,3.0,10/25/2015,"Ah, yes, The Cheesecake Factory. Always a pleasure to stop by for a meal and a slice of cheesecake with the exception of this past visit.  It all started out just wonderful. We were told there was a 30 minute wait which was no problem because we usually end up waiting much longer than that. So this was a pleasant little surprise. We were seated a little bit after our buzzer went off.  We always order an app, an entrée, and a cheesecake to split. If we ordered our own entrees we definitely wouldn't have room left for the cheesecake. And let's be honest, who goes to cheesecake factory without the intention of having some cheesecake? We ordered the crab wontons which were the best things we ate there. We ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp entrée which was pretty good but not exactly what I remember it tasting like last time I ordered it. The portion was a little smaller I believe and a little spicier, and it also had less of a peanut taste. The sauce for this dish is a creamy like peanut Thai sauce. Good, but inconsistent. The cheesecake we opted for was the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake. It was my least favorite cheesecake I've tried with them. It tasted like straight up pumpkin mix from the Libby's can mixed with cinnamon and cream cheese. Not impressed. In the word of Ron Burgundy ""Pumpkin cheesecake was a bad choice."" Wait or was it ""Milk was a bad choice""? Close enough! I also ordered a California Whiskey Sour which was delicious! It was a whiskey sour with a white wine mix to it. If you like whiskey and wine, you'll love this. I ordered two of them and both of them came out only 3/4 filled. Kind of disappointing, but still enjoyable.

On the downside:  Sometimes the wait for a table is a bit longer than I'd like, and if you get a dessert to take home, it will cost the same, but it will not have the garnish you'd get if you'd had it there.  For instance no whipped cream or berry garnish unless you request it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=220

Don't order the hibiscus martini, it tastes good but barely had any alcohol in it for the $12 price tag.

The food took over an hour to prepare, but because the server apologized, I wouldn't fuss over it. The other tables looked very upset & impatient, though. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. It was tiny Penne pastas in sweet Chipotle sauce, a bit too sweet for my taste. The Lemonade was VERY sour but not so much that I couldnt drink it at all. I understand that busier restaurants have certain sections assigned to certain servers, because I work in a buffet myself. BUT. The waitress with long, black, braided hair & blue tie was INCREDIBLY RUDE to me. Im assuming the table next to mines was her section & I wasnt. Not knowing that, I asked her for a refill of water after she took the request of the neighboring table.. And her response was DISGUSTING. Absolutely disgusting. She first looked at me like I was a lost child in a foreign country. Then she slowly said, in exact words, ""Uhhhh.. (pause)... sure???""  Like she was confused & didnt know what water was. Then she smirked and walked away. 30 minutes later, I asked my server for water & she comes up behind me & says in a demanding tone, ""Oh right. Give her more water."" And trots away. Miss, im sure you recieve your own seperate tips for your own table & dont want to serve for a table thats not paying you, but whats to say I'll become a regular customer &be seated in your section one day? I know the restaurant is busy & im just one customer but my first experience here has a bad impression now.

Thu H.,"JACKSON HEIGHTS, NY",178,7,,1.0,8/19/2015,"Once in awhile my friends and I consider making the hour drive for a huge selection of cheesecake and huge portioned food for matching prices. Aside from the expected wait time at these type of chains and difficulty flagging down your assigned waiter, we generally have a good time in the very spacious restaurant. It's just this one experience might've ended the long tradition of visiting the cheese cake factory.  We spent more than two hours at Cheesecake Factory and not by choice. I don't know how many complaints it would've taken for Westbury's managers to get the idea that our service was the worst. Our conversation with two different managers led us to believe their only solution to food service gone wrong is a slice of cheesecake and to reprimand their servers. Long wait time, wrong orders, cold food, apparently lost food, stale bread, wrong bread, dirty straws, dirty utensils, odd segregated seating, and condescending managers with their cheesecake.  Thanks to our apologetic and kind waitress, she managed to grab us the manager in regards to our out of the ordinary experience. The first manager came over to apologize about our long wait only and to make sure we realized they tracked how long we sat at the table so we're not allowed to exaggerate- THANKS FOR THE TIP. We said we waited an hour for food but we were sitting here for a total of an hour and a half and counting- sorry, is that acceptable? He offered us complimentary cheesecake for the wait. We declined not wanting to spend another minute there.  THEN the bill came- we were hoping to pay and get the heck out to celebrate elsewhere but they made errors on the bill and we had to talk to the manager once more and this time they sent someone else. (The waits for the managers are another taunting 5-10 minutes) We listed our complaints formally to the second manager who nodded along and kept asking ""and?"" -I'm sorry... Are six + complaints a low amount? Is the bench mark for courteous treatment at 20? ""It's on me, split it amongst the four of you"" His response to our friend's spoiled belated birthday experience appalled me. We've stressed that we're not here cause you problems and we normally like your service and are loyal customers. We were patient and quite understanding for all the blunders but at the very end it ended up being A LOT. This experience goes to show that you're apparently supposed to still pay for their mistakes.  Your servers were gracious to assist us in finding you.

Felix S.,"Flushing, NY",220,203,981,4.0,11/26/2014,"Cheesecake Factory- it's always the 1st place that comes to mind when looking for a place to celebrate birthdays and special family occasions. All Cheesecake Factories can be sum up with one word- BIG.   Dining Area is BIG-  I've been to around 10 different Cheesecake Factories in the past and I have never seen a small one and this particular location is no exception, I would estimate this place can probably seat up to 200+ guests? Food Selection is BIG- When they give you a book as a menu, you know you are going to spent the next 15 minutes studying it! The menu actually covers a wide range of cuisine from American, French, Italian to Asian and even Caribbean so there's something for everyone. Some of our favorite items here are: App: Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries (recent discovery, SO GOOD!)  Ahi Tartare Louisiana Chicken Pasta Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta Crispy Chicken Costoletta Luau Salad (this one is the wife's favorite!) Portions are BIG- No actually they are HUGE, you will go home with the next day's lunch 99% of the time. (that 1% of the time is when you have salad and you can't take it home cause it'll taste all weird the next day).  Btw Even their lunch portion is big  TIP: I love their pasta's here, if you are looking at the Garlic Noodle but don't want the grill chicken (they sometimes taste rubbery I feel you), sub it with crispy chicken (the ones on the Louisiana Chicken Pasta), it'll save you some calories and still taste great!! Desserts are BIG- Not only are the entrees big, their desserts are big as well. I always find it funny that the place is call Cheesecake Factory with an emphasis on cheesecake but majority of the time I'm way too full after entree. Maybe they should follow this order instead:  Drinks - Bread - Appetizer - Dessert - Entree Price BIG- Just kidding, I think prices here are quite reasonable.  Food here taste great and if you think about it, you are actually paying for two meals (lunch + dinner or dinner + next day's lunch) Overall Cheesecake Factory is great for both big and small groups, their service is good, food delicious! Just make sure you come early during the weekends cause the crowd can get BIG and try to restrain yourself from eating too much or else your tummy might get BIG as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=240

Farhana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",295,436,2031,2.0,10/27/2014,"I Love The Cheesecake Factory! After moving to NY, I was surprised to see that they don't have very many locations out here, since in Cali they're pretty much located everywhere!  Nevertheless, I was still excited that I found one not too far from Queens. I had my husband bring me here on day after work as we rushed to make it in time for their happy hour specials that I love. Sadly, upon arriving the hostess informed us that this location doesn't serve happy hour. WTF? Aren't all the chains operated the same way? What a shame!  So we decided to just have dinner. We had my favorite, their fried calamari for appetizer. Though this item is always a winner for me, the portions here are a lot smaller than any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. For entree my husband had their Chicken Jambalaya Pasta and I had my favorite Chicken Piccata with side of rice instead of pasta. This is absolutely my favorite place for Chicken Piccata. Though, I don't think I will ever order this item from here again!!!  After coming to this location several times. One night I had gotten food poisoning from the Chicken Piccata! OMG, the worst case experience. I was up all night vomiting and had really bad diarrhea  for several days. Not sure what went wrong with their food that night!  I did call and mention this issue to the manager, who took down the information and said he would call me back. No one ever called back!!! Horrible customer service and not expected from such a big chain. So, I called them again and spoke with another manager who took down my information and said he would also call back. Though I had given up, the manager did return my call and apologize for the experience, took down my address as well and said that he will have the food from that night looked over. He claimed, ""several people had the same entree and they didn't hear any complains."" But isn't it always possible that I was the lucky one to get contaminated?  Anyway, I let the issue go and several weeks later received a gift card from the location and an apology letter. The manager also took time to contact me and make sure I received it. I appreciated their effort, though due to this bad experience, not sure if it's a location I'd return to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=240
Steve L.,"Great Neck, NY",93,127,1,3.0,7/31/2015,"The last time I was at this Cheesecake Factory was when the Source Mall was still the Source Mall. I didn't even realize it had become a ""dead mall"" until today when I walked through the mostly empty mall that once had been full of life.  The good news is that the Factory itself still seems to be booming. We came on a Friday night and the wait for two people was about 15 minutes. The place was jam-packed full of people on both the first and second floors.  Our server tonight was excellent--friendly, patient and very capable. The one fly in the ointment was the amount of the wait. Along with waiting to be seated, it seemed like we waited an eternity to order, waited an eternity to get our entrees, waited an eternity to get a soda refill, and then when the meal was over I waited an eternity for the check. Our server would simply disappear for long stretches at a time.   I don't blame her in the least (and gave her a full tip), I just got the feeling she was being stretched to try to take care of too many tables at once.  As for the food itself, the cheesecake (which I've learned to always order ""to go"") was phenomenal as always. The entree itself, as always, was substantial in size but mediocre in taste. It's the kind of meal you see on a menu and your brain tells you ""yes, yes, yes"", but after eating about half of it your stomach says ""no mas"".  Something else that bothered me, although it wasn't the restaurant's fault, was that my very, very pregnant wife was standing there waiting for 20 minutes, and there were a bunch of young people sitting on the benches. Not one offered to give up their seat for her. Just for fun, I took my wife's shoulders and slowly moved her to the point where her belly was about a foot away from the nose of the 20-something woman and nothing. Come on Long Island, this is basic stuff.  In any case, still an excellent place to hang out with friends, generous soda refills (when you can get them), food that's better than eating the leftover scraps in your refrigerator, a phenomenal guacamole appetizer, and awesome cheesecake gets this place an ""A-OK"" from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=240

Drew promised bread - love the bread- looked forward to bread- Manager arrived and saved us from a carb disaster and got us bread immediately! Food was fine and met expectations. We then decided to take our cake to go. How long should one wait for cake to go? I think 25 minutes is too many minutes.

The place is always pack especially if you go on a Friday or weekend evening outing. The wait is usually around 15 to 30 minutes if you're lucky. Which doesn't make sense since they have an entire 1st floor that's always closed. They seem to never open it up and just direct everyone to the 2nd floor.  The food is okay and similar to Applebee's or TGIF. I mainly came here for the dessert to be honest. You can easily spend between $30 to $60 dollars here. An entree, a drink and a cheesecake will easily set you back $40 dollars.

This makes it a little easier because I dont have to go through all the other choices on the regular emnu. The only thing I really dont like about this place is the WAIT!! There seems to always be a wait no matter what time you come and they do not take reservations.  I suppose that can we a good thing because you know the place has real good food if thats the case.

The first time I had a bad experience, but the food was tolerable. Now this second time around we went for a Birthday, it had to be the MOST Horrific experience I have ever been faced with, at this restaurant!!! Upon entry the restaurant smelled disgusting!! After the 20 mins wait time we were told a hostess would come and seat us. We then began to wait 10 more mins. After the host approach us, she then proceed to walk us to the table. Once we arrived to the table, the other host gave are table to another customer. That was just the start! The host apologized as we walk back to the waiting area. She then sat about 10 different people before we had to go up to her and say ""did you forget about us!"" We then waited about 10 more mins as she than took us to a table after she said the next booth would be ours. While walking to our table I display to her there was a much better booth were we would like to sit. She then said I have to check and see if that could be arranged. She then came back and said no! That was the last strike we told her have a great day we are leaving. Instead of saying let me see what we could do she said bye. This is something that never should be done at a establishment!!

The waitress didn't return to check on us for another 15 minutes. She was not in the least bit apologetic about the error instead she remarked, oh this isn't your order is it? She returned within 10 minutes with meal I had actually ordered. It was awful, but still better than the first plate she originally sat in front of me. It honestly looked like something leftover from someone else's dinner. I didn't eat more than 2 bites of it and still left her a 15% tip.  My tip to you: don't waste your time going to this location.

Mike S.,"Long Island, NY",633,515,1990,3.0,8/25/2015,"I like how the Yelp page on a browser asks ""What keeps you coming back?"" when you check-in to a place more than once. Its a good question - why do I keep coming back to the Cheesecake Factory? I would have to say for me it is mostly about convenience or going with the flow. When you sit you are literally given a book sized menu - the pages are numbered and I think in area of 20! Add the ""Skinnylicious"" addendum for another couple of pages and if you didn't know what you wanted before you will be down right confused! On the plus side they will probably have the type of meal you are looking to eat. On the negative it will probably be fairly mediocre. On this occasion we split the avocado egg rolls - which were tasty. Deep fried egg rolls filled with avocado with other stuff means you can't go too wrong there. For our mains we went with the Tuna Tataki salad and the fish tacos, which I ordered grilled instead of tempura style. The tacos came 4 to an order which had a bland, grilled, inch and half piece of fish floating on top of the other ingredients like an afterthought. The rice served with this was dried out a bit and the beans oddly sweet. The tuna tataki salad was a decent salad, but not so sure it was the best cuts of tuna to be serving rare. The service was good, and the bill seemed a bit on the high side for the quality of the food being served. When we were leaving there were people waiting for a table, which seems the norm, but I really don't understand the draw of this place. Perhaps everyone else is just looking for a convenient place to go as well?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=160
Chidie-Ebere O.,"St. Albans, NY",9,8,23,5.0,4/2/2017,"Went here yesterday with my husband to celebrate my birthday and the food was amazing and very affordable, the decor was beautiful and warm, all staff from the check-in person downstairs, upstairs and the servers were all respectful and professional. We brought our 6 month old baby, and requested a booth even though we were two adults, and they were accommodating. We had our booth, sat comfortably and enjoyed the food. Only slight downside was that they were ultra packed, but I guess if you're that good, word gets out fast. I had the Jamaican Shrimp and Chicken combo (it was good but really spicy and has really bold flavors, so beware if you can't handle the heat). My husband had the Bang Bang Shrimp, and he loved loved it. I ate off of his plate (yeah, I'm one of those, can't help it) and wish that I had gotten the Bang Bang Shrimp instead, it was amaizing!!!! Didn't get any cheesecake because my hubby got me Ice Cream Cake at home and it's just too much carbs for one weekend, but will be back for the Cheesecake and Bang Bang Shrimp soon.

Sherry C.,"Hicksville, NY",101,193,719,4.0,9/6/2015,"Not bad.. But I've been to better cheesecake factories. This is a beautiful restaurant like the others but I was pretty upset they didn't give us the bread right away.. Come on. Their wheat bread is delicious but they didn't bring it. I was pretty disappointed since it was my friend's first time there. Moving on... I ordered the meatloaf (they didn't give me the lunch meatloaf) and my friend ordered the four cheese pasta with meatballs. Our waitress comes back and apologizes for not having meatballs so we changed it for chicken. I don't have a problem with that. We also ordered the avocado egg rolls and got a slice of banana cream cheesecake. These are the issues I had with this place: My friend and I couldn't finish so the waitress offered to pack it up for us. She gave us our food in the individual bags saying this one is mine and this one was hers... I came home only to find out my delicious meatloaf isn't in the appropriate bag!... I guess the waitress tried so it's okay.. Next time (there will not be a next time by the way), I'll pack my own food. The cheesecake slice we ordered was pretty sad looking. The staff compensated by smothering it with a lot of whipped cream and banana slices. The palisades mall location did it much better. Overall, I give them 4 stars. Please don't forget my delicious wheat break next time and don't give me foreign food....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=160
Ron B.,"Bethpage, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/22/2017,"Have repeatedly attempted to resolve and credit my account for being charged for 4 dinners when our party of 3 had 3! Waitress brought the incorrect meal. Finally fixed it. No one came over to apologize. In a rush I paid the bill quickly and even left a 20% tip. When I reviewed my receipt a week later saw that I was also billed for the incorrect dinner in addition to the 3 we ate. ( waitress removed the extra dinner - did not give it to us to take home etc, so why should I be billed!) Have called 3 times to ask for a refund for the meal, tax and the 20% tip I gave on that meal.  Was told certainly, they would get back to me, in addition I would get a gift card for my trouble.  Waited a few days, no call, no card, no revision on my credit card. Called again. Very sorry, etc etc.   Waited another week - nothing. Called again. Was told that a gift card was sent to me to cover my troubles.  Not a credit. Just a gift card. How this changed from what I was told by the others is beyond me! Told them i had not received it and want my card credited. They Finally agreed to do it. Oddly then got in the mail a gift card for $20  for my getting the wrong meal - no mention of them also  billing me for it! The Meal was $18.95, tax is 8.625% and my tip was 20% so my expense was a total of $24.37....not $20.  I am not being anal but why should I be out the extra $4.37? And today I see where my cc was credited for the meal plus the tax. But Not for the tip. So they assume I should still pay the tip on what I never received! Meaning that $20 gift card is now worth about $16.50. Check your receipt and if waiter / waitress doesn't write down your order - ask them to! Check things twice - bill it right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=160
Samuel C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,28,,4.0,3/2/2017,"Been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times over the years, its a good great food. Honestly you cant really go wrong here, one of the best chain restaurants around.They have a huge menu, seriously its quite a feat, with lots of variety. Not a fan of the pastas and pizza though. The appetizers are all excellent, intact last time we went there my brother ordered 2 appetizers, the buffalo blasts and nachos. I'm partial to the burgers and meatloaf, they really seem to do meat based dishes really well. The cheesecakes have the same verity as the rest of the menu, from plain cakes, a variety of decadent chocolate, fruity cakes, and even a peanut butter cheesecake, for those of us who like salty with our sweet.  Only downside is the wait times. I've only been here for lunch, we had to wait a while, and I'd imagine dinner time is more crowded. The wait times once the orders were taken are kinda long but not completely unreasonable considering how many people are usually there. On the plus side never once had an order screwed up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=160
Ian C.,"Flushing, NY",36,2,2,5.0,8/20/2017,"Came here with my wife and kids for the second time. The first visit was for my daughter's birthday which took a while and on the second visit was for me and my wife's anniversary which takes only 5 minutes for a seat. There is a wide selection dishes on the menu, from Italian to Caribbean food to good old American dishes. Once you take a seat at your booth/table you feel like the mood is set for a romantic dinner, as the lighting dynamic changes as the daytime goes to night, it almost feels like the restaurant is truly lifelike. While you wait shortly for your friendly and well-patient waiter/waitress, you can listen to the wide range of music from today's to the classics. The waitress that we received was very attentive to what we wanted, she didn't even have to write down our orders, almost like she had a photographic memory! She checked on us every once in a while, seeing if everything was OK with a smile. The dish that I had was a Jamaican influenced...it tasted really good, but I am just going to give you a warning for people who do not like to have spicy food to be cautious at the succulent pepper that this dish brings to the table, unless you can drink several cups of water. And now for the star of the show (in my eyes)...DESSERT!! Actually, cheesecake in fact (although there are other types of desserts to choose from like cake, ice cream etc.).My daughter had the Raspberry cheesecake and she said it was very good, it was not too rich. My wife had the Tiramisu Cheesecake a la mode and I had the Strawberry Shortcake a la mode with ice cream.

I told a hostess and all she replied with was ""Ok"" and gave me a napkin to clean it up myself.  3-Ordered kids food first since we waited so long, and a quesadilla took forever to come out.

Jimmy T.,"Flushing, NY",471,27,63,1.0,11/28/2015,"My beautiful girlfriend asked me to take her to The Cheese Cake Factory.  I regretfully obliged.  We arrived at 4pm and were seated with out a wait.  We ordered fried Mac & Cheese balls to start.  The balls were over cooked in the fryer, and tasted as if they were reheated in a microwave oven.  I then ordered the California Cheese Steak sandwich with fries.  The menu described it as sliced steak, but really it looked and tasted like gyro meat.  My fries tasted old and were as hard as a rock.  My girlfriend ordered the salad and pizza lunch.  The pizza was wet and soggy, and resembled and tasted like a pizza you might find in a bowling alley.  Her salad was fine.  We also ordered the a slice of cheesecake and that was good.  Our waiter was nice and very helpful.  The manager was shocked when I spoke to her and voice my displeasures.  She told me everything is made fresh including the pizza, which was obviously a bold faced lie.  I felt ripped off, and sick afterward.  You may be able to go to your local super markets frozen food aisle and create the same experience and quality as this restaurant for a quarter of the price.  The manager did take off the pizza from the bill... BIG WHOOP.  Too bad she can't take the stomach ache I have now from eating her cooks SHIT food... Never will return. Ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=340

No complaints there. And the appetizers and entrees are mediocre.  The dessert is what their known for. Cheesecake and tons of variation of the cheesecake.  I recently tried the tiramisu cheesecake and it was great but the strawberry is by far still the best cheesecake from their menu.    Id skip the food and just go straight to dessert if I could, but mama taught me better than that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=340
Ari C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,3,5.0,10/24/2016,I can't say enough good things about this Cheesecake Factory! I have been to at least 15 Cheesecake locations around the country. We were in town for a wedding this past weekend and we were staying very close to Cheesecake and thought we'd stop in for dinner the evening before. It is always one of my favorite restaurants and this location did not disappoint. I got a 'happy' vibe and the service was fantastic! Our waitress was named Rachel and she went above and beyond. My husband is on a low sodium diet and she advised us on the menu. My favorite part of the meal is always the avocado eggrolls and I finished with the vanilla bean cheesecake with chocolate dipping sauce. I love that Cheesecake Factory has such a huge menu and there is always something for a picky eater. This is the perfect place to indulge.

I just had Cheesecake factory for dinner from the westbury (source mall) location and I wasn't impressed.  As far as service, I did curbside pick up so it was fine I was put on hold for maybe 2 minutes not bad at all, they took my order and said it would be ready in 20 mins.  I went to pick it up 20 mins later, parked right in the curbside spots and grabbed the food so service was fine everyone seemed friendly.  The food wasn't great though. My boyfriend got the buffalo blasts which are usually amazing and crunch but these were soggy and seemed like they've been sitting for a while. I got zucchini sticks which was served with blue cheese (weird, everywhere else serves with sauce which tastes great) I didn't like them i had maybe one or two. I also got the teriyaki chicken which is a favorite dish of mine and I have had from the Huntington location before and I remember it being great!

Banana Cream is my favorite.  This place gets crowded often but it also depends on when you go. Weekends? FORGET IT! You will be waiting more than 30 min easy....however, during the week almost no wait time. This restaurant is 2 floors but they have an elevator and a beautiful circular stair case right in the middle. Downstairs dining seems more casual while upstairs seems much more upscale. All waiters I've experienced have been extremely nice and helpful. Service is always impeccable and food delicious. The only complaint I would say is the Menu is HUGE. SO many things to choose from! But all the reason to come back over and over. You can also take cheesecake to go which is nice!

Trinity S.,"Plainview, NY",2,8,,1.0,11/19/2015,"I usually really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory. However, during this particular dining session my feelings were the complete opposite.  My fiancé and I usually go late night after he's done with work & it's usually busy. Which is fine ! We were say promptly but no server was in that section. We seemed to be the only table ! So after 15 mins of nobody coming over I decided to go up to the host station and explain. The hostess rolled her eyes and headed back to the table and said ""you don't want to sit here?"" I said we do, but we WANT a server. It's been 15 mins. She then again rolled her eyes, and snatched our menus off the table and walked away. After a few steps she turns and says ""well if you want a server you have to move"". I almost lost it. She was the one who sat us in the first place! Yet she's giving us attitude ? We brought it to the attention of 1 manager who apologized and said he would handle it. After our entree a different manager came over and asked what happened because both the hostess and initial manager left. It was such a circus I just wanted to get out of there. So much so, I refused the free dessert. They need to hire more personable staff members and make sure they management is aware of all problems as they happen! Their communication was clearly lacking.

Anisa C.,"Floral Park, NY",0,7,,1.0,2/1/2017,"So my friends and I used to always come here for late night cravings over the summer. Ya know like cheesecake after the gym. Stuff like that. The customer service is usually pretty good. However last time(about a week ago), we came on a Sunday night around 9pm. It was a half hour wait which we were fine with. (Side note-While we were waiting we saw the manager trying to speak to a customer that was clearly very upset about the customer service.- we should've taken that as a sign) Once we finally got seated our waiter greeted us. He seemed very nice. Little did we know, we would be waiting longer for our food than the initial wait to be seated. When we did finally get our food, my friends did not enjoy their meal whatsoever. I happened to enjoy my mac n cheese burger so I wasn't complaining. I'm guessing their must've been a new chef. They both ordered pasta(one with chicken and one with shrimp) and it was not seasoned well at all. I tried a bit from both of their plates to see if they were just being dramatic and they were not. It tasted like air.... like nothing. NO FLAVOR. So that alone was a disappointment. We were clearly not the only ones with the issue. The family next to us didn't enjoy their meal so the manager came over and told them she would take it off the bill and asked if they'd like to order anything else. I guess they were frustrated at that point and just wanted to leave so they asked for the check instead. After the manager finished speaking to them, I called her over and told her that my friend did not enjoy her meal which was pretty much untouched(the other friend still scarfed down his pasta because he was starving). The manager kindly offered to give her a complimentary cheesecake. The waiter then came over and took my friends orders for two cheesecakes to go. Just when it couldn't get any worse, we waited AT LEAST 20 minutes for the cheesecake. He gave us the check and still didn't bring it. After about 25 minutes we asked him again for the cheesecake which he had completely forgotten about and turns out it was sitting in a bag behind the counter the entire time. He just forgot to bring it to us. Disappointing meal, bad customer service. Overall not the best trip to the Cheesecake Factory.

It came adorned with cole slaw,crispy applewood bacon,bbq sauce of course, sweet onions, and topped off with spicy mustard. The sweet potato fries were crunchy,a tad bit on the salty side,but water helped alot. The cheesecake I had was amazing (chocolate mousse,btw), I had the ill foodgasm.

Fire Roasted Artichoke - over ordered Chicken Lettuce Wrap - definitely get this!  We got it Asian style.  It was so crisp, fresh, and refreshing.  Plus the two dipping sauces were great. Pear and Endive salad - was also a must get.  I have no idea what was in the dressing but it was good...  Plus the salad was enough to feed three people... heaping plates too! Service was good considering that it was very busy... we had to flag different people on some occasions.  Alas.... The perfect end to a low calorie main is of course to order a cheesecake... per person... at 1K+ cal. per slice... agh... we were doing so well!  Their cheesecakes are good (snickers tasting one and a raspberry lime that was not terribly tart) but I always confuse the their strawberry shortcake vs junior's strawberry shortcake.  Different... not bad since it came with ice cream but I should've gotten a bowl of strawberries instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=480

The specialty cocktails are really good as well, maybe that's why I couldn't finish my tacos? Do I even need to discuss the dessert. Get the Tiramisu! The only thing about The Cheesecake Factory is that I spend about 15 minutes pouring over the menu because it's so expansive, there's literally something for everyone on there.

A few of my favorites are the fried Mac and cheese and the pretzel crusted chicken fingers. I wasn't a fan of the guacamole here, which I usually like everywhere. It came out very warm and bland, which may have just been a fluke. My favorite meal dish here is the pasta carbonara, although it is quite pricy. It almost goes without saying that the cheesecake is amazing, especially the Oreo and Godiva ones. Love this place, although it is impossible to get a table at night without a long wait.

Staff everywhere looked miserable - I had to stand in front of the hostess for 5 minutes to even find out how long the miserable wait was - then she looked SHOCKED when I said I'm not waiting and told her to take my name off the list, she just looked confused, like people don't normally do that!!   Then since we really just wanted dessert - we headed over to the take-away counter, the girl there was a little bit more friendly, but still kinda miserable. Only redeeming factor was that she got us out of there quick!!

When the waitress came with the gin and tonic she was saying I know, I know it took a while and left. Then she notice my boyfriend had the car keys on the table and stopped by the tables to say she was waiting for fries it would be right out . Exactly 59 mins from when we placed the order the food comes out and to our shock the fries were dead cold.  Keep in mind the restaurant was not crowded since it's 11pm at night and there was only two other tables in the waitress section.

Staff does not use gloves when they move cakes around and isn't mindful that there are cakes in the fridge when they are cleaning with sanitizer! It took over 20 minutes to box up 5 slices of cake without anyone else ordering plus there were a lot of staff behind there. Servers are sometimes nice to us but most time, they seem to like rushing us. Not sure why. I think we eat here very often to say we're regulars. If I could give no stars, I would.

I got dinner last night with two friends and they shared the avocado egg rolls as an app, and almost bickered as to who should get the last one.  They ordered the Santa-Fe salad, and the Chinese Chicken salad...I'd never seen anyone order a salad here so when they arrived at the table I was wonder-struck at how huge they are! That wasn't just dinner, it was next day's lunch.   I went for the Americana burger sans pickles, and it had potato sticks on it so I felt like a real 90's kids eating my burger with no shame across from both my friends having salad (sorry, not sorry).  Fries were honestly not as crispy as they usually are, but that didn't stop me from finishing them either.  We shared a slice of tiramisu for dessert, almost a sin at CHEESECAKE factory but majority just wasn't into it last night.

Daniel C.,"Saint James, NY",83,107,538,2.0,10/12/2017,"I've been coming to this location since my high school days and from what I remembered the service has always been good and quick here. I came to this location for a family members birthday, we were a party of seven. We arrived right around six o'clock on a Saturday evening, the wait was about 45 minutes to get a seat.  When we got our table the waitress took a little while to come over, we ordered our drinks and put in our appetizers. We ordered the Tex-mex egg rolls, crispy crab bites and the warm crab and artichoke dip. Heres where the night turned a little sour, our drinks and bread took a about 10minutes to arrive along with another 30 to 40 minutes for our appetizers to come to the table. But the kids pizza, chicken tenders and fries came out pretty quick. The tex-mex egg roll was pretty good, nice crunch and the filling tasted good along with the avocado sauce on the side. The crispy crab bites were okay and the warm crab artichoke drip I would have liked better if they served it with chips instead of grilled bread. The grilled bread was a little to oily and hard for my liking.   For the Entree I ordered the Grilled Ribeye Steak, my wife ordered the fish tacos, and our cousins ordered the pork chop and crispy chicken and shrimp pineapple. The entrees took about another 20 to 25 minutes to come out after we received our apps. The steak was okay, the mash potatoes needed a little more milk because they were drying out. My wife enjoyed her fish tacos and our cousins said their dish tasted good also.  Our waitress came to check up on us about two to three times, we had to flag her down to order our dessert. The only reason we ordered dessert is because we had three kids, you can't leave without having dessert as a kid. We ordered two slices of cheese cakes, one vanilla bean and the other oreo. By the time we received our cheese cake we already been at the place for about 2 hours after we sat down. The whole night from start to finish took about three hours, our waitress took forever to come to our table to give us the bill, once the bill was paid the night was finally done!  Will not be returning to this location again. We haven't been having good luck in Cheese Cakes factories!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury

The party next to me told me they received the same treatment. All I can say is what in the world sort of tactic is this? Some variation of bait and switch? Ridiculous and never coming back.

It wasn't too bad of a wait for a Weekend (don't remember if it was Saturday or Sunday) evening. We even got a booth!  I'm adding a star to this rating because of the impeccable service that evening.  For the app: - stuffed mushrooms - fontina and parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce Drinks: 2 glasses of Sauvingnon Blanc from New Zealand Entrees: - Grilled Turkey Burger - Combined with fresh mushrooms, garlic and spices. Served with grilled onions, lettuce and tomato on a wheat brioche bun - Chicken Marsala and mushrooms - chicken breast sauteed with fresh mushrooms in a rich marsala wine sauce. S Dessert: - 2 Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake - a cjocolate hazelnut cheesecake topped wth hazelnut crunch and nutella The food was great, no complaints there. The service was ON POINT, though!  Our server was Anthony. He was polite, attentive, pleasant, and quick. I guess at some point he took a short break and a woman took his place. I didn't catch her name but she, too, was awesome. Hopefully, Cheesecake will continue to give great service like this. The food paired with great service made my experience that night an awesome one. Awesome enough to upgrade my previous 4 star into a 5. They should commend the 2 servers.

Josh G.,"New Hyde Park, NY",241,456,4146,4.0,5/7/2017,"I know, The Cheesecake Factory is a chain. But it's not a horrible chain. It doesn't run rampant through towns and cities and states popping up on every corner, trying to ""be cool"" like some other chain restaurants *cough* Applebees *cough*. The Cheesecake Factory does enough to warrant the occasional four stars and my last trip here was pretty close to that celestial amount (maybe 3.5).  Even on a Tuesday night, with TCF connected to a mall that now resembles something from Dawn of the Dead, you'll still run into crowds. I know you can't sit customers at a table without a server, but once we were seated, I noticed several empty tables around us. This is starting to become a thing I truly despise. Having said that, the party of three I was amongst sat in about twenty minutes, so wait time was acceptable. Call me crazy but I do love the decor in Cheesecake. I don't entirely get it because it feels like some classical, contemporary, European style, but it sets a mood better than a lot of other chain spots. I've also had respectable service here almost every time I've been. That night our waitress was close to on point. Or she was standing next to the point, or in front of it. I digress... Maybe some of the reason there's often a wait at TCF is because you're given a novella to read. Literally. The menu is a book of choices that you can't begin to comprehend. Often I'm stuck between at least two or three dishes. Calorie count might knock a choice off just because the amount in some of these dishes is shocking, but there are healthy-ish choices mixed in and available (""Skinnylicious"").  The winner for me that night was the Cajun jambalaya pasta. Shrimp and chicken sautéed with tomato, onion, and peppers all in a spicy Cajun sauce over linguini. The dish was large with the chicken and shrimp holding nice tenderness and a great accompaniment to the veggies and pasta all brought together with a good kick of heat. I pushed through the last few bites just because I was diggin' the meal too much to take a doggie bag home. My stomach made room, somehow. We received a breadbasket at the start of the meal so a piece soaked up some spices from the pasta. My chum also wanted an appetizer, so prior to Cajun land, I shared some fried macaroni and cheese balls with him. Gooey and oh so fattening but enjoyable. And of course, there was some cheesecake eating. I was stuffed but the rest of my party dined on a piece each. Selections for style is also vast. I mean we are in a factory for cheesecake right? By the end of the meal (throw a Sam Adams in there too) the price wasn't entirely cheap, but basically worth the dollars I doled out of my wallet. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory isn't perfect. It does wear the scarlet letter (or word) of a chain restaurant. But if you're not sure what kind of food you're lookin' to devour, you have some picky eaters in your party, or you're just nearby, The Cheesecake Factory will fit your needs, and fit them better than your standard chain spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury
Cassie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",284,145,331,2.0,4/6/2017,"I'm definitely a fan of their cheesecakes especially the Dulce De Leche and Key Lime flavors but unfortunately that was the only things that we ordered that was good. My entire party of 7 was underwhelmed with their meals. I had to send back my order of Fettuccine Alfredo with Shrimp because the pasta was completely over done and quite bland... It was promptly replaced by the manager for a slightly less overcooked version. Even the drinks were subpar and didn't even taste like there was a drop of liquor in them. On the bright side, we were seated in 20 minutes for a table of 7 on a Sunday. The service was amazing. Our server was attentive and helpful in removing the awfully crafted Mai Tai from our bill. The manager was readily available. All that positive did not make up for the bad food and drink preparation. I have had amazing meals at various Cheesecake Factory locations even at this particular location. The kitchen may have been having a bad day but can't risk having another bad food experience at their regular menu price.

Michelle Z.,"Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, NY",17,26,36,2.0,11/11/2017,"This has been my to-go spot since middle school with my mom after a long day of shopping. I've never had a problem here before until Thursday.  I can't complain about the food because it's always the same. It's not the best, but not the worst either.  Definitely not a problem to find parking spots. Wait should not be too long either depending on which day and what time you go.  Now on with the service. I don't ask for much when it comes to service, because I know what it's like to be a server. My mom, who does speak and read English fluently, always have a hard time picking what she wants to eat. So I go on cheese cake factory's webpage and show her photos of their pasta. Our server, Leny (can't remember if that's how you spell his name), made our dining experience horrendous. Not only did i feel disrespected, but my mom as well. I should've said something on the spot, but i didn't want to cause a scene.  I asked him a couple of questions about the menu, and the third time, he was frustrated. I understand that maybe it was because I asking questions, but it is his job to answer them patiently and guide me through my options. He was not that busy, because it was 3PM in he afternoon. The restaurant was half empty. I was showing him photos on their website and asked if it was offered for lunch special. He reiterated the entire pasta menu as if i couldn't read English.  Then, I was ready to order and my mom wanted the Evelyn's pasta. I wanted to make sure that it was only vegetable, because she does not like to eat meat. He flips the page onto the pasta menu and says, here is everything. He was super impatient when it came to ordering, that he took our order down and left.  I was done with my water half way through the meal. He passed me twice, staring right at my cup, and did not come to refill my water or my mom's water once. I was literally sipping on my empty cup and making a sound to deliberately see if he would do anything. Nothing. My mom and I finished our meal quickly and could not enjoy our dining experience.  When we took the check, he asks us ""would you like dessert? A cheesecake? You can look at more photos online haha I'm just kidding."" My mom, who does not even understand English fully, heard the condescending tone in his voice.  I just hope the manager of this restaurant takes notice of this matter. Biggest factor of dining out is service. Even if the food isn't superb, a great service makes up for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury
Andie E.,"Manhattan, NY",54,144,858,4.0,8/19/2017,"I've been coming to The Cheesecake Factory in Westbury ever since they opened, many years ago.  When they first opened, the long lines to get a table were ridiculous.  Years later, the lines are still long, but I've learned to come very early to avoid long waits.  This restaurant is located in the Source Mall....on a side note, what the heck is up with this ""mall""?  There's practically nothing there.  If anyone is looking for retail space, this mall has plenty of space available!  lol So I haven't been here in a while, and noticed that they now have a ""skinnylicious menu""!  What a great idea since most of their menu items have huge portions and have high calories!  So they cut down on some of the fatty ingredients and the portion size to make the calorie count much much less than their ""regular"" menu items....but WHY don't they cut the price?!?!   One of us ordered the steak medallions from the skinnylicious menu and the portion size was half the size of my chicken dish from their regular menu;  and they were both the same price.  Now I know you can't really compare steak vs chicken but it just seems that all the prices on the skinny menu were the same as the regular menu....just sayin'!  Kudos for having a skinnylicious menu but the pricing needs a little work since the portion sizes are much smaller. I've had many different food items through the years, and I have to say that I have always liked whatever I ordered. The complimentary honey oat bread and sour dough bread are made fresh and served warm...perfect for melting the butter!  Sooo good!  Their food is also delicious!  Yes, the food can be fattening.  Yes, the portion sizes are huge.  But if you're really watching your weight, coming to The Cheesecake Factory is probably not such a great ideal....unless you've fallen off the wagon!  lol  I don't come here often but when I do, I don't think about any of this stuff.....I just enjoy it all!  And believe me, there's ALOT to enjoy!   And don't forget to save room for their cheesecake!  If everyone can agree on which type of cheesecake to get, it's best to just share one or take it to go.  There's just so much one can eat....isn't there?!?!  Hahaha",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury

She was so nice the kids gave her husgs on their way out of the resturant.  The food, service, appetizers, drinks and ambience are FANTASTIC.

I went for a friends birthday.  First off, it's huge. On this particular night the bottom floor was closed for something that looked like training, but the top floor was huge as well. There was no wait (at 630 on a Tuesday) and the server greeted us and took our drink orders right away.  The menu was severely overwhelming but I could see the appeal that a large menu has. They had everything from salads, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, Chinese, steak. Definitely something to please anyone and everyone.  I settled for southwestern egg rolls, while my friend had the four cheese pasta and we split both.  The food came out extremely fast and it was delicious!

The food is really good - if you know what you are ordering.  I don't think this place is fool proof, in that you can close your eyes and order and will be satisfied..

Mishae M.,"Newark, NJ",20,60,141,3.0,4/16/2012,"First off i start by saying, the restaurants absolute specialty will be their cheesecakes, you cannot go wrong with them, any cheesecake i have had from the factory has always been magnificent. However, the food is just not that good. The first time i had their food was a plate brought home to me by a relative who had went and ended up having a lot of food leftover, it was a angel hair pasta dish that tasted like an 11yr olds first try at making an Italian dish. Literally oily pasta, barely seasoned chicken and tomatoes with a bit of Parmesan cheese, was the meal. So my expectations were set pretty low when i finally had my first date with the restaurant. I have to say i was blown away by the ambiance, the architecture of the building is truly breathtaking and it has a very calming atmosphere. Once again though, the food was a total fail. My mother has ordered a penne pasta meal that was absolutely horrid. No seasoning whats so ever, it was if the chefs think that merely pouring olive oil over a pasta dish will bring out the taste.FAIL! I had a Margarita pizza which contained no sauce, thought the pizza was at least decent. We both had a glass of zinfandels wine which was excellent but had no reflection on the restaurant because it wasn't as if it was a house brew and ended with a cheesecake which of course did not disappoint. My advice is eat dinner before going there and then end the night with dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=540

Has a little kick to it but not too spicy where its unbearable. For my entree I usually get Teriyaki Chicken (Without the bone) and substitute the rice for a side of Mashed Potatoes which is mouth watering! And a bottle of Pinot Grigio or White Zifendel to wash it all down. Dessert is also very good, I'm stuck on the Godiva Sundae .... I love chocolate so if u do too I'd highly recommend this! ....

Alex Y.,"Little Neck, NY",17,9,6,3.0,7/31/2011,"Been here a few times, as well as other Cheesecake Factories around the US and you gotta love a good default for when you have no idea what you want to eat. I don't remember where i heard this, but the best private chefs are usually the ones who have cheesecake factory under their belt. Why, do you ask? Because they learn to cook just about everything.  At first glance the menu is quite comprehensive and overwhelming . It's good if you're not sure what to eat, as it offers tons of choices, but it's also bad because ordering can be a chore. I do have a few things that i have come to consistently like from this place: (be advised, the portions are pretty big so don't go nuts, or you'll never get to dessert) -Avocado Eggrolls- Yes, i do see the irony of a china man suggesting eggrolls, but they're actually pretty good. Love how the eggrolls mix with the tamarind dipping sauce. - Buffalo Blasts- Essentially, buffalo wings with out the pesky bones -Chicken Madeira - Chicken is moist and usually done right, the Madeira sauce is part sweet, part savory, which goes well with the chicken and the mashed potatoes that comes along with it. Must try for newbies to the chain. -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta- This is also a good choice for those who want pasta with a bit of a kick to it. The chicken and shrimp are relatively tender, but the pasta varies. I've had it where it was relatively al dente, and other times the pasta sticks to each other and seems a bit over done. -Dessert-? a lot of creative cheesecakes concoctions to choose from.  All and all this place is a great default if you're in the mood for something, but can quite figure out what. There is usually a wait on the weekends, so take that into consideration if you're starving. The decor is nice, very spacious, but the floors can be a bit slipper and the lights a bit too dim at times to read the menus. The reason this gets a 3 and not a 4 is because, the menus are a bit too much at times to find something quick. the food is good, and there are some stand outs, but nothing really hits you as wow, and the waits can be quite long. Otherwise, this place is definitely worth a try. =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=540

The reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because some of the dishes are a bit overpriced and I have never been impressed with any of the wait staff.  They act like they are doing you a huge favor for any request or question.  Overall, a great place to grab dinner and a drink with a friend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=460

Greg G.,"Baldwin, NY",0,7,,2.0,8/13/2012,"I'm only giving two stars because the food was good, but the service was downright terrible.   On a Sunday afternoon, after being seated, a waiter takes our orders for drinks then disappears for twenty minutes until a new waitress is assigned our table and takes our food orders.  So immediately we wasted 20 minutes on nothing.  Then the food arrives and half my order is missing (I ordered the soft tacos which are supposed to come with rice).   My friend orders a sandwich which comes out ten minutes after my other friends had received their food.  So we tell our waitress what happens and the manager comes over and asks me and my friend ""Do you want a slice of cheesecake""  Naturally I thought the cheesecake was free because they asked my friend and I if we wanted it.  So it turns out that I end up paying for the cheesecake after they took off the tacos from the bill. So you may wonder why am I complaining if they took it off the bill? I didn't want cheesecake in the first place, they tricked me into thinking it was free by having the manager come over and say ""Oh we're so sorry would you like a slice of cheesecake to go"" which is completely ridiculous!  Why would a manager offer something to a disappointed customer and then make he or she pay for it!?  I would have rather have just had the tacos taken off the bill and leave it at that instead of being fooled into buying cheesecake that I wasn't even in the mood for just so they could get my money off a slice of cheesecake that costs them nothing to make. Other restaurants that this has happened at usually the manager is CLEAR about what he or she plans on doing to make the customer satisfied.  At cheesecake factory it's just one huge mess. ** I will add that I had come here in the past (about a few months or so) and I enjoyed it both food and service.  Perhaps the place hired new workers since I was there last because this time was a complete mess and waste of time.  I won't be going back for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=620

They are consistently good, every time I come here I have a very nice meal. Also, you can't come here and not try their cheesecake. My only complaint is that there are too many, I can never make up my mind because they all look so good! Last time I tried a new one I never had before, the banana cheesecake. All I can say is WOW, it was amazing! Their other cheesecakes are also equally as good, well at least the ones I've tried (chocolate, pineapple and strawberry).  And yes they are a little expensive, but with the quality being so good, it's worth it. Expect to wait at least 30-45 minutes to be seated as they are always packed at dinner time.

I do find they are a little heavy handed on the pepper in the kitchen.  Their spicy chipotle chicken pasta was very good, thats if you like spicy.   I think their cheesecakes might be better looking then they taste.  I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory in the past to try cheesecake,  never to sit down, and eat and I find that their cakes are WAY TOO SWEET!!. I feel nauseous after a few bites lol. I stick with my low carb, sugar free, cheesecake with fresh strawberries.  You have to go either during the week when its slow or have the time to stay the wait.  They have a bar downstairs where you can have drinks while you wait.  I would return here but I don't think anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=620

Christian B.,"Freeport, NY",170,212,97,3.0,7/11/2012,"Can't believe I've forgotten to write a review on this place.  Over the years since it has opened I've come here. I've tried many of their dishes. I was here just the other night with a friend. Jumped on yelp to update a review I thought I had written previously (I fail) lol...We ordered Avocado Egg Rolls, Chicken Madeira, Fresh Grilled Salmon, Fresh Strawberry Shortcake, Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake, and of course their famous bread. Oh that bread, I like the brown pumpernickel bread. I'm not a huge fan of the sourdough one. You can't just have 1 piece of it. The Avocado Egg Rolls were YummY. (Avocado is known as a super food, FYI) with the sauce that came with it. I prefer having the Chicken Marsala dish over the Chicken Madeira. The sauce on the Chicken Madeira was great. Although I'm sure you would be happy with either of those 2 chicken dishes. Their Shepherd's Pie is also really good. My friend enjoyed the Salmon dish. The mash potatoes that came with both dishes were really good but wow so heavy. To drink we decided water with a lemon was good enough. The sweet drinks here are way too sweet and I personally just didn't feel like drinking any alcohol so... Before I used to get their strawberry lemonade drink. Its non-alcoholic but yeah that hit the spot. My friend said the Cheesecake was really good. My Strawberry Shortcake was OK, I enjoyed the ice cream that came with it. I've had better. The downside to this place is their food is just all SO RICH. Forget about calorie counting here. If you are actually counting calories this is not the place you should be at all. Sure it tastes good but now I""m probably going to spend the next 2 weeks picking up my cardio at the gym just to burn off what I ate here recently. The decor is nice. The food is just so Rich. Their portion sizes are pretty big. Oh, I also really enjoy their salads too (didn't wanna forget that). This is worth visiting at least once. I'm sure you'll return again. This is a place I personally may only come once or twice a year at most and that's only if a friend really wanted to go here. Just because the food was again SO RICH lol...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=520

My favorite thing on the menu is the Sweet corn tamale cakes... it is 3 pattys of sweet corn with chopped avocado, drizzled sour cream, and a drizzled spice sauce. Also the Mac n cheese balls are great! They are so tasty. When we come here we get appetizers so we can save room for 1 of their 32 some odd cheesecakes! I would recommend this place to everyone!

Wolf G.,"Delray Beach, FL",272,228,185,4.0,12/28/2014,"After going here with my friend last week for dinner, I could certainly say that based on my experience, The Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chain restaurants I have been to due to the high food quality, good value, and great service. We arrived here for dinner at 8:00PM, where we were greeted by a friendly hostess on the second floor of the restaurant who took our names and promised to have us seated in a booth. Ten minutes later, we were seated in one of the back rooms in a window facing the inside of The Source Mall, which was very comfortable. In addition, I found the decor to be somewhat upscale, with bright yellow colors on the walls and somewhat dim lighting. We then met our waiter, whose name I do not recall, but I remember he was tall and skinny with a goatee. We both felt that he was friendly, fast, and on point, not unlike my experiences with other servers at The Cheesecake Factory. After ordering beverages and perusing the textbook sized menu, with its many dishes as well as caloric land mines, I decided to order the Tuscan Chicken with a substitution of Mashed Potatoes for Farro due to my gluten allergies off of the Skinnylicious Menu while my friend ordered the Sandwich, Soup, and Salad Combo, which included a Turkey Sandwich, a Caesar Salad, and Corn Chowder. We received our food not much later and I enjoyed my Tuscan Chicken, which had two generously sized pieces of tender and juicy grilled chicken breasts drizzled in a sauce of pleasantly acidic yet sweet balsamic vinegar, a bite of basil, well-cooked and nutty asparagus, ripe and juicy tomatoes, and fluffy mashed potatoes. While I did not try my friends food, he enjoyed all of the components of his meal and I thought that his dishes looked well presented. As we were eating, we also received excellent service from Carlos, who cleared our dishes efficiently and with a smile. Since I still had a little stomach space and wanted dessert, I decided to order a bowl of Chocolate Ice Cream with whipped cream, as I am allergic to the eggs and wheat found in their other desserts, like their Cheesecake. I found the ice cream, which was a healthy portion of about three scoops, to be delicious as it had sweet and robust chocolate flavor with a creamy and cool texture. I also enjoyed the freshly made whipped cream, which was fluffy, creamy, and not overly sweet like commercially processed whipped cream. While this meal was not quite inexpensive, at a about a little bit over $40 for everything, I thought that the price was reasonable due to the high quality of the food and large portion sizes. Overall, I feel that The Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chain restaurants I have been to and I would definitely return again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=520

Our sever, which like always I can't remember their name, because I'm always excited and talking. I was wowed by our waiter, even though it was super busy and he probably had 5 tables at the time. He introduced himself and took our drink and appetizer orders. He talked in such a professional and clear manner. We were a party of 6, he took all of orders and we didn't even needed to repeat ourselves!!! He read them back and I was happy. My mom had the gumbo, even thought my mom doesn't even have the idea of what gumbo is and it's extremely picky, loved it !! Everyone loved their food and finished it all.

Erica P.,"Bronx, NY",10,8,2,4.0,3/18/2012,"This is my second time visiting the Cheesecake Factory and i have to admit i am a bit hooked. My friend took me a week ago and it was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I just thought that they only made cheesecake. Boy was i mistaken.  I am in love with their ""Ritz Martini"" which contains champagne, triple sec, courvoisier and pomegranate juice. Can you say ""DELICIOUS""!!!!? My friend introduced me to the ""Louisiana Chicken pasta meal"", which contains Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms. I also ordered the ""New Orleans Shrimp"" which is shrimp with some tasty sauce, peppers, mushrooms and white/brown rice. I do wish there was more shrimp as for some reason restaurants are always stingy with shrimps. I also ordered two cherry cheese cakes to go and the server forgot to charge me or place them in my carryout bag. He was overall a great server as he did not need to write down our order and was very friendly, but i guess not writing down the order hindered him from not remembering my order in full. I called the restaurant when i arrived home, about this as the cheesecakes i ordered were not in my carryout bag, and i wanted to ensure i was not billed for  the ""mystery"" cheesecakes. Luckily i was not, however the manager (Keith) was concerned that i did not receive my cheesecakes and has now offered two slices of cheesecake for free. I just have to go within the next two days. Now how to do that with public transportation i will have to figure out later. Overall, i love the atmosphere. The waiting time was 20 minutes around 7pm, which was not bad at all. The waiting area, though was a bit chaotic and claustrophobic for me, but it could have been much worse. The staff was very personable and very efficient.

Haze P.,"JAMAICA, NY",32,55,23,4.0,8/16/2012,"I come to the Cheesecake factory almost twice a month. The only thing that I keep going back for is the cheesecakes. They have a great variety of cheesecakes and every time I go I end up bringing at least 3 other cakes home. My favorite is their 30th Anniversary Cake, which is layers of chocolate and cheesecake. Their Oreo cheesecake is also good, second favorite.  But let me just say the only reason why I give this restaurant a 4 star is due to their cheesecake. Everything else is not that special. Out of all the times I've been there, my food was never great. It usually is merely okay. Atmosphere is nice, but since it's such a big place, it's actually quite noisy. Plus if you're here on the weekends, I would say minimum wait time is about 2 hours.  Since I'm not wow by their food. Now I usually eat somewhere else and come for their cheesecake afterwards.  Just a side note, I heard Grand Lux Cafe is connected to them. And their food is MUCH BETTER. Even though they don't have the same dessert menu but it's worth a try if you're a little sick of Cheesecake factory's food.

You just have to time to go 30 minutes or so before you want to eat, or go before 6 pm. I used to come here once in a while after shopping with the bf, its the perfect place to go when you cant decide what you are in the mood for- they have a little bit of everything and CHEESECAKE- hello always in the mood for that. ----However--- I stopped coming here once it was required for restaurants to post calorie and nutrition info on their menus. You can not get anything here that is less than 1000 calories, plus you can not go here and NOT get cheesecake who does that? and the cheesecakes are over 1000 calories! I'm no calorie snob but no one in their right mind should be able in good conscious sit there and eat 3000 calories. You must be insane!  Anyway this past weekend we said fudge it lets be fat and when we got the menus I was happy to see a new ""skinnylicious"" menu. DUMB NAME, but happy its here. And they had alot of options that were tempting in comparison to other chains that offer a ""lighter"" menu. Burgers, tacos, steaks, seafood etc all on the skinny menu. I chose the white bean chili with brown rice (less than 500 calories) and topped it off with key lime cheesecake a la mode because my ass isn't big enough. we had a great time, ofcourse my bf did not choose an entree off the ""skinnylicious"" menu but no matter what he eats he remains a 32 waist.

For dessert my parents and I split the red velvet cheesecake and the Kahlua Cocoa cheesecake. WOW!!! This cheesecake is a trillion times tastier than Juniors, or any other place where I've eaten cheesecake. They have so many different choices from raspberry lemon, to vanilla bean, to Reeses peanut butter cup, to banana cream. I cant wait to go back and try more flavors. I also forgot to mention that I absolutely adore the decor! it's totally old school Hollywood art-deco themed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=660

Angie C.,"Oceanside, NY",39,110,59,3.0,10/8/2014,"Me and my boyfriend planned a date to dave n busters today but after he read a lot of reviews he already didn't want to go. We got there and no one was there and it was dirty so we decided to eat at the cheese cake factory and go back for games. I can't remember our servers name but he was very nice. We came once before and never came back because the service the last time was awful. This guy was very nice I think he told another table he was fairly new,but he still seemed to knowledgeable and even said to ask for him next time we come. Maybe Eric? But I'm not sure. Anyway we each had two rounds of drinks my margarita was really good but the first time it wasn't filled up to the top at all , and my boyfriend asked for a glass for his beer and had to wait 10 minutes because they were out of them....it wasn't even busy. The second time it took the drinks about 20 minutes to hit the table but it wasn't the servers fault he came by a lot and let us know the bar was backed up. I was going to cancel the drinks if I saw him again without them. We got the nachos as an appetizer. They were really gross, we barley touched them and the server even asked if we liked them but my boyfriend said it was fine because there was previously a problem with my soda it had black stuff floating in it. We didn't want to complain again. I wasn't crazy about My burger either and the fries tasted like cafeteria fries. My boyfriend got the steak Diane, it tastes really good and he loved it. We got the peanut butter Reese's cheese cake...adams something? It was delicious! It was so good I wish that I just had that. I was disappointed that the bill was 90 bux .....110 bux with tip and I wasn't crazy about anything I had!!!! I feel like you can rack up a high bill really quickly here, none of the drinks have prices and neither do the desserts. I really practically hated everything I ate but my boyfriends food tasted really good. I just don't know how you can mess up a burger. I would say my boyfriends experience was a lot better than mine.

Mike Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",71,190,62,4.0,5/25/2009,"Cheesecake factory is cheesecake factory. It's a big, popular chain located in nice upper class suburban environments. Theres always the dim lighting, painted ceilings, menu with advertisements on one side and food on the other. No matter what you get the servings are huge.  Now don't go looking for the best meal of your life...but it is really good, always consistent.  There are a lot of different types of food to choose from and everything I've had has been good. I really enjoy the thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer, especially during the summer time as the lettuce which you wrap grilled chicken in with vegetable fillers such as cucumbers, shredded carrots, sprouts as well as noodles tend to feel really light but hold just the right amount of flavor (because its customized depending on how much of the three different sauces you add on[peanut, something, and some other thing]) for dinner i always am a sucker for the meat loaf.  i am a loaf kinda guy.  the meatloaf is good with the right consistency, sauce w/ onions.  mashed potato and corn sides. the chicken and biscuits is just pure comfort as you're eating large portions of chicken and biscuits smothered in gravy with mashed potatoes. steak la diane also good...but i would pick the meat loaf over it. The waitresses are attentive, portions are huge for the price...which is not outrageous considering the ambiance provided. i like cheesecake factory.  this one gets bonus points for us being seated immediately on memorial day at 9 at night (yeah...i know most places wouldnt be that packed at that time but still it was nice)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=660

Dora D.,"New York, NY",0,6,,1.0,11/11/2012,"The WORST dining experience I ever had took place at this Cheesecake Factory. To begin, it was Thursday night after 9PM, so the wait for a table was not bad. We got seated in 5 minutes. Everything went smoothly until after our waitress took our order. We noticed that our table and this other table were the only ones without bread. Which is fine since I did not want to be stuffed before our food came.  Little did we know, our appetizer took more than 20 minutes to arrive! Meanwhile two tables that came later than us were already working on theirs. I let the waiter know how long we waited for and he snaps back at me saying that's not what is says on his computer when he brought over our dish. Then some guy came over, who I assumed was the manager because he never introduced himself, told us that our appetizer was freshly made that's why there was a wait. Since he had an excuse, it felt as though he didn't want to hear what I had to say. That did not explain why the 2 other tables got theirs 10 minutes prior to ours and their plates looked more complicated. We ordered the Fried Mac & Cheese Ball, it does not take that long to make. Plus, when the dish came out it was only warm, NOT HOT!  After we finished our appetizer we FINALLY got bread! They must have just been letting the dough rise when we got there that was why we waited over 30 minutes for bread. Our waitress explained that our order did not get placed in the system, but how come she didnt't check? Meanwhile the other 2 tables were chowing down on their entrees. By then I am beyond annoyed and would had just paid for the drinks and appetizer and walk out if it wasn't 10PM and many of the restaurants are closed. Sadly by the time we got our entrees one of the table next to was paying their bill and ready to leave. I waited so long for my food that I lost my appetite even though I was hungry to begin with.  I ordered the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya Pasta. It was nothing special at all, very bland for something called cajun because I am expecting a lot of spices. Very disappointed.  After our waitress brought back our entrees, she asked my boyfriend, not me if he wanted water. And as expected she brought back one glass of water so my boyfriend asked her to bring out another glass. I didn't think she liked me because that took her 10 minutes to get meanwhile I saw her chatting away. The wait this time might be the ice cubes weren't frozen yet. Apparently our waitress was new, but there were many times where I could not find her to ask her where our dishes were or she would be chatting somewhere. I had new wait staff wait on me before and they were actually really good, so being new was not a good excuse.  One thing that really got me annoyed was if she made a mistake and knowing that our dishes are delayed kindly tell us before hand and not when you serve the dish! I would had understand. Again this is a Thursday night, it was not that busy!! Second thing that annoyed me was how the ""manager"" treated us. He never came to check back on us how the dishes went or on how our experience was, so much for management. If you are going to have a manager who works like that then no wonder your wait-staffs are below par.  To sum up my review if I could give NO STARS I would. Food was mediocre and service was nonexistent.  I will never come back to this Cheesecake Factory and I will not recommend it. There are many other restaurants in Westbury and I know on a weekend night you could be waiting over 1 hour for a table",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=660

Dog poo probably tastes decent when you  batter it, deep fry it twice and then drown the hell out of it in the richest, most decadent sauces. That's pretty much the rundown on your most popular cheesecake items. and boyyyy are they yummy. don't even bother with their lighter fare. the weight management salads? puh lease. they suck. You can get some grilled fish and steamed veg, but if that's what you're looking for drive and extra 5 minutes to legal seafood and get some really good fish. If you came to cheesecake, go big or go home. It sure isn't a fine culinary experience but it's fun. Especially with a group of people and some drinks. their sweet corn tamale cakes and avocado eggrolls are good.  The one thing about this place I will bow down to is their cheesecake menu. Oh sweet heavens. I wouldn't know where to begin as far as making recommendations, and if I started describing them this review would get way too long and may even start sounding pathetic. But i will say, do try their new red velvet cheesecake.

Jennifer T.,"East Elmhurst, NY",28,20,1,5.0,8/5/2012,"I haven't been to cheesecake factory in ages, and I have to say, it was such a good decision to go again. The only negative thing about this place is that they don't take reservations by phone or through the web. So my advice to you is, GET THERE EARLY! I've read some of the negative reviews about the place, and not to bash anyone else, but I do have one thing to say about them. Obviously, if it's so hard to get a table during the 7-8 time slot, then the restaurant is doing something right, especially since people DO stay and wait for 45 min+. So if you're the type of person that doesn't really mind what time they have dinner, just go early and you can beat the rush. Secondly, for people who have said that they're food is too heavy, you might want to try entrees from their ""Skinny"" menu. It has specially made drinks and plates that are smaller and lighter, and lower in calories. Win win all around.  Now onto my actual dining experience. Since I got there EARLY, around 530, we were seated immediately. Our waiter was superb. He was a true gentleman throughout our entire meal. He was courteous, friendly, and made sure that our dining experience was a pleasant one. My friend and I had drinks along with our dinner, and that was probably the only negative thing I have to say. Her cocktail was reasonably priced, but a sangria at 12.50 a glass? That's a bit ridiculous. That's like asking me to pay 20 bucks for a glass of fruit juice with some fruit in it.  We got the smaller sized appetizers which allowed us to get more than one kind of appetizer and we actually still had room for our meal. I got the Cajun pasta, and as my own personal recommendation, get it with spinach instead of the bell peppers that it comes with!  All in all it was a great dining experience and we ended up tipping our waiter 20 on a 90 dollar bill because he was just that fantastic. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=640

I had the accompanying Caesar salad and she had the house salad. We expected small side salads but were shocked by the huge salads we each received. Not only were they oversized but they looked and tasted great as well. The pizzas were a pleasant surprise - thin crust with a delicious marinara sauce with pieces of fresh mozzarella and strips of fresh basil. It was just the right size and a perfect complement to the salads. We both drank water, which the server kept refilled for us. We skipped dessert, especially since calorie counts were prominently displayed on the menu and we had already done serious damage!

She replied when I asked for a new one.  At that point I wanted to bang my head against a wall but maturity prevailed and we decided to pass on the app.  The mains came and were ok.  Standard cheesecake fare.  I get about 3/4 of the way through my beer when i looked into it and saw floating debris.  Lucky me, two things I didn't order for free.  It was most likely shallot or onion that made it through the dishwasher then dried onto the glass, and the beer released them.  I said something to our waitress and she offered what appeared to be an apology.  A manager came over and tried to rectify the situation by telling me the square shaped floaters in my drink came from the tap.  Soooooo, to sum it up, I wish Long Island had the A B C food safety rating that NYC does because this would definitely be a C.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=680

I've never had to wait for a lunch, and dinner has always been less than 30 minutes. Tip: Only get a table upstairs, the downstairs has always been nasty. Food here is par excellence. I love the Eggplant Sandwich and Barbeque Ranch Salad. Pastas look great too. Cheesecake here is absolutely amazing, mass produced, but still delicious.

I would not feed that to my cat.  It was not buffalo chicken it was like mashed up chicken deep fried and served in some bbq sauce, SO GROSS!  So now on to the cheesecake it was really good however after this bratty child gave us an attitude for asking a question she gave my boyfriend what looked like 1/3 the size of my cheese cake slice.  She literally hated him I think, left there asap and will probably never be returning.  And to the cheesecake factory if your reading this try not to hire highschool kids as waiters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=680

My biggest complaint about the restaurant are the portions are just way too huge. I usually don't make food decisions based off of calories, but when I saw that my meal + some of an appetizer + dessert (you gotta get the cheesecake) = more calories than I usually eat in 1 day (over 2,000!!) I was really disgusted. Even if I cut my meal in half and shared the dessert, it was still soooo many calories. I just don't get where they come from. The biggest gold star goes to our waiter, Tommy.

I tried the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls appetizer and it was strangely delicious!!! However, it was pretty expensive. It was 10 dollars for 4 Mac and Cheese Balls. Their main courses are pretty good too and the portions are huge. My friend and I both had chicken dishes that were mediocre. The steak dishes were really good. The burgers are huge with a large side of fries.I had to package my main course home and so did my friends. Then, came dessert. The cheesecake was delicious and the two dollops of whip cream made up like almost the whole slice of cheesecake.

Service is not bad at the table, but disastrous for take-out.  For the amount of money they charge for a slice of cheesecake, I could make my own.  It is good, but I wouldn't go out of my way for, especially considering the calories!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=260

Such a huge selection, there's pages and pages of delicious choices on the menu. The nachos are amazing, and the buffalo blasts are sooo good. Everything I ever tried here was good, never had any complaints about the food. And the cheesecake is to die for. The only downfall of this place is that it's always packed and there is always a wait no matter what day or time, which can be understandable in a way because of what they have to offer. Overall, mostly I've experienced the service to be good, but there were times where it was slow. Parking lot is also terrible.

Jason L.,"Brooklyn, NY",98,218,642,3.0,6/29/2014,Came here for dinner last night. There were a lot of people standing outside the restaurant and inside waiting to be seated. We expected the wait to be long but turned out we only waited for about 3 minutes for a table for 2. Guess those people were waiting for big tables. The menu to this place is very extensive. Always takes me forever to decide on what to eat. We decided to ordered the firecracker salmon for appetizer.  This was amazingly good.  You could taste like the chunks of salmon and when dipped in the chili sauce it was delicious. Fiance had the pear and endive salad which wasn't so good. The lettuce and other vegetables that was in it didn't appear fresh and didn't taste fresh. I had the louisiana chciken pasta. Tasted really good on the initial few bites and then it was a little salty.  The sauce was a little spicy but tasted good when you rub some of that sauce on the parmesan chicken. Decided to try the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake. They always have the most amazing cheesecakes. Service at this place was kind of slow.  Took our waitress forever to bring out our cheesecake but of course the check came so quickly,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=260

This asshole took a good 10 minutes just to show up to my table. I was pissed at this point because my date was practically done with her meal, and i didn't even touch mine. When the manager finally showed up he apologized and ordered another dish. Long story short (or even longer) when my food finally arrived the shit was over cooked again. Fuckin' ridiculous.... I didn't eat the nasty shit, and was still charged full price for the dish.      The only reason I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt is because all the other times I've been here, its been good.

The waiter completely forgot one of our appetizers since he didn't bother writing anything down. My steak Diane was over cooked when I specifically asked for medium. I only tasted black pepper and salt. It was lacking the wine with mushroom sauce flavor as described on the menu. My friend got the grilled salmon and it was so dry he had a hard time eating it. The only thing they didn't screw up was the red velvet cheese cake. The cheese cake was probably the one thing worth wild in the whole restaurant.

The food was the best part for the appetizers we had the fried mac&cheese(MUST TRY) and the fried zucchini sticks. For our main course I had the fish tacos with black beans and rice my mom had the salmon with carrots and my grandma had the shrimp basket. Desert was the best part I had the red velvet cheesecake and my mom had the pumpkin cheesecake. Another thing they did was the waiters sang happy birthday to me because we where celebrating my birthday  but they went a step extra and put a candle on top of the cake which has never been done at any other restaurant I have been to.  Also you will be going home with left overs that's because of the BIG sizes of the plates.

Karen Y.,"College Point, Queens, NY",77,249,65,4.0,8/20/2009,"Mmm...Cheesecake Factory. I wanted to come here for the longest time, but never had an opportunity to do so. I heard stories about how other people waited on line for hours just to get in. My co-worker waited an hour and a half just to be seated for Valentine's Day. In celebration of one of my co-worker's birthdays, we decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory at around 5:30pm weekday. Parking could be moderately difficult since the Cheesecake Factory parking lot is shared with other Source Mall businesses. I tend to park nearer to the end where Dave & Busters is to secure a parking spot. When we arrived, we casually went to the hostess stand to reserve a table. It would be a twenty minute wait, which isn't bad compared to what I expected. When our party was called, we were told to go upstairs. When I arrived to the second floor, there is another hostess at a hostess booth who confirmed our party's arrival. We were seated by our short-haired, skinny female server, who grabbed a bunch of the thickest menus I've ever seen. The six of us sat in a booth. The decor seemed relaxing with low lighting and orange sconces. I am still going crazy over the menu book. It felt like twenty pages, but there were advertisements in some of the pages, which I thought was weird. Aren't I here to eat, not look at advertisements? The menu covered a lot of different dishes from Italian, Mexican, to Thai food. The menu selection is so massive that they boast that there are more than 200 menu selections. The question now is: does quantity affect quality? I'm still drooling from the last time I had Thai food at Sushi Thai Garden  , so I order the Thai chicken pasta which is linguini with sautéed chicken, Julienne carrots, green onion and a spicy peanut sauce topped with fresh bean sprouts. My co-workers ordered two appetizers, which are platter-sized. I think one of them was a Quesadilla platter, grilled flour tortilla filled with melted cheese, green onions, and chile alongside guacamole, salsa and sour cream with chicken. I forget what the other platter was, but I do remember they both tasted good. When my Thai chicken pasta came, my eyes and appetite opened. I love anything with noodles and peanut sauce so needless to say, it was a great meal with moderate spice. I did not end up finishing the whole thing though and had to bag it up in a nice ""Cheesecake Factory"" bag. Then comes the highlight of the event: dessert. Even though I normally don't go for the dessert, who am I kidding? This is the Cheesecake Factory and no way am I skipping out on cheesecake as a first-timer patron. My eyes delightfully narrowed down to the fresh strawberry. I imagined that it was cheesecake and strawberries swirled in together, creating what I imagine perfect harmony. To my slight disappointment, the strawberry cheesecake in front of me is actually a regular piece of cheesecake with some fresh strawberries and strawberry syrup spread on top with fancy balls of creme on the sides. I'll still eat it though, who am I kidding? Actually, I'm normally not a huge fan of cheesecake that much, but I'm willing to be excited for the cheesecake here. It was good and I think I dropped down about $40 in total including a portion to chip in for my co-worker's birthday meal. The waitress was nice enough to take our group picture. It didn't come out as well as I thought it would be since the flash wasn't that good, but she made the effort. What was a little bothersome was that she failed to bring us proper silverware for our desserts. We all had desserts, but no spoons. Instead of waiting continually for her to show up, we flagged down the busboys and they brought us the silverware instead. Actually, while our waitress was nice and brought us the birthday upside-down cheesecake for my co-worker, our waitress wasn't really around to check up on us to see if we needed anything. Yes, cheesecake factory is a busy place, but there's no reason to skip on the service. I had a good time here though and will see if fate will give me an opportunity to go back and try the Cheesecake Factory again. PROS: incredibly vast menu selection, delicious cheesecakes CONS: pricey, servers not available at times",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=740
Ben C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,156,,4.0,12/22/2009,"If you're on a diet don't bother coming here.  Now, if you have an appetite (and patience..the wait for anything..seating..food..an extra fork..is long), you'll probably take a liking to this place. I'm not going to be a food snob here and look down on The Cheesecake Factory just because it's a chain. This is one of my favorite chains because of the hearty entrees, satisfying appetizers, and great, huge portions of cheesecake slices. My favorites are the Tex Mex Rolls, Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, Cobb Salad, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (although I can do without the chicken and just have the shrimp), and Oreo cheesecake to take home and eat for dessert (because my friends and I are always too stuffed to eat it at the restaurant).  The downsides pretty much have to do with the size of the place: it is huge and it's very hard to flag down your waiter/waitress. The menu is extensive so it's hard to decide what to get and of course with a large menu, there's always the risk of something not being made well. It's no fine dining, but it's a nice time when all you want is to eat a heavy dinner and chat with some friends. I no longer live out in Queens (it was less than a 25 minute drive) but if I'm ever around Roosevelt Mall, I always try to return to The Cheesecake Factory. I've also been to the one near Topanga Mall in Cali and it was the same, dependable dishes, only I believe that one was just set up differently.

Marie T.,"New York, NY",1,23,2,1.0,1/19/2014,"Where to start? Well, after waiting an hour for a table. We attempted to order our dinners. My husband requested no mushrooms on his burger, the waitress said they cannot do that. Ok, weird, but ok. Next item he tried to order they were out of. Ok, strike 2. Finally got our food. I noticed mine was only warm, not hot. After taking a forkful of mashed potatoes I found a piece of ""mystery meat"" inside the potatos. I took it out and cut into it to see what it was. It was not from my entree and had the consistancy of styrofoam. I sent it back, at this point frustrated after waiting so long for such a horrible experience. Just one more reason I will probably never eat at a chain resturaunt again. What a waste of a Saturday evening. We also noticed 2 other tables sending food back. I cannot understand how it was so packed! Oh and to top it off, the manager or whoever came over to me after the whole ordeal, apologized and then asked if I wasn't mistaken, that maybe it was a root!! A ROOT??? The idea of a large chunk of meat being mistaken as some sort of root is completely ridiculous. If they have roots growing out of their potatoes, there is a serious problem going on there. Either this guy thinks I am a complete idiot, or he is not too bright.  I told him to go in the kitchen, find my plate and take a look for himself. I don't even know how he had the gall to question me without seeing it with his own 2 eyes. Unreal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=740

Gary L.,"Woodside, NY",1076,1124,4993,4.0,12/7/2011,"I don't come to Cheesecake Factory often but when I do, I really enjoy pigging out on their ridiculous 1,000 plus calorie meals. Food - Although a lot of the items on their menu are really unhealthy, it's hard to resist. Caught the itis instantaneously during the drive back home. For appetizers, we had their fried calamari. It was pretty excellent. It was nice and crispy and the sauces were pretty bangin too. For my entree, I had to try out the Macaroni and Cheeseburger w/ sweet potato fries simply because of all the articles I've read about it being one of the most unhealthiest burgers you can possibly have. The Macaroni and Cheeseburger tasted really good. It didn't taste too unhealthy. My friend ordered the Blue Cheese B.L.T. and his burger was leaking grease non-stop. My other friend had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. It was terrible. I wouldn't recommended it. It's literally drenched in oil. She took a few bites and called it quits. I decided to bag it up and have it later. When I got home, the entire bag was filled with oil and grease. As for dessert, we had their Tiramisu Cheesecake. It was pretty great. Service - We went on a Sunday afternoon for Lunch. It was kinda busy. The service was okay. Our waitress took a little long with our beverages but other than that, everything was A-OK. Verdict - If you're in the area or hungry after shopping at Roosevelt Field Mall and in a mood to pig out, Cheesecake Factory would be one of my choices. There is one thing I really disliked about this particular Cheesecake Factory which is their restroom. This Cheesecake Factory has two floors and most of the dining tables are on the 2nd level and they only have one restroom which is in the back of the 1st level. It's not very convenient.

David G.,"New York, NY",15,71,1,4.0,11/28/2012,"i eat out... alot.  so ive finally decided to be one of those demanding customers as im tired of spending 100bucks and not getting great service or the table i want etc.   so, i go to high end places, chains, diners and dives (if theyre great)... houstons and cpk are my favorite chains but i like the atmosphere at cheesecake too and the value (typically i have enough leftovers for another meal the next day).   went to this CF again a week or so ago.  i really dont want to get anyone in trouble so im gonna leave out the really bad specific details, but lets just say our first server was so annoying and unprofessional (talking about their personal life, without solicitation, even touched my friend at one point).... that we left.  well, we left their section, went back to the host stand and asked for a table, specifically requesting the opposite side of the restaurant.  i go out to eat to escape and feel like im on a mini vacation, not to be brought back down to reality due to crappy service etc.  new table...... night and day.  our server Ivana was effecient, friendly (in a professional way), cheerful, well spoken, informed, etc etc etc. A+  i.e. great server. thank you!  i have to also mention 'Paul'(?), the waiter at the next table to ours was also phenomenal, i was shocked by how good he was, hearing him interact with those guests was very very impressive. just amazing.  I hope he is recognized by mgmt.   and of course the famous busser, i have seen him there a few times, im sure mgmt knows how good that guy is, the guy who methodically and rapidly re sets tables and scans the room, what an asset.   on another small negative, the bussers in our section seemed half asleep, repeatedly walking by empty glasses and plates on our table, to the point i had to ask one of them to please take them away when he was about to wander past us again for the 5th time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=600

THERE IS ALWAYS A WAIT!!! that being said i seriously doubt anyone has a gun to your head forcing you to eat here. you don't like to wait,,,burger king has a drive thru. Its one of the last remaining stores still operating in the joke of a mall The Source. Yes the menu is HUGE,,,,they do a variety of cuisine's,,,some work some don't. Im a big fan of the Roadside sliders and the corn fritters. I like when my server engages me in conversation and doesn't just look at me like a dollar sign. Again you don't enjoy friendly waiters,,,,go to a diner. The managers are all professional and the staff are as well. I also like getting my money's worth. the portions here are huge so i like being able to share a dish wish someone and not spend a paycheck on a pasta dish that would leave a toddler hungry. Don't even get me started on the desserts here,,,,that place is responsible for my current love of yoga pants and i don't do yoga. The limoncello cream torte is my fav and you really can't find any of the cheesecakes that aren't amazing. Don't buy into the negative nancy's on here that seem to enjoy complaining about every petty thing and go,,,get a pager,,,,bring a book, kindle, Ipad whatever it takes and get ready to chow down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=600
'Rilla D.,"New York, NY",4,30,,5.0,1/18/2011,"Honestly anyone who's been here before & still complains about the wait is crazy. Yeah, there's usually ALWAYS a wait. Especially since the downstairs is rarely open anymore. But everyone knows that. Anyone who comes here & complains about how large the portions are or how many calories are in the meals is also crazy. If you're concerned about that, you probably shouldn't be going to a place called The Cheesecake Factory. Just sayin'... The cheesecake is insane. Of course it is, that's what they're known for. But it's not just that, the fried macaroni & cheese, taquitos, corn fritters & nachos are insane. The salads are HUGE. Every meal me or anyone I know has ever had has been perfect. The waiters & waitresses for the most part are friendly, helpful, attentive and awesome (most of them taking even large orders without writing them down...how do they do that?!). Never had a bad meal, mistaken order or anything missing. Last time I came here was before Christmas and they ran out of Peppermint Bark cheesecake and I am so sad about it, I almost took away a star.

Billy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,370,3,5.0,1/6/2011,"I have to give CF 5 stars here for the simple fact I needed to be in and out in an hour to catch True Grit at UA Westbury and they did so with some minutes to spare. Dining alone, I kind of felt like Peter from Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but the staff was very friendly and the hostess even stayed at my table a bit to chat. Plus, dining alone gives you the option of eating whatever you want without someone judging you and if they are judging me because of all the food I got, my resolution is to be a fat American and live up to my stereotype. I went with the sweet corn tamale cakes which are always a great appetizer and can serve as meal. I chose to follow up with The Navajo Sandwich which is a chicken, lettuce, tomato, onion, and spicy mayo creation on warm fry bread. I haven't been able to find a sandwich like this anywhere else and it's an awesome, healthier option for those who are counting calories. Speaking of, CF started listing calories on the menu for items and also offers a healthy menu supplement, which probably goes against the clientele because people are going to a place called CHEESECAKE FACTORY!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=600

I've heard stories of people waiting 3 hours to eat here, which I can't really understand. Upon opening the menu I saw an ad featuring Keith Hernandez advertising a cash for gold service...that's nice, but I was trying to find the appetizers. We setlled on the avocado spring rolls which were very good. For an entree we had the miso glazed salmon which was also very good and a chicken and shrimp pasta dish that was average at best. Now, I know this place is known for its desserts but both the pineapple and reese's cheesecakes tasted like they just came out of the freezer. Almost like a high quality sara lee cheesecake that grandma takes out the last minute when she wasn't expecting company. Very average.  $72 for the two of us...would I come back here again?

Lee M.,"New York, NY",49,270,5,3.0,10/18/2010,"I suppose I have been going to my share of chain restaurants recently.  Came here on a Saturday evening after a movie - around 10:15pm, and it's amazing how crowded this place still is.  What's even more unbelievable are the amount of small children that are brought here for dinner after 11pm?!?   Now that the caloric contents of each item on the menu is posted, it makes dining here virtually impossible.  I can't in good conscience put down the bistro shrimp pasta for north of 2800 calories.  Even something that you think would be healthy, like the miso salmon has 1700 calories.  As such, I ordered the herb crusted salmon salad and my wife had the vietnamese summer rolls, two of the few options below 1000 calories on the menu.  I believe the salmon was poached - it's served cold.  Either way, it was cooked nicely, and came with asparagus, endive and mixed greens.  Overall, I was pretty happy.  As for the summer rolls, they're pretty decent too.  I do have a tough time looking past the cilantro but there are nice pieces of shrimp in there.    We shared a piece of the carrot cake cheesecake, which was fantastic.  Rich cream cheese icing, cheesecake and carrot cake all in one - you can't go wrong.  All in, with tax and tip, the bill was around $50.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=600

Dee F.,"Plainview, NY",0,49,7,4.0,8/27/2013,The reason why i only give it four stars is because when me and my boyfriend came here it was 9 o'clock around. They sat us downstairs which we were fine with. Then the waitress proceeded to politely rush us because the kitchen was going to close... i thought you closed at midnight? Then we learned the DOWNSTAIRS closes early..... why sit us downstairs if we are  going to be rushed? poor judgement of the hostess in my opinion... The decor and the food was delicious and is definitely enough to share. However everything on the menu looks so good its hard to choose. I got the vegitable burger which was delicious and my boyfriend got the chicken and biscuits which was very good as well! We also got the mac and cheese balls as an appetizer which were more cheese less macaroni which were served very decoratively.Would definitely go back again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=600

Prices are reasonable, the menu selection is varied (the menu is so long they found room for advertisements), and the atmosphere is comfortable.

Kim W.,"New York, NY",19,240,31,4.0,6/3/2010,"I love cheesecake factory but they lose one star b/c wait times are always super long.  There is a reason for the super long wait and that's b/c their dishes are really awesome.  If you truly don't want to wait for 1.5+ hours, then come on a weekday or come on off times when the crowd isn't so large.  I guarantee you'll like it.  My favorite dish is the farfelle with chicken and roasted garlic.  I recently went back and decided to try something new.  My new found favorite is the shrimp pasta special & the warm crab & artichoke dip as an appetizer.  The pasta dish had white wine with lemon and capers and chicken.  It was really delicious and it tasted like they tossed the pasta with cheese.  The warm crab & artichoke dip was creamy and a little tuna-ish but it was still really good.  I'm not a big cheesecake lover but the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is the only cheesecake I'll eat. :)  They make an awesome lava flow too.  If you're unsure what to get b/c the menu's so large, don't be scared to ask your waiter.  They'll definitely point you in the right direction.  Man, I'm hungry just thinking about their food! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-westbury?start=760

True, the prices are pretty steep which accounts for the star missing in the rating......this sandwich, for example, might run you 9-10 dollars plus tax and tip, but I think it's worth it.

M K.,"Bayside, NY",0,31,,3.0,1/25/2010,"Let me preface my review with the following disclaimer  - I always rate places on a relative scale. For example, giving Cheesecake factory a 3 star rating does NOT mean I think it is a 3 star establishment on a global scale. It means that I consider it a 3 star restaurant as compared to other restaurants in its category. Okay, not that that's clear....We waited over an hour and a half for a table on a Saturday night, which is long, but I don't mind waiting most nights. It's good time to catch up with friends over drinks and it creates anticipation for the meal that's coming. So we finally sat down and ordered some drinks and the appetizer sampler. When the apps came, I dove right into the guac and chips and was not disappointed. Yummy, it's pretty hard to mess with guac and chips. Then I moved on the next item and although I was not sure what it was, tasted it. Hmm, interesting. Sweet and savory at once. Some kind of asian inspired flavor. Hey, does anyone at the table know what this is? Blank stares.  Shrug. Okay, let's move on to item #3. Hmmm, almost the same as item 2. Does anyone know what this is? Again, shrugs and deer-in-headlight stares. Have we had too many Stellas? What the heck is going on here? Everything on the app plate looked different, tasted eerily the same and no one could identify any of it. Thankfully, the main courses were actually identifiable and tasted much better. I sampled hubby's burger and it was yummy. My own dish (Steak Diane with shrimp in basil sauce) was pretty good too. The basil sauce was great. Dessert was predictable, but good. All in all, an okay night with some pretty decent food. Would I frequent this place? No way. Maybe once or twice a year. There are too many better places out there.
