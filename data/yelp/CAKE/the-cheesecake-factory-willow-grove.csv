Mike H.,"Philadelphia, PA",22,77,53,4.0,10/3/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a place to go when you are throwing all caution to the wind about your diet ... or so I thought! I didn't want an insanely thick dinner+dessert so I opted to pick from their low-calorie menu for dinner, known as the Skinnylicious menu. I'm not going to lie, I really dislike that name - I felt really silly ordering the Skinnylicious shrimp tacos. But I was surprised at the plate when it came out, I was expecting dinky little taco shells with maybe a single shrimp in each to help keep the calories low But I was pleasantly surprised at the portion size.  Generally, the food itself was fine. Nothing bad, just nothing to write home about. The tacos were a little bland. And I've noticed that as well with other meals I've had at various Cheesecake Factory locations too, not necessarily specific to this location. I've never had a bad meal there, I just feel like in a restaurant where most everything is on its A-game, the entrees are just okay.  I got the low carb Cheesecake with strawberries. This more than makes any meal there worth it, and is what keeps us going back. It was unbelievably tasty and rich. My wife got the celebration cheesecake which had some birthday cake baked into it. We of course shared, and both were top notch.  Also, top marks go to our server Lexi. She was great. She handled her job well, but was definitely keeping us laughing and smiling every time she stopped by to check in on us. She should be commended for her great attitude and sense of humor. Whenever we go back, we will hope to be served by her every time we go.  A fun little observation: some of the decor in there reminds me of the Eye Of Sauron from the Lord Of The Rings movies. I always enjoy that each time I go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove
Lisa M.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,8,1,1.0,12/12/2017,"Before I write this review, I just wanted to say that I tried to address this matter over the Cheesecake factory website but they never responded or addressed a major concern I had over my experience. I went to the Cheesecake factory on Tuesday, December 5th around 7pm. Even though it was busy, we were promptly seated at a table, no complaints there. We ordered the appetizer and it was pretty delicious (chicken samosas). Service was very slow and eventually my entree (fish and chips) finally came out. It tasted pretty good but in one of the bites I took of the battered fish, I thought I had a ""bone"" in my mouth. It was very hard and impossible to chew, and upon removing the ""bone"" from my mouth I actually saw that it was a shiny piece of metal *drum roll here*.. A STAPLE. That is right, somehow a staple ended up in my fish. I promptly told the waitress that I wouldn't be eating this any further because of my concern that possibly another staple could be in my food. I really wish I was making up this story because literally my whole night was ruined. The waitress took it away and said that my meal and any dessert I chose would be on the house. She also offered me another meal, however I declined. She said it could have been a piece of metal from the frying bin? LIKE WHY IS THE FRYING BIN FALLING APART? HOW IS THAT OK? SO there we have it, my awful experience at the Cheesecake factory. If you go, be careful and weary.  This definitely raised a huge red flag for me. I don't like to question the integrity and safety of my food so I most likely won't be returning to any of the locations.   On a side note, I had a friend that was served glass in his water at another location.  Cheers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove
Elliot P.,"Philadelphia, PA",182,232,6,2.0,9/18/2017,"TCF is usually my favorite chain restaurant. But my recent experience at TCF Willow Grove was a bit...lacking. The wait wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I think their whole refusal to take reservations is a bit ridiculous, mostly because it really inhibits the ability to plan a nice evening out. Anyway, it was a bit dirty inside. We had to request the table to be wiped down. There was an odd stale smell in the air too.  Usually the bread just comes, but we were asked if we wanted it - which I thought was odd. I'm used to it just being there. We order a couple of appetizers and our meals. Then I ordered an apple cider. I got an apple juice and i was like hey I wanted a cider and our waiter was like ok that's what we call our apple juice. Nice try. Is this my first time ordering an apple cider? Am I an 8 year old? We eat the rest of the meal. It was delicious. The kitchen never disappoints. My MIL (who has quite discerning taste) was impressed.  Then the bill came and the apple juice was on it. Note it was called ""juice"" on the bill not ""cider"". Oh and speaking of the bill, they put misleading tip percentages on the bill. They are supposed to base the tip on the pre-tax amount, but they base it on the post tax amount. Shady. They took off the juice and claimed it was an accident that it was still on it in the first place. Shady. I had the celebration cheesecake. I wouldn't get it again. Should have went with the 30th anniversary one instead. Oh and they need to bring back the Navajo and the apple pie cheescake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove

I had a bug in my cheesecake and when I called to complain the Manager Lakeisha I think she said her  name was had a cavalier attitude about it  Update... 1/12/18 (late update)  1. I did get in contact with a representative from corporate after they read my review He was very helpful and even compensated me for my trouble  with a $25 gift card I was able to get into more detail about my experience .

MarkAnd S.,"Northeast Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA",138,14,36,4.0,1/8/2018,Cheese cake was really good! They have a wide variety of options and they have a skinny licious menu as well.

Ashley Y.,"Bensalem, PA",28,85,183,4.0,11/16/2017,Came for a birthday brunch for my dad. We all had their lunch specials. The lunch specials are until 5pm everyday which is awesome.

Johnny L.,"Marietta, GA",71,70,137,4.0,9/26/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a great family restaurant and I haven't really ever had a bad experience at this chain. So most Cheesecake Factory restaurants all have pretty much the same decor and the menu is pretty standard. So my wife and I decided to come in this past weekend and as usual the service and food was excellent. We ended up ordering off the skinny menu for my wife and I are both trying to watch what we eat and ended up getting the filet steak and the chicken pasta which were both great and shared the artichoke crab dip which I must say was good but a lot smaller than I remembered. Anyhow we also ended up getting the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae which was great as well. Overall this location is usually packed, however it's service and food is the classic Cheesecake Factory signature service and quality. I had no complaints and look forward to coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove
Lindsey D.,"Enfield, CT",272,46,13,3.0,11/24/2017,Always great service and extensive menu. Menu is labeled if an item has gluten in it. I love their Cobb salad! Very accommodating of my gluten allergy but they do not have gluten free bread but serve regular bread on the table before food comes - this has happened to me about 3 times now.

The hostess was friendly but seemed confused and disorganized. We were sat within ten minutes of arriving. Our server was polite, funny, patient, and knew his stuff. Our drinks were always filled and our appetizers and main course arrived in a timely manner.  The food was average, very large quantity - enough for lunch, dinner, and tomorrow's lunch, but not high quality for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove

I didn't get a single leaf of spinach, not one blueberry, and almonds were no where to be found. I did find a stray pear or grape here and there, but this salad (prepared at the Willow Grove location) was mostly a pile of ""salad greens"".  Oh wait. And one tiny morsel of broccoli.

Bob H.,"Byberry, Philadelphia, PA",50,446,527,1.0,4/13/2017,"Absolutely terrible tonight! We arrived around 4:30 after doing some shopping. We waited about 10-15 minutes which isn't bad for this place. It tends to get very crowded. We were sat just outside the main restaurant. When we being sat the table was still dirty from the previous guests. It was also very loud and very cold in that section. We ordered drinks and dinner at the same time. We waited a bit for the server to greet us. This was by far the worst service we've had in a long time. The girl didn't tell us her name, she was very flat and unenthusiastic to say the least. Our daughter ordered an orange juice, literally took 25 minutes to get it. We had to ask twice, we were told it's fresh squeezed so it takes a while. We had TJ ask for bread, didn't receive lemons in water or tea (we did ask). Worst of all was the wait time for food. With no exaggeration it took an hour for our food. Tables that were sat after us were eating before us. I understand a restaurant can get busy and things happen. The main issue is the server made no attempt to inform us as to what was going on. She was honestly one of the worst servers we've ever had. She didn't seem to care a bit. The manager did bring our food out personally and apologized. She then came over again after the meal and asked how everything was. The food was good but there is no reason for 2 entrees to take an hour. She offered us free dessert and we declined. She then took of one of our meals. It was a nice gesture but it was too late. We left very unhappy. Not sure if we will return. 1 star",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove
Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, MD",29,188,220,1.0,10/3/2017,"Ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which is what I usually get. It is a little spicy but this time it was so spicy I had to send it back.

First of all it was missing the sauce that it usually comes with which I believe makes the whole dish. Second the meat was t uff and didn't have any flavor to it.

Sari Marissa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",1625,945,7763,4.0,9/21/2016,"3.5 stars Chain restaurants are my least favorite places to dine. This particular chain however does offer a lot of variety so for that, I like it. The menu, as many of you know is absolutely huge and extensive. There is something for everyone... the health-conscious and the ones who want to splurge on big giant piece of nine dollar cheesecake alike. There are also gluten-free and dairy free items clearly marked. I do love Ana greatly appreciate that all menu items are listed with their calorie content and have been way before it was trendy. I also like the option to get a lunch sized portion of any of their dinner entrees.  I've been to three different locations, center city, KOP and this one. This location is OK. They all pretty much look the same with that somewhat Tuscan decor and all locations are pretty large. I have personally never had to wait here, but I usually come during the day, during the week.  This spot makes for a good stop mid shopping spree and I think that the area and the mall alike needed something like. This Cheesecake Factory is a good option if you're looking for a sit-down meal rather than takeout from the food court while here at Willow Grove. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but for a mall day, it's a good option.  I've never had a bad meal here. My go to lately is the vegan Cobb. It's huge and tasty. It can easily be made into two meals or split amongst the entire table. Try it! Crispy and crunchy! Prices are fair, portions are hearty and service here has been pretty good each time we have visited. If you're starving fear not, they start you with delicious warm bread and creamy house butter right away!  Be a good wife and grab a slice of decadent, rich cheesecake for hubs so he won't mind how much you spent that day :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove

Maria L.,"Ambler, PA",4,17,13,4.0,11/20/2017,"We went to this restaurant on a Friday night. Of course busy. We waited for about an hour before we were seated.  We met our waitress and she introduced herself. We ordered our appetizers , food and drinks at that time we were starving.  Our buffalo blast did not arrive until about an 1 hr.    And when they did arrive - the waitress immediately  came over to apologize.  She said she spoke with her manager and mentioned that we waited a long time for our appetizers. She came and sat beside me which i did appreciate. Since we waited so long, the manager said we could take the appetizers off the bill or 2 cheese cake desserts.   We chose the desserts. Our dinner did arrived shortly after.  Presentation of our food was good and the food tasted delicious.  I did order a margarita. The taste was good but sadly the glass was small and with the ice- there was not much to drink.  Once we were done - we asked for the check- and our waitress said ther the buffalo blast were taken off the bill.   It was a win win for us. Thank you cheese cake factory for being aware of your customers  I will cont to go to this restaurant.

It has yet to fail me.  My favorite is the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Amazing! The portions are huge, but I still finish it. I usually don't have room for cheesecake, but... I get it anyways.

April H.,"Warrington, PA",33,112,580,3.0,7/22/2016,"The decor is fun, the place is large (and loud), and the food is decent for a chain restaurant. I do not like how they pack you in like sardines at the 2 and 4 top tables. The menu is huge and somewhat overwhelming. There is a separate ""skinnylicious"" menu if you are looking for the healthier options.  There are some fabulous looking salads and, of course, an insane dessert selection, but I opted for the grilled fish tacos this time. The corn tortillas were nicely grilled and filled with slaw, grilled fish, pico de gallo and fresh avocado. The dish was accompanied by lime cilantro rice and black beans. The rice and beans were both tasty, but the rice was a bit greasy. My daughter got a chicken Caesar salad and shrimp scampi minus tomatoes. The salad was good. The dressing is garlicky but not bad for bottled Caesar. The shrimp in the scampi dish was breaded and the sauce creamy, which are atypical of traditional scampi. It was also very garlicky. Portions are huge!! I liked that the server asked if there were any food allergies (apparently they change gloves if so). I also enjoyed watching the screen with all the photos of the dishes, so I could narrow it down for next time :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=20

The proverbial icing on the cake (no pun intended) was that Rebecca actually let us split the check.

I ordered the Macaroni and Cheese burger. My mom ordered the Steak Diane, and my brother ordered the fish tacos. We always underestimate the portion size of the food.

Dar B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,16,32,2.0,4/15/2017,"EDIT: took a star off after our last experience. Saturday is understandingly busy but tonight was outrageous. The people who run this location need more training. My date and I were escorted to a table that was already full of people and we just stood there like deer in headlights.. went back to the hostess desk and no one knew what was going on or what table was actually clear or not. Eventually they found a table for us. But that's where hell began. Why would anyone seat a quiet couple shoved in a corner next to the most obnoxious group of college freshmen laughing screaming the entire time...   can't speak for the food because I packed it to go to finish it at home in peace and quiet. And then lost my appetite all together... awful experience. No apology from the server.  I have ""Duchess"" status at this particular location so I've been here MANY times and for the most part the food is excellent. Tonight's experience This time we were seated in the area outside the restaurant, and I don't mean the outdoor seating. But the tables that line the entrance to the mall. Yes, we were seated by the mall doors. To say this was insulting does not even begin to describe it. If I wanted to sit in a food court while listen to screaming children and other people running out of the mall shaking the ground I would have went there to eat. Instead I came to the Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night for a restaurant experience.

The ambiance is always nice and the smell is pleasant. I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp. I at every single bit the flavor was amazing. I did not like the black beans so much but the shrimp,chicken and that tasty mango salsa  all disappeared lol.  The Georgia peach is my favorite drink there. It's a pretty fruity frozen drink. Very tasty if I must say so myself.  I've been to the Cheesecake Factory on many occasions and I think I've actually had a cheesecake twice. They are good and really big. Two people could share one. There are so many to choose from.  Takeaways: the wait for a table is always super long. The bar area is open seating but it is usually always full but you can order the full menu there. The menu is way to long. It such a large variety of food and the menu is about 10 pages it sometimes takes me a while to order.

Pourio L.,"Palo Alto, CA",29,527,37,2.0,3/11/2016,"Ok, I've never really been a fan of Cheesecake Factory (food is too salty while at the same time too bland, too greasy, etc.) and yet their cheesecake is not bad. Not amazing, but not bad either. Service is just ok. If you're looking to come here, you're either in high school looking for a nicer atmosphered place to take your date other than your local McD's or a family that wants to take their high school kids to someplace ""nice"" and keep the bill smaller based on how much they eat because the food servings here are healthy at best. I came here since my cousin (who's in high school) begged me to take him here so that he could try it out. I warned him about getting diarrhea and the food quality but he still wanted to go. After $50 (I didn't eat anything) and not finishing the food I paid for, he got diarrhea on the way home. Served him right for not listening to me. So, in short, unless your stomach is made out of steel, your taste buds are numb to salt and your heart can take an extra hard beating of fat, then by all means, come here. Otherwise, you might want to spend that money on something healthier or homemade.

After two minute or so, she came back with no drinks asking if we were ready to order. We were ready since we waited for so long. She took the order, didn't repeat back which caused her to make mistake. She forgot one of our two appetizer and when we asked her, she said ""oh i checked and it wasn't in. I don't know if i didn't hear you say it or if you forgot to say it. Sorry. You guys want it now?""  It sounded like she was blaming us for not ordering it and we weren't unhappy because the food already took long time to come out and wasn't tasty.

Gina Z.,"Willow Grove, PA",6,21,2,1.0,8/1/2017,"I do like the food here ...but one star because of poor management / service. I went yesterday for the National cheesecake day  ""1/2 price sale"". What a mess! The cheesecake is costly at $9.00 a slice so to get it at $4.50 ( closer to an average price ...is great) I went late around 9 pm thinking the line would be over- no luck. The cashier rang me up in about 15 minutes- I thought ok 15-20 min is about how long I thought it would take- WRONG! I was there 50 min in total. There is no reason for this. They KNEW they are having a sale and should have been ready, How hard is it to cut a piece of cake and put it in a bag? I've worked customer service and this could have been avoided- there was ONE cashier and several other workers and still they took close to an hour to serve a piece of cake? Why didn't they prep the job? 1 day before the sale- you cut up several of each kind of cheesecake put it in plastic ""to go containers "" and put them back in a circle with the flavor tag and store them in the case behind the cashier which has tons of room. You have the managers and hourly employees come in early the two days in a row to get the cakes set up- and stay late if needed and you assign a person or two to just cut and pack  on those 2 days. On top of it all the manager? behind the counter who was reading the slips and packing did not seem to follow the correct order as people after me left before me with their food WTH?! A simple way to keep order would be to number the slips 1-20 in a black sharpie when 20 is gone start again at one. They ran out of some flavors and I can understand that. But this was just so unorganized. There is no reason to wait 50 min for 2 slices of cheesecake. I could give them a ton of ways this could have been done correctly oh and it looked like there were lots of servers waiting to also get cake for the dine in customers. Are you telling me your servers can't just put a slice of cake on a plate and go--- Good Grief! Also the music was so loud it was hard to hear the names and dishes were clanging all over the place. It's a shame as I enjoy the food but figured it was too long to wait for a table and service and thought a late night treat would be fun. However I could have worked an hour overtime and paid for a whole meal with the time I wasted waiting for a take out piece of cake :( I see a lot of unhappy reviews on  here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=20

David W.,"Philadelphia, PA",54,198,624,2.0,7/1/2016,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory location. Very convenient for shopping at the Willow Grove Mall, but if I were in the Mall, I'd probably opt for one of the other places in the food court. Our server, Amanda, was great. Very attentive and friendly. Arriving in the early afternoon, we were seated immediately in the patio, at our request. Because of the brutal Mall landscaping (""keep it visible, and they will come""), there are of course no trees around the Mall. Ironic, given the history of Willow Grove Park. So the table umbrellas provide limited shade, and the metal table top - oh my, they can get hot in the sun. We had to move to another table where some shade was available, and Amanda nicely facilitated that. But my complaint is with the restaurant's pricing. For example, I thought the $3.00 coffee was not a good value for the quality, not that it was bad - but it wasn't really great either. The same applies to the other items we ordered. The Caesar Salad with chicken ($17) was very large, but reportedly had really dry chicken. The kids Mac n Cheese ($7) gives you a sense of the pricing range. Pricey - about 25% above comparable dining experiences, but without any distinguishing qualities justifying the pricing. There is an extensive menu, and the interior decoration of the restaurant itself looked spectacular, in a kind of touristy way, if you go for that sort of thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=40

My burger topped with fontina cheese and Caramelized onions and mushrooms was cooked medium as requested but it was dry too. No burger juice! The side salad was fresh and properly dressed. My moms spicy chili salmon was good all around, maybe a bit too much cabbage on the side but otherwise very good.

Before I was a vegetarian, I really enjoyed the CF.  The chicken and dumplings were de-licious.  Last night my friend and I were meeting at a local Vietnamese restaurant, but they happened to be closed for the Chinese New Year (sad face).  So we opted to go here instead.  I thought to myself 'I just saw someone on youtube raving about their veggie burger - I have to try it!!' No.  No, no, no.  It was not de-licious.  It was probably the worst veggie burger I've had.  I'm not sure why restaurants feel like people who don't eat meat want a mushed together patty of rice and some other vegetables I couldn't even tell you were in their based on taste.  That doesn't replicate a burger at all.  I sadly would have been happier going to Red Robin.  So there's the lesson you can take away from this review - if you are a veghead and want a burger you are going to enjoy - skip the Cheesecake Factory and head directly to the nearest Red Robin and order their Boca burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=40

The saving grace was that the food was good, well seasoned, carefully presented. This time service was typical, typically bad. OK, not unexpected. The food was warm, always a plus, I've been served ice cold frozen food at a restaurant before. But that's food prep basics. I ordered fish and chips.  The pros: the fish and fries were crispy and warm. The cons: Salty, greasy, yet magically flavorless. Cole slaw was not cold. It was julienned veggies that weren't even properly cut. No acid in the slaw at all. Tasted like it was tossed in mayo, no salt, no vinegar, no citrus, just mayo. I tried one of my kid's chicken strip. A more appropriate name would have been deep fried chicken jerky. Salty and nasty. Maybe the person in charge of the Fryolater was having a horrid day.

Peter N.,"Willow Grove, PA",125,207,1116,3.0,9/23/2014,"I like the Cheesecake Factory - large menu, big space, and pretty big portions. Growing up, I used to think it was the best restaurant ever.  2 hour wait? Sure ill stand by. But those times have changed.  The above are all still true, but man, it is pricey.  Now that I've gone out and tasted the world, I recognized that the Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that is trying to charge fine dining prices.  $13 for a burrito?? No thanks.  I still thoroughly enjoy their Cobb salad, my go to entree.  Portion is huge and the dispersement of dressing is perfect.  Their lunch specials are a pretty good deal as well and a decent size.   My wife got a vegetable pasta for $15 and wow. It's literally just thin spaghetti, creamy garlic sauce, and a few vegetables.  Pretty overpriced.  She ordered it without Parmesan, but it was brought out with it.  She already took a bite. Waitress said she'll have another sent out and we kept the cheesy one.  We ultimately were charged for both, but it doesn't matter - we did eat them both (shared amongst table). As for appetizers, the avocado eggs rolls are a must -  I have never seen this anywhere else.  6 halves for $12 is a bit steep, but worth it. The wait staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  Came back numerous times to check on the table.  So that is definitely a plus. I go here regularly because I really do enjoy the salad, staff and convenience.  But forget about a Friday/Saturday night - the wait can be long.  I'd recommend this place for casual or even group dining, which is the only time I really go.  Decent food, but not spectacular.

When I asked the hostess about it, she told me I was wrong and that we would be called when its our turn. The service was very unprofessional and the prices were outrageous for the portion size and the quality of food. You can tell everything is pre made, nothing fresh and probably nothing prepared on premise. The cheesecake was a small portion, and especially for almost 8 dollars, I want my money's worth.  The drink menu was  overpriced, and there were no prices on the actual cocktail section I actually had to ask my server, who didn't even have a clue. The food was soggy and had way too much sodium in it. The bread that was served to us was hard as a rock, and I actually CUT the top of my mouths' gum open trying to eat it, it was that hard.

We were in a party of 11, and either the restaurant or our specific server didn't use seating numbers when entering in the order, so that they had to ""raffle off"" the food when it came.

Ravindran C.,"Willow Grove, PA",3,29,7,4.0,5/15/2016,"Well.. the first thing is - for whatever rhyme or reasons, this turns out to be a hangout spot whenever my friends come visiting in to my place. And so far, it has not been a disappointing experience any time. This place is pretty crowded for the most part of the time - regardless of the day of the week you walk into. And the not so nice part is that they don't take in reservations. So, you are definitely getting a raw deal if you are not able to plan much for a free form dining. The ambience of the place in itself is pretty good - and also, appears to be kind of standardized all over. I have not seen a different ambience at different Cheesecake factory outlets so far. As for the parking - you definitely get the parking space from the mall :) You do have a deal of outdoor dining in an explicit fashion for the summers and there is also an ""outdoosy"" feel from the mini out door setup within the mall side of the area that is OUTSIDE of the restaurant area itself :D   Moving out to the food portion of it - I must admit that though I have been here multiple times with multiple people, I haven't quite tried a lot of stuff myself. So, some of the review here should be a combination of what I have eaten plus what my friends had along with me. The freshly squeezed orange juice - it is a class apart. You don't get to have automatic refills. But I can safely bet you would only be asking for more when you have a sip of it. Chicken di pana - thin slices of breaded chicken cooked to perfection in a white wine sauce. The serving size is pretty generous and therefore, you might even be left wondering how you would be able to complete the accompanying broccoli and mashed potatoes Veggie Burger - This is par excellence. Neatly done patties that seem to be quite freshly made from a combination of rice and beans. Brought in with sliced onions, lettuce, tomatoes and jalapenos. The patty is topped with a cheese - and I believe you can let them know your choice of it.

C C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,225,281,3.0,9/15/2015,"I stopped by for lunch on a weekday. They weren't very busy, and we were quickly seated. Our server was nice, and the service was timely. We were served bread first, and it was delicious. Warm and soft, it tasted like it was fresh out of the oven. There were two kinds, one brown and one white. Both were good, but I liked the brown better. It was a little sweet. I did enjoy the crisper crust of the white bread, though. I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. My sister had a kale and quinoa salad, and my mom ordered a turkey sandwich off the ""skinny menu."" I was pretty happy with my choice; as a shareable appetizer, it was actually a lot for one person. The three sauces were delicious and so flavorful. The vegetables were fresh, and the red cabbage was particularly delicious since it's usually so tough in texture. Unfortunately, the texture of the noodles was not good--they weren't chewy at all. It tasted like they'd been refrigerated to cool down quickly. The salad was good, but the dressing made it a little too salty. My mom enjoyed her burger, but I guess there was a caloric price to pay because it looked really small and sad on a large plate. I don't think she was full, either. So bottom line for the entrées of the day is, yummy with some drawbacks. And of course we had to get dessert. This is the only restaurant we ever get dessert. And on those rare occasions in other restaurants when we get dessert, we always get one to share. But at the Cheesecake Factory, each person gets his or her own cheesecake slice. My sister got the strawberry, my mom got caramel du leche, and I ordered the 30th anniversary one, which is cheesecake layered with chocolate cake. The crust is made of chocolate in various forms. It was so rich, I couldn't get in more than a few bites. But for the next few days, I had a delicious treat in the fridge! Everyone else enjoyed their cheesecake, too.

Nary K.,"Philadelphia, PA",47,36,81,3.0,5/9/2016,"Came here for Mother's Day brunch. The wait wasn't too long, appx 10 minutes. I would've rather waited longer at a better restaurant. I usually have a good experience here but this time, something was not quite right with the food. I ordered a brunch special- chicken and waffles with eggs Benedict. Sounds delicious right? Nope! The waffles were ok. The chicken was moist but was smothered in the hollandaise sauce so I couldn't taste the flavor of the chicken. I don't understand the little potatoes they give you as a side  why not regular size potatoes or hash browns? Anyway, my husband ordered a breakfast combo, pancakes, eggs and bacon. Nothing spectacular. The best part of my meal was the carrot cake I ordered to go. Despite the less than mediocre food, I'd still go back b/c their menu is so extensive that I could try something different each time and hope it tastes good. *the waitress was very nice and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=60

Patricia B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,1.0,7/22/2016,"Beyond disappointing!! If I could give no stars...I would. It was the worst expensive lunch we ever had. The service was horrblie...we were forgotten and ignored. Food took over 45 minutes to come out and they were not even busy.  I highly suggest that you ask the price of their alcoholic drinks before ordering. A 5 oz. daquiri should not cost $8.95 and could not taste any alcohol in it. And my watered-down-all- ice (even though I specifically told the waitress very little ice) sangria was $10.25!!!  I think I may have gotten about 3 oz.of drink, if that .And the six small pieces of cheese bread costs no where near to $8.95 - and charging $3 for seltzer water with lemon is outrageous.  The portions were average to very little. The Asian Lettuce Wraps was bascially lettuce filled with rice noodles - the piece of chicken was literally 2 bites. The Chicken & Biscuits was served with burnt bottoms (biscuits).  I know we could have complained to the wiatress but she was no where and I mean no where to be found the entire time we were eating.  We had to wave her down as she passed by to get our check.  She never came back for payment so I went to the hostess to pay - was informed she can not take payment and must pay the waitress. I explained we had been waiting for her to come back to our table for over 10 minutes. The hostess did not ask who our waitress was or offer to get her for us.  I took the opprotunity to air all of my complaints to the hostess. And, all we got was ""Oh, I'm sorry.""  Really??  The manager was standing behind her as I voiced my complaints and did not say or do anything just ignored me - not even help with finding our waitress to pay our bill.   So, I actually had to track our waitress down in  the restaurant to pay the check.

My boyfriend and I ordered 2 apps, 1 entree each, a root beer, and a mai tai.  The apps were decent, I guess. We got the calamari and the portabella mushroom, avocado and zucchini fries. Both were breaded in the same fashion and both of them has a rather smoky (not in a good way but like they re-used the oil a few times too many) flavor.  My boyfriend got a kobe burger and it was big but bland. No flavor. He asked for a medium rare and it came out rare. He would've ordered a steak if he wanted rare. The fries were also terrible. How do you mess up on french fries? I got a dish that is supposedly ""shepherd's pie"" but it was definitely not. It was just patty meat chopped up in gravy with mash on top. Disappointing.  The only reason why I even gave a star was because the waitress was so sweet. But I came here for food not to make a friend.  I will not be coming back unless if I'm there to pick up some dessert.

Vy D.,"Philadelphia, PA",397,123,361,4.0,1/27/2014,"Moral of the story: Haters gonna hate Story: My lovely mother decided to finally eat at a place that does not serve Vietnamese food for once in celebration of her birthday. Excitedly, I asked which cuisine she had decided on for me to take her to. In her cute Vietnamese accent, ""CHEESECAKE!,"" she announced. In my head, I cringed. Aside from their cheesecakes, I have not eaten here for a long time. So I then silently chanted these thoughts during our car ride: +Ridiculous long lines +Horrible service +Fusion food gone wrong +Uneatable humongous portions  On this particular night, all of my preconceived notions about CF were defied. We arrived on a weekday's night and were seated immediately much to my amazement. We avoided the usual hordes of hungry patrons holding their buzzers standing around the entrance and exit on any given weekend's night.  The quality of food was well-executed. I ordered the bang-bang chicken and shrimp served with brown rice, chile, curry, coconut, and sautéed vegetables. It was very flavorful. I finished it all! Also ordered the vegetarian burger and salads and enjoyed every bite. Washed it all down with a glass of delicious red wine sangria. We then finished off with a heavenly slice of dulce de leche caramel cheesecake.  Our server, Olena, was extraordinary. Her genuine friendliness and helpfulness was truly appreciated. She paid attention to the small details of our dining experience. It was truly exceptional service for any restaurant, especially a chain.  Lesson learned- so whatever mom wants she gets.

N M.,"Elkins Park, PA",0,1,,1.0,8/6/2016,"As much as I like their cakes and especially the strawberry shortcake, I don't think I will ever be going back there. After having lunch one day, my husband and I decided to get some cake to go on the way out. Well, there was a man behind the counter and he was cleaning up and then tying a trash bag. He had gloves on--great! Except then, after another person took our order, the first man took out a to go box with the same gloves that he used to clean and tie the trash bag and picked up a slice of cake, (with those same gloves!) and put it in that box. Personally, I think that is unacceptable.  Several months later, we came back hoping things have changed for the better. Did they? Only in my dreams, unfortunately. My husband came to pick up a to-go order of strawberry shortcake. The lady behind the counter didn't know how to make it so she asked her co-worker; fine. However, there was about 1tbsp of strawberries left in their container so she poured it all out into the little box. My husband mentioned that it probably won't be enough. She said, ""this is how much we give everyone"" after just minutes earlier saying that she didn't know how to make it. AND, we've gotten strawberry shortcake before and it certainly comes with more than just 1 cut-up strawberry! The manager happened to walk by; she whispered something into his ear, he gave my husband a dirty look and walked off. Another man, who was cleaning the counters,  chopped up 2 more strawberries (without changing gloves or washing his hands) and added them to what was already in the container. Yuck. Then, he went, took orders, came back and with the same gloves, continued to put cakes for people; obviously he touched the cakes.  I don't know about anyone else, but personally, I don't find it very sanitary to ties garbage bags, wash counters and then use the same gloves to touch people's food. I mean, they're gloves! You're not even washing your hands, just changing them! Is it really that big of a deal?!  I know some of you may think I'm making more of this than I should and maybe I'm a little too much of a germaphobe, but personally, when I see hygiene complaints on reviews, I avoid places because really, it's unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=80

We checked in with the hostess about 2-3 times over the next half hour, and was told each time that our table was almost ready. It wasn't until 8pm that we were finally seated. Service was fine getting our drinks out in a timely manner. However, when the bread and butter was brought out, we still had no silverware at our table. After waiting a few minutes unnoticed, we pulled a waitress aside and asked for silverware/table settings. No one had even noticed that we were without table settings. 5 minutes later, a waiter/busboy(?), came out and plopped two napkins full of silverware at one end of the table and left. No settings were placed, an no one followed up with us.  I have never felt so disrespected at a restaurant. Honestly, Chick Fil-A gives me better service than this.

Jamie C.,"Vancouver, Canada",23,60,138,4.0,12/2/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is our go to restaurant when shopping at the Willow Grove Mall. My mom and I like to go on Sundays when they offer the extended breakfast/brunch menu.  Recently we went in and they offered a free cheesecake slice gift card for purchasing a $25+ gift card.  We ran into this deal a few times in the past holiday seasons so I bought a gift card and was able to use the gift card right away, but the cheesecake voucher cannot be used the same day.  Which is fine with me, I can wait till later to use it! My favorites from the ""Brunch"" menu which is offered only on Sundays until 3pm are the Bruleed French Toast, Lemon-Ricotta Pancake, and the Baja Chicken Hash. The Bruleed French Toast is humongous... well, most of their dishes are, but I've never finished the french toast in one sitting.  It's not an overpowering creme brulee flavor, but just the right amount.   Same goes for the Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes.  It has a faint lemon and ricotta taste.  I love lemon flavors in pastries and breakfast items so this is definitely one of my favorites!  It's usually topped with sliced strawberries but I've seen people ask for different fruit toppings and they weren't charged extra for the replacement. For both the sweet brunch dishes, you don't get any savory sides with them, but you can order meat or a breakfast side if you'd like.  I think the french toast actually does apprear again on the menu with a side included, but I've never ordered it that way. If I'm not in the mood for something sweet, I always get the Baja Chicken Hash for brunch.  It's a generous portion with two large crisp tortillas topped with veggies, chicken, beans, and poached eggs.  So delicious! Aside from the brunch menu, Cheesecake Factory has so many different options on their menu... it'll take you a while to look through everything if it's your first time, but everything is really pretty tasty :)  My favorites on regular menu: Miso Salmon Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta Chicken Bellagio Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=80

I ordered the tomato basil pasta and he had the Steak Diane and salmon. When the food finally arrived, both our dishes were slightly cold and his steak was over-cooked. We told the waitress who took his dish back to the kitchen. The pasta wasn't too bad so we kept it. Until I noticed there was a stray spaghetti noodle in the penne. We called the waitress over who had a long explanation of how it ""happens all the time."" Finally, my boyfriend's dish was replaced. The steak was not flavorful at all and not worth the money we paid for it. We finished our meals and left incredibly dissatisfied. We forgot about the whole experience until, a few hours later, my boyfriend began to experience a stomach ache and eventually developed nausea. Over the course of the next 10 hours, he has had intense stomach pain and threw up five times.

Crab cakes, ahi tuna salad, chicken potstickers and endive salad with blue cheese. My entree was soft shell shrimp taco and my hubby ordered a veggie burger. I don't care too much for the endive salad because the blue cheese and the endive was too bitter for me. Crab cake was good but theres no lump of crabmeat thou. Ahi salad was very tasty with the lime, avocado and cilantro. My only problem with the place was that it's extremely dark. I also notice that my spoon was extremely dirty, luckily I didn't need to use a spoon for my meal.

Veronica K.,"Feasterville, PA",249,406,221,3.0,9/29/2013,"I'd always been wary of the Cheesecake Factory, mostly due to their insanely priced cheesecakes themselves. Before my visit here, I'd only ever got cake to go from the KoP location, and despite the good quality, $8 for a slice of cheesecake seems steep. Anyway, I ended up at the Willow Grove location last night because a friend wanted to have her birthday party there. I'll start with the good; the food was (mostly) delicious. I had their loaded nachos (don't remember the menu name), which consisted of thick nachos that seemed to be fried on premises. I also had the chicken samosas, which were awesome, and while not completely authentic, they had a nice curry flavor that was palatable for American taste buds but still distinctly tasted like an Indian masala. Also, their cheesecake is obviously quite good. I had some of their new s'more edition and it lived up to the hype. Also, I tend to like the decor inside, even if it is quite dark. So here's the cons. My house salad was disgusting - the salad itself was wilted and the vinaigrette they put on it only served to make the aging leaves even more bitter. Luckily, this was the only bad item anyone got and the rest of our food was edible. Worse than this, is that the staff, particularly hostesses, are very rude. They seemed angry we had a large group, and gave us poor accommodations so that one person had to sit on a rickety chair in the middle of the aisle. Also our waitress seemed over worked and barely checked on us, so sadly I personally will refrain from ever going there on a Saturday again, as the attitude was too much. For being a chain, it's not bad. I'll come again on a week day and do an update, and see if any of my issues are resolved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=100

Joshua M.,"Boca Raton, FL",270,288,914,4.0,8/14/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants, plain and simple. Actually, one of my favorite restaurants period. First off, Cheesecake Factory has literally the biggest menu I've ever seen. To get to the salads, you have to go to somewhere around page 15! Normally, I'd see too menu menu options as a restaurant not knowing what it is, and just throwing everything on a page with a total disregard for quality of the product, not here. Everything I have had here has been nothing less than great. My usual order is the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which is basically a lightly breaded chicken in a lemon sauce, served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The chicken is divine, and the lemon sauce makes it perfect. Portion size is also huge, I am either beyond full if I finish it, or usually have another meal to take home. The mashed potatoes are good, but nothing to go crazy over. Recently, I've been splitting a bunch of appetizers with my friends, tapas style. For appetizers, I'd highly recommend the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Fried Macaroni and Cheese, and the Crispy Taquitos. All are phenomenal. The ones I am not the biggest fan of it the Spinach and Cheese dip (the spinach is flavorless and the cheese is just put on top), and the Quesadilla (chicken just tastes bland and processed).  The cheesecake deserves its own little section for just how good it is. Caution, the cheesecake is on the pricy side, I'd be much happier if it was a little bit cheaper. Nevertheless, they are all phenomenal. My favorite is Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, but most of the other ones I've had are equally as great. My only recommendation to Cheesecake Factory would be to setup a dessert to sample a bunch of different cheesecakes, instead of paying the price to buy a bunch of them. If this exists already, shame on me for not finding it, but if it doesn't it needs to in order to taste the bliss of all these cheesecakes at once! Atmosphere here is always very nice, and plenty of room in the booths. Service wise, it really can be a bit of hit or miss. Most times my servers have been excellent, but I've had a few that were a little slow with things like getting us water, etc. Pricing is also pretty decent, it's a little bit on the more expensive side, but still worth it for what you are getting. Chain restaurants usually have a stigma attached to them, but Cheesecake Factory delivers on every aspect. This is basically my go to place anytime I'm hungry and want great food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=100

The server took the order properly, but the kitchen skipped one of the meals. When I picked up the order, the clerk at the register said it was never given and that I could order it then and pay for it so that I wouldn't have to wait in line again. When I pointed out that the meal was written on the order, she did nothing to rectify the situation other than to want me to pay for it now so I could leave sooner when it was ready. I asked for the manager and explained the situation to him, and he was just as apathetic. Since I already had the other meals, why would I want to wait while they cooked the missing meal and have the other meals get cold? His reply was a shrug of the shoulders. The manager didn't care that I would end up with either 3 hot meals and a missing meal, or three cold meals and one hot meal. He made no offer to alleviate the situation by offering a gift certificate for a later use to try to keep my business.

They didn't actually realize that Americans genuinely eat at the Cheesecake Factory, accept that the portions are ridiculous,  and it's not really a novelty.  But really, if you want gigantic portions of reheated, bland food that's about 4,000 calories a serving, without having to wait 45 minutes for a table, maybe try sticking a few sticks of butter in the microwave for a few seconds.

David N.,"Warrington, PA",1,37,1,2.0,11/2/2013,"Generally like Cheesecake Factory and have been to this one and several others many times.  Came in after the crowd was thinning, around 9 PM.  Seated within a few minutes.  Having seen a friend order the fries well done, I did the same.  Ordered the cheeseburger medium rare.  When the food was delivered, the sogs were not cooked well and were soggy, so I sent them back.  As soon as the server left, I cut the burger and it was raw, so it went back.  (Meanwhile, the waiter comes over to ask how our food was and I told him both items on my plate were prepared wrong.)  My wife always has the Santa Fe Chicken Salad, but tonight it was sub-par as well -- not enough dressing, corn or avocado.  Well, the fries came back and were golden and crisp -- also nice and warm.  About 20 minutes later (and the waiter saying he had checked on it), the burger came back and it was cooked to perfection as well.  Had to ask to get a refill on my iced tea, which is very unusual for Cheesecake Factory.   No real apology from the waiter and no visit from a manager.  Not offered anything off the check or even a piece of cheesecake.  In fact, I think the waiter was ready for us to leave, since he did not even offer dessert when I asked for the check.   Next time at the mall, plan to try Bravo next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=160

The con is there is always a wait, but I believe it is worth it. While we were waiting, we had tropical martinis at the bar and they are my favorite!  We were a group of three and ordered the following: Appetizer - Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - one of my faves!  Barbeque Burger - cooked well done but was still juicy and delicious. Chicken Enchiladas - pretty good. large portion and took over half of it home. Sauce was good but rice didn't taste like spanish rice to me. Tasted more like a garlic & herb rice mix. Not a fan of the rice. Order this dish and ask for double beans instead. Crusted Chicken Romano - chicken cooked very good and was tender. Potatoes were tasty.  Dessert - Reeses Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake. I usually like my cheesecake plain, but I was out-voted that night. It was really good and the chocolate cake part of the cheesecake was very moist. Everything tasted fresh. Our waiter was excellent and super attentive. Had a nice personality and had fun with us. I think his name was Andy but I'm not sure. The cheesecake factory is a good place if you are looking for something familiar to eat with consistency.

Melissa K.,"Perkasie, PA",35,44,9,4.0,5/5/2013,"I have been to this location a couple times and I think it is time I gave it a review.  Usually I come with my Nan, but this time it was my boyfriend's first time at a Cheesecake Factory. We had to wait 15 minutes before being seated, however, they did accommodate my request for a booth, and so it was worth the wait.  The overall appearance of this location is very spacious and airy.  The outside dining was open, but it was a little too cold for outside still.  The color scheme is warm and friendly and the bathrooms were clean.      We grabbed a drink from the bar while we waited; I had a Caribbean cooler and my other half had a glass of Shiraz.  We were acknowledged within a minute of arriving to the bar and they offered a drink menu, which was helpful, but it took too long to get our drinks and to cash out.  The bar is small but nice, but waiting to order a drink and to cash out while standing- made the experience at the bar unpleasant and not one I would return to anytime soon.  I would not order the Caribbean Cooler again because it tasted like an expensive Slurpee with fresh fruit- I could barely taste the rum, but I will take the fresh pineapple, lime and strawberry.  Also, when the sunset it was nice to have that curtain drawn down so it was not in our eyes.  When we were seated, the waitress greeted us promptly and got us water and bread quickly, which was appreciative.   The bread was warm and tasty, but the butter is always too cold and hard to spread. Her service was timely and she did not make us wait.  Food: I had the four cheese pasta with chicken and an order Edamame as my vegetable.   The Edamame is always tasty and crisp.  The only thing I wish they had was sea salt to sprinkle on it.   The four cheese pasta dish was HUGE and tasty; chicken was tender and juicy.  I liked how they brought the dish right when it was ready rather than wait for my boyfriend's dish because pasta gets cold and 'funky' quick.  I do wish there was more of a sauce on the pasta rather than it being dry.  My boyfriend got the combination of Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane.  As a first timer to the factory, he loved the food- both from the land and the sea.  He ordered the mash potatoes as his vegetable and he greatly enjoyed them too.  He also ordered a side dish of sautéed spinach, and he was not impressed with that.  I tasted it and it was very bland and some of the spinach was not completely sautéed.  Some looked like fresh leaves tossed into the dish in the last 20 seconds of sautéing.   We ordered a cup of coffee, which was from a fresh pot, and it was good.  I always get my Dulce de Leche Carmel Cheesecake, which is always amazing!  (EVERY calorie of 1000+ :-P)  He got the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle and he loved it!  I taste it, and for not a chocolate cheesecake or cake fan- the raspberry was AMAZING!  It tasted amazing with a sip of his Shiraz.   The prices are a little high, especially when it came to the sautéed spinach and Edamame.  We will eventually visit again, but not anytime soon due to the geographic location and prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=140

Everything on the menu is good.  (some things are delicious, but the ""hit"" percentage is really low when you take into account all of the items on their menu.) Seating is comfortable. (seating sucks.  especially for big groups.  the whole booth side/chair side thing really sucks.  especially because no one has been able to master the whole ""equal height"" thing with chairs and booths yet in the restaurant industry.) i don't hate it here, i just wouldn't choose it for myself.  i still go every time my friends do.  if you go and dare to get anything OTHER than cheesecake, i highly recommend the carrot cake.  it's probably the best thing i've had off of their menu. they don't do reservations or call ahead.  if you're planning on eating with a group of 6 or more, it's usually best to get one loser--er, volunteer--to head over at least an hour early to put your name in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=200

Raymond P.,"Philadelphia, PA",25,10,,4.0,3/12/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory seems to have a very... tough audience here.  The fact that there is a long wait to get seated shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that has ever seen one and so, to me, is something you accept when going there.  While I have been seated quickly once or twice, it's generally a half-hour to forty-five minute wait to be seated.  Given the selection they have it ends up being well worth the wait to me. The Cheesecake Factory is more like an upscale diner in my opinion.  Their menu is as varied as a diner and the atmosphere can be very entertaining and noisy.  The differences though come when you actually get your food.  Huge portions that have never failed to satisfy me along with a price point that won't kill your wallet.  I can safely recommend around two dozen items on the menu but, I would say the best things I've had on there are the Chicken and Biscuits along with the Double BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger.  If you're a nut that loves to indulge when it comes to eating out, grab one of those two entrées! I don't think there is a need to talk about the cheesecake here.  While I'm a fan of their cheesecakes (the Adams Peanut Butter especially), they sometimes overdo it with alternate flavors and, to be quite honest, their plain cheesecake can't top a regular slice of New York Style... and that's how you judge a cheesecake.  I find that Cheesecake Factory's plain cheesecake is a little too creamy and it doesn't have enough solidity to it. I'm a big foodie and I'm always looking for places with great food, and the reviews here make me feel kind of main stream by giving this place a 4/5... but whatever   I'm not big into standard chain restaurants such as Olive Garden, Fridays or Applebee's, but this place gets my vote.   The wait?  Get over it, you expected it!  The food?  Better then you're giving it credit for!  The atmosphere?  It's loud but its fun!  Yes, I truly love this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=200

Carlucci F.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,16,1,3.0,1/25/2009,"A 90-minute wait on a Saturday night. They give you a plastic device that vibrates when your table is ready. Luckily, or unfortunately, the joint is attached to the mall, allowing you to wander to Sbarro's for a quick slice to hold you over on your wait. Or, you could go to Circuit City and check out some liquidation sales. The choice is yours. We went to Ruby Tuesday's for some drinks.  The lobby outside of the Cheesecake Factory is kind've like the airport when there's a delayed flight. Bodies lying on the ground and looking around in despair, just hoping their plastic stick vibrates soon.  Once we got our table, you are treated promptly with an excitable waitstaff. We had Kevin, or Dan, or Jimmy -- I forget his name. Helluva waiter though, especially since he had to deal with my lame jokes. I can't recall the decor there, other than the lavish glass light fixtures. It's quite dark in there, but the waitstaff are all dressed in white like ghosts.  There is a miniscule bar, and if you're fortunate enough to get a spot you can chill out and watch sports in HD.  The bathrooms are delightful. Definitely try it out. They serve butter with your bread. I prefer oil, but sometimes you just have to take one for the team. I got the Thai Chicken Pasta, and even though it's not a Thai restaurant, it was surprisingly averagely decent.  The service is fast and the entrees arrive all at the same time and extremely hot. The portions are quite large. You may be walking around with a dainty doggy-bag aftewards, so be forewarned.  Loads of Cheesecake options for dessert. If you like a Snicker's bar crumpled up into a cheesecake, they got it. Oreos? No problem...Huge thick-ass slices. Long story short, if you have 3 hours to kill and like to amble about the mall aimlessly in doubt as to whether you'll actually get your table, then this is the place for you. If you want a quick bite to eat, I suggest the Food Court.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=200

Sandra D.,"Philadelphia, PA",21,10,,1.0,5/23/2015,"Me and good friend went to Cheese Cake factory this evening , the seating time was excellent but the service and the managers response had allot to be desired. The waitress brought things to our table a little at a time, she asked us if we wanted bread rather than just bring the bread to the table as most waitresses/waiters do.. She answered about a dish my friend had had before even knowing if the dish was available. The last straw was when we both asked for cheesecake, the carmel pecan, my friend had hers brought out to the table where I opted to take to go. My friend told me that tend to give you a larger piece of cheesecake when you order it to eat in but I didn't believe it. Well, she was right. When I asked the waitress about it, she said she would have to get her manager. It took about 10 minutes before the manager, Allie, appeared. When I told her what the problem was, at first she said she didn't the other slice of cheese cake, my friend showed it to her, then she began to say it was pre-sliced and all were the same size, which clearly you could see that wasn't true. Then to make a bad matter worst she got loud with me and said if I didn't want it they would remove it from my bill which she did. Very disappointed with the service and the manager.

The food options were great, but the food is rather bland. (The only obvious exception is the cheesecake) While their menu was worldly, their spices and cooking style were not.  I value quality over quantity, because I'd rather have a few cups full of delicious pasta rather then pounds of over cooked boring pasta. During another attempt, we called for the to-go service that brings food to your car. We arrived 15 minutes earlier than the time they said it would ready. And ended up waiting more than an hour to get our food. Eventually we went in, and the service person was no where to be found, but our bag was ready, they gave it to us COLD.

Harvey G.,"ELKINS PARK, PA",0,3,,2.0,1/30/2015,"The food is always good as is the service, but... the manager can learn a thing or two. The place is usually busy, with long waits, so I called about ten minutes before arriving and asked about the wait. The young lady on the phone said ""No wait, come right over."" Upon arrival, I noticed throngs of people standing and waiting for tables. I waited my turn and asked about the length of the wait. I was told less than 30 minutes by the hostess at the desk. I explained about my calling earlier and how i was told that there was no wait. She insisted, it was not possible and that was mistaken. I showed her their phone number on my phone to document that I called. Forty-five minutes later, still no table. I asked to see the manager and explained what happened. I said that his staff should not tell people, that call, that there is no wait, when they call in advance. I also explained that I was told, upon arrival, that the wait would be thiry minutes and that it was now over forty-five minutes. The Manager applogized. That was it! He didn't offer to seat us or look into it. Just an appology and a blank stare. Unacceptable! At least offer to look into what happened, offer us a glass of wine, a complimentary appetizer or a free dessert. Perhaps, the Cheesecake Factory, and its Management, should consider how it handles dissatisfied customers. There are plenty of other good restaurants in the neighborhood.

Both drinks were very appetizing, but they could have been just a little stronger. We started off with two appetizers the Spicy Ahi Tuna Roll and the Avocado Egg rolls, which were very delicious. For entrees my girlfriend had the Chicken Madeira and I had the Bang-bang  Chicken and Shrimp, we both tasted each others dishes and they were fabulous. The portions were huge, my dish tasted so amazing with the coconut and curry flavors and my girlfriends chicken was very tasty and bursting with flavor.

Teri M.,"Rockledge, PA",116,100,105,3.0,5/24/2010,"I used to rave about this place back when you couldn't ever find it. There was one in King of Prussia and one in South Jersey and I would be excited to go when I got the chance. Sure the cheesecake is the thing to get, but I am not the biggest cheesecake eater so it's not that big of a deal to me. Besides, if you eat dinner here, sometimes it's impossible to stuff anything else in your stomach once it's time for dessert. When I used to go, we would get the buffalo bites...they are great. They had some cold spring rolls that were pretty good too. The last time I went to one, it was this Willow Grove Mall location. one day I went in just for cheesecake with a girlfriend and our kids during off-peak after lunch hours. It was fine. Then I went for dinner with my husband and the kids and I was disappointed with the kids' food. The mac & cheese was like macaroni noodles coated with butter...where was the cheese? The kids were being picky and didn't even want the grilled chicken. What is irritating is I had to order the kids' chicken w/ broccoli and the macaroni separate...why can't mac & cheese be a side? It was a HUGE bowl of oily/buttery mac & cheese. I guess it tasted alright but I find it disgusting to serve all of that as a meal. My fish tacos were pretty good, I was happy with them. The beans were a bit overspiced, I like heat and all, but the fish tacos were spicy as it was, then the beans but the killer was the spanish rice. I hated the rice...my mouth was already on fire and here the rice was spicy too and they put peas and carrots and corn in it. I could understand a little corn for a southwest touch but peas and carrots in spanish rice? Gross. As far as the spice goes, they could have at least put some sour cream on the plate. Even the guacamole was spicy. And I never got a refill on my water....huge pet peeve. Good thing I had a beer with my water. My husband didn't really like what he ordered. I can't even remember what it was now....guess it was forgettable. I don't know if it's related or not, but my kids got a stomach bug a day or so after we ate there and it was not pretty. I hope there wasn't any bacteria from the restaurant's handling or food prep, but I have no way to decipher how my kids got sick, but they don't go to school and didn't get out much that week. What a shame...usually I liked the place, but we didn't have kids with us and we ordered appetizers before.

Zahir C.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",81,29,2,5.0,3/11/2013,"This rating is primarily for the service at the Willow Grove Cheesecake Factory. I was there for my aunt's bday party with my  last Friday night which is typically an extremely busy night for any restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful to our party. I will start by saying that my aunt is bound to a wheel chair, they were helpful in making sure our family was seated in area with enough space for her and her wheelchair, moving tables and chairs to do so. Our party was also pretty large, about 15 ppl, and they were extremely helpful and accommodating with that as well. One of my cousins brought along her 2 toddler age children, who broke a plate halfway through dinner and made a mess. The staff cleaned the mess up quickly and with no attitude and were so nice to the kids during the process. Any requests that we made were quickly and accurately fulfilled for us! I don't usually write yelp reviews but felt extremely inclined to do so after this fantastic service that helped to make my aunts birthday extra special! I have a very big and loud family that can usually find a reason to complain about any and everything but there were no complaints about the service this night. Thank you for the wonderful dining experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=220
Theresa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,40,,4.0,9/21/2007,"I was fortunate to get a complimentary ticket to a private seating at the new Cheesecake Factory that is opening in the Willow Grove Mall.   My review is as follows: Cold - Service in getting food was slow - Our waitress was very nice and on top of things (acknowledged & apologized for the delay) - Food was EXCELLENT. So if you have to go, wear layers ... don't be in a hurry to get in and get out ... enjoy the meal when it finally arrives!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=220
Stella H.,"Hatboro, PA",0,166,,2.0,3/11/2013,"Been awhile since my last visit, so stopped in over the weekend for a mid-day lunch while shopping.   It's never NOT crowded, but since there were only two of us, we were seated immediately.  The word ""Factory"" is exactly what this felt like -- get 'em in feed 'em quick, and get 'em out so that we can turn tables over.  Our server was harried from the moment she took our drink order (took her a good 10 minutes to even acknowledge us!), there was positively no eye contact during the entire visit, and absolutely no warm and fuzzy coming from her.  I did like their expanded ""skinny"" menu (which is what I ordered from, as did my dining companion).  I had the chicken salad sandwich, which was OK.  My companion had a salad, which was also just OK.  Between the noise level, the hustle and bustle, the impersonalization of our server, coupled with the fact that they clearly want you in and out as quickly as possible, I think they hit it right on the nose with ""Factory.""  Oh, we did not have cheesecake at this particular visit - maybe I would have left in a better state of mind??  Hmmmm.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=220
Lillian C.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,8,6,2.0,9/27/2009,"Well well well, I finally made it to the CCF in willow grove. Heard a lot of good things about this place so i decided to pick this one tonight for our outing with family and friends 8 of us and 1 infant. OK, let's start with the wait! My daughter goes to the desk and tells the lady that we have a party of eight and a baby. She gave her this gadget that would notify us when our table would be available. She told us about 45 minutes and that we should venture the mall and wait on the page from them, here's the problem, I came to eat tonight! Not to go shopping or browsing! I was hungry! The plan was a night out for dinner. Neither the less, my husband whine up in Macy's and come out with a bag! Wow! A new jacket. Now, 2 hours later we finally get a page! Thank you! Somebody heard my stomach! So we all gather at the desk waiting to be escorted to our table. Guest what? That took another 15 minutes! Go figure! So now about the service, which I would give 3 stars to because we had to ask the waiter to remove our dishes after the appetizers. We where so crammed at our table we just didn't feel comfortable, too tight. For starters we ordered hand battered onion rings, which I've had better, the buffalo chicken wings where spicy hot at first bite but, after a few more bites you become use to it.not bad though, had better wings at Bennie the bums in the northeast. The crispy crab bites where pretty good i would definitely order them again.Now for the main course my husband and I ordered the beef ribs which came with skinny crispy onion rings and French fries which was surprisingly good! The meat on those ribs where falling off the bone! Very good taste too. Our other guest ordered fettuccine Alfredo chicken which was to bland for my taste. The Kobe burger looked overcooked, dry. The barbecue salmon was ok, but I don't think we would order that again. The bang bang chicken and shrimp was just as bad! I see we will have to choose from the menu more wisely. The chicken Bellagio was tolerable. But let me add this one last thing, the 35th anniversary cheese cake was to die for! Man I would ride all the way back here just for a slice of that cheesecake! Will we go back? Yes, will we order the same thing, uh, no. Except for them darn ribs! Boy they where good!  Enough said.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=220

Ilya H.,"Philadelphia, PA",52,23,2,4.0,9/19/2009,"Went there for lunch.  The menu is insane there is about 30 things to choose from. Ended up with the biggest burger I've seen (it had steak strips and bacon on top..ridiculous) my date had the Navajo Chicken sandwich. My burger was great, her sandwich was ok. Drinks are good.

M. C.,"Willow Grove, PA",0,29,,4.0,2/24/2010,"I was really surprised to read so many negative reviews. While this is not my favorite restaurant around, I like it a lot. I guess I'm not a real adventurous eater but I always get their chicken Caesar salad. The bad part of that is that it is way too large to eat in one sitting. Even their ""small"" is too large to eat. But it is delicious. The dressing is very tangy. I also sometimes get a side of mac 'n' cheese. If I recall correctly, it is penne pasta. I like it although it's not as good as the homemade baked kind. Many times I was too full for dessert but I did manage to try the dessert a couple times. I think I had the Snickers at least once. I am a cheesecake fan and a Snickers fan so it worked for me. The menu is huge and can be overwhelming. The jewelry ads and whatnot are kind of strange in the middle of the menu, but whatever. The menu is immense so there should be something for everyone. The service has always been decent for me. I love the location and that I don't have to go to King of Prussia anymore. I've experienced the long wait many other reviewers referred to but I've always been in there and seated fairly promptly, at less busy times I guess. So I say give it a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=220

Jamie M.,"Furlong, PA",0,4,,4.0,12/12/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurant. My husband and I often come here when we decide to dine out. The food is good, my favorite is chicken and sausage gumbo, very tasty. I would recommend to direct order if you want to taste the cheesecake, which is the best place to get. At our first time, we ordered appetizer and entrees for each and ended up take out the cheesecake for dessert at home. If you come here on a warm day, don't forget to order a glass of pina colada, it is wonderful. The servers are nice and helpful. The only thing is that they do not take reservation on weekend, which make us to come very early for dinner to avoid the wait. Never ever come around 7 pm or you have to wait 90 mins at the mall next door. Hope you all enjoy the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=220
DJ M.,"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",453,794,3722,2.0,2/19/2009,"First Impressions:  Note this was my first and last visit to the Cheesecake Factory.  When you first pull up to this Cheesecake Factory you are greeted by an enormous gold stucco building with a lot of windows. It over shadowed the Ruby Tuesday's a few doors down. There is a nice sized patio with heat lamps and street lamp lighting. Upon walking through the doors you first notice the high vaulted ceilings. It took everything I had not to scream Hello, just so I could hear my echo. One reviewer said they were 30 feet high. The next claimed them to be 40 feet high. I am going to jump out on a limb and say they were 52 and 1/2 feet high.  The floors are of limestone and the upholstered cherry wood high booths claim some privacy. The lighting is very contemporary with amber shades on the walls and tapestry skylights. Huge columns are scattered about with amber shades of light glowing.  To the right is a massive sized, glass encased counter with more cheesecake than one could ever dream about. Straight in front of you is the hostess desk. To your left is the large open dining room and the very small, yet decorative bar. Get there early to secure a stool. The lounge area has high top tables with stools.  A little Cheesecake Factory History:  There are over 161 Restaurants with over 50 kinds of cheesecakes. The Grand Lux Cafe is a subsidiary of theirs. The CCF was the first restaurant chain to reach a billion dollars in revenues with fewer than 100 restaurants in operation. The first CCF was opened in Beverly Hills, Ca. in 1978. Evelyn Overton sold her first Cheesecake in 1949. She baked them in her basement for restaurants and her husband Oscar handled the sales. They then opened a small shop in their home town of Detroit, Michigan. After her children were grown and gone, she and her husband moved to Los Angeles. The rest is history.  Our Experience: BYOF  Our server was very friendly and informative and greeted us almost immediately. Since there are over 200 items on this menu, It was like reading a textbook. She was patient with my needing to read every item. With all to choose from, we probably ordered all wrong. I started with the Baked Potato Soup. It was loaded with veggies, cheese and bacon. It was on the brownish side and tasted old and burned. We shared Fried Zucchini as an appetizer. They were your typical frozen and fried zucchini, nothing special. The ranch dressing that was served with it was unbelievably sweet. It did not compliment the zucchini at all. Hubby had a Cheese Burger, $10.95 and said wow when he first got it. He was not thrilled once he started eating it. The patties were preformed and frozen prior to cooking. With the burger came a large amount of ice cold shoestring fries. I ordered a MR Filet.  It took so long, I knew it would be over cooked and hubby and I both think the server knew too. I cut into it and it was MW. Goofy looking Filet too, flat and almost as big as the plate?! She took it back and brought me the MR. I must say it was flavorful and tender. I opted for Mac & Cheese as my side. I know, I am so silly. The Mac & Cheese was one step up from Kraft. When she presented the check, she had taken the Filet off. Portions are large, prices are as high as their ceiling. The Filet was $34.95 and I am not at Ruths' Chris! We took our piece of Key Lime Cheesecake and Carrot Cake home. The desserts are very good and I would consider using take out for desserts only. They also ship Cheesecakes via Federal Express. Three managers sat together at a high top table in the Lounge.  One young attractive server entertained them the entire time of our visit.  Not once did I see a manager get up to greet or check on a table.  All three were very young and I am sure there for the easy paycheck.   If and when I ever receive $50.00 in Gift Cards for the CCF again, I will order Cheesecakes to go. That is how they started. That is what they specialize in and they do know how to do it right.  As for the 200 menu items, it is a chain, what did you expect? Come on Toni, come and say "" I told you so! ""  ;+} My Dipping sauce for Fried Zucchini, Onion Rings, Fried Mushrooms: 1 part mayo, to 1 part sour cream, to 1/2 part horse-radish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=220

Nicole W.,"Haverhill, MA",157,228,256,5.0,2/13/2011,"I love this Cheesecake Factory!!!! I was a bit afraid since I experienced a total let down at my first Cheesecake Factory experience in Chicago- but this place was fantastic. Because my party was large we did have to wait a while but the food made it worth the wait. I also ordered a strawberry daquiri at the bar and it was nicely mixed if not a bit pricey. My mother had a couple of long islands and appeared to really enjoy them. The food was all around delicious. I stole food from all my family members plates and was very happy. The steaks sometimes aren't made the way I and my father prefer them (rare to medium rare) but I can get over that if they are seasoned nicely, which they were. The mashed potatoes were scrumptious and most other sides were tasty as well. The cheesecakes were, of course, utterly delicious. Pricey but delicious non the less. This place will take a pretty penny out of your wallet but it's one of the best chain restaurants to go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=220

Michael C.,"Abington, PA",31,37,3,3.0,4/15/2008,"took my family to the cheesecake factory in the willow grove mall. Had heard wonderful things. But wasn't totally impressed. The foot doors and the 40 foot ceilings are a way out of control. Why would you want to do this to a restaurant? This is more like a dance club.  The service was pretty good. The place wasn't crowded, but was active. The prices were pretty high, but the amount of food they give you is beyond eatable in one sitting. Not sure if eatable is a word, but I think you get my meaning.  Seems weird, but the menus were very difficult to read. Not the print or design, but the advertisements and order. Every time you turned a page, you saw a listing of food and a full page add for something. Jewelry, cars, whatever. I found that tacky. Combined with the overdone decor, It wasn't my favorite atmosphere. But no big, to food was good. Except for the burger. My daughter ordered the Fun burger, which sounded fun. Actually, it's just a big mac, but looked really good. Unfortunately, they didn't cook it enough, and my stomach was turning all night. Yeah, I eat off everyones plate. mmmm. Anyway, if you go, make sure to order your burger well, be ready for a big tab, and a big meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-willow-grove?start=240
