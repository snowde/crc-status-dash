Samantha B.,"Orlando, FL",109,1,1,1.0,7/14/2017,"I visited The Cheesecake Factory today and ordered the Beef Pit Dip. When the sandwich arrived at my table it was extremely soggy and held together with toothpicks. I shrugged it off and took a bite and realized it was extremely chewy. I assumed I had a piece of fat in my mouth until the next bite was just as chewy with an odd taste. Because of the dark lighting in the restaurant I wasn't able to see that the beef on my sandwich was almost entirely raw. I literally took out my phone to shine a light on it and was disgusted by what I saw. I cannot believe that someone put that meat on a bun and sent it out to be eaten. I was refunded when my waitress saw the raw meat, which I do appreciate, but I have been nauseous ever since I left the restaurant early this afternoon which is why I am writing this review. So, to anyone who orders it in the future, check your bun before taking a bite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=40
Phylicia K.,"Hollywood, FL",258,547,776,5.0,1/17/2017,"This location will always have a special place in my heart! It was the place I went on my first date with my fiancee!  The location is great, very cute plaza next to a movie theater and the twinkle lights around the plaza make it nice for after dinner walks (especially when you stuff your face here at CF). The weekends tend to get busy but I feel like CF has a pretty good handle on turning tables around and seating quicker than expected. The menu is massive. MASSIVE. While I do try to be adventurous my go to has always been the bang bang chicken. The flavors in the chicken and sauce are soooo good! Portions are just as large as the menu! I always have leftovers, which is perfect since I end of craving the meal for days! Served over a bed of rice this is very filling! If you want to stay lighter, they have some great salad options. Again - massive salads! The spicy chicken is a favorite of mine as is the mexican with corn and beans. So many greens, lots of protein and very tasty dressing options.  if you are with a group don't skip out on apps to share! The bite sized burgers are great but my all time favorite are the avocado eggrolls. That tamarind cashew dipping sauce is amazing! Also make sure to not skip on dessert, it is the Cheesecake Factory after all! Classic is great but oreo is my go to! They have so many flavors, there is something for everyone! The ambiance is great here, service is awesome and if it's busy just make sure they stock you up on bread to hold you over - trust me the bread is great there too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=40
Kyle R.,"Orlando, FL",14,80,183,4.0,5/13/2017,"Last time I went here I had a bad experience and wrote this place off because I figured it was a over priced dennys. I came this time because my wife got a gift card and if it was not for that I would never come back, to my surprise the menu changed since the last time I was here and they actually have vegan options and tons of options on the menu for different taste. The vegan cob salad was great and is listed under the superfoods section. The thing that threw me off is my waitress when I ordered a vegan menu option asked if I would like to add ""chicken"". ??????????!??!?? I told her well I ordered a vegan dish why would I want chicken on it? That is the reason for 4 stars on this round.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=40
Jose A.,"Orlando, FL",277,73,740,4.0,3/26/2016,"Cheesecake Factory, what can I say. This place has been so good to me that I'm surprised it only has 3 stars on yelp. The times I've come here the service has been superb, everyone is so nice the drinks are very good and the food OMG nothing I've had here has been disappointing. My first time here I ordered the crab and artichoke dip this was so delicious, I also tried the chicken samosas OMG these are amazing a must get!  I came back another time cause this place is so nice, I got the sweet corn tamale cakes man these things are so awesome! You have to try them, I also got the famous factory meatloaf get ready cause this is a beast it's huge can feed a family of 3 lol but it has so much flavor! I got the buffalo wings to go not that great but looked much better if you get them there, next the stuffed mushrooms were really good loved them.  Just to let you know I saved the best my fav apps for last, I ordered the famous Fried macaroni and cheese, I don't even like Mac and cheese and I love this app the best thing here! I then ordered the Buffalo blasts! OMG this was so amazing I will get this again and again.

Yesenia P.,"Orlando, FL",66,89,202,4.0,8/27/2016,Anything you order off the menu will be delicious! Perfect spot for that special celebration or date night. My favorite meal is the Chicken Madeira but I've tried other entrees that are all very good. If you come here you must save room for cheesecake.

Britt M.,"Sanford, FL",4,34,,3.0,9/4/2017,"Always very crowded (even on weeknights the wait is sometimes 45 minutes at 8pm), and food quality is inconsistent. For $15-$20 per entree, poor quality isn't acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=40

My symptoms continued the next day but along with the symptoms described came the headache and body-aches.

Sarah M.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,3,3.0,8/30/2017,"Got there around 3:15 on a Thursday afternoon, after watching a movie. Was informed that Happy Hour started at 4, so we could wait or order from the regular menu. Ordered the Truffle Cheese Sticks assuming they were going to be like cheese sticks you dip with marinara but instead got cheese paninis with bacon? Also ordered the Mini Crab Bites(6) and 2 slices of cheesecake. We got the Oreo Dream Cheesecake and the Chris's Cheesecake. Loved the crushed Oreos with the Oreo cheesecake, and the Chris's Cheesecake tasted exactly like an Almond Joy! The cheesecakes overall were good for the price, you can easily split 1 slice between 2-3 people. However, this is a 3-star review due lack of cleanliness. When I sat down, I noticed that my spoon and one of my forks were dirty. There was a large reddish/brown stain that clearly didn't get cleaned off the spoon, and white spots all over my fork. It looked like someone had just eaten from the spoon and it was put back on the table. The server exchanged my silverware for a new set, but my appetite was kind of ruined for the rest of the meal. The service was good though, she made sure to keep refilling our waters and make sure we needed anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=40

There's a lot to choose from on the menu, especially cheesecakes. The food is good. We order the Tuna Tatare. My daughter was in the mood for sushi and this is the closest they have to it. It was yummy. It was served on top of avocado and crispy wontons. We also order the avocado eggrolls. As soon as I mentioned it, the server said ""good choice."" I ordered the grilled salmon medium rare and it came out perfectly. I wasn't trying to make it come out like sushi, but usually when I order salmon from a restaurant it comes out overlooked. My husband ordered the Louisiana Chicken pasta. He wasn't impressed much, but he ate most of it. We skipped the cheesecake this time as we had to be somewhere immediately after.

The food was pretty okay nothing special the cheesecakes are pretty good ones to die for are the red velvet and smores one! For entrees if you're coming to eat come and eat the burrito! Huge dish, Shepards pie good but salty, steak Diane looked amazing and finally highly recommend the bang bang steak and chicken....  the food gets three stars, the service though gets negative points to be honest. Extremely slow service, beyond extremely slow service actually, I think we waited 15 minutes for the server to come back to us.

J Matt S.,"Tavares, FL",5,89,4,4.0,12/6/2017,"We returned here for the first time in several years. We got 3 giant slices of cheesecake to-go. The three slices we chose were: original with cherries, Oreo dream extreme, and caramel pecan. I would rank the Oreo as the best (wish I had chosen this as mine instead of caramel pecan), the original with cherries second (can't go wrong with cherry cheesecake), and caramel pecan a distant third. The caramel pecan wasn't bad, but I would suggest they tweak the way they prepare it to make it even better. (Maybe use whole pecans instead of tiny bits, add more caramel and maybe some chocolate chips). The cheesecake counter is right near the entrance, so you can get in and get out quickly. We will definitely return again when we are in the area and craving something sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=20
David M.,"Colonialtown North, Orlando, FL",17,1,,2.0,1/5/2018,"Absolute disappointment. I've eaten at many Cheesecake Factories, but I have never had such an awful experience as I had at this location. My entree, which was a chicken dish, was poorly prepared and undercooked. How is it possible that a restaurant chain known for their quality and standardization can mess up a chicken dish? I found myself spitting bits of chicken out because they were so disgusting. To top things off, the bathroom was absolutely abominable. The sink was overflowing and dripping water onto both my fur coat and the floor. What an incredible disappointment. Both the head chef and the store manager should be ashamed of themselves for such poor quality. The only redeeming part of my dining experience (and the only reason I am giving two stars) was that the server was lovely--proving old adage that Cheesecake Factory hires (and underpays for that matter) fantastic front-facing employees. I will never return to this location, and I hope you won't make the same mistake I did. Truly, a dismal restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=20
Elena S.,"Winter Park, FL",235,98,82,4.0,4/28/2017,"Went to have lunch here with my colleagues. Cheesecake factory is the ""go to"" for large groups because there is something for everyone. For appetizers, I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese balls and WOW, they were SO Yummy. It had a nice outer fried layer, not too thick, not too thin. You can still taste the mac and cheese and it came with a nice pairing of marinara sauce. For my entree, I ordered the Skinnylicous Angel hair and pasta dish. It had about 6-7 pieces of shrimp, about 2 cups of angel hair, and a nice pesto sauce. This dish was satisfying without feeling too gluttonous. However, since I wanted to feel gluttonous, I ordered a to-go box of the Snickers Cheesecake. NOW we are talking! I ate it too fast to take a picture, which is a good thing of course.   The waiter was prompt and friendly and managed our group of 13 very well. We rarely waited for refills and was able to answer the multiple questions asked by the group.  Overall, great experience.

Andrew P.,"San Pedro, CA",48,57,26,2.0,3/23/2017,"I wish I could give this location more stars... I asked my 9yo daughter where she wanted to have her birthday dinner, and Cheesecake Factory is what she wanted.  Service was average, long waits between server checking in on us.  I made sure to tell our hostess and our server that it was my daughters birthday dinner.  Quite a few birthday dinners throughout the restaurant as we heard singing and candlelit deserts walking passed us while we ate.  My kid commented that she was looking forward to a little birthday celebration as well and I told her it would come after dinner.  Portions are huge here, and we were stuffed so when the server asked us, we kindly declined.  At this point, we kinda expected them to at least bring something for the birthday girl, but we were wrong and instead just received the bill.  Her mother then slipped away from the table to ask about why our kid didn't get the same birthday treatment as everyone else, and the response was ""the other patrons bought and paid for dessert"".  I guess our drinks and dinner ($125 bill) wasn't enough for them.  He then proceeded to say ""we can do it right now if you want?"", but by then it had already gotten awkward.  I didn't feel the answer was legit so I went to their website to learned that in fact she WAS supposed to get a sundae with a candle at the least...I wonder why we were treated so differently?  Only been to the Cheesecake maybe 10x, but this was for sure the last.  Had I known, I would have bought my kid the dang dessert so she didn't feel left out...on her birthday.  I mean cmon Cheesecake Factory, that's how you want kids to feel?  1 dessert for 3 drinks/4 entrees and repeat business?  Not a smart business decision. I did reach out to the manager and he stated that it was not handled correctly.  They are sending out a gift card for a future visit as an apology as the manager can only do so much being after the fact.  But I can truly say I would have rather my kid got the birthday celebration, especially at her age.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=20

There were two types of bread and one had oatmeal, they were both soooo good; crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.   For our entries we ordered a pasta dishes and a chicken dish which I can't seem to remember the name. The pasta dishes was extremely good, we both lived it. The chicken dish was okay, chicken was a bit under season for my taste but it was moist.   For dessert we ordered 2 cheesecakes CHRIS' OUTRAGEOUS CHEESECAKE and the Tiramisu cheesecake, they were both very good and definitely the best cheesecakes I've taste. Would love to go back and taste more of their selection.

I ordered the orange chicken and my husband ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo. Both of our meals had an excellent presentation and it didn't take too long for it to be bought out too us.  I asked for additional sauce for the orange chicken as the rice was dry but it helped tremendously.   Restaurant was dimly lit and was quaint for our date night out.  Parking was a challenge as we had to circle 3 times before we found a spot.  They do have valet parking available but we just chose to look for ourself.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=20
Nancy M.,"Orlando, FL",98,145,441,4.0,12/18/2016,"This was my 2nd time here and it despite all the other reviews I read, I had a really good experience. Granted it was Sunday evening, we only had a 10 minute wait.  We ordered the calamari and the Chicken Samosa's for apps. The calamari was lightly fried and crispy. It wasn't greasy and had a good flavor. It came with cocktail and tartar sauce. The Samosa's were fried triangle pieces of well spiced chicken. It came with a cilantro sauce that was good. We ordered tempura battered fish tacos, the bacon bacon burger, the mac and cheese burger, and the Chinese chicken chopped salad. The tempura fish taco's were crisp and the fish was a good size. The order came with 3. The bacon bacon burger was huge, & had a good flavor. The mac and cheese burger seemed smaller than the bun sized bacon burger and the mac and cheese comes in a 'ball' form on top of the burger. It was alright. Again, the burger itself had a good flame grilled flavor. My Chinese chopped chicken salad was enormous and I'm not quite sure I can believe that massive bowl of yum came in at advertised 'under  590' calories. It had chopped lettuce, sesame seeds, crispy wonton, cilantro, chicken and a yummy sesame dressing.  And of course, we can't forget the cheesecake. We had vanilla bean and caramel both were good....uh it better be.

Lisa N.,"Orlando, FL",152,316,1241,3.0,5/23/2016,"After my boyfriend and I watched a movie at Regal Cinemas, we were trying to decide where to have a late dinner. Strangely, I was in the mood for pasta. Normally I wouldn't dine at The Cheesecake Factory, but it was right there and an easy choice. I don't dislike The Cheesecake Factory - it's been decent the few times I've been. But I'm basically a food snob who doesn't like going to national chain restaurants. We asked for a table outside and were seated right away. There were actually several things on the menu that caught my eye, but I decided to stick with pasta. I ordered the pasta with shrimp and sausage. While the menu does mention ""mildly spicy peppers"", the dish was much spicier than I expected. I would not describe it as mildly spicy. Despite the heat, I enjoyed the flavor so I just kept eating and didn't feel a need to send it back, although I did also think the pasta wasn't quite al dente enough. The portion size was decent. At first it seemed a bit less than what I expected for $17.95, but I did have enough leftover to make a small meal the next day. My boyfriend had the crispy Cuban rolls, and of course I got to try a bite. The wrapper was nice and crisp and overall it was a unique and tasty twist on an egg roll. He purposely ordered just an appetizer in order to save room for some cheesecake. He chose the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake. The cheesecake was not as heavy and dense as I expected, but I was still satisfied with just a bite. Service started out pretty well. The server even asked if we wanted another bread basket. But toward the end of the meal the server kind of disappeared. I think he was more focused on prep work for the next day, than checking on his customers. Despite the service, I left with a more positive impression of The Cheesecake Factory than when I went in. I wouldn't make a trip to Winter Park Village just to go there, but I'm open to going back if we're already in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=20
Jeff B.,"Longwood, FL",0,7,,1.0,8/27/2017,"Haven't been to this location in a couple of years. What was once a quality restaurant has certainly gone down hill.  Went today for lunch. Let me say I understand Sunday afternoon lunch will be busy and there will be delays and my wife and I were prepared for that. Now that said we were not prepared for the substandard service and food.  While there was almost an hour wait at 12:30 we decided to sit in the bar area. After sitting for almost 15 mins I had to flag someone down to get our waiter.  Ordered iced tea and before I could include an appetizer our server was gone. 10 minutes later iced tea shows up and before we could order our server was off to another table. 12 minutes later ( yes by this point I was timing things ) our waiter comes back and ask if we have any questions to which I answered ""we've been here over 30 minutes and except for iced tea no one has stopped by, dropped bread off or anything so we are ready to order"" We ordered an appetizer and I ordered the Chinese chicken salad without the rice noodles on top. I also asked for some bread. 12 minutes later our server walks by with 3 baskets of bread and i thought for sure one was ours but boy was i wrong. 8 minutes later I had to yell at our server to get his attention and ask for bread which showed up 5 minutes later. If you are keeping score that's 62 minutes before we even got bread.  Our meals showed up 17 minutes later. Never saw the appetizer and the server and helpers looked confused. My salad had a big pile of rice noodles but no wonton noodles. Sent it back and when it came back the rice noodles were gone but the wonton noodles were still missing. I didnt dare ask for it to be fixed.  No one seemed to care. Not the server, helper or manager.

Andrew S.,"Orlando, FL",94,25,31,4.0,11/3/2016,"Decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory in Winter Park to get some good food and we wanted to try to catch game 7 of the World Series if possible. Luckily there was one table left in the bar area by the tv showing the game. We sat down and Nicholas, our server, greeted us and took our bar order. After returning with some waters to hold us over, we ordered two appetizers; the fried macaroni and cheese and the tex mex egg rolls. Nicholas suggested the egg roll sampler but my girlfriend isn't a huge fan of salmon so we stuck with our original order.  The appetizers took a little bit to arrive but the restaurant was quite busy so that wasn't much of a surprise. Let me just say that the appetizers were DELICIOUS! The streets of heaven have to be paved with fried macaroni and cheese from the Cheesecake Factory. Its ridiculous how great they tasted. Our dinners arrived in good time and were also delicious. I tried the Chicken Madeira and my girlfriend ordered the Chicken Romano Pasta with alfredo sauce instead of tomato sauce. We had to order our cheesecake to go since we were already stuffed and as always that never disappoints.  Overall, our experience went very well. We will definitely be back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=20

NOW on to our most recent visit based on our previous experience we decided to have a birthday Sunday brunch what a mistake. The server had no business at an establishment of this caliber or any for that matter. FOOD -1  star rating, let's say Coney Island could have done better. Poached eggs where very runny no whites and in bowl of water, not just one order but both. Hair in the French toast which they quickly replaced with an order half the size and just kinda thrown on the plate. Had to continually ask the server for water, not attentive at all and it was 11:00 am so not busy yet.

I purchased a Cobb salad with no chicken and extra avocado it came out to almost $20 for one salad. It's made of lettuce predominately, some egg , cheese & not even half a tomato goes into this salad. I don't think it's worth twenty dollars at all it certainly doesn't taste like twenty dollars.This is by no means a twenty dollar salad. If you gonna charge me $20 for a salad you might as well add some ""truffle oil"" my goodness. It's not even that I won't pay $20 for a salad there wasn't even any protein in the salad I replaced  the chicken with one other serving of avocado. This is a salad I usually get when I'm trying to be conservative about money and it's a little too much for this quality of food.

Kevin H.,"Winter Park, FL",0,11,,2.0,10/25/2017,"Well, what can I say? After stopping in for a birthday dinner, on a Wednesday night, we waited an hour and a half. It was to late to go somewhere else so we stuck it out. Granted, we had a large group, seven adults and two children. I will say though, there was zero attempt to create a secondary space for us to eat. It was this table, or nothing. We were even told that the party in table was getting their dinner so it would be a little longer. Once we were sat, service was prompt to the table and drinks were ordered. Then, more waiting. I finished my drink and ordered another. Out server did mention that it was in fact a double as I had ordered, it was just in a small glass. As if I drank too much. Then, guess what? More waiting. Food was delivered in waves. Two plates came, about thirty minutes after ordering and more filtered out. They are still arriving as I type this. What food that is here, looks good. Mine is still somewhere out there. Well, that's about all I can say. Gonna try the food, I don't have to be at work until tomorrow, so we might get dessert. UPDATE: my pasta was ill described on the menu, it was not really what I expected. It also seemed to have sat in the window for quite some time. UPDATE II : The wait continues!! Ordered dessert (TO GO ) the checks have not come and neither have our deserts. I may be able to catch Kimmel if I hit the red lights just perfect. Hopefully this is that last update.

Armando G.,"Winter Garden, FL",68,215,461,4.0,7/26/2015,"I love The Cheesecake Factory.  We've dined at this location a few times and we haven't been disappointed. Just like other locations, they have (free) tasty bread, great appetizers, great entrees, delicious cheesecake and good service. Our favorite appetizers would be their Tex Mex Eggrolls, Avocado Eggrolls, Fried Mac & Cheese, Buffalo Blasts, Thai Lettuce Wraps and Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. However, last night we tried their Buffalo Chicken Meatballs and they were awesome. They were scoops of chopped buffalo-chicken which were battered, fried and served with a blue cheese dip; they were addictive.  Our favorite entrees are their Chicken Di Pana, Caramel Chicken, Orange Chicken, Spicy Cashew Chicken and the Monte Cristo Sandwich. Last night I ordered their Chicken Di Pana (tasty and large as always). We ordered their Crispy Spicy Chicken Sandwich (perfectly fried breast, pepper jack cheese topped off with buffalo sauce served on a brioche bun) with a side of blue cheese and a green salad. They absolutely know how to cook chicken; it was a perfect sandwich. We did have to ask for an extra order of buffalo sauce, but only because we like our food on the spicy side.  Dessert: Any and all cheesecakes! To be more specific, we ordered the Oreo Cheesecake last night.  It was perfect.  Our server Christina was great as well.

I split two meals with my mom: Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp. They were good to get together because the Jamaican dish is very spicy and the Bang bang dish has a cooling effect. So much flavor in both of them. Bang bang is served with rice and veggies mixed in. The Jamaican is served with rice and beans and fried plantains. Don't think the Bang bang chicken and shrimp is like Bonefish...it's totally different and has coconut.

The menu is so large its silly, the cooks are obviously over worked, the staff undertrained, and the bartender a novice. It proves yet again that corporate control over chef control is a horrible idea that needs to die.  Saddest part of the huge menu, if I could read it in the dark, is that our waiter was so slow that within that 30 minute window we had our meal choices ready. You have taken what at its core could be fine dining and chucked it in the bin. Don't lie and charge your customers for fresh food, when it clearly is not. Don't lie to your customers and blame it on corporate when Chefs and kitchen staff can strike for better control.

Priya M.,"Orlando, FL",128,92,810,4.0,12/20/2017,"So I know CF is a chain but it is one that the hubs and I love. I am kind of surprised at all the bad reviews as we've had nothing but pleasant experiences each time we've visited. This last visit was a Friday night and we were told there was a 45 minute wait (not horrible).  So we broke our evening down like this, and it worked out perfectly: We made our way to the bar and while waiting for a drink 2 people left and we were able to take their seats, score! While sipping on some wine we decided we were a little hungry and ordered 2 small plates, the dynamite shrimp and crab cake bites. Both were delicious and perfect size for just us two! Shortly after finishing our appetizers our buzzer went off and our table was ready! Our waitress was sweet and attentive. My husband ordered the pasta Alfredo with chicken on the side (he's just picky like that) and I ordered the crispy chicken costoletta with sautéed spinach and mashed potatoes. We didn't really need to but who can resist their delicious bread?? By the time we finished our entrees came out. My husband loved his pasta! I was amazed that my dish came with 3 pieces of chicken -- holy leftovers! The lemon butter sauce was delicious so of course I had to ask for more to accompany my chicken (as well as to take home).  So by this time you're probably thinking how could we eat any more?? But yes we had to share a slice of cheesecake. Now remember, their small plates aren't that heavy so you can get that, eat 1/4-1/2 of your dinner, and still get dessert (shoot I had a couple bites and had to take the rest home). They were running a little low on choices however they had their Celebration cheesecake which was PERFECT for me! It had just the right amount of cheesecake, vanilla cake, and mousse in it. So yummy!  We will definitely be back to visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park

So we get there and there was already a long line of guests waiting to be attended and seated which is usually expected because of this location's popularity. We checked in and waited easily over an hour to be seated and attended to which is not great when it's a birthday party situation. Even when we were finally seated the timing of the service was off. That would be the main and most important issue with this visit especially since we saved our appetite for this place. I had the macaroni with cheese and it lacked cheese and flavor, everyone else at the table liked their dish for the most part. On the bright side everything was fresh. In conclusion the only bad thing I can say was the waiting time on every aspect of the experience, other than that everything else was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park

I don't know, the ridiculously complex menu, the faux-Egyptian decor, the bread basket (#brownbread4lyfe)...the whole experience is slightly surreal and makes me ridiculously happy! Going to The Cheesecake Factory isn't just a meal, it's an event! Anyway, my love for TCF aside I am sad to report that this location isn't the best. It's definitely less crowded than other outposts (particularly the one at Millennia which is just bonkers 24/7), so that's a plus. Staff is generally nice, but the attention to detail just isn't there. Part of the charm(?) of TCF is that the food should be consistent and pretty high quality every time, but it seems like orders always come out slightly off: cold fries, forgot the cheese, gave my friend's steak to someone else. Once we asked for the bread basket to be all brown bread and they brought us all sourdough. I mean, they could have just said ""no"".... I will always love and adore The Cheesecake Factory and will surely be back here, but it's hard to deny there is some room for improvement.

They have quick sit down service unless you choose to get in sooner and sit at the high tops or bar area, woo!!! Secret secret ?? Those are always sit down anywhere you like and gives you better and faster service.

Chris A.,"Orlando, FL",221,198,561,4.0,10/16/2017,"So we had some time to kill before a movie, and we saw that the Cheesecake Factory has a decent happy hour menu, so we decide to check it out. We get there, sit in the bar area, and are greeted by our server. I get a Coke Zero because I was dragging and needed caffeine. My girlfriend gets a fancy drink. I forget which one, but she said it was good.  We think that ordering three appetizers to split between the two of us was going to be fine, and it was fine, but it was more than fine. Meaning, these $6 appetizers were actually much, much larger than we expected them to be. It was a pleasant surprise, don't get me wrong. We just had to scarf it all down, because we didn't want to leave leftovers in the car during the movie. More of a me problem. Let's get to the food. From worst to first. When I say worst, nothing was actually bad here. It was all pretty great. Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip (A Delicious Blend of Crab, Artichokes and Cheese. Served Warn with Grilled Bread). Wow. This was so crabby. They didn't skimp on it in this dish. Every bite was super flavorful and creamy. I have a tip, though. Save some of that complimentary bread from the beginning of your meal, because they definitely don't give you enough grilled bread to make the dip last. Then, the ""Happy Hour Burger"" (Double Patties, Double Cheese, Grilled Onions and Special Sauce on a Toasted Brioche Bun). This thing was shockingly large. This is a burger I would pay $12 for at Burger U. Here, it was $6. Crazy. It was actually cooked nicely, too. Not dry or anything. I didn't notice anything truly special about the sauce. Also, the bun is brioche, so it might be a little oily for some people's tastes, but I didn't mind.  The best thing that we ate, hands down, was the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders (Crispy Fried Chicken Breast on Mini-Buns. Served with Lettuce, Tomato and Pickles). The sides are served on the side, so you get to build your own sliders. It also comes with two sauces, a tangy thousand island-type sauce and mayo. The chicken was cooked so well. SO well. It was nice and crispy on the outside, and there was actually enough meat on the insider for me to tell that it was nice and juicy. That's not something I'm used to from chicken sliders.  Overall, this was a great meal for an even better price. I know this place has a reputation for being overpriced and overly unhealthy, but gosh darn it, I enjoyed myself, and I will be back, for happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park

Unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory is a nationwide restaurant and the service can be hit or miss. At this location it has also been a hit or miss.  The hostesses are usually very nice and I have had an array of different servers. This time we had Christina and she was marvelous! They give you delicious bread, white and a the sweet brown bread which is my favorite!  Usually when you go at night time within two hours of closing I notice the service to be less than par and it is super packed! They also do not take reservations so you can be waiting for over an hour.  I recommend going for lunch time. The staff is more lively and and the food seems more fresh. The prices are reasonable for a date night or going out with your friends. The dress is casual or dressy casual.  I order the same meal everytime I go the ""Crusted Chicken Romano"" and I LOVE IT  and it is consistently good everytime. Try the mango strawberry drink, I forgot what it's called but it is sooo good and taste just like mango! And of course I have to talk about the cheesecake! Yes it is amazing and delicious goodness! My favorites are the strawberry, banana cream and Oreo. There are so many flavors and they are huge servings. Their whipped cream is the best I've ever had.

Our waiter (Jennifer) came to our table got our drinks, appetizers and dinner because we already knew what we wanted. She came with 5 baskets of bread (delicious bread) and she also brought the whole table cups of waters. The appetizers came in (fried Mac n cheese) (guacamole egrolls) and ( chips with guacamole) my favorite was the fried Mac n cheese it was just like WOW delicious a must try. I had the veggie burger which was ok I will definitely try something different next time I go. Overall they have a very good menu covering vegetarians as well as meat eaters.

Chrissie B.,"Winter Park, FL",18,127,227,5.0,8/3/2017,Mmm...cheesecake factory! So many options. So many cheesecakes. How can one not like this place? I went for lunch today with work colleagues. I was able go get a table quickly. The waiter was attentive and helpful. I had the Louisiana Chicken pasta which was delicious. I have probably had all of their pastas in my lifetime. Certainly recommend the Crusted Chicken Romano as one of my favorites. I love the complementary bread also. My favorite cheesecake is probably the 30th anniversary. But i love all the chocolate ones. This location gets crazy packed on the weekends so be prepared for that. I have heard that evenings are also very busy. There is a lot of parking but even with that it is often difficult to find a parking spot. It is certainly worth it though.

Elise C.,"Oviedo, FL",106,120,236,4.0,12/10/2016,"This is a hit-or-miss place, but I did get a hit this time! I ordered the Monte Cristo Sandwich from the brunch menu. Having only had a Monte Cristo once before (no idea when or where) and recalling that I liked it, my fingers were crossed. It was awesome. And filling: between the french toast, the eggs, the meats, and the cheeses (forget the potatoes, I took those home for later), I was quite literally stuffed. I usually don't like sweet/savory combos, but this sandwich is one for which my tongue does cartwheels of excitement. The powdered sugar and strawberry preserves top it all off beautifully. For others at my table, food was so-so, and I have had that experience myself a few times; combined with the highish-but-normal-for-this-type-of-place prices, the Factory is an infrequent place on my list. The ambiance is fun, though--I feel like I'm at a fancy Disney restaurant because of the size and the themed styling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park

The last time I went we had the lettuce wraps, filet mignon (medium rare) and the garlic noodle with shrimp. The lettuce wraps were decent, but the filet mignon came out more of a well done - didn't bother sending it back as it took so long getting out. Also, the green beans side was extremely salty and difficult to eat by itself. Finally, the garlic noodles with shrimp would have been great except for that fact that the shrimp was overcooked. Won't be back unless someone decides to have their birthday there and I have no choice.

Casey B.,"DeLand, FL",0,22,10,1.0,8/27/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants and we always make it a point to stop in when we are nearby. My wife and I visited this location for the first time on Saturday.  The facility was clean and in a newer shopping area.   When we got our appetizer the avocados were not ripe at all and the dipping sauce was extremely watered down.  The salt shakers at all the tables nearby were completely clogged, which they said they knew it was humidity and never brought us a new one.   My wife's lettuce wraps were made with aging vegetables.  The lettuce and bean sprouts were turning brown.  The cucumbers were almost translucent and wilted .  It would have been edible, but clearly not what you would expect to be served at an upscale restaurant.  She asked it be returned and just have something else. I ordered the classic cheeseburger and my lettuce was more cabbage than lettuce, so I asked the waiter about it and had they include cabbage in the lettuce blend.  Instead of offering to get me lettuce he argued with me about and walked away rolling his eyes.  Seriously though who wants raw cabbage on your cheeseburger.  Since I still had the menu it said it comes with lettuce, not a lettuce ""blend.""  I basically didn't eat my burger because it was so greasy. The manager came to our table since we had returned a dish out of what felt like obligation.  I explained we had come here for our anniversary and were overall disappointed in our experience.  He gave lip service and then disappeared.   I paid my bill (no discounts) and did not order dessert, which was the main reason we had come.  I would never eat at this branch again and I would advise anyone reading this to do the same.  There is a better branch not much farther away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park
Edmond L.,"Orlando, FL",23,180,373,3.0,1/9/2017,"Orlando has been hit with some cold weather lately, 30's overnight and high in the 40's or low 50's during the day.  That means it's okay for businesses to taper down the AC on when weather turns like that. It was not okay for Cheesecake Factory last night. It was cold in there.  Only difference between being there and being outside was the windchill.  Other diners were cold judging by the number of people who had left their jackets on.  I left my jacket on, we put her jacket back on our daughter.  This made for a less than stellar dining experience.  Told our server, she said she didn't feel cold as she was always on the move.  That does not help the situation your diners are in at all.  No offer to let management know or do anything about the cold dining room. Before we ordered, our server scored some solid points by bringing out a separate bread and banana dish for our 1.5 year old.  We didn't ask, she just did it.  In speaking with her, she said she had a couple of young children herself and though that might be a way to have the child enjoy the dining experience.  It did help a lot. I ordered the meatloaf and my wife ordered a chicken pasta dish.  Plates came out in about 15 minutes, not too long of a wait, they were somewhat busy last night.  We waited for our table for about 15 minutes or so. I enjoyed my meatloaf with mashed potatoes and corn succotash.  The gravy is a brown gravy instead of a tomato based sauce.  It's one of my favorite meals from Cheesecake Factory. Wife enjoyed her dish as well but the portions were a bit small.  My portion was quite large, so large in fact that I had about 1/4 of the meatloaf left which I brought home. We finished our meal off with strawberry topped cheesecake, it's our favorite and I believe one of their best sellers.  The server brought some ice cream with chocolate syrup and sprinkles for our little one.  Again, we didn't ask, it's just something she did and it was greatly appreciated. To summarize, we wish something was done about the temperature.  The actions of our server boosted the rating to 3 stars.  Otherwise it would've been 2 stars.  5 stars is reserved for the places with a combination of incredible food, incredible service and an incredible atmosphere.  This place has potential but it didn't meet it this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park

I ordered the daily special.  It was ""wild"" farmed salmon.  Let's face it, either something is wild or it is farmed, it can't be both.  The salmon was ok.  It was prepared with mushrooms and capers and accompanied by the largest scoop of mashed potatoes I've ever seen on a plate.  I figured the reason for the large quantity of potatoes was so the plate wouldn't look empty.  I had substituted my broccoli for a side salad which came on a separate plate.  All the food was ok, nothing special. My one friend ordered shrimp scampi.  I think the picture speaks for itself. Another friend ordered a hamburger.  While the meal was good, it arrived at te table a full 5 minutes after everyone else was served their meals.  Poor timing. The restaurant was clean enough.  The servers were polite and pleasant.  And ... it was a minor miracle that we didn't have to wait 20 to 30 minutes to be seated.  Since I've been going to Cheesecake I've never been seated immediately even when the place was empty!  We arrived about 4:30pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park

Awesome deal for appetizers, drinks are still like $5something which isn't terrible, but also not necessarily great in my opinion.

I ordered the chicken teriyaki which comes with your choice of brown rice/white rice. The only good thing in this dish was the chicken. The rice had no taste/flavor it was pretty much bland. The other positive thing is that the portions are big. You can't go to the cheesecake factory without having dessert. I picked the Lemon meringue cheesecake. It was delicious. The service was not that great either. It was not that busy. Half of our table got their drinks while the other half was waiting on water..(yes water).

Our waitress comes out asking if she can get us soups or salads for free because the kitchen was super behind and it was probably going to be another 25-30 mins before our food got to us.

Elisa R.,"Orlando, FL",240,140,172,2.0,9/4/2016,"Never again!!!!! Not only was the food awful, but it took forever to come. I ordered the chicken waffle and Benedict from their brunch menu. I never thought you could mess something up so simple like a waffle, but oh they did. It was super soggy by the time I got the dish and the taste was nothing like a waffle but rather a donut taste. It was way too sweet for the overall meal. Then the chicken! No not your delicious fried chicken that you normally get with waffle and chickens, instead it was chicken strips with breading that once again was soggy, not crispy at all and tasted like a frozen chicken strip you buy from the frozen section at publix. The hollandaise sauce on the poached eggs was equally awful. Overall do not recommend this dish to anyone- even though when I ordered it my waiter said ""oh that's a great choice""- not sure why he would need to lie. My husband had the beef tip sandwich and didn't even finish it. When my husband leaves food on a plate, that's an immediate sign that the food is not worth it since he normally eats anything and always has a huge appetite. I think I am starting to realize that my palate has changed and it can immediately detect frozen already prepared meals compared to the fresh, scratch meals I'm used to from all the amazing mom and pop restaurants in the area.

With all of the great local restaurants in Orlando, why would someone eat here?  I understand the excitement created by the name but at the end of the day, who has any room in their stomach for cheesecake after the ginormous meals their serve here?!  However, my hubby requested it for lunch so I was willing to go and give it a chance yet again. The theme here seems to be ""bigger is better.""  The menu is ridiculously overwhelming and there is really no organization as the lunch specials are towards the end. And I think the ads in the menu are super duper tacky!  Food was ok. We were brought out a complimentary basket of bread and butter. Our tex mex eggrolls were good. I enjoyed the pico de gallo that I used as a topping to give it that ""kick"" it needed. My chicken salad sandwich was insanely huge. And I was let down that it was more of a pressed sandwich on Texas type toast . Blergh. I probably ate a few bites of one HALF before giving up. The buttered toast with the creaminess of the chicken salad was just too rich and it was too much all at once.  My husband had the California cheesesteak and it was smaller than my entire meal! I did enjoy his Flying Gorilla cocktail. If you are going to drink your calories, this is a good way to start. Think chocolate, banana, whipped cream, alcohol. Yumm! Service was good. Our server was attentive and did his duties but more in a robotic way. He had no personality ,which in this establishment is what sets you apart.  It was definitely all business.  In a nutshell, I wouldn't discourage anyone from coming here. It's not the worst place in the world but just not where I would choose to spend my hard earned $$.

Hard to complain when everything is marinated in butter. Maybe it seems like I want to complain. I do. Chain restaurants displease me for all their sterile homogeneity. This Applebees is no different.  This Yard House seems to go for high-brow atmosphere at $$ (the high end of $$) prices. Though the decor is tacky, who the fuck really cares? TGIFridays was absolutely crawling with employees. Must have been 30 in that place for lunch. Even so, we were saying ""where's the guy"" a lot.

My husband got a personal pizza and salad ($13 lunch special) and I got their spicy chicken chipotle pasta ($16 for the dinner portion). I love how they give you the option to pay a little bit less for a lunch sized portion, but I usually order the dinner size and take the rest to go for another meal later because I love leftovers. Honestly...most times at the cheesecake factory, I never order cheesecake because it's a little pricey for just one slice, but I'm sure it's very gpod. I wanted to today, but was so full after the food because of the big portions that I couldn't even imagine eating anything else. We opted for drinks with our lunches instead of an appetizer and the hubby ordered a Caribbean Cooler and I ordered the Flying Gorilla (under blended drinks section). No price on the drinks...but be aware they ran $11 a pop. Don't feel the price was worth it for my husband's drink because it was small, but I love the flying gorrilla which was dark chocolate liquer and banana...so delicious and they give you lots!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=100

Lesley O.,"East Meadow, NY",1445,604,1483,4.0,7/10/2015,"The ambiance at The Cheesecake Factory is lovely & the restaurant runs like a well oiled machine. At this particular location, it was not busy when we arrived at about 6pm but by the time we left at 7:30, there was probably a 10-20 minute wait. All of the bussers, servers, & food runners  truly worked as a team & that was nice to see. The bussers help the servers pre-bus the table & when a table got up, the bussers were there to clear the table, clean it, & set it immediately. The server we had, Will, was very personable & took great care of my grandfather & myself. I ordered the Miso Salmon & got macaroni & cheese instead of white rice because it was a cheat day!! The fish was cooked perfectly & the macaroni & cheese was sooo good because it's the perfect combination of cheesy & had a great crust on top. The sauce for the fish which is sake butter & miso glaze was definitely not the flavor profile it should've been though & it tasted completely off. My grandfather ordered the Fried Catfish & it was served with mashed potatoes, green beans, & giblets of corn. The sauce it came with was a spicy tartar, perhaps some type remounted even & it was nice but too spicy for my grad father but he loved the fish & the mashed potatoes. My grandfather always goes out to eat & orders a dry Rob Roy with a twist of lemon & it's pretty much NEVER accurate, but by some miracle...it was perfect!!! We were too full for dessert so we didn't order any, but I have had every single cheesecake over the years & I have many that I love but I'd say my top 5 are: Chocolate Tuxedo Cream, White Chocolate Raspberry (I don't even like white chocolate & it's that good), Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple, Godiva, & Lemon Raspberry Cream. Don't get me wrong though, the Dulce de Leche with bits of almond toffee  on the whipped cream, Banana Cream, & Pumpkin when it's in season are damn good! If you're not a cheesecake fan & want another dessert, I highly recommend the Linda's Fudge Cake if you're a chocolate lover, the Tiramisu if you love coffee, & the Strawberry Shortcake if you want something a little lighter but absolute perfection!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=100
Brian M.,"Apopka, FL",211,360,93,3.0,12/10/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is the epitome  of ""safe choice"" to me.  You know going in that the food will be on the better side of average, the restaurant will be clean, and typically the service is good.  I have my favorites here (chicken madeira, lettuce wraps), but most anything I have tried on the menu is good.  The bread at the beginning is a nice touch as well.  I can't really vouch for the cheesecake, as I don't like cheesecake, but I always here it is great from my wife.  I love that they are so clean, something basic a restaurant can do to really ensure that the diners have a good experience.   The plus and the minus here really revolves around menu size.  I can see the benefits of choice, but that menu is just way too big.  You really get the sense that they could elevate their food if they were to shave off some of the excess that is in that menu.  The other thing I would love to see would be a bit more separation in the seating areas.  At times, you can feel like you are almost dining with your neighbor.

Our Sunday lunch for 4 people took nearly 2 hours, and we did not have an appetizer or dessert. The meals came out one at a time, with the last one coming nearly 45 minutes after we were seated. To her credit, the server checked several times and told us it was coming out soon, but then came to tell us that apparently it was sent to another table. The food was OK, but we will not be back.

Thysis R.,"Orlando, FL",182,238,734,4.0,5/25/2014,We visited this location to celebrate my Goddaughters graduation. We had a party of 12 and had to wait for about an hour and a half. Reason being is because they weren't accepting reservations.  We were finally seated and greeted by our waiter who appeared to have a lot of enthusiasm. He quickly took our drink orders and asked if we wanted appetizers. We declined appetizers but asked for a couple of bread baskets. I have to say that their honey wheat bread seemed to be the favorite for everyone.  I ended up getting a blueberry Mojito which was quite tasty. I will say I'm usually not a fan of Cheesecake Factory because I feel totally overwhelmed with their menu but they make a great Mojito. I ended up ordering the fried MacNCheese balls with marinara sauce. I only wanted something small at this point since we were seated a little late in the evening.  My order came out and it was 4 perfectly fried balls of MacNCheese. They were so good! The inside was creamy and not too overpowering. I have to say it was a really nice combination of cheeses that went very well with the marinara sauce. I was only able to eat 2 of them as I was pretty full.  I opted out on the best part...cheesecake but one of my friends got the cherry cheesecake. Yes I did take a bite and it was delicious. All I needed was just a couple of bites and I was happy.

The food came quickly and every possible need and request met with a fluid efficiency one seldom sees anymore.  The food came to our table freshly plated hot and attractively arranged.

Green beans were awesome, maybe a quick shallow fry in the oil, yum! Sweet potato fries were nicely arranged, but were too sweet for my tastes.

Digital B.,"Longwood, FL",17,351,62,1.0,1/1/2014,"I used to love eating here until I had one of my supervisors bring me back a meal to the office for me. I was working late and they got me a chicken dish with potatoes and some other veggies. While I was eating I crunched down on to something hard. When I pulled it out of my mouth it looked like a small pebble or a broken chunk of glass (tempered). I checked my tooth, which was hurting really bad, and it had chipped (yes, I later went to the dentist, but that wasn't the issue really - see below). I called my boss in and showed him but he just shrugged his shoulders and told me to call the company. I called them that evening and I spoke to the manager who directed me to a number in California. This was my first sign that there was a problem because the manager should have just offered me a gift card or a free meal but it only made things worse. I called the number given to me the next day and got some ""high as a kite"" executive who was literally driving down the California coast in a convertible. I could hardly hear her but she insisted that she would help me and that I needed to send the ""pebble"" to her. I took down her address and she said that she would send me a couple of coupons for me and my family. She told me that it wasn't unheard of to have a potato grow around a pebble (???). I never heard of this and I must say in all the years of eating potatoes I've never had this issue. Needless to say I sent off the pebble and never heard back from her. I tried to call the same number several times but with caller ID she was obviously screening her calls. Good for her. She did her job for the corporation, but lost an entire family of previous followers. To be honest, it was the way I was treated which pissed me off.

For an appetizer we ordered some type of garlic bread. My fiancé ordered a chicken Alfredo pasta, which he said had a hint of ham in it, but it tasted fine to me. I ordered Rene's special and it was, as usual, fantastic. I was thrown slightly over the soup of the day which was some kind of vegetable tortilla soup or something of the sort and it was actually fantastic. The turkey sandwich was wonderfull. The ceasar salad was also very good. Not too heavy on the dressing. My fiancé ordered a coors light beer and I had ordered the Georgia peach cocktail which was phenomenal !!

The plan was to split the meal between my sister and I, we split the meal regardless of the small portion, on the first bite we realized the rice was literally uncooked. We waited and waited and waited for the waiter to come, nothing. My sister took 2 bites of her chicken waiting because we were starving. Finally we flag down the waiter and tell him, he goes to grab a manager and she comes and rudely says that she'll bring rice. I commented that at this point my chicken is ice cold and id like a new meal. She rudely exclaimed that she couldn't do that because my sister ate her chicken. Then I said ok can you remove the meal from the check and she again rudely exclaimed that the only thing she could do is bring rice or compensate with a cheesecake. Hands down the absolute worse experience I've ever had at a Resteraunt. $18 for a cup of uncooked rice,a tiny piece of cold chicken, and a rude manager is what you'll get here.

Our food came out and my order was wrong. The waiter brought out a grilled cheese sandwich with chicken cut up in it and tried to convince me that it was what I had ordered, but I told him no and sent it back. I ate the salad though and the lettuce left a very bitter taste in my mouth...blech, was not good. My moms omelette literally had almost a whole onion in it and the potatoes were burnt to a crisp.

We dined here for dinner prior to a movie and decided to go with several small plates. We tried the ahi tuna, margarita pizza, crab and artichoke dip, fried artichoke hearts and fried potstickers. I think the favorite was the ahi, believe it or not. It was a nice cool app with a blend of ahi and avocado that went nicely with the accompanying crunchy pita wedges.  Service was good and our server was efficient and had a relaxed, friendly manner. Drinks were pretty weak. My blueberry mojito gets points for having real blueberries in it but was not only weak but was filled to the brim with ice. I also tried the strawberry martini which was good but not strong like promised. (I wasn't trying to get blitzed but I couldn't taste alcohol in either drink!) Usually when we eat here we get the same cheesecake, the white chocolate raspberry truffle. But this time we were swayed into getting the red velvet. Although it was good (what cheesecake here isn't??) I wish we'd gotten the raspberry truffle.

We had the cuban egg rolls for an appetizer. They were okay, there wasn't a lot of the pork in them and they were a little greasy, the dipping sauce was just okay and kind of non descript. My wife had the shepherd's pie which was okay. with decent flavor, but the pieces of beef were kind of tough and slightly overcooked. I tried the stuffed tamales which were kind of cold with slightly overcooked chicken and too sweet black beans and too sweet corn cakes. So, overall, the food quality has kind of gone down a little, unless it was just the choices we happened to make. Service was pretty good even though they were pretty busy.

If that's not bad enough, we had to wait another hour to get our food.  We didn't get out of there until almost 11:00 PM.   I emailed their headquarters about my experience, and they sent me a gift card for $10.  Yeah, like I can really buy anything from The Cheesecake Factory with $10.  What, a slice of cheesecake or a drink?  I want an actual meal. Like I said, I don't think I'll be back.  Not to this location, anyway.  I've heard the Mall at Millenia location isn't any better when it comes to waiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=140
Sydney K.,"Orlando, FL",112,293,43,3.0,4/2/2013,"So, it's your standard Cheesecake Factory. My experiences here have overall been positive, but when it's bad, it's bad. So, I'm not really sure how to review the Cheesecake Factory, but what I can say is it's what you'd expect from this establishment. Long waits for dinner, especially on Friday or Saturday nights, decor that seems like a Rococo mess, and tasty food that may or may not be a heart attack waiting to happen. The good: Overall my experiences with the employees here have been positive. There was this one woman who didn't like the fact that my group was there for dessert only and proceeded to almost attack one of our party with the cheesecake (it had a rough landing), but I don't think she's there anymore. I like the lighter choices menu because you still get tasty food but at a lesser cost to your health. I really love the beet and goat cheese salad, but recently there has been less deliciousness on the plate. I also like the blue cheese flatbread and the turkey burger, but it seems that most things on that menu are a good choice. The cheesecake is pretty good, though I'm a bit of a purist with my cheesecake tastes. It can also be pretty pricey as a slice goes for $7-8. Still, one slice is enough for 3 or 4 people to split if you're feeling thrifty. They also don't make their cheesecake there from what I understand, so I'm disappointed in that. The bad: The calorie counts can be absurd. I know this can be true anywhere, but how do you fit 2000 calories into a shrimp sandwich?! I definitely recommend checking the nutrition info before you go, or at least try to order off the lighter menu if you're trying to be health conscious. The wait can easily hit an hour at peak times, which I know isn't a lot compared to some places. Still, I feel like that's a long time to wait for the Cheesecake Factory. Once you're seated the lights are usually quite dim and the noise can be quite loud. Not exactly my type of place (I like to see my food and dining companions personally), but that in and of itself isn't a bad thing. Long story short, it's Cheesecake Factory, you get what you know you're getting. I prefer patronizing local businesses when I can, but there's nothing wrong with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=140

Jackie S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",28,325,329,2.0,5/12/2013,"Oh Cheesecake Factory - what are you doing and why are you doing it wrong?! It was my in-laws anniversary and my mother in law decided, lets go to the Cheesecake Factory. We arrived at around 6pm and the wait time was 40 minutes, which, I'm sure is reasonable for a Saturday night. With only having 4 people in our party, we were unable to make a reservation, which, is okay too.  When we got seated we were promptly greeted by our server, Cesar, who started out great but then as the evening progressed, he became evenless attentive, making the first experience of my father in law, not so great. Issue 1 - my father in law ordered the Herb Encrusted Filet of Salmon. The menu is not lying - the salmon is encrusted in so much parsley that you can't see a hint of pink only green. He compared the salmon to a field of grass that needed to be mowed. He said that the mashed potatoes were very sweet and the asparagus was not cooked thoroughly (still tough and not tender). The salmon is served on top of a lemon sauce which soaked into the mashed potatoes and turned them into soup.  Issue was rectified by him ordering a boring Club sandwich. Issue 2 - my hubs ordered the Grilled Pork Chop which was accompanied with mashed potatoes, broccoli, and apple sauce, along with an unknown gravy that was poured over everything. The apple sauce wasn't strained prior to being placed on the plate and the excess juice from the apple sauce mixed into the mashed potatoes making them overly sweet. He was able to pour the water/sauce/gravy into the dish that they brought us the butter in.  Issue was rectified by him ordering the tried and true, Louisiana Chicken pasta. We each ordered a Caesar side salad which was delicious. My mother in law ordered the Fettucini with Chicken and Sundried Tomatoes (the only dish she's willing to try) and I ordered my usual (Louisiana Chicken Pasta).  For dessert, I ordered the Lemon Raspberry cheesecake which was amazing (nuff said). It had the perfect blend of being sweet yet tangy at the same time. Its a combination of cheesecake with lady fingers, mousse, and cake.  FYI - the later in the evening, the dimmer the lighting in the dining areas. So, if you have a hard time seeing, try to go before 7:30pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=120

Potatoes were almost cold.  I ordered chicken fettuccine Alfredo, which, according to the menu, has a creamy sauce.  I was unfortunately very disappointed with this dish.  I would prefer Fazoli's fettuccine Alfredo over this.  I had to add salt to it twice because it had no flavor at all, and the sauce was anything but creamy, it was barely there.  I felt like I paid $19 for some plain boiled noodles.  I had the same dish at Bella Italia last night, and Cheesecake Factory should go try their Alfredo to learn what the word ""creamy"" means.  I didn't bother sending the dish back or complaining about it.  It was at least edible once I salted it, I didn't know if I might get something worse picking from other dishes on the menu, and I didn't want to wait again for a new dish.  I would still try this restaurant again, but I'd like some suggestions as to what's good, so I know what to get and what to avoid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=120

We were sandwiched between two other tables (very European bistro style). It was a little uncomfortable. The main dining room (there's another space off to the side) was very noisy and dim - a double whammy. I couldn't see to read the voluminous menu, and couldn't hear my dining companion tell me what was on it. Speaking of the menu, for the few who haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory before, the menu is the length of a small book. They serve a variety of cuisine (Italian, Mexican, Chinese, American, etc.) in jumbo-sized portions. The food is good, for large chain fare. We had two different pasta dishes, both were fine.

We ordered the fried calamari, (which is always a fav) and ordered the Wasabi Crusted Tuna and the Chicken Bellagio as our entrees.  I absolutely loved my bf's dish with the Chicken Bellagio as it has some fried chicken with shaved ham and cheese on a bed basil pasta. Completely refreshing and light meal. My dish on the other hand was the Wasabi Crusted Tuna on a bed of white rice with miso sauce. It sounded good.. and I was trying to steer away from getting what I have eaten before and thought this would be a perfect new dish. It wasn't what I expected.

Po T.,"Taipei, Taiwan",26,63,91,4.0,11/20/2010,"We went there tonight for wife's birthday dinner and we have not been here for a while but not much has changed. Still lots of people were waiting at the lobby for tables. I like their food, lots of selections with their advertisement laced menu, and the large selections of cheesecakes.  I noticed the snack section of the menu of smaller portion appetizers. I picked out Ahi Tartar and Vietnamese Tacos. The tuna tartar portion was small but tasted good with the sauce on top and the avocado at the bottom. Even my wife liked it more than our favorite Tuna Roll which we also got as well.  Vietnamese Tacos reminded me of the Taiwanese Tacos of similar steamed white buns with roasted pork in the middle.  It came with 3 on the plate and I ate them mostly myself (yum), no one dared to try except my brave and thankfully wide taste-buds daughter (only 7). Don't forget about the free breads they offered which we liked. Two different breads (sourdough and wheat I think) in the basket with the spreadable butter made it a tasty treats before meals even without any appetizers. I had the grilled pork chops and it tasted good with the fresh baked spinach and extremely large portion of the mashed potato turret which was also good. In the past I always ordered something with seafood but I'll eat just about anything.  Wife had her usual fav Chicken Marsala and my sister in-law had the Bam Bam chicken and shrimps which was only okay for her (I tried it and it tasted like curry with coconut shaving on top, pretty good for me).  We were so stuffed and had to get the cheesecakes to go. Overall it's a great restaurant with great food of large portion (always bring home leftovers) and great atmosphere for special occasions.   Valet parking is available but the parking lot next to it has plenty of parking if you have the patience to wait just a bit.

My last two experiences have not been very good, though. I worry that this location is going downhill. Came with my boyfriend a couple weeks ago. We were tucked away in a weird area if the restaurant, but we didn't complain. Waitress was not very attentive. Maybe because we were seated in such a weird area she just forgot about us. Took her a long time to take our order and bring us bread. I got a skinny flatbread which was very good. Boyfriend got chicken and biscuits, which is normally one of our favorites. They were out of mashed potatoes so he agreed to breakfast potatoes, which were literally the worst breakfast potatoes either of us have ever had. Dry, way way oversalted, and not hot.

There's so many other flavors out there! They don't skimp on the portions either, and the cheesecake was no exception.

Loved the Cheesecake Factory in the past and we were excited to return, but after our experience tonight I am done! So the wait was more than an hour and a half which I expected for Valentines Day, but then I inquired about the bar tables. The  server said we could eat at the high top tables on a first come first serve basis. Everyone ahead of us was very respectful and as tables became available, we sat in the order in which we arrived, but then a young family decided they were going to sit at the next table ahead of those that had been waiting. Needless to say there was a verbal altercation. What was very disappointing, was that the waiter, Louis, got involved and stated ""I get to choose who sits where"" and accommodated the rude couple ahead of those of us who were waiting. Thank goodness the manager stepped in and straightened things out. From there, the visit went down hill. The food was mediocre and our waiter was rude! His name was Tony. Truly a disappointing visit.

That being said our waiter, Tony, is probably the most arrogant person I have ever had wait on me. My Cheesecake Factory experience has been completely ruined by him. Not only did I receive a few eye rolls but also some serious attitude just from asking a few simple questions. But hey he's obviously trying to work towards a zero dollar tip. He has completely ruined my families Valentine's Day dinner and if I was management I would get rid of this employee asap because he's pushing away paying customers.

I ordered the Mexican taco salad, and it was pretty good.  A huge portion, mostly make up of those little crispy tortilla strips.  The avacado dressing was very tasty.  Could have used more chicken.

Catherine M.,"De Bary, FL",17,34,,4.0,4/15/2013,"What's not to Yum About? After a long hot day at Disney World, we left and wanted a restaurant that we knew would not cost us a small fortune with consistently good food. So, we decided to visit the Cheesecake Factory in Winter Park. And we were not disappointed. The four of us had a wonderful meal making our experience an A-1 day. Our server brought some tasty homemade bread that came directly from the oven. As others have mentioned, the menu is extensive with so many choices. It took us a while to make a decision.  I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp (note although the menu says spicy; it was not) and the rest of the family ordered the Chicken Di Pano, the Skinnylicious Spicy Chicken salad and the New Orleans Shrimp. Each meal was delicious and portions sizable, with the exception of the New Orleans Shrimp. The New Orleans Shrimp portion was much smaller than all the other dinners. We were all satisfied. I am not sure if it possible to come to this restaurant and not order cheesecake, is it? We ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake and the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake. I am not much of a sweets person, but I did taste each. I first tried the Ultimate. It was yummy with a cream cheese frosting and shaved white chocolate covering the sides. However, the Reese's cheesecake was no doubt the best dessert I have ever had. OMG! If you like chocolate and peanut butter, this is a MUST try. Our server was great and friendly. The only criticism I have is the floors were very slick. It was raining that day. Their shiny tile floors and rain do not really work well together.

My Mom and I ordered the calamari appetizer to share, it was a few dollars more than other restaurants but tasted the same as other places (EXACTLY THE SAME) and was the same portion size. We also ordered drinks which were good, however I noticed a man down the table and I both ordered pina coladas, but he had a larger glass and strawberry, cherry, and pineapple around his cup whereas they gave me a smaller glass with only cherry and pineapple even though we were presumably paying the same price. I did not appreciate the inconsistency. I also noticed that they didn't ID me, something every other restaurant has done, thanks for saving me the inconvenience of pulling out my ID, but I guess it's on them if I'm underage (I'm not).  Moving on to the main course, chicken madeira. It was delicious and for $15.95 it was a large portion size. I ordered mashed potatoes with mine. I had an issue with the MASHED potatoes because they weren't really MASHED. There was large chunks of potato inside the mashed potatoes and they were really thick. They had good flavor though. After dinner, we ordered a delicious and fair priced key lime cheesecake to share. It was really nice and the key lime covered up the sweetness of the cheesecake. Our service was okay, however being a large group we had two servers. When we got our bill they had already added in the 18% tip which we felt was unfair because none of the servers deserved an 18% tip in our opinion and we didn't really even know who we were tipping.

Bernadette M.,"Grand Junction, CO",23,20,,1.0,6/9/2006,"I do not understand the fascination with this restaurant. I have been here on a number of occasions, as well as their location in Milena and I simply do not understand it. It takes forever to be seated and ten another eon for wait staff to come to your table, they take your drink order and then vanish for at least 20 minutes--without even setting the party up with water glasses.  The atmosphere is dim and cozy--if only their menu and service were as well done.  Service here is by far the worst I have ever had. Slow is an understatement. It took 30 minutes for me (out of a table of four) to get a drink from a racist waitress (it was noted by everyone at the table, two of which were also African American), and another 15 after she finally had someone else bring it out because she screwed up an order for a Pepsi w/o ice. At the end of the meal our server had the audacity to blame her one other table because it was a large party--as if handling two tables was too much for her to handle.  The food is mediocre at best and definitely not worth the prices they charge. Quite honestly, I've had better pasta at Olive Garden and out of my own kitchen. Their steak dishes are decent but again overpriced. They give you enough food for a small army so beware if you're trying to monitor portions--you can always leave with a doggie bag...too bad the food is even worse reheated.  Their drinks are sub par, though I have friends who love their specialties. Personally, the strawberry daiquiris are FAR better at TGI Friday's.  Overall the only good thing about the place is Cheesecake. I say that only because I hate cheesecake but a couple of their many varieties actually appealed to me to try and I actually liked it. Not enough to become a lover of the desert, but they were good.

He also was very friendly and always had a smile on his face. However our food was a different story, my 2 younger children both ordered Mac and cheese. Both there orders we delivered with under cooked macaroni, I also received the wrong item. Nicholas was very apologetic about the mistake and the raw macaroni, he told me that he would have the manager come to talk to me. This however never happened, you would expect that the manager of such a nice restaurant would have come to apologize for the mistakes the kitchen has made. I have been to cheaper restaurants before and the manager would come rushing if something was wrong. I did not request any consolation for the mistakes with our order but I did expect at least the manager to show concern.

For parties looking for a vast array of entrees ranging from Cajun to Asian TCF will not disappoint. Granted all entrees here will have an ""americanized"" taste to it the taste factor has never disappointed. I will say upon my more recent visits the bread brought out as an appetizer has been hit or miss. Sometimes the breads will be warm and others well I've eaten bricks softer than them. The entree's are definitely on the pricier side of the wallet but it's not overtly pricey where I just feel terrible.

Heidi B.,"Orlando, FL",74,160,24,5.0,2/1/2012,"Alright so I have to preface this review by stating that I love The Cheesecake Factory as a chain, regardless of the location or size of the restaurant itself.  Having said that, I really do enjoy the Winter Park Village Cheesecake Factory. I first started frequenting this Cheesecake when I moved to Orlando to go to school at UCF, and even though it was a little bit of a trek to get there, I always had a fun time going whether it was for a birthday dinner, date, or girls' night out. The ambiance of this restaurant is great--dim lighting, high ceilings, with plenty of indoor seating, some outdoor seating, a full bar, and even a bakery area for those who just want to order cheesecake or other delectable desserts.  As far as the service goes, I have actually never experienced an issue at this particular Cheesecake Factory. I unfortunately can't say the same about my old hometown Cheesecake in Fort Lauderdale, but I have also come to realize that if you go to any restaurant often enough you're likely to encounter a problem at some point.  One thing I do love at Cheesecake Factory is the bread basket. Another is the strawberry lemonade--worth a try if you've never had it anymore and enjoy sweet beverages. I would also recommend any of their salads, keeping in mind that their salads are HUGE (the good thing is they do sell half-salad portions). And of course if you've never had it, you need to try a slice of cheesecake--even if you have to share it across the table!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=180

Ashley H.,"Orlando, FL",228,378,23,3.0,10/27/2013,"If you've ever been to The Cheesecake Factory, you pretty much know what you're getting into. Huge restaurant, even bigger menu, and usually (if you're like me) you don't have room for actual cheesecake.  My favorite dish is the Tuna Tataki Salad. Pricy, yes, but it's a large salad with seared ahi tuna slices, avocado, tomato, greens, and a delicious soy-based dressing to go with it. A really healthy and yummy option. I also love the chicken pot stickers, although they have definitely gone up in price in the last year! My fiance loves the chicken parmesan sandwich and orders it every time we go.  The reason I couldn't rate this higher is because of the service. I go here by myself a lot, and the service can be spotty. If I'm alone, a lot of people choose to ignore me and focus on other people. However, last time we were here, I had the worst possible service. We ordered everything right away, from drinks to appetizers.  It took about 15 minutes to get any kind of drink on the table. Closer to 25 for the appetizer. But the entree? We waited over an hour to receive our food. At first we were nice about it and asked our server a few times. She kept saying it was ""coming out in a few minutes"". At one point she finally admitted that she put the food in late. She told us the food would come ""in two minutes"". Two minutes became 20. We politely asked to speak with a manager. When no one came, my fiance had to actually get up from the table and find her himself. Our food came as the manager arrived, and we explained our situation. I was really polite about the whole thing and just explained why we weren't happy.  At first she tried to excuse the situation by saying that the server was ""pacing our food"". I wasn't buying that, because no one paces out food for this long of a meal. Other patrons had already come and gone by the time we received our food. She looked at me and said, ""What do you want me to do?"" Like I was a nuisance to her. I asked her what she would normally do in this situation, and she said, ""Well, do you want to eat it or not?"" She was so charming, let me tell you. She walked away to let us decide whether we wanted to eat our food or not. We did, and asked for the check. They took off our entrees, which I felt was appropriate but never would have asked for.  The manager's response was so awful that I honestly feel like I would drive to the Millennia location before I'd come back to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=180
Sarah P.,"Ormond Beach, FL",0,7,,2.0,2/22/2016,"Almost every single time I come here my order is wrong. (There's been only two that the order has been right). All I want is the ""Crispy Spicy Chicken Sandwich"" without the spicy sauce. It should NOT be that hard to ring in the sandwich with no sauce!  It has been wrong at LEAST 6 times I've been there. Usually the servers admit that they misunderstood which is fine, but tonight the server said she ""went ahead and got me the regular chicken sandwich"" which is a different cut of chicken, on a different type of bread, with a whole bunch of stuff on it and it was grilled instead of fried. She even asked when I ordered if I wanted chipotle or buffalo sauce when I ordered the spicy crispy chicken. There's no way she misunderstood me that much. You don't just change someone's orders. It's unacceptable. Cheesecake Factory, if you're going to have a huge menu, you need to spend way more time training your servers. And when they mess up, they need to go straight to the kitchen and call for the food, then immediately get a manger. Instead our server went to the computer to ring it in the second time. I don't think she got a manager since no one came to our table while I waited for the second (still wrong) sandwich.

andrea c.,"Manhattan, NY",2,35,4,1.0,2/28/2011,"Its way too overpriced for a cafeteria experience.  What a rip-off.  I used to love Cheesecake Factory, stopped going when I moved out of the area and have been back to this location twice in the last year. The first visit was for a day-time lunch and it was fine, nothing special, but its just a chain restaurant.  The last time I went on a Friday night.  The service was terrible from the get-go.  I'm not sure if we arrived at the time when lunch turned to dinner - but they wouldn't seat anybody for at least 20 minutes despite the fact that the dining room was practically empty.  Then, they seated us all at once.  We had told them we were a party of 3 and when the girl called us, she said party of 4.  I corrected her, to make sure we weren't taking somebody else's table and she got very upset and told us that we would have to be taken off the list and put back on at the end if we were going to change our minds.  Then another girl quickly came over and took care of the situation, but it was just the beginning of the bad service. When were finally seated, the seats and tables are so close together that without trying you're completely aware of the people next to you, what they're ordering, everything the server says to them, how there meal is.. its cramped quarters unless you get a booth - but they won't give booths to parties of less than 4 people.   I ordered the gluten-free beer that was on the menu - but when the server  came back, they were out and she didn't think they were re-stocking.  So beware, its on the menu and online, but they don't have it.  I ordered the only VEGAN item on the menu  - a salad and when I didn't want to add chicken or shrimp the girl rolled her eyes at me.  Its pretty typical to get bad service when you ask a lot of questions about the food.   When the salad came out it was missing 3-4 key ingredients.  I received a giant bowl of torn iceburg (not romaine people) iceburg with a chopped tomato and shredded carrots.  I had to ask her for the other ingredients that were listed in the menu (I'm forgetting the specifics now).  She said that nobody ordered this ""cheap salad"" so it wasn't their fault that they forgot.  By the time our 3 party was out of there the bill was almost $80.  Thank goodness one of us had a gift certificate.   Its way too overpriced for a cafeteria experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=240

At this location, however, on a recent visit, I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (one of my favorites). When it arrived at our table, the dish was 1/2 the size it normally is ($16.95) for this dish. I was with several clients, so I did not want to make a scene, but I was shocked to say the least. I thought maybe they had mistakenly given me a lunch size portion of this meal and would have charged me accordingly, but that was not the case. I was still charged the $16.95 price. Normally, I would eat 1/2 of this meal and take the other half home, acceptable solution for the high priced meal. Not on this occasion. I ate the entire 1/2 portion that was served to me. I left very disappointed. Not only was the portion 1/2 it's normal size, but the chicken in this dish was grizzly, someone forgot to trim the fat off the chicken!

For dessert I chose the Apple Caramel strudel Cheesecake, which was the topping to an amazing meal. The restaurant is very nice and clean. I wouldn't recommend this locale for an intimate or romantic dinner as the inside dining can get a bit loud. You could try the patio dining but it still may not be the best for that special date or anniversary if you're looking for something a bit more private. All in all I love this restaurant and would recommend it if your looking for a great meal and variety of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-winter-park?start=240
