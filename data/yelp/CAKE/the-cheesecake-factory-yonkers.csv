Shoshana R.,"Bronx, NY",30,96,311,4.0,12/24/2017,"I have visited this location multiple times (more then I care to admit) since it has opened. The mixed reviews are accurate, I have to admit there has been a noticeable decline in service and in some instances even food.  However, you have to give credit where credit is do. On this particular visit (12/22/17) my service was outstanding and that is due solely to BRANDON Q. This guy was on point. I usually come despite the service because it's close.  Customarily everyone here is blah blah and can careless about their jobs or more importantly the customers at times, but BRANDON was top notch and on point without being obnoxiously overbearing. To top it off it was during happy hour the weekend before Christmas when the volume of activity was noticeably increased quite a bit and he managed it all.  I was so impressed by the service Brandon Q. provided that I was moved to actually write a  review after all this time.  Full disclosure... this is not always the best location to visit. The time of day and week is a key factor in the type of service you may or may not receive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers
Patricia H.,"Hartsdale, NY",1,61,,2.0,1/10/2018,"This Cheesecake Factory is not the best.   Interestingly enough, I had the same waitress who messed up the same order about two weeks earlier.  I crossed my fingers that she wouldn't mess it up this time. Well, not all wishes come true.    She was also on ""lunch break"" when the mess up happened.  She later said she entered it oddly in the computer... for the second time.  One of the people (who was not our waitress) delivering the food to our table had an attitude when I told her my order wasn't right.  I subbed my pasta for fries because I can't eat pasta.  Her eyes were rolling and she said that the kitchen didn't make that dish like that.... I told her I go there often so I know for a fact they do... She said well they change it daily... I just stared at her after that.  Eventually, she took the cue and took my food back to the kitchen.  It took 20+ minutes.  My date ate without me because I didn't want his food to get cold.  They comped our appetizer only because I asked to speak to a manager.   Our waiter then came back from lunch break and asked if we wanted cheesecake that was complimentary. We said EH OK.  She said she'd bring us a menu. She never did. Turns out when she realized the manager comped our appetizer - she just decided not to bring us a dessert menu.  Instead without us even saying a word - she said (20 minutes later), ""By the way, I just got the sense you didn't want the dessert so I decided not to bring the menu."" Again. I stared blankly.   It was just not a memorable experience.  I would think twice before going to this particular location. 2 stars for the other waitress who helped out while our waitress was on a lunch break and the fact that parking is comped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers
TastyLadiesNY P.,"Bronx, NY",319,185,1477,4.0,12/2/2017,"After a day of Holiday shopping, a great dining spot at the Ridge Hill shopping center is The Cheesecake Factory (Yonkers, NY).  They have something for everyone!  All the food was great but the dish that stole our hearts and palates was the chicken Parmignia pizza!! The ""Crust"" was actually the chicken with a mound of spaghetti in the middle!  I know, it sounds odd, but it was delicious!!  Our other dishes of fried Mac and cheese, Mexican tortilla salad, spicy chipotle chicken sandwich and Parmesan garlic bread with marinara dipping sauce were all wonderful!!  The service was quick and professional even though it was crowded with seasonal shoppers!  Also with a whole dessert case to choose from, this dining experience was a gift of pleasures!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers

The staffs are nice to us even though you can see they are already tired maybe from a day long working here or from something else. I believe this branch is understaff... it really took awhile for our waitress to get back to us after getting our order. I noticed that she was going from one table to another and there were fewer than the usual number of staffs that night.

Rudy B.,"Thousand Island Park, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/11/2018,"Where do I start? I rarely ever write reviews unless I've had exceptionally great service or in this case exceptionally bad service/experience.  I won't take time to talk about or name my server because I'm a firm believer that your staff is only as good as the management. So let's talk about management. They suck and need to be refreshed on what it takes to run an effective and excellent shift. Let's start with basics; customer service, cleanliness, attention to detail, food safety and quality(temping), and properly training your FOH and BOH staff. These are the basic fundamentals to customer retention and satisfaction and the main ingredient in revenue growth! I work in upper management for QSR and let me tell you, what I experienced is so subpar and unacceptable. If I was given one month at this establishment I'd turn it around 360. Please do better because this is a bad representation of the Cheesecake Factory brand that I'm accustomed to. Thoroughly disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers

I ordered Ribeye  steak than that was good, my son had steak taco and it was so so, ( I can get better taco on the street of queens  around Jackson Heights) and my wife had veg pasta.

Quinton M.,"East Bronx, NY",50,56,34,3.0,5/31/2017,"This brand of restaurant is my wife's favorite so we decided to try this one in Ridge Hill mall. The service was good a tad improvement is needed. I forgot what my waiter name was he was very respectful and on point. The only thing I can say is don't assign a waiter if there break is coming up. The service was a sold 4 stars. The food is what makes it goes down. I ordered Southern fried catfish and it was ok. The fish itself was fried super hard it was burnt. The sides was mashed potatoes, green beans and sautéed spinach. The spinach had more flavor than the beans. The mashed potatoes had a whole freaking potato in it like it was so hard to push down on it. Why doesn't the hostess know if there are any deals? Why are there more than 5 hostess at the front just chatting?  I think I'll come back but just be mindful of the food and the price is ok for special occasions",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers

When I first came it wasn't as good as other locations I've been to but after a more recent visit I have to say they have stepped up there game to the Cheesecake Factory standard.

Jonathan N.,"New York, NY",64,65,337,2.0,3/21/2017,"Even by chain restaurant standards this place is a disaster. The often talked about wait times are almost unbearable on weekends, but you can't be mad at a restaurant for being popular. As annoying as the wait times are, that has no bearing on my rating. What really bothers me is the level of incompetence when they're NOT busy. Missing complimentary bread, dirty dishes and silverware, fruit flies, slow kitchen, and waitstaff that go missing for extended periods of time. I wish I could say they food is their saving grace, but as expansive as their menu is, almost everything I've tried is over salted, over cream-sauced, over cooked, and over portioned. Some dishes worth trying: Louisiana Chicken Pasta Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps Hibachi Steak Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Shrimp Scampi Some dishes to avoid: Carbonara Pasta Avocado Egg Rolls Steak Diane Chicken Madeira Chicken and Biscuits Southern Fried Catfish As you can see, I've eaten here more than I care to admit. It's almost like an abusive relationship, how I keep coming back and expecting them to change.

Sandra M.,"Pearl River, NY",78,38,84,2.0,4/17/2017,"I'm not one to give low ratings but this place really did it for me. We walked in at 5:30 on a Monday afternoon and see the restaurant not very full and yet we are asked to wait 20-25 minutes to get a table set up. The waiters got confused on who was serving us as we got approached by 2 people within 3 minutes to greet us.  We ordered a cocktail. We ordered some small plates and we got an item from the kids menu. We requested spaghetti and meatballs from the kids menu. We ended up with a kids mac n cheese after being told that they ran out of kid sized meatballs. ??? So why did the table over clearly had an adult entree of a spaghetti and meatballs? Why can't they give kids the adult sized meatballs? The bathroom was full of paper towels and toilet liners. There was no toilet paper in the restroom so I proceeded to the ladies at the front desk to ask them to help find someone who can help me out. She couldn't leave her post to get it for me but will do when her colleague returned. Guess what? She came back with her colleague and didn't get the toilet paper. I asked the other woman at the front desk and she said, oh you need toilet paper? I think my colleague went to get it. No she didn't. She was socializing with a male waiter! What? What?  Our server Mark was accommodating therefore the 2 stars.  Finally, we ordered Taylor tots that never came. They said it's because the order went to the wrong table. 20 min later it still hasn't arrived. We took it off the bill. No questions asked. I feel like the staff is ok with this kind of mess up and know how to take it off the bill for the customer.  Overall I think this Cheescake factory is understaffed and the management could delegate the staff to be more enthusiastic about working there. The people looked burned out and non-energized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers

Katie S.,"New York, NY",201,236,299,2.0,12/26/2016,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations, and this is one of the worst. When it is crowded, service is incredibly slow.  My party of four spent almost 2 hours there for lunch today, and no one apologized for or even acknowledged our 35 minute wait between clearing our appetizers and delivering our entrees.  This location also has cleanliness issues. I encountered a piece of chocolate cheesecake on the floor on my walk to the bathroom, and then the bathroom itself was dirty (and there was no soap in the soap dispenser) despite the fact that I passed a bathroom attendant on her way out as I was entering.  The food itself seems to be on par with other Cheesecake Factory locations. Cheesecake options abound! Finally, we've ordered dinner to go from here on many occasions, and the pick up process is very slow. Because there's no separate pick up like for to go orders, you have to wait behind people making their cheesecake selections, which can take a long time. Food is also sometimes not ready in the window they've told you over the phone, so then you're stuck waiting while your car is parked in the to go area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=20

Renee R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,69,94,1.0,7/5/2017,"Ok let's start off by saying this: my server was really nice and she was just simply overwhelmed with how busy the restaurant was. When I spoke to the Mgr he was a total moron who knew the place was bad with service and there was nothing he could do to manage it because he has no manager skills clearly. He didn't even give a crap when I told him your service in the kitchens are horrible. But let's begin. Went in with my friend and our 3 kids. Ordered kids meals an app plus our food. Kids meals were wrong they brung out only the protein that was ordered but everything else was wrong wrong and wrong. They get their food & it's loaded with pepper. Like rediculously spicy and peppery for 5 year olds (and my kid loves hot sauce) asked for ranch instead we get ketchup. His grilled chicken was pathetic it was like 4 bites of a chicken. By the time 2/3 kids were half way done the 3rd child meal comes along. Mind you weve been there 45m at this time My friend and I are waiting and waiting for our meals. After an hour we ate all our app and starting to really lose it. Hour 15 goes by kids are over the whole experience they're done eating and losing their patience. No crayons or anything to entertain while we painfully wait for our food. Hour and a half later we ask her wth where's the food?? She explains Someone took mine to the wrong table and had her salad sitting under a hot light for 30mins. Asked if we wanted to wait for them to remake mine obviously the answer was a hell no way!!! We pack my friends salad which was hot and sitting around for 30mins which I don't think she should have had to pay for. We paid for everything literally everything expect my meal since it never came. And that was that we waited 2 hour, we spent $75 on 3 kids meals which were garbage a wilted salad that sat waiting to be served for over 30mins and chips w/guac .  Thanks Cheesecake Factory that was the SHITTIEST EXPERIENCE EVERRRRRRRRR!!!! You really take the crown on that one. Next time we waste our drive from NYC to ridge hill we'll be sure to ignore your restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=20

Drinks- I had the carribean cooler and a Sangria, my friend Annette had the blueberry mojito, my friend Janine had the blood orange mojito. All the drinks were delicious and not too strong.  Dinner- I had the crispy shrimp sandwich (loved it and would def get it again), Annette had the chicken piccata, Janine had the grilled steak tacos.

However, we were wrong. We waited 40 minutes to be seated, only to be treated with horrible service. My pasta had a burned smell and taste to it. The manager (Will) was called over and he admitted to having a burned smell. He had us order another entree of their menu, and that too had a burned smell to it. He gave us a complimentary cheesecake, however I know that he could've done more for us.  Customer service and referrals go a long way. Specially in a table of 4. My girlfriend loved that spot.

This time was no different, we all had the same comment it felt like someone just opened a bottle of salt on top of all our meals, the lemonades were also super sweet, the portion sizes are always generous so we all took food to go, I'm not sure I'd go back to Cheesecake Factory, I can eat better and have better service in smaller locations",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=20

Dominek T.,"New York, NY",456,303,408,3.0,6/13/2016,"Never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory and the food never wow'd me.  How can a restaurant have over 50 entrees available and be able to perfect them all?  That still boggles my mind.  The establishment itself is beautiful and the staff was kind and on top of their serving game. I had the gumbo but it was super salty and what it is interesting is they don't de-vein their shrimp. As much as they charge that should of been a given. Never the less I would come back if someone asked me to join them, but I rather spend my money on locally owned restaurant than large corporate chains.   I recommend make a reservation if you plan to come with large groups and if it is only two of you then just plant yourself at the bar for faster service.   Also,  Cheesecake Factory validates your parking for the first two hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=20

Yes, anyone that's eaten at any other Cheesecake Factory knows that the wait time is long. It isn't exclusive to this location and its not the fault of the staff/owners that the restaurant is popular, especially on the weekends. In terms of food, everything is mostly good. My guilty-pleasure food is the mac&cheese burger, although I try not to have it too often, for obvious, artery-clogging reasons. Ive never personally had an issue with the service at this location. Everyone has been mostly pleasant.

We made sure to come a little past noon as this location has the tendency to get very crowded during a weekend afternoon. Our waitress was both courteous and helpful as she gave us plenty of ample time to decide our orders. The Cheesecake Factory is one of my absolute favorite restaurants as the menu options are many and the food (at least the entrees I've ordered) are always delicioso!  This time around, I ordered the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage Lunch Special and my mom ordered the Meatloaf Lunch Special. The portion that I received versus my mom's plate was dispproprotionate! My portion truly looked like the lunch special while my mom's looked like the full on dinner entree! My meal was delicious but I didn't get to take any of it home like my mom did because it was significantly smaller! That would be my only complaint!

We had a table of 8, our server forgot to bring my meal out. If she checked in with the table she would have realized but we had to stop another waiter to figure it out. My meal came out but only half of it. Mind you, I ordered shrimp and rice the easiest meal at the table. One of my friends ordered steak. My shrimp came out and then the waiter told me 30 secs for the rice, which was more like 8 mins. I was basically finished before my rice came out. She took over average lengths of time to come back to tend to the table. We even felt we were waiting too long to pay for our bill.

Also, the shrimp scampi dish is amazing. The shrimp is top quality and the sauce is delicious. It comes with angel hair pasta, which is also great! Overall, definitely one of their top entrees. Everyone also enjoys their burgers because they have a great variety. However, if you love seafood and pasta - their shrimp scampi dish is excellent. Of course, the cheesecake is the best too. The banana creme one is my personal favorite.  The decor is very romantic and beautifully arranged. There is usually a wait to be seated at the Cheesecake factory. Especially after 7pm. However, it is definitely worth trying. They serve you bread with your dinner and offer great drinks to choose from. There is a bar area for those looking to come for drinks and a quick bite. They also offer a ""skinnylicious""menu for people that are on a diet.  It is a very broad menu. Some dishes are better than others. If you try what I suggested, I am sure you will be happy because it was very good. Stay away from the spinach and artichoke dip and the pot stickers.

But I can't in good conscience give a bad experience a pass. My wife and I were celebrating our 14th wedding anniversary. This is the fourth or fifth Cheesecake factory I have been to, I figured you can't go wrong. Boy was I wrong. To start with, my Bluemoon draft beer was ""flat"". Either it was poured wrong or the tap/line was dirty. The service was decent, but the main dishes were pretty bad. My wife always orders the same dish- the chicken farfalle with roasted garlic. This time the panchetta was burned black and made the entire dish  taste like a charcoal bricket. The cream sauce was very watery and had not been reduced properly and the dish was quite salty. My dish was pretty good. I ordered the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi. The mashed potatoes were salty and cold and it came with three large shrimp and three medallions of steak which was cooked exactly as requested (the meat was lacking salt). The cheesecake was great, especially their new salted caramel. On our way out my wife and I used the rest rooms. Both were out of toilet paper, filthy and the mens room had a special surprise. Either someone had an accident or they used the bathroom and realized there was no toilet paper and left a pair of dirty underwear in the stall to accompany the pissed on toilet seat and soggy floor. Overall the ambience of the restaurant is nice and the area where it is located is incredibly nice. But they need to get their act together and the cooks have to maintain high quality standards and management needs to ensure that the bathrooms are checked on regularly because it is such a busy restaurant.

A gust of wind unlodged the umbrella from the pole and flew nearly knocking all of our heads off with the wooden pole. The umbrella hit a person in the face and ended up in the middle of our table. We were so shaken up by the experience that we were unable to complete our meals. Someone came out to apologize and give us free desserts. Later we found out she was the manager. She said she would give us free cheesecake. At this point we were ready to go. We ask to speak to a manager and it took 25 minutes. I never knew Cheesecake Factory to be so unprofessional I am really unhappy. BOTH MANAGERS. Were very dismissive when they came over to speak to us. We were explaining that we did not eat ANY.

That was a problem, but suddenly some dude just asked if I needed a table. ""Yeah..."" 2 minutes later I was sitting down checking out the drink menu. That guy wasn't the server but I still ended up tipping him. CF has a bunch of specialty drinks to satisfy any alchie, and I noticed that they have some special low calorie menu, which I quickly dismissed.  The server was very much on point and she suggested some really good avocado egg rolls. Somehow as soon as the appetizers were finished the entrees came out--very memorable service. The Cajun jambalaya was...well, I'd like to have some right now, and the steak Diane with chicken Madeira(?) was absolutely drool worthy. Yeah, that was really good. The server I had was very important though, because she had to leave towards the end and the person who replaced her wasn't the same.

June G.,"Manhattan, NY",36,36,10,2.0,9/12/2015,"While I absolutely LOVE the Cheesecake Factory brand, including Grand Lux Cafe, the location at Ridge Hill is abysmal. Initially, I thought their issues could be worked out over time, because every new establishment has to work out its kinks, but this location has now been operational for years. The Good - (1) the Ridge Hill location is super convenient and Cheesecake Factory is one of two businesses in the plaza that validate parking. (2) when the kitchen is on, they serve the usual Cheesecake Factory food well. (3) the bar seating is first come, first serve so often you can avoid the wait The Bad - (1) the kitchen is terribly inconsistent. Cheesecake Factory rests its entire reputation on its machine-like functionality and consistent quality across various locations. THIS location, however, is the only one that I've visited (of many nationwide) in which I never know what I'm going to get on my plate. They've messed up everything from basic Steamed Edamame to signature dishes like Chicken Madeira. (2) Management is constantly turning over so whenever I've had issues, the excuse is ""we have a new [insert restaurant unit] manager"" (3) they seem to be understaffed or don't manage the staffing schedule well - everything is a wait, even when they open.  Ultimately, this place will do business because of The Cheesecake Factory reputation BUT do not go expecting the typical CF experience or you'll be sorely disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=100

No problem, we get a chance to do some more shopping while we wait.  We're greeted by our server who is very pleasant and brought us our appetizers in a flash. I'm eating my Crispy Cuban Rolls. They're quite flakey but at the same time very greasy.  They're not greasy enough for me not to dig in! As I take a bite into the third roll, I hurt my tooth. There is something unidentifiable in the roll. It appeared to be edible but not as hard as it was. I pointed it out to the server who brought a manager immediately. Apparently it was a piece of the pork's cartilage that the manager ""Mike"" explained should have never been there and agreed he too would be grossed out if it happened to him.

Came out piping hot and deliciously flavorful. We were nearly full from eating that dish alone. Hubby ordered California Avocado salad, which was a fair large size for the dish. For dinner, he ordered the California Cheesesteak, OMG! Sooo good- thinly sliced steak with sautéed mushrooms, onions, peppers and cheese on a soft toasted sourdough loaf. Of course, with a side of fries.  Avocado Eggrolls (appetizer) - They were crisp wrapper filled eggrolls with fried avocado (was so savory) with tomato, red onion and cilantro. I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp.  OMGGG! I was slightly overwhelmed with the generous amount of sautéed spicy shrimp on my plate, marinated with the mouth watering Jamaican spicy sauce. Other side dishes it was served were brown rice (my preference, but white was avail), black beans, and sweet plantains and cool mango salsa. I couldn't finish my plate, but ate it the next day and I swear it tasted even better.  We ended up taking ALL the food home actually, but couldn't leave without ordering dessert! We ordered the Carrot Cake Cheesecake - carrot cake and cheesecake together, with cream cheese icing and almonds and a Carrot Cake -layers carrot cake and cream cheese icing with shreds of carrots, spices, and faint minuscule-like pieces of pineapple. Served with an unselfish heap of whipped cream. Definitely money well-spent. A great experience for a foodie like me",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=100

It was delicious however I noticed they are serving less than before. Also I noticed they were scarce on the bread. Drink: passion fruit margarita. It was strong but once it iced out it was very refreshing and satisfying.  All for drinks were well served except for the ultimate margarita... So much ice.

Candace G.,"New Rochelle, NY",42,38,,2.0,5/8/2016,"We were a party of 6 on a Saturday night, so we expected a wait. We were told 1 hour 20 minutes, but waited closer to two hours. While we waited, we were lucky to get two seats at the bar. Only to sit next to several angry customers who were eating at the bar because their waits had been so long. The bar staff was lackluster and more interested in talking to each other than helping customers. Then the real disaster started when we were seated. It took way too long to get anyone to stop at our table for water or to take a drink order. Once we finally ordered, the appetizers came and were just OK. Our entrees came, and the hamburger ordered medium came out looking like beyond well done. That took a long time to find our new server (they changed servers for some reason) she took it back and said they would make a new one. By the time the new one came, everyone had finished their dinners. It was also improperly cooked - rare on the inside and burned on the outside. I wasted 3 1/2 hours of my life in here, and can't believe how crowded it is. Why do people go here when there are so many other places in the same shopping center??

I came here on monday at like 2pm it wasn't busy but somehow our waitress was inattentive to our needs. We were there for nearly an hour before she took our Order for food. While waiting for the food she brought out my beverage of a raspberry lemonade which tasted like 99% sugar and 1% juice. I asked for a soda instead and she left the lemonade on the table and didn't pick it up until after we paid for the check. My friend ordered tea and she left the box of the tea selection there the whole time. As well as the fact that our food came out Cold and she forgot to put another guest of our parties order. She then insisted that she could validate our parking ticket for the three of us and it turned out she didn't even do that correctly. The only good thing about this place is the food and the decor.

Princess R.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,2,,1.0,7/13/2017,"My experience at this location yesterday wasn't very pleasant. I sat at a table with my family for at least 15mins before a server came and greeted us. When the server (Kiy) did greet us he introduced himself and said "" I guess I'm going to take this table because no one else is"". We then ordered three waters one with lemon and a Dr Pepper. Another 15mins went by and still no beverages. He approached the table and we jokingly said did you forget about us? He responses in telling us that they were no cups in the restaurant and that they were short a dishwasher. We told him it was okay to just give us the drinks in to go cups and ordered a pina colada, some apps and our food. 10mins after that he brings our drinks not including the pina colada (which I figured he was going to the bar to get so I didn't bring it up at that moment) or lemon for one of the waters. At this point we were annoyed and didn't want to ask our server for nothing more because it seemed like a bother to him as he continued to past our table and pay us no mind. The appetizers came out and were delicious but once our entrees came everything started going downhill again. Our food did not come out all together. When the last person got her food half of what she ordered wasn't there. We were told that it would be up in a second. 3 out of 4 of us had pasta so we asked for cheese and did not receive it neither. Then finally a manager walks by I'm guessing to touch base and explain to us why the pot stickers we ordered were still not there. He explained that the kitchen was short staff and they had to make the pot stickers from scratch which honestly should have been explained to us rather than having us thinking everything was under control. I'm beyond frustrated at this point and tell them to cancel that order of pot stickers. I then continue to explain to the manager (warren) that we weren't getting anything we ask for this whole night. No pina colada, no lemon, no cheese, no pot stickers and on top of all that horrible service. Little things could have made up for this bad experience but not one time did Kiy try to turn our experience around. When it was time for the bill the manager had to take off the pina colada that we never received and the pot stickers he also discounted a lot off our bill which we very much appreciated but the managers should not be held accountable every time a server can't seem to get it together. If he was communicating with us I'm pretty sure we would of understood a little more. After speaking to the manager for a while he learned it was my older cousins birthday and got her a cheese cake on the house which put a smile on her face. I end in saying every job is not for everyone and you can't make someone happy if you're not happy with what you're doing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=120

Kathy L.,"Bronxville, NY",0,9,,4.0,7/10/2016,"We have been to this location a few times. It is kid-friendly and there's a big variety food although the menu can be overwhelming. Overall, it is a good experience if you get there early before it starts to get crowded. My biggest complaint is the take-out counter which has compelled me to write a review.  Here is my breakdown.  Service - We have never had any issues with the wait staff. They are always pleasant and extremely attentive. Our waiter yesterday knew we liked the bread and made sure we had plenty. He came back at the right times after our appetizers, entrees and desserts came to see how we were doing. One complaint about the service is that my child's entrée came before the beverage came.  Food - Food is a hit or miss. There are plenty of eye-catching items on the menu but to read the whole menu takes awhile. I've had the burger before and those are always a hit. I had the fish taco last time and the tacos itself was good but the rice was bland and the beans had a taste to it as if it was many days old.  Dessert - No complaints but should always ask if one wants whipped cream or not. I am not a fan of whipped cream but my child is.  Take-out counter - We didn't want to carry the cheesecake around while we shopped so we came back later on. Not sure where the lack of communication is but there are two people behind the counters and waiters waiting for their dessert and coffee to bring to diners. I don't know why it took over 10 mins for two lattes and two pieces of cheesecake to go. One of them disappeared to get a jar of dressing that was clearly at the counter and the other was pre-occupied. There really isn't a reason to have people wait long enough that one of the maitre'd had to make our lattes herself.  Overall - I will come here again because of my love for cheesecake and the friendly wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=120

Elsa L.,"Yonkers, NY",135,28,24,4.0,5/1/2015,"I have come to this particular cheesecake factory only about 3 or 4 times. I haven't had to particularly wait too long but maybe its because i always go during the week. Only once did i need to wait about 30 minutes or so but we went to Sephora across the street and time went by fast.  The staff have always been friendly and attentive. I haven't had to constantly look for my server because they always come to check up on us.  I love love LOVE the Piña Colada from here. Don't like Piña coladas with alcohol so i always order the Virgin Piña coladas and they're amazing. Recommend to everyone! The food is also good but i wouldn't say its amazing. I'd Recommend the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and also the Pasta Da Vinci. Sometimes i find the food too greasy and then i look at the calories of each plate and see why its so high. I just wish it was a bit less greasy. I like how they give free refills with the soda though.  The place is really nice, dim and have outdoor seating good for the warm days ahead.  Lets not forget the reason why they're very famous....the CHEESECAKE. Love the cheesecake. Red Velvet Cheesecake is delicious but my favorite is the classic cheesecake.

The Cheesecake Factory itself is magnificent , very late very classy and it even has a full bar. It provides a certain atmosphere of peace and tranquility that makes U feel relaxed and welcome.  I didn't get to dive into the food a lot in terms of options but what I did have was incredible . Coming here hungry but wasn't crazing a meal I stuck to appetizers. I ordered buffalo wings and chicken sliders with fries . Simple, not too much and thinking I wasn't gonna be as full so I can have a cheesecake... Boy I was wrong . I had six pieces of wings and 1 small chicken slider, and I was beyond full . It was flavorful and the buffalo wings were tasty and spicy . For a place that specializes in cheesecake their wings are to die for . I did order a cheesecake and it was the dulce de leche with caramel cheesecake and it was an amazing choice. Really sweet and you can taste all the sweets given in. Overall the environment, location , taste and portions will leave you coming for more . The price overall was a bit high considering the little I ordered ( just over 60 for the apps and cheesecake, plus a drink) but it was definitely worth it because I was nothing short of satisfied .

I asked the waiter is this chicken she said yea but I still wasn't buying it. So I told her call me the manager he came and I showed him the pink peices and he said I'll have to ask my kitchen manager. He finally comes back and states that they accidentally switched the order. Mind you we don't eat pork!!! And he claimed that they will make the right one now I said no thank you. Instead of having dessert on the house they made us pay for it after saying they will take care of us. The only thing they took off was the app that they got wrong. Cheesecake was served to us still frozen. Literally this is the worst place ever. They tell you 30 mins to wait it's way longer of a wait then that.

cedes w.,"JAMAICA, NY",2,66,3,1.0,6/12/2016,"My husband, mother, children and I visited the cheesecake factory at Ridgehill this past week. We visited due to my husband's birthday and my daughter's graduation (This was my husband's first time at any cheesecake factory). From the beginning, I was disappointed with the service and quality of the food. As it being a weekday (Tuesday), it wasn't very busy and we were seated almost immediately outside (upon our request). EVERY SINGLE THING we wanted, I had to call the waiter over to get. I had to find him to get our appetizers in, call him over to get our drinks ordered, request water, ask for him to come so we could get our entree order in. He simply neglected our table. When it got a little chilly, we asked for the heater to be turned on. When the heater turned off, we asked the waiter to turn it back on. He said okay but walked back inside. We had to request the manager when he walked by to help us and turn it on. To add insult to injury half of the time, the waiter was just standing around at the other end of the patio. One other thing that bothered me was that I asked for a glass of water and I told him it was my husband's birthday and I would like for him to get sung happy birthday at the table. He said okay. The food came (much smaller portions than the Nyack and White Plains location) and we finished. He came and just gave us the bill. There was no asking of if we wanted dessert, no asking if we wanted anything else and certainly no happy birthday for my husband. I became infuriated because once I gave him my card he literally stood next to our table eyeing the tip. So lets recap, I had to ask for everything for our meal, you never returned regarding our heater, and didn't sing happy birthday as I requested. We will never be returning to the cheesecake factory at this location ever again. People come to the cheesecake factory for a delicious special meal to share with friends and family.

She never offered me water or any kind of service or small talk. I so badly wanted to tell her if she was as miserable as she seems, she should find a new job. It took Godly strength to leave her the 10% tip I did leave. I think this bar would benefit from a friendly bartender.

Mirtha M.,"Bronx, NY",2,8,3,2.0,9/16/2014,"What a disappointment, I have been to this Cheesecake Factory before and the wait has been ""long"", but nothing compared to this past Sundays visit. My review will be solely based on the recent visit this past Sunday.  After leaving the apple store (right across from CCF) we went into the cheese cake factory and we were told the wait was 40-45 mins. Idk what 5 minutes difference would have done but my family (party of 6) and I agreed. It was 5:30pm.. We were given a little alarm lighting device that will tell you when your table is ready; we got distracted with other people and the children in our party that we failed notice that the time was 6:56. Hmm ok, we ask how much longer and they tell us that there's one party in front of us. Ok.  Finally the darn thing rings at 7:02. We are shown our seats and about 5 minutes later our server approaches us.. And asks what we would like to drink, party of 6 says what they are drinking and he's not taking notes. We get distracted again and notice we haven't received water or their delicious bread.. The server comes back and I shout, we are ready to order appetizers, now he takes the note pad and writes down the appetizers and asks us to tell him our drinks again.  appetizers, arrive 30 mins later and still no bread or water. By this point I'm upset, I hate waiting so long after being seated. I stop one of the girls in the black uniform and tell her I want to speak to the manager. The manager arrives fairly quickly and everyone in the table looks at me to spill my feelings of angry, Spanish, hungry woman! And I do that.  I begin stating that the wait to be seated was long, the wait for the bread was long, we haven't received water and the time is now 7:45. He was very nice, that one star is for him. Lol he told us that is not the servers fault, they were out of bread and they were out of glasses for drinks, that he had to make the drinks himself. -_- my drink, passion fruit mojito... Watered down, but I was more interested in the food. The manager tells us that he will make sure everything is smooth from here on out. Ok.  Our food arrived 8 something, food was ok, but I couldn't enjoy because I was upset lol i finished my plate steak Diane & mash and told the waiter that I was ready for dessert, I order my cheese cake & tell him we are ready for the bill. The bill arrives and I couldn't take it anymore, I got up and paid at the front little desk and waited and took my cheesecake to go. Smh!  If I go back it will be after having a full meal, because I will be hungry when I finish digesting what I had previously had eaten... And ready to eat again!

Sarah H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/28/2015,"I have been a regular at this Cheesecake Factory for the past three years. I have had all of my birthday dinners there. I don't really mind the mediocre service or wait times because I love the food there and, at this point, it's a tradition. I went there on Sunday for my 22nd birthday party. We were seated outside and it was very cold, I ended on wrapping myself up in a hammock to stay warm, but I didn't mind... that's how much I love the Cheesecake factory. My actual birthday, the next day, Monday, a series of terrible things happened making this one of the worst birthdays I've had. My girlfriend's computer crashed (we are seniors at Sarah Lawrence College during our finals week) and I ended up spending a lot of the day with her at the apple store trying to find a solution. To cheer up, before we went home, she suggested a cocktail at the Cheesecake factory. We went to the bar and my waiter from the night before recognized me. ""Hey birthday girl!"" he said, before leaving the bar. I explained that today was my actual birthday so I was just coming in for a drink. The bartender took mine and my girlfriend's IDs, after looking at them for approximately 3 seconds, decided ""neither of these are real,"" throwing them down on the counter and walked away. I called him back over and asked him to scan it or enter it in the computer because it was, in fact, my actual license. He pulled out an ID guide book and told me that my ID should be horizontal if I was 21 (it's a South Carolina ID because I'm a student at Sarah Lawrence, from South Carolina originally). I explained that I had gotten it shortly before I turned 21 since I had lost my old one and needed it replaced. It's vertical, but clearly says ""UNDER 21 UNTIL"" my birthday last year. He asked if I had any other forms of identification that matched this name and I pulled out both of my debit cards and student ID, all clearly stating my name and the ID also had my photo and year at school. He walked away, and for a second I thought he was going to serve us, but it turns out he was just ignoring us and talking to one of the waiters.  At this point, I started to cry. It had already been a horrible birthday, now I couldn't even get a drink at my favorite restaurant. Not only was I not being served, the bartender was rude and condescending. Two men were also behind the bar and we asked if one of them was the manager. The manager came over, looked at our IDs, and still didn't believe mine was real. Let me just say, at this point, that I have never had any issue with this ID. It is my real South Carolina ID that clearly stated it was my 22nd birthday. The manager questioned that as well, holding back a laugh as he said he just ""wasn't so sure about this one."" I asked him to scan it. He didn't. The bartender then comes over, and says ""So you're from South Carolina, and you know Eli?"" I didn't know who Eli was, but he kept nodding to the back of the restaurant so I guess he was referring to the waiter who had recognized me when I walked in. My girlfriend tried to explain that I was here last night for my 22nd birthday, but at this point the bartender wasn't listening and was talking over us. We left, because at that point I was openly crying and didn't want to sit at a bar with these two jerks.  Maybe they didn't have a scanner. That's unfortunate. I just don't understand why they would think I would go to all of that effort if my ID was fake. Thank you for ruining my 22nd birthday, Cheesecake Factory. I have returned here even after shoddy service and many mistakes because I work in the service industry and know that a lot can go wrong in a restaurant. But both of these men were extremely rude and condescending to me just because I look young, refusing to serve me when I was using my valid license.

I walked in and was greeted , and when asked to be seated outside they tried seating me in the sun. I saw a table in the shade that needed to be cleaned to able to seat so i asked if i could sit there. I waited another 10 minutes and when walking towards the table i had to wait another 5 minutes because someone forgot all their trays. When they came to get the tray they dropped water all over the seat, so another 10 minutes was placed waiting for someone to come dry it. When seated our waiter was so dull, she didnt seam to care and when asked about the bread she seemed irritated about the question. We asked for a towel because the table was still wet and she came over dropped it and left. We got our things and left ! I never felt that kind of negativity before.

Jerry M.,"New York, NY",17,157,25,3.0,11/5/2013,"Yes, The Cheesecake Factory is tacky. Yes, the dishes can be repulsive, the menu is overwhelming, service is mediocre, and portion sizes are disturbingly large. It's a chain restaurant that represents much of what is wrong with this country - obese individuals perusing the menu with the 2000+ calorie salads and not batting an eye, then, they bring it home to enjoy as a late night snack. Now that I've said that, I also must say - I love it here. I hate myself for eating here, I really do, but if someone suggests it, I'm game. The buffalo blasters are the most gluttonous, mouth-watering, artery clogging appetizer I have ever enjoyed. In my perfect world, we could all eat buffalo blasters for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without ever having to worry about our skyrocketing cholesterol levels and collapsing life expectancy. Yes, they are that good - the pinnacle of appetizers. I've tried a number of entrees here, they all have the same theme - am I supposed to eat this by myself? Yes, you are. Buckle up and enjoy the ride. Each dish feels as if it was created for everyone to enjoy regardless of your particular taste nuances - from newborn baby to Michelin 3 Star Chef. The Cheesecake Factory isn't for everyone, but I can guarantee that anyone will be able to find something on the menu and enjoy - how can I hate on that?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=180

When I heard this, I asked if I could call ahead, they let us know how long the wait is and we'd plan accordingly. The manager refused and said since we were a large party we'd have to just show up. Well we get there and are told it's a 90 minute wait. It's Sunday night, we've been out all day and we're starving. So we wait. Luckily, it was 'only' 75 minutes but DD is done. He's uncomfortable and this wait hasn't helped.  The waitstaff was great in getting DD's food going first but he's ready to go home. He eats and my sister in law has take him to the van while we finish our dinner. $300 and she can't even enjoy the meal.  To be clear, we respected the no reservation policy. But I feel the workaround was more than fair. If we had known it was a 90 minute wait before we got there, my nephew could've come later and not have spent so much time in the wheelchair. There also would not have been the tension in our party and my sister in law would've been able to enjoy her meal.

Third time we called our order in 20 minutes ahead of time and when my girlfriend went in to pick it up. It wasn't ready. In fact, there was a lady ahead of her waiting to just pick up her order that was on the counter. They both waited 10 minutes before someone helped them. Apparently there were 3 people working and two were just sitting there chatting while one was actually busting her butt working. When we get home my ahi tuna salad with avocado has no avocado and has about 4 pieces of lettuce. I thought this was suppose to be a salad not garnish.

When my fried Macaroni cheese balls shows up another half hr later the inside was completely frozen. Strike 1.  2nd try I got a waiter after about 10minutes ok. The ordered Macaroni Cheese Balls again this time they were definitely old. Cheese tasted old. Sauce was hard. Just plain horrible. And of course the Waiter was no where to be found when u need him.  Last night same as usual. On a Wednesday night with maybe 5 couples in the restaurant. Still No service. Drinks took 20 minutes. Appetizers 30. The medium steak was completely burnt.

Food is similar to all the rest of cheesecake but everything has to do with the service since everything is streamlined and if the waiter/tress messes up than you are DONE! It starts with first impression: seating and getting the drink order--hostesses are always loaded with attitude and they just seem to hate you when they see you instead of welcoming you.  Then comes the bread and drink order THEY ARE ALWAYS LATE and these two never come in time. Also i realized that the bus person never ever cleans the table good just wipes it and sets it up.  One star because the food is like everywhere else and everything thats going on at this location has to do with the service not with the food.

The server (Kai M.), although he tried to be nice, was AWFUL.  We had to ask for our beverages 3 times.  Only one of our two apps came out (the sweet potato fries, which were the best things we tried that night).  Twenty minutes later, our main meal came out - still no second app (the shrimp spring rolls).  The steak Diane was ordered medium rare and came out well done.  The mashed potatoes were like a mountain of cold paste.  The mahi mahi was horribly overcooked - we were so frustrated, we sent that back and decided to just wait for the spring rolls as a main dish.  Once the server realized how frustrated we were, he avoided us like the plague.  The spring rolls finally arrived (still waiting for our beverages) and were actually pretty good.   To get the check, we actually had to stand up and put our coats on and just stand there, hoping the server would walk by.  Upon receiving the bill, the mahi (which we did not eat) was still on the bill, so we had to wait for it to be removed.   Awful awful experience here which was very disappointing, as we rarely get a family night out like that.  As a former server myself (having done it for ten years when I was younger), I can say that this is clearly a terribly managed restaurant in need of radical change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=200

We were a party of 6, with a 6 month old baby.  They waitstaff requested for us not to keep the stroller in the aisle - understandable.  However, they did not have a high chair that could accommodate a car seat, nor a chair that was safe for a child of that size.  We can't be the only people who have ever brought a child that small! For the 6 of us to have 2 rounds of drinks, 3 appetizers, and a bunch of burgers, it took over 2 hours from start to finish.  Mind you, this was at 7:30 on a Monday night - not exactly prime time dining. We were hoping to get in and out quickly to get the baby to bed, but so much for that. In regards to the service, very much like the others who have written about this location, the service was very slow.  Took at least 25 minutes to get our drinks after ordering, and 30 minutes after arrival to even put in our orders.  We had originally ordered 4 appetizers for table, and when only 3 showed up, we asked the waitress and she said ""oh, we didn't have any.  Don't worry, I took them off the bill"".  Really? We would have LOVED to have ordered another app to replace our original order, but by the time she asked we were already halfway through our appetizers and didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for one last dish.   For our meals, they brought out 5 out of 6.. the last, which was just some sort of chicken fingers, didn't come for 15 minutes.  The MOD was kind enough to take it off of our bill, but still.  We were all so annoyed by the time we finished our meals, we didn't even stay around for the birthday cheesecake we had originally come for.   Will NOT come back.

Kaylan N.,"Cortlandt, NY",0,5,,1.0,2/23/2013,"Tonight was by far the most horrible experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I've had bad experiences at this particular Cheesecake Factory before, but I keep on giving it a chance because I enjoy the food and the close proximity to my house.  Last time I went to the Yonkers Ridge Hill location, I ordered the chicken parm sandwich and they forgot to take out the layers of parchment paper before serving me the sandwich. I took a bite of my sandwich to find myself taking a bite of wax paper. The manager was very sorry and refired my order.  By the time I got a new sandwich, my whole table was done eating their meal. However, he did take the sandwich off the bill. Needless to say after twenty minutes of waiting, I asked for a box to take my food to go.  Tonight, we went to at 7:30. We walked up to the hostess and she said the wait would be 30-40 minutes. On a Saturday night at that time, we expected to wait for a little while. We waited for 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 1 hour and finally an hour and twenty minutes went by. I finally went up to check with the hostess after I saw several people that arrived after us be seated. The hostess looked in the computer and couldn't find our reservation at all. She said there was no record of our name or timer number. AFTER 1 hour and 20 minutes of waiting we weren't on the list! She quickly apologized and said we would be the next table seated. Then she proceeded to seat another table of two. As soon as we noticed this we brought it to her attention, she apologized again, and finally after 1 hour and 30 minutes, we were seated. We waited three times the promised wait time.  We get to our table and wait 5,10, 15 minutes. No one comes to greet us, take our drink order, nothing. I went up to the hostess station and brought this to her attention. I walked back to our table and someone came to the table to take our drink order, we said we were ready to place our whole order because we waited so long and were beyond starving, but we were quickly told ""I'm not your waiter, but I'll take your drink order.""  Finally, after almost 20 minutes of sitting at a table, the saving grace of our meal, Allan R. took our drink order. He was extremely apologetic and accommodating. Allan quickly took our order and got us our meal. Our food was very good. The manager took the appetizer off of our bill for our troubles. However, the fact that we had to wait 2 hours for a meal was completely unacceptable. The manager knew that they messed up with our reservation and said nothing. The manager knew that no one showed up at our table to take our order and only after the two hours of waiting did he approach us. He was very kind once he approached us and apologetic, but at that point, it was too late.  My fiancee and I frequent the Cheesecake Factory because of it's expansive menu and good food. However, these huge mistakes in customer service are far to frequent for my liking. We will not be returning to the Cheesecake Factory in Ridge Hill. By looking at the reviews on Yelp, it seems that this is a reoccurring problem. Perhaps corporate needs to take a closer look the customer service in the Yonkers Ridge Hill Cheesecake Factory because there are a lot of unacceptable issues. They got 1 star because Yelp doesn't allow you to give 0 stars. Save your cash and go to The Yard House.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=220
Teresa B.,"Pasadena, CA",440,304,466,3.0,12/16/2012,"Oh how I wanted to love my east coast experience of ""The Cheesecake Factory"" because of the west coast tastes that I used to have. I admit that, in Los Angeles, I used to have an affinity for the convenience of chain restaurants like Chili's, Moose McGillycuddy's, or  ::gasp:: TGI Fridays. In fact, my boo's daughter chose to have her graduation party at a ""Cheesecake Factory"" in San Diego. Located in the wonderful, new Ridgfield open-air mall, near the iconic Stew Leonards: I picked this restaurant as a starting point of my weekend get-away from the energy of NYC. Sadly, I was not impressed . Twice, for brunch, the concept of a over-medium egg wasn't  accomplished. The second time embarrassingly so. My food got cold waiting. Another server tried to appease me. The manager came over. Our server avoided eye contact. I'll exaggerate and say that it took an half hour for my eggs, But close enough!

Tonight that wasn't the case, thanks to the poor service from our waiter. The bar was set low on how he communicated , upon the initial sit down greeting. Upon taking the order , he was less than enthused to make the modifications we asked for . My daughter wanted pizza, and guess what the place was out of pizza. I'm sure he knew this ahead of time, but giggling with his fellow colleagues was more interesting . Our food arrives, and the burger has the wrong cheese, medium well apparently , means rare! We bring this to his attention , and he saids well this the cheese it comes with? And it's a dollar extra so you know! Great customer service , I think not!! Never follows up with our table to ensure everything else is okay! Total highlight of the night , brings us the check, and continues to socialize with his colleagues .

The first few times I went, I didn't particularly mind the slow service, but the last few times I've gone were the final straw! I do not plan to ever go back. Here was my last experience: First I waited 2+ hours for a table when it was near closing time. Literally the entire restaurant was empty save for two people sitting in one section and one large party sitting in another section. Instead of just combining tables to get us seated quicker, they made us wait over 2 hours for the one large party to finish. At first I thought it was the group that was slow, but once we were seated I realized that it was clearly the incompetent wait staff.  They took so long to take our order, then when we finished, took even longer to bring the check after we had asked for it. At this point we were literally the ONLY people in the entire restaurant. They even turned on the lights and started cleaning up around us, and still would not bring out the check. They should have been eager to have us pay and leave.  When we finally did get the check our waiter somehow had trouble understanding that the credit cards were to cover the bill and the cash left over was the tip (and despite the terrible experience we were still generous and tipped 20%). He literally tried to stop us and say that we didn't tip him... I understand his fear because if I was as bad as he was I would think I wasn't getting anything either. Regardless, I felt that was incredibly rude.  In general the food is good, but not worth the frustration.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=220

The last few times I've been here we've been seated quickly but had to wait about an hour for our food. This visit was no different. My family and I were seated promptly on a Saturday morning for an early lunch. The place was pretty empty with only a few tables occupied since they had only been open about 30 minutes. We had to ask for our water and beverages repeatedly. Our food took an hour to arrive and when it came they had forgotten my 3 year old's pizza. Our order consisted of a few egg dishes a burger and my daughter's pizza - not a complicated order and not one that should take an hour to prepare when only a few tables are seated. Furthermore, how can you forget a child's meal? They are the most important customer! By the time her pizza arrived we were finished eating and she had filled up on bread and fries. People that sat down after us were served before us - including a child with pizza! The server was replaced after the forgetting of the pizza situation and I believe he had messed up many orders and may have been sent home. We're done with this place and will just go to Brio or Yardhouse next time. Definitely not child friendly when you have to wait an hour to eat and fill up on bread waiting.

The first time was a disaster, with just my mom and I, it took the waiter(who barley checked up on us) almost one hour to take our order. No kidding. He kept saying the kitchen is busy but from what I could tell, the restaurant wasn't all that full. The food that came was bland and just a bad experience overall.  The second time seemed to be much better, with the order being taken right away(by a waitress who was in training, no less) and the food came out just in time. The second time, my entire family was with me, which includes my brother and my dad. However, one bothering thing was that there was a hair found in my dad's fish taco(which was pretty bland) and so the waitress automatically offered an apology, and brought a whole new plate of fish tacos out, free, of course. She said she was going to get the manager, but he never came. Not sure why we needed him anyways, since she managed it just fine. Overall, a decent experience.   The most recent time, the food came out at lightning speed and it tasted great too. It was me, my brother, and my mom, and we all had a great time. The waiter was really attentive, and even cracked some fresh black pepper into my caesar salad. The pastas my brother and I ordered were out of this world and my mom loved the veggie burger with the fries that were really crunchy. One thing that did bother me though, was that the waiter didn't really introduce himself fully into AFTER taking our order since he was so busy rushing the table's essentials such as ketchup and napkins.

That came to truth on my further visit to this newly opened restaurant of delights (10/20/11, according to our jolly waiter). I waited for a half hour before a fairly attractive receptionist guided me to the booth I requested. A booth next to the bar where I could see pretty much everything. That was when I discovered why the wait was so long - the patrons were chatty as teen-aged socialites and the waitstaff seemed to be clunky. That can only mean one thing! The kitchen is distributing fantastic food at the speed of tortoises trapped in quicksand. I've noticed that people like to talk more if the food is truly awesome. When that is combined with an overburdened kitchen, then there will be long waiting lines. Aha! I am a mathematical genius full of concerns on culinary efficiency. I digress. That burger with pulled pork really did hit the spot at 12.50$. The finest pork I've had this December, as a matter of fact. It was the sauce, however, that really got me. It was like this sweet and salty ninja that creeped into my taste buds. The burger kinda reminded me of a gourmet sloppy Joe's sandwich.  Also, there was this peculiar, yet delectable appetizer that a fellow patron ordered between the two of us. Artichokes with two separate sauces. There was a bunch of peeling involved, so I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who had their fingers sliced off by pirates. Otherwise, you can just dig your digits in and dip each cut into the sauces. It was a healthy and appetizing course.  No, I will not yelp about their cheesecakes. They are all too joyful to include in this report. Just pick them by yourselves.  Aside from the lethal waiting times, I was impressed by this new Cheesecake Factory. If I had the power to do so, I would award a medal to their bathrooms.

Arnold F.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",1,37,,1.0,5/8/2015,Stopped by one evening and walked in for dinner. The place was not full was taken to a table immediately. Was shown a table but asked for a booth the host looked puzzle and made up every excuse not to give us one.  I persisted as the restaurant was half empty. Then was finally directed to a booth. Sat down and waited for waiter. He showed up 10 minutes later. We ordered drinks   Then we ordered entrees. I asked him what he suggested on menu.  He was bewildered.  Not familiar with menu.  He then blurted out some pasta dish. We waited 40 minutes.  And we did not receive any service.  We were totally ignored.  He passed by our table and looked surprised that we were still there.  He brought us our drinks. We asked him for water.  And he ignored us.  We were DISGUSTED with the service. We walked out. We noticed other tables with their food. Guess cheese cake factory treats people differently. We have a different president.  A shame things like this still happen in 2015.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=260

The last straw happened last week. I ordered a st Francis Cabernet. When I received the drink, I noticed it tasted different. When we paid the check, I asked the waiter which drink he served me.

The manager came to our table but my mom lied to him and said everything was just allright, but thank goodness, he could tell that she was telling a lie!  Therefore, he asked that waitress to stand in a corner while he looked for a replacement.   Now as far as food is concerned, I ordered the blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries: BIG MISTAKE!  The sweet potato fries were overfried and gross!  The burger was just okay.

For those who are worried about calories, they have an extensive menu of ""slim"" entrees. And there a ton of choices under $15.00.

The manager (Ben) is very accommodating and understanding of the true meaning of high-quality customer service.  I ordered a dinner to-go that unfortunately did not make it home with me, I was a little irritated as I was assured by my waitress that everything was there and I was charged accordingly. Upon realizing that my husband's dinner never made it home I contacted the restaurant at once. I spoke with the manager on-duty (Ben) who apologized profusely, accepted responsibility and removed the item along with my desserts as an added incentive. I was especially surprised at the latter as this form of customer service is long gone and unheard of in our ""feed 'em and street 'em"" dining environment. This form of upmost, high-quality customer service proves to be the best form of advertisement as I was especially pleased and would return on any occasion.

Although the waittress was very nice, she did not do what she should have done to make good on the meal. My Mom ordered a vege-burger from the health-conscious menu. She really didn't enjoy it after it fell apart (and it wasn't all that good to begin with). She told the waittress this, but her response was ""I guess you'll have to eat it with a fork"", instead of ""would you like me to get something else for you?"". The couple next to us also had an issue with their salmon and their waiter offered them something else and voluntarily had the manager come over to offer his apologies.

Appetizers came out at the same time as our meal.  2. We asked for separate plates and never received them 3. Asked for ketchup 5 times and only received it once we saw a bus boy passing thru, so we asked him. 4. We order 4 meals and only 3 came out because she never ordered it. 5. We order a small hamburger and it was burnt, completely burnt. we tried eating around the burnt areas but it was horrible.  We told EBONY about it and asked her if we could speak to the manager so they could replace it or take it out the bill. We waited 20 minutes and The manager never came to our table and she stated that the manager said that because we had taken some bites of the burnt hamburger that they couldn't do anything about taking off the bill.  And we were fine with that so we asked could they replace it because we were hungry. We also asked about the meal that had never came out and she excused herself as if it had been order but it wasn't. So We waited for our meals and once it came out (15 minutes later ) we decided to just take it home. BUT Once we got home we noticed the hamburger they had replaced, was completely raw and uncooked. Even though the service was horrible, we still tipped her 15% . Our bill was $100.

I read a lot if these reviews and honestly people if you dont want to wait dont go out on a weekend or holiday to a popular restaurant with 5+ people. The average family is 4 and they have to wait what makes anyone think that 7 to 8 people wont!?!  Food is delish. One guy in here complained about the calorie count. REALLY?? So stay home and cook. Its the cheesecake factory they cook with butter and sauces and other scrumptious stuff! I've seen the hostesses at this location get ripped because of the guests own fault. Oh you're a party of 2 get paged and like magic have a giant stroller with you or a kid you didnt count. Ive gone with and without children. They're people!!! They need to sit- they count!! Ive had good and bad servers but that's to be expected sometimes. But there are some that go above and beyond for you.   A heads up would be avoid friday nights, sat after 6 and sunday nights- guess why...its the weekend its busy.  CcF is in a mall with a movie theater with popular stores. I like Tuesdays if im in a rush.   The cheesecakes are to die for. The drinks not too strong cause its a family restaurant but the Typhoon is strong! Can't beat happy hour 4-6! I Love the buffalo blasts the potstickers the nachos each like 5 bucks I add a peach smoothie then can go straight to sleep!  Overall Portions are huge and prices for those portions great! The most expensive dish is the filet mignon its 25 bucks. Like 25 is the most you can spend on one dish. If thats too much stay home!  Well thats my honest review I feel people should never complain when they had options to go else where or stay home. These people are obviously doing something right. They're still the busiest restaurant in Ridge Hill.  (I ate tonight- 2 of us patiently waited 20 minutes and i had the chicken costelleta and he had the jamaican  chicken combo. Dr peppers.

Ann F.,"Bronx, NY",0,8,,1.0,11/3/2014,"WORST BRANCH! DEPT OF HEALTH SHOULD VISIT!!! Let me list down my reasons: MUSHY CHEESECAKE, BURNT FRIES, AND CREEPERS ON YOUR TABLE. 1. When this was newly open, my husband and I were very excited since we didn't have to go farther to white plains or palisades, but the first time we had ordered cheesecake here, the cake was mushy. The texture felt like the cake has been out from freezer for too long. The female manager at the time apologized and replaced it, but it was still mushy  2. I love cheesecake factory so we gave it another try. The following time i ordered a burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were burnt. I am not someone to complain about how food taste but sweet potato fries is one of my favorite side dish. I told our server who informed a heavy set male manager. Mgr explained to us that their fries come out like that all the time. He said that they were using some new cooking oil. I insisted that i have been a customer of cheesecake factory in several branches and also had sweet potato fries in other restaurants and never was I ever served burnt fries. Instead of serving me a new cup of fries, he took the one I had, came back in less than 2 mins and told me that he got me new set of fries. I didn't eat the fries anymore because they were the same burnts fries. I was a bit insulted, did he really think I was going to believe it?!?  3. Final straw! My sister in law wanted to celebrate her bday dinner at cheesecake. We waited for 1.5h for our seats. When we finally got seated and having coffee, a cockroach crawled on the table near my coffee. I caught the crawler with the napkin and showed it to the current manager (oct 12, 2014) he took the napkin with crawler and moved us to another table as his solution. This place is at its worst. Never will I come back or invite nor encourage anyone to eat here at this branch. The managers need serious training!

Our server, Chris was awesome- he was very cool and friendly. There was a lot of seating in and outdoors. All of the options on the low-cal menu are under 600 calories and everything we tried was pretty good! I had the pear & blue cheese flatbread appetizer (delicious!) and the soft shell tacos (shrimp). So I skipped the shells, they were falling apart and so thin they couldn't hold all of the insides in place and the spanish rice was a little bland, but other than that it was pretty satisfying.  I also tried one of the chicken samosas- I was not too crazy about them but they were okay. As hard as I tried, I couldn't make it out the darn door without the ultimate red velvet cheesecake. This stuff is like a drug but it's okay. It's only the SECOND HIGHEST CALORIC DESSERT ON THE MENU (beaten out by the PB cheesecake by 10 cals). whatever, I'll feed off of it for a week.

Had strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  Only complaint was service was slow and the food was expensive. Our bill was over $70.00 for two people. That includes two glasses of wine at $7.00 each and two slices of cheescake.  We wanted to take one slice of the cheesecake home because we were full. We asked for a take home carton but the server never came back after we payed the bill. After waiting awhile and not seeing our server anywhere, we had to leave to arrive on time for our other plans we had that day. So, we had to leave that half of cheesecake on the table. I was a bit annoyed by that. The two stars are for the price of the portion size of the meal compared to other restaurants I have visited. The rating also takes into account the slow and ultimately poor service at the end of the meal.

Grace C.,"Yonkers, NY",0,4,,3.0,5/27/2012,"Okay, so maybe five hours ago I would've given this place a 4-star rating (Yay! I'm a fan) but after this evening, I'm sticking to a 3-star rating (A-OK) and I'm not giving this place a 1 because one of the waiters came to our rescue for the second time (thank you, Anthony!!!) and I've had good experiences at this Cheesecake Factory (with minor mishaps) before. The Cheesecake Factory should give Anthony a promotion because he is very attentive (to people like us who have been waiting for twenty-five minutes for our waitress to tend to us). He wasn't even in charge of our table and he was the only one who had the decency to tend to us. Bravo, Anthony!  Anyway, we waited forty minutes to be seated and granted it was Sunday afternoon, we were okay with that and we're use to it when it comes to this particular Cheesecake Factory. Okay, so we were seated and that is when my perception of this place spiraled downward!! (I use to love coming here). My husband and I were so mad because after being ignored for twenty minutes, we decided to speak to a manager. Was she any help? NO!! She assured my husband that she would take care of it but she didn't do anything about it, Anthony did!! She continued to avoid our table and even spoke to the people at the table next to us, who were having service issues with the waitress who was supposed to tend to us. The lady next to us told us, ""You didn't miss out on anything."" The manager didn't even look at us, no apology, NOTHING. I get it, it was busy, but after someone is seated, IT'S GAME TIME!  Moving on to the food. I always order the Americana Cheeseburger, no pickles (because with the pickles the burger turns out too salty), no onions (because when they do put grilled onions, they put waaaaay too many and that completely overpowers the other flavors), no tomatoes because I just prefer it that way and medium-well. Usually (not all the time) the burger turns out great, but tonight, I guess they just didn't have their game face on. It was a little bland. I ordered it with the sweet potato fries and they were too soft all around (they're supposed to be crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside). I guess they were sitting out for too long. The sweet potato fries here are hit or miss. Half of the time I have to send them back and get a new batch. Sometimes they are overcooked, sometimes cold.  I think this place has a lot of potential but management, I think, needs to get more involved and some of the staff need to be re-trained (except for Anthony). There is one manager who is very attentive though. He would've solved the problem right away, but this blonde short-haired woman, didn't care enough to make it up to us. Actually, since she told my husband she would take care of it during their conversation, my husband told Anthony to ask her, how was she going to take care of it. All she could do by the end of our meal was give us a free cheesecake and not charge us for my daughter's ice cream who was growing very impatient during our almost two hour wait. (I always tell her to remain calm though). Sorry lady, cheesecake is not going to solve your lack of hospitality sense. I decided to go with the red velvet which is good but too sweet. I love sweets but they have to be well-balanced. I have had the Godiva cheesecake, which I really recommend!! Not in this Cheesecake Factory though. Luckily, we got out right on time for our parking to be free (not a big deal but a good perk!). They validate but you're lucky if you get out on time. Just bring $3.25 just in case. We will not be returning. Sorry Cheesecake @ Ridgehill, we really did want to like you. We tried like six times and each time the service lacked more and more. Hope this helps fellow Yelpers!  *They do brunch on Sundays but I've never tried the food. I've also tried the Four Cheese Pasta and the Avocado Eggrolls and both are really tasty. Their vanilla milkshake is good and their whole wheat bread (before the meal) with the accompanying butter is really good.  *Their lemon-herb chicken is okay and their chicken bellagio is nothing to write home about. *I didn't like their orange chicken.  I've had other things but I forgot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=300

Everything that could possible go wrong did!  This place had me near tears for my birthday, ruined it. We were a table of 2, and were told our wait would be a half hour- 45 minutes, which is common on a Sat night. An hour and half passed and I ask a hostess if we were up soon and she said ""uh, yeah"". Fast forward a half hour later, and we still were not seated. I went up to another host and demanded to know why we were still waiting for 2 hours for a table for 2, he had no idea why our names were suddenly off the waiting list. Meaning that we could have waited until closing and would have never gotten a table! We were finally given a table and had to wait close to 10 min for a waiter to see us and give us water, and take our orders. We ordered drinks and got the wrong drinks, had to send them back. We ordered appetizers, and they never came. As we were waiting 20 minutes for the appetizers, the entrees came out! So our waitress said sorry and tried to take the entrees off our table and go get the appetizers. That makes NO sense because by now the appetizers would have been cold, and they would have left the entrees out as we ate the cold appetizers. We canceled the appetizers. Finally, we could enjoy some food, right? WRONG!!!! I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Pasta, and it was missing two main ingredients, at the point I was seriously upset. I sent the dish back, and when it came back, it came back cold and I could tell they just added the 2 missing things and tossed it around. The manager finally came out, and offered us a free dessert...at that point I just asked for it to go and left as fast as I could.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service.

Laureen R.,"Yonkers, United States",29,122,13,2.0,6/3/2017,I had a Dr. Appointment at 7PM on a Tuesday and I was early so I went to TCF to grab a quick bite.  I asked for a table for one and the host staff clearly seemed annoyed.  They gave me a set in the bar area which was a huge mistake.  I ordered a cucumber mojito to start followed by a small side salad and an appetizer and asked that they be served at the same time.  Needless to say the salad came out LONG before my drink ever got there.  I wanted my drink prior to any food.  Then it took another 15 minutes for the appetizer to appear.  The guy serving me was nice enough but they had him waiting on tables on the other side of the restaurant in addition to the bar area.  Since he can't physically be in two places at once....how could the service possibly be good?  It wasn't a great experience.  Next time I will try Angelo's and just get some cheesecake from TCF to go and not sit down.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=60
Sarah L.,"Manhattan, United States",0,5,3,1.0,14/2/2017,"DO NOT EAT HERE! This place deserves zero stars. On February 4th, 2017 I ate here with my family, and at first everything seemed fine, but starting that night, and since then I have been battling a chest infection which has now turned into bronchitis. I'm currently on a behind-the-counter medication recommended by my local pharmacist, but I will most likely have to go to another doctor's appointment to get a prescription for an albuterol asthma inhaler for my worsening condition. The quality of service and level of sanitation in this restaurant has decreased significantly since it's been opened, and I know because over the past few years I have been here several times. We also had an issue with one of our orders and the manager was unhelpful in resolving the issue; she lied and said that we said something completely different! This caused us to be delayed for over a half hour while my brother was waiting for his food.  I have since contacted the Cheesecake Factory corporate office via their website and it's been several days and I still haven't heard from them.

But I can't in good conscience give a bad experience a pass. My wife and I were celebrating our 14th wedding anniversary. This is the fourth or fifth Cheesecake factory I have been to, I figured you can't go wrong. Boy was I wrong. To start with, my Bluemoon draft beer was ""flat"". Either it was poured wrong or the tap/line was dirty. The service was decent, but the main dishes were pretty bad. My wife always orders the same dish- the chicken farfalle with roasted garlic. This time the panchetta was burned black and made the entire dish  taste like a charcoal bricket. The cream sauce was very watery and had not been reduced properly and the dish was quite salty. My dish was pretty good. I ordered the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi. The mashed potatoes were salty and cold and it came with three large shrimp and three medallions of steak which was cooked exactly as requested (the meat was lacking salt). The cheesecake was great, especially their new salted caramel. On our way out my wife and I used the rest rooms. Both were out of toilet paper, filthy and the mens room had a special surprise. Either someone had an accident or they used the bathroom and realized there was no toilet paper and left a pair of dirty underwear in the stall to accompany the pissed on toilet seat and soggy floor. Overall the ambience of the restaurant is nice and the area where it is located is incredibly nice. But they need to get their act together and the cooks have to maintain high quality standards and management needs to ensure that the bathrooms are checked on regularly because it is such a busy restaurant.

cedes w.,"JAMAICA, United States",2,66,3,1.0,12/6/2016,"My husband, mother, children and I visited the cheesecake factory at Ridgehill this past week. We visited due to my husband's birthday and my daughter's graduation (This was my husband's first time at any cheesecake factory). From the beginning, I was disappointed with the service and quality of the food. As it being a weekday (Tuesday), it wasn't very busy and we were seated almost immediately outside (upon our request). EVERY SINGLE THING we wanted, I had to call the waiter over to get. I had to find him to get our appetizers in, call him over to get our drinks ordered, request water, ask for him to come so we could get our entree order in. He simply neglected our table. When it got a little chilly, we asked for the heater to be turned on. When the heater turned off, we asked the waiter to turn it back on. He said okay but walked back inside. We had to request the manager when he walked by to help us and turn it on. To add insult to injury half of the time, the waiter was just standing around at the other end of the patio. One other thing that bothered me was that I asked for a glass of water and I told him it was my husband's birthday and I would like for him to get sung happy birthday at the table. He said okay. The food came (much smaller portions than the Nyack and White Plains location) and we finished. He came and just gave us the bill. There was no asking of if we wanted dessert, no asking if we wanted anything else and certainly no happy birthday for my husband. I became infuriated because once I gave him my card he literally stood next to our table eyeing the tip. So lets recap, I had to ask for everything for our meal, you never returned regarding our heater, and didn't sing happy birthday as I requested. We will never be returning to the cheesecake factory at this location ever again. People come to the cheesecake factory for a delicious special meal to share with friends and family.

My review will be solely based on the recent visit this past Sunday.  After leaving the apple store (right across from CCF) we went into the cheese cake factory and we were told the wait was 40-45 mins. Idk what 5 minutes difference would have done but my family (party of 6) and I agreed. It was 5:30pm.. We were given a little alarm lighting device that will tell you when your table is ready; we got distracted with other people and the children in our party that we failed notice that the time was 6:56. Hmm ok, we ask how much longer and they tell us that there's one party in front of us. Ok.  Finally the darn thing rings at 7:02. We are shown our seats and about 5 minutes later our server approaches us.. And asks what we would like to drink, party of 6 says what they are drinking and he's not taking notes. We get distracted again and notice we haven't received water or their delicious bread.. The server comes back and I shout, we are ready to order appetizers, now he takes the note pad and writes down the appetizers and asks us to tell him our drinks again.  appetizers, arrive 30 mins later and still no bread or water. By this point I'm upset, I hate waiting so long after being seated. I stop one of the girls in the black uniform and tell her I want to speak to the manager. The manager arrives fairly quickly and everyone in the table looks at me to spill my feelings of angry, Spanish, hungry woman! And I do that.  I begin stating that the wait to be seated was long, the wait for the bread was long, we haven't received water and the time is now 7:45. He was very nice, that one star is for him. Lol he told us that is not the servers fault, they were out of bread and they were out of glasses for drinks, that he had to make the drinks himself. -_- my drink, passion fruit mojito... Watered down, but I was more interested in the food. The manager tells us that he will make sure everything is smooth from here on out. Ok.  Our food arrived 8 something, food was ok, but I couldn't enjoy because I was upset lol i finished my plate steak Diane & mash and told the waiter that I was ready for dessert, I order my cheese cake & tell him we are ready for the bill. The bill arrives and I couldn't take it anymore, I got up and paid at the front little desk and waited and took my cheesecake to go. Smh!

Sarah H.,"Los Angeles, United States",0,6,,1.0,28/4/2015,"I have been a regular at this Cheesecake Factory for the past three years. I have had all of my birthday dinners there. I don't really mind the mediocre service or wait times because I love the food there and, at this point, it's a tradition. I went there on Sunday for my 22nd birthday party. We were seated outside and it was very cold, I ended on wrapping myself up in a hammock to stay warm, but I didn't mind... that's how much I love the Cheesecake factory. My actual birthday, the next day, Monday, a series of terrible things happened making this one of the worst birthdays I've had. My girlfriend's computer crashed (we are seniors at Sarah Lawrence College during our finals week) and I ended up spending a lot of the day with her at the apple store trying to find a solution. To cheer up, before we went home, she suggested a cocktail at the Cheesecake factory. We went to the bar and my waiter from the night before recognized me. ""Hey birthday girl!"" he said, before leaving the bar. I explained that today was my actual birthday so I was just coming in for a drink. The bartender took mine and my girlfriend's IDs, after looking at them for approximately 3 seconds, decided ""neither of these are real,"" throwing them down on the counter and walked away. I called him back over and asked him to scan it or enter it in the computer because it was, in fact, my actual license. He pulled out an ID guide book and told me that my ID should be horizontal if I was 21 (it's a South Carolina ID because I'm a student at Sarah Lawrence, from South Carolina originally). I explained that I had gotten it shortly before I turned 21 since I had lost my old one and needed it replaced. It's vertical, but clearly says ""UNDER 21 UNTIL"" my birthday last year. He asked if I had any other forms of identification that matched this name and I pulled out both of my debit cards and student ID, all clearly stating my name and the ID also had my photo and year at school. He walked away, and for a second I thought he was going to serve us, but it turns out he was just ignoring us and talking to one of the waiters.  At this point, I started to cry. It had already been a horrible birthday, now I couldn't even get a drink at my favorite restaurant. Not only was I not being served, the bartender was rude and condescending. Two men were also behind the bar and we asked if one of them was the manager. The manager came over, looked at our IDs, and still didn't believe mine was real. Let me just say, at this point, that I have never had any issue with this ID. It is my real South Carolina ID that clearly stated it was my 22nd birthday. The manager questioned that as well, holding back a laugh as he said he just ""wasn't so sure about this one."" I asked him to scan it. He didn't. The bartender then comes over, and says ""So you're from South Carolina, and you know Eli?"" I didn't know who Eli was, but he kept nodding to the back of the restaurant so I guess he was referring to the waiter who had recognized me when I walked in. My girlfriend tried to explain that I was here last night for my 22nd birthday, but at this point the bartender wasn't listening and was talking over us. We left, because at that point I was openly crying and didn't want to sit at a bar with these two jerks.  Maybe they didn't have a scanner. That's unfortunate. I just don't understand why they would think I would go to all of that effort if my ID was fake. Thank you for ruining my 22nd birthday, Cheesecake Factory. I have returned here even after shoddy service and many mistakes because I work in the service industry and know that a lot can go wrong in a restaurant. But both of these men were extremely rude and condescending to me just because I look young, refusing to serve me when I was using my valid license. I won't ever be returning to this Cheesecake Factory again. Their service has always been so-so, and this is the final straw.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=160

Shoshana R.,"Bronx, United States",30,96,311,4.0,24/12/2017,"I have visited this location multiple times (more then I care to admit) since it has opened. The mixed reviews are accurate, I have to admit there has been a noticeable decline in service and in some instances even food.  However, you have to give credit where credit is do. On this particular visit (12/22/17) my service was outstanding and that is due solely to BRANDON Q. This guy was on point. I usually come despite the service because it's close.  Customarily everyone here is blah blah and can careless about their jobs or more importantly the customers at times, but BRANDON was top notch and on point without being obnoxiously overbearing. To top it off it was during happy hour the weekend before Christmas when the volume of activity was noticeably increased quite a bit and he managed it all.  I was so impressed by the service Brandon Q. provided that I was moved to actually write a  review after all this time.  Full disclosure... this is not always the best location to visit. The time of day and week is a key factor in the type of service you may or may not receive.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers
Patricia H.,"Hartsdale, United States",1,61,,2.0,10/1/2018,"This Cheesecake Factory is not the best.   Interestingly enough, I had the same waitress who messed up the same order about two weeks earlier.  I crossed my fingers that she wouldn't mess it up this time. Well, not all wishes come true.    She was also on ""lunch break"" when the mess up happened.  She later said she entered it oddly in the computer... for the second time.  One of the people (who was not our waitress) delivering the food to our table had an attitude when I told her my order wasn't right.  I subbed my pasta for fries because I can't eat pasta.  Her eyes were rolling and she said that the kitchen didn't make that dish like that.... I told her I go there often so I know for a fact they do... She said well they change it daily... I just stared at her after that.  Eventually, she took the cue and took my food back to the kitchen.  It took 20+ minutes.  My date ate without me because I didn't want his food to get cold.  They comped our appetizer only because I asked to speak to a manager.   Our waiter then came back from lunch break and asked if we wanted cheesecake that was complimentary. We said EH OK.  She said she'd bring us a menu. She never did. Turns out when she realized the manager comped our appetizer - she just decided not to bring us a dessert menu.  Instead without us even saying a word - she said (20 minutes later), ""By the way, I just got the sense you didn't want the dessert so I decided not to bring the menu."" Again. I stared blankly.   It was just not a memorable experience.  I would think twice before going to this particular location. 2 stars for the other waitress who helped out while our waitress was on a lunch break and the fact that parking is comped.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers

They suck and need to be refreshed on what it takes to run an effective and excellent shift. Let's start with basics; customer service, cleanliness, attention to detail, food safety and quality(temping), and properly training your FOH and BOH staff. These are the basic fundamentals to customer retention and satisfaction and the main ingredient in revenue growth! I work in upper management for QSR and let me tell you, what I experienced is so subpar and unacceptable. If I was given one month at this establishment I'd turn it around 360.

The service was a sold 4 stars. The food is what makes it goes down. I ordered Southern fried catfish and it was ok. The fish itself was fried super hard it was burnt. The sides was mashed potatoes, green beans and sautéed spinach. The spinach had more flavor than the beans. The mashed potatoes had a whole freaking potato in it like it was so hard to push down on it. Why doesn't the hostess know if there are any deals?

The often talked about wait times are almost unbearable on weekends, but you can't be mad at a restaurant for being popular. As annoying as the wait times are, that has no bearing on my rating. What really bothers me is the level of incompetence when they're NOT busy. Missing complimentary bread, dirty dishes and silverware, fruit flies, slow kitchen, and waitstaff that go missing for extended periods of time. I wish I could say they food is their saving grace, but as expansive as their menu is, almost everything I've tried is over salted, over cream-sauced, over cooked, and over portioned. Some dishes worth trying: Louisiana Chicken Pasta Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps Hibachi Steak Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Shrimp Scampi Some dishes to avoid: Carbonara Pasta Avocado Egg Rolls Steak Diane Chicken Madeira Chicken and Biscuits Southern Fried Catfish As you can see, I've eaten here more than I care to admit.

We walked in at 5:30 on a Monday afternoon and see the restaurant not very full and yet we are asked to wait 20-25 minutes to get a table set up. The waiters got confused on who was serving us as we got approached by 2 people within 3 minutes to greet us.  We ordered a cocktail. We ordered some small plates and we got an item from the kids menu. We requested spaghetti and meatballs from the kids menu. We ended up with a kids mac n cheese after being told that they ran out of kid sized meatballs. ??? So why did the table over clearly had an adult entree of a spaghetti and meatballs? Why can't they give kids the adult sized meatballs? The bathroom was full of paper towels and toilet liners. There was no toilet paper in the restroom so I proceeded to the ladies at the front desk to ask them to help find someone who can help me out. She couldn't leave her post to get it for me but will do when her colleague returned. Guess what? She came back with her colleague and didn't get the toilet paper. I asked the other woman at the front desk and she said, oh you need toilet paper? I think my colleague went to get it. No she didn't. She was socializing with a male waiter! What? What?  Our server Mark was accommodating therefore the 2 stars.  Finally, we ordered Taylor tots that never came. They said it's because the order went to the wrong table. 20 min later it still hasn't arrived. We took it off the bill. No questions asked. I feel like the staff is ok with this kind of mess up and know how to take it off the bill for the customer.

In fact, there was a lady ahead of her waiting to just pick up her order that was on the counter. They both waited 10 minutes before someone helped them. Apparently there were 3 people working and two were just sitting there chatting while one was actually busting her butt working. When we get home my ahi tuna salad with avocado has no avocado and has about 4 pieces of lettuce. I thought this was suppose to be a salad not garnish.

The server (Kai M.), although he tried to be nice, was AWFUL.  We had to ask for our beverages 3 times.  Only one of our two apps came out (the sweet potato fries, which were the best things we tried that night).  Twenty minutes later, our main meal came out - still no second app (the shrimp spring rolls).  The steak Diane was ordered medium rare and came out well done.  The mashed potatoes were like a mountain of cold paste.  The mahi mahi was horribly overcooked - we were so frustrated, we sent that back and decided to just wait for the spring rolls as a main dish.  Once the server realized how frustrated we were, he avoided us like the plague.  The spring rolls finally arrived (still waiting for our beverages) and were actually pretty good.   To get the check, we actually had to stand up and put our coats on and just stand there, hoping the server would walk by.  Upon receiving the bill, the mahi (which we did not eat) was still on the bill, so we had to wait for it to be removed.   Awful awful experience here which was very disappointing, as we rarely get a family night out like that.  As a former server myself (having done it for ten years when I was younger), I can say that this is clearly a terribly managed restaurant in need of radical change.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=200

The starter bread was good as a starch lover. Pumpernickel?  The service was good and decor a bit much but it was classier than I expected for a mid range restaurant.

Katie S.,"New York, United States",201,236,299,2.0,26/12/2016,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations, and this is one of the worst. When it is crowded, service is incredibly slow.  My party of four spent almost 2 hours there for lunch today, and no one apologized for or even acknowledged our 35 minute wait between clearing our appetizers and delivering our entrees.  This location also has cleanliness issues. I encountered a piece of chocolate cheesecake on the floor on my walk to the bathroom, and then the bathroom itself was dirty (and there was no soap in the soap dispenser) despite the fact that I passed a bathroom attendant on her way out as I was entering.  The food itself seems to be on par with other Cheesecake Factory locations. Cheesecake options abound! Finally, we've ordered dinner to go from here on many occasions, and the pick up process is very slow. Because there's no separate pick up like for to go orders, you have to wait behind people making their cheesecake selections, which can take a long time. Food is also sometimes not ready in the window they've told you over the phone, so then you're stuck waiting while your car is parked in the to go area.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=20
Ernest T.,"Parkchester, Bronx, United States",44,30,18,2.0,24/8/2017,I was very disappointed with how this location was managed on a Saturday night.  The staff did not appear to be prepared to service the crowd. In general I like the Cheese Cake Factory.  I do not like this location.  The wait time to be seated exceeded what the host provided.  The waitress made it clear that she was over worked and struggling to keep up with the crowd.  I had to ask for things multiple times it was provided.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=20
Renee R.,"Manhattan, United States",3,69,94,1.0,5/7/2017,"Ok let's start off by saying this: my server was really nice and she was just simply overwhelmed with how busy the restaurant was. When I spoke to the Mgr he was a total moron who knew the place was bad with service and there was nothing he could do to manage it because he has no manager skills clearly. He didn't even give a crap when I told him your service in the kitchens are horrible. But let's begin. Went in with my friend and our 3 kids. Ordered kids meals an app plus our food. Kids meals were wrong they brung out only the protein that was ordered but everything else was wrong wrong and wrong. They get their food & it's loaded with pepper. Like rediculously spicy and peppery for 5 year olds (and my kid loves hot sauce) asked for ranch instead we get ketchup. His grilled chicken was pathetic it was like 4 bites of a chicken. By the time 2/3 kids were half way done the 3rd child meal comes along. Mind you weve been there 45m at this time My friend and I are waiting and waiting for our meals. After an hour we ate all our app and starting to really lose it. Hour 15 goes by kids are over the whole experience they're done eating and losing their patience. No crayons or anything to entertain while we painfully wait for our food. Hour and a half later we ask her wth where's the food?? She explains Someone took mine to the wrong table and had her salad sitting under a hot light for 30mins. Asked if we wanted to wait for them to remake mine obviously the answer was a hell no way!!! We pack my friends salad which was hot and sitting around for 30mins which I don't think she should have had to pay for. We paid for everything literally everything expect my meal since it never came. And that was that we waited 2 hour, we spent $75 on 3 kids meals which were garbage a wilted salad that sat waiting to be served for over 30mins and chips w/guac .  Thanks Cheesecake Factory that was the SHITTIEST EXPERIENCE EVERRRRRRRRR!!!! You really take the crown on that one. Next time we waste our drive from NYC to ridge hill we'll be sure to ignore your restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=20

Drinks- I had the carribean cooler and a Sangria, my friend Annette had the blueberry mojito, my friend Janine had the blood orange mojito. All the drinks were delicious and not too strong.  Dinner- I had the crispy shrimp sandwich (loved it and would def get it again), Annette had the chicken piccata, Janine had the grilled steak tacos. Food was cooked well, came out in a timely manner and tasted great. The waiter Johan was extremely helpful since my friend Annette had a lot of questions lol he was very patient.

The costumer service was up to date back then, Even the food had a better taste.  The second time i went to this place it was packed. We still go a chance to sit fast and the service wasn't that great. The food i would expect if to be really good since the first time i loved it but i was not impressed. They drinks were awesome always are. Plus the dessert is always on point. The waitress changed for some reason i don't know who's running the show now but i can tell u this its not the great service they use to serve. The third time coming to this place i kind of did not want to come in here but though i give it a try. Again this place was so packed some people had hours standing out side to get seated.

Me and a party of 4 decide to come here after the movies. Out of all the places to eat in ridge hill, we decided that Cheesecake Factory would be the icing on the cake tonight.  However, we were wrong. We waited 40 minutes to be seated, only to be treated with horrible service. My pasta had a burned smell and taste to it. The manager (Will) was called over and he admitted to having a burned smell. He had us order another entree of their menu, and that too had a burned smell to it. He gave us a complimentary cheesecake, however I know that he could've done more for us.  Customer service and referrals go a long way. Specially in a table of 4. My girlfriend loved that spot.

This time was no different, we all had the same comment it felt like someone just opened a bottle of salt on top of all our meals, the lemonades were also super sweet, the portion sizes are always generous so we all took food to go, I'm not sure I'd go back to Cheesecake Factory, I can eat better and have better service in smaller locations",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=20

Dominek T.,"New York, United States",456,303,408,3.0,13/6/2016,"Never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory and the food never wow'd me.  How can a restaurant have over 50 entrees available and be able to perfect them all?  That still boggles my mind.  The establishment itself is beautiful and the staff was kind and on top of their serving game. I had the gumbo but it was super salty and what it is interesting is they don't de-vein their shrimp. As much as they charge that should of been a given. Never the less I would come back if someone asked me to join them, but I rather spend my money on locally owned restaurant than large corporate chains.   I recommend make a reservation if you plan to come with large groups and if it is only two of you then just plant yourself at the bar for faster service.   Also,  Cheesecake Factory validates your parking for the first two hours.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=20

Yes, anyone that's eaten at any other Cheesecake Factory knows that the wait time is long. It isn't exclusive to this location and its not the fault of the staff/owners that the restaurant is popular, especially on the weekends. In terms of food, everything is mostly good. My guilty-pleasure food is the mac&cheese burger, although I try not to have it too often, for obvious, artery-clogging reasons. Ive never personally had an issue with the service at this location. Everyone has been mostly pleasant.

Our waitress was both courteous and helpful as she gave us plenty of ample time to decide our orders. The Cheesecake Factory is one of my absolute favorite restaurants as the menu options are many and the food (at least the entrees I've ordered) are always delicioso!  This time around, I ordered the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage Lunch Special and my mom ordered the Meatloaf Lunch Special. The portion that I received versus my mom's plate was dispproprotionate! My portion truly looked like the lunch special while my mom's looked like the full on dinner entree! My meal was delicious but I didn't get to take any of it home like my mom did because it was significantly smaller! That would be my only complaint!

My meal came out but only half of it. Mind you, I ordered shrimp and rice the easiest meal at the table. One of my friends ordered steak. My shrimp came out and then the waiter told me 30 secs for the rice, which was more like 8 mins. I was basically finished before my rice came out. She took over average lengths of time to come back to tend to the table. We even felt we were waiting too long to pay for our bill.

Sent it back, only to get it back still pink. No fuss, decided to stick with it anyway... it tasted like liver!! The mushrooms were good though. My boyfriend ordered the Bacon Bacon Burger, and everything was burnt (bun, patty, and bacon)... I mean charred. Even the fries were bad, as they were over salted (and I like salt).

Yes, the dishes can be repulsive, the menu is overwhelming, service is mediocre, and portion sizes are disturbingly large. It's a chain restaurant that represents much of what is wrong with this country - obese individuals perusing the menu with the 2000+ calorie salads and not batting an eye, then, they bring it home to enjoy as a late night snack. Now that I've said that, I also must say - I love it here. I hate myself for eating here, I really do, but if someone suggests it, I'm game. The buffalo blasters are the most gluttonous, mouth-watering, artery clogging appetizer I have ever enjoyed. In my perfect world, we could all eat buffalo blasters for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without ever having to worry about our skyrocketing cholesterol levels and collapsing life expectancy. Yes, they are that good - the pinnacle of appetizers. I've tried a number of entrees here, they all have the same theme - am I supposed to eat this by myself? Yes, you are. Buckle up and enjoy the ride. Each dish feels as if it was created for everyone to enjoy regardless of your particular taste nuances - from newborn baby to Michelin 3 Star Chef. The Cheesecake Factory isn't for everyone, but I can guarantee that anyone will be able to find something on the menu and enjoy - how can I hate on that?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=180

Between the wait (30 minutes) and the SLOW service, after 1 hour in the restaurant we had only been seated and given water. No one took our order until we had been there for an hour and a half! The food was mediocre - each entre had something wrong. Bland food, undercooked veges. A chicken and shrimp dish with no chicken. The ladies room was DISGUSTING. I don't understand why we keep going there. Next time, we'll order in chinese and get a big cheesecake combo from Costco, save a TON of money, and don't give this place our business.

Michael K.,"Wykagyl, United States",29,20,45,1.0,22/12/2013,"They refused to take a reservation for our party of 8 that included a special needs child that cannot spend a lot of time in his wheelchair. When I heard this, I asked if I could call ahead, they let us know how long the wait is and we'd plan accordingly. The manager refused and said since we were a large party we'd have to just show up. Well we get there and are told it's a 90 minute wait. It's Sunday night, we've been out all day and we're starving. So we wait. Luckily, it was 'only' 75 minutes but DD is done. He's uncomfortable and this wait hasn't helped.  The waitstaff was great in getting DD's food going first but he's ready to go home. He eats and my sister in law has take him to the van while we finish our dinner. $300 and she can't even enjoy the meal.  To be clear, we respected the no reservation policy. But I feel the workaround was more than fair. If we had known it was a 90 minute wait before we got there, my nephew could've come later and not have spent so much time in the wheelchair. There also would not have been the tension in our party and my sister in law would've been able to enjoy her meal.

Ramish S.,"Yonkers, United States",25,5,,4.0,13/11/2012,"I've been to this location 3 times since it opened(the most recent being 2 days ago) and I must say, each time I went, the place got better and better. The first time was a disaster, with just my mom and I, it took the waiter(who barley checked up on us) almost one hour to take our order. No kidding. He kept saying the kitchen is busy but from what I could tell, the restaurant wasn't all that full. The food that came was bland and just a bad experience overall.  The second time seemed to be much better, with the order being taken right away(by a waitress who was in training, no less) and the food came out just in time. The second time, my entire family was with me, which includes my brother and my dad. However, one bothering thing was that there was a hair found in my dad's fish taco(which was pretty bland) and so the waitress automatically offered an apology, and brought a whole new plate of fish tacos out, free, of course. She said she was going to get the manager, but he never came. Not sure why we needed him anyways, since she managed it just fine. Overall, a decent experience.   The most recent time, the food came out at lightning speed and it tasted great too. It was me, my brother, and my mom, and we all had a great time. The waiter was really attentive, and even cracked some fresh black pepper into my caesar salad. The pastas my brother and I ordered were out of this world and my mom loved the veggie burger with the fries that were really crunchy. One thing that did bother me though, was that the waiter didn't really introduce himself fully into AFTER taking our order since he was so busy rushing the table's essentials such as ketchup and napkins.

Marc Jansen B.,"Bronx, United States",76,93,1,4.0,27/12/2011,"Cheesecake factory. Killer prices and killer food (In both the positive and negative contexts). A lengthy wait, perhaps? That came to truth on my further visit to this newly opened restaurant of delights (10/20/11, according to our jolly waiter). I waited for a half hour before a fairly attractive receptionist guided me to the booth I requested. A booth next to the bar where I could see pretty much everything. That was when I discovered why the wait was so long - the patrons were chatty as teen-aged socialites and the waitstaff seemed to be clunky. That can only mean one thing! The kitchen is distributing fantastic food at the speed of tortoises trapped in quicksand. I've noticed that people like to talk more if the food is truly awesome. When that is combined with an overburdened kitchen, then there will be long waiting lines. Aha! I am a mathematical genius full of concerns on culinary efficiency. I digress. That burger with pulled pork really did hit the spot at 12.50$. The finest pork I've had this December, as a matter of fact. It was the sauce, however, that really got me. It was like this sweet and salty ninja that creeped into my taste buds. The burger kinda reminded me of a gourmet sloppy Joe's sandwich.  Also, there was this peculiar, yet delectable appetizer that a fellow patron ordered between the two of us. Artichokes with two separate sauces. There was a bunch of peeling involved, so I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who had their fingers sliced off by pirates. Otherwise, you can just dig your digits in and dip each cut into the sauces. It was a healthy and appetizing course.  No, I will not yelp about their cheesecakes. They are all too joyful to include in this report. Just pick them by yourselves.  Aside from the lethal waiting times, I was impressed by this new Cheesecake Factory. If I had the power to do so, I would award a medal to their bathrooms.

When I got there the wait was supposed to be an hour, which was fine since they have tons of drinks at the bar, but even the bar was packed. That was a problem, but suddenly some dude just asked if I needed a table. ""Yeah..."" 2 minutes later I was sitting down checking out the drink menu. That guy wasn't the server but I still ended up tipping him. CF has a bunch of specialty drinks to satisfy any alchie, and I noticed that they have some special low calorie menu, which I quickly dismissed.  The server was very much on point and she suggested some really good avocado egg rolls. Somehow as soon as the appetizers were finished the entrees came out--very memorable service. The Cajun jambalaya was...well, I'd like to have some right now, and the steak Diane with chicken Madeira(?) was absolutely drool worthy. Yeah, that was really good. The server I had was very important though, because she had to leave towards the end and the person who replaced her wasn't the same. Mind you, the replacement only had to bring a bill but there was a noticeable quality difference. The other great thing is that the location is excellent.

Dyanne S.,"Yonkers, United States",18,47,66,1.0,18/1/2016,"Just like any other cheesecake factory, they boast on their big decor. N thats all it is. Its basically an overpriced diner with salty horrible food. I never liked cheesecake factory due to the quality of its food but i been at ridgehill hundreds of time n never tried cheesecake factory n decided to give it a try n pop in for lunch. Worst decision ever. People actually pay to eat garbage. Their vietnamese rolls was stale, pot stickers was salty - taste like frozen food. My sister's food was too sweet n overwhelming, my hibachi steak was too salty n i asked for medium rare but my meat came out raw and tasted rotten. As though their meat been out to thaw over night. I returned the plate after 2 tiny bites. The waitress was friendly but obviously very new. She dont have the basics of customer service or serving skills. Upon getting the bill, i was charged for what i didnt eat. Just simply told her...u guys actually charge me for something i didnt eat? N she replied, oh i could take it off if u want. Its not about what i want, its logic. If a customer return a plate basically untouched, you takd it off the bill without having to ask.  Not worth it n definitely not coming back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=80

We spoke to her twice in regards to being seated.  Once we were seated, we asked the hostess to kindly offer us new eating utensils. This is what we always ask because if u have eaten at  Cheesecake Factory as many times as I've had, they always place utensils on the table and never on a napkin.  Hostess never brought us fresh utensils. We had to flag down a waiter because NOONE ever approached us. We informed Our waiter of the lack of service immediately. The waitress took our order and disappeared for half an hour. She also switched shifts with another waiter who had to take our orders over. Apparently our initial waitress went on lunch and ""forgot "" to tell our 2nd waiter. To add insult to injury, the second waiter was having a full conversation with another customer who came in way after me and my sister did . We cordially interrupted his conversation and asked to speak with a manager . This all occurred before we even had our actual meal.

I'm like I didn't realize the price difference , to which she replied "" do you want the plaque or not?"" It was rushed and super rude and I didn't have much time to think so I stuck with the plaque.

It's sad because the place is huge, gorgeous, and the food is mostly pretty good.  My favorite is the banana cheesecake.   This location is just mismanaged.  I'm not sure what the issue is but I do feel like it's waiter/waitress 101 to check on the table occasionally.  That isn't rocket science, is it? And also a few times I've gone, our waiters have tapped out to go on break, and someone replaces them yet they never come to us.  So we get left in limbo for x amount of time, plus the time the original waiter is on break.  It's absurd.  They would actually make MORE money if they moved tables through more quickly and could seat people sooner.   Last time we tried continuously to make eye contact and I feel like they were purposely not looking at us.  I guess I'll try another location but for this one, it's game over.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=260

We asked him for water.  And he ignored us.  We were DISGUSTED with the service. We walked out. We noticed other tables with their food. Guess cheese cake factory treats people differently.

For those who are worried about calories, they have an extensive menu of ""slim"" entrees. And there a ton of choices under $15.00.

We were a party of 6, with a 6 month old baby.  They waitstaff requested for us not to keep the stroller in the aisle - understandable.  However, they did not have a high chair that could accommodate a car seat, nor a chair that was safe for a child of that size.  We can't be the only people who have ever brought a child that small! For the 6 of us to have 2 rounds of drinks, 3 appetizers, and a bunch of burgers, it took over 2 hours from start to finish.  Mind you, this was at 7:30 on a Monday night - not exactly prime time dining. We were hoping to get in and out quickly to get the baby to bed, but so much for that. In regards to the service, very much like the others who have written about this location, the service was very slow.  Took at least 25 minutes to get our drinks after ordering, and 30 minutes after arrival to even put in our orders.  We had originally ordered 4 appetizers for table, and when only 3 showed up, we asked the waitress and she said ""oh, we didn't have any.  Don't worry, I took them off the bill"".  Really? We would have LOVED to have ordered another app to replace our original order, but by the time she asked we were already halfway through our appetizers and didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for one last dish.   For our meals, they brought out 5 out of 6.. the last, which was just some sort of chicken fingers, didn't come for 15 minutes.  The MOD was kind enough to take it off of our bill, but still.  We were all so annoyed by the time we finished our meals, we didn't even stay around for the birthday cheesecake we had originally come for.   Will NOT come back.

Kaylan N.,"Cortlandt, United States",0,5,,1.0,23/2/2013,"Tonight was by far the most horrible experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I've had bad experiences at this particular Cheesecake Factory before, but I keep on giving it a chance because I enjoy the food and the close proximity to my house.  Last time I went to the Yonkers Ridge Hill location, I ordered the chicken parm sandwich and they forgot to take out the layers of parchment paper before serving me the sandwich. I took a bite of my sandwich to find myself taking a bite of wax paper. The manager was very sorry and refired my order.  By the time I got a new sandwich, my whole table was done eating their meal. However, he did take the sandwich off the bill. Needless to say after twenty minutes of waiting, I asked for a box to take my food to go.  Tonight, we went to at 7:30. We walked up to the hostess and she said the wait would be 30-40 minutes. On a Saturday night at that time, we expected to wait for a little while. We waited for 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 1 hour and finally an hour and twenty minutes went by. I finally went up to check with the hostess after I saw several people that arrived after us be seated. The hostess looked in the computer and couldn't find our reservation at all. She said there was no record of our name or timer number. AFTER 1 hour and 20 minutes of waiting we weren't on the list! She quickly apologized and said we would be the next table seated. Then she proceeded to seat another table of two. As soon as we noticed this we brought it to her attention, she apologized again, and finally after 1 hour and 30 minutes, we were seated. We waited three times the promised wait time.  We get to our table and wait 5,10, 15 minutes. No one comes to greet us, take our drink order, nothing. I went up to the hostess station and brought this to her attention. I walked back to our table and someone came to the table to take our drink order, we said we were ready to place our whole order because we waited so long and were beyond starving, but we were quickly told ""I'm not your waiter, but I'll take your drink order.""  Finally, after almost 20 minutes of sitting at a table, the saving grace of our meal, Allan R. took our drink order. He was extremely apologetic and accommodating. Allan quickly took our order and got us our meal. Our food was very good. The manager took the appetizer off of our bill for our troubles. However, the fact that we had to wait 2 hours for a meal was completely unacceptable. The manager knew that they messed up with our reservation and said nothing. The manager knew that no one showed up at our table to take our order and only after the two hours of waiting did he approach us. He was very kind once he approached us and apologetic, but at that point, it was too late.  My fiancee and I frequent the Cheesecake Factory because of it's expansive menu and good food. However, these huge mistakes in customer service are far to frequent for my liking. We will not be returning to the Cheesecake Factory in Ridge Hill. By looking at the reviews on Yelp, it seems that this is a reoccurring problem. Perhaps corporate needs to take a closer look the customer service in the Yonkers Ridge Hill Cheesecake Factory because there are a lot of unacceptable issues. They got 1 star because Yelp doesn't allow you to give 0 stars. Save your cash and go to The Yard House.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=220

The ambience and decor sets you up for a calm relaxed evening out to dinner. Their menu suits all kinds of eating preferences from seafood, pasta, soup, chicken, beef ect.

Barbara R.,"Bronx, United States",30,58,1,1.0,20/9/2015,"I usually come to this place with family or friends , and the service is great . Tonight that wasn't the case, thanks to the poor service from our waiter. The bar was set low on how he communicated , upon the initial sit down greeting. Upon taking the order , he was less than enthused to make the modifications we asked for . My daughter wanted pizza, and guess what the place was out of pizza. I'm sure he knew this ahead of time, but giggling with his fellow colleagues was more interesting . Our food arrives, and the burger has the wrong cheese, medium well apparently , means rare! We bring this to his attention , and he saids well this the cheese it comes with? And it's a dollar extra so you know! Great customer service , I think not!! Never follows up with our table to ensure everything else is okay! Total highlight of the night , brings us the check, and continues to socialize with his colleagues . My daughter at this point is asleep at the table . We finally flag down another employee , so he can process the check.

The menu is very extensive and can be a bit overwhelming, but it is pretty good quality food no matter what the choice. It can get pretty busy so I would suggest planning accordingly. If you plan in going on a weekend expect to wait at least 15-20 min. There are several parking garages right by the restaurant, and you am have your parking validated, which is nice.

Natasha L.,"Yonkers, United States",0,4,5,1.0,30/7/2014,"The worst service I have ever experienced! The first few times I went, I didn't particularly mind the slow service, but the last few times I've gone were the final straw! I do not plan to ever go back. Here was my last experience: First I waited 2+ hours for a table when it was near closing time. Literally the entire restaurant was empty save for two people sitting in one section and one large party sitting in another section. Instead of just combining tables to get us seated quicker, they made us wait over 2 hours for the one large party to finish. At first I thought it was the group that was slow, but once we were seated I realized that it was clearly the incompetent wait staff.  They took so long to take our order, then when we finished, took even longer to bring the check after we had asked for it. At this point we were literally the ONLY people in the entire restaurant. They even turned on the lights and started cleaning up around us, and still would not bring out the check. They should have been eager to have us pay and leave.  When we finally did get the check our waiter somehow had trouble understanding that the credit cards were to cover the bill and the cash left over was the tip (and despite the terrible experience we were still generous and tipped 20%). He literally tried to stop us and say that we didn't tip him... I understand his fear because if I was as bad as he was I would think I wasn't getting anything either. Regardless, I felt that was incredibly rude.  In general the food is good, but not worth the frustration.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=220

The last few times I've been here we've been seated quickly but had to wait about an hour for our food. This visit was no different. My family and I were seated promptly on a Saturday morning for an early lunch. The place was pretty empty with only a few tables occupied since they had only been open about 30 minutes. We had to ask for our water and beverages repeatedly. Our food took an hour to arrive and when it came they had forgotten my 3 year old's pizza. Our order consisted of a few egg dishes a burger and my daughter's pizza - not a complicated order and not one that should take an hour to prepare when only a few tables are seated. Furthermore, how can you forget a child's meal? They are the most important customer! By the time her pizza arrived we were finished eating and she had filled up on bread and fries. People that sat down after us were served before us - including a child with pizza! The server was replaced after the forgetting of the pizza situation and I believe he had messed up many orders and may have been sent home. We're done with this place and will just go to Brio or Yardhouse next time. Definitely not child friendly when you have to wait an hour to eat and fill up on bread waiting.

June G.,"Manhattan, United States",36,36,10,2.0,12/9/2015,"While I absolutely LOVE the Cheesecake Factory brand, including Grand Lux Cafe, the location at Ridge Hill is abysmal. Initially, I thought their issues could be worked out over time, because every new establishment has to work out its kinks, but this location has now been operational for years. The Good - (1) the Ridge Hill location is super convenient and Cheesecake Factory is one of two businesses in the plaza that validate parking. (2) when the kitchen is on, they serve the usual Cheesecake Factory food well. (3) the bar seating is first come, first serve so often you can avoid the wait The Bad - (1) the kitchen is terribly inconsistent. Cheesecake Factory rests its entire reputation on its machine-like functionality and consistent quality across various locations. THIS location, however, is the only one that I've visited (of many nationwide) in which I never know what I'm going to get on my plate. They've messed up everything from basic Steamed Edamame to signature dishes like Chicken Madeira. (2) Management is constantly turning over so whenever I've had issues, the excuse is ""we have a new [insert restaurant unit] manager"" (3) they seem to be understaffed or don't manage the staffing schedule well - everything is a wait, even when they open.  Ultimately, this place will do business because of The Cheesecake Factory reputation BUT do not go expecting the typical CF experience or you'll be sorely disappointed",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=100

It doesn't seem so busy as there are many tables available yet there was a 50 minutes wait. No problem, we get a chance to do some more shopping while we wait.  We're greeted by our server who is very pleasant and brought us our appetizers in a flash. I'm eating my Crispy Cuban Rolls. They're quite flakey but at the same time very greasy.  They're not greasy enough for me not to dig in! As I take a bite into the third roll, I hurt my tooth. There is something unidentifiable in the roll. It appeared to be edible but not as hard as it was. I pointed it out to the server who brought a manager immediately. Apparently it was a piece of the pork's cartilage that the manager ""Mike"" explained should have never been there and agreed he too would be grossed out if it happened to him.  If it weren't for the server ""Johan"", I would've left immediately. I decided to stay and try the Tomato Basil Pasta.

Kids ordered the Tex Mex eggrolls with spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and melted cheese which came with a side of avocado cream and salsa. Came out piping hot and deliciously flavorful. We were nearly full from eating that dish alone. Hubby ordered California Avocado salad, which was a fair large size for the dish. For dinner, he ordered the California Cheesesteak, OMG! Sooo good- thinly sliced steak with sautéed mushrooms, onions, peppers and cheese on a soft toasted sourdough loaf. Of course, with a side of fries.  Avocado Eggrolls (appetizer) - They were crisp wrapper filled eggrolls with fried avocado (was so savory) with tomato, red onion and cilantro. I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp.  OMGGG! I was slightly overwhelmed with the generous amount of sautéed spicy shrimp on my plate, marinated with the mouth watering Jamaican spicy sauce. Other side dishes it was served were brown rice (my preference, but white was avail), black beans, and sweet plantains and cool mango salsa. I couldn't finish my plate, but ate it the next day and I swear it tasted even better.  We ended up taking ALL the food home actually, but couldn't leave without ordering dessert! We ordered the Carrot Cake Cheesecake - carrot cake and cheesecake together, with cream cheese icing and almonds and a Carrot Cake -layers carrot cake and cream cheese icing with shreds of carrots, spices, and faint minuscule-like pieces of pineapple.

Our entrees came, and the hamburger ordered medium came out looking like beyond well done.

The manager (Ben) is very accommodating and understanding of the true meaning of high-quality customer service.  I ordered a dinner to-go that unfortunately did not make it home with me, I was a little irritated as I was assured by my waitress that everything was there and I was charged accordingly. Upon realizing that my husband's dinner never made it home I contacted the restaurant at once. I spoke with the manager on-duty (Ben) who apologized profusely, accepted responsibility and removed the item along with my desserts as an added incentive. I was especially surprised at the latter as this form of customer service is long gone and unheard of in our ""feed 'em and street 'em"" dining environment. This form of upmost, high-quality customer service proves to be the best form of advertisement as I was especially pleased and would return on any occasion.

L E.,"Westchester, United States",31,100,,2.0,29/9/2012,"The good news is there isn't as much of a wait during peak hours as other CCFs and they cover the ridiculous parking fees charged by Ridge Hill Yonkers for the ""priviledge"" of shopping or eating there. The bad news is based on my experience (and on others in reading the reviews), this CCF still has some kinks to work through months after opening.  I took my Mom here for dinner on a Friday night. Although the waittress was very nice, she did not do what she should have done to make good on the meal. My Mom ordered a vege-burger from the health-conscious menu. She really didn't enjoy it after it fell apart (and it wasn't all that good to begin with). She told the waittress this, but her response was ""I guess you'll have to eat it with a fork"", instead of ""would you like me to get something else for you?"". The couple next to us also had an issue with their salmon and their waiter offered them something else and voluntarily had the manager come over to offer his apologies.  I had a small salad and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which although the pasta was overdone, was extremely tasty.  I think after this restaurant works through some issues, they will probably be fine.

sam s.,"Brooklyn, United States",0,3,,1.0,7/12/2014,"HORRIBLE SERVICE / HORRIBLE ATTITUDE  DISGUSTING FOOD!! I normally will never think of writing a review, but this service was atrocious. At first glance the waitress, EBONY was very nice, but we noticed she seemed rushed. She did not write our order down but we thought nothing of it at first. 1. Appetizers came out at the same time as our meal.  2. We asked for separate plates and never received them 3. Asked for ketchup 5 times and only received it once we saw a bus boy passing thru, so we asked him. 4. We order 4 meals and only 3 came out because she never ordered it. 5. We order a small hamburger and it was burnt, completely burnt. we tried eating around the burnt areas but it was horrible.  We told EBONY about it and asked her if we could speak to the manager so they could replace it or take it out the bill. We waited 20 minutes and The manager never came to our table and she stated that the manager said that because we had taken some bites of the burnt hamburger that they couldn't do anything about taking off the bill.  And we were fine with that so we asked could they replace it because we were hungry. We also asked about the meal that had never came out and she excused herself as if it had been order but it wasn't. So We waited for our meals and once it came out (15 minutes later ) we decided to just take it home. BUT Once we got home we noticed the hamburger they had replaced, was completely raw and uncooked. Even though the service was horrible, we still tipped her 15% . Our bill was $100. Hopefully one day the service will change and managers and waitress will realize that their lively hood depends on the customers.

Steph A.,"Yonkers, United States",0,3,3,5.0,18/10/2013,"I am brutally honest so here you go. This location is the closest to the city and in a busy shopping area;  so it gets very busy. I read a lot if these reviews and honestly people if you dont want to wait dont go out on a weekend or holiday to a popular restaurant with 5+ people. The average family is 4 and they have to wait what makes anyone think that 7 to 8 people wont!?!  Food is delish. One guy in here complained about the calorie count. REALLY?? So stay home and cook. Its the cheesecake factory they cook with butter and sauces and other scrumptious stuff! I've seen the hostesses at this location get ripped because of the guests own fault. Oh you're a party of 2 get paged and like magic have a giant stroller with you or a kid you didnt count. Ive gone with and without children. They're people!!! They need to sit- they count!! Ive had good and bad servers but that's to be expected sometimes. But there are some that go above and beyond for you.   A heads up would be avoid friday nights, sat after 6 and sunday nights- guess why...its the weekend its busy.  CcF is in a mall with a movie theater with popular stores. I like Tuesdays if im in a rush.   The cheesecakes are to die for. The drinks not too strong cause its a family restaurant but the Typhoon is strong! Can't beat happy hour 4-6! I Love the buffalo blasts the potstickers the nachos each like 5 bucks I add a peach smoothie then can go straight to sleep!  Overall Portions are huge and prices for those portions great! The most expensive dish is the filet mignon its 25 bucks. Like 25 is the most you can spend on one dish. If thats too much stay home!  Well thats my honest review I feel people should never complain when they had options to go else where or stay home. These people are obviously doing something right. They're still the busiest restaurant in Ridge Hill.  (I ate tonight- 2 of us patiently waited 20 minutes and i had the chicken costelleta and he had the jamaican  chicken combo. Dr peppers.

Ann F.,"Bronx, United States",0,8,,1.0,3/11/2014,"WORST BRANCH! DEPT OF HEALTH SHOULD VISIT!!! Let me list down my reasons: MUSHY CHEESECAKE, BURNT FRIES, AND CREEPERS ON YOUR TABLE. 1. When this was newly open, my husband and I were very excited since we didn't have to go farther to white plains or palisades, but the first time we had ordered cheesecake here, the cake was mushy. The texture felt like the cake has been out from freezer for too long. The female manager at the time apologized and replaced it, but it was still mushy  2. I love cheesecake factory so we gave it another try. The following time i ordered a burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were burnt. I am not someone to complain about how food taste but sweet potato fries is one of my favorite side dish. I told our server who informed a heavy set male manager. Mgr explained to us that their fries come out like that all the time. He said that they were using some new cooking oil. I insisted that i have been a customer of cheesecake factory in several branches and also had sweet potato fries in other restaurants and never was I ever served burnt fries. Instead of serving me a new cup of fries, he took the one I had, came back in less than 2 mins and told me that he got me new set of fries. I didn't eat the fries anymore because they were the same burnts fries. I was a bit insulted, did he really think I was going to believe it?!?  3. Final straw! My sister in law wanted to celebrate her bday dinner at cheesecake. We waited for 1.5h for our seats. When we finally got seated and having coffee, a cockroach crawled on the table near my coffee. I caught the crawler with the napkin and showed it to the current manager (oct 12, 2014) he took the napkin with crawler and moved us to another table as his solution. This place is at its worst. Never will I come back or invite nor encourage anyone to eat here at this branch. The managers need serious training! The servers are accommodating, but if the management tolerate this type of food and environment in front of customers, u can only imagine what goes behind close doors.

Princess R.,"Bronx, Bronx, United States",0,2,,1.0,13/7/2017,"My experience at this location yesterday wasn't very pleasant. I sat at a table with my family for at least 15mins before a server came and greeted us. When the server (Kiy) did greet us he introduced himself and said "" I guess I'm going to take this table because no one else is"". We then ordered three waters one with lemon and a Dr Pepper. Another 15mins went by and still no beverages. He approached the table and we jokingly said did you forget about us? He responses in telling us that they were no cups in the restaurant and that they were short a dishwasher. We told him it was okay to just give us the drinks in to go cups and ordered a pina colada, some apps and our food. 10mins after that he brings our drinks not including the pina colada (which I figured he was going to the bar to get so I didn't bring it up at that moment) or lemon for one of the waters. At this point we were annoyed and didn't want to ask our server for nothing more because it seemed like a bother to him as he continued to past our table and pay us no mind. The appetizers came out and were delicious but once our entrees came everything started going downhill again. Our food did not come out all together. When the last person got her food half of what she ordered wasn't there. We were told that it would be up in a second. 3 out of 4 of us had pasta so we asked for cheese and did not receive it neither. Then finally a manager walks by I'm guessing to touch base and explain to us why the pot stickers we ordered were still not there. He explained that the kitchen was short staff and they had to make the pot stickers from scratch which honestly should have been explained to us rather than having us thinking everything was under control. I'm beyond frustrated at this point and tell them to cancel that order of pot stickers. I then continue to explain to the manager (warren) that we weren't getting anything we ask for this whole night. No pina colada, no lemon, no cheese, no pot stickers and on top of all that horrible service. Little things could have made up for this bad experience but not one time did Kiy try to turn our experience around. When it was time for the bill the manager had to take off the pina colada that we never received and the pot stickers he also discounted a lot off our bill which we very much appreciated but the managers should not be held accountable every time a server can't seem to get it together. If he was communicating with us I'm pretty sure we would of understood a little more. After speaking to the manager for a while he learned it was my older cousins birthday and got her a cheese cake on the house which put a smile on her face. I end in saying every job is not for everyone and you can't make someone happy if you're not happy with what you're doing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=120

Kathy L.,"Bronxville, United States",0,9,,4.0,10/7/2016,"We have been to this location a few times. It is kid-friendly and there's a big variety food although the menu can be overwhelming. Overall, it is a good experience if you get there early before it starts to get crowded. My biggest complaint is the take-out counter which has compelled me to write a review.  Here is my breakdown.  Service - We have never had any issues with the wait staff. They are always pleasant and extremely attentive. Our waiter yesterday knew we liked the bread and made sure we had plenty. He came back at the right times after our appetizers, entrees and desserts came to see how we were doing. One complaint about the service is that my child's entrée came before the beverage came.  Food - Food is a hit or miss. There are plenty of eye-catching items on the menu but to read the whole menu takes awhile. I've had the burger before and those are always a hit. I had the fish taco last time and the tacos itself was good but the rice was bland and the beans had a taste to it as if it was many days old.  Dessert - No complaints but should always ask if one wants whipped cream or not. I am not a fan of whipped cream but my child is.  Take-out counter - We didn't want to carry the cheesecake around while we shopped so we came back later on. Not sure where the lack of communication is but there are two people behind the counters and waiters waiting for their dessert and coffee to bring to diners. I don't know why it took over 10 mins for two lattes and two pieces of cheesecake to go. One of them disappeared to get a jar of dressing that was clearly at the counter and the other was pre-occupied. There really isn't a reason to have people wait long enough that one of the maitre'd had to make our lattes herself.  Overall - I will come here again because of my love for cheesecake and the friendly wait staff.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=120

Elsa L.,"Yonkers, United States",135,28,24,4.0,1/5/2015,"I have come to this particular cheesecake factory only about 3 or 4 times. I haven't had to particularly wait too long but maybe its because i always go during the week. Only once did i need to wait about 30 minutes or so but we went to Sephora across the street and time went by fast.  The staff have always been friendly and attentive. I haven't had to constantly look for my server because they always come to check up on us.  I love love LOVE the Piña Colada from here. Don't like Piña coladas with alcohol so i always order the Virgin Piña coladas and they're amazing. Recommend to everyone! The food is also good but i wouldn't say its amazing. I'd Recommend the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and also the Pasta Da Vinci. Sometimes i find the food too greasy and then i look at the calories of each plate and see why its so high. I just wish it was a bit less greasy. I like how they give free refills with the soda though.  The place is really nice, dim and have outdoor seating good for the warm days ahead.  Lets not forget the reason why they're very famous....the CHEESECAKE. Love the cheesecake. Red Velvet Cheesecake is delicious but my favorite is the classic cheesecake.  I Haven't been disappointed at this place, and i would recommend. Not sure if they take reservations but it would be a good idea when going on the weekend because the wait is no joke.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=120

B F.,"Fair Lawn, United States",0,32,,1.0,7/9/2012,"Was here for brunch with family over the summer.  We were a large group - maybe a dozen or so.  Service was fine considering this.  Food?  Not so much - at least not my entree.  I'd give them a negative star for how they handled how they screwed up my meal if yelp would allow such a thing.   I ordered Eggs Benedict, one of my favorite choices for brunch.  I got a disgusting oily mess.  I explained to the waitress that it wasn't done properly.  She asked me if I was sure it wasn't the runny egg yolk.  Egg yolks are yellow - the oily mess was orange.  It wasn't the egg.  After bringing it back to the kitchen, she came back and told me they said it looked like the sauce broke.  If it wasn't done correctly, why are you serving it to me?!  I'm not an idiot.  I know what Eggs Benedict is supposed to be.  I probably should have ordered something else, but silly me, I wait optimistically, thinking they'll get it right this time.  So I sit and watch everyone else eat.  They're ordering dessert by the time I get my food back.  I had asked that they not bother putting the sauce on, but I see that there is quite a bit of ""sauce"" on it.  The sauce now looks solid - suspiciously, it's thicker than I've ever seen Hollandaise sauce to be.  My uncle said it looked like mayo.  Since I can't stand mayo, I wind up scraping it all off onto an empty plate.  It ends up occupying about half that plate.  I ate about a quarter of my meal and just couldn't stomach any more.  Just thinking about that experience is making me feel queasy right now.  So, needless to say, I will NOT be returning and hope to never have to see another Cheesecake Factory again!

She brought out bread and drinks with out introducing herself and only after we had been looking at the menus for a while did she let us know about the specials. She very rarely checked back with us and we had a sweet bus boy pack our food to go.

Our server, Chris was awesome- he was very cool and friendly. There was a lot of seating in and outdoors. All of the options on the low-cal menu are under 600 calories and everything we tried was pretty good! I had the pear & blue cheese flatbread appetizer (delicious!) and the soft shell tacos (shrimp). So I skipped the shells, they were falling apart and so thin they couldn't hold all of the insides in place and the spanish rice was a little bland, but other than that it was pretty satisfying.  I also tried one of the chicken samosas- I was not too crazy about them but they were okay. As hard as I tried, I couldn't make it out the darn door without the ultimate red velvet cheesecake. This stuff is like a drug but it's okay. It's only the SECOND HIGHEST CALORIC DESSERT ON THE MENU (beaten out by the PB cheesecake by 10 cals). whatever, I'll feed off of it for a week.

That includes two glasses of wine at $7.00 each and two slices of cheescake.  We wanted to take one slice of the cheesecake home because we were full. We asked for a take home carton but the server never came back after we payed the bill. After waiting awhile and not seeing our server anywhere, we had to leave to arrive on time for our other plans we had that day. So, we had to leave that half of cheesecake on the table. I was a bit annoyed by that. The two stars are for the price of the portion size of the meal compared to other restaurants I have visited.

Grace C.,"Yonkers, United States",0,4,,3.0,27/5/2012,"Okay, so maybe five hours ago I would've given this place a 4-star rating (Yay! I'm a fan) but after this evening, I'm sticking to a 3-star rating (A-OK) and I'm not giving this place a 1 because one of the waiters came to our rescue for the second time (thank you, Anthony!!!) and I've had good experiences at this Cheesecake Factory (with minor mishaps) before. The Cheesecake Factory should give Anthony a promotion because he is very attentive (to people like us who have been waiting for twenty-five minutes for our waitress to tend to us). He wasn't even in charge of our table and he was the only one who had the decency to tend to us. Bravo, Anthony!  Anyway, we waited forty minutes to be seated and granted it was Sunday afternoon, we were okay with that and we're use to it when it comes to this particular Cheesecake Factory. Okay, so we were seated and that is when my perception of this place spiraled downward!! (I use to love coming here). My husband and I were so mad because after being ignored for twenty minutes, we decided to speak to a manager. Was she any help? NO!! She assured my husband that she would take care of it but she didn't do anything about it, Anthony did!! She continued to avoid our table and even spoke to the people at the table next to us, who were having service issues with the waitress who was supposed to tend to us. The lady next to us told us, ""You didn't miss out on anything."" The manager didn't even look at us, no apology, NOTHING. I get it, it was busy, but after someone is seated, IT'S GAME TIME!  Moving on to the food. I always order the Americana Cheeseburger, no pickles (because with the pickles the burger turns out too salty), no onions (because when they do put grilled onions, they put waaaaay too many and that completely overpowers the other flavors), no tomatoes because I just prefer it that way and medium-well. Usually (not all the time) the burger turns out great, but tonight, I guess they just didn't have their game face on. It was a little bland. I ordered it with the sweet potato fries and they were too soft all around (they're supposed to be crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside). I guess they were sitting out for too long. The sweet potato fries here are hit or miss. Half of the time I have to send them back and get a new batch. Sometimes they are overcooked, sometimes cold.  I think this place has a lot of potential but management, I think, needs to get more involved and some of the staff need to be re-trained (except for Anthony). There is one manager who is very attentive though. He would've solved the problem right away, but this blonde short-haired woman, didn't care enough to make it up to us. Actually, since she told my husband she would take care of it during their conversation, my husband told Anthony to ask her, how was she going to take care of it. All she could do by the end of our meal was give us a free cheesecake and not charge us for my daughter's ice cream who was growing very impatient during our almost two hour wait. (I always tell her to remain calm though). Sorry lady, cheesecake is not going to solve your lack of hospitality sense. I decided to go with the red velvet which is good but too sweet. I love sweets but they have to be well-balanced. I have had the Godiva cheesecake, which I really recommend!! Not in this Cheesecake Factory though. Luckily, we got out right on time for our parking to be free (not a big deal but a good perk!). They validate but you're lucky if you get out on time. Just bring $3.25 just in case. We will not be returning. Sorry Cheesecake @ Ridgehill, we really did want to like you. We tried like six times and each time the service lacked more and more. Hope this helps fellow Yelpers!  *They do brunch on Sundays but I've never tried the food. I've also tried the Four Cheese Pasta and the Avocado Eggrolls and both are really tasty. Their vanilla milkshake is good and their whole wheat bread (before the meal) with the accompanying butter is really good.  *Their lemon-herb chicken is okay and their chicken bellagio is nothing to write home about. *I didn't like their orange chicken.

Everything that could possible go wrong did!  This place had me near tears for my birthday, ruined it. We were a table of 2, and were told our wait would be a half hour- 45 minutes, which is common on a Sat night. An hour and half passed and I ask a hostess if we were up soon and she said ""uh, yeah"". Fast forward a half hour later, and we still were not seated. I went up to another host and demanded to know why we were still waiting for 2 hours for a table for 2, he had no idea why our names were suddenly off the waiting list. Meaning that we could have waited until closing and would have never gotten a table! We were finally given a table and had to wait close to 10 min for a waiter to see us and give us water, and take our orders. We ordered drinks and got the wrong drinks, had to send them back. We ordered appetizers, and they never came. As we were waiting 20 minutes for the appetizers, the entrees came out! So our waitress said sorry and tried to take the entrees off our table and go get the appetizers. That makes NO sense because by now the appetizers would have been cold, and they would have left the entrees out as we ate the cold appetizers. We canceled the appetizers. Finally, we could enjoy some food, right? WRONG!!!! I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Pasta, and it was missing two main ingredients, at the point I was seriously upset. I sent the dish back, and when it came back, it came back cold and I could tell they just added the 2 missing things and tossed it around. The manager finally came out, and offered us a free dessert...at that point I just asked for it to go and left as fast as I could.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service.

Although I came here during a nasty snow storm, the place is beautiful and will definitely be a sight for sore eyes in warm weather.  The Cheesecake Factory itself is magnificent , very late very classy and it even has a full bar. It provides a certain atmosphere of peace and tranquility that makes U feel relaxed and welcome.  I didn't get to dive into the food a lot in terms of options but what I did have was incredible . Coming here hungry but wasn't crazing a meal I stuck to appetizers. I ordered buffalo wings and chicken sliders with fries . Simple, not too much and thinking I wasn't gonna be as full so I can have a cheesecake... Boy I was wrong . I had six pieces of wings and 1 small chicken slider, and I was beyond full . It was flavorful and the buffalo wings were tasty and spicy . For a place that specializes in cheesecake their wings are to die for . I did order a cheesecake and it was the dulce de leche with caramel cheesecake and it was an amazing choice. Really sweet and you can taste all the sweets given in. Overall the environment, location , taste and portions will leave you coming for more . The price overall was a bit high considering the little I ordered ( just over 60 for the apps and cheesecake, plus a drink) but it was definitely worth it because I was nothing short of satisfied .

Frank W.,"Yonkers, United States",42,10,3,1.0,27/12/2013,"I've uploaded a photo of their Lemon Herb Chicken served to us today as a To Go order.  Though management is always kind and good to refund us our dish and then some, the fact that I am now familiar with their placating protocols is not a good thing.  After multiple screw-ups and improperly cooked food, I don't see myself returning for anything but their pre made Cheesecakes that come frozen anyway. This Lemon Herb Roast Chicken dish is incredibly inconsistent.  It is great when it is good, but ... well you can see the picture.  We were basically served ashes.  In the restaurant we have been served this chicken very undercooked, to a point of seeing red juices coming out of it.   Get your kitchen in order Cheesecake Factory Ridge Hill.  I'm surprised someone hasn't shut you down yet for serving raw chicken.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=140

I'm a cheesecake factory veteran, I've been going for years (this one is still on the new side but I've been to many others) and I know what I like and how I like it.  I very rarely need to look at a menu.  The wait was said to be 30mins but it too a bit longer than that to be seated, that's the main reason I took a star off in this review.  Our waitress was Agatha and when I come here again, I'm definitely going to request sitting in her section.  She was very attentive and made recommendations (even though I really didn't need any).  My other complaint was that my side dish came out luke warm at best, but once I told Agatha about it, she got me a new dish very quickly so I'm not holding that against them. Overall my experience was very pleasant, I enjoyed the things that I ordered.  I was never without a refill on my lemonade (not getting refills in a timely fashion is one of my biggest pet peeves at restaurants) and my food was very good.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-yonkers?start=140

So I told her call me the manager he came and I showed him the pink peices and he said I'll have to ask my kitchen manager. He finally comes back and states that they accidentally switched the order. Mind you we don't eat pork!!! And he claimed that they will make the right one now I said no thank you. Instead of having dessert on the house they made us pay for it after saying they will take care of us. The only thing they took off was the app that they got wrong. Cheesecake was served to us still frozen. Literally this is the worst place ever. They tell you 30 mins to wait it's way longer of a wait then that.

Also, the shrimp scampi dish is amazing. The shrimp is top quality and the sauce is delicious. It comes with angel hair pasta, which is also great! Overall, definitely one of their top entrees. Everyone also enjoys their burgers because they have a great variety. However, if you love seafood and pasta - their shrimp scampi dish is excellent. Of course, the cheesecake is the best too. The banana creme one is my personal favorite.  The decor is very romantic and beautifully arranged. There is usually a wait to be seated at the Cheesecake factory. Especially after 7pm. However, it is definitely worth trying. They serve you bread with your dinner and offer great drinks to choose from. There is a bar area for those looking to come for drinks and a quick bite. They also offer a ""skinnylicious""menu for people that are on a diet.  It is a very broad menu. Some dishes are better than others.
