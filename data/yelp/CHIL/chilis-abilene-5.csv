Kendall T.,"Abilene, TX",6,21,7,2.0,12/22/2014,"This restaurant has gone downhill fast. Just recently, a few from the kitchen staff were let go because of a group photo where one actually mooned the camera in the kitchen. Our last visit was not a good experience either. It was tough to get a table (we were a party of 5+1 child). Our waitress was not available to take our order, so another waitress attempted to help us. It took several minutes to get our order placed. Then we only got partial portions of our meal.  Meals that had fries, were returned 3 times because they were cold. After eating part of our meal, because the rest did not show up till late, we had a visit from the manager. He advised he was new from another restaurant from South Texas, and asked if we wanted a free desert. That was the best he could do to make up for our poor experience. We hesitated to pay the ticket, but did with no gratuity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Fran W.,"Joshua, TX",0,3,,1.0,1/21/2017,"I got to the bar tables & did end up giving my order. The guacamole was too hot & the waitress just passed by without stopping to ask if I was ok, but continued walking as if she didn't have time for that. I shortly needed more water for this soon after. 2 men sat at a table next to me about 10 minutes after I did. They were so flirt serviced for tips I was ignored. I always leave a 20% tip, but when I went to pay In the table machine I was asked how the service was. It was terrible & I said so & for the first time I thought she didn't even need a terrible tip. So I wrote that on the payment machine. Well, something happened to the machine & she had to do the ticket herself & saw my remarks. It was obviously unappreciated by her & she let me know it by her upset look on her face when she gave me the ticket to sign. She doesn't deserve to be in this business. I usually tip 15% with bad service, but the more she kept going over to the table to service the men for tips, the more I thought a penny was even too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Linda W.,"Clyde, TX",1,54,9,4.0,2/20/2016,"Food is always great, even when busy; however, the restaurant is really too cramped. It was just my son and I dining and we were seated at a table for two,  but when the waiter delivered food to the table across from us, his butt was almost in my face! I love the restaurant, but don't like the close quarters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Elise W.,"San Antonio, TX",105,82,8,1.0,12/16/2014,Ugh why eat plain average food when Abilene is FULL of local restaurants?! Also- I will never understand why they put those awful tablets on the table. Dining out is suppose to be about one on one time with actual people!

Debbie B.,"Abilene, TX",14,13,2,1.0,8/7/2015,"I had not been  here in months because it had gotten so bad. The place is dirty, the service is awful, and the food horrible.  Decided to try it again since this town is limited on restaurants. Didn't think it could be worse then a few months ago. I was wrong. Took over a hour to get our food. Took over 15 min to even have our drink order taken. Dirty glasses, dirty silverware, from the table we could watch the cooks outside smoking, which is really gross. This place needs a complete change it needs to be closed and cleaned, new staff, new management, new attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Larry W.,"Tucumcari, NM",27,7,,4.0,12/19/2015,"Stopped in while traveling through. The wait staff was friendly and pretty attentive considering there was a large table she was also taking care of. Overall the restaurant needed a little cleaning there were dirty tables (floor included) near by which was likely a result of the server being busy. When our order was delivered I mentioned that the tea tasted funny and requested a water instead, the tea remained on my bill and we needed to get going so I didn't have a chance to ask them to remove it. I think if I had asked my server rather than another server it would have been removed, she likely didn't communicate the change to my server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Gayle J.,"Garland, TX",11,21,2,1.0,5/12/2016,"Horrible service. Miguel was distracted by his phone. I had to refill my own water, no one notice. I had to get my own Togo container. No one noticed. The managers came by everyone's table, but ours. Miguel went out the back door to be on his phone. Was quick to get us the check...mid meal. Horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Carrie B.,"Abilene, TX",18,53,12,2.0,7/1/2015,This Chilis has gotten worse over the years. Honestly if you want Chilis in Abilene go to the north side one off I20 and HWY 351. Much better service. This one you can expect to wait an hour for your food. This visit we waited at the hostess station for 5 minutes with no hostess in dire. Finally the bartender came over and sat us. Our food then took an hour to get to the table. Last time we came here we had placed a to go order and when we came to pick up they were out of salad. How does that happen?  They were nice and sent our order to the other Chilis though. Anyways the other Chilis even if out of your way is way worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Sterling R.,"Abilene, TX",17,16,1,2.0,11/1/2015,"It's chili's. Mediocre food and lack luster service serving. Microwaved food, $30 for 2 people. They also stopped emailing coupons and instead have some stupid points system which doesn't make me want to come in more. They had more business from me when they sent the coupons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Bri G.,"Abilene, TX",60,6,,1.0,8/19/2015,"We never even got seated. We stood for ten minutes and no one even talked to us, there wasn't a line or anything and the waitresses would look up at us then walk off. Really disappointed and annoyed with the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Tyler P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",9,39,3,2.0,9/2/2014,The service at the bar is horrible. I do like the draft selection. And the food is what you would expect from a Chili's.

Hunter V.,"Dallas, TX",101,18,,5.0,7/8/2014,I love chili's I'd eat there everyday if I could. Yum yum yum yum yum. This is a good location off the highway and close to a bunch of hotels.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Shelly S.,"Eastland, TX",22,14,,1.0,9/15/2015,"We waited for awhile before a waitress finally came and seated us, after the bartender yelled towards the kitchen for someone to come up. She seated us at a dirty table that was too little to fit two plates on. Another waitress was getting ready for a party next to us by dragging the tables and chairs across the floor, one by one. I don't think she could have made any more noise if she tried. The food is mediocre here, at best. We remembered why we don't come here and left before it got any worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20

KaLeigh H.,"Abilene, TX",339,47,45,5.0,3/18/2014,UHHH YUM. This chili's service is kinda hit and miss but the food is consistent because I'm sure it comes from a bag but what the hay? You're not at chilis to eat healthy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Bradley B.,"Abilene, TX",5,61,17,2.0,1/9/2014,"Every time I eat here, I remember why I avoid this hole. Dirty, slow, and mediocre food. The north side Chili's is so much better.  Our waitress was nice, but that was it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Lisa E.,"Abilene, TX",36,47,,2.0,8/18/2013,the drinks are awful..the hostess are even worse. the foods okay. Any other chilis I got to I get margaritas..this chilis I don't even bother it taste like I am drinking just the mix.   this chilis is a disgrace. I also went there when they were having kidds kids..where a certain percent of your bill went to kidds kids..and our waiter had no idea what I was talking about and he never said anything about it again. bad staff. worse bartenders..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20
Anne K.,"Austin, TX",21,19,,4.0,12/27/2012,"We were on the road between Santa Fe and Austin and looking for a quick turn around. Chili's definitely fit the requirements.

Jennifer R.,"Copperas Cove, TX",0,6,,1.0,4/25/2014,"Our family has given this place 3 chances and only once have I actually liked my food (a salad). Just tried the fajitas and I am pretty disgusted. I am almost certain the chicken portion was boiled because it had that chunky texture and no cook marks whatsoever. The steak portion came out bleeding. It was rare and mushy. I didn't request it that way but I've never been served bleeding fajitas at any other establishment that served fajitas. Tried to pick a lower cost margarita for a Friday evening, no prices on the drink menu so I go for a little mini margarita sampler which would equal one standard size... Turns out that was $9!!!! My husbands fries where blatantly heat lamped and had no flavor. When the server asked how the food was as she could see we were done, my hubby told her the fajitas weren't great (obvious by how little I ate of them), couldn't care less and brought our check. That's $55 we will never get back again. I am so done with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=40
Jessica H.,"Philadelphia, PA",21,197,18,3.0,8/16/2009,"What this particular Chili's excels at is customer service. After having some good experiences at the restaurant on the north end of town we went to this particular location twice (as it is much closer to our house). The first experience was ok - brand spanking new waitress (who was too nice for her own good) and a good, cheap meal. They didn't have avocado slices like other locations, only prepared guac, but whatever. Our most recent eating experience here left a lot to be desired, however. They were PACKED - I guess this is the place to be in Abilene on a Friday night. Our food took a while to get out and some of our requests (no jalapenos) were ignored - I'm not sure who dropped the ball here, the kitchen or our waiter. They were out of Corona Light and the margarita that I ordered came out so thick that it was more like a snow cone and I don't think there was any tequila in there. Our meals were ok. The chicken on my salad was meager - much less than any of my previous visits and they were out of normal ranch dressing, only having jalapeno ranch. Our waiter forgot to give us any silverware and appetizer plates until we asked for them - and then we only got forks. For dessert they were out of both the chocolate and chocolate chip moltens (which we came to find out the north end was also out of) so we got the cheesecake. Now for the capstone to the night - it was still frozen when it came out! By this point we were complaining to the manager who quite surprisingly took care of our bill - we were really just informing her and hoping for maybe 10% off or something. I will give them another chance most likely (they're having a great promotion right now) but chances are it won't be on a Friday night with the rest of the town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=40
Shannon T.,"Abilene, TX",5,26,5,4.0,11/3/2017,"We enjoyed a lunch at Chili's. We ordered a reg old timers hamburger, crispy chicken and  potato soup.  Everything was good. The staff was pleasant and it was a good experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5
Kim S.,"Eastland, TX",14,11,5,1.0,12/20/2017,"This place is ridiculous! Waited for over 30 minutes for drinks, because the bartender wasn't assertive enough to get the manager to unlock the cabinet. Hamburger came out with wilted lettuce and hot mayo because it had been sitting under the warmer for so long. All the MOD could do is make excuses! Unless you have an hour and a half to kill for lunch, avoid this joint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5
Garry H.,"Abilene, TX",202,800,1310,4.0,9/7/2017,"Glenda loves Chili's, I can take it or leave it. The menu is big so you can always find something worth eating. Several of their specials are a pretty good deal. We usually end up in the bar because we don't want to wait on a table. Yes, that's the crowded, loud, noisy bar. Usually get a burger cause that's hard to screw up, but the specials we have tried have been really good. BUT, forget the table kiosks. I want to talk to you. I want to be waited on. I want to tip you for the great service you are going to give me! Is that asking to much? Am I right Brenda? See you next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5
Jeff G.,"Abilene, TX",2,75,,2.0,11/27/2017,Likely my last time to eat there.  Not overly bad but just not good - there are much better places to eat for the money.   Sad compared to what it used to be.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5
James E.,"Abilene, TX",54,89,21,4.0,9/5/2017,"Chili's is a favorite of mine . The honey chipotle chicken strips are way good. It's so easy to order on the app and pick it up. If your looking for some good American food, Chili's is a good. I love the old timer as well. You can get on the waiting list from the app.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5
Baron Branndi C.,"Blackwell, TX",11,5,,2.0,9/18/2017,"With Chili's being a franchise and our experience with the service we received today reinforces why we will go to non franchise restaurants.  Chili's, like most, don't particularly care about one or two customers because of the business they bring.  Over 13 minutes and no drinks, we canceled and continued to dine. When we received our bill it showed a comp for drinks. One normally takes them off the bill but to comp shows no fault on Chili's behalf.  It is my opinion this is becoming the norm for franchise restaurants. Will not visit the Chili's in Abilene ever again when there are restaurants that provide better service and place the customer first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5
Jonette J.,"Midland, TX",1,11,,1.0,9/17/2017,"Really pissed off, right now.  I use to order the Spinach dip.  They took it off menu.  I use to order the onions and jalapenos appetizer,  taken off.  I found a drink I like, Blood Orange Punch, taken off menu.  Crispy Asparagus,  gone.  Just leave the Honey Chipotle Crispers ALONE!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5
Sandra G.,"Abilene, TX",0,4,,2.0,11/4/2017,The fajitas were good and our waiter KeShawn was great however our First drinks were terrible. I ordered the Fresca Margarita and my husband ordered the strawberry Patron margarita and both had so much sweet & sour mix in them that is all we could taste. It was like drinking liquid sweet tart. We let our waiter know then my husband got a glass of wine and I ordered an extra spicy Bloody Mary. Of course his wine was great but my bloody Mary tasted like water downed tomato juice. Not spicy at all. I had a Bloody Mary there earlier that day with my friend and it was fantastic! Super spicy and strong. Disappointed to say the least for my dinner date with my hubby. We sat in the bar area and it was super loud also between the football games and a fan yelling at every touchdown and his little kids yelling and scraping thier chairs loudly on the tile. Probably will visit for  a quick lunch but other places are nicer for dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5
Anthony M.,"Austin, TX",418,247,333,3.0,11/25/2016,The food is a 4/5. The service is 2/5. Been here many times and can always expect this to be the case.

Barbara T.,"Abilene, TX",47,67,71,4.0,4/14/2016,"Wednesday night, I downloaded the app to get call ahead seating.  Easy.  We were seated within minutes of entering.  Our friendly  waitress showed up soon thereafter to get our drink order. We all get Dr Pepper,  as their tea isn't much to brag on.  My son ordered the chili dip in a skillet  n chips.  She quickly returned with correct drinks and said appetizer.  Son ordered the chicken quesadillas,  husband orders ribs, fries, and is convinced to up size the little mini molten for the full size for $2 difference.  I ordered the mango talapia, sub corn on cob for rice.  By the time the appetizer is devoured, our food arrives hot. The quesadilla has chicken that appears to be shredded,  not fajita style, with scant cheese.  The ribs are not very meaty. But mama is very happy with the VERY SPICY glaze on the cooked right fish topped with a mango jalapeno relish, bright green broccoli,  and tender, juicy corn on the cob. The green salad I snagged from my nonveggie eating son was topped with a small amount of cheese, dressing,  and croutons.  We got the dessert to go, which turned out to be a large, tender, chocolate bundt cake with a gooey chocolate center, a side of vanilla ice cream,  with caramel,  and melted chocolate crackle topping.  Our waitress was great and the food satisfied .  The only complaint was the crying toddler at the next table, who occasional screams tore at our nerves. Been there, done that, so to a point, I can tolerate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5
Stephanie U.,"New York, NY",177,99,86,3.0,9/25/2015,Both me and the friend I was eating with had dirty silverware and the seats in the booths were also dirty.

Jennifer M.,"Abilene, TX",0,14,6,3.0,7/17/2016,"Well, I am usually a big fan of Chili's but this One, not so much. Let's see... Hostess hardly friendly at all and didn't even ask about a children's menu. The floor was quite gross but someone was going around trying to get everything up. Nobody even asked us for drinks for about 10-15 min. Then that took a while to get. Appetizer came pretty quick but the guacamole was flavorless and the salad was nothing more than juice in a bowl. Half and hour later, still no food. Sigh. Not even our soups came until she realized she forgot them as she delivered our meals... After 35 min. Waitress was friendly enough but overall, I think they are having a bad day. We are now all done and I will say that...

Brenda C.,"Abilene, TX",5,56,98,4.0,8/21/2016,"We were there late and only for dessert and coffee. The service was a bit slow but the waiter explained the reason, which certainly always helps. He was very attentive. The giant cast iron cookie with ice-cream was to die for. The coffee was good, but not great. I consistently get good food and service at Chili's.
