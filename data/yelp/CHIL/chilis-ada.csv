Megan P.,"Ada, OK",22,10,,5.0,8/16/2017,Love our local Chili's! I haven't always been a big fan of Chili's but I love ours! The wait staff is always amazing and go above and beyond!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ada
Phuong N.,"Charlotte, NC",64,17,72,5.0,5/13/2015,"I went to Chili's several times, waitresses were very friendly and helpful. Once I had a bit late lunch, it was happy time or something I had discount 50% of bill. It was surprised me, it kinda small gift for my day. But once I went to order to go, I didn't know where I should have picked up stuff, so we waited in front of bar so long and didn't know our order was ready. But everything else is perfect. We love coronarita and season patron margarita!!!!! And wings are delicious. And grill pork and shrimp are my favorite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ada
Cindy D.,"Tulsa, OK",197,139,591,3.0,7/9/2014,"I like Chili's for one thing - their Chicken Caribbean Salad. This is what I go for. The salad contains grilled chicken, mandarin oranges, pineapple, cilantro, diced red peppers,dried cranberries, tortilla chips, and green onions on a bed of lettuce. The honey-lime dressing is awesome.  Most of the other food at Chili's is not much to my liking. It's a bit heavy on the grease and salt. The rolls are way too big (for me) and too many calories for what you get!  But if you are looking for a good salad, try the Chicken Caribbean.  I also recommend the Santa Fe Chicken salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ada
Mike D.,"Tulsa, OK",0,3,,5.0,8/24/2016,"Wait staff was very attentive.  The food was good,  better than other Chili's I have eaten at.  Would certainly come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ada
Kelsea R.,"Ada, OK",86,14,1,2.0,12/28/2015,"This particular Chili's tends to have a problem with ordering enough food to serve. They are usually out of important things. The service is a hit and a miss. Sometimes you get a fantastic waiter that makes the visit worth it. But then you could get someone who obviously hates their job. Twice I've seen the manager yelling at staff in front of the restaurant. There were only a few tables sat, but I still didn't want to feel awkward while he yelled at the servers. The food has usually been good. There's a disconnect between what you tell the waiter and what is cooked, so be careful if you have food allergies. It's an average Chili's. Great because it's open late, but it can be a gamble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ada
Lauren W.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,8,,1.0,1/6/2015,"Service is WAY to slow!!! Food was disgusting. I had a burger and they overcooked it... A  burger is not hard to make people! And I only ordered a burger because they ran out of pasta! I sent back a lemonade, queso, almost everything... After waiting 40 minutes worst service ever . Don't eat here ... I won't",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ada
Danny R.,"Ada, OK",6,5,1,3.0,8/25/2010,Typical American fair. Can be good in the sense you can probably find something everyone can eat but nothing really jumps out at you. Service is just okay. Restaurant is clean and plays good music.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ada
Shane M.,"Ada, OK",2,3,,2.0,12/18/2010,Floors were dirty. Service was slow. Staff seemed inexperience and not happy to be there.  Would not recommend chili's in Ada.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ada
