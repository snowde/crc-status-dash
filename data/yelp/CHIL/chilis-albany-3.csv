Food C.,"Charlotte, NC",2,33,24,4.0,11/11/2017,Visited Chilli's on Veterans day and received a free meal Cajun chicken pasta. It was an unexpected surprise. My wife ordered the same meal. Just the right amount of spicey. It was very good. Great service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Dani C.,"Richmond Hill, NY",0,16,14,2.0,10/2/2017,Normally a big fan of Chilis.  However this one needs some work.  Everything is mediocre from service to food. Some of the staff seemed half asleep and confused by questions.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Angelo A.,"Albany, NY",0,7,,5.0,6/25/2017,I really appreciate the manager for cancelling my pickup order. I made a mistake & he was very polite. Thanks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Peter V.,"Albany, GA",29,19,4,4.0,3/13/2017,Went 1X again.  Device had improved. Food was hot and the waiter was very helpful.  I had the chicken fingers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Toni A.,"Leesburg, GA",10,30,49,4.0,4/6/2017,I've never had a bad experience at this location. The food has always been good and it's very rare that we have poor service. This place is one if the better restaurants in the Albany area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Danielle A.,"GA, GA",10,15,,1.0,5/13/2017,"While we had good service (for it being busy) & the food tasting good, I'm giving it only 1 star because my husband I both have upset stomachs after eating there. The margaritas were also very weak. I thought I was drinking straight mix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Rory S.,"Tomah, WI",39,27,3,4.0,11/26/2016,"I had lunch here with my mother after visiting Walmart.  Did not look at the other reviews or rating prior to being seated. I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos and my mother had the quesadilla explosion salad.  Both meals were hot, fresh and delicious.  And service was prompt, the server was too attentive.  A little attention to detail would have been awesome.  Don't ask me if I would like more sofa just after I took a bite of food. He was at our table every three minutes checking on our dining situation.  The server was not helping out his tip.  I would eat here again, but try to avoid his section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Leadpersuasion ..,"Albany, GA",1,10,,1.0,1/15/2017,"Called in a pickup order recently. Ordered the bacon cheeseburger and fries with ranch on the side. I got home only to find a plain cheeseburger and no ranch. Called and talked to the manager who said all she could do was mail me some coupons...wtf?! How about offering to cut my bill some since the order was wrong? Why do they assume I will be coming back to use their coupons?! Anyway, I won't be giving them anymore business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Greg E.,"Marietta, GA",134,483,65,3.0,9/8/2015,"I've never been the biggest fan of Chili's. While the food isn't bad, it's not that spectacular neither. This restaurant is somewhere in the middle. The few times that I have ate here my meals have been good. Not great, but good. However, the desserts are delicious though. I think Chili's have some of the best deserts out of all of the chain dine-in restaurants. Of course Chili's have a full size bar which is part of the restaurant's appeal. I'm not a heavy drinker so I'm not sure of the prices and whether or not if the drinks are watered down.  Since this is out of the way it is unlikely that I will be here on a regular basis, but this restaurant isn't as bad as many of the other reviewers are making it out to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Courtney C.,"Atlanta, GA",5,41,6,1.0,4/2/2016,"This was the most disgusting meal I have ever had. Soup was cold, salad was old, steak and potatoes were both cold and seemed like they had been in the kitchen for a while. The server didn't have offer any kind of solution for the terrible food. Bottom line: avoid this Chili's!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Aaron H.,"Albany, GA",40,188,1003,3.0,1/23/2015,"The reviews on this place piqued my curiosity for some reason. That reason was 5 reviews and all of them were 1 star! Fortunately, I have eaten here a few times and I've never honestly had a bad experience. I've tried their fried jalapeño ""chips"" and they were really good the time I've had them. I've had burgers here before and it was really good. The only real issue I have ever had here was the pricing. I've never felt it was a great deal for what you are getting, but that's not a huge issue.  Let's get to the visit today, though. (Seriously, FIVE one-star reviews! Really?) The waitress, Katrell, was really a decent server. She was around consistently and generally pleasant, but not pushy. She wasn't amazing, but she was above-average. Nice work!  We started out with drinks and we both ordered water this time. I sent my water back because it really, really tasted bad to me. It had more of a tap water taste than I wanted. I replaced that with an Arnold Palmer tea & lemonade mix and that was okay. I ordered a full order of Texas Cheese Fries while we decided on what we wanted.  The cheese fries were great! They had the right level of crispiness, cheese, green onion, jalapeños and bacon. It came with two small cups of ranch for dipping. It might have had more jalapeños than most people are accustomed to, actually, but it was just all around the best item we ate.  We eventually (I say that because we probably took 5 minutes to order this time) decided we wanted to get the 2 for $20 deal which offered a few appetizers and two entrees for 20 dollars (not including any drinks or any extras). I chose the onion rings for our next appetizer. It was probably not the best choice. The batter they used was heavy and seemed like the same thing used for a fish fry. The sauce was also ranch and I really do not feel it paired well with the heavy breading of the onions. It needed a creamy horseradish sauce of some kind or possibly something like you get with the Bloomin' Onion at Outback. It wasn't bad, but we didn't finish the onion rings.  My wife loves to get sirloins at almost any place that has something like that and she stuck to her usual deal. She ordered the 6 oz sirloin (medium rare), steamed broccoli, and the jalapeño cornbread ($1 more). The presentation was awful. It was not arranged well, there were juices everywhere, and the broccoli just looked like it was thrown on the plate. The picture I took of the plate made it look much better than it really was. The sirloin seemed like it was cooked to the desired temperature and I took a picture to show that it was medium rare. It had plenty of pink. My wife complained that it was very rough and it did seem a little rough when I tried it, but I am not sure it was bad. Unfortunately, she didn't eat any more of it and was unwilling to complain about it. She thinks it was just the cut of meat. She also did not like the jalapeño cornbread she ordered and described it as ""jalapeño cake."" I have to agree with her there. It was very soggy and not full of flavor and topped with crusty cheese.  I chose the 1/2 rack of baby back ribs. I have never tried them at Chili's. They are known for their baby back ribs, too. I mean, they have their own song! It's in their commercials every time I have ever watched a Chili's commercial. I love ribs and it was time. Eh, but it wasn't impressive. I won't go so far as to say it was a disappointment, but it wasn't great. They situated the ribs on top of the fries and the plating really failed again. It was a hunk of meat with potato arms underneath and completely unappealing. The ribs themselves looked a bit dry and the entree came with no sauce. I asked Katrell for some sauce and she came back with a little cup of BBQ sauce. The sauce reminded me of Kraft BBQ sauce and just did nothing for the ribs. The little cup was also not conducive to dipping ribs. It was the same cup used for other condiments and was very small. If you can imagine the little cups used for ketchup at many fast-food restaurants you wouldn't be far off. I am used to having a bottle of sauce to pour or squirt onto ribs. Apparently, I needed to dip my ribs into them like fries. Someone didn't think this through. I also felt I needed a knife to separate my ribs, because they weren't just falling apart. I'm sorry Chili's, but I don't need my baby back ribs and I won't be singing a tune for you. I should have gone with a hamburger.  The experience as a whole was pretty average and I would return. The health score was a 100 and that encouraged me to continue through the door. The waitress was above par and the food was generally good or edible, but pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Milisa B.,"Albany, GA",29,5,2,1.0,12/18/2014,"Tremendously disappointing.  Ordered online for Curbside to Go.  I ordered a BOWL of chili.  What I got was a little, tiny paper container.  I paid $5.29 for this Chili.  Had I known what I was going to get, I would have gone down the street to Wendy's and had better chili and saved $4.00.  I have given this Chilis a single star because after my third visit, I have yet to have a pleasant experience and I don't see a negative star option here.  Chilis, if you read these reviews...Invest in some Customer Service training for your lobby staff, time management training for your kitchen staff as a good faith effort to have food ready by the time it's promised and modify your menu to specify the difference between a CUP of chili and a BOWL of chili because as far as I can tell, these sizes are one in the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Anna B.,"Albany, GA",61,2,,1.0,2/19/2016,Never ever ever again!! Don't waste your time or money! Soggy food! Rude staff! And not so much as an apology! I wouldn't eat here again if the food was free!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Scorpio S.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,119,270,5.0,12/19/2015,"I had both the honor and pleasure of treating my Fiancée to a late afternoon meal here, with the ""un-limited"" soup and salad, and she agreed with me that the service and the food were both terrific, thanks of course to John Price, the Assistant Manager, who goes out of his way to satisfy his customers, ensuring that they will keep coming back for more, frequently.  Most definitely, my Southern Belle will be there as my guest, OFTEN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
BooBoo B.,"Sasser, GA",3,3,,1.0,2/21/2016,I will not be back.  To sum up my experience when I was leaving I had to step over vomit in the floor at another table.  I didn't even eat food was burnt 1st time and still not right the 2nd time.  Manager did offer to make my meal right,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Gabrielle S.,"Albany, GA",0,13,2,2.0,9/30/2015,"I only go to chilis because I work so close to it. I usually have ok service but its never great and outstanding like customer service should be. The last time I went there for lunch with a coworker, our server was horribly trained. When she approached our table she didn't speak she just stared at me and waited for me to talk. I was honestly unsure if she was even who I ordered my food from. She didn't bring any silverware the whole time we ate without silverware. I burned myself on hot plates due to the lack of a fork, we had endless chips and salsa and we asked for more chips but didn't get them until we were done eating. Keep in mind that we were on an hour lunch break so we had to hurry and eat our food to get back to work. Chili's needs to get there staff together and their restaurant needs a little work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Sunny C.,"Sale City, GA",0,5,,1.0,5/8/2015,This is my 6th or 7th visit here and rarely have I come and everything come out right. They just can't seem to get it right. The manager is a nice guy and I can tell he is trying but...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
John V.,"Malta, IL",0,71,5,1.0,12/12/2013,Ate here with a group of my coworkers for lunch.  The food was mediocre at best and the service terribly slow.  It took about an hour and a half to get our food.  Avoid this place!  I will never return to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Brad B.,"Winter Garden, FL",0,31,4,1.0,12/9/2010,"I had terrible service from the woman at the bar. The greeter was very nice, but the bartender was awful.. I wish I caught her name,but she didn't stick around long enough when she did come by. You expect bartenders to have the best social skills of all employees. It took an hour to get something to go. Will not be back for a very long time, any management that would keep a bartender around with this bad of an attitude has to be awful.  food was meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
Patsy R.,"Albany, GA",2,3,,1.0,1/18/2013,"So, we go to chili's for dinner. We have to wait 10-15 min. Ok, so we sit down. We observe 4 tables exit. We wait....and wait....and wait. Another party next to us went up to inquire, he was told they had to wait for the manager to give them permission to seat more customers because the kitchen would get behind. OMG are you freaking kidding me? Another party came in & asked if they could sit in bar area, they went straight in!!! We were never given that option. We got up & told her it was unacceptable & to take us off the list. The last time we went there the waitress couldn't get the order right. Needless to say, we won't be back. Poor management & poor employees",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-albany-3
