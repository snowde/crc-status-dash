Ali A.,"Anchorage, AK",0,4,,4.0,12/29/2017,Good service- not a long wait. Delicious food- just extremely large portions. Waiter was very friendly and always on top of everything.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6
Tamara D.,"Anchorage, AK",10,148,163,3.0,2/5/2017,Arrived at dinner time on a Friday night and was seated right away.  Our server was friendly and quick to refill our drinks.  Usually I order the same thing at the same places every time I go out to eat but I wanted to try something new this time which ended up being a mistake.  I ordered the chicken burrito which looked great.... and the plate was too hot to touch.... but the burrito was cold.  Like it just came out of the fridge.  The cheese was still cold and shredded like I'd just bought it from the store.  Was super disappointed but my husband and sons meals turned out great.  So I just ate chips and salsa and had the server take back my order (I would've ordered something else but my husband and son were almost done with their food already).   So still 3 stars for my husbands and sons meals and the friendly server.  We'd come back sometime but I'll just stick with my regular order choices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6
Stefan E.,"Anchorage, AK",24,46,115,3.0,3/30/2017,"At least... there's beer in the mall...?  As a standard Chili's, there's not much reason to go out of your way for this one but if you're at the mall anyway or want some quick eats, you could do worse (downstairs in the food court, actually.) I have had drinks here a few times and they have a solid bartender (though I don't typically get any fussier than a rye whiskey on the rocks). I don't know her name but she's treated us well every time. Casually conversational but not OVERLY-so. Just enough friendliness is all I need from a bartender and she is great. The food has never been much to write home about (especially in the shadow of next door's Olive Garden) but it'll do. The biggest perk to having this place at the Dimond Center is probably the quick, accessible bar. Who doesn't appreciate THAT, especially during the holiday shopping season?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6
Edward W.,"Palmer, AK",0,2,,1.0,11/24/2017,"Terrible. If Mercedes is your server, do yourself and go to Olive Garden. Takes forever to bring out refills, when she finally does it's wrong.

J M.,"Summerton, SC",0,12,,1.0,9/2/2017,"I would give zero stars if I could. Service was very slow and place wasn't packed. Ordered chicken and steak fajitas and only got 3 tortillas. I asked for more and never got them. I ended up eating the rest of the fajitas without the tortillas. My wife got the honey chipotle chicken and waffles. The chicken was good, but the waffles were hard and burnt on the bottom. This Chili's is now on my ""ban list"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6

Regina F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,18,,1.0,11/2/2017,"My husband and I used to enjoy Chili's for an easy and relaxed eating option, however; the past few visits have been less than appetizing. This Chili's in particular was quite disappointing. We waited to be acknowledged, seated, and served for an unreasonable amount of time. Once we ordered, our food came before the appetizer and was incomplete. This was made slightly worst due to the waiter attempting to be playful in conversation when we addressed our issues, as well as not taking any responsibility or action besides passing the blame on the kitchen staff, boo to that. Overall, this was a bad enough dining experience mixed with a $50 bill for two, to persuade us to not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6
Merijeanne H.,"Anchorage, AK",21,7,,1.0,10/4/2017,"Horrible, abysmal service.  We went there for lunch, and ordered bottomless soup and salad, and soft drinks.   After over an hour, we not only had never seen the server again, we found the service bar and refilled our own water glasses.  When we went on a hunt for a manager and requested our Bill, we were told to pay by kiosk.  The kiosk didn't work, and spewed paper all over the table.  AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6

Melissa M.,"Anchorage, AK",7,1,,1.0,10/14/2016,"What has happened to Chilis??? Hostess was very confused in seating people on which should have been our first clue. About 15 minutes before we had our server come to our table the first time. By then we all knew what we wanted to order. I had the chicken crispers original style - not so crisp, kind of bland AND I had to ask for the honey mustard it was supposed to come with. My husband had the triple dipper (cheddar bites, sliders and southwestern egg roll) - sliders were still a bit raw in the middle, egg rolls were rubbery, cheddar bites were fine. My daughter had the oldtimer burger - driest burger I have ever tasted. The onion on it was juicier. And the drinks - when you can taste the algae taste in a Coke - time to really clean.  We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6
Mercedes S.,"Anchorage, AK",15,2,,1.0,1/25/2017,The server was nice and the food came out fast  but the food was awful. I orderd the chicken strips they have and they looked and tasted like pork skins the fries were awful and tasteless and my corn on the cob was more like mush on a stick it was bad my husband was also not happy with his meal and the lava cake was also not very good.  The only good thing they had going for them was the super nice server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6
Chris B.,"Anchorage, AK",61,9,3,1.0,8/5/2016,"We stopped into this location tonight for dinner and drinks. Our Server seemed like he didn't want to be there and it showed by his lack of interest and attentiveness to our table. Food was okay. My girlfriend ordered a Patron Margarita and the container it was served in leaked everywhere. They gave her a small glass filled to the top and she had to sip the drink and then finally received a straw from another waitress. The food was okay but when we were finished with plenty of food still left, our server took the food and dumped it with no ask to whether we wanted to box it up.  It's hard to think we would want to waste all of that food.  This will be the last time we eat there.  Don't waste your time or money on this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6

Larry S.,"Anchorage, AK",38,3,,1.0,10/14/2016,This was a very bad experience. The food was not good and poorly cooked. The staff was very slow and while nice to your face they were not very attentive. We had to ask for things several times. I think the only reason they are still in business is because they are connected to the mall. Regardless I will not be coming back.

Clarissa W.,"Lubbock, TX",0,1,,1.0,6/16/2016,"My daughter and I went to meet up with some friends last night which is the only reason why we went because I was not impressed with the reviews and now, I can see why.  I had the steak and while the steak and broccoli was satisfactory, the mashed potatoes looked and tasted like glue with cheese on top. Just awful. I also thought the drink prices were a bit pricey. Last but not least, we asked for separate checks and when we got the bills, he had mixed up the meals, putting some of my friends meals on mine etc...he came back with revised bills and still had charged me for a game.

Laura H.,"Anchorage, AK",26,38,,1.0,9/13/2015,"What. Happened. To. Chilis.  I mean it was never a great experience in the past, but the food was at least decent. Now, its akin to applebees on a bad day.  My mom & I went in recently, our waitress was so pregnant she was REALLY inconvenienced to have to walk to our table a few times.   My food was cold and the lettuce, that I had ordered to not be on it, was wilted and slimy. My mothers food was dry and halfway through we discovered that both of our plates were filthy.  Tried sending the food back but it was far too complicated and we had, had enough stress that day. I dont recommend. Its disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6
Kevin S.,"Lahaina, HI",0,20,6,1.0,12/6/2014,"Horrible. Absolutely Horrible. Can you believe I had to send back a platinum Margarita!?  They said the sour mix was bad and made another for me which was just slightly better but barely drinkable. I'm thinking not a good start but let's keep rolling.  So the food....fresh guacamole is a joke....huge platter of chips and a small paltry cup of guacamole and not so good salsa.  I ordered the beef enchiladas. See picture. I can't comment on the taste as I would not eat them. They looked as if they were thrown onto the plate and the entire plate was splattered with enchilada sauce. When I looked closely there was a clear watery liquid under all the food. Just looking at it ruined my appetite.  At this point I just asked for the bill, they did remove the enchiladas. Our waitress was nice although somewhat embarrassed by everything.   I Mean this is a brand new restaurant and I felt like it was ready for one of those "" Secret Diner"" cable TV shows  I wish I had read the other reviews before coming here.

Wesley R.,"Anchorage, AK",0,11,,3.0,3/3/2016,The food is fairly good not great heavily over spiced. The enchiladas are more like big toquitos hard on the outside should be soft.

Stephanie J.,"Anchorage, AK",0,1,,2.0,9/2/2014,"My office has ordered togo from Chili's a couple of times and each time there are issues with the order.  This is the first time I've actually written a review.    I didn't think to open each container in the togo bag, but I should have.   The waitress giving me my order assured me it was all there.    Low and behold one complete meal was missing and half of another meal.  When I called back to tell them the person that answered pretty much told me that I was lying.  The manager got on the phone and said he would make it right.   Now the inconvenience of going back to pick up the two things missing still lingers.     Also, when you get soup, they are inconsistent in how they serve it to go.  This time they actually put the soup toppings in a separate container, but other times they added them to the soup and they were soggy by the time we ate,    Also when getting the chips and salsa to go the amount give is inconsistent.  This time around we received half the amount of chips we did the other times.   The food that was ordered and received was good, but the service was very bad.  I also had to wait an extra 20 minutes for the togo order.  And when I called in they said it would be 15 minutes.  It took well over 30 minutes from the time I ordered to get what I thought was my full order.   Disappointed to say the least...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6?start=20

The only reason I give them 2 instead of 1 is because their food tastes good! This guy didn't try to help us or give suggestions and acted like he didn't even want to be there. To top it off we ordered enchiladas and had leftovers we wanted to take home. He asked my boyfriend if he could take our plates but didn't ask if we wanted to take it home. And of course he just went and took it to the back and we never saw it again. We were both disappointed. We typically have a great experience here but he killed it. I didn't catch his name because he didn't tell us it. I hope they review the customer surveys at the end when you pay. He is the 2nd person EVER I have tipped under 15%.

Ashly C.,"Anchorage, AK",157,1,,1.0,9/15/2015,"My wife and I go out each week & eat somewhere different every time. Now I'm not the one to complain because I understand the works of working restaurant.   But, I had such a bad and disgusting experience with this company, others should know.   I received a gift card from a girlfriend of mine & thought well this could be our weekly date. It all started with us standing at the door for 15 mins waiting on someone to show us to our table; mind you I called 30 mins before to check if they had open tables which they did, 5 of them & the whole bar was open. Not only did 4 of the waitresses walk past us, but two couples who walked in after us got seated before we did. So when it finally came down to us getting our table our waitress gave us attitude and said ""well you guys should have called before hand and made sure we weren't busy"".   The table itself was never washed or even wiped down nor was the baby seat my TEN MONTH OLD baby had to use. It appeared to be mash potatoes with hair in it. I asked our ""waitress"" nicely if she would mind whipping them down for us & she basically said that wasn't her job. Not only was I just pissed off I should have known I would have this experience considering the one on Abbott closed down years before.  Anyway we order our food, which to my suprise only took 20 mins. I ordered a 16 ounce steak (med rare) normal mash potatoes ,  my wife ordered the pork tacos & we ordered our son some cheese quesadillas. I got my plate and of course my steak was so over cooked it was hard to chew and they put bacon and cheese and chives on my potatoes, asked them kindly to remake it and they did, the second time they did ok with the steak still not med rare BUT they put so much ""garlic butter"" on the top that it over powered my food, who puts a table spoon of garlic butter on steak & not on the plain chunky potatoes. Long story short, my son's kids meal was warm watered down chocolate milk and what looked to be 2 CORN CHIPS WITH CHEESE IN THE MIDDLE. So my baby had to eat only his mash potatoes.   Our waitress told us she was not able to take off the kids meal but she could take off ONE OF the steaks plates that she brought us, they wouldn't even fix the nasty plate they brought me the 2nd time around. Normally you leave with either a empty plate or you take the food home. We left with about 5 bites taken outta everything minus the potatoes. I was actually so disgusted and still hungry that I went over  to BURGER KING, HAHAHA which was the absolute best $5 I EVER SPENT.   If you want nasty food, a dirty eviorment & shitty service go here. no wonder why they closed down the one on Abbott.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6?start=20
Sierra L.,"Kenai, AK",0,5,1,1.0,10/8/2016,"AWFUL! Went here tonight with family and honestly left. We had a reservation and came in at the time that it was set for and the staff was rude as hell! I could not believe how rude they were. We waited for 45 minutes at the bar, 45 minutes past our reservation! And there was open tables but the disrespectful staff would not seat us! Finally they said they could seat the five of us. We got seated, our orders were taken and two other tables next to ours were seated and got their food before us! We waited more than an hour for our food and it hit an hour an a half after ordering our food and still nothing. NO FOOD! Meanwhile the tables next to ours are happily eating. Finally we said F**** it and asked a waitress for the manager and she has the nerve to tell us ""well he's busy right now so you'll need to wait."" And this woman was sassy as hell! And I replied with ""I WANT YOUR MANAGER NOW!"" So this guy comes up to us and tells hi I'm the manager what do you need? We explained the situation to him and said were are leaving this is ridiculous please give us the bill for our drinks we will not be eating here. After we left (starving!) we went to Lone Star Steakhouse and that was the best decision we made. Lone Star was great! Amazing service and amazing new menu! And the manager is fantastic!

After parusing the delicious items on the menu I finally thought that I had made the perfect choice, it was a taco dish,  it was pictured is a completely assembled taco and the description  stated the tacos were toped with a  cilantro slaw which sounded different & delicious.  When my tacos arrived they were not assembled as pictured and I had to build them myself.  The cilantro slaw that I expected to be on top of my taco was a small pile of shredded cabbage with no cilantro or no kind of dressing. I tried to ask the waitress where the cilantro was in the slaw and she just looked at me puzzled and asked if I wanted some cilantro  added to the pile of shredded cabbage.  I ended up feeling foolish and apologizing because I thought I may have read the menue description wrong.  On the way out I checked the menue and it clearly stated that the tacos were topped with a cilantro slaw. The picture and a description sounded delicious however the cook at that location has aparently taken some liberties on presentation & preparation   And I assume this is not the product Chili's intended to serve  as the description is completely different than what I was served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6?start=40

Michael L.,"Anchorage, AK",0,3,5,2.0,5/26/2014,"For a brand new restaurant opening in Anchorage the first few days are critical. Word of mouth up here is the best advertising you can get.  When people are walking out the door on opening day saying things like ""it wasn't that great"" you have a serious problem.  My wife and I waited about 25 minutes for a table. It was exactly as predicted and expected so I cannot fault the staff. Anecdotally I have heard several people were given the same expectation but waited over an hour before leaving. My experience was that the wait time quoted was accurate just about to the minute.  The staff was pleasant and the interior has a wonderfully clean,  modern look.  It's too bad about the food though. My bacon cheeseburger tasted like they just dipped the patty in Salt and the bun was really tough.  The plating and presentation of the food was very modern in appearance (in line with the decor of the restaurant).  There was a long rectangular plate for my burger and a metal basket lined with paper for my fries.  It was intriguing, but eating a burger over a rectangular plate that's half full is not logistically sound. A round plate or a square plate would have worked much better.  Being that this is a restaurant my rating has to reflect the quality of the food first. Maybe in a few weeks we'll try again and see if the quality has improved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6?start=40
Michael S.,"Troy, IL",0,12,,2.0,7/12/2014,"Food was ok, but the service was horrible.  The greeter/seater at the front door was possibly the rudest restaurat person I've ever met.  I've been eating in restaurants all over the world for 30+ years.  Our server took our order and that's the last time we saw him.  Someone else brought our food out and not once did we get asked if the food was ok or if we needed refills on our drinks.  Will we ever go back to this Chili's again?  Heck no.  Save your money, eat somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6?start=40
Kelli Y.,"Anchorage, AK",0,2,,2.0,11/25/2014,They seem to have changed the food since the last time it was opened.  I could have done better by eating at a fast food joint.  Bring the old Chili's back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6?start=40
Tammy B.,"Anchorage, AK",0,10,4,1.0,8/3/2014,"If you remember the Chili's before, the great staff, the fast fun friendly service, and the great food and drinks. This place? Well this place is NOT it. Oh, man. I mean where does one even begin. The fist time we went. The waiter that took our order, he only brought our drinks after a reminder and 20 minutes of patiently waiting... Drinks that were less than impressive we sat... and sat and watched as three other people came in, sat down, got waited on, were served, paid their bills, and left by the other waitress serving in our area... WHERE was the freaking guy? Hell if we knew. And we weren't the only two, the two tables/couples that were next to us they were experiencing the same problems and we all sort of developed this camaraderie over it. So finally, that waitress attending the other side sort of stopped and asked if we were okay. We explained the problem and she went and got our waiter. It was 15 minutes later when he brought out our appetizer and food all at the same time. Blaming the kitchen. I had fajitas and my partner had that appetizer platter mix up, which two of the things he ordered on it were wrong and one was missing.  Best part. Everything you are supposed to get for the fajita... I didn't get. Just meat and tortillas... Which, were much smaller than the Original Chili's. What the hell am I supposed to do with meat and floury bread. We had NO drinks and our food was jacked. The waitress went by again and noticed the problem instantly. She than ran off and got our waiter, my condiments, and the rest of my partners order. By this time though we were pissed. And when it was brought to the mangers attention... he/she NEVER came to see us, nothing, they discounted our meal.... by removing the drinks. After than and you remove the drinks?! I was livid. We literally had the worst service in history, we never got refills on our drinks, we weren't even asked till the very end and we had originally finished those off within the first 20 minutes we were there, and in total we were there  for almost 2 hours!!! The second time we went wasn't as bad  but was no better. We made sure to get a table not in that guys section and funny part was, as we came in, he dropped his tray of drinks and dumped it all over my pumps. With no apologies. I should have left, I really should have but we stayed. We got put back by the bathrooms... JOY... and then we waited, waited, and waited. We eventually got or drinks, got our food, and it again was wrong. Problem was... after 15 minutes waiting for her to come back so we could tell her, we gave up and ate it anyway. We even had pushed the ""call server"" button on that stupid device. Drinks were never refilled... and the food was just not worth the stress of it. We haven't been back since. It is not the same as it was before and I can't see them ever improving it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-anchorage-6?start=40
