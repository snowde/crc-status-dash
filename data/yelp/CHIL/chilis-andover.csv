Kay S.,"Woburn, MA",0,36,,2.0,10/2/2017,"Came in to grab some take out. Got chips and salsa as we were waiting and not sure if they changed the recipe but it was so watered down and flavor less.  Although our food was good when we got home, so no complaints there.  But as we were waiting there was a lot to look at regarding the staff. As a previous server, being on the cell phone is a big no-no. As the waitress sitting down behind us was scrolling through for a while, what was worse was the manager was behind the bar and would not stop looking at his phone! Was very unprofessional! He seemed to be someone who has a huge ego.  And there was this waiter who would not stop singing along with the restaurant music. He was so loud and clearly wanted attention.   Sorry....didn't come to a karaoke bar nor to hear someone singing terribly!  Need to reanalyze the management and staff to succeed in professionalism.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover

K I.,"Austin, TX",0,60,2,2.0,10/24/2017,"The restaurant is open while under renovation.  We entered at dinner time and waited for some time, probably a good five minutes, before the hostess finally walk out from the back.  Our server came and took our order, not writing anything down, then came back not once, but twice to confirm our appetizer and dinner order.  The queso was very spicy and salty but was barely warm.  The chips were okay, except half the basket was crumbs.  Not plates for the queso and chips so we ate off our napkins, dripping cheese all over the place.  Entrees were no better.  Everything taste so salty.  Should have turned around and walked out when no one was there to greet us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover

Zhenya Y.,"Snellville, GA",18,8,,1.0,7/3/2017,"The only stars I could possibly give this establishment are left of zero. I am actually being very kind and courteous  by providing one star. Anyways, I came here with my family last night on 7/2/17 at around 7:45pm. We were very hungry and just wanted to order right away. We walk through the door and wait 5 minutes to be seated. The hostess who greeted us was not friendly at all and gave us attitude right off the bat. We get seated and have to wait 15 minutes along with another family that walked in right in front of us. After waiting, my brother in law got up to look for someone to help us, but couldn't find anyone. We asked the first waiter we saw since we came in and he quickly got defensive and said ""I ain't yo waiter!"" and we said"" Excuse me sir? We have been waiting for the past 15 minutes and have not been served yet, is there anyone here who could help us?"" ""Like I said I aint yo waiter"" ""Well can you please find someone?"" ""Fine!"". We walked right out as did the other family that arrived with us. They actually waited longer than us since we were already out on the parking lot when they came out.  Honestly worst service ever. Do not recommend. We had a two year old with us who was out way past his bedtime and was very hungry. Who in the world keeps kids hungry? Dont come here people. Please.

Sara B.,"North Andover, MA",38,31,,2.0,3/8/2017,"My coworkers and I order take-out from this Chili's on a regular basis. Every time we order salads, none of the customizations are ever applied.  I ordered a salad today, and paid extra to have avocado on my salad. When I got back to work, I opened my to go box, and no avocado. There should be a Chili's team member who checks the order before it is bagged to go- I am a little tired of paying extra money each time I order take out and none of the items I order are correct.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover
Jenni L.,"St Pete Beach, Tampa Bay, FL",219,408,237,1.0,8/13/2015,"I'm a big fan of the Chili's chain of restaurants, but this is one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  We were staying at the adjacent hotel and decided to stop over for a ""quick"" dinner after a long day on the road. Ha! It was clear as soon as we walked in that they were understaffed. It took over 5 minutes for someone to greet us and show us to our table.  Our server kept forgetting what we ordered to drink - came back twice to confirm what we got.  We shared the 2-for-20 meal. It literally took 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out. We thought maybe the server forgot to put in our order, but she was nowhere to be found to ask her. When she finally came out with it, she just dropped it on the table and walked away without saying anything to us at all. Rude!  Our meal came after another ridiculously long wait and both chicken dishes tasted bland and rubbery. Not at all like they usually do. Drink refills were painfully slow.  I understand that it's not always the servers fault for being understaffed or for the kitchen being backed up, but it's still not appropriate to be rude. An apology for the wait or even a little compassion would have gone a long way. Wasted two hours of our life and over $50. Will never return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover
Bryan S.,"Memphis, TN",22,17,1,1.0,5/30/2016,"I'm sorry guys I tried. I really did (3 times!) because your takeout folks are pretty nice and I wanted a place to eat during my 6 week work trip. But it gets worse every time and today my food was inedible. First try: ordered one of the fish plates with double fish. It was an unusual order apparently so I asked to just get 2 to save time and simplify. Refused said he didn't want me to overpay. Okay. Was told 15 minutes. Gave em 25 just in case. Waited another 30 passed that until finally the takeout dude told me they forgot about my order and left it out. He seemed genuine and said it was fine now and he even scolded the cooks! Took it home only to find that it was ICE COLD. I was starving so I forced it down.  Next try a little less eventful except that they forgot the rice and double meat... figured they were getting better, at least now I got warm food. Tried one more time. Super simple just give me a steak, medium. Now I'm looking at a piece of raw meat as I hungrily write this review. I'm not talking pink rare-this piece is cold and purple throughout except for the most outer layer. Even the fries are stale. :( Sorry I'm done.

Craig S.,"Tewksbury, MA",41,46,,1.0,5/15/2016,"UNDERSTAFFED, COLD FOOD DELIVERED 45 MINUTES AFTER BEING ORDERED, OVERWORKED WAIT STAFF, MANAGEMENT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK - OR WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE. My wife and I had a terrible experience last night when we went out to dinner at our local, Chili's Grill and Bar on River Road in Andover, MA (your #1068).   We arrived at 7:30 and saw that the restaurant was not full - probably 60% full with a few larger parties waiting for tables.  We weren't seated right away because the greeter said that the tables needed to be cleaned.  OK - after 10 minutes, she did seat us.   And after being seated, there we sat for 20 min,. before our server came over and asked us if we wanted anything to drink?  We ordered wine - two glasses - one Merlot, the other Pino Giorgio.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited for our drinks - AND TO PLACE AN ORDER.   It was at least another twenty-five minutes before the server came back order to take our order.  My wife ordered the Mango Chicken - I ordered the Fajitas (spell?).  We asked about the wine that we still hadn't received.   The server then told us that they were ""short handed"" and begged our ""forgiveness"".   The wine finally arrived after another 10 minutes.  And the food we ordered didn't arrive until I got mad enough to get up, speak with the greeter and ask to speak with the manager who came over and said ""short staffed, very sorry, apologies"" and rushed off.   We still didn't get our meals.  Finally after another 5 minutes, the food arrived DELIVERED BY THIS MANAGER.  Interesting enough, the food arrived VERY COLD, and flavorless.  I tried to get the manager's attention about the cold food.  He avoided us every time he ""flew"" by with other people's ""probably cold"" food. This manager is a disaster and his lack of management and customer service skills suggest he should be terminated.  He's shooting himself and his restaurant unit in the foot because no one who might read this and the other Yelp Reviews are likely to return.  Remember on a Saturday night at 7:30 the restaurant was 40% empty.  NO WONDER.  Who would want to duplicate this kind of experience?  No one I know. I have sent a copy of this review to CHILI'S.  Who knows if they'll even read it.  I doubt it for some reason.  God help other restaurant visitors to this unit if their experience is anything like ours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover

Bill B.,"South El Monte, CA",638,409,2442,5.0,1/25/2014,Visited this restaurant two evenings in a row while on business travel. The front desk team and the lady who took my to go order were very professional friendly extremely conscientious. I Was offered a complimentary drink when I waited for my to go order in the bar. The bar has some very cool dark blue neon lighting. I had salmon which was a huge portion perfectly great Grilled and seasonsed to perfection. This the first Chili's that actually placed my side orders to go in separate containers that's a major league plus. Normally Chiles just carelessly slops them them in the to go container. The large size to go drinks are much greater in quantity then if you order in. My side dishes were piping hot firm perfectly prepared.

Jesse J.,"Lowell, MA",0,38,10,2.0,7/28/2015,"Slipped in for a working lunch. Chili's is attached to a hotel, in this very, very business-oriented area-- I think there are 6 office parks within 2 miles. It was quiet-- no one at the bar and only about 3 other tables were occupied.  Pulled out my laptop, looked for WiFi network ... Huh? None??? EVERY Chili's has WiFi. What the heck is going on here? Ok, no big deal. My company gives me an air card for use.  But I'm low on juice... I looked around again-- not a single outlet under any table whatsoever??!  You've got to be kidding me.  I inquired of the waitress  she seemed to agree. ""I have no idea why we're not set up with wifi. It makes no sense to me either,"" she replied.

I must admit though, that I have been loyal to chilis as far as time goes. Have almost tried everything on their menu and like most of the items. Its not a great culinary experience, but it is satisfying both pocket wise and stomach wise. Above average portion sizes and drink sizes. Like their choco lava cake to finish things off.

Frannie Z.,"Haverhill, MA",24,378,37,3.0,1/21/2013,"Chili's makes good nachos. Chili's makes good nachos? Chili's makes good nachos! I've never before gotten the nachos at Chili's so (as you can see) I am mildly surprised that they do a good job. Although I will admit seeing single nachos lined up around the edge of the plate was a bit disappointing, I got over it quickly. I realized that each and every one of these nachos has exactly the perfect amount of topping PLUS the tortilla was still crispy. I must say, I would prefer 12 absolutely perfect nachos to a plate full of no cheese on the bottom, toppings falling off nachos. I seem to have more difficulty with either the service or the space at Chili's than the actual food. Last time at a different location we had a loony waitress. This time, the waiter was awesome but they stuck our group in the bar. Now, mind you, we were there at 5PM and the dining room was empty. They had a huge double booth that would have fit the 7 of us just fine. The bar was so loud I couldn't hear the people at the other end of the table. By the end of the night I had a headache from having to talk so loud to be heard. I guess my tips would be: 1. Get the nachos 2. Don't sit in the bar unless you have earplugs 3.

I got boneless chicken nuggets, which i returned and while i was waiting for the wings my main course came?  The only resemblance of the sliders to the menu description was it was chicken. Otherwise nothing the menu said was on the plate was actually there. The fries, which it wasn't supposed to come with, we're so salty it ruined the sliders and the wings.

The service is sparse at best, the food is below average, even for a Chili's.  I was looking to go here have a few drinks, have a late lunch and unwind a bit. I left disappointed because the food came out lukewarm, the drinks were tepid and the staff just did not care. I just left my food and drink and left, did not eat it, did not touch it when it came out.  I called out the manager to show the disgrace and the manager asked me what to do about it, I just got up and left at that point.  If I have to suggest to management on what to do then I am in the wrong place to eat.

It took a very long time to get our food and when we wanted to order dessert, we had to ask another waitress to find our waitress. When we got our bill we learned that she had overcharged us for a meal and when asked to correct it she fixed it and said ""I fixed your bill"" and mumbled under her breath ""even though it was only 99 cents"".

After a long day of driving around New Hampshire, we were headed back south and the dinner bells were chiming. GPS directed us to Chilis. I haven't been to Chili's so I had no idea how long they would take, especially on a Saturday night. We were seated within 10 minutes which was surprising as the places was packed and there were about 10 people waiting when we got there. After ordering appetizers and dinners, my friend and I chatted for a few minutes and  were surprised to see dinner arrive (appetizers had no come out yet, but hey we had only ordered about 8 minutes ago)  My friend pointed out that we had not received  appetizers yet. I was willing to take dinner first, but before I could say anything it was gone. 2 minutes later, Travis, the manager appeared with our appetizers. He  told us that ""no one should have to wait 11 minutes for an appetizers"" and that he was going to deduct it from the bill. WTF?!?!  11 minutes?? I dont complain until after over 30 minutes, on a slower night. Then he asked if we wanted anything else, so I decided to try the Blackberry iced tea (delicious!!) Eva, our waitress, came over to let me know she was getting the iced tea 2 minutes after I asked the manager. They both came over within the next 2 minutes with my tea. Yeah!!
