Colby T.,"Wilmington, NC",9,15,12,4.0,3/9/2015,"We love Chili's and this was our first time at this location. We put our names on the list and were told the wait would be 25 minutes. There was only one couple in front of us when we arrived. While waiting, we washed our hands and noticed four tables in just that one section by the restrooms that were clean and ready for use. We waited about five minutes and another came in and were seated before we were.  The host just left and did not check in the other parties waiting or seat us at any of the open tables. Finally, a manager came and seated us.  The food was great and the waitress was amazing. I would give five stars if it weren't for the bad job of the host.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Kandra G.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",17,54,76,1.0,2/28/2015,"The hostess needs to take her job seriously or the boss shouldn't hire her cousin because it started our lunch off wrong. So here we go. We walked into the restaurant and the hostess was leaning on the podium and carelessly asked us where we wanted to sit. No ""hello, welcome Chilli's.""  No ""How many people are in your party?"" Just ""bar or table"". We told her several times that we didn't care, but she literally didn't move. I told my lunch guest to decide and went to the restroom because I was getting disgusted by her lack of a desire to assist us. When I returned, we were in the bar area. This was a huge problem because the bar was packed and the one bartender had to serve the people at the bar and those at all the tables surrounding it. He was too overwhelmed so we had to return to the hostess stand where there were other people waiting to be seated but NO hostess for at least 10 mins. We stopped very busy waitress and asked her to get the manager. Even after we were seated, the hostess didn't return to her place for another 5 to 7 minutes. UGH! the manager...all I can say is that she must have trained that waitress herself. She faked a polite smile but did seat us immediately and take our orders correctly. Finally we are greeted by Sue who must be the hardest working person that restaurant had there today. She took over serving us. She was very polite, attentive, and busy. Our waitress is the only reason that this restaurant gets its 1 star and although the food was good, I can't give them an extra star. (I had the Cajun pasta with both chicken and shrimp and my friend had the chicken burger with swiss cheese and a ceasar salad.) By the way, the manager did not offer any type of apology, or a discount, a free appetizer or dessert for our troubles and she could clearly see that I was very upset by the treatment we had received thus far. Lastly and I really had debated with myself about adding this, but Sue got into a screaming match with another employee right at the doorway to the kitchen. We watched this for a few minutes before the other employee noticed us and suggested they good somewhere else. Well that somewhere else into the kitchen, only another 10 feet, so yes, I was still able to witness the fight.  Would I recommend anyone else eat at Chili's in Annapolis? Absolutely not!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Ryan B.,"Austin, TX",28,63,428,2.0,12/25/2014,"Chili's, where have you gone?  Once upon a time (even just a year ago, really) - One could go to a Chili's and get a fairly decent meal on a consistent basis. Based upon the food I received from this (and a few other) locations, I'm not too sure that is possible anymore. To go with my meal, I ordered a cup of their chicken enchilada soup which was nearly as watery as broth - as if they only had so much left in the pot and threw some water in to ""stretch it out."" For my meal, I had ordered a burger - medium well. To say this burger was well done would be an understatement and it was, quite literally (legacy definition of 'literally', not the new expanded definition) burnt - and had almost no flavor. Are any spices (even salt/pepper) added to the burger as it cooks? I was basically eating a burnt piece of meat in a bun.  The service at this location also left a lot to be desired, but it was the poor quality of the food that shocked me the most. I'll not be returning to this Chili's location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Dave S.,"Annapolis, MD",75,267,22,1.0,12/10/2014,I've had ups and downs with this Chilis store before. Some management has been helpful others not. Today I had a solid hour between customers and stopped for lunch. Surprise! They couldn't get me lunch in enough time to get going. It took ten minutes just to pay for my drink. A solid and consistent loser. Too bad. I enjoy the Chilis menu. This store can't deliver.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Caroline G.,"Annapolis, MD",1,32,65,5.0,9/6/2015,"Excellent. Ate there today with brother and husband. Food was great. Prompt service. We had a male waiter, didn't catch his name but he was awesome. He brought our food quickly; we were in and out within an hour. He also kept our waters full and remembered to bring the A1 steak sauce I requested.  Plating and cooking of food was nice. My steak was cooked properly to my request; well done but not burned. Endless chips and salsa was great to have at the table for an appetizer. We got two dinner for $20 meals which was a good deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Nohely R.,"West Henrietta, NY",0,26,42,1.0,1/4/2015,Worst Chilis we've been too. My husband and I ordered the bottomless soup and salad. His salad was literally frozen and his soup came in a bowl half the size of mine. Probably won't be coming back to this place anymore.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Franck W.,"Baltimore, MD",34,25,,1.0,12/23/2013,"It was a horrible time that I have spent there with my friends, 3 hours of just waiting, what could I say about what happened is just four words "" WHAT A H**L IS THAT "" 3 hours until I getting bored of waiting with my buddies, one of my friends try to persuade us to keeping wait there all that time because he thought that place is awesome for party and friends weekend soiree . The story began when a friend ask us to spend the weekend night on Coconut Joe's Bar & Grill, actually I am already planned to take a brunch there but I was a little dubious from this plan being a bad plan, anyway I persuaded by this idea, after sunset we drive through, when we arrived we find the bar full of patrons, so we decided to wait .... And wait .... And wait .... and hated ourselves from waiting till one of us try to ask the server ""when we can take a seat "" however other people came after us and take their serves before us, I didn't know what's the problem ? is it our or them ?  After three hour we find a unoccupied place so we took it immediately, everything after that were dark with me, the serves was very bad, the food was horrible, the drink was terrible nothing was good, only thing kept me Patience was the ocean view, but I am too disgruntled from this dark feeling I had it there, anyways I will never ever go there again, if I did that I'll deserve what gonna happen to me . If anyone else who don't see what did I sow and have a good time there, they would give Coconut Joe's Bar a 5 star, unfortunately I give 1 star if not less because I'm talking about myself . I hope the server there note that and take care about the new patrons .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Ruth H.,"Annapolis, MD",0,4,,1.0,8/5/2015,"I used to love Chilis. With that being said, the last two times we've been there, the food and service was terrible! Today, we went there for lunch with our friends  and I asked our server if they had coffee. She said she would go and brew some ""fresh"" coffee for me. It took 20 minutes to bring me one coffee and she only made enough for half a cup. It was cold, very strong and didn't taste right. From there, things went down hill. Our potato soups were cold, they brought our fajitas with no sides. We constantly had to ask for refills and they were the wrong drinks and our server was nowhere to be found. It took forever to get our checks and put the wrong thing on our checks. We had to get our own to go box. Just terrible service! Won't be going there ever again at least not in Annapolis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Ma-e M.,"Baltimore County, MD",0,1416,571,3.0,8/14/2012,"When you are launched to lunch, Chili's got for you a hot lunch special price for $6,$7,$8. This combo comes with some french fries, a choice of side (soup or salad), and a choice of half (not whole) sandwich. When lunch time is short, get it to go, order online before picking up; this way is quicker. Chevy's though has a nicer decor of real Mexican place. If you are really in for a long duration of happy hour, but boring crowd, at Chili's the hours are extended from 2PM to 8PM.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
S C.,"Arnold, MD",0,10,,1.0,9/2/2015,"Did anyone order a screaming baby to arrive with their dinner?  The manager, Tamara did nothing about this screaming child, whom the parents ignored.  She offered to move us, but we had finished eating.  She told us she's ""not allowed to say anything about it to the parents.""  Since when?  If someone is too loud and obnoxious at the bar because they're drunk they are asked to leave, but a baby who is bothering everyone (except apparently the parents) should not be asked to leave?  Tamara and Chilis need to look up the law and wake up and realize you can ask them to quiet the baby or leave or just lose many, many customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Misty D.,"Odenton, MD",60,114,1898,3.0,6/19/2009,"We know what Chili's is all about, so I'll just provide a few insights for taking the kids: 1)  The day we went for lunch, the manager was greeting patrons at the door.  He held the door open for us, told us his name, and asked us to notify him if we had any questions/issues.  I thought that this was a nice touch. 2)  The kids' menu has 11 entree choices (including a healthy grilled chicken platter and a not-so-healthy rib basket).  Prices range from $3.99-$6.99 and include a side (hooray--fruits and veggies offered!) and drink.  The activity book was cute and kept Chickadee occupied. 3)  There is a changing table in the women's room. 4)  Our waitress was friendly to Chickadee and checked on us often. I ordered from the Guiltless Grill (black bean burger).  In all, a decent meal at a good price.  The couple at the next table was nice enough to allow me to take quick photos of their lunches as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Nicholas G.,"Fresno, CA",45,11,2,2.0,9/27/2013,"Food was decent, but has anyone seen the new pay by machine? I did not like that it makes the whole dining experience way too impersonal. If I wanted that kind of service I'd go to royal farms or a buffet at least there you are not expected to tip",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Judeth L.,"Annapolis, MD",0,19,,5.0,6/1/2014,"This is our go to place for date night. Usually I am very critical of restaurants, especially when it comes to cleanliness and I have not found something I complain about yet. The atmosphere is very comfortable and quiet. We don't have to yell to talk to one another. The waiters we have had have been really good and attentive. The food has always been good and consistent. The one thing I wish they would do is switch up the 2 for $20 choices every once and awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Jake T.,"Evans, GA",10,72,48,1.0,2/13/2013,Dirty silverware. Shitty service. Waitress brought my wife her food and forgot to place my order with the kitchen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Gia H.,"Germantown, MD",13,44,,5.0,8/3/2009,"We went here for lunch on a Friday on our way to the Outlets.. Wouldn't usually write about a chain restaurant like this, but honestly I have never been to a Chili's like this before.  The food quality is 100% better than any other Chili's I have been to.  You do not go to Chili's expecting a gourmet meal, merely just a meal that is going to taste good. However, I got a quesdilla explosion salad like I do any other time I go here, but the presentation and flavor in this salad was unlike no other.  I should have taken a picture of the salad.  It actually looked like a salad you would receive in a higher end restaurant.  I would literally just go back to this chili's for their presentation.   Service was good too..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
Jeff P.,"Annapolis, MD",58,107,19,4.0,8/9/2010,"Great!  They redeemed the concept of flair for me! The service was terrific and the food was awesome. I had the famous baby back ribs.  As good as any, if not better than most BBQ places. This is one franchise I will recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-annapolis-2
