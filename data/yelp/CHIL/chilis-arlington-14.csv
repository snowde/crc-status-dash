Chica B.,"Crofton, MD",0,54,33,2.0,5/4/2015,"For the same price paid including a glass of wine and dessert Legal Seafood did much better. I felt bad no for the food or the restaurant but for my friends who came from Colombia to eat ""restaurant"" ribs even though they had ribs days before at my house. They absolutely did not like it, it was only bones, no meat on it, they found the ribs spicy (they don't like spicy food).  I told them it was the rub since they don't use to, neither do I, eat ribs drench in sauce. I had the fish tacos and the pico the gallo on top made it worst, I love to enjoy the food but that pico was way too spicy.  I know what pico de gallo is and taste but that one was a little bit way too much spicy. Server, slow, and it was only Tuesday, restaurant was empty and don't know how to handle cash and credit card to split a check. Not coming back and will not recommend to friends or family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=20

Eric L.,"Alexandria, VA",106,403,63,3.0,1/16/2014,Really... it's Chili's... I don't know what to say.  It's not like you get 5 star food at this place... but I will admit they give you decent service and decent price for some lunch deals.   I'm a fan of their sweet potato fries when they don't cover them in salt. It's hard to be healthy at this place... even their salads are full of sugar and carbs with all fruit and sweet dressing that goes on it.  Outside of all that... it's Chili's.  You go to Chili's to expect Chili's... so I can't complain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=20

Ryan Z.,"Washington, DC",63,590,8,3.0,9/1/2014,"Ended up here totally by chance, and it wasn't half bad, but certainly not amazing. The $20 dinner for two is a real bargain, offering an appetizer and two entrees for that price. Our starter was the chips and guacamole. The chips were very thin and the guacamole was too icy cold and needed more lime. The chicken fajitas of course looked better in the picture but tasted pretty good. The baby back ribs are always a good choice and were very tender. Service was attentive and it looked like the staff works well as a team. All the bar tables now have a tablet which you can use to order and pay your tab, which is kind of gimmicky, but at least it puts you in control of paying your tab.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=20

I ordered from the lower calorie menu and got the chile-mango chicken. It was pretty good. Not as good as my Turkey Sandwhich, but it had to do. The service is always good and if you register online at their website they will send you coupons for free apps and dessert.

Tessie E.,"Arlington, VA",288,92,192,5.0,8/3/2015,"Soo... my review of another Chili's in Bailey's Crossroads and my absolutely horrible experience there led me to give them another shot at the behest of corporate. The service there was wonderful. We got the happy hour triple dipper samplers with mine being double boneless wings and southwestern egg rolls. They really gave me like 20 boneless wings which was so cool of them (should have gotten 8-9) and my bf got the sliders, wings, and tenders. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly and my faith has been restored in Chilis (this one at least). Oh, btw, for all of that our bill came out to under 15 dollars.

The servers I've had are never happy, maybe that is indicative of the way their employers treat them, who knows.  In any case, expect to get ignored, have your order screwed up or even forgotten entirely, and have your party's dishes come out at all different times.

Nicole W.,"Panama City Beach, FL",0,22,9,1.0,3/3/2015,"What a horrible experience! We tried coming here after Legal Seafoods was busy next door. Our group and another group were quickly ignored at the host table for a group that came in a few minutes after us - I hate to say it was a race issue, but it was blatantly clear the host did not like any of the groups except the one he priority seated. Once seated our server came over and introduced the computer on the table as his ""best friend"". We should have taken his advice and used it because he forgot to put in our order at all. Food took over an hour to come out once he realized his mistake and tried to blame it elsewhere. He was extremely unattentive, never refilling our drinks. When the time came for checks, he forgot and then asked us to use the machine. We finally lost it on him and told him to bring us the checks to the table. He never returned to the table, but the manager did for a 50% discount. The manager had no idea any of this had happened. Great communication. Once the server never returned to the table we paid through the computer as we couldn't stand to be there any longer. 1- Avoid this place at all costs 2- It is pathetic that servers have lost all customer service ability and reality due to the presence of these server machines",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=20

Jonathan M.,"Washington, DC",32,63,21,4.0,3/7/2012,"To quote a fellow Arlingtonian, ""You can call it Trans-fat. I call it happiness."" It's not that I'm low brow, or a bottom feeder... I just like a good grease bomb every now and then.  hoity toity restaurants have their place. But on a Friday Night after a long week of doing the Gov'ment's bidding, I need a place to unwind with a frosty beer mug and some fatty comfort food. There's peace in knowing that I will in no way be able to rationalize the terror that I am about to unleash on my stomach. Chili's usually keeps itself honest with this ideology, and I'm a huge fan of that.  Chili's isn't always the best at service, and the food there lacks a certain originality. But its not designed to woo you. Its designed to DESTROY you!  I came in for a Friday happy hour early and squatted on two bar tables at once. When the waiter asked me if I had a bigger group coming, I said yes, and he helped me rearrange the furniture to fit my incoming group. That was a class move, I thought. The Happy Hour here isn't bad at all...cheap drinks, low priced appetizers from the Happy Hour List. I ordered the Bacon Bigmouth Bites with ranch dressing and made sure to pester the server for more onion strings. He delivered, and with a smile. That goes a long way in my book.  It's noisy, but you know that. It's Chili's, not the Palm. I can't tell you how many times I've been to a Chili's over the years. There not all a homerun, that's for sure. But I have to say you know what you're going to get. I hope it's a massive Margarita that would make Michael Scott and the Dunder Mifflanites jealous, (and or sloshed), and the bacon Bigmouth Burger (that I immediately regretted not ordering). Ultimately, I find myself comparing every single burger I eat to something on the Chili's menu, and as Jules Winfield would say, ""That's a tasty burger"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=40

Jess M.,"Washington, DC",33,204,207,2.0,10/16/2012,"Ugh.  Chili's is where you want to go when you have absolutely no idea what you want to eat, and are fooled into thinking this is a good idea.  Every time I have been here, I've left dissatisfied and regret being hungry enough to walk through the door. The food is not special by any means. It's bland, tasteless, and worst of all, overpriced.  For example, the wings. Fried to produce a mediocre crispness, then bathed in a thin sauce of disappointment resembling Texas Pete hot sauce and butter. $10. Gone.  Don't let the menu pictures fool you, or the sound of the sizzling skillet. I learned the hard way by ordering chicken fajitas the other night. I mean- how do you screw up fajitas?! Well, Chili's apparently screws them up by adding zero seasoning, and upcharging you for rice and beans. They were terrible. I hated every second. $15. Gone.  So take my advice, if you're in Crystal City, and the thought of going here crosses your mind, immediately punch yourself in the face, and walk down the street to Kabob Palace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=40
Jon N.,"Garden Grove, CA",225,548,58,4.0,10/12/2010,"My friend and I needed a place to chill for a few hours before our flight out, so why not chill and Chili's?  (Hold the applause). Was here on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty much empty.  Nice!  There were a few people in the dining area and bar downing a few in the middle of the afternoon. Had myself a burger cooked medium rare.  I like how they actually cooked it how I ordered it, unlike many other places which overcook the meat. Fries are alright but the burger made up for the lack of stellar fries.   Can't really say much for the service except the our water kept getting refilled even if we finished eating and were just sitting there.  I like American places because they never really pressure you to leave or give you subtle hints like they stop checking up on you.

There are enough good restaurants in this area that you shouldn't have to waste your money or allowed caloric intake at a gosh-darned Chili's. HOWEVER--that being said, this place offers something that most places in crystal city don't, which is a decent salad. I know that the salads here don't exactly qualify as health food, but sometimes you just need some greens, ya know? I've only been here twice, but I try to cut the calories by getting dressing on the side, holding the bacon, switching from fried to grilled chicken, etc. Chili's is Chili's, meaning they usually earn about a 1-star review. In this location, the pure existence of salads on their menus, combined with the fact that it holds the hours you would expect from a chain restaurant, means it gets an extra star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=40

Everything is pre-made, canned, frozen, and industrialized in flavor and texture.          The primary problem here is the parking....in that it's non existent.

Last thing: I have an annoying tendency to lose my credit card at restaurants.  Most restaurants make the process of getting your credit card back extremely unpleasant and difficult (ie. make sure never to leave your stuff at Science Club, you will never see it again or receive any assistance whatsoever in tracking it down).  This Chili's was different however.  When I initially called the next morning the phone was answered and the friendly guy looked in the safe and didn't see it.  He took down my number ""just in case"" and said he would talk to some people, but I figured he was just being polite and wouldn't hear back from him.  I was pleasantly surprised near the end of the day when he called back and said he had found the credit card and put it in the safe.  Of all the times I have lost my credit card somewhere no restaurant has ever been that helpful before.  Good job Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=60

It was a moment of weakness between me and my roommates today as we are all home sick from work. We didn't include a tip because we wanted to tip based on his service, given the already ridiculous delivery and service fees.  The driver was 2 hours late. He arrived a few min. ago and says we owe him cash. I said no I paid via credit card. He continues to aggressively argue with me about this. I go to get my phone to show him my emailed receipt and he interrupts ""Where is my tip."" I said ""Tip??"" He said, ""Yes I need a tip"" I had to forcefully tell him to first confirm with his manager that I indeed paid already and he proceeded to insinuate that we were trying to not pay when he called over his walkie talkie. I finally had to show him my bank statement on my phone to prove that I had indeed paid. He finally agreed. Then he refused to leave until we had tipped him. I told him he wasn't going to be getting one b/c he was so rude to us and had taken 2 hours to get us our food. He refused to leave until we had given him money. At this point, he was so threatening that I basically tried to shove a dollar at him (not very nice, I know, but I was so shocked by his attitude) He then decided to leave.

Marianne L.,"Alexandria, VA",225,620,330,3.0,5/3/2009,"Had a great lunch here with some colleagues last week and it was mostly because of our waiter (Mario?). After a huge disappointment at Matsutake the day before, I suggested Chili's as the spot for a quick lunch during a week of meetings and conference on-site with clients. My usual Chili's experience is with the one in Baileys Crossroads (where the food can be hit or miss sometimes) but I knew that the menu would have something for everyone and most likely would be a solid, affordable and quick option. Wasn't disappointed.  We started with chips and then all opted for ""sliders"". Mine plain chicken crispers, my companions the bbq crispers and big bite burgers. (NOTE: the big bite burgers are just a regular hamburger patty that has been quartered.) Our server was nicely attentive and kept our glasses filled. The food came out fast and he was there when we needed but not when we didn't. I especially liked the jovial approach he had as he did his work. As we were leaving a see of young grade school children arrived, filling the section we'd been seated in. I made a comment to one of my co-workers about leaving before the volume reached an untenable level. Our waiter overheard, and just gave us a smile and a shrug and set about getting the large party settled with menus. If I'm trapped in Crystal City on business again - I'll almost assuredly be back for lunch. (NOTE: The map shows this place in completely the wrong location.

I stopped in 6/28/13 at about 8:30pm and the young woman working the reception was away from her station. I waited patiently. When she returned, she stepped around me and began helping the people second in line, who came in behind me. They were then seated. Uh, hello?  When she got back to me, she somewhat rudely asked if she could help me. I pointed out that I'd been there before the people she just seated, as I thought she should know. She dismissively said she didn't see me, though she had to have seen me - she actually had to vary her path to literally get *around* me - I was standing right in front of her podium! If she hadn't seen me, she would've run into me. But whatever. I asked for a table and she told me there was a 40 minute wait. What?? There was an empty table 10 feet behind her, not far inside the door. I rather stared at her, but couldn't even fathom why I'd bother to ask about it. By then I was so disgusted that there was no way I was spending a dime in this place. I immediately left.  There are other restaurants a few blocks away. I strongly urge you to look further.

Caitlin C.,"Alexandria, VA",18,63,24,2.0,2/23/2011,"This was not a good experience overall, but let me start with saying that the service was the most disappointing. My boyfriend used to work at this Chili's a few years ago. Back then, he said that the majority of the waitstaff and managers were usually too doped up to be of much help and that they used to sell drugs to the tenants in the apartment complex upstairs. Maybe it's not like that anymore. My boyfriend and I came mid-afternoon (about 3:00) and it was practically empty. We sat in the dining area. Our server had a couple tables, but she didn't seem to have the time to take our drinks or food orders before she excessively talked up the tip with some military guys at another table. We ordered the chips and salsa (delicious as usual and my favorite!) which we quickly finished. Our server came and went with our food orders but didn't bring more chips until we asked her to. When I asked she seemed annoyed. By this point I know I was! My boyfriend's food came out with the wrong sides. When I mentioned that the side items were incorrect, the server tried to tell me that the kitchen put them on the plate and she didn't want to waste the food? I used to serve at a Chili's in Georgia. We were supposed to check the food before it was brought out to the table. If something was wrong, the cooks could easily fix it while it was still in the kitchen. This way the food would be salvaged and the customer would get the right order. I think our server just messed up the order and didn't want to admit it. Overall the food was O.K. for a Chili's. I have had a much better experience here when I've eaten at the bar (4 stars). My suggestion to anyone interested in trying this Chili's - eat at the bar tables or avoid this Chili's altogether.  I usually love Chili's food and atmosphere, but this particular Chili's didn't do it for me.

Claudia C.,"San Ramon, CA",425,364,444,3.0,4/9/2016,"3 stars for food and 4 stars for service. My friends and I came here 30 minutes before close after a long flight. Honestly, it was the only place we could find that was open around the DCA area.  At this late in the evening, we set our expectations low. We just needed some sustenance to satiate our hunger. Surprisingly though, we had a really attentive server who provided great service despite dining until 30 minutes past closing time. We got the Texas fries and onion rings as apps. Both were delicious. I'd recommend getting either or both if you're here. Where things fell relatively short was the entree. I ordered the mango tilapia which comes with brown rice and steamed vegetables on the side. Flavors were ok...the tilapia was clearly frozen and defrosted, the vegetables needed a couple more minutes of steaming and were old, and the brown rice didn't really taste like anything. Our party of four ended up leave with a bill around $50 including drinks so I can't really complain about the price. It's definitely a great place for apps and food is reasonably priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14
Latasha T.,"Detroit, MI",0,7,,1.0,5/27/2016,"Honestly this restaurant deserve 0 stars. I dined in at this restaurant tonight with my family while on vacation from out of state and after witnessing the server take our appetizers to the wrong table and then bring the exact order to us we knew this place was disgusting. I can understand a restaurant not wanting to waste product; however, the restaurant also expects that business goes well. And in order to achieve great results you have to put in great efforts... I asked the server politely if they could remake the order and the server was combative and argued with me. I asked to speak to the manager and he said that he was one of the mangers. Wow! Surprising, so I asked to speak with another manager. He went to the back, came back out, and apologized about his actions and said that it would be 10 minutes for a fresh order. I appreciated his apology and it made the experience a little better.  After 10 minutes a new server brought the appetizers out and I tasted the Texas style fries, and the fries tasted reheated and old: anyone who loves fries knows the difference between fresh and old fries. After realizing that the exact order was re-served to us when the walking manager came and asked how our experience was I explained the issue. He said he was a general manager from another store filling in because they were short staffed here, and he had the general manager come over and speak to us. I explained to her what we experienced and as the GENERAL MANAGER she argued with me.  I just couldn't believe how bad of a customer experience this was! I wouldn't recommend anyone to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14

Thought we would be smart and order drinks a food together. (Hell, we've had plenty of time to look at the menu)  The wait staff looked TERRIBLE. Everyone looked like they had been working for days nonstop. Our waitress was friendly but VERY slow. Even to just get us napkins seemed to take forever.  The two stars I give this location is to the cooks. Steak was cooked PERFECTLY. As for the bartender: a glass of whiskey isn't a mixed drink.

Christine B.,"Bowie, MD",76,92,47,3.0,7/11/2016,"I have never visited this location, and I am unsure if I will again. After being Ina one day conference at an adjacent hotel, it was assumed that this restaurant would be able to accommodate those who desired to eat at this location with more than likely large groups (5 or more). A a party of 7 in a restaurant that appeared to be 30% at capacity, we waited almost 30 minutes before we asked a server if we could just take an empty table. I was notified by one of the servers that they were without a hostess. They also appeared to be understaffed, which both attributed to the unnecessary wait time. When we did sit, our server made her best attempt to try to take care of our table, which is why we stayed and ate. This location needs more staff present to accommodate the patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1453,2370,6598,2.0,1/8/2015,"I really wanted to like this Chili's location.  My bf and I visited on a Saturday around 5pm and it was somewhat empty.   As always, I ordered a big strawberry margarita (and my bf ordered the equally as impressive El President margarita) and truly enjoyed it.  The drinks were great, and are the major reason I'm giving this review 2 stars instead of 1.   The food was OK too (for the most part...) - we ordered tableside guacamole, which was prepared in front of us and tasted fresh.  We also ordered the Southwestern Eggrolls (crispy flour tortilla filled with smoked chicken, blacked beans, corn, jalapeño jack cheese, red peppers, and spinach, served with an avocado ranch dressing). This was tasty too.   However when it came to entrees, I ordered the steak (classic rib eye with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes) and was looking forward to this but our waiter brought it by and I saw his fingers touching my food... like sauce all over his fingers because his fingers were literally in my steak.  I tried eating the other side of the steak but was thoroughly disgusted at this point and didn't eat my entree.  That ruined the experience and we paid for our meal without saying anything and left.  I think the restaurant should  reevaluate its hygienic practices and instruct its employees on sanitary serving.  I doubt I would return to this Chili's, and it's a shame because I loved their drinks and the food I did eat was tasty. I also have historically really enjoyed other Chili's locations. Oh well. Oh, and just a tip - the parking situation in this area is somewhat of a mess and we ended up finding parking at a nearby labyrinthine parking lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14
Diana G.,"Orlando, FL",93,54,5,1.0,10/27/2015,"I highly dislike giving 1 star reviews. However, the lack of customer service in this Chili's is worth noting. A group of 7 people ordered lunch when the restaurant was probably at 20% capacity. Our food took 1 hour to arrive and when I complained that my food was cold, the manager gave me a bit of attitude saying the kitchen had a mechanical failure while our food was cooking and my tacos were cooked already so they were sitting by a heating lamp while the rest of my colleagues food was prepared.  Food was cold and tasteless. Customer service was terrible. To top it off, we all had to ""check ourselves out"" by paying in a device (where we each had to find our order).  Do not recommend. There are way better lunch options in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14
Shawn B.,"Landover, MD",539,68,115,2.0,11/3/2015,"Chili's forgot to add flavor!!! After deciding to head here for lunch, I was quickly turned off. The service was good. Brittani was the waitress. She was nice and accommodating. I ordered the lunch size chicken fajitas. It tasted like I ordered bread and flesh. This was some ""gamey"" tasting chicken. I feel as though this chicken resided near the Potomac River and was recently murdered before coming to my lunch plate. It certainly missed the kitchen to receive any spice or savory seasoning. Absent, the great customer service, I'd likely not come back. Perhaps, it was an off day. I typically like Chili's. Hopefully, next time will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14

Our server was unpleasant and everything came out on a delay. If that was the worse of it all would've been well. The appetizer came out without plates. We waited a while for them while our food got cold then when we got them, the plates weren't clean. I got my wine and it had fingerprints all over the glass and food residue was next to the rim left over from someone else's lips! Then the food came and the rim of every plate was atrocious with dirty smudges and water marks. I was so grossed out. The manager claimed she will have a meeting with her employees about cleaning the dishes. This is unacceptable. I will NEVER go to this location again and from the reviews I see they should be shut down. Disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14

Samantha G.,"Chicago, IL",1090,1717,2677,2.0,6/20/2012,"So my mom gave me a Chili's gift card for Xmas like 2 years ago. And the BF and I were in Crystal City last weekend and trying to eat on the cheap. So that is how we wound up here - aiming for a bite to eat that would not go over $15 (the value of the gift card). The overall problem with Chili's is that they don't have good food. Seriously, the skillet queso is like the only worthy thing on their menu. Ok, maybe that's a tad harsh. It ain't all bad. But it's not exactly quality food either. The problem with this particular Chili's is the lack of service. And I do mean a serious lack of service. We sat at our table for at least 10 minutes before anyone came over. Our drinks were slow to arrive. Our food was very fast to arrive. We were checked on just once, which was immediately after our food arrived. Our check had to be flagged down. Sure, I've experienced worse. But meh, it shouldn't have been that lacking.

I'm usually seated pretty quickly as I opt for the bar area.  Speaking of which, I can recall sitting in one of the booths once and the bar tender was pretty much our server too.  Bear in mind that this was during lunch time and the bar wasn't exactly crowded.  There were some ladies at the bar who were being over-flirtatious, probably trying to get free drinks :-/  Whatever they were doing was working because it was like pulling teeth to get his attention for a re-fill!  Pitiful.  My coworkers and I were so frustrated that we just asked for the check and left...refill-less!
