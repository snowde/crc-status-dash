Suzie C.,"Palm Harbor, Tampa Bay, FL",1,1026,196,4.0,9/16/2017,"Stopped in for lunch. We sat in the bar area which has high tops and booths along with the bar top. We were greeted immediately and we ordered 2 waters. We then ordered off of their lunch menu. He had the fajitas which consisted of 3 shells and the fixin's plus chicken. Sour cream, salsa and lettuce on the side. I ordered the tacos which were really really good. We both had a soup, one enchilada and one southwest. My enchilada was absolutely delish. The southwest was also very good but of the two I would order the enchilada again, for sure.  The one thing that was a bit annoying was the waitress. She was nice enough but she was LOUD. As in, I can hear your entire conversation with every other customer in the building. Why SO LOUD!!! Shhhhh.  We would return again. The police officers were eating here and when you see them eating at a place it is usually legit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Jen S.,"Weaverville, NC",5,121,,1.0,6/15/2017,"Ok, I've been to Chilis 4567 times but the past 2 times I've been to this particular location  (ordering 2 different dishes) I have left w a terrible pain in my stomach, Feeling nausuaus and like I was going to vomit.  I went home after my most recent visit, thinking I was going to be spending my evening in the bathroom.. nope.  Just felt terrible most of the evening!!   I won't visit this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Vicky J.,"Leicester, NC",0,26,19,2.0,4/23/2017,"This is the only chilis in our town.  They do offer many menu items that are tasty.  The only thing I can say That they are consistent about, is getting our order wrong.  This has happened on my last 3 visits.  I did not have a big order and no special requests.  This time I had ordered the sampler platter appetizer.  The sauce on the chicken was wrong.  I mentioned it to the waiter and he stayed that was directly his fault.  Most restaurants would just bring you the corrected item.  This waiter made sure he took the wrong item off the plate first before he brought us the corrected item.  Makes me wonder what he did with the other boneless chicken wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Russ L.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,1.0,1/27/2017,The salad was sub par. Cold shrimp. More importantly there is not a veteran's discount. Most eating establishments pay homage to our hallowed brothers. Chili's is unamerican and unappreciative of the sacrifice made by our most honorable of citizens.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Super F.,"Saint Augustine, FL",36,30,132,4.0,11/4/2015,"Consistently satisfied. Chilis is a chain and you pretty much know what you are getting. But, what makes this one special is that the service is consistently good. The people are friendly and they strive to get your order right the first time and fix it immediately if they don't. The food is always hot and tasty. This is a safe bet for travelers, or families with picky eaters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Annlee V.,"Asheville, NC",2,12,,2.0,12/21/2016,"I ordered one fajita with grill steak and was charged an extra $2.00 instead of the $1.00 listed on the menu.  The server told me that $1.00 covers one portion of the steak but the kitchen puts two portions on the fajitas.  The menu should say $2.00.  I did not ask for two portions of fajitas.  It is not the dollar, its being ripped off that is wrong.  I contacted their customer service and was surprised at the lack of interest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Nicole H.,"Asheville, NC",0,14,,1.0,2/16/2017,"This use to be my favorite restaurant.  I would stopped by at least once a week.  It's really gone down hill.  I go back hoping they've improved and I really want them to get their standards back up.  They keep changing the menu, but it's the food quality that they need to improve upon.  I took my family out and it took over 30 minutes for my family to get their entrees.  I don't order the skillet queso any more, when I get it, it's either runny or cold.  My mother got her entrée which was cold, they didn't cook my nephew's steak right, and I got my chicken crispers 45 minutes after ordering.  Will be my last visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Manuel M.,"Asheville, NC",154,75,103,3.0,4/4/2015,Your average chili's chain. But I do like the new menu. Our servers are super attentive and friendly. Good food. But I find it interesting that each table has its own game kiosk so if you are bored you can spend money to play games. Whatever happened to conversing with those you are out to eat with?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Matthew B.,"Marion, NC",23,70,3,5.0,4/22/2015,"Really impressed with this location as of lately. I have visited several times over the past month as I have been wanting to try something different outside of my normal stops. This location in particular has never disappointed me. Drinks always filled, and staff is always friendly and happy to be there it seems. This is how restaurants should be ran. Food is always good, and hot. Exactly the way it should be. Definitely worth a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Mikee R.,"Murphy, NC",88,973,97,1.0,4/11/2013,"The one most important thing that deserves them one star; There are no towel dispensers in the bathroom. This means all of the people who didn't wash their hands touched the door. I have nothing to grab the door handle with to open it. Now I have everyone else's germs on my hands before I eat.  This is unacceptable. Because people see the hand blowers and decide not to wash their hands and this Chili's promotes it. Disgusting! This Chili's had the worst service I have seen in a long time. The person greeting the front door was also our waitress. We saw her three times, when she seated us, when the took our order and when she brought our bill. We gave a three dollar tip for each time she graced us with her presents. The food was prepared perfectly. So good job to the cook who was working. I am sure the management will chase them off soon.  Low standards is what this Chili's strives for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Matt B.,"Snohomish, WA",36,396,16,3.0,8/31/2012,"It's a Chili's. If you come here, you know exactly what you're getting, since it's the same experience everywhere you go.  Cool thing and pro-tip: If you check in here on Foursquare, you get a free chips-and-salsa appetizer. I was about ready to devour the booth when I sat down, so that was very welcome. The burger I had was good. The service was decent. My iced tea didn't have ice in, so Alanis Morissette penned a song about that. It was a safe dinner, which is exactly what I was looking for after a long drive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
Chrystal L.,"Canton, NC",0,6,,4.0,12/29/2013,"Great for late night or lunch. The servers are always friendly and the food is usually good. I love the margarita grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I usually get the shrimp side as well. It is too much to eat in one sitting, but the seasoning on the shrimp is unique and in my opinion makes the meal. I am also a fan of the strawberry lemonade (not too sweet) and molten chocolate cake (of all the restaurants that serve this type of dessert, Chili's does it best). I had a bad experience once involving take-out, but I was very impressed with the follow-up customer service I received from the manger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asheville
