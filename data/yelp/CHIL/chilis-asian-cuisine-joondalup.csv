Happy P.,Australia,18,489,412,3.0,1/11/2012,"One of my favourite food is Asian, I love the different spices and they have such a variety of foods so I can try something different each time and still find something that sounds delicious. Chili's is no exception, the food is great every time and pretty cheap too which keeps a smile on my face! It is really quiet in there but don't let that put you off it is really decent food for a really decent price!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asian-cuisine-joondalup
Bianca B.,Australia,10,221,50,3.0,12/27/2011,"This place always seems to be quiet- which surprises me immensely. Cheap and decent Asian food. What else do people want? I guess it is competing with Kulcha which is about 5 minutes away, but personally, Â I like the food better at Chili's sometimes. There is something of a mass-production feel at Kulcha. They are churning out hundreds of plates a night at lightning speed that you start to feel like a statistic. Not at chili's. We've been there a few times but honestly we get a bit put off because of how quiet it has been. Which is sad. So if you need a decent, cheap feed, get down to Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-asian-cuisine-joondalup
