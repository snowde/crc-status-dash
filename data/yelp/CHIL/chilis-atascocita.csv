Shelly P.,"Atascocita, TX",0,3,,5.0,9/20/2017,Excellent service tonight & great food! Atmosphere was great! Had a little one and waiter was very attentive to him! Ranchero tacos were fresh & filling. Kids grilled cheese & mandarin oranges were yummy & he loved the Blue Fizz drink!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Gaby C.,"Houston, TX",18,17,3,1.0,7/11/2017,"We have gotten to the restaurant about 10:15 on a Tuesday night. We were trying to set at the bar a very rude guy full of tattoos told us that ""Are have been close "" well I just come in.. not that I have been there all night too know that. Them they have sent us to the restaurant are.  Another rude guys with a big beard was trying to get our drinks very rude.. until I have asked him if he was in a bad mood?? He has responded that he not supposed to be there . So , That is not my fault....  you are getting  pay to do your job..  finally a very  nice waitress come in our rescue.  Let just mention that we were celebrating my sister wedding anniversary and the first time that my nephew come to visit me..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Danielle L.,"Coldspring, TX",0,28,23,1.0,7/24/2017,First of all this place smells like a Mc'Donalds playground room. The food is horrible and I will never waste money here ever again. Very nasty place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
James F.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,3,,5.0,1/13/2017,Returned today after getting our previous problem worked out with new General Manager Matt. Totally different atmosphere!!  Our server Melissa was excellent along with her teammate.  The food was hot and tasty. It's obvious that big changes have been made to this location since September. They go from 0 stars to a 5 star experience for us Matt addressed the original problem in a timely fashion even reaching out by phone to speak directly to me. The assistant manager who came to the table today was very pleasant as well and knows her job well. Great customer interaction and service also.  Overall night and day experience from September.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Melissa J.,"Humble, TX",38,25,2,1.0,7/7/2017,Was seated very quickly for a Friday night. However we sat there for 15 minutes waiting to get our drink order. The damn manager even walked by at least 10 times. No one even stopped us as we walked out the door! Unbelievable!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Garrett T.,"Westchase, Houston, TX",38,1,,1.0,4/29/2017,Worst lunch at any restaurant I have ever been too.  They have items showing on the menu.  The chicken I ordered was look warm.  Manager did not care at all about my complaints will never ever come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Dana P.,"Kingwood, TX",14,7,26,2.0,12/2/2016,I am not really sure how you run out of food at a restaurant. This location of Chili's is the only restaurant this has ever happened to me with main dishes. I don't know if I just have bad luck? Last time we ordered they were out of the Dr Pepper ribs my husband ordered and then also out of the beer ribs we tried to order in their place. This time tonight they were out of pork carnitas for the fajita combo and then the most surprising thing they were out of...Southwest Egg rolls! I mean come guys it's Friday night. It's just odd to not have core menu items going into the weekend and again something that I have never seen at a chain restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Barry P.,"Humble, TX",0,2,,1.0,4/7/2017,"This was a sad Friday night. Food cost more but it taste less. Old, cold food and just everything was a horrible sitcom. I never complain but asked for the manager this time. The manager couldn't have been over 22 years of age. He offered to take off one item, which was a joke. Old, refried or re-microwaved junk. We were regulars but this was it for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita

Sara W.,"Spring, TX",4,24,2,1.0,7/3/2016,"Not the best experience at this location tonight. They were super slow and we were at the restaurant 1 hour 45 mins. The new sunrise burger came highly recommended by our server, after waiting a while for our food everything came except this burger. Apparently it was burnt and being remade. New burger comes and egg not cooked as requested (over medium) and completely missing the bacon (a highlight when originally told to order this). Several mins later, as everyone else was almost done eating, bacon was brought out The table across from us sat and received drinks but was not checked on or asked for their order for quite a while (we placed order, appetizer came, and ate all of our chips and salsa before they ordered). Another table remained dirty almost our entire dining experience.....what could the staff be doing on such a slow night???",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Kirsty K.,"Humble, TX",0,8,61,5.0,1/8/2017,"2nd time in Chillis and yet again the standout was service. We waited for a table and when seated waited for service - all was explained by Steven/Stephen (new staff and lack of communication). He was, without a doubt, one of the best that I've had the pleasure to meet since moving from the U.K. - efficient, attentive and personable. We have 2 kids and a toddler and he placed his chair perfectly and moved my bag in the process (usually a seat is dumped next to us). We don't eat out often, since having a baby even less, but with service like Steven's/Stephen's it reminded me of why we decided to move. The food was good but the service was commendable!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Renee M.,"Humble, TX",28,1,,1.0,6/27/2017,After a long day at work ordered curbside. They said it would be ready at 6:25 pulled up at 6:15. Young lady came out with the bag and told us to have a good day.  Before pulling off I decided to check the order and it was incorrect. I went back inside and waited. The same young lady came towards me with a box in her hand and said oh I'm sorry this is yours. We traded the incorrect items and we headed home with our food. Kind of defeated the curbside pickup. However once we got home the food was old and cold. My husband had ordered the ribs and I ordered some new item that had smoked sausage. The sausage was cold and very greasy and the ribs my husband ordered we're also cold. I paid an extra 3.25 for a side salad and the lettuce was brown. Even our drinks were flat! I live at best five minutes from the Chili's in Atascocita. It just seems like over the years their service is failing. Lots of employees standing around and not much work getting done. Nearly $40 spent and so not worth it!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Karen F.,"Houston, TX",1,1,,1.0,12/14/2016,"Very disappointed. My iced tea was never refilled and I never got any ice. It took at least 15 minutes to get the dessert. I ordered chipotle wings but received chicken tenders instead (they were overcooked). To rectify it I was brought a bowl of chipotle Bbq sauce.  Overall the service, the food, and overall atmosphere was pathetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Crystal T.,"Humble, TX",22,112,93,5.0,3/6/2015,"Much, much better than the old Chili's! Everyone in our party was pleased with their order and the food came to the table in good time. New atmosphere is cool! After avoiding Chili's two years, we're happy about the changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Marc S.,"Humble, TX",149,107,592,2.0,10/11/2014,"If you're reading this, you've probably been to a Chili's in your lifetime. You've probably ordered their 2 for $20 special and you probably enjoyed it and probably went home satisfied. Waiting for the food here is dumb though. Way too long for a small group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
ChelleBelle V.,"Houston, TX",7,58,151,4.0,8/15/2014,The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because the bathroom was a mess and although toilet paper was all over the floor the rolls were empty in the stalls. Bathrooms are VERY important to families!!!  The food and service was perfect!! Our drinks were filled promptly and our order was served hot n fresh.  My daughter had the lunch special that included a soup & main dish. She chose the baked potato soup which I tasted and it is so creamy and good!! Then she had the fresh mex salad that she loved. She had it with the chipotle grilled chicken and it was so fresh and full of flavor. I opted foe the side salad and avocado bacon chicken sandwich. It comes on a pretzel bun but I asked for the wheat Texas toast and it was YUMMY! The tx toast actually tasted homemade with a kittle honey wheat flavor. I'm loving their new menu. For a chain restaurant they have a good menu going and we will be back sooner than later.  Our server was great and we arrived just as they opened so there was no wait. Disappointed that they still allow smoking but fortunately no smokers had arrived during our time there. We do avoid going there for dinner just for that reason though.  Thanks for the great meal!

Alayka R.,"Humble, TX",1,14,7,1.0,1/8/2016,"I moved to the area a few years ago, I first had Chili's a far ways from here (Germany) and it was my favorite restaurant. Now, after the renovation and I guess new management the quality of food, service, and cleanliness dropped... We went here after the renovations finished and we did the 2/$20. He got the steak and asked for medium-rare and it came out rare. It came back a second time and was still rare.  Then we went again, gave it a chance and same thing happened. So now, we don't go there anymore we avoid it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita
Karla M.,"Houston, TX",65,18,14,1.0,12/27/2015,The waiter was super sweet but we got two dirty dishes and that made me lose my appetite.

Charlene T.,"Humble, TX",38,14,10,1.0,1/31/2016,"Placed order for 2 meals (burger and Caribbean shrimp salad), it took 50 minutes to get order, and it was not busy.  When salad came, the shrimp was covered in Cajun spices and very spicy.  Asked waitress to remove the salad due to the spices and take off the ticket.  She send the manager over to address the issue, and she was extremely rude.

Kyle Z.,"Fargo, ND",0,11,6,3.0,7/4/2014,"Food was excellent. We got boneless buffalo  wings as an appetizer, and I got the cajun chicken pasta. The problem we had at this chilis was the service. Took the lady forever to give us refills when we asked her and she completely forgot to give us silverware. When she finally got around to it she almost gave us dirty utensils, too. Easily would have been four or five stars if the waitress hadn't sucked.  Tl;dr Food was very good, service not so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=40
Mel E.,"Houston, TX",330,345,1380,1.0,4/2/2015,"I don't mind going to chain restaurants like Chili's because their food is decent but what sticks out from each restaurant from the other is their service and I've gone to this Chili's numerous times (I still don't know why) and have always been disappointed with the service and whole experience. Once you enter the restaurant, the hostess or host rarely are welcoming, they don't look at you or when they do see you enter they don't even greet you and say... ""this way"". It's fast to get our orders taken, I give them that, but to even get appetizers or the main meals out, it just takes too long, like 30 minutes long or longer. I've gone to the other Chili's around Humble and it's never that long. The waiter would keep coming back to apologize that it should be right out about 3 times in one visit. I've been going to this Chili's location for a while now and it just doesn't seem to be cutting it. I continue to give chances to this place because my friends end wanting to eat here but I think I'll just probably opt out next time because it's pretty disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=40

Nice P.,"Houston, TX",0,12,,1.0,6/24/2016,We used to love this Chilis.  The customer service has gone way down.  The management does not seem to care about customers.  The food is average at best.  Never thought I would say I prefer Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=40
Dwayna E.,"Crosby, TX",27,2,,1.0,12/14/2016,"I am not really sure what has gone wrong, but something is not correct at this location.  I used to dine in the bar area monthly without any problems, but the service & quality is no longer up to par for a paying patron.  I and 4 others visited the restaurant last night (sat in normal dining area, not bar).  One order took over an hour and had to be changed to carry out for friend who was now late picking up folks at the airport.  The other food took over an hour and the salads were soggy.  It was as if they had been sitting waiting on sliders.  Ordered frozen margaritas.  Tasted funny and was like a kid slushee.  Had to exchange for on the rocks..better, but mix being used now is not very good.  The only good thing about the entire visit was the server.  But great concern as he had to continually apologize for everything that was going wrong.  Concerned on how many people probably do not tip accordingly to the servers, holding them accountable for the total dining experience, though they are just a buffer.  Based on the recent reviews, this restaurant is in serious trouble.  If I had read the reviews on yelp first, I would not have considered this as an option to dine with friends. I am hopeful this restaurant will get back on track with staffing levels and improvement on quality of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=40
Nicole K.,"Humble, TX",0,2,,3.0,4/8/2015,"Normally the service is ok and the food acceptable, but tonight was a different story. 2 out of 3 of our orders were incorrect. My medium rare steak was black and my husband's turkey burger also burnt to a crisp. I had them redo my steak and to my dismay the steak came out with the avocado slices and drizzle on top (I hate avocado but ordered it originally on the side for my hubby). The manager was short with us and not willing to work with our poor server who did absolutely nothing wrong! Only my husband's meal was taken off the bill. I will be back but I suggest they hire a competent manager who doesn't allow burnt and overcooked food to be acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=40

Xavier P.,"Humble, TX",3,11,,1.0,3/14/2015,"The recent building renovation does nothing for the poor cleanliness inside and neither does it help the poor service. Went there last night and immediately noticed a noticeably dirty entry mat. While waiting for a table also noticed garbage all over the floor. When we got to our table the booth bench was wet. The waitress said it's because it was recently wiped clean. Yuck. Hoping to get a dry seat I looked over to the adjacent table but that one still had food and spills from other patrons. I thought to myself ""if this is how they take care of the premises, I wonder how they must take care of the food"". We then walked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=40
K F.,"Humble, TX",29,153,55,3.0,8/21/2014,"Typical family restaurant, nothing new to see here.

Jada M.,"Humble, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/18/2016,"Third time I have been to this location and every time the service sucks. There is definitely some lack of training here. 1. We sat at the long table in the bar area that still was dirty and had a few dirty dishes on it. We were told we could sit there and someone would come clean it. Well 30 minutes later they are still there and we still haven't seen a server. 2. They  bring my drink in a dirty glass and I asked for lemon and lime for my water 3x. 3. They bring out 2 appetizers (approximately 10 minutes apart and we ordered at the same time) for 5 ppl at a table and no plates or napkins. Again I'm asking for basic things that waiters should bring to your table. 4. Finally we get our food and yep you guessed it, it was cold. I'm just done with this place by now.

Todd F.,"Houston, TX",1,53,90,2.0,6/1/2014,"The expediter was portioning fries with a basket and every now and then picking a fry up with her hands to even out portion sizes. This would not have been an issue but she was not wearing gloves and was also seen handling dishes and scrapping debris off of them with her nails and picking her pen off of the floor after it dropped. I also saw other employees scrape food off of eating utensils before placing on serving plates. The person putting the orders together burned his hand while opening a bag of food before shaking it into the ""to go"" box. Yes, he cursed and no, he was not wearing gloves after also handling the money from his till. I did not observe any of the servers or expediter wearing a hair net. All of this was observed standing at the ""to go"" counter. Needless to say that this coupled with the stagnant sickening smell of old smoke and beer means that I will not be back.

Sat at the bar because it's always easier and faster (and in this case it was). However be aware that this Chili's is in Humble and therefore smoking is allowed in the bar. I had forgotten that there are places that still have smoking inside (a little behind the times for what is supposed to be a 'family' restaurant. Oh well. As for the food. I tried something different this time and got the 6 oz sirloin. The beef itself was okay, cooked exactly the way that I asked. The problem was that it arrived with a garlic spread on top. The menu mentioned nothing of garlic, just mentioned a butter spread. I scrapped it off and ate the steak, but I think the garlic was an inappropriate topping. It just tasted weird. The mashed potatoes were very bland as well. From now on I'll stick to the chicken pasta which I usually get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=40

The buffalo sauce had been cooked into the batter and it looked like a fried Snickers from the carnival. WTF?! I despise stupid cooks who just don't give a damn!  The only reason Chili's get 4 stars is because...well, it's Chili's and every experience hasn't been like this. Also, the server (whom I believe was also a manager or something) was pretty attentive and made it easy to get the order corrected, BUT seemed clueless on the fact that the chicken should been changes out, too.

WEEEELLLLL, we get inside and 1/3 to 1/2 of the tables are empty.  The four people in front of us talk the the hostess and she tells them to wait.  Huh?  Then we say ""Two please"" and she says ""It will be 15 to 20 minutes.""  I give her the look that says ""Say whaaat?""  She says ""Oh, the kitchen is really backed up.""  Um, your place is about half full.  So hub and I say, ""Not only no, but heck no.""  What the heck?  This is not the only weirdness we have experienced here so that's it.  We're done with you, crazy American family fun chain location.  Butt-plug (see my earlier review for that reference).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=20
John S.,"Humble, TX",30,1,,1.0,11/10/2015,Atascocita chilis is the worst service of any place I have ever been in my life. They need to close the place down the management obviously does not care about Service to his customers. I cannot rate the food because the last three times I've been here after 30 minute wait I'm not even getting my drinks I've not been able to taste the food. Go away make room for something else better,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=20
Diane N.,"Porter, TX",19,27,,1.0,12/5/2015,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. Went there for my Hubby's birthday celebration. Our party Had 11 people. We were there for 20 minutes before getting drinks. Food came out sporadically, so basically half of the guests were finished eating before the rest of the people had food. I never got my order after 1.5 hours of being at the restaurant. Beware! Eat at the Chilis near 59 instead of this one!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=20
Joey H.,"Humble, TX",0,34,,2.0,10/26/2015,"The food is typical for Chili's - okay and the menu is kind of all over the place.  What distinguishes this from other Chili's is the terrible wait service.  I've been there four times and it seems to get worse each time.  Tonight was the last time -  we went in around six with our five year old son, and the place was just over half full.  We were seated quickly and then waited fifteen minutes for our waitress.  The waitress seemed to be deliberately ignoring us and we finally said something to the hostess about how she hadn't even bothered to say ""hi"" or take our drink order after being there 20 minutes.  The hostess assured us the waitress would be over in just a couple of minutes.  8 minutes later, we were still sitting at the table with no drinks and a fussy kid.  A family of nine or more came in and sat down, and the waitress immediately went over and took their orders while looking at us like ""ha, look what I just did"".  Anyway, we immediately left after letting one of the manager's know what happened.  I don't particularly like giving bad reviews, but this Chili's has truly earned it.  Part of me thinks they deserve one star, but their food, while not great, is pretty consistent with other chili's. Don't just take my word on this, read the other reviews...;BAD BAD SERVICE    NOTE - went back seven months later and the service was much better so I bumped it up one star 5-8-17 - Took that star back.  Recently went back to Chili's and they no longer have chicken fried steak or gravy to go with any of their sides.  The last time I went there, some people in the back of the restaurant (employees working in the back), got into an argument and started yelling at each other -  everyone in the restaurant could hear it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=20

Katherine K.,"Channelview, TX",24,10,1,1.0,8/2/2015,I'll never go back to this chilis ever again... The food was horrible! My boneless wings were hard and the new onion rings suck! The only thing good was the southwestern Mac and cheese! The coke was horrible the dr pepper didn't taste much better! My bf ordered a margarita and when I seen it I was like that looks like crap and well he said it taste like crap too! Ended up paying way to much for food that was horrible! I should have went to lupe tortilla or something and got better food for the same price!!!!! I am now paying the price I have gotten sick to my stomach 2 times!

Stan A.,"Houston, TX",0,23,,3.0,7/31/2015,"Not sure what is going on at this location service wise, but they are about to lose a long time customer. The food was good as always, but the last three trips have delivered bad service. The waitress this time was very polite, but didn't have it together. When we sat down, our drinks came right away, but no silverware or napkins. We finally asked for napkins thinking she would notice no silverware, nope. When our food arrived, we still had no silverware & had to ask for it & ketchup for the fries. We got the silverware but after 10 minutes had to make a second request for ketchup. It finally came, but was nearly empty. I am not blaming the waitress, this is a poor management issue, especially since service has been poor the last three trips. Not good Chilis, get it together & train your workers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=20
Xander A.,"Humble, TX",39,4,1,3.0,4/27/2015,"The food here is dependibly good.  However they seem to be having problems with the service at this location.  Again today, we had to wait over 10 minutes before any waitstaff came by.  I had to go back to the hostess and ask if we were going to be waited on.  So, the hostess took our drink order, then a waiter appeared a minute later to again take our drink order and explain that our table was at the edge of someone's station and no one was sure who was responsible for us.  Then a waitress showed up to actually take our food order.  I asked her if anyone else would be joining us.  After that things went smoothly. I did overhear the manager apologizing to the table behind us about their food.  Not a good thing to hear On several occasions now we have had to wait to be seated while the restaurant was barely one third full.  This location is developing some problems that need to be addressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=20
Christy P.,"Houston, TX",40,46,2,1.0,5/30/2016,"I wish I had checked Yelp before dining here. We just had a terrible experience. Walked in and they weren't even that busy. Waited to be seated. Finally seated 5 minutes later. Only to wait another 15 minutes for someone to finally come check on us. At this point we should of walked out because already the service was so bad (non-existent) but we stayed. I ordered a grilled chicken salad which was tasteless and the chicken was barely cooked and cold. I hope I don't get sick. My husband's meal was brought out incorrectly, too. We got mis-charged on the receipt. We will not be back. I wouldn't recommend this Chili's location to anyone which is a shame since it's a brand new restaurant. Customer service is everything, people. Maybe they'll get it together one day. Update: My husband was violently ill after eating here. They definitely gave him a horrible bout of food poisoning. Save yourself and don't DINE at this awful Chili's... there are plenty of other great places to try in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=20

Eileen A.,"Westland, MI",42,148,147,3.0,6/2/2014,"It's Chili's. The food was good. I ordered the new mex bowl. It was filled with rice, corn, black beans, chicken, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, tortilla strips, avocado slices (2). The portion size was just right. My mom was with me and ordered the black bean burger. She said it was good and didn't leave you feeling extra full.  We waited a LONG time just to be sat. 2 ladies were before Us also said they had been waiting a long time as well. Service was ok. The waitress was very nice.  Lots of tables were dirty. I'd probably return only for convince or a craving. They have smoking in the bar area which is right by the entrance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=20
Todd R.,"Kingwood, Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/31/2015,"Horrible service and customer etiquette.  Went in an hour before closing.  They had closed all sections but one.  We requested a table and none were available so a waitress l sat us in a different section. Waiter called her out across the restaurant and she said we needed a table and he got angry... Across the restaurant.  My wife is injured with a leg and shoulder and couldn't manage a booth.  A table was necessity not preference.  After that, service was sub-standard as  the waitress (different than the one that seated us) only returned to deliver food and then the check.  Drinks sat empty most of the visit.  Chips were greasy, chewy and not edible.  Manager on staff, Trey, was too busy making jokes with his staff to notice or care and actually seemed to condone their behavior towards ""the customers in the wrong section"".  Would hate to think this is how they might treat someone permanently disabled!  Do not visit this location.  Go to the one on 59! Would give zero stars if I could.  Probably the worst experience to date at a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=60
Alvin M.,"Humble, TX",0,6,,1.0,1/26/2013,"I don't know, but tonight was a weird service we got from this waiter. Got our drinks; then we have to wait awhile to get anything else. I have to ask for the chips just to get us started.  Then had our food but we  have to wait a long time again to get drink refills. Not one time that this waiter(Ben) ask us about how we're doing or at least check on us. Then we are just in the middle of our food already he's asking us if we want dessert. To top it off ; we usually get an itemized receipt but he didn't give it to us. Bottom line BAD SERVICE from him. In fairness; the other waiters in the past were great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=60
Beth P.,"Houston, TX",0,52,,1.0,7/14/2014,"I'm shocked that Chili's allows smoking in its restaurants.  We walked in and were overwhelmed by the smoke smell.  We promptly turned around and left.  I called Chili's corporate and they were unapologetic, and indicated that this location had a faulty ventilation system.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=60

Michele W.,"Humble, TX",162,60,10,3.0,8/16/2011,"This was our first visit to this Chili's. The food was pretty good but the service was lacking. My daughter wanted a hot cocoa but was told they don't have it, but on the kid's menu they offer chocolate milk. Guess they can't warm up the chocolate milk. I was never asked if I wanted a refill on my soda. The table next to us was having issues with their service with the same server (Jared). I have never been a server but do respect them in their job and I know it's not an easy job. I just feel that you have to at least act like you're enjoying yourself to be good at it.

Betsy F.,"Kingwood, TX",64,8,,1.0,6/12/2014,"Went to Chili's last Saturday, June 7th, for a late dinner. The first issue came when my buddy touched something on the tabletop computer/monitor/game thing, at which time it thanked him for his purchase. He had no idea he was buying something as the screen didn't note any sort of price, or even confirm you want to purchase whatever it is..nope, just a big thank you!  We immediately told our server who said the manager would come talk with us. He never did. We decided to share an order of Chicken & Shrimp Fajitas. When then arrived, the chicken looked microwaved & the shrimp were not pink & looked totally undercooked..it IS Chili's Bar & GRILL, right? One would expect the fajitas to look, well, grilled! After sending the order back, we received another order that looked exactly the same as the first. We ate very little of the meal, got the bill & wouldn't you know it, an extra $.99 was charged for the ""purchase"" made by my friend. Makes me wonder how many folks end up with the same charge, due to touching the screen not realizing they're on the hook for $.99 or of course a child does it...many probably never even catch the extra charge on the bill! That's one heck of a racket the have going!  At this point, I had enough of this place, vowing never to return. If you dare go, just remember not to touch that little TV thing on the table...they'll getcha!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-atascocita?start=60
