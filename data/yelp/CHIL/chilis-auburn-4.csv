Helena O.,"Worcester, MA",124,76,158,3.0,11/21/2017,"I mean, it's Chili's....the food isn't great but the customer service was on point so they got three stars. We started with drinks, we decided on margaritas. I got the triple berry and my friend got the blueberry and pineapple flavor. Our drinks were really good. We ordered two rounds. We decided to get apps before deciding on our meals and we got an order of honey chipotle wings. As I was cutting into my wings I saw a black something....I wasn't sure what it was, but it wasn't a part of the honey chipotle or the white meat chicken....so I asked our server about it and she took it back to the kitchen as she was also unable to confirm what it was. Minutes later the manager came out apologizing and explained that the black thing on my plate was apparently from a piece of spinach from the southwestern egg rolls that has been burnt. Okay, no problem. That was really nice of him and he was extremely pleasant. For dinner my friend got the bacon avocado grilled chicken sandwich (which she said was not that grilled) and I got the Cajun shrimp pasta. We decided both were ""alright"" but not great. My Cajun shrimp pasta tasted exactly like the description. It's almost like everything was thrown together so it didn't have a savory taste, it had a ""throw together"" taste. If you cook, you know what I mean. The ingredients just didn't marinate well. As for the burger, my friend didn't finish hers. When asked if she wanted to wrap it up (that's how much she had left) she politely declined. The food here is subpar, not the restaurants fault. It's a chain. It's to be expected. Overall the service was really great, which like I said made up for the mishap and mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
Sarah C.,"Worcester, MA",216,373,215,1.0,11/27/2017,We ordered takeout from here.  The only reason this gets a one star is the food that we did get was actually pretty good.   I drove about 15 minutes between back and forth to pick it up.  I get home and we are missing the rice and beans that make the fajitas a meal.  I call and they say to come back and they will get it for us.  I go ALL the way back and the manager gives me the food and says that he cancelled the charge for our food.  I asked him what he was going to do for my troubles and he said that he would just cancel the charge for our order and that he tripled checked that it was right this time. I take the bag to the car and check it for myself.  It was not right and it was actually more wrong this time than last!  Back in for a 3rd time... they finally corrected and he was like well you can keep the wrong one for your troubles... seriously... We definitely won't be back to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
C R.,"Charlton, MA",0,74,8,1.0,4/12/2017,"Apparently I'm a glutton for punishment. The waitress wasn't good... rushed us, left empty cups and plates (or incorrect items) on the table forever. Brought over an incorrect drink and when we told her she just said ""I think it's ____""... awkward silence... ""I think I switched two drinks""... well no shit Sherlock!! But her tone was as if she didn't understand why we'd mention it. Response should have been ""I'll be right back with that"" not stating the obvious and presenting no solution to the problem. The white queso did not come out as described in the menu as it was missing some toppings. Barely warm, some cheese (not the queso fresco) wasn't melted all the way. Bleh. Some of my chicken had a strange texture. The molten lava cake was dry but tasted good. Place was filthy too.  I'll avoid for another 6-8 months and veto this place next time someone suggests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
Lei Y.,"Southbridge, MA",3,11,12,5.0,9/13/2017,"After the renovation the place is much less crowded and seemed to be very welcoming. My waitress remembers me and my child. She asks about my family!

Dennis M.,"Worcester, MA",51,52,49,3.0,4/8/2017,Chili's has good food and drinks. My only gripe is the calorie counts on the menu--either take them off or find a way to encourage me to eat a healthy sandwich instead of a burrito that has less calories. You can have great food and lower calories. The calories on the menu dissuade me from getting what I really want. Can't a healthier version be made available?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
Joey T.,"Storrs, Mansfield, CT",0,35,1,3.0,7/4/2017,"Their food is pretty good. I like their boneless buffalo chicken and their fajitas. The service is occasionally good, but sometimes bad for to-go orders. They make me wait then tell me to go to the bar when I go to the to-go area and then go to the to-go area when I go to the bar. They either have poor staff or are understaffed because of corporate cutbacks or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4

Megan B.,"Auburn, MA",1,6,1,1.0,12/23/2016,"Walked in the other night about 9pm (they close at 11) and stood in the front waiting for someone to seat us for a good 5 minutes. The bar tender was well aware that we were there, but didn't come out to seat us or let another waitress know. The one waitress that did come out walked right by us and served another table. We turned around and left. Their food isn't even that good, we were just hungry for something quick and cheap. Went to T.G.I.

Dick B.,"Leicester, MA",0,4,,1.0,5/8/2016,Menu photos are a far cry from the reality that arrives on your plate. Fajita sides are not separated so guacamole goes liquid. But server was really great!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
April A.,"Paxton, MA",2,31,2,2.0,3/19/2016,"Service was good, our waitress was kind and accommodating. The food was bad. Everything tasted old  and like it was frozen, even the ""fresh"" Veggies. The guac was beyond bad. We started with regular guac and chips and the guac tasted like a mayonnaise paste with avocado. I can't describe it well. We asked our waitress if we could get the table side guacamole instead and she was very nice and said no problem. She made it right in front of us and it still tasted off. What kind of avocados do they use here?? They looked normal, but tasted really bad and just nothing like guacamole. The shrimp in my fajitas were way over cooked and rubbery. Just yuck. There are a few Mexican restaurants around and we will not be going back to Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
Brianna R.,"Shrewsbury, MA",210,11,,1.0,6/11/2016,"Went here today with my friend, waited over 10 minutes for a waiter to just come and ask for our drinks , ended up ordering our drinks and appetizer (all we got) and when I mentioned to our waiter we were gonna order everything at once, he was rude and not polite and just snapped back ""ya well I need to take the drinks first"" ok... Then our drinks came then food came .. Not a long wait (I'd hope not for an appetizer and two drinks) then we paid with a gift card.. He came back and made it seem like there was 6.80 left on the card.. We asked for a receipt with somewhere to put tip because we thought the money was still on card.. He says ok and another waitress comes out and explains we owe another $6.80. Horrible service, have had better service.. But tonight was AWFUL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
Jesse D.,"Caribou, ME",95,345,149,4.0,9/7/2015,"It's a chain restaurant so you know what you're going to get if you've been to any other Chili's.  Started coming here after the one in Shrewsbury closed. Food has always been good, the only slight exception was the all you can eat fajitas were a bit less quality than their normal fajitas. Love the tablets on the tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
D S.,"Sturbridge, MA",0,15,3,2.0,9/12/2016,"We went there on a Saturday night around 630 7. When we walked in 3 adults 1 toddler the hostess told us about a 25 minute wait or we could seat ourselves in the ""lounge."" We looked over to the dining room to see several tables empty (more than 5 that we could see) so we decided to wait along with a few other families. When we finally got our table we were placed next to the very noise kitchen when there was multiple tables in front of us empty? Maybe because we have a child? Then our waiter comes 5 minutes later to take our drinks. And shortly after that our food. The food took 25+ minutes to arrive when the place wasn't even busy! We all got burgers which were good. Even though We had to ask for my side of guacamole and ranch even when we placed the order. Then our waiter disappeared for our whole dinner. We finally get refills on our drinks when we're just about done. He filled the ice right to the top of the glass so barely any liquid. (Picture below) We then inform the waiter we are all done and want to pay the bill. So we grab the machine to pay with our card and we can't because it had the previous party's order on it. So we waited for about ten minutes and nothing. So we ask another waitress what's going on and she says I will get your waiter. Another 5 minutes after that she comes out with the paper bill meanwhile our waiter is no where to be found. We try to pay by card on the machine and it's still not up. So instead we just end up paying with cash so we didn't have to sit there for another 10 minutes to sign the receipt. We left and were not very happy with the service at all !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
P. J.,"Storrs, CT",0,23,,1.0,6/23/2016,"According to a study out of  Ohio State University, 60% of new restaurants do not make it past the first year, and 80% go under in five years.  Perhaps the managers of this dreadful Chili's could have a second career teaching managers of really terrible new restaurants how to stay in business.  They could have courses in how to prepare tasteless boring food, and they could offer a short course on how to make tiny limp salads. Start up restaurants could be taught how to manage cold and hot food offerings so they all arrive at the table at the same luke warm temperature. There could be a seminar on how to train  waitstaff in inappropriate manners, and maybe even offer a graduate seminar in creative new ways to be offensive to patrons.  Clearly this Chili's has mastered all these subjects, and yet they are still in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
April C.,"Milford, MA",18,82,82,2.0,12/20/2015,"The food was decent and service was okay. This restaurant now has payment kiosks at every table with no option to pay with cash. I've seen these at other places but they would always still bring a check and the kiosk was just another option. It would be nice if there was a cash option that would somehow let the server know we were ready to pay. We just left the cash out on the table until she noticed it. It was a leisure lunch so it wasn't a problem that she didn't come back for another 30 mins.We left around 2:00 pm ,so I was a bit surprised how dirty/messy the prep/server area was since they had only been open for 2 to 3 hours.  When entering and exiting the restroom you walk pass a prep/server area, the counter tops were cluttered and the floor had scattered had food on it, lettuce , fries etc.  Something I would expect to see after a busy Saturday night service.   I don't expect to be heading back to this place anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
Beto C.,"Oakland, CA",1,73,2,1.0,1/5/2016,"Wow. This exceeded my expectations of what a ""bad food experience"" could be. For starters, they didn't even have vegetables! When I asked the waitress the reason why, she said ""the distributor hadn't brought any"". Very strange for a chain as big as this. In addition, I ordered the chile mango chicken (I might have messed the name up) and OMG, the chicken tasted/felt a bit under cooked. Never in my life have I had such RUBBERY chicken. So strange! In fact, my stomach hurts as I type this....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4
Mary M.,"Southbridge, MA",26,39,5,2.0,4/11/2016,This place is okay. The kids menu is very limited and the pizza is like rubber my son would not even eat it the one thing they always get is burgers and they are always cooked well and good. Their food for the most part is average and service you are never guaranteed it's good sometimes and other times you are waiting 30 minutes to get your bill.

Karen M.,"Grafton, MA",0,1,,2.0,8/27/2016,"For 3 out of 4 of us, the food arrived very cold despite a minimal wait for it.

However, the last few times, it has gone done hill.  Despite the consistently good service provides, the quality of the food is sub par. It seems thrown together and doesn't resemble the descriptions provided on the menu.   I had to send my salad back because it wasn't even the correct one. Once it came back, it was missing pretty much all the ingredients.  The server was kind enough to take it off the menu but the chef clearly was sleeping behind the line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4?start=20
Rob G.,"Dudley, MA",18,3,,1.0,8/22/2016,"Had to send food back twice for being cold. Cook could not get it right so I ended up ordering something else. Waitress yelled to the cook"" You better make that perfect for table 71"" my table. His response ""fuck him"" . To top it off after 2 hour of getting home both my wife and myself got sick.

Sam T.,"Leicester, MA",1,17,14,3.0,3/6/2015,"I used to frequent this Chili's quite a bit when I had long breaks in between classes. It was a place to grab a quick, filling lunch then leave; the average time spent waiting to be seated, ordering, receiving the food, eating and paying the bill was around 45 minutes. Most days I was greeted and served by a woman named Robin who was enthusiastic and kind. She would remember me and the people I'd go with, and she would even go as far as to remember our orders! She is a wonderful waitress, and an even more fantastic person in general. Whenever I went I would always order the ribeye. I have to admit, I regret going there so often and spending so much money on a slab of steak (~$17) that was either a hit or miss when it came to 1) the quality of the steak: some days the steaks were marbled and juicy, some days it was plain old cardboard or 2) whether or not the steak was cooked the way I requested it: I like my steak rare and more often than not they would give it to me medium well. If I was unsatisfied with my steak they would happily take it back for me, but unfortunately it would take too long and the person I'm with would already be done by the time I receive my new steak. This Chili's offers free WiFi but it seems to only work in the central area of the restaurant towards the kitchen. If you're seated any further than the few booths close to where the waiters and waitresses leave to get your food then you probably won't have much luck. Overall this is a decent place to grab a quick bite to eat (during the lunch hours when they aren't swamped with customers) if they cook your food correctly. It is a bit expensive, but some days it's definitely worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4?start=20

The bacon and jalapeño were added after the cheese was melted, so they did not stick well. I would not get these again.  The chips and salsa was huge. It must of contained at least a half of a bag that you would buy in the store. The bacon ranch quasadilla was large and filled. Tasty. The Cajun chicken pasta was not spicy at all. The Alfredo sauce tasted like velvetta. Not cool or tasty. It was very bland. The oreo Molton explosion was awesome. It had an angel food type cake.

The thing is, it is located not only next to a Burger King and a joint KFC/Taco Bell, but also right across the street is a McDonald's and not even a mile away is a Ninety-Nine and an Outback Steakhouse. Competition always has to be close.  Anyway, I've been here on a few occasions and it is usually always good. I've been here for birthdays and just regular meals and it has always been good like mentioned. However, a note on the fries are they sometimes come out lukewarm. But if you enjoy free appetizers (Not warm, just tortilla chips and salsa typically.) I think you'll be okay.  This Chili's is the same as all the other restaurants, and, also like all chain restaurants, full bar and regular menu.  All in all, It's a fine choice in Auburn.

Howard C.,"Charlton, MA",0,3,,1.0,12/11/2013,"Let's see, where to begin. How about when we (an older couple) walked in and were seated next to a family with loud young kids celebrating one of the kids' birthday, even though the restaurant was 90% empty. The server arrived within 15 seconds after we sat down and asked if we were ready to order (the first of only two times in the whole experience she was prompt) before we had even picked up our menus. We said we needed more time, and she returned in another 15 seconds, when we were still basically opening the menus. Tried to order broccoli, which was on the menu but, we were informed, they don't actually have it anymore. I ordered an iced tea, which was warm enough that the ice melted on contact and was so bitter that it was impossible to drink. After ordering we waited for a long time to get our food because, as it turns out, the kitchen ""forgot a side,"" even though the meals come with two sides. So, we ate. Then the empty plates sat on the table for at least 10 minutes after we finished. Flagged several people down asking them to send over our server with the check. She finally arrived and told us that she had left the building to deliver an order to a hotel, and told her manager to send someone over to check on us. Needless to say, nobody ever did. The manager stopped by and took $8.00 off our $25.00 check, which included a $2.40 charge for a drink we never ordered! She also gave us some coupons for free nachos and salsa, which any real Mexican restaurant will give you for free anyway. Oh, and the bathroom had a very dirty toilet, along with a sign on the door that told diners to let them know if the bathroom was dirty. Not our job, but clearly not their job either. Needless to say, we left the coupons on the table as we have no intention of ever going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburn-4?start=40
