Jennie N.,"Houston, TX",85,6,18,4.0,7/15/2017,"I came here with a party of four and had to wait maybe 5 minutes until we were acknowledged by the host who was also running the to-go counter at the time. This was during lunch time so the wait was expected and understandable. Once attended to, we were quickly seated and taken care of accordingly!  We each ordered a lunch combo and the waiter remembered our order without taking any notes or anything which was pretty impressive! It took a little longer than usual for the soup to be served, but again, the restaurant was in a pretty busy lunch rush. Everything was hot and tasted great. The portion of fries were smaller than what's normally given at other locations I've visited, but other than that, everything was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20

John B.,"Austin, TX",36,134,78,2.0,5/1/2016,"I do not like writing negative reviews, but i need to report the bad and the good. At this  location it makes a difference where you sit.  I normally sit at the bar and James and crew take great care to make sure everything is great.  Tonight we sat at a booth for a light dinner - just an appetizer - and the reports and reviews of the poor   service were accurate.  When our appetizer and it was not as we ordered - and because of the food and allergy issues it had to be remade. B let's just say it was not handled in the most professional manner. I have learned, if I'm going to eat at this location, I just need to sit at the bar and James let take care of me.  Occasionally, the kitchen makes mistake, but James makes sure it is taken care of promptly and correctly",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20

Greg M.,"Round Rock, TX",0,15,,1.0,10/28/2016,"We had dinner October 27,2016 We had the 2 for $20 We both had the Fajita's and Carnitas  and before we even left the restaurant my cousin was in the restroom. I dropped her off at her home and had to rush myself to the restroom and it didn't stop til 10 am this morning. My cousin called me and told me she spoke to a Manager named Kim and kim said she would comp our meal for today. I was not in the mood to go back and try their food again. Well my cousin convinced me and we returned we even asked for Kim and she never came out... They did give us another free meal and dessert  which was nice... I had the chicken salad and did not finish the salad but did eat the chocolate dessert. One of the employees came out and stated she didnt know what the conversation with Kim  who never came out. They charged us for the Tea.  I couldn't careless if you charged me for the Tea but it would have been nice to speak to the Manager and talk about the ill food which has kept me in the restroom most of the evening and through out the night. I will not be returning the service was horrible and the food went through us.....  Thanks Kim for stopping by and talking with us about our meal and service.... Oh never mind she didnt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20
Gene D.,"Austin, TX",0,8,,3.0,4/24/2016,"I wish I could add a half star because my experience here was above average but not 4 stars. It's been over 20 years since I've eaten Chili's. I wanted to order the Awesome Blossom, but I've learned that calorie abyss is long gone. I'm not a a huge fan of big chain restaurants but not against eating at them once in a while. There was a lot to like here. The ambiance is decent. Inoffensive pop songs play at an ignorable volume while people can face each other and still watch two different TVs that are playing the same show, which is inaudible with closed captioning enabled. Our server, Melissa, was very pleasant, professional and attentive. It wasn't a busy night, but we didn't have to wait long for her if we needed something. The receipts have a handy ""Gratuity Guide"" that shows potential tip values at 15% and 18% if you're living in 1995 inflation rates/are a cheap asshole and 20% and 22% if you're a decent human being that understands and appreciates the rarity and the value of quality service from those who have very little incentive to provide it. Either you tip well in these instances or do everyone a favor and eat your beans at home straight out of the can, you cheap trash. The food was alright. I've had better strawberry lemonade, but it was pretty tasty. My friend ordered a steak, which was fine after salting. I ordered the chicken Cajun pasta. She seemed to enjoy hers, but mine was only okay. The meat was great, but the presentation was a bit lacking. The meat was sliced but still mostly in one piece and not really mixed together with the pasta. Not that big of a deal cutting it up and mixing it myself, but I feel like there wasn't nearly enough sauce. There was just enough to partially coat the penne, but I prefer my pasta to be swimming in rich, flavorful sauce. There are these little tablet game screens on every table that cost $2 if you have children that need to channel their annoying into. I guess it's more cost effective and lower maintenance than the restaurant arcades of yore, but really, if your kid needs these things, maybe not bring them. And people who bring babies who can't even eat there, why can't you just go to McDonald's if you can't afford a babysitter? Whyyyyyyyyyy? I visited the bathroom. Their toilet seems commercial grade, but the flow of the flush (or FOTF) was oddly weak. I pushed the handle a few times just to get a good spin going. It was like watching an hourglass with water instead of sand. There might be issues with this if you leave something sizable behind. The worst thing was a small issue. When we were seated, our table and seats were still damp from being wiped down. I sat on it, didn't feel it through my pants. Okay, it's just water or cleaning solution or whatever. No stains on my butt. But why couldn't someone use a towel or something? Overall, good, not great, but a convenient walk if you're staying at the Econolodge nearby and enough distractions to keep your unruly children complacent enough for you to forget about your joyless marriage, if only for an hour or so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20
Grace L.,"Austin, TX",151,218,1543,4.0,8/15/2015,Wanted some wings on Mother's Day but everywhere was packed so crashed here later at night but glad we did. Kiddoes were hungry and I have always loved their Mushroom Swiss Burger. It was fun. Sat behind some prom people and still had a near 45min wait but not sure why when the restaurant was half empty :/ But its ok. HAd time to bond w/the kids. It was still yummy. The jalapeno onion rings were a hit! Our older two shared the 2 for $20 special and had that. Chicken tenders are always good here. Our server was so nice too. Our lil ones loved their kiddie menu food. The burgers are always good here and big. Fries are yummy. 1/2 slab of ribs were good size for the special too.

Ginger M.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/10/2015,"After the service today, we will not be coming back.  Here's the short version: - Crowd waiting at the door and hostess MIA (busy cleaning tables) - Wait staff walking by without acknowledging our table - Waiters having in aisle discussion on who would be working our table. - Appetizer forgotten twice and ultimately arrived after meal. - Queso was sub-par - Tasted and looked like it had been simmering for days. - Plates provided for our shared meal were dripping wet.   - New plates requested but never received.  (Instead we grabbed the to-go containers stacked near us and ate off of those.) Suggestions: - Hostess should be there to greet and seat customers - not clean tables. - Waiters should know what section they are working before customers arrive.   - Discussions on who is working where should take place off the floor and not in front of customers. - Appetizers should arrive before the meal, especially when requested as such. - Plates should be dried off before being given to customers. - Food should be served fresh and hot. - Wait staff should do what they say they are going to do.  (ie. be right back...)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20

My mind left the building so I could not remember if there was music playing or not, it there was music it never made my ears, but I can't hear anyway so it didn't matter.   I ordered the chicken tenders with corn on the cob and fries, my friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich with BBQ sauce and loaded mashed potatoes. Well I like Katy Perry songs and that has nothing to do with anything I just threw it in. I kissed a girl and I liked it!! The service was good and the location very clean I loved my chicken tenders, very moist and easy to cut and made my taste buds want to kiss another girl.  Wait I already said that. The corn was good. The fries, someone kick my ass if I ever order fries again!  My friend liked the pulled pork sandwich but not the BBQ sauce. We left; does anyone see that it is very difficult to get out of this intersection?  I had to go right to then turn around at a light so I could go left!  Believe me it was safer that way!

The quality is chain restaurant predictable - blah. We got our appetizer, but hadn't ordered the hair interweaved into the southwestern egg rolls. After we pulled out the first hair, we discovered the 2nd one - in the same piece! The staff was a little antsy on what to do...my husband just asked to replace the one piece - then a different passing waiter stated he'd get us another plate of them. Our food came...my son's ""pizza"" was a pathetic whiter than white piece of doughy goo with a stingy amount of cheap marinara and a little bit of shredded cheese on the top.  The rest of us got what we expected - not much. AFTER dinner was on the table a manager came over and said he thought we just wanted one egg roll to replace the hairy one. (?!) He got right on getting us another replacement appetizer and wanted us to know he would take it off the bill too (um, isn't that just basic consideration?)

What do you say about Chili's?  The meat was almost too easy to eat; my companion said his burger felt like an approximation of a burger that hadn't quite reached its ideal point - sort of like Plato's chair.  It seems like the fries are reconstituted mashed potatoes fried into stick form, which makes them almost gummable and addictive like Pringles.  My BBQ sauce on the (falling-apart-tender) ribs was sickly sweet (I got the Shiner Bock sauce, in case you're wondering).  It was just.... well, it would have been better with a few margaritas, I'll say that.  I've had way better ribs locally at Rudy's, Mesa Ranch and Bert's. So Chili's, while I won't be back any time soon, thanks for the sustenance.  There's just too much good food in Austin to spend any more time in places like you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20?start=20

You get two stars for at least giving us the information online, but you should have options for people who don't want to be crane lifted out of their homes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20?start=40
Emma N.,"Cedar Park, TX",1,29,3,2.0,1/5/2013,"Me and my BF got carry out today. At 3pm ( not exactly a busy time in the restaurant ) we waited about 5 minutes just to be helped at the ""to go"" counter. Other workers in the building did not even acknowledge us. Ok, so far not great but not the end of the world either.  The guy who came over to help us was polite to us. He was courteous and helpful. That is the only reason they get two stars instead of one.   The food was ready when we got there which was about 15 minutes after we called. I got the Chicken fajitas and the bf got some three piece app for his meal. He picked two kinds of chicken and some little hamburger thingys.  His food was ok. not spectacular and not uneatable. Just ok. Mine, MEH, I've had better food made by my 3 year old niece. Upon opening the box to be sure everything was there I noticed they had only given me tort's, a small small portion of chicken, tons and tons of onions and a few strips of green peppers. No Cheese, no lettuce, blah....once he returned with some lettuce, some sour cream (both a good sized portion) and some cheese, I noticed that the cheese was in one of those 2oz to go cups, and was only 1/3 of the way full. UGH! the best part is the cheese! I asked him to get me some more which he quickly did.  We got home and I have to say the veggies (massive amounts of onions and small amount of green peppers) where either over or under cooked. The only reasoning I can come up with for this is that they over cooked the veggies threw a ton of onions in under cooked those and then threw them all in my container to take home. PFFT!~ Thanks for charging me the same price as you would in the restaurant but not even close to the same quality chili's In the end I will never go to this location for take out again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20?start=40
Natalie B.,"Round Rock, TX",8,26,,2.0,1/17/2012,"The thing I like about Chili's is that I know what to expect. Sure, sometimes you want a culinary adventure, but other times you just want to stop in, eat something that tastes good, and get on with your day. Normally, Chili's fulfills all those requirements fairly well, but not today!  We went at lunch time, and the waiting area near the entrance was packed. We were told that there would be a 5-10 minute wait, so my husband stayed to listen for our name while I went to use the restroom. On the way to the restroom, I noticed that there were plenty of empty, clean tables--but no one was being seated at them! The hostess kept disappearing to the kitchen, to the bar, to bus tables--she was everywhere except the hostess station. In our first 10 minutes of waiting, not one party was seated. After 20 minutes, three parties were seated that had come in after my husband and I, while we were still waiting. My husband asked the hostess why those people had been seated before us when we had been waiting longer, and she said, ""Oh, because I scratched your name off the list."" She never called our name, just decided to arbitrarily scratch it off the list. She apologized for the wait, but didn't apologize for her mistake. Finally, we were seated. The food was fine, but our server seemed very rushed. When my husband asked for lime for his water, the server went to the drink station, cut up a lime, and delivered it back to my husband in his bare hand. We're not germophobes, so that didn't particularly bother us, but it was kind of strange. I'll still go to Chili's. Heck, I'll probably still go to this Chili's. But this was definitely not a great Chili's experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20?start=40
Brian J.,"Austin, TX",2,4,,4.0,10/12/2011,"yeah, i know, its austin, gotta keep it local...whatever. Service at majority of your mom and pop places is crap, and the food mediocre...this is not a big city with great food, so lets stop lying to ourselves.  This place is among the big monsters of chain casual dining joints, but this location has always provided great service and the food always being the same, in a good way.  Yeah, it's not the healthiest place but it's good...and service is welcoming and sincere unlike most hippy, college places that have vegan ass clowns waiting on you with crap, hipster wannabie attitudes",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20?start=40
AJ E.,"Austin, TX",0,15,,1.0,8/14/2012,"So, I gave this place a pretty good review a few months ago.  I'm disappointed to retract it now.  A couple of days ago (August 8, 2012 if I recall correctly), I was here with my family for the nth time.  We frequent(ed) this place and pretty much walk in and out of here without remark... until now. As usual, I order a half-portion of their Texas Cheese Fries for an appetizer.  Something unusual came with it this time, though.  As I was chewing a mouthful of gooey, cheesy fries topped with a jalapeno and some bacon bits, I noticed something was hesitant be shredded to bits by my teeth.  And believe me, I was trying.  For a moment, I considered giving up and just swallowing.  I didn't think much of it.  Until I kept chewing... I put my fingers in my mouth and reach for this un-chewable, hard thing.  To my extreme disgust, I pulled out a GIANT fingernail.  This thing could have been a toenail.  Anyway, how do I know it wasn't mine?  Because I don't grow my fingernails out half an inch.  It was also coated in cheese.  I had to wipe off the cheese to make sure it was what I thought it was.  I took a picture of this fingernail, right next to the mouthful of Texas Cheese Fries I spit out with it.  I wish I could share it here to validate my story. By the time the waiter came back with our food, I politely told him to take the food back and let us pay for the drinks we ordered so that we can leave.  He fetched the manager; an Asian lady I've seen many times before (although she does not know/recognize me).  Even she was shocked.  She was profusely polite (and not just then - she always has been quite courteous).  She asked if there was anything she could do.  Nope.  I just wanted to walk out of there.  She declined my offer to pay for drinks (not even the margarita was a good-enough chaser) and gave us her sincere apology. Now, I've been here countless times before without incident.  I really liked this place.  However, after this, in good conscience I cannot recommend that anyone eat here until whatever sanitation issue in the kitchen is resolved.  A fingernail, folks.  Not a little clipping either.  And I THOUGHT TO SWALLOW IT.  I was under the assumption that those in food service had to keep their nails clipped...  I just gagged again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20?start=40
