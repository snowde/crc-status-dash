Annette R.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,7,,4.0,9/10/2017,"We Love eating here at the Rosedale Hwy Chili's! We eat here at least one night a week.  The food is good.  We LOVE the 3 for $10  special that they run periodically. If that is not available, then we usually order the steakhouse combo or the faitas.  The chicken breast in the steakhouse combo is cooked correctly every time.  It is so moist & never dry. And the endless chips are great. They even stay fresh in the take home bag.  And the staff is great. The red headed hostess, that is now blond, knows us by name & always recalls the area that we like to sit. And  the waiter (John) is quick on his feet & keeps an eye out for the almost empty glasses.  Thank you staff for  always making it an enjoyable evening out!

Katherine C.,"Bakersfield, CA",36,82,509,2.0,1/5/2018,"Unfortunately it's just really subpar. Everything was mediocre, from the tableside guacamole, which was unsalted and lacking flavor, to the margarita, which was so watered down you couldn't even tell it was strawberry, to the steak enchiladas, which were greasy and made with poor quality meat, to the burgers, which had far too much bread for the meat. I wouldn't come here again. Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4
Charles M.,"Bakersfield, CA",81,341,340,3.0,8/5/2017,Chili's is just not a restaurant I would frequent. It's loud and the food is mediocre. We went because it was a family gathering and we had no choice. This is the second time we have been to a Chili's and both times we were disappointed. Here the service was good and although the server was obviously new he did a good job and will be an asset to the restaurant. Donna had the chicken fajitas and I had the sirloin leather steak. No seasoning on my steak and cut like an old shoe.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4
Crystal A.,"Bakersfield, CA",85,22,13,5.0,1/7/2018,"I don't ever typically have good luck when it comes to Chili's, but at this location I've had nothing but the best service and best tasting food the past handful of times. I am typically a ""picky eater"", but this location gets it just right every time. Also, the staff is GREAT and the service is speedy. I love the bar area at this particular location. They always have a full staff, the food comes out hot and exactly how I wanted it , the drinks are great and the manager personally approached us today to ensure our visit wasn't anything less than extraordinary. If you're going to go to any Chili's , I highly recommend this location over the Gosford location any and every day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4
Kat T.,"Alexandria, VA",72,109,207,3.0,5/28/2017,"Ok, update to my last review.  My kids wanted Chili's, so I gave in.  I must say, service has improved significantly since my last couple visits.  The menu was revamped and probably the training the servers received, because, service was on par today--quite impressed.   I was able to add myself on the waitlist through Yelp.  I like that feature.  Our waitress, Lauren, was pretty attentive.  The food was good too.  First time I tried the Chili at Chili's--it was good but not the best.  It was more soupy like rather than thick and meaty.  I tried the Caribbean Salad and I actually like it.  They cut fresh pineapple which was a nice touch to the salad.  First time I tried the guacamole with the chips and salsa and I liked it. It had big chunks of Avocado, which I actually like it that way. I do like how you can pay on the electronic thingamajig.  Very convenient!  I can tell the staff worked well together and as a team.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4
Bryana W.,"Bakersfield, CA",9,55,51,4.0,12/20/2017,"I love chili's! Normally I always get the original queso and nachos. This last time my boyfriend and I tried the meat platter and had queso and egg rolls. The egg rolls are always amazing and of course the queso. The meat platter I didn't care for but my boyfriend liked it. It was $17.99 for a 3 choice meat platter and my boyfriend wanted ribs so it was an extra $2. To me it wasn't worth it but he liked it. We got crispy chicken( which was good with buffalo sauce I ordered), jalapeño sausage (I didn't care for it at all) and ribs (boyfriend wanted to try them since everyone says chili's ribs are good). Bill came out to $37 which wasn't too bad for all the food and leftovers for his lunch the next day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4

Miriam P.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,4,14,5.0,11/28/2017,Chili's is a good place just to go quickly after shopping at target. Food is inexpensive and food comes out fairly fast.

Iris C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,4.0,12/16/2017,The waiter was pretty good and the food came reasonably quick but the only thing wrong is that they kicked somebody that I know out of a booth and they were just sitting down but they did get another booth after waiting about 20 min but overall I give this yelp review4 stars only because of the kicking out but the waiter was nice and helped a lot  aka she is a snake,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4

Marie H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,4,,4.0,8/31/2017,"I enjoy Chili's and always have trouble in deciding what to eat. Usually I always order the same thing when I go out to eat because I know what I like. Here though, I get pasta, steak, burgers, or even salad. They used to have really good potato skins but they've changed the menu since and now have Texas cheese fries which are pretty good.  Regarding the service, it seems to be getting better. Today we were seated next to a very loud group of people and without us even asking the hostess asked us if we would like to sit somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4
O'Neesha F.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2017,"I decided to take my mother out to eat and we had a bad experience. We received our silverware and i had a piece of food still stuck to my fork. My mother ordered GRILLED CHICKEN FAJITAS and the chicken nor the onions and bell peppers were grilled. Also the wooden plate they served on the bottom of the hot plate was dirty and had old food stains on it. The onions smelled spoiled. I order the 6 oz sirloin and asked for it to be extra well done and it was still pink. And my steak tasted like a hamburger patty.

Sabrina H.,"Bakersfield, CA",32,16,5,4.0,8/3/2017,Good food but here is a scary thought.  Have you ever noticed how they leave the water pitcher alone.

Ash N.,"Bakersfield, CA",24,188,6,3.0,2/23/2017,Came here today to have a date with my daughter . Service started out great . I had a coupon for a free dessert and wanted to use it. I had told the waiter so he could take it off my bill . I start wanting to pay my bill on the kiosk but it wasn't working. On the kiosk my total was 17$ when he brought me a receipt it wasn't itemized it just said 25.00. I then call over a different waiter and ask for an itemized receipt . Then I noticed he was billing me for the dessert even though I said it was my birthday. Felt like he was being somewhat dishonest with me by not bringing me an itemized total. Leads me to believe that when I left he was going to take off the dessert and take the 7$ on top of what ever tip I was giving . Anyways my tip to you is ask for an itemized receipt . Looks like I can't trust chilis anymore.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4

I ordered a Triple dipper Chkn crispers , mouth bites and egg rolls ... Crispers looked old and tasted old .. Everything tastes like it had been sitting for a while !! My husband steak was very rare  I specifically asked for ranch and bbq sauce with my order.  I got one ranch no bbq..  when we received our order I asked if the ranch and bbq was in my bag ... bartender said yes! I'm giving them  two stars only because our drinks and my husbands ribs were good...

Trish S.,"Bakersfield, CA",47,89,92,3.0,10/8/2015,"Good fish tacos.  Good Southwestern Eggrolls.  Good burgers.  Great in-house made pickles!  They were the deciding factor in where to eat.  The food, overall, is consistently decent. The service could use some work.  The servers are friendly enough, but with 3 servers per table, we spent as much time saying we were 'fine' as we did eating. Only one of the servers had a key card for the computer, and there is no cash register, so paying in cash proved to take a long time.  The service model just didn't make sense to me, and seemed to be more annoying than convenient, through no fault of the servers themselves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4?start=40
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2921,14307,3.0,6/19/2014,"It always seems to be busy here.  I like Chili's fine.  One of the more consistent chain restaurants out there.  The 2 for $20 dinner special is a good deal.  It includes one appetizer to share with your partner and two entrees.   Some Notes from our latest visit: The Cinnamon Molten cake ($6.89) is pretty good.  (3 stars) The Chocolate Cookie Skillet ($5.99) is terrific.  (4.5 stars) Mix & Match Fajita Trio ($15.39) is good.  (3 stars) 1/2 rack ribs with side ($10.79) is good.  (3 stars) Service was friendly and attentive at the bar area. (4 stars) The atmosphere was cool at the bar area with all the sports programs. (3.5 stars) I really enjoy going to Chili's once in awhile (especially when we have a gift card!!)  Have not had a bad experience yet.  If you get one of their specials, then you can really save money.  If you join their e-mail club, then they will send you coupons or deals almost every week.   Make sure to save room for dessert when you come here.  For me, it is the best part of the meal at Chili's!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4?start=40
Ren C.,"Bakersfield, CA",254,31,34,4.0,11/16/2014,"Haven't eaten here in over a year! Place looks like it improved on appearance which is good. More modern looking. The menus also changed a bit. Some previous items before aren't there anymore. Quite a bit of improvement.  Packed in a Sunday which I'm not surprised but for a 15-20 minute wait it wasn't bad.  We waited at the other 2 benches in between the first and second door and boy do they need some air in there. It's pretty stuffy waiting in that area.  Got sat and our waitress was pretty attentive. Looked like she wasn't happy at first but as time went on she seemed like she got better.  So here's our order: Drinks - 2 Arnold palmers one strawberry and one with mango (btw mango is so bomb!) Appetizer- triple dipper samplers (spring rolls, boneless bbq chicken and the mini burgers) all were pretty tasty! Main course - Crispy crispers: came with chicken strips corn & fries.  It was pretty much mediocre. They could have added a     bit more flavor or seasoning on the chicken. It was kind of bland.  Sweet & smokey burger: burger was pretty good according to my boyfriend. It was just perfect the way it was.  Overall, everything was pretty good. Our service wasn't that bad and food was mediocre on my part but I'll make sure to have some burgers the next time I visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4?start=40

Liss P.,"Bakersfield, CA",47,101,178,5.0,3/24/2016,"Upon arrival greeted and seated in less than 3 mins.  I noticed the bartenders were very friendly and smiling. Great impression. The waitstaff were very attentive to their tables. And mine was no exception. Destiny was very personablean d made suggestions.  I chose loaded baked potato soupEXCELLENT FLAVOR! The best I've had ever. I ordered bottomless chips with salsa and guac. The chips are thin and crisp. FRESH! The salsa fresh with chipoltle seasoning. NICE. Guacamole made at your table if you request the TABLESIDE guacamole.  For those who were not aware, this location is their training location for California's Central area. It's very busy (but with plenty of seating) and from what I observed at 9:20 pm on a Thursday night, people love to eat here. I was surprised by their star rating. Don't be fooled. It could be that their really great service is not being reported by their loyal fans or satisfied patrons.

We also ordered the enchilada soup (it's ok), fish taco, and shrimp taco. Those tacos were good, but the carnitas taco was out of this world. The service was good. We sat at the bar and the bar tender was quick with refills and food delivery. Very sweet hostess named Sky gave us a nice welcome.  Restrooms and eating area were clean and it was a nice atmosphere.

Tim P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,8,,1.0,3/19/2015,"Went for lunch on a Thursday. Service was poor; no one was rude, just perfunctory. Salad dishes left on table after other food served. No one checked back till we were almost through. Expediter stopped back to ask if all was alright, and before my wife could respond she said ""good"" and left. I had the new double cheese burger, ""New"" fresco salad, fries. Fries good. That's all. ""Fresco salad"" = some leaves, vinaigrette, crumbled queso fresco (cheap cheap cheap)  Burger was deplorable. Meat patties exact flavor of McDonalds- I would bet they are supplied from same processing plant. Cooked dry and hard. Served on a dry bready bun with re hardened cheese, some lettuce and mustard. The whole experience smacks of a restaurant cutting corners as they dive bomb out of business. I will never go to another chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4?start=40

I know from past experiences to not order a burger, but with the assurance that they recently revamped their burgers, I ordered one. My dining partner ordered pasta with no tomatoes and requested it be brought out hot off the oven.

At 11:23 I was given a drink, and by 11:28 there was a bowl of soup placed in front of me. Seriously ten minutes for a drink that is literally 20 feet away. A turtle would have gotten it to me faster! Anyhow more time goes by and at 11:36 another waiter? brings over my cheesburger (barely warm) and fries (room temperature). I informed the waiter that none of my food was hot. He was gracious and apologized, and offered to have the food made again. My lunch ""hour"" is only 45 minutes, and I did not have time for another 23 minute wait for a cheeseburger and fries. So I just left. If the staff would have delivered the food at like15 to eighteen minutes, it would have been fresh and hot. The food actually looked good, but I guess I won't ever know.

My husband had a fajita chicken salad, which was surprisingly super fresh and very tasty and our waitress was fast, courteous and friendly. Everything seemed to go well until the tail end of our meal when another waitress that was not helping us came up behind our table with an attitude as she started ranting that we couldn't use the outlet plug. She was super rude and my husband and I tried to explain that the hostess is the one who allowed us to use the outlet for our laptop and that we were just leaving anyway. She was obviously angry and kept complaining that it should have not been done etc. She made a huge ass deal and it ruined the wonderful meal we had.

Today i ordered my drink in a to go cup and just a bowl of soup it took 40 minutes to get my soup and he brought my drink in regular cup.

So still waiting and finally someone else comes by saying would you like to pay? Well duh!! I understand most of the people working here are not career waiters waitresses but please really  how hard is it to screw up a dr pepper in a to go cup and a bowl of potato soup?

Anyways we told her we wanted Oscar to place a to go order for us and she said sorry you have to go to the bar and we said no we've been there waiting and once again she said sorry he cant do that.... Then Oscar walked up shook our hands and had our order ready within 5 min and asked if we needed a water while we wait and HE apologized for the nonsense everywhere.   My question is wheres the management?!?!?!!?  Really it's amazing how long the girl at the front was texting and ignoring everyone from customers to her own team members.  Welcome to chilis we like to ignore you until you ask us if you can sit in the EMPTY booths that were everywhere on the restaurant side.  What an Epic fail!

My coworker and I sat at the bar because the wait was over 30 minutes on a week day during lunch! As soon as we sat down the bartender mentioned how busy she was. We already knew what we wanted and we told her that. She asked us to wait because she still had other customer's orders to take. As we ate our dessert for lunch ;) we watched her put a pitcher under the Blue Moon tap and turn it on. She walked away.  About 5 minutes later she noticed the beer was over flowing the pitcher and flowing down the bar. She ended up wasting the beer by the way. Fail! She finally gave us the check and ran the card, but ran the wrong amount!! She did correct it after I asked her to. Horrible service the entire time we were there.
