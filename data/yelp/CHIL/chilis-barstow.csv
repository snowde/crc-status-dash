Kimmie N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",62,96,733,4.0,8/23/2017,"We visit this restaurant on the way home from Vegas.  It was a great because it was next to the Tesla charging station, so we did not need to walk a far distance and was able to charge the Tesla at the same time.  I came inside first, it was pretty empty, I can only see one staff at the bar. I did not know if I seat myself or wait for someone. There were no signs or staff around. I walked to the bar and finally got the attention of the bartender. She said for me to wait and someone will seat me.  So I walked back by the podium and waited for the waitress to sit me. There are no hostess at this restaraunt. I sat down, and had my drinks ordered. The waitress was nice and sweet.  She took our order and then someone else brought out the food. People were going in and out. The restaraunt was empty and not full to capacity.  The food: I order the asparagus for appetizers and they were delicious. It was fried but it should not have been too fried because the esparagus was overcooked.  I received my Santa Fe salads and it was excellent. I really like the salad here. It was delicious.  My friend ordered me a Watermelon drink, it had vodka in it, but not too much ice. It was delicious as well.  When I was eating, I begin people come in and start seating themselves, they did not wait. I think this restaraunt needs to be more clearer about seating procedures instead of making me or other people chasing around a staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow

She checked in on us often and made sure we had everything. Food came pretty quick and was really great. Definitely gave me a food coma though for the rest of the ride to Vegas.

Katharine -.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,111,307,5.0,5/16/2017,Pat was our server... she was outstanding!  She was graceful and was killing it in the floor all by herself. We were blown away with her work ethic.  Came on our way back from our road trip to charge and decided on a bite to eat with so many choices to choose from we  we choose Chili's.  And because of her we will be returning to this Chilis!  The food was so good. Thanks Pat for your great customer service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow
Stan C.,"Henderson, NV",135,380,203,5.0,1/4/2017,"Driving LA to Vegas we needed a pit stop, a charge, as well as a relatively quick meal. Chili's shares the parking lot with the Tesla charger, so it's an ideal spot for a 30 minutes snack. This is a fairly typical Chili's restaurant. The decorating is unexciting, but it is neat and clean. Our server, Kara, was at our table almost immediately after we sat down with a big welcoming smile and answers to the questions we had about the menu. We started with the California grilled chicken flatbread. Boy was that great!! In addition to the grilled chicken, it had smoked bacon, tomato sauce, monterey jack and mozzarella cheese, and avocado. It was drizzled with roasted garlic aioli. A little spicy but not too much. Great way to start the meal. And it came out relatively fast so there was no delay and getting back on the road. We also shared the fajitas. We got it with chicken and shrimp. Next time I will get double shrimp and leave out the chicken. Another really good dish. I will definitely plan to stop here again on my next LA to Vegas trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow
Lorena S.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,102,149,5.0,7/30/2017,I have not eaten at a Chilis in over a year because of the consistently bad service I have received. Came here today because it's what the group voted on. Loved the updated menu and choices but the experience was taken to another level due to our waitress Benji. She was so pleasant and attentive. Because of today I am going to give my local Chilis another try.  Food Lighter side menu sirloin and roasted avocado and tomatoes - perfectly cooked and pretty big for the price  Santa Fe salad with grilled chicken - the spice was of the chicken was very flavorful Avacado chicken bacon sandwich - amazing!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow

We waited another 10 - still no greeting - finally we were approached and advised  that the wait was going to be 15 minutes. We left.

Ava W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,5,5.0,7/30/2017,"Friendly and fast service from Benji today. She was efficient and very welcoming. My husband had the Caribbean Salad with shrimp. It was colorful, fresh, and tasty. It looked so good, I'll probably have it with chicken next time  we come. I had a side of broccoli which was slightly crisp, not over cooked at all. We shared guacamole. I ate most of the guacamole which was yummy. The salsa was tasty too. The chips were average chips. We will definitely be back when we are in Barstow next. Another plus, it's super close to the Tesla charging station. And lastly, I used the restroom while I was there and one of the employees wearing a hairnet was in the restroom at the same time. She washed her hands thoroughly with soap and then used her paper towel to turn off the water and open the door. Loved seeing great hygiene from someone who is probably preparing my food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow
Athena C.,"Corona, CA",172,43,42,1.0,8/6/2017,"Not that they care about reviews, I'll add my experience anyways. We stopped in as usual while our Tesla charges. We come here about 4-6 times a month on our way to and from Vegas. We always sit in the bar and have had always had great service. But today, today we had Cindy.  We got our order in, chips and guacamole came out right away (unfortunately the avocados were not ripe and my attempt at mashing them was not making them into guac). To top it off, they left the skin from the seed in there.  We finished our drinks after about 15/20 min of sitting there never to have our waitress return to offer a refill.  About an hour later the food comes out. Mind you, the salad I asked for, for them to bring out BEFORE the meal, never came!  The expediter asked if we needed extra plates to which we replied ""yes!"". And she NEVER returned.  Waited about 10 minutes and then asked for a manager.  The server we asked, returned and said the manager was coming right out. Another 8 minutes passes, still no manager. Oh, but good ol' Cindy has shown back up now and ready to fill our drinks. How thoughtful! When we explained the above to her, she just smiled and said ""ok, have a good day"". No apologies, no excuses...just a passive aggressive response with a smile to boot! Not only was the customer service piss poor, but you'd expect as a regular, you'd get some attention when something goes wrong.  Over an hour here, no drink refills, pathetic guac, and so pissed that no manager ever showed up- we left without eating.  The only thing this place has going for it is that it's conveniently located next to the Tesla Supercharger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow

He was attentive without being overly friendly. My bunless burger was delicious as was my skinny margarita. I love the kiosks on the table that let you pay whenever you're ready.

Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,443,537,2.0,8/26/2015,"It's been a while since I dined at Chili's and I noticed it's changed a bit. The decor is trendier and now they have these kiosk tablets at all the tables where you are able to order food, check your Chili's account, play games, and pay for the food. I hate this little kiosk thing because it's so impersonal. We were able to order our food with the server but that's pretty much the only time we saw him. We had a difficult time catching the staff's attention to remove the massive amount of empty cups and dishes pilling up from our table. And when it came time to pay, you slide your cc through the kiosk and walk out. There's no need to wait for the check and the servers also don't bother to say goodbye either. But perhaps the detached service is exclusive to this one visit.  The Food: Nachos: Yes! I love how they put the cheese and toppings on each chip individually. This makes for a perfect and consistent bite.  Boneless Buffalo Chicken: No. Too vinegary and slightly dry.  Salmon: Delicious, highly recommended. Surprisingly very good.  Taco, enchilada, and tostada: Sorry, didn't do it for me. Flavors were all off. Overall, I'd try Chili's again because this could have been a fluke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow?start=20

I hate to send it back because we've already waited at least 30 minutes for it. The booths are also extraordinarily uncomfortable with one side or the other far away from the table. I want comfort after a long day of travel. I give it 2 stars because sometimes the food does taste good though my husband has had a tasteless burger.

We have sent back food for being cold, been forgotten about at our table by the waitress (to the point where our order wasn't wen submitted to the kitchen--- we left on that occasion) and have had variations of less than acceptable service and quality of food on MANY, MANY OCCASIONS.

Michael G.,"Chicago, IL",1,59,14,2.0,1/13/2016,"This place was well below your average Chili's.....The only reason why I am giving it two stars was because after 15 minutes of being seated, the busboy came and asked if we were helped and ended up going out of his way to take our order.

Peter C.,"Alhambra, CA",369,599,1118,3.0,10/8/2013,"Wow - most of the reviews of this place are pretty negative with bad service seeming to be the biggest complaint.  I gotta admit that the appeal of Chili's to me is probably  based on my college days, but there are days that I miss this food, especially since there are no locations close to the Pasadena area.  The chance to eat at Chili's on my way to Vegas seemed so appealing that I just had to do it. Mrs. C clearly ordered the best, with her pick 3 appetizers out of 8 or 9 items  I liked everything on her plate & should have ordered that.  I got the crispy chicken tacos with rice & beans which were ok, but pretty similar to something that I could have made at home with frozen chicken strips in a toaster oven & some tortillas.  However, the roasted corn guacamole was a huge serving & *excellent*.  Definitely getting this the next time I'm at a Chili's. I'd say that the service was a tad slow, but nothing like what the other Yelpers experienced.  Maybe corporate is paying attention to the reviews & put in some additional training or managers.  A competent meal gets 3 stars to hopefully balance out all of the problems that seem to be fixed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow?start=40

Christopher S.,"Fort Worth, TX",8,18,11,2.0,10/9/2015,"Stuck in Barstow for work, two week stretches. This place is within walking distance of the hotel, so that's where I've been eating for an entire week now.  Staff:  mediocre. Michelle is awesome, but nobody else really takes the time to pay attention to you as a customer. If you've used their table side ""ziosk"" system to pay prior to your meal, forget amenities such as refills:  they already got their cash, and could not care less about you as a customer. Think that changes if they're empty?  Think again. I've walked out three days this week after the most bare bones service you could get from a sit down restaurant .  Food:  decent, depending on what you order. Made the mistake of ordering a steak the first day, and asked for it medium rare. It was served so grossly overdone and dry that old leather could be considered more tender. Started hitting the ""lite mex"" menu, and it's fairly decent. The chicken is a low quality but it's juicy and tender. The salmon has a decent flavor if you tell them not to cover it in their sugary sauces. The salads are crispy-ish, and the southwest chicken soup is yummy.  Overall, this place most likely stays open out of a combination monopoly in the area and all the outlet mall busses that saturates the area daily.

For food I ordered the shrimp tacos...which was probably a bad idea in the first place because I usually never order anything fish related from a place that isn't close to a body of water or known for seafood. But either way it wasn't so great. The sauce they used was sweet and the tacos were salty in general. The guacamole was also too salty. Also tried some of the steak and it wasn't so great (salty again).  Probably won't be back here for dinner unless it just for the drinks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow?start=40
Sunny G.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,105,,1.0,2/12/2017,"We stopped in for take out on our way back from Cal yesterday.  It was a last minute decision to go to Chili's so we didn't call our order in ahead, big mistake.  We walk in to the take out area & were asked by one of the servers if we had placed our order yet and we said no we didn't get a chance to but we would just order now.  The server said someone would be right w/ us so we waited...and waited...and no one came by to take our order.  I figured it would just be easier if I hopped online and just placed our order using my phone.  So we waited for approximately 25 mins for our order to be ready and my husband goes back in to get our food.  Once again, one of the server tells my husband someone will be right w/ you, this time w/ an added ""hun"" which is so freaking annoying.  My husband waits another 10 mins and no one comes by to help him.  He tries asking two different servers about our order which he literally saw waiting & bagged up on their counter but gets ignored, so frustrating.  After another 5 or 10 mins someone finally comes by and gets our order to us.  My husband lets the server know how long he had been waiting but the server says he didn't see my husband standing there???  When we finally get a chance to eat our fajitas which was about 3 hours later when we made it home, the grilled steak fajitas was entirely inedible as one portion was literally way too undercooked and the other portion was way too grisly to chew!!!!  I cannot tell you how incredibly annoyed I was last night.  Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere, this establishment is terrible.  I should've looked at the other yelp reviews before coming here, go figure 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow?start=40

D B.,"Oceanside, CA",2,110,7,4.0,1/2/2016,"Had dinner here tonight. We chose open seating in the bar because it was packed and people were waiting.  I ordered a beer and a double shot. She said there was a 1 drink max per person. So she said she would bring a single shot with my beer. This was still breaking the rules, but she felt she could get away with it.  She came back with our drinks, and that single shot turned into a quad shot(4 If you do not embrace math terms). I am not complaining mind you...especially after the 2nd round. I was only charged $8.39 a glass for these quad shots. This was dirt cheap. Fiance had a blackberry margarita which was ok?  On to the food. I had the classic bacon burger. It was filling, but tasted sweet. That's weird. Fiance had an Old Timer burger which was greasy, but otherwise ok.

Marcus O.,"Barstow, CA",25,10,5,3.0,1/11/2015,"As a whole I'm disapointed with the brand. I don't like their menu changes - moving away from their casual Tex-Mex and going into a more trendy South-West. This has resulted in several menu casualties that my friends abd I enjoyed: RIP Buffalo Chicken Fajitas, Mushroom Burger, and Chicken Fried Steak. However, this review is based on this paticular restuarant. I gave it +1 for the service and a +1 for food taste; our server was friendly and attentive. He came a checked on us regularly which is rare for a Barstow joint. My group all got different burgers and they tasted acceptable, and all seemed to be going for a higher-end look but had an slightly better than average taste.  A reluctant +1 for cost: ranging from $9 to $12 for the burgers which is what you expect from casual dining digs for a ham-burgs - I'd still prefer to go to In-&-Out for my collin killing fix. However, I have to give a -1 for the mistake of basically giving us all the same burger: mine was a Sweet Smokehouse (or something like that) which came with Onion Rings, sauce, and cheese. Friend 1 got a Southern Smokehouse (not the same as mine) which was saposed to have bacon, cheese, and another kind of sauce. Friend 2 got a basic Cheeseburger with bacon. Instead, friend 1 got a cheeseburger with sauce and friend two got thr dame thing with bacon. Mine was fine. I know it sounds confusing but I read the descriptions of each item out of curiosity, and it matters because each burger had a different price so they all should have been unique. Our server comped us some onion rings to make friend 1's burger more Smokehousey so that worked.  It was busy which explains the mix-up, but professional cooks should still know the difference in their food. Overall, it was still a fun and good experience - and I will go back mainly because there are not many other places in Barstow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow?start=80

Hopefully they will build an Applebee's out here one day so this place has some competition and stop acting like their shit don't stink. It will be awhile before I roll back into this place again and if I do I will just stick to happy hour at the bar and leave the food alone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow?start=100

D K.,"West Hollywood, CA",29,93,,1.0,6/2/2011,"On our way back from a Vegas bachelor party we planned the requisite stop at In-N-Out Barstow. Becuase In-N-Out is delicious and because that's what you do on your way back from Vegas. In fact, I made my buddy the bachelor -- who was starving -- wait till Barstow to eat. ""Dude, relax, your Double-Double will be that much more delicious."" In-N-Out was closed that Sunday (Easter Sunday). Oops, my bad. But then my buddy had what seemed like a brilliant idea: what about the Chili's across the street. For the win. Chili's is one of the better chain restaurants. What could go wrong? Answer: the spinach dip (bland and cold). The service (also bland and cold).  My rum-and-pineapple (bland and warm). This is not your typical Chili's.

Wendy C.,"Orange County, CA",670,433,1091,1.0,6/30/2010,"One would think going to a 'Chain' restaurant is a safe bet.  You'd expect the food to be consistent or at least somewhat close.  NOT HERE!!!!   I've always liked Chili's.  No, they don't have the finest food on earth, but they do have a few dishes I like.  When I just don't feel like driving more than 10 minutes to go somewhere or eating fast food, I can go to Chili's and have a descent meal.   On our way back from Vegas, I just didn't want to have tacos, burgers, or chicken at Barstow again, so I told my fiance to stop at Chili's.  When we walked in, we were greeted and led to a booth which still had crumbs all over the seats.  The host quickly grabbed a wet towel to wipe them.  One would think he could have just seated us at another booth because the restaurant was pretty empty.  He dropped the menu and left.  I had to grab some napkins from another table to wipe the seats again b/c they were too wet to sit. When we sat down and put our hands on the table, we got ketchup on our arms!  What was wrong with these people?  They weren't even busy and they couldn't even clean the table/seats right?  Then the host brought over a couple of forks wrapped in napkins.  He said, sorry, we only have forks.  The waiter later explained that the kitchen couldn't clean the knife fast enough.  WTF?  Next to my food.  I ordered 1/2 rack of baby back ribs thinking I've had this many times before at the Chili's near my house and they have always been pretty good.  But when I took a bite, they were cold!!!  My guess is that they ribs were 'pre-cooked' and when someone orders it, they just put on some BBQ sauce and pop them in the microwave oven to heat.  And they couldn't even heat them hot!!!!  I ended up eating only 2 pieces (of the 6 pieces).  This was the WORST baby back ribs I've ever had in my whole life!!!   Unfortunately I also had to make a stop at the rest room and it was messy as hell.  Paper towel everywhere on the floor.  Com'on!  Even Del Taco's restroom is cleaner than yours!   I thought Bob's Big Boy was bad!  Chili's was worse!!!  If you must stop to refuel at Barstow, stick with fast food.  I've learned my lessons now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-barstow?start=120

Ridiculous!! Finally we were so irritated we found the manager to see if she was aware and if there was some explanation. All she says is sorry, would a free dessert make it any better?

Finally one of the guys that had looked in our direction multiple times already stopped and asked if anyone had helped us yet. We put in our drink and appetizer order in and waited some more. Once our drinks and appetizer came out he put them down and scurried off before we could ask for anything. No plates, no napkins, nothing to eat our appetizer with properly. When our food came out everything looked old and dry. My enchilada was hard and stale, to a point where I couldn't even cut it. My beans seemed to have a dried out layer like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile. My kids' side of celery had brown spots all over them. Their cheeseburgers had no cheese. We asked for an extra plate so they could share but no one ever came back. Except for the times when our food and drinks were brought out, we never saw a server.
