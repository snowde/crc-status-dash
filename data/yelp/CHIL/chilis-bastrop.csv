Tiffany S.,"Houston, TX",48,32,4,5.0,4/12/2015,"Excellent service. We stopped in on A Sunday night at 5pm after MotoGP in Austin. They were slammed but the wait was still under 10 mins. Our server was friendly, bartender got drinks out quick and the manager came around to talk to us about the race. Our appetizer came out after the meal and he happily comped it.

Robert L.,"Cedar Hill, TX",0,22,,4.0,7/6/2015,"This was FANTASTIC service!!  We came with 13 and then the teens (5) abandoned us for Panda Express next door.  Losers!  The food was great, the atmosphere cozy, and the service was outstanding (and very patient when the teens arrived after the bill was paid and decided they wanted desserts to go).  We had been at Lost Pines Resort (where the food both days was just above room temperature) so a HOT meal was a nice change along with service that was on top of everything all the time (the opposite of Lost Pines)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bastrop?start=20

It is never as good as I remember as a child, but then again it was luxurious to eat out as a kid and now it is the norm and I do at least five times a week.

Marcy N.,"Seattle, WA",32,262,66,4.0,9/28/2012,The manager here was really super cool.  I don't remember the food being stand out or anything but I do know that he was super accomodating.  I met my cousin and her three little girls (all under the age of 4) for lunch.  The day was a super hot one.  We opted to wait outside in the car with the buzzer since the waiting area was full.  We didn't hear the buzzer go off but the manager came looking for us.  I had mentioned to him that we were waiting in the car because of the 3 little ones. Our lunch arrived very promptly which was great.  We enjoyed our salads.  Our server brought us drinks to go!   A lovely touch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bastrop?start=20

Grayson H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/10/2015,"The only reason I have returned is because it's the only place to eat besides fast food after Maxine's is closed. If Applebees sets up next to this Chili's in Bastrop, I guarantee you the customers will go there instead. This is because,  not once,  not twice, but 3 times IN A ROW the people at this location have brought me the wrong food. It's not just me either. I can hear people sitting behind me getting the same treatment too. I mean how hard is it to bring the customer what they ordered?  I'm not talking small things like forgetting to leave off the onions I'm talking bringing out the wrong entree all together. The part that insults me the most, is this last time they failed to bring me what I ordered,  I sent it back to the kitchen. Then, the manager comes back with the SAME plate and asks me if I would like to ""snack "" on it while they prepare the right entree. HELLO??  I SENT IT BACK FOR A REASON IDIOT. this is how the manager takes care of it I guess. I'm not even going to get into how he took care of my mother in law after they spilled ranch on her. This place is under piss poor management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bastrop?start=20
Jennifer F.,"Austin, TX",12,7,3,3.0,8/12/2013,"Normally have great food and service and we still had that today but at lunch we came in with our coupon for a free dessert and for some reason a particular bartender, Kelly, never let's us use the free app or dessert coupons when we order a lunch combo meal. Says that the cost of the free item is more expensive than the entrée so they won't accept it. There is nothing on that coupon that says a lunch entrée cannot be purchased. It has other specifics like you cannot order an appetizer as your meal, but nothing about the lunch combo. Other waiters have let us use it. I wouldn't mind if the rules on the coupon stated cannot be used at lunch or with lunch portions but she just pulls that stipulation out of nowhere so it angers me. And the lunch combo I ordered cost more than the dessert did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bastrop?start=20

Matthew K.,"Austin, TX",4,16,,4.0,4/7/2013,"Not my first time visiting this location, but definitely one of my better visits. It was a slow night, so we were sat and greeted quickly. I don't remember our servers name, but she was very polite and knowledgeable on the menu. Tied one of the margaritas, and was happy with how it turned out. The food took a little longer than expected, since the restaurant was slow. The food was okay, minus the new mac n cheese they added. The bread crumbs really dried it out. I suppose that's the only negative thing I can say, but its also what stands out the most. All in all, I will definitely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bastrop?start=20

Cindy C.,"Bastrop, TX",2,45,6,1.0,1/16/2012,"Today I found myself sitting in the last booth closest to the kitchen. I could see quite a bit of what takes place there. I saw a lot of hands on the food. It seemed mostly from the last person who finishes up the plate after it has left the cooks. They poor the brocoli out of a bag and then push it with their fingers so it looks nice. They touched the bread, fries and more. Wear some gloves please! Wait staff - do not touch the food.

I mean, pasta is yummy. Chili's is yummy. It seemed like a win/win. No/no. Neither was a win. The service wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. The waiter just seemed a little distracted. Maybe he had a hot date later and was distracted? Maybe he just didn't really give af? It's ok, I didn't really give af about the tip either, so it evened out. The food was lackluster. I get it, it's a Chili's, not a fine dining establishment, but we were sitting RIGHT BY the kitchen and our food was lukewarm. Did he take a detour? Maybe he was canoodling with his hot date; she or he had to be hotter than the food. I got the pasta and it was okay. I did not eat it all, and I was starving. I decided to carb up back at the hotel with some Fig Newtons. yes, i chose Fig Newtons over this mess of a pasta dish. It was the Chicken Alfredo one. The bread wasn't even that good. It was cold and dry. How do you mess up bread?!  I was just glad to get our dinner over with and get out of there. The only reason it got 2 stars is that it was in the hotel parking lot and we didn't have to drive.

Hayden H.,"Bastrop, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/24/2017,"This location of chili's has consistently been one of the worst chili's experiences I have ever had. Not because of the quality of the food, but the quality of the customer service. I have lived in Bastrop for two decades and have had to come to this establishment over the years due to family/work obligations and have consistently experienced rude hostesses and servers, but nothing has been so upsetting than a recent to go order my family placed. The order was placed over the phone, and when  my mother asked the employee to repeat the order he huffed and said he ""got it,"" but when he did repeat the order it was wrong. He was politely corrected. Later, when we went to pick up the order a woman from the kitchen shouted at us if we had been helped. When we said not yet, she found the man who had originally taken our order to finish the transaction. He then asked us ""which one of us ordered"" then proceeded to complain to my mother for asking him ""3 times"" if he had gotten the order right. Then he patronizingly showed my mother the display on the computer as proof while explaining to her that he had in fact gotten the order correct because in his mind, my mother was the one who has ordered incorrectly and he had done us a favor for correcting it. My mother and I both work in the service industry, and were appalled that someone representing service would act in such a condescending, immature, and rude manner towards a customer.
