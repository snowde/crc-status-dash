Tori M.,"Aurora, IL",360,148,127,4.0,1/2/2018,"I'm not huge into chain restaurants but on New Years Day, there aren't many choices. Luckily, we chose Chili's and weren't disappointed. The app made it super easy to order our to-go meal and it was ready right on time. The guy who rung me up was very peppy and friendly. We each got the chicken crispers although I went the crunchy route whereas my fiance stuck to the classic beer-battered chicken. He opted for 2 sides of fries which were crunchy but could've used more of that delicious seasoned salt. I got fries and onion rings but they were a little stingy on the fries. High demand, I guess. The avocado ranch was delicious! Our food wasn't super hot by the time we got home but that could've been the 15 minute car ride so I won't hold it against them. Our chips were fresh and plentiful and the skillet queso was as awesome as I remember it. As far as chains go, I'd say this place is A-OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Charles W.,"Chicago, IL",79,13,10,5.0,12/28/2017,I ordered the Mango-Chile Chicken and I was magical for me. Well prepared and tasty and delicious. The ambiance was nice also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Dave H.,"St. Charles, IL",0,3,,2.0,6/30/2017,"Very cold inside, bring a jacket.  Blowers for cold air going directly above tables, makes for eating miserable.   The potato soup has so much cheese in it, that you need a knife to eat the soup.  If you do not use the knife, the string of cheese of each bite will get on your clothing.  Go for any soup but Potato unless you really like messy cheesy soup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Martin H.,"Geneva, IL",44,39,3,3.0,4/23/2017,Food is very good. Wait staff is busy. Food took a long time early on a Sunday afternoon,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Michael S.,"Batavia, IL",0,1,,2.0,4/17/2017,Ordered Chili's To Go. Awful service. Barely even an apology for food that was ready 20 minutes after the designated pick up time. Food still tasted ok once we got it home although most was pretty cold.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Diane S.,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,7,,2.0,4/6/2017,"Terrible experience there tonight.  The waitress must have been new and not trained very well.  Had a burger...didn't ask how I wanted it cooked...came w/fries & forgot them.  When asked for them, she said she would be back...never came back w/fries, to check on our meal or refill our drinks.  Every empty table there (at least 6) when we left was piled with dirty dishes and needed to be bused. Very upsetting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Jen R.,"San Marcos, CA",51,237,12,4.0,7/11/2015,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this Chili's. Which is weird because... well, it's Chili's. We're not huge fans of nationwide restaurant chains but my husband got a gift card to here and we were hungry.  The food was good! It didn't taste microwaved or overly salty. Husband got the smokehouse burger, which was delicious (he let me have JUST ONE bite). I opted for the unlimited soup and salad. The salad was not just iceberg, which made me very happy. They got that ranch dressing on fleek. The chili was good  (needed lots of hot sauce) and the chicken enchilada soup was about as good as the worst thing you could get at Taco Bell. I couldn't finish it. We probably won't go again for a while, if ever, just because... well, it's Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Donnita S.,"West Chicago, IL",69,27,9,2.0,1/8/2017,Not as good as it used to be. Steak fajitas were tough and guacamole looked a little off color. Edible . Service was good and so were Texas fries. Hubby ate it. But we probably won't be coming back. .I was looking forward to the fajitas and we're let down by the portions and stuff steak and little shrimp.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Real S.,"DeKalb, IL",0,28,,1.0,11/13/2016,"I would give this negative stars if possible!!! We went there today 11/13/2016 at 3pm and the hostess asked how many , and was rude right off the get go. Didn't say ""hi"", or even ""welcome to chilis"". She was an older lady with blonde hair, looked like she absolutely hated the job. We told her 5 for our group, she responds ""hold on"" and leaves , never returns.... waited 10 min and left. Chilis is horrible now , we will never return",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Amanda D.,"North Aurora, IL",44,25,4,1.0,8/30/2015,"If I could give them ZERO stars I would. The service is horrible from being seated to the server. The server was not attentive at all. I ordered the margarita chex mex bowl and my husband ordered the original chicken crispers. I asked for no beans.....I got beans. The food tasted horrible, it was very greasy. Not even ten minutes after I left I was so sick to my stomach.  Prior to this experience I have not patronized a Chilis for months because I feel like the food choices are poor.  The service we always receive is poor and the good is never anything to remember. I do not recommend anyone to go to Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Nat W.,"Naperville, IL",0,18,,2.0,12/28/2015,I have been going to Chili's for years and always loved it. The 2 stars is for the server not the food.. Food is always great. We went here on a Sunday morning and God forbid you ask her any questions.. We sat in the bar and there were no other tables so it's not like she was so busy and had no time. Will still go to Chili's but not this one. Ditch the attitude!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Garrett H.,"Batavia, IL",1,2,1,1.0,5/5/2016,"Quite possibly the worst restaurant I've ever been to...server was nice but everything was terrible. Took 20 minutes to get water, tortilla chips looked like someone crushed them before they brought them out, waited 45+ mins for food then it came out over cooked. Tables around us were never cleared after people left, wait staff was no where to be found. Management should be embarrassed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Brad W.,"St Charles, IL",2,32,,1.0,12/1/2016,Wouldn't go back.   Service was barley ok.....had to ask for napkins and straws two and three times.  Food was lacking any taste and there are just so many other places to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Food C.,"North Aurora, IL",0,14,,4.0,8/25/2016,"This Chipotle franchise scores high on its cleanliness, friendliness of wait staff and food quality.  1) Went there on a Tuesday night, a good night for eating out. Server was nice and friendly guy, joking around and accommodating. Pleasant to interact with.  2) Owner (or manager) who was also working in the kitchen, was also on hand to help out with placing orders in case server got busy. Impressive !  3) Portions were good ! Clean, prepared and presented well, looked appetizing.  4) Server was generous to point out that it was ""kids eat free"" day. So our kid got a kiddo meal ! Lots of points for that.  5) Will recommend this franchise above other Chilis' in the area to friends and associates. Good marketing and sense of business, so far !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Stacey K.,"Batavia, IL",0,90,,3.0,1/6/2017,Has gone downhill except for the soup. Food not appetizing. Salsa tastes funky. Hostess is a total flake but servers seem good. Not enough seating- what's with the 2 person booths? Giving 3 stars for the mai tais and soup. Also I have used the football discount card for free chips and salsa.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Erin D.,"Geneva, IL",12,22,6,5.0,1/25/2016,They are over the top friendly and did everything to put my mind at ease and double checked that my son with a peanut Allergy was safe!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Ron W.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",29,54,2,1.0,12/31/2014,"Geri and I stopped by for lunch before going to the movies across the street.  We sat at the bar and received really bad service.  I ordered the ""Endless Soup & Salad"" which really means one salad and unless you stop the bartender you get nothing else. I paid the bill and the attempted to speak with the manager on duty and I could see where the attitude came from.  She said she was sorry and suggested that I keep coming back.  Not sure if she realized but bad service does not make me want to come back as there are other places to eat in that part of twin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Colleen L.,"Hopkins, MN",0,8,,2.0,3/29/2016,We had takeout tonight. My salad came with the wrong dressing so we had to drive back to get the correct honey lime dressing. The salad itself was good except they also left out the dried cranberries. Very disappointing. My husband had fries and a burger. That was good and his order was correct.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
F S.,"St. Charles, IL",0,9,,1.0,10/24/2015,"A horribly managed location this Chilis is! We have had very mediocre service here before but this takes the cake.  Me and the GF walk in and the teenage ""Hostess"" walks up and we decide to sit in the bar area in a booth the Hostess suggests.  Well we are sitting there for like 12 minutes and see no waitress in site.  Nobody at all has come up to us to say anything.  After a few more minutes a bored looking, not at all engaged blonde haired waitress walks by our table but she is doing her best to ignore us as she takes the bill from another table.  She just plods on by as we sit there.  Its been almost 15 minutes now without any service or acknowledgement.  Then a few more minutes go by and the waitress starts slowly picking up dishes from the table that just left the whole time not even a glance in our direction as we are looking at her. We are only maybe 15 feet away.  At this point we don't even want to be served if she ever came over, by this crumby excuse for a waitress so we get up and leave.  As we are leaving the Hostess sees us and I inform her we are leaving and will not be back as we sat there for almost 20 minutes without anybody even approaching our table.  The management is non existent here.  I guess Chilis is so profitable they can just let money walk right out the door.   To Chilis Corporate; this Chilis in Batavia IL. his hurting your brand...get a clue. We will not go to Chilis anymore and will share our experience beyond this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
Justin O.,"Wheaton, IL",0,9,,1.0,1/15/2016,Zero stars. They should just shut this place down. Food is fine. Service is terrible. I am here now and it took 45 minutes to get food and no one is even clearing off the dirty tables. There's like 8 tables its dirty plates and food on them. Not coming back to this one ever again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia
MG E.,"Westmont, IL",0,9,1,1.0,3/28/2015,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This is the worst Chilis I have ever been to. I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but for the convenience of them we take our family there occasionally. There are a bunch of teenagers running this place who have no idea what they are doing. What a waste of $70! Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
Daron R.,"Parker, CO",129,3,,1.0,10/10/2016,"Ordered food, went to pick up and saw it sitting there ready to be bagged.  Needless to say, people seemed very disorganized and I didn't pay too much attention to it although we ordered about 30 mins ago.  Got the food home, it was cold, the ""caramelized"" onions for the fajita's were obviously put in a pan for a minute or so and not seasoned.  Essentially raw onions.. and peppers for that matter.  We've ordered from there before and have had issues each time.  Thought give it another try....naw....no more...Whether eating there or ordering from there, there's always been a prob.  Unfortunate.  At least they have the brand name to rely on...this customer is no longer though. Extremely poorly managed.  The kitchen very disorganized and while I was waiting for my food I saw a waitress come in with a plate and a number of staff were looking at something on the plate that obviously shouldn't have been there.  I'm not a lip reader but I thought I saw an ""oh no"" and ""oh shit"".  I did call to let the manager know about the food and was credited 50% and told ""the cook was a little overwhelmed etc"".  Really!?  My pocket book was overwhelmed I just paid for this junk. They let this stuff out the door?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
RoxAnne T.,"Batavia, IL",70,17,2,1.0,9/5/2014,"Ugh. I told my husband from the parking lot we shouldn't go in because the food takes so long but he had a yen. So, we tried again. We were sat right away; we missed the rush by minutes.  We ordered right away to not get caught up in the rush.  Forty minutes later we asked to speak to a manager and told her we were leaving in 5 minutes if our food didn't come out.  Of course it came out right away then but had clearly been sitting. We could see the kitchen from our seat and it was absolute chaos.  By this time our kids were beyond restless so we ate fast and tried to rush out. Of course, even though we had complained,  the manager hadn't made any adjustments to the bill.  Just a reminder to us to not go back.  After the adjustment I insisted on and tip (it wasn't the waiters fault! ) It still cost almost $40 for two kids and 2 adults with no apps, no dessert. Ugh again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
Juli D.,"Elgin, IL",0,7,2,2.0,2/5/2015,"A review for a chain restaurant...don't you know what to expect from a place like Chili's? Yes. I expect decent food, decent service, leaving with the feeling that I overpaid a bit, but overall, satisfied.  I don't frequent these chain places but I know they are usually a safe bet.   We should have just eaten at the Sam's Club cafe and called it a night.  One of the stars is for those tablet things the kids can play with while we wait.  It was busier than I thought it would be on a Wednesday evening. Our food took forever to arrive.  My husband had the sirloin with grilled avocado.  He said it wad good.  The kids had chicken tenders and they were good.  One of my kids ordered the mashed potatoes from the kids' picture menu.  They arrived with cheese and bacon.  That kid hates cheese. The future lawyer in her pointed at the picture which showed plain mashed potatoes and said it lied.  I agreed,  but we didn't make a fuss.  She just ignored the potatoes.  I had the shrimp tacos. I love tacos. I love shrimp tacos. These were not good.  The shrimp was floppy and just had an awful texture.  I picked them out and just ate the slaw. Then one of my kids realized they never got their drinks.  When our server came around I told him the shrimp was gross and pointed to the pile on my plate. I mentioned that they never got the drinks,  but we didn't want them as we were done with our meal.  The server offered me another meal,  but I was Chili-ed out at this point.  He offered to talk to the manager,  and I agreed.   He said manager took half off my shrimp tacos ($5.50--wooo, but that's not even the point) but never came out to apologize.  That don't-give-a-shrimp attitude is what left a really bad taste in my mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
Brian P.,"Batavia, IL",78,12,,1.0,10/27/2015,Waited almost 45 minutes for the server to tell us that our food got pushed back because a plate spilled (which happened before we ordered) and the kitchen had to make that one first. Being in the industry I know when a server lies and makes up an excuse when he forgets to put an order in. Don't lie to your table and avoid them. Communicate to them and let them know your human and totally forgot. I would be more forgiving but now I'm just passed. Will not be back and only giving one star because there is no option for no stars,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
M K.,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,8,,5.0,10/30/2015,Haven't been to chili's in years. I was impressed with their menu options. I was looking for a different atmosphere and new food and glad I came here. Had Brett as a server as he was awesome! He kept getting me new beers WITHOUT ME HAVING TO ASK! and was sooooo friendly. Restaurant was clean as well! :) YES!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
D S.,"North Aurora, IL",0,8,,2.0,10/26/2015,"Nothing horrible.. Nothing exceptional.  The ""spicy"" Onion Rings were tasteless. The other food was bland at best.  If that's  what TexMex is, they better search for another market niche.   Average service.  Go across the street.. there's a better chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
Mark D.,"North Aurora, IL",0,6,4,1.0,8/30/2015,The worst service  i have had. The menu has changed and the food is terrible. My chicken was ice cold. Waitress never even checked on us.

Margaux D.,"Aurora, IL",157,143,129,3.0,2/19/2012,"Another steakhouse chain. This location isn't any different than any other Chili's I've been to. They've changed their menu a lot recently and they have these new receivers on every table that allow you to pay your bill and order on them. However, they never work and somehow these electronic waiters just don't do it for me. The one thing I can say about this Chili's is that the staff is attentive. I've had service at other locations where I've had to wait a lot longer for service.  Another note: If you're going to order a drink, be sure to have two forms of ID. Apparently this is a new law in Batavia because kids were stealing their relatives' ID's and using them to buy drinks. I've only been double-carded here, though. Bring a college ID or something I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
Kevin R.,"Algonquin, IL",59,10,,1.0,7/30/2014,"Chili's has been thoroughly disappointing to me lately. First off, the water both my girlfriend and I received had a very weird taste to it and I couldn't even stomach it. (Normally, I can stomach most things) Secondly,  the server we had really didn't seem all to interested in our table. She never cleared a single item the entire time and even left the mango iced tea on our table that my girlfriend told her she didnt because it was too sweet. We had no room on the table. Finally, we both got the fajitas and the chicken was DEFINITELY not chicken.  It was rubbery and over processed....almost gelatinous. Never going back here EVER AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
Sue N.,"Batavia, IL",0,3,,4.0,12/22/2014,I go to this place on a regular basis - if not for the food and the awesome margaritas - but for the staff!  I love Lindsey and Adam - they are the best......,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
Kersten R.,"Batavia, IL",123,22,5,1.0,10/30/2014,"Executive Management/owners should take a deep look into their food quality and staff lately. We live closeby and chilis has always been a go to place...in fact I don't mind waiting.... as long as the food is hot and good and if it is busy...good service always a plus and will be reflected in tip.  Today (thurs) my son and I came at noon...every chain around was packed with lunch bunch....not this place...dead as a door nail....no receptionist....waited for 15 minutes as my son kept saying lets just go....wise little man...we should have. Waitress (ended up being ours) was unapologetic and rude. Waited another 15 for her to take our order....again no one there. She finally took our order never to be seen from again. My son ordered kids meal pizza which tasted metallic and I ordered beef enchiladas which are usually awesome....not this time...brown, sickly, avocado on old-tasting, lukewarm food. Manager came over and was abrupt and said 'well u aren't paying for the kids meal anyway so why should it matter?!'

Mike M.,"St Charles, IL",1,14,3,2.0,6/20/2011,"I find it pointless to write reviews on corporate restaurants, because regardless of what input I have, it goes to naught.  Nevertheless, I have been a regular customer of various Chili's restaurants (and my wife was an employee of one) and I have always enjoyed the food as well as the service has always been to expectation.  But my first time at the Batavia location shall be my last.  After waiting patiently for 30 minutes for two sandwiches (noted: restaurant NOT BUSY), I come to find out from a manager that the bartender (my server) had neglected to ring in our food.  It was prompt after the issue came to light, but then when it came to getting refills on our tea, that never happened either.  Just an all around disappointment.  If I want Chili's, I'll waste the gas to avoid this location.  Or go across Randall to Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20
