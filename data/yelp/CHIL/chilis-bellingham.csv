Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565,5.0,11/15/2016,"Chili's in Bellingham has Friday nights down pat! They know exactly what they are doing, and are great at it. Specifically, Rose is amazing! She was my parties waitress a few weeks ago and was not only friendly, but did an excellent job not only with our table but with all of the tables she was taking care of on a busy Friday night. She was so friendly, kind, helpful, and efficient. Just phenomenal service throughout.  Another factor of why the Bellingham location is just so great, and 5-star worthy is because of the size. This is definitely the largest space I've ever seen a chain restaurant use. Between the large front area, the huge back room, the bar, and the outside seating, this place is huge. This results in not having a wait frequently, and having just more waitresses and waiters around.  The menu is constantly changing per season, one of the top reasons I like Chili's, and now it's probably my favorite restaurant chain, and the food is constantly well priced, a decent variety of the normal stuff with new things every so often. Chicken sandwiches and burgers are the standard for me at any Chili's location. The rewards system is pretty good (not as great as TGI Fridays, but still cool), and the management in Bellingham is just fantastic. I send their corporate office a compliment for Rose and for my entire experience in this restaurant, and they sent me a wonderful letter back and a gift certificate for my next visit. Supreme customer service too! I will definitely be coming back here in the future.  Located in the Charles River Center on Route 126 in Bellingham. 5 stars for this Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
Liz G.,"Hopedale, MA",0,16,1,1.0,12/7/2017,"I recently visited Chili's again after a very bad experience the last time we were there. Well I have to say in contrast to your commercials nothing much has changed. I had the chicken fajitas. What I was served was a undercooked white sponge sprinkled with pepper. I am not even sure it was chicken, it was completely inedible. The food was served on a platter with RUST on it. My friend got a burger. What you are supposed to be real good at. While the burger was cooked nicely it was flavorless and the grease on the bun could have been wrung out like a wet piece of clothing. Waste of time and money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
Erica T.,"Chicago, IL",0,29,6,2.0,4/23/2017,"Not even greeted when i came in nor after waiting at the bar as the bartender was doing nothing. I placed an order by phone at 1130am when it was empty.  No convenient To-Go Parking here.  Messed up my order, i only ordered one item to go, i had to go back. Fries were soggy, undercookes, and unseasoned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
W W.,"Framingham, MA",0,11,2,1.0,4/22/2017,"My husband and I used to love to go to Chili's when they were in Framingham so when we were over in Bellingham today we thought we'd go in for late lunch.  A man and 2 children entered before us and another couple came in after us. We were all standing near the entryway waiting for someone to notice 7 people. Finally a young guy with a filthy, dirty towel in his hands comes up and says ""Welcome to Chili's"" and asks the man if he needs children's menus (hint: he has 2 kids with him) then he takes the man and his children to sit down. Now I don't completely blame this guy for having a dirty towel in his hands because I'm thinking he was cleaning off tables and since no one else was concerning themselves with the fact that 7 new customers had just come in the door all at the same time, at least he came over to try and help....but it was kind of gross when you're thinking about eating there.  Next, it seemed to us that it was taking him a long time to come back,,,,,,,then the couple behind us decided to go over to the bar area and just seat themselves at a table??? Can you do that?? I guess so..... So, at that point we just decided to leave. We had no idea why there was no dedicated hostess and no one even noticed us leaving. The upside was it cost under $20 to grab something quickly over at Whole Foods and eat it there. It was very quick, efficient and affordable. We won't go back to this Chili's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
Peter M.,"Lowell, MA",115,9,,3.0,5/21/2017,"Came here for a quick meal on the way to an event nearby.  The Staff were friendly, and the food was good.  However, there was Slow service for a relatively quiet time - about 3:30/4 in the afternoon.  Not many people in the place but took too long for a couple burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
Brian A.,"Medway, MA",26,2,2,2.0,1/8/2017,"Not that busy but still had to wait for a table.  Chili was served but not really hot.  Then it took about 35 minutes for our meal to come out.  My ""fried"" tenders were cold.  Didn't complain, because I knew this would be the last time eat there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
San D.,"Franklin, MA",0,6,1,1.0,5/26/2017,"We came here due to sons birthday request and it was a bad call.  The waiter did not want to be there and his service was awful.  Will not be going to Chili's  in the future , great birthday fail !! After an hour the food had not arrived and we left , VERY BAD SERVICE !!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
Pual M.,"Hopedale, MA",7,150,75,3.0,11/20/2016,I haven't been to chili's since I was a young teen and I wasn't a fan so I haven't been back until recently. It was a more pleasant experience now based only on the food. The waiter was awful didn't right down are order for the six of us and when placing the order with the kitchen he returned to ask questions about are orders. The drinks sat for a long time before being refilled which is sad because there was only the six of us and one other couple in there for lunch. My friends food was all screwed up but mine was awesome! The portion size to price was good and I didn't leave feeling full like with alot of the chain restaurants. Will be back again hopefully with a different wait staff and will update.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
Coll W.,"Franklin, MA",3,32,5,2.0,5/3/2015,Worlds smallest piece of chicken.      Got the triple dipper. Chicken crispers super small pathetically so. Cheese bites are terrible just fried pieces of bread. Worse part being able to see right into the kitchen on the expo line and watch the expo pull her hair long black hair out of her ponytail play with it and put it back up and then continue to expo food without washing her hands.

Jade N.,"Bellingham, MA",427,28,5,2.0,3/30/2016,"Service is usually terrible & food is very inconsistent. Usually, cold/uncooked. The bean queso dip is watery & gross lately (when it usually doesnt come that way). Love the 2 for $20 though, i used to come quite often. Now we dont even bother. I ordered take out & received on accident what turned out to be chx/bacon quesadilla which was actually amazing. Tried to order it myself next time & it was disgusting.

Ron G.,"Springfield, MA",2,21,10,4.0,5/12/2015,"Typical Chili's, large menu, sports on tv with no sound.  I had a half rack of original ribs. Average size rack,  not a lot of meat on the bone. Tasty sweet bbq sauce. My partner gf had  spicy chicken pasta. Penne with a cheesy sauce, chicken had mild spice flavor with no kick to it. Her garlic bread was soft, not any crunch to it. Service was excellent, Gary was helpful explaining the menu items and altering our ice tea orders to taste. He was attentive but not intrusive during our meal. At 2 for $20, reasonably priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham

Cheryl H.,"Franklin, MA",0,4,,2.0,10/29/2016,"We are local family who visits at least twice monthly (theater next door & food and service have been ok), but takeout is always subpar.  Takeout order last night included cold soups, cold boneless wings, cold french fries, and cold, crunchy (like they were just sliced) fajita veggies.  Mgr Jennifer told me they ""only convect the veggies for 2min, 30 sec"" and ""what did I want her to do for me?""  Really??  I've worked all week & didn't want to cook tonight, but because your take out is a disaster and you want me to feel it's MY fault for ordering YOUR food, and it's cold & raining so I am not coming back for replacement food,  I put my boneless wings and fries in the toaster over, my soups in the microwave, and I cooked my own fajita veggies.  Nice!  Not the first time I've had issues with take out, BUT it IS the last.  Hey Chili's...if you cannot ensure the same quality for takeout as your dine-in menu, perhaps you should consider a limited take out menu?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham

Robin Y.,"Boston, MA",144,315,421,4.0,3/14/2015,"I hadn't been to a Chili's in probably ten years, but we were desperate for food later in the evening last week and decided to give it a go. We were actually pleasantly surprised by a number of things. First, they make fairly good guacamole and give you the option of having it made ""tableside,"" which was funny to us. Second, our waitress was great. Third, the food was pretty good. My husband was brave and ordered a steak, and I got a turkey burger--we were happy with both. I would probably come back were I craving Southwestern-ish food and a beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
T B.,"Marlborough, MA",0,18,,1.0,12/28/2012,"This Chili's just installed a conveyor belt to cook the food. The quality is awful. I had the fajita trio and the shrimp were white with no color at all. The chicken looked liked it was precooked and out of a bag, microwaved. I have eaten Chili's fajita for many years and won't have another. They finally made McDonald's look good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
Andrew P.,"Bellingham, MA",0,6,,1.0,9/1/2015,"Terrible, don't bother. My wife and i waited for over 5 mins on a slow, off hours night for somebody to come to the front and seat us. Then we waited another 10 mins while waitresses walled past us. Nobody bothered to give is the slightest bit of attention.  Again, there was nobody there, a few people at the bar and that's it. We were hungry so we just left and went else where, i don't think it's unreasonable to expect at least a drink after 15 min's waiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
Isabel F.,"Torrance, CA",158,191,243,1.0,1/10/2010,"I've been putting off writing my review of Chili's because honestly it's an experience I want to forget.  Let me start by saying the place is extremely clean, I was a bit shocked at first with their level of cleanliness. Being a clean freak this restaurants cleanliness exceeded my expectations.  There were about three or four other parties eating, when we sat down and waited for our server. As soon as our server approach our table, we got a whiff of cigarette smoke. I really wanted to look past this incident and still have an enjoyable lunch. However when you can smell your server before she approaches your table, it's a bad sign.  My cousin and I both ordered the fajitas Trio, which come with steak, chicken and shrimp. My cousin added a side order of beans and rice, while I had a side order of guacamole. Our food arrived within a reasonable time period. However, once we started to eat the fajitas we noticed that first the shrimp, were chewy and burnt. The chicken had no taste whatsoever and finally our steak was just plain gross. It was tough and a bit slimy. When we noticed this we immediately wanted to find our waiter and tell her about our food. However, we were unable to find her or any Chili's employee for that matter. After a couple of minutes, we gave up and decided to write a letter to Chili's corporate instead.  We came to the conclusion that our waiter was taking her smoke break because when she finally stopped by our table to drop off our bill, the stench of smoke the preceded her was stronger.    When she finally arrived to check up on us, she asked about our food and we told her the meats were tough and burned but she didn't seem to care and simply dropped off our bill and left.  BAD SERVICE, HORRIBLE FOOD. Honestly you'd be better off going to McDonald's for lunch; at least there they have a level of food quality that they uphold.  P.S. Once we paid our bill, we ended up getting a customer survey. I took the survey and gave Chili's a piece of my mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham
Patty C.,"Bellingham, MA",0,6,,1.0,5/24/2016,"I went there today with 2 others. I ordered the baby back ribs and they were lousy, All bone, little meat and lots of chewy fat. The photo of the ribs on the menu looked great. That is NOT what I got. The chef threw my fries on top of my ribs. If I wanted my side of French fries doused in BBQ sauce, I would have done that myself. The menu showed them separate.. My son ordered the Chicken Quesedillas, they came without the Ranch dipping sauce that was promised on the menu. By the time the sauce came, the Quesedillas were cold and lousy. Our young lady ordered the sirloin with garlic butter. It came plain, sans the garlic butter. When she asked for the garlic butter, the wait person was miffed and insisted it was cooked with it. It definitely was not. Not a great experience and I would not be writing this had it not been the third time I have had a bad experience at Chili's in Bellingham. I will not go back. Third time was not a charm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham?start=20
Taco E.,"Framingham, MA",5,63,5,2.0,3/19/2012,"It's always a hit or miss at Chilis. Food is usually consistent, as well as my needing a bathroom ASAP after I eat at Chilis.

Jennifer E.,"Merrimack, NH",282,614,166,4.0,5/23/2011,"There aren't too many chains in the area that I live in (Mendon), which is fine by me considering that I prefer local restaurants usually.  I always find chili's to be a good fall back if I'm just feeling like something casual and not too expensive.  The chili's in Bellingham always provides good service and the staff is always very friendly.  It's a good stop if I'm in the mood for dinner (always go for the 2 for 20$ deal) or for a beer before a movie at the next door Regal (bud light is 1.99$).  They have a pretty good selection of beers on draft, including some local favorites from Wachusett and Harpoon.  For a chain, this particular Chili's always provides a pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham?start=20
Sydney Z.,"Franklin, MA",0,5,,2.0,12/20/2014,"I go to Chili's fairly often, and the only reason they are getting a two is because their food is good, and I have had good experiences in the past.  The last time I went there, which is also the last time I will ever go there, my friends and I only went because we wanted the molten chocolate lave cake, which is delicious, there is no denying that.  However, the waitress did not even offer us dessert when we concluded our meal, and then when we asked for some after receiving our check she finally said yes.  She then gave us the two desserts we ordered (the second was a hot cookie sunday) in to-go containers, still frozen.  Now, I understand that it was getting late and the workers probably wanted to close-up shop, however, I do not believe this should be a valid excuse for her action.  We did not realize until we had left that they were not heated what so ever, or we would certainly not have tipped so generously.  Chili's food is good, but I would recommend going to a different one besides this particular location if you want actual service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham?start=20
Jesse B.,"Aurora, IL",1,44,,3.0,7/30/2011,"I ate at this location tonight.  Food was great but the service wasn't anything to write home about.  She kept forgetting to bring stuff that was asked for.  My fiancee asked for water and she came over to our table from the kitchen with only a straw and was like oops. I had the honey chipotle chicken crispers that were excellent.  My fiancee had chicken club quesadillas and enjoyed them as well.  The chips in our appetizer were thin and broke a lot, making dipping them a pain in the ass. I've had better experiences at other Chili's locations, so hopefully this was a one time thing or at least just this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham?start=20
Matthew D.,"Blackstone, MA",2,24,,4.0,7/13/2010,"Have to agree with Jill here, that one is a little rough. I have been here probably 3 or 4 times and was mildly pleased every time time. I am a very picky eater, so the one thing that made this restaurant lose a star for me was the selection. They don't order any seafood except shrimp, which can't make a whole meal IMO.  Other than that, the food was very good. I usually get a burger which is cooked exactly the way I want it every time and my girlfriend likes their signature chicken strip dish. The only reason I don't get that every time, is because I know I can steal hers :) Service is usually good, but sometimes Staff is few and far between. Food comes quickly. Definitely a 4 out of 5 star restaurant. Not a 1/5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham?start=20

Punam D.,"London, United Kingdom",134,316,9,1.0,4/20/2013,"Came here for lunch today. It's set out like TGI Friday's, with booths and tables and 50's-type decor. The best thing about this place was the 90's music. We started with the tostada chips with salsa and corn guacamole. Chili's manages to make everything tasteless, which must be quite challenging. Next I had the margarita grilled chicken, which is where things got a bit weird. The chicken looked like breast but in fact was some kind of reconstituted meat, which was alarmingly uniform with no texture. Essentially it resembled a block of processed cheese. The 'chicken' came with rice and beans and a few bits of chopped tomato. Again nothing had any taste until I smothered it in salt, pepper and tabasco. My companion had the chicken fajitas; same story with the re-formed chicken, but the whole dish was disgustingly greasy from the fried onions. I had a classic margarita (I know, what a lush, and at lunchtime too!) which came is a cute little shaker. The drink was okay, albeit a bit sweet. Our server was helpful and attentive, although nothing about the experience would make me want to go back, ever. It's a shame, as I remember Chili's from way back when they had a massive restaurant in the centre of Reading in England. They used to serve good catfish and enchiladas. Apparently they have done a great job dumbing down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham?start=20
Ronnie G.,"East Greenwich, RI",0,7,,1.0,1/25/2014,"Terrible, terrible. If ever a place could epitomize poor service, this branch of Chili's wins the medal. Thirty minutes waiting for our take-out order, AFTER the scheduled pick-up time. This place is in chaos, and if that's the panic they need for take-out, god only knows what the diners are getting! If you ask about the order, you're greeted with blank stares, and ""you'll need to talk to someone else"". Crazy. Beware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham?start=20
Lily H.,"Mendon, MA",0,26,,4.0,5/10/2011,"Chili's is consistently good food for the money.  I have never had a bad experience here.  Friendly servers, good food, nice ambiance.  It is in a great location right off the 495 and a stones throw from the movie theatre which makes it all awful convenient.  I enjoy their fajitas every time, my husband orders the burger which is always cooked perfectly and he is a stickler for properly cooked meat.  If he orders a medium well hamburger, then it darn well better come to the table a medium well or the tip o meter goes down from there.  Also, the servers always stay on top of the drink refills....another pet peeve is when you have to flag down a server to refill your iced tea.  Never here.  Great kids menu with a lot to choose from.  Good all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bellingham?start=20
Amberlin R.,"Franklin, MA",1,52,,3.0,10/30/2010,"I gave this Chili's 3 stars in comparison to other Chili's.  It's not the best, but it's not the worst.  I've gone here a few times because it's so darn close to home, and it's location next to the movie theater is really convenient for dates.  I do feel like their menu is slim at best and on any given night they're out of at least two of the most popular items.  The bar service is good though.
