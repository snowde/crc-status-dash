Patrick G.,"Massapequa, NY",4,71,123,3.0,12/31/2017,"Gina may be our favorite bartender in the area, so the bar at Chili's has become a regular stop for the Mrs. and I to snack and have a few cold ones. No Michelin stars for the kitchen, but they do a few things well. The chicken crispers and burgers are solid, and we love the cheddar bites, and mexican egg rolls.  Decent food, and outstanding service (at least at the bar) mean we visit a couple of times a month.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Kristy R.,"New York, NY",368,1402,155,3.0,8/21/2017,"The only reason to come to Chili's is the 2-for-1 beers. Apparently this is an all-day/all-night thing? Other than that, Chili's is and always will be a typical chain restaurant. I have never ordered a meal here. I have only ever ordered beer and apps. Once in a while the beer tastes off. The apps are always so-so. Service is friendly and occasionally they forget something you ordered.  They do have those nifty tablets at each table, though! Pay without any further human interaction, that's kind of cool!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Jatin K.,"Plainview, NY",290,63,221,5.0,1/11/2018,"Okay so I know what you're thinking. 5 stars for chili's? How is that possible? Now this is a spot I've come to many many times however this particular visit pushed them from 3/4 stars into 5. They have expanded their menu, their food was insanely fresh this time and the service was incredible. We ordered our appetizers that came out in a timely manner, our drinks were replenished without having to ask. Bill and Kevin were both our waiters and did an amazing job. We had the fajitas, their new crisper and waffles and their smoke house combo which included ribs, sausage and chicken. Everything was extremely fresh and delicious. Yes it's chili's but hey this time they really really went out of their way to please. The service and food today will deff make me continue to come to chili's extremely often. Request bill and or Kevin as your waiters as they did a great job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Jack T.,"East Meadow, NY",0,7,,1.0,9/7/2017,"For starters, I don't like the kiosks on the table, it takes away from the personal service that we go to restaurants for. They sat us in the back with a full view inside the kitchen, and when I see paper and garbage on the floor, it totally repulsed me. The service was not that great, the waiter seemed like he was in the Twilight Zone, and my son commented that he saw him bite his nails. Ewwwww!!! They used to be good, but just like pretty much every other corporate restaurant, their food and service have gone completely downhill. Never going to another Chili's ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Jc B.,"West Babylon, NY",244,71,126,3.0,1/30/2017,Ok so many people rave about chilis im just left unsatisfied.  It was an immediate seating on a Saturday night so I think we just got there in time. They use a two server per table system which is pretty interesting as to give the best service.  Ordered guacamole and cheese curds for an app. And the two nephews meals were put in as well. The kids meals came out before apps. I was ok with that. Real corn on the cob is ruined by microwaved Mac and cheese. Places really need to switch away from this type for kids. The other kids meal a corn dog and fries. Not bad.  So now the guacamole comes and they do it right next to the table. Everything in a huge bowl and the waiter asks if you want it chunky or smooth. And mixes it table side. Nice and fresh. The fried cheese curds  came with a spicy ranch but tasted fine in their own.  The waiters were on point and laughed when I asked for two cokes to save them time. Being in the industry I know what would help out. They were great servers.  Unfortunately my dinner came. The mashed potatoes although made from real potatoes were extremely bland even with bacon cheese and sour cream. The corn niblets were bland except for the taste of fish yea they tasted fishy. I got a rib eye I love rib eyes. And I love medium rare. The steak was apparently to thin to get it cooked that way. And again very very bland. I put salt pepper and a little ketchup to get some sort of flavor but I got nothing.  I feel that chilis kills it on apps and then loses it on entree.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
T C.,"New York, NY",0,5,,4.0,10/10/2017,"I placed my ordered through the app. Unfortunately, just like my last few times ordering, a part of the order missing. No sauce this time. I'm glad I double checked, I just don't think the bartender cared enough to look in the bag. Food was good, I do recommend Chili's, just double check your order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Bonnie B.,"Hicksville, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/10/2017,"We came here at 2:30 on a Sunday and it wasn't packed at all. We were standing by the waiting area and wanted to be seated but the people in front of us was waiting for a table for a party of 16. Therefore, none of the staff came to seat us and we were a party of 3. There were many booths open and it was like we were invisible! After about 15 minutes of waiting, more people came in and was able to catch a waitress and ask how long to be seated. She had an attitude and said they are busy setting up for the large party. Well, we left! Horrible.. all the workers just passed us by and said nothing! They were moving really slow and didn't care who was waiting. We went to Applebees instead and the food and service was awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Jovanna T.,"West Babylon, NY",50,118,150,4.0,3/21/2016,"Admittedly I've never dined in this location; however, my co-workers and I order their food to go pretty frequently. I like this Chili's a lot because they've never gotten our orders wrong, and whoever has taken my phone order was patient and kind. I usually go with their shredded chicken enchiladas, but I recently tried a burger. I ordered the burger to be cooked Medium and it was perfect! Any time I have placed my To Go order it was ready for me when I arrived and still nice and warm when I got to work. The parking lot is spacious with parking on both sides of the building. It's on Hempstead Turnpike just off of the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway but you have to make a U-Turn to get there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Michael S.,"Plainview, NY",16,60,28,3.0,3/19/2017,"My wife,my daughter and I stopped in for lunch on a rainy Saturday.  Friendly staff and fair service.  Restaurant was quiet compared to dinner service.  Portion sizes are above average and they brought my daughter's meal out first as requested.  We were not in a rush so the speed that our drinks and meals were brought out was acceptable.  Not our first time here.  Everything is consistent from time to time so we will return because we know what to expect.  If you need to be done quickly, I recommend you state that to your server from the start.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Mike C.,"Long Island, NY",59,354,44,4.0,9/10/2016,"We all know Chilis isn't high end dining... It's a chain restaurant that offers a casual, no frills environment. It's just a grab and go spot, however for what it is, it's great.  I hadn't been to Chilis in years and I didn't realize it but I missed it. I like the casual vibe here and I really like the food (burgers, chicken sandwiches, guacamole, tacos...). The options are vast and the execution is done right.  Sure I could do without the sticky seats and the 2 for 1 beer crowds but it comes with the territory.  My chicken bacon avocado sandwich made up for all the short comings. If you are in the mood for a low key Tex-Mex/American lunch, consider Chilis. It hits the spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Vanessa B.,"Queens, New York, NY",114,17,14,1.0,11/7/2017,"This was by far the worst chili's I've ever been to! The ""smoked"" wings were disgusting. As soon as I took one bite, I was asking my fiancé if he thought they were cooked all the way through because it didn't look that to me and On top of that, they were very greasy and they were brought out without any blue cheese or sauce. Who wants wings without sauce or blue cheese? I also ordered the ancho salmon, which I get all of the time from other chili's establishments and this came out terrible too. The salmon was ok, I think they just put too much sauce on top ( I guess they had to redeem themselves for the sauce less ""smoked"" wings I ordered previously) and the rice portion wasn't the typical ratio it should be. It was barely any rice on the plate. My fiancé got ""sizzling"" chicken fajitas but the plate must've been exhausted because it wasnt actually sizzling. it was making the sizzling sound but no smoke lmao. Chicken was cold and the peppers weren't cooked. To top it all off, two dead fruit flies were in my wine... awesome! If you need something quick around this area, go to Applebee's or a local pub. Yuck!!!!! Some of the staff members were nice tho lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Ya S.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,201,419,4.0,7/12/2017,"Although I am not a fan of giant restaurant chains I was quite surprised by Chilli's. Great service, good food and the prices are unbelievable to be honest. For one - Happy Hour is apparently all day is 2 for 1 for selected drinks. I got Margaritas and let me tell you they were nice and strong surprisingly for a happy hour special. The food was great as well, no complaints. Will definitely consider this place for a lunch option again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage

Nick D.,"Jericho, NY",0,13,34,4.0,5/27/2017,"Came here for the new 3 course menu deal for $10 per person. It was a fantastic deal!  We were seated quickly at a booth. Server was great and very attentive. I got the blue moon beer which was 2 for 1 special however the glasses are smaller than typical.  2 of us had the salad to start while one had the nachos and salsa.  The nachos were very thin and crisp and hot out of the oven. We quickly devoured the huge basket. For the main entre, 2 had the chicken fajita and 1 had a colossal burger and fries. The burger was juicy and the chicken was extremely tender and well seasoned. Next we all got our own personal chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream on top. This was the bomb and highlight of the meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage

Mary Jane S.,"New York, NY",0,2,1,1.0,3/7/2017,"I've had by far the worst experience at Chilis.    I will never go back here again!!   First off , I order a Long Island Ice Tea, and I get my drink.!   As I am sipping it , I notice a dead fly in my drink,   And so they take the drink back.   Obviously , they ask me if I want something else to drink, So I say a Sprite I guess , so I can clearly see inside the cup!    I thought ,okay it happens and give it another try!      So, the bill comes, and they actually charged me for the soda, I mean, there's no common courtesy, I explain to the manager DJ about the situation , sarcastically he says "" ok, thank you,""   Walks away and never returns,    I mean nice , real nice  way to treat customers.  Then Nick ,the waiter sarcastically kept saying ""have a nice day, enjoy ur day being real sarcastic!  I mean, the servers were terrible, really inconsiderate and discourteous people!    I will never return!    They could care less about their customers!   Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Laurie M.,"Melville, NY",143,32,30,1.0,11/7/2016,"I placed an order on Sunday, November 6th at 5:51pm via phone as the online application said that ""one or more of the items I selected was unavailable at this location, please call the store"". I successfully placed the same order on the phone and the order taker told me 15-20 minutes. I get to the store surprised to see many cars on the to-go side. I walk in to the small To-go area where I see a decent amount of people waiting. The cashier, which I later found out to be a manager, was quick to make sure she got everyone addressed and paid for. While waiting I noticed a lot of yelling coming from the kitchen such as items having to be re-fired because this is ""old"" and I can't serve this and or confusions about orders. The kitchen area in the back is somewhat open so you can see into it when waiting. I noticed pieces of food and other garbage on the floor. When the cashier couldn't find some orders I noticed she asks several times to several people if they placed their order over the phone or online. Orders for people ahead of me were eventually resolved and people left. At this time it's now 40 minutes in to when I placed my order and there's 3 of us left waiting for our orders. She asked one gentleman twice and another server asked what his name was and what he was waiting for. He seemed to be getting annoyed by the wait as well. I then asked if she could check on my food because it is now 45 minutes past when I placed my order (if I didn't already pay for my meal I would have walked out at this point). She said the gentleman came in before me and my order would be out right after his, but I know this not to be true because several people came in after me and and left before me. So 50 minutes go by and another person brings out my over stuffed bag and kind of throws it on the counter, asks if it's mine and walks away. I take a look in the bag to see no silverware and food on the bottom of the containers so I ask for another bag to separate so the food doesn't spill in my car. I quickly rearranged the food and left to go home. On the way home I was kind of shocked that during my visit of being in the restaurant for 40 minutes longer than I was promised, I wasn't offered anything or apologized to for the long wait- Not even a glass of water. So, I live 1.3 miles from the restaurant. I open the boxes with my mother and father to notice that the food is ICE cold. Even if the food was prepared while I was waiting it certainly wasn't sitting on any warmers or anything. The cheese on the burger seemed to be completely melted into the burger almost to the point where it looked like there was no cheese on it. The burger was over cooked. My father got half a rack of ribs which was so small he made a joke ""this must have been a tiny pig"". The cheese fries were solidified together and the sauce opened on the quesadilla so it was soaked in whatever sauce was included, again with the cheese being hard. My fresco salad and chicken both came with the ""standard"" sauces even though I asked for different ones. Over all, I think this was a unfortunate experience as we're close to Chili's and visit quite regularly, I don't know if we'd be returning anytime soon. The service and the quality of the food are not even close to what we're used to when visiting this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage
Doc G.,"Little Neck, NY",0,8,,2.0,5/8/2017,"One and done with this place. 35 minutes for an appetizer, the chicken breast on my salad was cold after waiting an hour for the entree to come out.  Could not wait to leave, however the machine at our table was broken and had to wait for the bill.

Bryan M.,"Massapequa, NY",0,3,,2.0,5/1/2017,The waiter was very nice but the host was a complete idiot.

Jeanine Z.,"Levittown, NY",0,17,1,2.0,2/11/2017,"Terrible service last night. Basically after our dinner and drink order was taken, we never saw the waiter again. Had to go to empty table in front just to score a bottle of ketchup. I ordered the new smokehouse combo and was very disappointed. Came out cold and was not worth the money. Not enjoyable. But since we didn't see waiter, had no one to tell in order to get something else. So I just ate my chips and salsa and paid my bill for good that was not good. I like Chilis but this location has poor service on several occasions. Time to look for another place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=20
Kristina D.,"Bay Shore, NY",103,3,,1.0,2/22/2017,"Not sure where to begin but every time I try and come to this place, it's packed. Sounds good right? No. They are only packed because they are consecutively understaffed. 10 open tables but a 30 minute wait at the door is unacceptable. Hosts literally told a customer that he can't be sat because there is a party of 20 so they aren't sitting anymore tables in that section. That's pretty ridiculous. Learn how to staff your store.

Ariel R.,"Woodbury, NY",68,46,1,4.0,10/29/2015,"This is my favorite local restaurant.  Sure its a chain but on Long Island I have found you are better off sticking to a chain restaurant rather than gamble on some independent - at least for a cheap meal.  Now, each Chilis is different so I don't recommend all of them.  If you got bucks, go to a good restaurant and maybe you will get a good meal, but if you are on a budget like me and want to feed your family, you can't go wrong here.   I particularly like the fajitas which are almost always good.  Chicken and steak fajitas are good.  Shrimp too.  The Margarita grilled chicken is good too if you are not that hungry.  Also, the 2 for one Margaritas are great!. We always order 2 rounds though so it really becomes 2 for me and 2 for you.  Deserts are good too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=20

Dont get me wrong it was a Friday night I knew it wasnt going to be ready at that exact time. But when I stand there for almost 40 mins past the time the email instructed it gets alittle old. The girl behind the counter looked so scared to deal with anyone, let alone speak with anyone that was questioning the status of their take out.

Christopher C.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",255,124,75,4.0,2/22/2013,"I gotta say this is one of my favorite chain restaurants.  I come here all the time and am rarely, if ever disapointed.  First off, when you come to a place like chilis you gotta know what to expect, your not gonna have the best meal you ever had in your life, the food is not gonna be of a superior quality, but its gonna be damn good and hit the spot.  My usual go to appetizer at chilis is the classic nachos with extra jalapenos.  Its about 10 tortilla chips with beans, queso, and melted cheese served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  So good! The last time I was there I wanted to try something new so I went with the jumbo soft pretzels. They were fresh, soft and served with a delicious cheese sauce. For the entree i usually go with the steak fajitas which I usually eat without the tortillas.  They come out steaming hot with peppers and onions, and sides of sour cream, guacomole, cheese and tomatoes.  The last time I was there I was in the mood for the spicy shrimp tacos.  They give you three tacos with grilled shrimp, cilantro lime slaw, avocados, and pico de gallo with a spicy chile lime sauce.  It was great, hit the spot with just enough spice. Now as far as dessert I usually dont get it because I'm usually on my 6th or 8th beer by now, considering there 2 for 1, another great thing about chilis. All day everyday!!. But this last time I had the chocolate chip cookie skillet which basicall is a large fresshly baked cjocolate chip cookie with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on it.  Yes, I was in heaven it was fantastic.  Yes, a very simple dessert but damn, it was great. I left Chilis a very happy man. Thank you chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=20
Katie H.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1212,687,492,4.0,5/13/2013,"Honestly, I really believe that Chili's is different from most chain restaurants. I like their food a lot. Overall, I have never had a bad experience here and the staff is very friendly and willing to go the extra mile. I went right before Cinco De Mayo (I was craving a margarita soo badly) and I couldn't decide on what flavor to get for my ""El Presidente"" rita and the waitress was kind enough to give us flavor samples. She also got us extra chips too. Some of the drinks are 2fers or BOGO, which is a sweet deal.  I love the 2 for $20 menu and whenever I go out with friends we usually pair up and get that. My main go-to dishes are the chicken fajitas or the chicken quesadillas. They're always piping hot and delicious. I love getting the chips (they're very addicting). Chili's is a really social place for people of all ages. It's good for a hangout, date, family time, etc. And as for the drinks, the El Presidente is one heck of a killa'. Be warned... super tasty but the top shelf tequila creeps up on you quickly. The sunrise one is really good too. Very fruity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=20
Vinessa L.,"Portsmouth, NH",93,171,54,4.0,1/6/2013,"We've been coming to this Chili's for years and never had a problem here.  The food is always good.  My only complaint is that Chili's as a whole needs to get some vegetarian dishes, not just their one option of having a bean burger substitute or past dish minus the chicken.  There is no reason why they can't add some vegetarian options when they have so many choices on their menu that cater to meat eaters.   That said I have had their cajun pasta (minus the chicken or shrimp option) several times and their mushroom swiss burger with a black bean burger substituted.  Their mozzarella sticks (sorry I refuse to call it ""fried cheese"" as some places are now referring to it!) are always good as is their spinach artichoke dip!

What I had pictured in my head when I ordered, was far different from what I was served on my plate. The foul looking dish they served me tasted like something unholy. It couldn't have been from any animal I've ever tasted before. Threw my entire meal away in disgust. I was with a group of 5-6 people, they all tried it - and the looks on their faces were worth 1,000 words as they looked for anything to remove the hellish taste from their mouths.

While it is not super fancy (it is a chain after all) everything I have ever had has been delicious and I have never once had to send anything back. There are always deals going on (i.e. 2 for $20) so you can eat without breaking the bank.

April N.,"Massapequa Park, NY",108,20,,2.0,10/5/2015,"I like the food here and the margaritas are awesome, but I had a pretty lousy takeout experience recently. I ordered online to-go, and called to add an additional item around the time my order was supposed to be ready. Well, they said 13 minutes and it still wasn't ready after 20. Got to my car and checked the receipt to make sure everything was there and it was. Yet, I had a feeling I should check the bag. Turns out the last item I added didn't make it to the bag but they definitely charged me for it. So I went in and was given a little attitude from the bartender when I said I had a missing item. At least I got a ""sorry about that"" when I was handed the missing food. Sigh... maybe the Farmingdale location can do better. Also, Chilis, your mugs are nasty and are ALWAYS dirty.

Great  bunch of people working there. The food is always perfect...the service is excellent!! And it's a great value!

Taryn C.,"New York, NY",261,704,20,3.0,8/31/2011,"I am from the 'burbs and therefore I have an unusual fascination and attachment to chain restaurants.  Chili's is a place I usually find very consistent from all their chains, with the exception of a few establishments.  There was one in Jersey City that I panned, and this one falls into ""just okay"" spectrum of Chili's.  Let's be honest: you know what you are going to get.  But I was a little thrown off by the cleanliness of this establishment.  The bar area connects right with the kitchen and it never quite feels ""clean"" enough.  I don't know if this has to do with how long this place has been in operation but it might need a makeover or a power cleaning.  The bathrooms are never quite tidy enough either.  When I'm out dining, I expect a little more mode of cleanliness than I get here. Otherwise, as far as Chili's go, it's pretty good.  They always make my Presidente margaritas just right.  Their salads are a little less desirable than their platters.  But the staff is always SUPER nice whenever I visit, which is usually when I'm visiting my friend who lives out in this area.  I end up here usually since I am a chain restaurant junkie, but perhaps next time I'll try another place to see if the clean problem is just theirs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=40

Nothing wows you on the menu and there's really no draw to chili's. The honey chipotle chicken crispers are pretty good and the chicken Mex bowl thing isn't bad, there are a multitude of restaurants I would go to before chili's but in pinch for food it can be passable at worst and okay at best.

Jeanette E.,"Levittown, NY",12,35,16,5.0,5/6/2013,"UPDATE 3/25/14 - I'm very happy to update my review.  This place has more than redeemed itself over the last few months as far as I'm concerned.  This place has been on point with their food and service.  Chili's rocks! It pains me to give a bad review to a Chili's restaurant.  I really love the food and the atmosphere, but service is a huge deal to me and this place has gone way downhill in that department.  I've attempted to call-ahead numerous times, and each time I've been told I don't need to put my name on the call-ahead list because there is no wait. Even when I say I'd really like to have my name on, they insist there is absolutely no one waiting and there is no reason for it. It seems that in the 5-minute drive from my house, hoards of customers have arrived each time this has happened, and our wait is 20-30 minutes.  In my former life I wouldn't have cared, but dining out with a 1-year-old has changed my dining-out experience.  Part of the reason I like coming to Chili's is that it's a kid-friendly atmosphere and I feel comfortable if he's a little noisy.  But after waiting 30 minutes just for a table, he's usually a mess by the time our food comes, and it's a horrible experience for me and the other patrons around me which is unfair to everyone.  It's too bad because especially with a young child, dining out can be such a relief and a fun experience.  Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case here for us lately.  I don't think I'll be dining here again for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=40

This location makes you wait for 20 minutes when they have several tables open. Additionally, there are tables waiting to be cleared. Those tables took a long time for a buss person to clean them off. The manager on duty walked past the dirty tables several times but did nothing about it.

Someone who loves me , please smack me for my laziness in choosing  the local dopey chain place instead of seeking something a little better!!! I'm not a food snob as anyone can see.  I mean , shit, I seriously like Popeye's fried chicken!  Having said that, the food was ok but  no love was going into your plate.  Try desperation and panic more like it! lol We were seated promptly and our orders were taken quickly.  But for whatever reason, our simple order of a burger & cheesesteak took forever.  When it arrived my bacon cheeseburger had burnt bacon, burnt roll , and maybe 1o fries.  The cheesesteak  sandwich came out as sliders instead of a sandwich with the same lack of fries.  I didn't send the burger back , but we sent the cheesesteak sliders back because they looked lame.  I mentioned to our server about the fries and she did promptly send a basket of fries over, gratis.  When the cheesesteak arrived, it lacked cheese and onions& peppers and was a soggy mess.  Not in a fun way , either.  We also ordered nachos and they were tasty.  The best part of the meal , actually.
