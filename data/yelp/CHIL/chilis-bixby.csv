Priya M.,"Riverside, CA",98,109,432,5.0,10/5/2017,"Intimate family dinner, so I didn't take pictures.  [Food] -Chips and salsa: the salsa is soooooooo delicious!!! Perfect balance of spiciness. I would come back here just for the salsa.  - side of Gucamole: yumm!!! - Mango Chile chicken: less then 500 calories and filled with so much flavor! This dish has become my new favorite at Chillis. Comes with side of broccoli and Mexican rice. Very filling.  Customer service was also great here. Our waitress made sure our chips salsa was refilled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Kyle S.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,2,12,2.0,8/12/2017,Bad service. Good food though. Had to ask twice for our chips and salsa and still waited a good 15 minutes just to get it. I think our waitress flew to Jamaica after we ordered. She was nice enough but kinda complacent. I'm not sure why we waited so long there was hardly anyone dining there. We ordered the 2 for 22 deal and the waitress rang it up separately and over charged us by 8 bucks. Ended up needing congressional approval to correct the price on the bill and get change.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Cheri S.,"Tulsa, OK",74,51,40,1.0,6/12/2017,"You know something that annoys me? Seeing a national commercial for someplace like Chili's that makes you want to go in. Then we do, and the service is TERRIBLE from hostess to servers. The restaurant was FILTHY with food on more than 50% of the tables, which was odd bc we got there around noon and they weren't busy at all. We asked about the $10 special and the waitress ROLLED HER EYES and went for the separate menu. We were on lunch hour. Special with burgers took an hour and 20 minutes. Thankful for the checkout screen at the table so we could pay without waiting longer on the terrible service (and STALE food/fries). I'll never be back. I did tip the terrible waitress 18% not bc it was earned but bc I'm probably the only person rewarding that awful service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Aimee G.,"Broken Arrow, OK",0,4,,5.0,11/5/2017,"The food is always great here and we have always had great service. We ordered the fajitas and chipotle chicken tenders with double mashed potatoes, always the best choice for our family. The server was helpful and friendly always stopped by when checking on other tables to make sure we were ok or if we needed anything. We had other servers come by and pick up empty glasses and offer to get more drinks from the bar when our server was busy. The place is always clean and love the fact that we can catch a game or two on one of the many tv's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Scott P.,"Tulsa, OK",93,79,490,2.0,12/29/2016,"We don't frequent national chains often but sometimes they just sound good.  Unfortunately it didn't work out well for us this week.  Tried to go last night but it appears they had a plumbing issue and was closed.  That's fine, things happen but would have been nice if they posted on their store Facebook page.   Tried again tonight, mildly busy at best but there was a logjam of people waiting for a host to show.  Finally get seated and after twenty+ minutes of watching many servers go by and nobody help us, we decided to leave.  If you get a craving for some of their food, is suggest the bar or calling ahead for pick-up.   Oh, and their burgers are just eh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Beth T.,"Broken Arrow, OK",73,14,7,4.0,7/17/2016,"We did carry out, everyone's food was good but mine. So I called and talked to the manager Joel. He was super nice. He remade my burger and then after apologizing he gave me coupons to come back. The carry out service girls are always nice and attentive.  They have the Casadilla Explosion salad which is always fantastic. We usually do carry out because the servers there aren't pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
HungryPilot S.,"Broken Arrow, OK",0,3,,5.0,11/9/2016,"Had to take my car in for service next door.  Was hungry and this place is right there l, so figured why not try them. I admit I was afraid of the reviews but everyone deserves a shot.  This came during a lunch Wednesday. Order some lunch combos. The southwest chicken soup, burger n fries.  Plus a mac n cheese spicy   Wife ordered the salmon and some mashed potatoes.  Guys and gals this place was spot on ! Food was absolute perfection. Server (Serae) was also spot on. Good job!. Even the chef?/manager came out to check on our food!   Will most definitely return. Thought this chain was going to be bad due to rep, but goes to show some people can be wrong. Or management is doing things right!  Keep it up",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Crystal S.,"Tulsa, OK",2,4,,5.0,12/11/2016,"Very happy with service and food!  Chilis is known for a good variety of food and you will not be disappointed with the quality at this branch.  Every server we have had has gone above and beyond to make our visit a great experience.  Today there was a family of 7 (looked to be 3 generations) that were very abusive to their server.  She kept a good attitude and kept smiling even though, in our opinion, they should have been thrown out.  Bravo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
April J.,"Amarillo, TX",0,4,,5.0,6/29/2016,"Excellent, food, service and atmosphere. Saw the negatives and tried anyway. Didn't disappoint. Will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Loren S.,"Bixby, OK",1,3,3,1.0,5/3/2016,"I won't be going back. I was warned and I should have gone somewhere else. 2-3 weeks ago, some family members ate there and said it was horrible. Tough steak hidden under too much butter and sides were lame, they were overcooked and mushy. Last weekend, a friend and her family went (to the same location I later found out) and they said the same thing. Food was overcooked, appetizers came after meal and some orders were cold. Their description was ""It was a no one finished their food and no tip kind of bad..."" Fast forward to tonight and MY personal experience. Ordered my meal online (to use up some reward points) and my son came in and wanted food, so I started to order what he normally gets and he declined it, saying it wasn't worth eating last time (he was with my family members on the first bad experience). He decided on the Chicken Crispers and (literally) said, ""How hard can it be to screw up chicken?""  Well, this Chili's succeeded. Not only that, but the rest of the meal too.  My salmon was hot and burnt on one side. The new quinoa was horrible. The fried asparagus was cold and limp. My son's chicken 'didn't taste right' to him (he offered a bite, but I'm not falling for that one!) and the queso dip was even bad... Oh and the salsa was so salty that it was inedible. So for $40+ dollars, we got some good chips. So, in summary:  If you are looking to spend $40-50 on a meal for two. This is your place. If you are wanting a GOOD meal for that $40-50, go somewhere else. I won't be going back...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Robin A.,"Tulsa, OK",1,16,,1.0,4/30/2016,"We were seated in the bar and placed drink orders within a few minutes. After about 20 minutes the drinks arrived and the server took our order.  She then disappeared. After 30 minutes we asked the bartender who was seldom at the bar to check on our food. We never got any reply. After another 15 minutes we were about to leave when burnt fish was delivered to our table. The restaurant was not crowded at all, and we were given no reason for the delay. I commented on the poor service and food and the food was comped. This used to be a good restaurant but over the last year or two has really deteriorated. We will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Suzanne P.,"Broken Arrow, OK",0,4,1,1.0,4/7/2016,My family and I have eaten at Chilis for several years. Before they made all the new changes it was great food and service.  We have gone back way too many times to give them another chance because it's close to our home. We always leave saying that's the last time! We have had very slow service every time. Took 1.5 hours to serve 3 people. The wait staff dont seem to care. Even when they aren't that busy it takes forever! Only thing that's good is the chips and salsa. The smoked wings were horrible. The skillet brownie was even overcooked. I had to figure out how to pay my bill on kiosk by myself because it was taking so long to get waiter. Done with you Chilis!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Steve B.,"Prosper, TX",32,49,22,2.0,2/20/2015,"I have ordered food to go here a couple of times when I have been in Tulsa/Bixby on business, both times they have gotten the orders wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby

Joey T.,"Tulsa, OK",0,68,1,2.0,6/11/2014,"When they are firing on all cylinders they are decent... but unfortunately this particular location has a spotty record.  The last time I was there I had steak and steamed broccoli.  The steak was spot on for medium well.  The problem was with the broccoli, it was under cooked to the point that it was more like eating warmed up raw broccoli than steamed, but worse still it was so salty that I actually had to use my water to rinse it off before I could eat it.  I was simply told by the waiter that they put a butter sauce on the broccoli... Sorry but there was no butter but way too much salt, which was also true of the chips we had as an appetizer, where normally my daughter would be putting more salt on the chips before eating them here she was actually trying to brush off the salt. Now to be honest the previous time It was fine and we had no problem.  But be warned that their service is random.  We have also been there when the chips were not crispy bur rather soggy.  So go there at your own peril",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Lisa E.,"Broken Arrow, OK",39,143,31,3.0,3/10/2014,"To me, it's a little hard to review popular chain restaurants. Typically, the food is decent ,but not amazing, and it is very generic. That being said, we enjoy going to this Chili's. It is never overly busy, so getting a table is pretty easy. We went Saturday night and got seated right away. We started with chips and salsa and my fiance' ordered a Presidente Margarita, which they brought right out. I waited a little while and then ordered a beer, which the waiter/bartender forgot about and we had to ask another waitress to bring it. My food was pretty good. I got the grilled chicken salad. It wasn't anything to write home about, but it was fresh. My fiance' got the Old Timer burger, which is one of his favorites, so he enjoyed it. We'll go back, but definitely not if we're looking for anything special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Steph H.,"Tulsa, OK",0,4,,2.0,5/19/2015,This Chilis is not great. The wait staff all seem irritated to be there and the food doesn't seem as fresh as other Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Jason F.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,5.0,5/4/2013,"They have the best chips and salsa, and a great kids menu.  Everything else is decent, but who cares since the chips and salsa is so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
Joshua B.,"Glenpool, OK",37,71,30,2.0,11/29/2010,"It's hard to review Chili's. I remember, back before they were the huge chain they are now, having to drive to Salem, Oregon from my hometown, Oakrdige, Oregon, to have to get it. That was about 120 miles. And it was worth it. The Chicken Crispers were crispy and awesome, they had incredible strawberry lemonade that tasted like real fruit and Skillet Queso....man... Skillet Queso....what can you say about that one? That was 15 years ago. And the only thing that is good about Chili's now, 15 years later, is still the Skillet Queso. I'm fairly certain it's the only thing on their menu that has never changed. And I love that. But now, the Chicken Crispers are just greasy and gross, the strawberry lemonade tastes like Kool-Aid with seeds, and the burger I had the other night made me, the instant I bit into it, long to go to Smashburger for a really GREAT burger. Not an overcooked, dry, tasteless lump of meat on a bun. It's a shame that success has meant ruining the food that once was great. I can understand why they would do it, using cheaper  and less tasting-good stuff increases the bottom line. But what kind of restaurant do you want to go to where the bottom line is more important than the taste and quality of their food? Skip Chili's. Go find some local joint to call home when you don't want to cook.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bixby
