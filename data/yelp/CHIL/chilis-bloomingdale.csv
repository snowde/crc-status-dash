Richard F.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,35,,5.0,11/11/2017,"As a veteran on Veteran's Day, I drove all the way up to TGIF restaurant in Bloomingdale based on their invitation for a complimentary veteran's meal. I arrived 5 minutes after 2pm and was informed I'm ineligible as the offer ended exactly at 2pm. The front desk lady said this was based on the manager's orders. What kind of recognition is that? They couldn't be flexible by a few minutes? I went next door to Chili's, where not only were they much more welcoming, but their complimentary meal is offered all day and evening. I was even invited to come back again for a free dinner. The food was excellent with generous portion. I'm avoiding TGIF in the future for this unnecessary stinginess, and will now happily become a regular Chili's customer. The Chili's manager on duty, by the way, was extremely nice and most welcoming of veterans, offering his thanks for our service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale
Camaro K.,"Itasca, IL",0,9,1,2.0,8/14/2017,"Well....I used to LOVE this place as every single meal I had was delish.  Sigh, no longer true.  It was not just mediocre, it was baaaaaaaaaadddddd.  I ordered the smokehouse special with half ribs half chicken.  First few bites of chicken, warm and pretty good...then as the warmth of the chicken quickly wore off...rubber.  Could no longer chew it.   On to the ribs, sauce was good but ribs were barely warm.  There was barely any meat on the ribs..  Not joking...many bites were just sauce on bone.  Leads me to believe they cooked these days before and the second heating just melted away any of the meat and fat were left.  Also, in looking at the rib bones was that freezer burn i saw?....all the white spots on the bones.  I stopped after 2 ribs and then just sopped up the sauce with the fries. The fries were hot and delish.  The beer was good.  One star for each of those.  Was seated quickly and plenty of parking that day. Waitress was friendly enough. I just assume they have a new chef or new kitchen staff.  I sadly will not be back....my food was that bad.  I will stick with Sammys in EGV for ribs...best ever, lots of meat.  Sorry Chilis, breaking up with you...it's not me, it's you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale
Jennifer P.,"Addison, IL",385,946,2328,3.0,5/3/2017,"My friend told me that, when it comes to chicken strips, that Chili's Chicken Crispers are THE. BEST. I placed a Take-Out order to satisfy the craving. I used online ordering, which was super convenient. I didn't have to enter CC information like some other restaurants require. My order was already waiting by the promised time. Service was friendly. Food: - Fries: Pretty good: nicely seasoned, warm, but on the limp side. (That's never good for anyone..) -  Black beans: The pico was a nice touch. Oftentimes black beans are overly salty, but these weren't. - Chicken: Crispy, plentiful. However, two pieces had a bizarre plastic taste (the others were fine). - Honey mustard: Good... But there wasn't nearly enough! I ate the first two pieces plain/in the car sans sauce. So the amount of sauce they gave me didn't even cover 3 pieces of chicken! Skimpy sauce is disappointing. Overall it was just A-OK, but I think the inconsistencies in chicken, plus an anemic amount of sauce are enough to discourage a return trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale

Jack S.,"Bloomingdale, IL",2,28,9,3.0,7/22/2017,"It's a chilli's. Probably shouldn't come here if you're expecting the utmost fine dining cuisine experience. However, Chilli's is very affordable and a good bang for your buck. We usually get the 2 for $20 deal which comes with 2 entrees and an appetizer. It's always very filling and pretty cheap. This is not the best restaurant to find healthy options. However I would suggest substituting French fries for the quinoa salad if you're a little more health conscious. Service is great and so is the price, the taste is exactly what you should expect from a place like this, about average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale

Nicki S.,"Lombard, IL",67,179,111,4.0,7/25/2016,"I haven't been to a Chili's in a very long time and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The menu changed but it seems to have something for everyone! Pasta, salad, flat breads, burgers, steaks, fajitas, etc. The portions were huge I had to ask for a box right away because I knew there was no way I could finish. Server was attentive. No wait for a table but the wait for food was a little long -- we came on a Sunday late afternoon. I like that you could pay at the table via tablet -- I didn't like that we had to complete a survey instead of just leaving after we paid. Overall happy with the changes I experienced with chills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale
Chris E.,"Glendale Heights, IL",60,80,,1.0,11/29/2017,"Usually have good service but today was as bad as I have seen in a long time.  Very slow, waiter did not know how to discount the 2 for $22 promo and took 10 minutes to bring out the chips and salsa on a very slow night.  The drinks had to be requested multiple times for refills.  My ribs were luke warm at best he offered to have them regrilled but I was starving by this time.  The 2 for 22 meal was fine.  Portion size was fine.  Waiter was then shoving all of the table scraps into the middle of the floor and left it there before coming back to sweep it up and them left that broom on the chair behind me.  Normally we are in and out within an hour to and hour and fifteen minutes but today it was almost 2 hours.  Another waitress had to correct our bill and help us with applying the discount code from our phone for the dessert.  Did not see the manager for at least the first hour or hour and fifteen minutes but he never asked any tables how things were and when we left he was in the bar area watching the hockey game.  Last time when i had an issue with being charged $1 more for the grilled corn when I did not want that but it came with my meal it was rectified and he stopped by the table 2-3 times...this time no communication.  At least the bathrooms were clean and stocked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale

Stephanie T.,"Bloomingdale, IL",17,3,,1.0,10/28/2016,"I called in an order at 625pm TO-GO. The order was just a bowl of chili and an order of onion rings. The lady said it would be 15mins. I got there a little early so i sat in the car for 5mins. I was on my lunch from my retail job. I paid for my order and waited and waited. Now it was 710pm when i told the lady i only ordered a bowl of Chili and onion rings. My order was sitting there the WHOLE time! I told her i wanted my money back. She had to get the mgr at which no customer service no above and beyond service, he didnt even try to make things right! I was checking out the chili for our office party for Black Friday... I guess that is NOT happening!  Update**** The GM has contacted me and heard my complaint and has rectified this experience. Thank you",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale
Alex M.,"Hanover Park, IL",110,18,6,1.0,11/18/2016,"I placed an order around 10AM for 11:50AM pickup. This was a lunch for a coworkers last day. Ordered two chipotles chicken salads with soups and two buffalo chicken sandwiches. Both sandwiches were completely wrong.  We ordered one to have blue cheese and the other ranch, cheddar cheese on both, both no tomatoes, one no lettuce.  Even though this order was placed online they managed to get it wrong.  Both sandwiches got blue cheese one should have had ranch, no cheese on one the other got American instead of cheddar. No lettuce on both (one should have had).  Attention to detail is not taken seriously at this location. Ample time was given to prep the order. It was placed via   using options that chilis deemed understandable by its employees. So I expect it to be made correctly. I am a very easy going person when it comes to food but when the order is placed online I don't understand how someone can get it wrong still. There is no possible way that there was a misunderstanding like there would be if I was placing a phone order that I could understand maybe I said something wrong but this was clear as day. This is one of the reasons big chain restaurants like chilis are losing business.  Will not be ordering from chilis again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale
Jei A.,"Carol Stream, IL",1,31,7,1.0,5/31/2016,"I frequent this place and other's quite often but was a little surprised this Saturday at our meal. We didn't feel like eating in so we ordered it to go, so that we could enjoy the family that came in for my sons graduation. We got the food home and I was quite disappointed with our meal. Usually it's pretty  tasty but this time it seemed a little rushed or something. Maybe because they were so busy or because it was late (dinner rush) whatever the case I was extremely disappointed and didn't even finish my meal.  My potatoes had some sort of film over them that at first I just scraped off. That was probably disgusting enough to do. But then when I put the fork into it again they were like on the fork but a string still to the plate.. uummm yeah I don't think potatoes should do that. So, I decided to just throw them away. Even the meat looked funny. Not just my food was horrible. Everyone's was. We won't be dining here anymore.. too bad it was my favorite :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale

I walked to him and asked him for someone to wipe the chairs.  Another guy cam and wiped the chair with a wet towel.  I told him they need yo be dried!! This is common sense ! I looked down and there was food all over the floor.. everywhere.  I walked in the direction of the door and saw the first guy, i started talking to him that we will not stay because of --- and he simply ignored me and started waving at his friends who were walking in.  I asked for the manager and explained my perspective and her excuse was 'others just left the table thats why it's dirty' really?!!

Then they charged us for it and tried to say they're a franchise and don't participate in rewards. I asked our server why when I showed the email before ordering it, why didn't they say something? He took it off. Another waitress just kept saying they are Brinker (their corporate name). I asked if that's the name on the building, no it's Chili's. I get it, I do, I used to work for a franchise of GNC and understand they don't always follow the same rules, but it's bs for customers, especially if the reward is what made you decide to go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale

Thomas T.,"Irvine, CA",108,279,1,3.0,2/10/2014,"Grew up going here and it's always a pleasant experience. Some good, some bad but for the most part, good. Came recently which is what I'll base this review off of. First I noticed that the booths, floors, and atmosphere are getting outdated and old. Maybe it's time for an remodel? I only say that because the booth I was sitting at moved every time the person behind me moved, and that was some teenage girl who wouldn't sit still. Pretty annoying. I just sucked it up and didn't complain about it. Another small thing that bugged me was that iced tea was the same price as a soft drink. But that's not really their fault, just Chili's in general I suppose. Did the 2 for 20 with my mom which I think is a great deal, so props there. I got the Margarita grilled chicken and my mom got the Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadillas and we got the chipotle chicken flatbread app. I'm trying out a diet, don't judge me. I used to always get the baby back ribs which are delicious and I miss so much.... But anyway the chicken was pretty good. Good flavors with the tomatoes mixed in and then also adding the crunch with the tortilla strips. Didn't care for the beans, it looked like soup. Quesidillas were good but that is what it is pretty much, nothing special. My dad got the chicken fajitas which were pretty good, but again that's pretty straight up, just give someone all the ingredients and let them make their own fajita. Overall fine night besides the certain booth I was at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale?start=20

Robert G.,"Carol Stream, IL",174,503,173,4.0,7/9/2013,"Not bad, especially for a chain. They've been busy lately, possibly because the Applebees down the street closed, either for remodeling or for good. Here I had the mango-chile tilapia, while the wife and I shared jumbo soft pretzels. The pretzels weren't bad, but I was impressed by the tilapia, which was flavorful (and being on the ""light"" menu, I would hope so), flaky and a just a little bit spicy. What's really nice is being able to pay right at the table, saving the trouble of having to sign paper receipts and being able to e-mail myself the receipt.

I've even picked up to go from this place! They have your standard appetizers, flat breads (new), soups, salads, and pizzas now! Of course they also have burgers, ribs (I want my baby back), chicken, and seafood. I love how they have lighter options, combos, Mexican fare (tacos, fajitas, quesadilla). They also have a ton of dessert options. Again, this place has OPTIONS! You as the consumer ARE IN CONTROL! If someone is picky (see children), this is the spot to hit because they have everything!

Chili's has definitely made some improvements since the nineties, but I still wouldn't call it a fave.  Some things that are pretty decent include the skillet queso, the fire grilled corn guacamole and salsa (and all you can eat chips!), the fajitas (the trio isn't bad but steak is my favorite), and the margaritas.  Seriously, I ONLY come here for these things.     Everything else is just alright.  Alright service, alright atmosphere, alright food, alright bar menu (NOT including beer.  None of their beer is good.  Beer snobs beware!).  Overall, I like coming here for a change in the restaurant rotation, but I'm not planning on becoming a regular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomingdale?start=20
