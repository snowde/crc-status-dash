I G.,"Fair Oaks Ranch, TX",1,19,8,3.0,12/22/2017,Not bad. It's chili's. It's freezing in here  ( .Y. ). Fajitas were good today yummy! Chips!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Eric Q.,"Boerne, TX",0,3,,2.0,1/13/2018,Great food.  It's a shame i have to eat it at a stop light.  Wait staff was nice.  just really rude to squeeze these large families on both sides of me when there was open tables all over the restuarant.  Very rude.  I just wanted to move seats or get my $ back but instead they just took my cash and turned me away.  No apology no options nothing. Chilis must think we look like cattle because thats exactly how we were all treated. Thanks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Ashley S.,"San Antonio, TX",77,83,130,4.0,12/16/2017,"Our To Go orders are almost never right--to a MADdening degree--but when we eat here, I'm almost always blown away impressed by the servers. We've had a couple of guys wait on us in the bar area that have been just amazing, so friendly and attentive and on top of things. I wish I could remember names right now because they deserve to be recognized. I'll update my review next time we dine in. If this review was only based on our to-go orders, which is what we do most often, it would be lower, but the food (when it's right) and the servers bumped it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Kathy H.,"San Antonio, TX",227,100,633,5.0,5/5/2017,"It's Cinco de Mayo and an a margarita is required.   Chili's was the compromise for food (someone really wanted an Ultimate Bacon Burger ).  Food was excellent! Chips and salsa, the burger and Margarita Grill Chicken accompanied the Margarita on tap (for a limited time). Sat at the bar. The restaurant was super busy!  The bartender, Nathan, was a professional juggler between taking care of his bar patrons with 5-star plus service  and getting drinks for the rest of the restaurant! He was cool and nice!  It was also cool to see the manager step in and help him here and there! What a great team atmosphere! Next time you're in...go sit in the bar area, meet Nathan and have him pour you a drink!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Tim K.,"San Antonio, TX",4,105,39,2.0,11/25/2017,Typical Chilis fare but lots of issues with the service. Busy for a Saturday night but took us about 10 minutes to get anyone to even come to our table after being seated. Once ordered they brought us multiple wrong items or incorrectly prepared items. Asked for no sour cream with one item and was actually given and charged for extra sour cream. Had duplicate charges with our final bill and had to wait for a manager to fix it so definitely defeated the benefit of the kiosk to pay when you are ready. The food overall was solid as it usually is but amazingly they had no tortilla chips by 8 on a Saturday so unable to get the bottomless chips we love.  Mistakes were all ultimately corrected but it made for a very long dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Jerry M.,"Boerne, TX",252,145,77,5.0,9/28/2017,Why so many poor reviews is beyond me. Took the wife out for a late dinner and we decided on Chilis. What a great experience it was. The place was packed at 9pm   We had a 5 min wait. We had a great waiter never an empty glass  I ordered the ribeye and wife ordered chicken crispers and chip and salsa. Chips came right out hot and fresh. We had just about finished the chips and out came the food. My ribeye was cooked perfectly and just melted in my mouth. I can still taste it in my mind it was that good.  The wife's crispers where (in her words) awesome. The service was excellent the food was excellent. We will be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Bill Y.,"Seneca, SC",0,370,135,4.0,6/25/2017,We were on a tour of the hill country out of San Antonio. This place was near the interstate and had a lot of cars around it.  The service was fast and the food was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Marissa G.,"San Antonio, TX",7,9,6,1.0,5/15/2017,If I could give NO stars I would. The WORST chilis I have ever been to. I ordered their chicken avocado flatbread and got the worst lunch I have ever received in my life. Horrible customer service as well! AVOID THIS PLACE,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
B.r. A.,"San Antonio, TX",32,6,2,2.0,4/25/2017,Food food but service horrible! Manager and entire wait staff and kitchen could be heard in dining room joking around while our tea glasses went empty and evaporated!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
J B.,"Boerne, TX",0,3,,3.0,11/4/2017,The biggest problem is to go orders are usually wrong or missing something. I know better and should have checked my order but again missing a meal when I got home today. Ugh,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Brooks B.,"Georgetown, TX",0,38,,2.0,7/22/2017,"Been here several time, but never have had a good experience. We kept trying, but its not good. Food is horrible and service is hit or miss. Order to go food and they messed up our order, but not a big deal, but when I called about it the young lady hung up on me then when I called back she was very rude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Food Critics.Co M.,"Boerne, TX",0,15,1,1.0,12/11/2016,Surprise surprise.. I'm sitting at the bar with a direct view of the kitchen and staff.. Cooks are not wearing gloves.. all food is handled with bare hands.. even the waiters and waitresses pour the soup orders and dig their bare hands in the soup toppings.. I'm am so grossed out right now I want to puke.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
S S.,"Boerne, TX",14,204,72,1.0,10/2/2016,Our food was just plain gross!!! This place is one of the worst choice of all the restaurants in boerne!!!  Just plain awful,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Steve W.,"Kerrville, TX",509,15,2,1.0,9/6/2016,"Never thought I'd find a Chilis worse than the one in Kerrville.  From the hostess to the Manager, and everyone in between, inept is an overstatement! Runny salsa comes with a lame excuse, second visit running. Needless to say, I will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Kerry H.,"San Antonio, TX",20,4,,4.0,11/12/2016,"Despite mixed reviews, we visited this Chili's on Veterans Day, one of their busiest days of the year, and during the lunch hour to boot. Yet, we were seated immediately (even though a party of five). Our server was exceptionally polite and helpful and the food was wonderful. Of course our two free Veterans meals were deeply appreciated. Way to go, Chili's! We'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
mike f.,"Castle Rock, CO",2,15,,4.0,11/30/2016,"Good drink specials, nice atmosphere in the bar. Free chips at the bar during Happyhours",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Laura L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,1.0,7/5/2016,"Absolutely unbelievably terrible. Service was atrocious. Ordering to go includes a 30 minute wait, food was soggy and slightly cold. Thank you to the rude women who attended to me as a customer with little care to put silverware in my bag so I can eat a salad with my hands and drink my soup out of the cup it came in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Nick S.,"Houston, TX",60,244,943,5.0,6/9/2013,"Great service. Right OFF I-10. Consistency with good bar food, including soup and salads. It was packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
B.J. S.,"Boerne, TX",12,17,17,4.0,12/16/2015,Service was good and food was good.  I am only giving four stars as it is a chain so I can't really give it five.  I've been to a lot of Chili's and this one is up there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Chris S.,"Boerne, TX",0,5,,1.0,6/5/2015,"Wrote a review here yesterday which has mysteriously disappeared. I'll try it again. We have come to this location numerous times; for being a tourist town, Boerne is woefully equipped with reasonably-price restaurants that actually have good food. This Chili's has been slipping for quite a while. Very hit or miss, so when we stopp ed Wed. 6/3, we ordered some drinks & chips/salsa. Salsa runnier than ever, no chunkiness at all. And the chips! A layer of tortilla crumbles that looked more like breakfast cereal, a thin layer of  translucently oily whole chips on top. I picked through these to find a few good ones, drank my tea (which was never refilled, or refill offered) and we decided not to eat here. Or go back again. This is a cumulative score over a half dozen visits, not just about this instance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne
Snort W.,"Houston, TX",24,22,7,4.0,3/26/2015,I took a large group of 12 8th graders and they set us up quickly. The servers were great and responsive. We all ordered a variety of food and everything was delivered correctly. Chips and salsa were good though I prefer more hotness in the salsa. This group cleaned their plates which is always a good sign.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
Karen M.,"TX, TX",0,78,121,2.0,11/8/2014,Don't stop. The place is packed and poorly staffed.  Chili's to go is closed with a sign that says see bartender.  Bar tables are full and there is one bartender.  The dinning room is completely full and there is no wait staff anywhere to be seen.  People at the door and there is no hostess.  It is noon on Saturday of a holiday weekend. I feel sorry for the lone bartender.  Walked to Whataburger for a salad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
Vicki S.,"Boerne, TX",0,3,,1.0,5/9/2015,"This is the worst Chili's in America!  Rude staff, dirty and bartender didn't know the basics!  Not a lot of choices in Boerne, but you are better off at the Wendy's!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
Cristy C.,"Boerne, TX",65,1,,1.0,2/22/2015,I have been to this chilis probably 5 times now.   Chilis is my favorite place to eat and I have never once been to this chilis and not had a problem.  Every time something is wrong with the orders.  The food was cold. The drinks were wrong the food didn't taste good.  This chilis is the worst chilis I've ever been to.   I just moved here and am very disappointed that my local chilis has horrible food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
Goldstar P.,"San Antonio, TX",9,4,,1.0,10/6/2015,"I never had an issue with Chilis or their food until I returned home recently in Boerne, TX. It was 2:30 pm (mid-September) and I understand waitstaff tends to get relieved after the rush but when you're standing alone in the door with a handicapped, elderly lady I think someone would say something or make some effort. Especially when wait staff kept looking over at us. 15+ minute wait until I decided to seat myself and mom. Sat down and ordered and food never came in 40 minutes so we left. After and hour of waiting we just got up and left. Staff walking around dining room, people joking in wait staff area, cooks looking right at me, and the bar was pretty full. 3-5 other parties dining. Everyone served but us. Even those who arrived after us. Obviously not going back. Found out this happened to my brother and his family earlier in the year and to my sister the previous year. Just plain bad service unless you are getting drunk in the afternoon. Rather spend/invest my money at places who really want your patronage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
Marisa G.,"Boerne, TX",0,7,2,1.0,4/11/2015,"This was the worst Chili's my family and I have ever been to. The food and service were horrible. We always order the skillet queso. The salsa was very watery and queso was just weird. It was greasy and had a strange texture to it. My steak was bland and mashed potatoes were extremely dry. My daughter did not like the chicken in her pasta and picked it out. The server let our drinks go empty and was pretty much non-existant. I haven't given up on Chili's yet, but we will not be visiting this one again. So disappointed since it's just down the street from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
Deb T.,"League City, TX",0,9,1,1.0,10/18/2013,"Maybe one star is one too many! We arrived around 8pm, the place was not crowded however people were waiting to be seated so we sat in the bar. We ordered drinks and waited and waited and waited until we finally got our drinks. We ordered ""jumbo""pretzel sticks and an order of nachos. Our food took forever to arrive and the best thing I can say is the nachos were still warm, in fact the 7 nachos were burned and the meat tasted funny. The pretzels were not what I would call jumbo and the cheese sauce was probably not real cheese.  Service was too slow and chilies should be embarassed to serve food like that. I wish I had taken a picture. I don't think all chilies serve food like that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
Bill B.,"Dallas, TX",102,580,1772,4.0,4/23/2013,"We stooped at this Chili's location for the $20 meal for two. Started with the dip and chips which were excellent. Ordered the steak and chicken as the two entrees and both were prepared quite well. The broccolis was fresh and crisp. We had an excellent waitress that would talk you leg off. She was very efficient in her service and out tea glasses never ran dry. Good food, at a great price and great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
Tiger K.,"San Antonio, TX",0,63,39,1.0,3/8/2014,"No need to review the food, it's Chilis. They all taste about the same.  However the service here sucks! Living not far from this location, I've been here many times. After dining here several times last year, I mentioned to my waiter (and finally the manager) that the tea had a funky taste not found in the water. It was obviously the tea making machine. On subsequent visits this was not fixed so I started ordering water. On one visit last year I waited 1 hour for an order of spicy shrimp tacos. To top it off they charged me instead of comping it. On today's visit I waited and waited for a water refill and more chips and salsa before another waitress noticed and asked if I wanted more. Then I noticed a couple at the table next to me looking at their margarita.  They flagged down their waitress who took it away. I asked them what was wrong and they explained there was a FLY in their margarita. REALLY!!!  Guess what and you're not gonna believe this. They were charged double for the margarita. Not sure if that was corrected or not because I left before they payed. I hope corporate reads reviews because a manager and training changes need to be made immediately.  Make this happen by eating elsewhere!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
JoAnn O.,"Red Rock, TX",0,153,5,4.0,10/31/2010,I always like Chili's no matter what city I am in.  We were going home from Garner Sate Park to San Antonio and stop Chili in Borne to have dinner.  We were greeting and seating after a short wait.  Our waitress Katroma is very friendly and attentively but not very imposing.  I had their Quesadilla Explosion Salad and husband had the burger plus crispy onion string and jalapeno stack appetizer.  We don't care for the crispy onion string.  They are way too thin and greasy and salty for me.  We enjoy the dinning experience and the value are great.  Thumbs up for Chili's again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
Tony K.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",4,288,224,4.0,10/23/2008,"The food was good and the service was even better.  Daniel was our server.  They did forget my garlic bread with my pasta....  Server asked cook and he said it was on the plate?????  Who ate my bread????  Manager fixed it and made me new garlic bread.  The place was pretty crowded for 945pm when we got there.  No the best, not the worst.  Hey its Chili's I did not expect much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boerne?start=20
