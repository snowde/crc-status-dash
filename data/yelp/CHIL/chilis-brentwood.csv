Lakeshia P.,"Antioch, Nashville, TN",0,4,,4.0,10/6/2017,"This place was awesome the triple plate, Southwest eggs rolls is very good and the waiter was excellent",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Samuel E.,"Pleasant View, TN",16,120,1,1.0,10/19/2017,"I've been here a couple of times in past 6 weeks and off and on for years (due to request of clients and friends who aren't familiar with the area and it's close to the office). Always same problem, service is slow and awful, but at least friendly to the patrons but being very loud, trashy and mean to their fellow employees while on the floor...they, should really take that behavior to the back of the kitchen...also, good luck on not having to flag down multiple people to get a drink refill Food always comes out cold. Most recently my burger that I asked for extra rare was so unbelievably overcooked, I could only take two bites because it felt like chewing jerky....also, the amount of mustard they put on it accompsnied with the cheese being literally halfway off the burger made it clear they were screwing it up on purpose. Onion rings were mushy tasted like they had been fried, left out cold, fried again, left out cold again, then finally microwaved. Lastly, I like my food salty and could only have a small bite due to the ridiculous amount of salt that was on them.....awful service and food quality is par for course here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Neema C.,"Nashville, TN",4,65,230,5.0,5/6/2017,"Highly recommend: bone in wings, loaded mashed potatoes, fajitas, nachos,  Not recommend: flavored ribs (no meat on it lol), steak (bland).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Carlin M.,"Nashville, TN",0,5,,2.0,9/12/2017,We went for late lunch on a Monday and we were one of three tables in the restaurant. Our server Lindsey was too busy chatting with her fellow servers beside the cash register to come and see if our table needed anything. I actually had to get up from the table twice in order to ask for more water and more salad dressing. By the time we were ready to leave we could not get Lindsay's attention so we were fortunate enough to get the attention of another server in order to be given our checks. After putting our money out we waited and waited and waited for Lindsay to come and pick up the checks and she never did. So we adjusted our payment so we could pay in cash and left. It took us over an hour and a half to eat a sandwich and a salad. Very disappointing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Shaw V.,"Brentwood, TN",0,2,,1.0,12/9/2017,"I would rather try to find road kill or eat out of a trash can than go through that again!!! Worst customer service I've ever experienced!!!! No hostess on duty, loud obnoxious ride bartender that has no respect for people with children and ride to customers, waitresses that do not return to check on their customers!!!! I almost started to head to the kitchen to help mysef!!!! Fajitas came out and were not sizzling and veggies were barely cooked!!!! Do yourself a favor, stay away !!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Oscar H.,"Brentwood, TN",0,66,,3.0,10/19/2016,"My wife and I stopped by this Chili's yesterday for a late lunch. We haven't been to Chili's in years so we gave it a try I got the 10"" classic sirloin, the citrus-chile rice and the steamed broccoli. The steakwas cooked as I ordered is and the vegetables were OK. According to their Nutrition Chart, that only cost 560 calories. I'd rather have that than anything on their lo-cal ""Lighter Choices"" section. Looks like that Chili's will be our new family restaurant..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Daniel M.,"Bangor, ME",10,72,44,5.0,2/7/2017,Happy hour. Service was fast. The loaded boneless wings were just the type of comfort food needed for happy hour.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Jeff O.,"Franklin, TN",82,91,30,2.0,2/24/2017,"We went there, tonight, and were quickly reminded why we do not generally go to this location.  While the food was good, the service was not even mediocre.  I believe we sat for at least 10 minutes once we were seated before we finally flagged the host down to let him know our server had not come by for drinks.  That was pretty much how things went.  All three of us were empty for a while before we were able to find our server again and request refills on our drinks.  I am not sure if there is poor management in the front of the house, if our server was spread too thin, or ????  There are too many options for patrons to consider to provide such lackluster service. On the bright side, I did really enjoy the quesadilla explosion salad - the quesadilla, which I usually do not ever get one, had an extra sort of crispy / fried taste feel to it that let me know I was going to like this, but it was likely not even close to healthy, despite being served alongside a salad.  My wife really likes the shrimp tacos, too, which is one of her go-to dishes at Chili's.  I enjoyed the mango flavored tea, too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Ginny M.,"Brentwood, TN",12,33,93,2.0,7/31/2017,"I go here often for a late lunch (maybe 1pm?) on my lunch ""hour."" They take way too long and are never staffed properly. Last time I came by myself I had to literally call the restaurant phone to get someone to come to the host stand after ten minutes. Just now I had a water in the bar area and waited 15 minutes for the bartender to take my order - so I left and wasted 30 minutes of my lunch hour. He should have more help for sure but he was making frozen drinks for people as soon as they ordered them and still never came to help me. I always go against my better judgement bc their food is good, but their service is just too poor. I won't be back -- and I work across the street so it's a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Malynna K.,"Nashville, TN",98,89,223,4.0,12/7/2016,"Oh man, I hate to say this but chilis is my guilty pleasure. I come here for one thing, and one thing only. I rarely stray away from my typical order, which is the triple dipper. I ALWAYS get at least the southwestern egg rolls and boneless wings, and my third choice is sometimes random...usually between the spinach and artichoke dip or sliders. Another favorite of mine is the skillet queso and chips. Idk what it is about the southwestern egg rolls and skillet queso that keeps me coming back, but it's so good. Bottomless chips and salsa in the bar area is always a plus, too! I've never had too much of an issue with service, probably bc I come during slow hours (3pm-ish) and I sit in the bar area. Plus they have the handy pay at the table tablet where we can pay whenever we want. And you can't beat 2-4-1's!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Jennifer P.,"Nashville, TN",26,175,19,2.0,8/24/2016,"The service here has gone steadily downhill -- but it's not the servers... it's the manager who schedules them.   The poor servers are understaffed and overworked and they take the brunt of unhappy customers.  Based on the slow/cold food I think the kitchen is understaffed too.  If you are aiming for profit by short-changing your staff, you may find your customers desert you too.  Let me reiterate the SERVERS are excellent and try to do a good job. But the staffing model is off kilter. Please fix it and go back to being a fun place to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Debbie C.,"Brentwood, TN",15,8,,2.0,9/3/2017,Poor quality meat for the burgers.  It took four napkins to absorb the grease!   Two bites and I was done.  The fries were good!   Server was excellent.   I do not ask for a return of food to the kitchen.   Not a happy customer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Ronald B.,"Memphis, TN",71,3,,3.0,10/15/2016,"Buyer Beware. I would have given a 4 star because the food was hot and tasted pretty good, however, I was irritated by getting a 1.99 charge for table entertainment kiosk without being warned.

Chelsea C.,"Brentwood, TN",4,3,,2.0,6/23/2017,"My boyfriend and I came in on a Friday night around 6:30. It wasn't that busy. We waited 8 minutes for a server (named Bree), which as a server I can say is not THAT bad but it is pretty noticeable. We order drinks and were asked immediately what we wanted for dinner instantly after she dropped of the drinks, not asking if we wanted appetizers. I ordered a margarita and an appetizer at the same time and I didn't get the drink until after we ordered dinner. Our dinner was dropped off by what looked like a manager. He filled up our drinks and we never saw our server or the manager for that matter for 10-15 more minutes. No one came and checked how our meal was or if we needed anything. Our server came back up and got us a Togo box and then seem bothered when we asked for dessert almost half walking away as we were. It took 17 minutes for dessert. Again, it's not busy. The food was mediocre. The cheese bites tasted like something from sonic and was cold. The queso tasted like slightly warmed spaghetti-o's. You know the kind. The only good think about this meal was the chocolate molten cake!! Since both of us are servers we understand having a bad night. Or not being interested in working at all. But there's no way you can mess up this much at one singular table without trying. We would know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Moreen L.,"Franklin, TN",1,5,1,3.0,7/11/2016,Got a to go order - not even close to looking like the menu item - prime rib fresh next bowl - terrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Andy B.,"Brentwood, TN",0,12,,2.0,2/4/2017,"The low score is simply because of how slow the service is. The servers try hard and I would guess are not the ones to blame. We will not be back simply for the reason we do not have two hours. It hasn't been once, but now a total of three times.  Each time once we are seated, it has taken over a hour each time. Maybe carry out but no longer the inside visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Cat T.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,6,6,3.0,5/15/2016,Good food but SLOW service.  We ate here around 4 pm on Saturday. We were seated right away as they were not too busy. Waited about 15 minutes just for our drinks and chips & salsa. Other than the wait it was great... Great food & the pineapple-blueberry mixed drink is delish!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Erin C.,"Clarksville, TN",113,46,,3.0,5/1/2017,"Our service was good which is probably the only positive thing about our experience here. My soup was almost cold and my fajitas were flavorless. Chilis, step it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Dustin S.,"Brentwood, TN",31,1,,5.0,10/20/2016,Jill and Leanna are great! Also Terri is the best manager I have ever encountered in a family style restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to any one staying in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood
Vickie W.,"Brentwood, TN",40,14,1,2.0,8/14/2016,I like Chilis but I got very sick after having A margarita to the point I had to go to the hospital for fluids. I just talked to a friend that got sick after drinking them there as well so make them clean that rim thing they wet s your rim for the salt I think that what's food poisoning people. Lot of bars never change those Thing I think that may be were the food poisoning came from but just educated guess,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood?start=20
Jared P.,"Brentwood, TN",16,31,206,2.0,11/6/2014,"I know it's a chain, a chilis, but wow. Prices are good, drinks are great, but the food was bad. I ordered the quesadilla and vomit instead. The salad was brown, and good luck getting a refill. It took 15 minutes just to get a water. Chilis is a great place for drinks after work, and the chips and salsa are out of this world. But the food was extremely disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood?start=20
Amber M.,"Nashville, TN",69,3,,2.0,9/11/2016,"I'm irritated by the service my husband and I received at this Chili's, and will not be a repeat customer.  The food was good, but the service was way below average.  We were seated promptly upon arrival; the restaurant was not at all busy.  We sat there for about 15 minutes before anyone came to get our drink order (we placed our entire order since we had already been sitting there a while).  Our appetizer was sizzling hot when served to us, but the person who served it to us didn't say a word to us.  The woman who served us our meals didn't smile, but did ask if we needed anything else.  We thanked her and started in on our entrees.  Shortly after, I ran out of water. I looked around for a server, but didn't see one.  Thankfully I was close enough to the little bar they keep the water pitchers at, so I was able to help myself.   After I had finished half of that glass of water, our waitress checked on us for the first time since taking our order.  At that time she refilled my husband's glass.  We did not see her again the rest of the time we were there.  I refilled my own glass again and had to hunt someone down to get a box for the food.  If it weren't for the little kiosk at the table, we probably never would have received the check.  I don't recommend going to this particular Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood?start=20
Chloe H.,"Spearfish, SD",200,5,11,1.0,6/8/2015,"Yesterday I had chips and guacamole and the classic bacon burger and within two hours was vomiting. I've been to this chilis several times and I don't know exactly what made me sick, but I don't think I'll be back to this chilis or any chilis for a good long while. The service is ok and the place is clean most days, but yesterday we had to flag down another waiter because ours hadn't checked on us or refilled our drinks for a long time and we never got silverware and ended up splitting a roll we found on the ledge above us. I'm just put off. Sorry chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood?start=20
Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",668,491,62,4.0,8/28/2011,"This Chilli's was right next to our hotel when we were looking for apartments in Tennessee so we decided to grab a drink and an appetizer right when we got there since it was literally a three minute walk away and we were tired of being stuck in the car.  The staff there was so friendly and we enjoyed the food and drinks immensely. Although the food is the same thing you could find out here, the quality seemed better. It tasted like some body actually cooked it!!! Ha ha.

I ordered the chips & salsa first before ordering so I could get something in my stomach. The salad comes, the meal comes and no chips! My father said his chili was horrible and sent it back. He never does this so it had to be awful. I waited 15 minutes before I ever got any food....They did still bring the chips but they were useless.  The booth we sat in was cut open and not clean.

MARCUS B.,"Nashville, TN",3,4,,1.0,6/11/2014,Ate here the other day and the Chipotle Flatbread was so salty I couldn't eat it.  I had to take it home.  Tried to feed it to my dog and he wouldn't even eat it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood?start=20
Allison B.,"Brentwood, TN",0,7,,5.0,12/11/2014,"LOVE this Chilis. There are a few waiters that need a little *ahem* training, but there is this one really sweet petite foreign waitress that has been there forever! It's a shame that I don't know her name, because she's so spunky, efficient, & professional! Fast service, 2 for 1 drinks all day, every day.

I had the avocado burger which was absolutely delicious. Trying to eat healthier these days and if you take the time to actually read through the menu, finding something to eat is not hard.

Mark T.,"Dover, NH",0,4,,2.0,3/17/2013,"Took a while to get seated or acknowledged. It's a slow night and more employees than customers. Staff came out of kitchen, looked at me, than sat down at a table. Bartender came out from behind the bar to seat me. Terrible.  Food was okay. Server found the allergen menu quickly. After food delivery, staff became hard to find. One checkin shortly after food delivery but never got a check for refill on my soda water. I had to flag someone down to get a check after sitting done with my food for sometime.

Stephanie H.,"Nashville, TN",0,5,,1.0,2/18/2013,"Today the girls and I from the office went for lunch(about 5 of us). We understand it's a busy time for the business lunch crowd, but when we put our order in we waited over 40 minutes to receive our food. The majority of the order was only salads, sandwiches, and an appetizer (which is easy to make). The manager already gave us our lunch for free for being so late, but on top of that, the food was cold and did not include any of our items that said on the menu. Also, before we even asked about our order, the waiter was ingoring us the whole time we were there. Not only did we wait forever, but I am also an hourly employee which when I was out for 1.5 hours!

Michelle P.,"Nashville, TN",228,129,84,3.0,2/21/2013,"I usually have a good experience here. Most of those times I have been at the bar and ordering basic appetizers. I think they have that part down. This trip my fiancé and I got a table in the bar but decided on entrees. We ordered the two for 20 meal deal. Cheese sticks as apps that were decent but came with a tiny container of marinara. People, In with a grown man...one dip for him and its all gone. We ordered Parmesan crusted sirloins with broccoli and potatoes. The steak was cooked at the temp I requested although it was still a tiny brick. My potatoes were just blah. Could have never been hot since cheese didn't melt on them. The broccoli. Oh lord the broccoli. It was raw. I cook it at home so I know. So they sent it back and I actually saw him pop it in a microwave and it was still raw. They offered me ""French fries"" like I didn't already have terrible spuds on my plate. It wasn't our servers fault. He was nice. The kitchen on the other hand has to learn the art of steaming broccoli. The manager came out and apologized. Apology accepted. BUT I'll stick to my apps and drink specials. Point taken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood?start=20

Heather S.,"Brentwood, TN",0,8,,2.0,8/31/2014,"We ate here for lunch a few weeks ago.  I hadn't been to a Chili's in several years and my children really wanted Pei Wei.  I told them we had to try something new and wish I had not done so.  We had to wait for a table because they were all dirty not full of people.  We were seated at a table that still had dirty napkins and spilled food underneath.  It took a while to be noticed, but finally our table was taken by another server. The food tasted good but the presentation of my salad was on par with a fast food restaurant if not worse.  On a trio to the restroom we were almost run over by a dancing server and again on the return by a server slinging his dust rag in the air.  Our server disappeared after we got our food??  The kitchen floor was disgusting, service was avg and upon leaving we had to navigate around several tables that were pulled out from wall with dirty dustpans beside them (no server actively cleaning them).  Too expensive for this type of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood?start=20
