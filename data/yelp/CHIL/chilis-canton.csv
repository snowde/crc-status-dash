Catrina D.,"Uniontown, OH",33,124,12,4.0,7/10/2017,"I used to eat at Chili's ALL THE TIME, but now I only go once every so often, I am sad at a lot of the changes they made to the dishes that have been standard for years, I know they are probably trying to keep up with the new/modern restaraunts in the area, but sometimes leaving a good thing alone is best!  With that being said, they still have the best chips and salsa around, and their drink menu always has something new and exciting on it! My new favorite is the Tito's Vodka-rita's, delicious and made perfect everytime. Great for date night or to bring your family!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Cathy W.,"Canal Fulton, OH",195,318,185,1.0,9/9/2017,"I've been to this location several times and typically, if we have a problem with our order, a manager has ALWAYS come by and done whatever necessary to make things right. I mean, it's pretty standard that if a customer has a problem with their order, you want to come by and personally see what can be done, right?!? We got to Chili's around 5:30 on a Friday and there was no wait. We were immediately seated and our server came over to greet us. I had an email coupon for free chips & dip, so I showed the server and we ordered the white spinach queso with no cilantro. Instead of taking drink orders or asking if we wanted anything else, he took off to put in the appetizer.  So we waited about ten minutes before he came back to get our drink order.   As we sat and waited, the droves of people kept coming and all were seated within five minutes if not immediately. All around us, our section filled and instead of having our server, they were served by a VERY efficient female server. After waiting about 20 minutes, our server brought out chips (no dip) and drinks and then took our dinner order. Five or so minutes later, our dip arrived and it was loaded with cilantro.  We had to wait about five minutes to notify our server that we ordered it without cilantro, and he said he'd take it back and bring us a new one without cilantro. Our soup came out about ten minutes later and our server brought a second basket of chips & salsa. We finished our soup and the dip still had not come out. He came to get our bowls and told us that our food would be out soon-- and at that point we told him to just forget the dip. He was thoroughly confused about the comment, like a ""What dip?"" Kinda look on his face. He said he'd find out what happened but he thought we'd already received it (um... no where on the table, dude).  Then the food arrived and while my husband and I had no problem with our order, the kids meals were a mess. The chicken was dried out and rubbery, likely from sitting under the heat lamp. So we had to send them back, while our kids were STARVING from waiting an hour at this point for food. Their ""fresh"" chicken came out about 15 minutes later and was better. The rest of the almost two hour ordeal was fine... but never once did a manager come over to see what happened. The chips & dip would have been free anyway because I had a coupon (and truthfully, the ONLY reason we picked Chili's for dinner was because of the free chips & dip coupon). We were given free dessert to make up for the missed dip (that our server admitted was his fault for not putting in for a new one without cilantro).  It was seriously disappointing and I was extremely annoyed that never once did a manager stop by. The tables around us were turned over with the efficiency of their server doing a phenomenal job... while we sat and waited for food.  This location seriously needs to get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Brian P.,"Butler, PA",70,17,5,3.0,6/10/2017,It's Chili's... location was in a mall so great for shopping. The food was tasty but seems that the summer menu has had an increase in prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton

Sandy L.,"Massillon, OH",14,16,2,5.0,6/4/2017,This is by far the best place to eat...the service is great and fast..My sister and i went for lunch..we both got the bacon chicken ranch quesadilla...it was the bomb...i had a mango ice tea that was good. Great food at a great price. Defiantly will be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Kara G.,"Canton, OH",0,9,,1.0,1/10/2017,"I usually love Chilis but I was very disappointed with this location. Our server Jeffrey was a condescending jerk. He never asked how the food was, never asked if we wanted more drinks, never really returned to the table. We had to flag him down to get the check and again to pay the check he then came back a half hour later to ask which card went to which receipt, and even after we told him i was still charged the wrong amount. I also had to flag him down to put in my to go order which i told him about upfront. The section wasnt busy and he seemed attentive to his other tables just not ours. In the end the food was cold and not good and our dining experience was over 2 hours long due to how hard it was to get our waiters attention. Will likely never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Love H.,"Akron, OH",56,16,,1.0,10/27/2016,"I arrived at 4:45 our waitress is just now getting water and plates to us this is the worse service ever. We asked for more drinks, napkins, plates and cilantro we received all four items twenty minutes later. It took her ten minutes to bring us water. We wanted more margaritas but was afraid we wouldn't get them. Contact me at ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Mark H.,"Canton, OH",57,4,2,5.0,2/27/2015,"Consistently good service and pretty decent Tex Mex at reasonable prices. Try the table side guacamole, fresh and flavorful. Chips are freshly made and have just the right amount of salt.  Ribs are so tender they fall off the bone. The new skillet sides (I have had the cornbread and skillet potatoes) are delicious.  Tara is a great waitress and makes you feel very welcome. Location is pretty busy nights and weekends, but they do have call ahead seating which will cut down the wait in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Jayme M.,"San Clemente, CA",0,103,4,2.0,12/4/2015,"Where to begin.  Let's start with service. It seemed like it was everyone's first day working.  We were told one person was our server but only saw her once and then at the end of our meal. My son got hurt ( he is 20 months old) and not one employee asked if he was ok. Luckily the customers around us were great and understanding ( he was screaming when he fell).  Our food was so so.  Nothing special.   Once we ordered it took forever. I guess we can blame that on it being Friday night and the place was packed. But there were tons of servers. We got charged a ""entertainment"" fee because my daughter used the game thing they provide on the table.  We won't be recommending this place and we won't be eating there again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Brooke R.,"Canton, OH",32,55,8,5.0,6/26/2015,My Mom and I had a great meal here! My steak was perfect which is unusual for most steaks I've had at other restaurants. The mashed potatoes were delish and so was the guacamole. I've been craving the guac since we left. To top it off our waitress was so nice and helpful. And paying on the tablet was really neat and convenient too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Heather F.,"North Canton, OH",0,4,,5.0,8/9/2016,I absolutely love this place!! They always have the best food and the service is quick and staff is friendly!!!!  I always order the trio fajitas!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Joshua K.,"Long Beach, CA",4,11,2,2.0,11/12/2013,"I went here on Veterans day (yesterday) to get my annual free Burger. Maybe she was having a bad day, but I got the distinct impression that my waitress hates Veterans. The only words she said to me were when I placed my order. And she was very curt. She kept pushing me with a negative attitude, ""You ready to order?""; with disdain. After I placed my order, a couple of minutes went by and she brought me my soup. She slid it more or less in front of me, without a word, and just kept walking. She had no more food in her hands, did not go to another customer, and her section did not appear to be very busy. In fact, when I came in, the place was pretty much dead (save the bar and a small family in the back). After I finished my soup, I was brought my burger. It was delivered in the same manner, but even more agressive. She practically threw down my plate of food, without a word or even looking at me, then walked away.  I had to ask the host to find her to get my check. And, when she brought my check, and brought my card back, not a word, not a smile, nothing. It was like she hated me. I did nothing but smile and thank this lady. I even tipped 25 percent of what the original bill would have been before my veterans discount. I will never eat here again, and I hope her car gets a flat tire in a blizzard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Jaime W.,"Horn Lake, MS",20,25,8,4.0,2/15/2015,Haven't been here in a long time glad we came. Ribs were so good wish I had gotten a full rack. Pickles came with husband burger were so good I'm asking for some when I order. The Ziosk was cool.  The host that sat us was a little rude. Server was nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Beau K.,"Alliance, OH",0,3,,5.0,3/3/2015,What's not to love.  The food is always exellent and the service is the same.  Their desserts are also wonderful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Jenn T.,"Canton, OH",0,21,,3.0,2/8/2015,Not true Mexican food but not bad either. There call ahead seating isn't much on weekends as you still have to wait a good half hour. The waitstaff is friendly and really trying to keep up with the demand. They did forget our drinks and when we asked they forgot again. They finally arrived just as the last person in our party finished his meal. Price is average for a chain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Josh M.,"Canton, OH",10,5,,2.0,5/10/2015,Been here at least 4 times. The last two times the service has been awful. Bringing out our entrees before our appetizers? Entrees that are room temperature mind you. Another visit I was part of a 5 person party. 1 person's entree came out 20 minutes after the others. Not to mention incredibly slow service. Definitely not coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
Abby K.,"Akron, OH",35,6,,4.0,4/28/2011,"Chips and salsa are a must!!! Salsa is great!.  Great burgers! Really haven't had anything on the menu that i don't care for. Fun atmosphere, nice place to grab a drink and some food, nice and close to Belden Village mall!  Salad and broccoli cheese soup is a favorite too for me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-canton
