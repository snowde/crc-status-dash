Brian G.,"Spring, TX",424,578,1457,1.0,5/20/2012,"What a pitiful place.  Last time I just had drinks and chips - this time I ordered food.  YUUUKKKK.  Had to wait 40 minutes for a table, 10 minutes to get a drink - it was so busy - there was nothing else open in town.  There is NOITHING good to say about this place, the food was stale, overcooked and AWFUL.  The ribeye was like leather, the pathetic knife they gave me couldn't cut it.  Go to the Walmart next door and buy whatever crap they have (chips, cookies, jerky, anything) - don't even think about eating here.  YYYYYYYYYUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=40
Sam C.,"Carlsbad, NM",0,14,12,4.0,11/9/2013,"I live here so this is about all we have and normally it is decent, service can be spotty, and food is typically good now this place does get packed sometime with even a 45 min wait but u can call ahead and put your name down. If u want a drink while u eat this about your ably option here other than Lucy's but that place even takes longer so it's a chilis plain and simple u get what u order nothing special but definitely a clean place to eat",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=40

Mario S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",60,8,,4.0,6/6/2014,"excellent service and probably among best restaurants in town . I love their honey chipotle chicken crisps. there is hardly any waiting , especially if you are by yourself you can go right to bar and bypass the wait.

Max W.,"Manhattan, NY",4,16,1,5.0,1/13/2012,"This is a Chili's, and it is just like every other one in America. Actually, it's a little bit smaller than most of the other Chili's in America, so the interior is somewhat less spacious, and there is less sitting space. It's also one of the most popular joints in town (and one of the few places open past 8 or 9 p.m.), which makes for a great atmosphere, but also lot of people and a long wait on a Friday night. Under these circumstances, I got my meal to go. My order was missing a side of steamed broccoli, but the manager was quick to rectify the mistake and offered my choice of dessert or side on the house. Everything was quick, friendly and efficient. Except for the forgotten broccoli. But that issue was handled perfectly by the staff. Overall, I'm a happy camper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=40
Ami T.,"Los Angeles, CA",359,734,1142,3.0,6/3/2009,"The only other options?  Chinese buffet or Walmart.   This place was bustling, nice atmosphere, food was alright.  Server was cool.  Missed a corn on our order but otherwise, it was a nice place for dinner in the little town.  A lot of people there though, wait of 30 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=40
Rachael T.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,6,3,2.0,7/27/2013,"The restaurant was being renovated when I came, but that wasn't the worst of it. The late night staff was terrible! They made fun of customers within earshot of the tables, and were very loud and obnoxious. The air was down so low that most of my family didn't even want to eat. And when customers complained, they made fun of them in the back, and turned on the HEAT. This was absolutely ridiculous. Overall, the food was pretty good, the same as any other Chilis, but the servers were awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=40

Happy J.,"Glendale, AZ",17,192,15,2.0,11/15/2009,"If you come by yourself to this Chili's and do not sit at the bar, expect lackluster service. It takes a long time to get drinks refilled, my order taken, or even trying to get the server's attention. There isn't a problem when I visit here with another person. It's only when I sit solo.  This is my third visit to this Chili's to watch NFL Sunday football: twice last season and once the 2009-10 season. All three times I sat at a tall table in the corner. I even tell the server from the initial order that I plan to have appetizers and lunch over the course of the game. That does not seem to make a difference. How poor is service? This is the only review I've written about a Carlsbad, NM business. I don't like to bash the ""home town"" businesses. All my other postings about Carlsbad businesses were articles or health inspection reports from the local newspaper. I will come here again with friends.

Amy L.,"Encanto, AZ",0,2,,4.0,3/17/2014,"Due to the many negative reviews, I felt obligated to write about my experience. First off, I'm not a local, and I could be viewed as a restaurant snob. That being said, Chili's was still a decent place to eat, even when not accounting for the lack of alternate options. The food tasted good, and service was also good.

Emily V.,"Carlsbad, NM",59,1,,2.0,3/1/2014,We used the online menu for the Chili's in Carlsbad and placed a to go order. We were given a total and when we arrived we were told that the two Cobb salads we ordered are from the old menu and they don't have the ingredients!!! It would have been nice to know that before we got off the phone to drive over here. Now we have to wait another 20 minutes for them to make something else while the other items we ordered get cold. Would have left to get something else but we're visiting from out of town and there's nothing but fast food here for take out on a Saturday night.

Joel S.,"San Diego, CA",1327,324,84,5.0,7/22/2008,"Why 5 stars? Because it was open past 8pm.

While I quenched my thirst right next to the takeout, finish my beer, and pay for it, my husband stood there and had half a dozen employees just look at him but not take his order. Well, not even a hello.  All I heard was ""ARE YOU GONNA TAKE MY ORDER OR NOT?!?!?!""   Uh uh... I quickly finished my business and called for a manager to let him know what happened and left as quickly as possible.  Don't know what the deal was with them not wanting to serve him but it was horrendous. How rude for that many staff to look at him (and our daughter) and not serve us.  Thank God we don't live here so we'll NEVER EVER have to come back here again.  Thanks for nothing.

It's hard to find a vegetarian place in this town so we opted for a chain restaurant that we knew had a few veggie options for us.  Food was great, they were able to accommodate vegetarian for us with the enchiladas and combo plates. Beans are also vegetarian which is a plus!

Kelly F.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,6,1,1.0,7/2/2017,"Our server was very attentive and is the only reason I can even give one star for this location.  The food took forever to make it to the table. We ordered pretty basic things like burgers, quesadillas and some kids meals.  Most of our orders were incorrect.  One order of the chicken quesadillas had two wedges with chicken and the rest were beef.  We gave them a plate with 5 wedges left on it.  When they corrected the order, they only gave us four wedges and no sour cream or sides to go with it.  The quesadilla explosion salad had been sitting for a while before they brought it to us because they lettuce was soaked with dressing but the chicken tasted off.  Overall it was just a really poor showing.  When we asked to speak to the manager about the quesadillas, she was very defensive and said we had eaten half of the quesadillas so we only got half back and we had to really push to have the item taken off of our ticket.  Definitely would not eat at this establishment again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7

Amanda J.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,18,6,3.0,4/24/2016,"Finding a restaurant with good service and good food in Carlsbad has become somewhat of a rarity. My experience here today did not surpass my mediocre expectations. From the get-go things did not start off on the right foot. We waited at the front for well over 5 minutes with several waitresses walking by and ignoring us. Finally getting fed up with the lack of service, we decided to seat ourselves. I couldn't help but notice the waitress standing in the back doing nothing as we found ourselves a table... We decided quickly what we wanted, so continued playing the waiting game for our waiter to come take our order. Once she helped us she thankfully remained attentive for the rest of our stay. The food was much better then previous visits, you usually play Russian roulette with the quality of food you'll receive here. With lack of other options on a Sunday afternoon in a town where everything closes down for the weekend, its play the game or dont eat.

Aryan R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,32,,1.0,4/25/2017,"Terrible experience. Employees need to be trained specifically to be this insulting to the customers. I have been on several road trips throughout the wild west of USA and this was the only one experience that truly stands out as bad.  1. Firstly the waitress said she does not have proper glasses and hence gave us soda and water in a To-Go plastic cups. (while everyone else in the restaurant had proper glasses)  2. When my wife ordered Fajita the waitress returned with chicken on the pan and cups with guacamole and cream etc. She forgot Tortillas !  3. When we pointed out that she had not brought Tortillas she did not even apologised but said ""You want Tortillas? and then returned with foil wrapped tortillas. ""  4. Now I pointed out that we still did not have plates to eat on ! Without apologizing she brought plates but did not place them on table. Instead she gave it in our hand. (That is really really insulting if the waitress just gives you the plates and expects you to put them on table.)  5. That is not all. She had forgotten beans and rice too. This time she showed some remorse and said ""yeah we keep forgetting the rice"". (But not apology).  6. I asked for a refill for my coke. She then asked ME to open the lead of the cup so she could go and refill it ! (People typically bring a new glass).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7

The food however, was the worst Chili's food I've ever eaten. Found a chunk of avocado in my ranch, found a mushroom and chunk of onion in another side of cheese sauce. The pretzels that were supposed to go with the cheese sauce were burnt. The sliders were supposed to have bacon on them, I found the bacon on the plate outside of the slider. Along with that, the buns of the sliders were burnt. Again, waitress was good.

However, I will not be going back to this location. In short, it provided poor service and execution across the board. The wait was long to be seated. The server was more non-existent than anything. We waited 40 minutes for 1 of the appetizers and 45 minutes for the other (the entrees took an hour) . The steaks were over cooked and a side salad that we ordered never came out. To make matters worse, the server didn't apologize once.  The only positive note was that the manager was reasonable and understanding. With Chili's being a restaurant chain, I think it's fair to say that customers should expect a certain amount of consistency across the board. Perhaps it was just this server, but we won't be going back to this Chili's location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20
Avner M.,"Henderson, NV",2623,535,34,3.0,1/21/2013,"As far as Chili's go, this one is interesting.  You can't expect much as it is in a small town which has the competition of a Denny's and Ihop. We walked in and the hostess doubles as a bus person clearing and cleaning tables.  You will be passed by several employees while you stand and wait at the door for a seat.  Oh, DONT EXPECT ANY OF THEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU, as none of them will say a word, they will just pass you by. When the hostess finally comes over, she will ask you how many and walk away again.  When she finally returns, she will ask you if you are ready yet (as though she has been waiting on you). Once seated, you may want to ask if they have their signature dish, RIBS...they were out of ribs, so I ordered a ribeye.  The cook is just that a cook.  Steaks are over cooked and it takes 2 times to get it done right. Like I said in the beginning, it is what it is, and when your competition is a Denny's and IHOP, you really don't need to set your expectations very high to over achieve.  Average is acceptable here.   The best point I can say is you will get a hot meal and you will not be poisoned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20

She was extremely friendly, continually checked on us, and kept the sodas and chips and salsa coming as we waited for our food. The food was good and what you normally would expect from Chillis, the only reason for one star less was the pretzel buns were hard as rocks. Must have just been a little old.

Susan H.,"Harrisburg, PA",21,70,42,1.0,5/20/2014,"I really feel like is shouldn't have to rate a Chili's, being that it's a national chain that should have standards, but this location's standards are so low that it warrants a review. I'm also usually a very good tipper, often in the 18-20% range. This was so terrible I was a 0% tipper. Here is the saga of how our waitress lost out on her tip. Our party of 2 was seated pretty quickly (although they did have to clean one of the half-a-dozen dirty, empty tables to do so) and the place was only semi-busy. Not crazy or anything, but not empty either. After 10 minutes of no waitress we asked the hostess where she was. It still took her 5 more minutes to arrive... with excuses. Minus 5%. We both ordered iced tea, the queso appetizer, and I ordered the crispy-style chicken crispers (I remember back when there was one type: crispy... but that's another story.) with honey mustard dipping sauce and subbed sweet potato fries instead of the regular fries and asked for no corn. She asked if I wanted the sweet potato fries instead of the corn also and I said no, just one substitution. (It's a $0.50 up-charge for them and I knew I wasn't hungry enough for twice the fries.) Hubby got the crispers honey-chipotle style, the corn, and subbed in a side salad with ranch dressing. It took about 5 minutes for our iced tea to arrive and another 5 minutes for the queso to arrive. Since those arrived in an almost timely fashion I ordered the sparkling pomegranate margarita and DH ordered the Long Island iced tea. They also arrived in a relatively timely fashion (about 5 minutes later) and were delicious. She said our food was almost ready and would be out soon. Things were looking up: no tip deduction. Then 15 minutes went by. Minus 5%. After 10 more minutes went by (total visit at this time: about 55 minutes) we flagged her down to ask where our food was. She made some excuse about the sweet potato fries delaying things (hah!) and promised things would be out soon. She asked if we wanted any of our drinks refilled and we said no but I asked for water. Then 15 minutes went by. No water. Minus 5%. (She's basically at a maximum 5% here.) Our food finally arrived!! She couldn't remember (subtext: didn't put it in with the order) which dipping sauce I had wanted and brought the honey mustard that I wanted and the honey-chipotle as well. The food was all correct and our chicken crispers were good, but the sweet potato fries were inconsistently cooked. Some were just right and some were under-done. I gave up on getting my water. Minus 5%. Upon seeing the bill, we were charged for double sweet potato fries. Grrr. I would've contested that, but we really just wanted to get out of there, as we'd been there for 90 minutes by then. So they have these great new pay-at-the-table kiosks that give you a survey as soon as you pay. We liked that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20

Debbie H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,3,,3.0,5/31/2016,Well in NM just remember to have your Drivers License on you to be able to Order a Drink!  Really people I am 60 years old!...the waitress  would not let me order due to them losing their license if she served me...Well my husband ordered his and SHE DIDN'T ASK TO SEE HIS...SHE TOLD HIM WHEN HE GOT HIS DRINK SHE FIGURED HE HAD HIS ON HIM...REALLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO CHECK ID'S THEN CHECK THEM ALL!!!!!!!  To say the least we had different waitress coming around until we were ready to go...I think she knew I had caught her in a little lie of not checking all.  To bad I wasn't under cover state department...they wouldn't have their license now...if what she said was true...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20
Mike A.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,36,6,2.0,9/3/2013,"Why am I writing a Yelp review of Chilis? Why is anyone reading a Yelp review of Chilis? Why did I eat at a Chilis? Oh yeah, because it's Carlsbad, New Mexico, and nothing else was open on a Sunday. I wish I could write a Yelp review of Carlsbad. It would say, ""Don't go to Carlsbad.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20
Kris P.,"Lodo, Denver, CO",34,19,3,2.0,11/29/2013,"Yikes! It's sad this is one of the only places to eat in Carlsbad.  Service was good. Atmosphere is way too loud. Food was pretty gross. I had a hamburger (medium) which was blackened... Mmmm I would recommend going to church street grill or somewhere like that for food. Quicker, cheaper and better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20

R.J. R.,"Taylor, MI",0,30,,1.0,3/30/2016,"This place needs a new manager....or owner.  Wait staff were trying to do a good job, but between the wait, poorly bussed tables, lousy food...and worst of all, dealing with the console to order and pay, this was a negative experience.  That is probably a corporate issue, so listen up!!  I doubt I will ever go to a Chilies again.  We came into another small town  in CA with limited eateries on our two month road and saw a Chiies.  No thanks.  Ate at a Panera.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20
Annette G.,"Lubbock, TX",0,13,,1.0,1/20/2015,Wish I could rate a zero Service sucks but where is management!?  The bathroom are NASTY and the floor is too.  The kitchen seemed pretty gross too from what I could see as I walked by to the restroom.  It was so bad I sent in a complaint to Chili's headquarters.   Food is mediocre...This place used to be good...Now I wouldn't recommend it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20
Melissa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,77,,1.0,5/7/2012,"I can't remember that last time I ate at a Chili's before this, so I can't really compare it to another Chili's.   I can say this:    It was located practically in the parking lot of The Hampton Inn that we were staying at and given all the road construction in Carlsbad at the time, we decided to just go here.  It's a chain restaurant, so weren't expecting anything phenomenal, but we were expecting basic service and food quality.   We got there and apparently Chili's is the happening place to be in this town.  I have no idea why, unless all the other eateries are horrible.   The hostess was probably late teens/ early twenties and she had her friend just hanging out laying down on the seating in the waiting area.  We were told that we could take any of the tables in the bar area on a first come first serve basis, so they directed us that way when one became available.   Fine, no problem.  I've eaten in plenty of bars in my time.  Except that this table was filthy and there had been some sort of a major spill under the table.  They expected us to sit there in that state.  I nearly had to pitch a fit to get someone to clean it.   I ordered the potato soup and a side salad.  The soup must have been sitting out or something, because there was nothing soupy about it.  The cheese had crusted on the potatoes and when I put my spoon in it I could practically lift the entire contents of the bowl at one time.   We also ordered margaritas which came in mugs akin to the kind you would use for root beer floats.  Mugaritas.   Something from that night gave me food poisoning.  I really couldn't pin point what.  Maybe the salad was bad?  Maybe it was the three day old potato soup?   Go to Walmart and buy snacks.  You'd be better off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20

Sam S.,"Gila Bend, AZ",0,24,8,2.0,4/12/2014,"Chilis has always been good to me but not this place. Beer was warm and the staff horrible!  We had them put our food to go, it looked like they just dumped it in the box.   Waitress wouldn't even look at us when we ordered.  By the way, I am not local.  I wouldn't  even recommend going there for a beer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20
Mariah S.,"Tempe, AZ",8,27,57,1.0,6/22/2015,"Walked in and was sat immediately.  The place was pretty busy but that didnt stop them from giving fast service which was good. The place closes at 10 and apparently they have the rule where you cannot have alcohol on the table past 10. So we order a drink and chugged it then we tried waving our waitress down twice to get another drink before 10 and she finally comes over at 9:50 to tell us that the last call was at 9:45 so we couldn't get more to drink. It would have been nice to know when the last call was, so we cpuldnt get another drink. Then as soon as 10 hit she took all the alcohol off everyones table and had a slight attitude towards people. Anyways the rest of the time the service felt rushed to get everyone out. Then a family came in at around 9:59 to eat dinner and yea that can be annoying for restaurant employees (I would know) they sat down behind us and the server told them that they cannot order alcohol but the guests asked them to check with the manager. The manager comes out and rudely tells them no then tells them that the host shouldnt have sat you anyways because we close at 10. You should never, NEVER tell a paying guest that. EVER . So they left. We got our food after 20 mins from ordering. I got the pork fajitas.  The display of the food was very sloppy and of course rushed.  The hot plate did not even come out sizzling like it is suppose too. Overall this was the worst experience ive had at a Chili's.  Unfortunately a lot of food places in this area have bad service. In the end, I would suggest going to ihop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20
Dale N.,"San Clemente, CA",2,29,,4.0,7/3/2015,"Extremely crowded location, but found that if you ordered online and pick up at the to-go area, not bad at all. Burger and onions rings were pretty good. Try this place if you want to take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20
Tomas G.,"Phoenix, AZ",28,9,1,1.0,7/22/2015,"Chaotic!!!  We wanted to have a few drinks and some appetizers.  The host (female) rolled her eyes at us as we walked in. I guess we bothered her, then our server informed us that all drinks have to be removed off the table at 10pm.  It was 9:15. We felt rushed, not the Chili's I'm use to.  So we ordered some chips and salsa, but was informed out of chips and they can not make any more.   Fine we order food, the order was wrong.  5 min later the table to the right of us ordered chips and salsa and the got it!  Magic chips I guess.  The table next to us complained and talked to the manager because they also ordered chips and salsa and was lied to.  The manger explained that they did have chips and he didn't know why she said that.  She knew we over heard the conversation and didn't have any apologies for us.  We didn't eat our food due to the whole experience.  Just a disappointment for a chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carlsbad-7?start=20
