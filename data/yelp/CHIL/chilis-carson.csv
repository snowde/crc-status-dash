Julz S.,"Long Beach, CA",187,34,97,5.0,11/11/2017,"We came out to dinner with our kids (our daughter and her Boyfriend currently serving as Marines) for Veterans Day.  We walked in and were greeted with the hostess Shanice I let her know we are here for our 2 kids for Veterans Day she said ok.  We were seated in Brenda's section who came to our table with a smile and got our drinks really quick, very impressed.  Our server was a little overwhelmed with how crowded it was and did her very best also had a helper named Desiree and she was able to take our empty plates away.   Food was prepared EXACTLY how we all ordered them and was so very good that we ate everything and no leftovers to be taken home.  Ordered our desert and it was eaten quickly as well, impressed because it was fresh and still hot (we ordered the skillet cookie).  We had a little issue with miscommunication from hostess to server but was quickly taken care of. Our server spoke to her manager who was Patrick tonight and he quickly came to our table to Thank our Marines for their services and took care of the little issue with no problem.  I was very impressed by Patrick because he was so involved with his staff and helping clearing tables with a little dancing and clapping, he was even singing. (Having server experience myself for more than 20 yrs I love to see when managers are quick to step up for their servers now that's Great Management)  I will definitely come back to visit and refer others to this Chili location because they think very highly of their paying customers.   Thank You Chili's staff for making tonight a very SPECIAL  Veterans Day for our 2 Marines.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson
Tiffany B.,"Oakland, CA",110,158,287,3.0,11/3/2017,"I'll give 3 stars since I'm getting extra generous. I wanted to enjoy the $5 presidente Margarita. I ordered a strawberry but when it came it wasn't in the blue shaker but av regular 20oz glass, not even a margarita glass! I couldn't taste the strawberry flavor and it didn't have the kick that I had in the one I ordered weeks ago at a different location. It tasted funny. The server asked if I wanted them to remake it but then she found out that it's premade. So I went with the blueberry pineapple margarita and that was tasty but you couldn't taste the tequila. I saw 3 containers of that as well. So clearly they don't make each drink to order but prep everything before hand. The chicken and waffle sliders were good as well as the house salad. On a Thursday night don't expect attentive service, although they were friendly. I don't think I'll return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson
Leslie L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",11,14,,5.0,10/6/2017,"I had to take a time out to review our experience here. We are from Orange County and were in the area for the Eagles VS Chargers game. We were driving around before the game to find somewhere to get food and a few drinks before the game. We went into the BWW in the same shopping center and it was packed! So we kept driving and ran into this Chili's.  When we walked in, there was only a few tables open in the bar area so we grabbed a booth. Even though most of the seats were full with other football fans, our service was so fast! Our waitress was very attentive and our drinks and food came out a lot quicker than I expected for the decent size crowd in the bar area.  One person who stood out to us was the manager on duty, Patrick (we stopped him before we left to ask his name). The entire time we were sitting there, he was hustling and helping out anywhere he could. He was cleaning behind the bar, pouring beers, delivering food. I was very impressed with the leadership he showed. I work in hospitality management and that's the kind of person we'd want working in our establishment. Great job Patrick! Way to be a role model to your team, I know from experience that team members work harder when they feel supported by their supervisor.  We had an excellent time and well definitely be back if we're in the area again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson
Amber M.,"Anaheim, CA",502,126,461,4.0,1/13/2018,"There's nothing fancy about Chili's. However, I do like this location in Carson. First of all, I mostly go there for happy hour which is pretty good. They have a nice big screen tv with sports as usual, booths, tables and a bar. There's ample parking and the service is average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson
Nelson M.,"Gardena, CA",67,148,49,2.0,8/2/2017,I'm not one to leave that many bad reviews but this one has to be done. Was at the bar self seating area with my little girl. Well we waited at a table for about 15-20min before someone cleaned it. Then the woman server took another 10-15min to get our order. I ordered a michelada which I have before plenty of times here and I wasn't sure if it was just beer or a michelada it had no taste of spicy so I'm guessing it was plain beer. Idk.  The service was not there today maybe the server didn't want to work idk but it was by far one of the worst experiences I have ever had at this chillis. I will always come back since I love there food but if it continues with this horrible service I definitely will not be back and go to the Torrance one instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson

Kiyeon K.,"Los Angeles, CA",160,133,80,3.0,9/23/2017,"Ew. There were screaming babies at most of the tables. I guess this is where families come cuz kids are allowed. Parents don't care if their kids are screaming here. I think Dennys is even better. Food is whatevers. Nothing bad. Nothing great. Portions are just ok. Food is in the $10-$20 range.  If u want to enjoy happy hour, u need to sit at the bar. It's crowded there. Loud too. People watching sports on The TV screen. Waiters are horrible. U need to hunt them down. Soooooooo annoying!!!!! It took about 10 minutes each time to find our waiter. Ugh. Would I come back? No. Never. Worst experience ever",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson

I really should come here more often than I do but then it may not be as special as it always is. I usually sit at the bar because 9 times out of 10 when I come here, it's just me by myself. The bartender that goes by the name Chris always has my drinks on point! Finger foods are a must so I always get them. Entire staff is friendly and the establishment is always clean.

Ernesto G.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,3,,1.0,12/21/2017,"I been to many chillis but this is one of the worse, party of 18 and only one server to help .. had a long waiting period for service and refills , waited almost 20min to get my last drink , was not offered napkins , or utensils,  had to grab from other tables.. had to put all appetizers plates to the other tables to make way for our plates after 20 to 30 min waiting for someone to take them .. if it wasn't for the male server or the  front female  desk host I wouldn't let them get the 50dollar tip I left .. and hope they gave that to the cooks cause the servers didn't do crap but go gossip and cry in the  restrooms, all  while everyone is waiting for the plates and service..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson
Alberto A.,"Inglewood, CA",161,245,25,1.0,5/31/2017,"I haven't been to Chili's in awhile. After today, I don't think I ever will. We waited to be seated in a very unorganized fashion. When we arrived we were the only ones waiting. The hostess told us we would be seated in 5-10 minutes. 5 minutes later the manager came by (other groups had arrived) and started taking names but didn't bother to ask who was there first and took down another groups name ahead of us. When we were seated we were asked for our drink orders. About a minute later we were asked what we wanted to order but we weren't ready and asked for more time. 15 minutes passed and no one came back. The manager even came by and instead of taking our order asked on his two-way who was in charge of our table. We left. I will never be back. You all suck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson
Susan B.,"Gardena, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/10/2017,"Main Waitress friendly but the food was cold, the guacamole was dark, the cup used for my drink smelled funny.  The others waiters had no idea what table the food or drinks goes to etc.  Never going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson
Jasmine C.,"Carson, CA",17,65,222,1.0,3/11/2017,Our waiter was the best he helped me pick the right drink and I will always come back because of him. Last time I didn't enjoy it so much and that probably made my food taste bland this time everything was perfect  I really had a great night with my husband and 2 drinks some appetizers and called it a night felt great. He was super attentive and had a great attitude when I remember his name I will edit my post thanks to him I will go back and hope to get his section again  UPDATE:  As you can see I was kind enough before to leave a good review from a prior visit but now sadly this place has gone down hill way down they no longer serve my margarita in a mug the waiter said they never did that check my picture I have proof you do! But okay and the Fries were old we didn't finish just sucks he checked on us less then a handful of times our drinks too way to long and he blamed the bar poor service overall,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson

And this is the first time I've received terrible customer service from the waiters/waitresses and the MANAGER. Manager was upset that I was not happy with how my food came out. Food came out warm close to cold like it had been sitting in the back. And queso dip had gotten so cold that it was forming blocks of cheese.

Isabel K.,"Carson, CA",64,32,13,1.0,11/14/2017,"I can see why this Chili's only has 2 stars. The managers are rude with no people skills. I asked if my hubby and I can wait at the bar while we wait for a table, she flat out said they have no room that we have to wait outside.  An overweight Hispanic manager did not care on her tone of speaking.

Way too much seasoning, I tried wiping it off with napkin but still couldn't eat it. Took it home and rinsed it under water!!  The salad consisted mostly of iceberg lettuce.  That place does not know how to make it look remotely appetizing. McDonald's salads win the salad battle between these two places.

Never in life have I seen a manager noticeably pissed just cause someone walks in to order takeout . Lol  This guy is seriously ticked off at life it's self. Even the very nice young girl who ended up helping because the manager clearly didn't even know how to work their own pos station gave me a smirk as if to ignore him. So this shift manager sucks lol. Okey getting home to open my Togo container and the nachos were disgusting. They didn't even give me shredded beef like I asked for, instead we got some type of chorizo ground beef mixture that was not edible at all.

Beyond that, it is a Chili's.  If you have been to one, you should have an opinion if you like the food or not.  It isn't my favorite chain, but it is easy to find something to eat on the menu I want to try.  Plus, they make my go-to home recipe for Margaritas (OK, I stole their recipe).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=20

My waiter wasn't really trying too hard to make sure I was happy and would pass by once every full moon.  The food was mediocre. My girlfriend and I ordered chips and salsa realizing that it would be awhile before we'd see our food. We were pleasantly surprised to find what looked to be bits of a chip within the salsa which grossed us out. After asking the waiter to replace it. The hilarious part was that he brought us out our food before realizing that he forgot all about the salsa. The environment and overall establishment was a dirty mess.

Leslie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",345,196,145,3.0,2/15/2017,"Ok so let's start with the customer service. I will be as honest as possible as I write this review.  First the hostess, was awesome a guy and girl and they were both just pleasant and polite. My cousin and I sat in the Bar area and it was nice and not crowed or loud and had just the right amount of people in the section. We came here last Sunday for happy hour. Our waitress was really nice as well, BUT she threw me off with padding her head over and over and over again. It started making me nerves because she was handling food as well. She continuously scratched her scalp as well. So much I don't believe she realized she did it as much as she did. Again, it made me nervous. Nothing is wrong with weaves, but when it starts to inch as much as she was padding her head, a good wash is terribly needed.  As for my food, I got a veggie burger and fries and oh my....the veggie patty was phenomenal!!!  It was seasoned so well and I enjoyed it a lot. I also got a Mango Margarita and oh my again, it was yummy, strong, and delicious. If I wasn't driving I would have gotten 3-4 drinks but I only purchase the one.  Nonetheless the entire experience was good besides the padding of the head. It grossed me out which is why I only gave 3 stars. An itchy scalp and food doesn't mix in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=60

Tonya H.,"Inglewood, CA",0,10,,1.0,2/8/2017,"Congratulations to Carson Chilis on being thee worst dining experience I've had in 20 years.  Our waitress Adriana was distracted, unable to multitask, forgetful and had a poor attitude.  She was more concerned with the next table over; where two young men was flirting with her and another server.   She was irritated that we wasn't ready but that just the beginning. She never brought the item my niece requested for her soup, napkins or refilled any beverages. Another person in our party subbed French fries for onions rings which came after he was done eating his burger. She said, ""oh I think somebody else took them; I didn't bring them?""  She brought the ranch dressing my niece asked for, when the food was already partially eaten and just rolled her eyes when we requested some to go.   My mom's soup was cold. She never came back to the table to see if we needed anything. She placed the ""to go"" bag on a plate in some sauce. It was so bad we was too fearful to request anything else from her.  While seated at the table I called to speak to a manager from my cell phone but there was no answer.  Really?!?!  Now I know why the servers are so subpar.  Finally, Vicki a manager is flagged down. Vicki is a manager who is clearly overwhelmed, unaware and has no clue about restaurant management or hospitality.  Get it together Chilis.  The finale: my family was so upset they gave me the money and started getting ready to go because we waited almost 30 minutes for her to come back to close the check. Then she appears because she thought we was going to walk out. Smh. She claimed our gift card was decline when there was plenty of money on it.  After paying for that disappointing meal. We ran outa there. Never to return again. Really?!?! Carson Chilis is terrible.  The only nice person was the young lady taking names as the host. I told her to be encouraged and don't stay here. She was the only light in that dump. We gave her our server's tip. Go to any Chilis but this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=60

The waitress came over to say she would be right with us.  20 minutes later, she came and took the drink order. Drinks came out average time.  15 minutes later she came ti take our order.  We ordered and 10 minutes later the my son's food and the appetizer came out. Then nothing else.   So my sister in law ask for a manager. HE went back to ask about the food.  Then brings out the wrong order. Then the the manager comes out.  He apologizes and says the food will be right out and offers a discount is 25 percent on the food. We talk him into 50%. The food comes and he brags about how fresh the food is and apologizes again. We proceed to eat. My sister goes to bite into her corn on the cob and in was ICE cold like it just got out of the freezer. Needless to say they comp our meal.

What it lacks is an atmosphere.  Eating here on a Friday night is like being rushed through a busy train station.

Waitress was polite enough came and took our drink order but when the drinks came my husband didn't get his. I asked again for his coke and a water was brought out. When we ordered our appetizers I asked a third time for his drink before we finally got it. When we received our silverware 3 sets had to be sent back due to still having food on them, along with a couple of cups. When the food came out two dishes were dropped and those members of our party had to wait which is obviously understandable. What we didn't understand was why it took another 20-30 minutes before they were able to get their food. Seeing as they were dropped when everyone else at the table was already eating, replacing those plates should have been priority over other tables. When the last plate was finally brought we were offered a free dessert however no one was interested so I asked for both meals to be comped seeing as our experience started out bad from the get go.

I literally spent 300.00 with my employees a day before, and we had ehhhh ok service. So i decided to cone back to meet friends and i encountered this nightmare. First off every single employee that is employed there is trained to provide shitty service, and the manager condones this behavior.

My wife had to take home and rinse the concoction off the ribs before eating. And  to top it off we bought 2 $50 gift certificates where we were supposed to get $10 gift certificate per each $50 one. Well We got the 2 $10 certs but they actually charged us $10 each for them .  What a joke! We don't normally look too hard at our receipts but luckily we saw this crazy error.

Rafeek Y.,"Glendora, CA",61,168,134,2.0,2/6/2017,"Stopped by with a large party on Saturday night and the service could have been better. We called ahead and asked for a table for 13. We later changed it to 16. They informed us that 13 of us can sit at one table and the rest can sit at adjacent booths and once the table next to us was available, we can sit there. Totally understandable and accommodating. After providing us a table (for 12 not 13) we sat around for 20 minutes before anyone even asked if we had been helped. Also, there was only 1 adjacent booth which seated 2 people which meant a couple of us were just standing around waiting for the table next to us to clear up. That was pretty awkward.  While the server was helpful he seemed totally overwhelmed. Service was really slow and we had to wait 10-15 minutes between soda refills and tortillas (for the fajitas). I understand its Saturday night and their busy, but the manager could have gotten our server some help or taken another table of off his plate so he can focus on a large party. When the food finally did come, it was all very good. I tried the steak, fajitas, and tacos...everything was on point. They get bonus points for splitting the checks and not charging an insane mandatory gratuity (like Tony Roma's).

Kelly R.,"Long Beach, CA",8,39,83,3.0,3/29/2016,"I often find myself in a predicament when meeting my LA/ Southbay friends for drinks. Through the years, we established that the City of Carson is the PERFECT half way point between the Torrance/ Southbay area and Downtown LBC. Its very easy to get to and also right off both the 91 and 405 freeways. However, aside from IKEA , this city offers absolutely NOTHING to civilization or humankind. Well except for Chilis of course.  REMINDER FOR YOU FANCY FOLKS: This place is a CHAIN RESTAURANT, so please don't come here expecting anything  spectacular. FYI- Like most other chain restaurants, hardly anything is actually made fresh. Most sauces, soups, etc are frozen and NOT made in house.  Ok so upon arriving here with no expectations/ appetite, i'd have to my overall experience was OK. Not LBC's George's Greek GOOD, but not Compton's TGIFriday's BAD either.  FOOD: 3/5 They have a few appetizers and drink specials for abt 3-6 bucks each- not too shabby. We got the southwestern eggrolls and the chips and guac. Guac was bland and under seasoned- typical. The southwestern egg rolls tasted weird and stale like they came out of somebodies microwave, but ill digress.  DRINKS: 3/5 I played it safe and stuck with Pino Grigio ($3.79 each)  and my friend got the sunset margarita(NOT on HH menu, abt 8 bucks) As i predicted, the margarita was all sugar- no liquor. BOOOO.  SERVICE- 4/5 Our food came quickly after ordering. Servers are friendly and attentive. Another plus is that they have mini kiosks on all of the tables at the bar, so we did not have to wait to order more food/ drinks or to get our bill.   FINAL THOUGHTS: This is literally a no -frills type of place that serves the sole purpose of meeting a friend for a brief catch up over drinks. Don't come here HANGRY- you WILL leave sad and disappointed. And stick with wine or basic cocktails/ well drinks. Until Carson steps its game up and opens more happy hour spots, my southbay friends and i will be returning here for an occasional drink or two.

I don't like onions, which comes with the salad, due to the pico de gallo, but I couldn't even taste the onions, which was perfect for me.

D C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,10,1,1.0,3/6/2016,"Now I understand why the rating at this restaurant is so BAD! Probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my whole entire life. Went to this restaurant and the place wasn't busy at all. The host failed to greet us because she was too busy talking to another employee.  Not only did she gave us a wait time of 15 minutes, but we didn't get seated until 30 minutes after being there. Like I said, the place was not busy. Understaffed maybe? We then got a waitress with a bad attitude.  Her name started with an 'M' (she was too irrelevant for me to remember her full name).  There was just too much attitude in this server I can't even comprehend. How did she even get this job?! I understand being miserable at work, but this lady took things to a whole new level of misery.  Not only was she RUDE but she got my order WRONG. How can one person mess up so much?! Please, rid her of the misery she has & let her go do the dishes so she won't ruin people's experience again.. But then again she'd probably leave stains on the dishes and ruin people's experiences anyways. Needless to say I will not be returning. My advice don't eat here unless you want to curse at the staff & have your order incorrectly placed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=80

Service was really slow, which was irritating because we didn't have much time.  In fact we had ordered a few more drinks & they never even came so we had to wait to flag down the server before we could even pay.  Several tables surroundings us had to flag employees down to find out if they could be helped, to pay their checks, and to complain about how long it was taking. I couldn't figure out if if was because it was understaffed or mismanaged, but something was definitely wrong.

Cj S.,"Long Beach, CA",53,99,548,1.0,10/24/2015,"It was already bad as soon as we sat down. It's supposed to be a nice and a great dinner for my Mother's bday yet it didn't turn out that way. I normally will find something good about the place to replace the bad experience. Since it was my Mother's bday,I had asked our server,Maria to see if she can do a little something after our dinner and she was all for it saying they will come and do the whole shabang with an ice cream. Awesome! So,here we go! We ordered 2 orders of their 2 for $20 deals which you get an appetizer and your choice of 2 entrees and we also ordered beers and side salads. We didn't even get the appetizers for awhile. I,for one was starvin' like Marvin' and was already getting a mean headache from just waiting. Finally,the side salads came and yet no appetizers. The server didn't anticipate that we would need small plates and utensils. Don't you think you would have done that before the appetizers came out? (Smh) And bam, 1 appetizer down and one more to go. The order of everything wasn't coming out right. After the appetizer, then we get one of the entree's then another then an appetizer? Hello! They are appetizers for a reason yet the 2nd one was delivered with our main entrees. Whatever! I was hungry!   Service sucks and our server had no personality whatsoever as if she didn't even want to be there. She was MIA most of the time that another server had to come and check on us. Food is mediocre and I devoured my baby back ribs like a cave man. So,we were all done with our dinner and we waited for her to check on us. She asked if we wanted desserts and we said no. I just wanted for her to come out with what we've talked about. Minutes passed and nothing! I waited for her again yet she was already too busy with another table and seemed like she was in a totally different world. All she did was ask if we were familiar with the kiosk computer on our table so we can pay the bill. Wow! This was one shitty dinner for my Mother's bday.

Chili's was so warm and inviting I had a blast eating here with my friends and family I'm back in Carson my hometown celebrating life and I'm loving it.    My friend is very ill and this is where she wanted to eat she invited me and I was happy to be here for her.  Our party of 15 was amped and ready for a good time.   These are a few of the things we ordered.  Triple orders of guacamole salsa and chips the guacamole was buttery and full of flavor the salsa was standard and tasty, the chips were light and crunchy and held up well under that thick luscious guacamole it was soo good I couldn't stop eating it.  We enjoyed platters of hot wings, egg rolls and mozzarella sticks that the tray was  devoured and they ordered more.    We enjoyed crispy fried onion rings with an assortment  of dipping sauces the onion rings were a bit greasy but tasted great.  I ordered a triple cheese pizza and added mushrooms it was crispy cheesy and delicious.  I had a refreshing watermelon lemonade and the refills were free.  My sister had a blueberry infused pineapple margarita she said it was delicious and strong.  Several friends ordered patron martinis with these cute mini patron refill bottles and the neatest little frosted glass everyone who ordered them loved the tasty cocktail.  My sweet friend enjoyed a few bites of grilled chicken and shrimp skewers chips and salsa she was very tired and never once did she complain. My sister's entree was steak seafood and salad her meal was wrapped to go after a few bites, she says it was perfect and that her son will enjoy the rest. Lol I ordered a slice of cheesecake to go it had two sides of strawberry sauce the cheesecake tasted alright it was a bit too dense and wasn't very flavorful.  I poured on the strawberry sauce and Kapow the flavor was kicked up a notch that strawberry sauce was fantastic.   Our party ordered way too much food and I didn't dare ask to photograph anyone's plate of food for fear of getting my fingers bitten these girls don't play. Lol Everyone loved the food and our poor waitress was kept on her toes with our huge party she brought out the food in a timely manner and was constantly refreshening our drinks.   We left her a huge tip and she deserved it. We have no complaints whatsoever our friend got out of the house and enjoyed herself in a restaurant that allowed us to talk and enjoy our food without being rushed we all had a fantastic time.  I'm giving them 5 stars and this restaurant deserves it, we were treated very well and the service was flawless.  I will definitely come back for that delicious tortilla soup.

She was not professional in any way and didnt write anything down. I told her you must be good to not write down our order. Her replied was just a nod with an attitude. We order chips as an appetizer so we assumed they would be brought to us in a reasonable time. We waited for 45 mins until I saw the manager pass by. I told the manager we have been waiting here for 45 mins plus 25 mins to be seated. The service here is very bad and slow. Our waitress hasn't been back since she took our order. It would be nice if she brought us our appetizer. We are going to leave and not return to this Chilis.  The manager was apologetic. She walked back to the kitchen and brought back our food. The manager became our waitress. Our original waitress then came out but didnt help us. The manager was very nice and apologetic. However, even though the manager tried to make things right we would not spend our money their again. We didnt get out of there until 9:15.

After our group was seated we waited from 9:46pm to 10:21pm before one of us decided to get up and ask the hostess if our table has a server?!?!  She said she would call someone. More waiting.... No one came. Not one person came to at least take our drink order. So we got up and left. Why eat at a place where you won't enjoy your food just because the first part of the whole dining out experience was ruined by not having adequate service starting from the beginning.  We were sitting in the regular dining area. Half of that area was empty. I don't understand how everyone around us was approached by a server but us. It didn't look busy because half the place was empty for a Friday night. Except for the bar area. That was full.  Insufficient staff? (For a Friday night?) Who knows? We still should have been greeted by our server telling us he or she would be right with us in a moment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=120

There's not a lot of customers either. Many seats were vacant. We asked the hostess why there was a waiting time. She said that they are short of staff right now because they didn't think that there would be much people coming in tonight?? What?? Anyways, the management should've done something about this. The food and drinks here are good. Thats why we decided to wait a little more. We tried to patiently. While we were waiting we already scanned thru the menu and as soon as we were seated, we ordered right away. Drinks were served right away and food came within minutes. 10 mins or so.  Menu-wise. I don't see a problem. I always get the Mex bowl. And it always satisfies me. Good portion and taste for the price. Margaritas are good too, a lot to choose from.  Also, the fact that we can pay the bill with that mini kiosk that they have on the table is convenient. No need to look for a server and give you your bill. You can reorder and refill drinks on that. View some desserts and some drinks. It has games you can purchase for 99cents to keep you or the kids busy while you wait for your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=120

We did see one server drop a $hitload of chips next to our table.

At least 8 employees looked down at and walked by the chips on the floor without picking them up. I mean, what is this? The Roadhouse Grill where you throw peanut shells on the floor?

I noticed one waitress swept under tables, and swept (using the broom) a bottle of ketchup from under one table along with other trash. Instead of taking the bottle and trashing it, she puts it back onto the table for another innocent patron to use it. How unsanitary is that???? I was disgusted. I asked to speak to a manager, in which a manager named Andre came out and heard my complaint. Didn't even get to finish my story, he rudely walks away and goes and removed the bottle from the table. No apology, no rectification, no nothing... is that awesome customer service or what? I immediately wrote corporate and will never come back. This was gross and management not rectifying this or accommodating or acknowledging my complaint was the icing on the cake. Never again!! Made me question the utensils and condiments on my table. People urinate and sometimes poop on the floor in the restrooms and walk out to the communal area that she swept, and to think she used the groom to get a bottle of ketchup from under the table and conveniently puts it back on the table for people to use... yummm how appetizing is that???

They decided on Chili's and this was the closest one. Because no one wants to be on a date with their mom, the kids ate in the dining area and I sat at the bar. Marche was very friendly and attentive even though she was ALL ALONE! This was about 9:30pm on a Saturday night. She moved around the bar with ease making sure to speak with each customer. A waitress came to her as some guests in the dining area were getting antsy waiting for their drinks. I then realized she wasn't making drinks for only the bar area (including food orders for those of us sitting at the bar) but she was making drinks for the entire restaurant.  Through it all she kept a smile on her face and even managed to make some small talk with me about my son, as she made 3 drinks at once.

You can never go wrong with that; its cheesy, hot, creamy, has chicken, and it has texture because it has crispy tortilla strips For my main course i tried the 6oz classic sirloin with grilled avocados. Its on the lighter choices, i ordered my steak medium rare. It was great! I loved the cherry tomatos mixed and roasted with garlic, and the salad fresca wasnt too shabby. I wished they didnt have the salad pre tossed, but its ok because it was light. The avocados were not roasted, BUT thats ok because i love my avocados prepared any way! To top it off, i had to try their southern style mac n cheese. It was a side and the portion and price was great 1.00$ and it was ultra cheesy!! Definitely love this place!

I looked inside and everyone seated just stared. I was the only minority in the room and I hate playing the race card, but I was definitely discriminated against. The server saw me at the door waiting for 10 minutes. She did not want to help me get seated nor make sure someone came to the front to assist. I waited another 5 minutes before looking frustrated. I rang the bell twice. Nothing. I would never come back to a restaurant that poorly managed! I thought living in Southern California, where there is a diversity of ethnic groups, we would be treated as equals.

Art S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",108,73,10,1.0,10/6/2014,"Based on this visit alone, it is conclusive to say, that I will not be returning to this Chilis establishment ever again. I was not surprised to find so many negative reviews already posted here, says a lot about the owner or manager of this restaurant when it comes to keeping customers happy.  Came here shortly after happy hour started and we were told that only the bar area qualified for happy hour but not the other side of the restaurant. Okay, that fine. There were two server in that area serving, as one continuously passed by ignoring us not even asking if we wanted to something to drink or to look at the menus. Our table was cleaned down and the server never even acknowledged us, as if we put her in this miserable position to clean our table. It really bothered me so much because she was serving the people right next to us but at the time making us feel like complete ghosts. I could draw a lot of theories, including race, but I will hold that thought. It was not until 10 min later until another server presented herself and asked what we would like.  We had regrettfully had the chicken nachos, and the two for $20 fajitas and chicken pasta entrees. What can I say....I couldnt tell what was worst, the food or the customer service but both were awful. We didnt even finish the food because it was soooo greasy, like really greasy. We couldn't take another bite, it was just like ordering a  heart attack. It took forever to also get a refill on water, I was waiting to wash the greasiness down. Needless to say, we hardly ate anything, paid and left. I wish I could of taken a picture of the filth that was served, it was not well prepared.

You know the icky clear look that uncooked shrimp has... well yeah, that's what they were served even AFTER they had to wait an additional five minutes longer than the rest of the table for their meals.   The shrimp fajita platter came out barely warm without any sizzle to the dish that is so familiar when one orders fajitas... When this was brought to the waitresses attention she said ""Oh, you want some of that?"" then brought out a little plastic cup of cold brown liquid to pour over the already cold uncooked shrimp!  The shrimp tacos were equally as horrid being stuffed with raw shellfish.   These dishes were ordered by vegetarians who couldn't share the other meals at the table, so needless to say, 1/3 of our party left this establishment hungry... that sucked big time, who wants to go to dinner and leave hungry?

Food is always cold due to the lack of proper staff and kitchen management. They should terminate everyone and start fresh with real staff that can actually handle the out put of food and being able to make sure 1 tables food is ready at the same time so no one gets cold food.

We arrived around 8PM, and were seated pretty immediately.  Our waitress was very pleasant, but super slow and difficult to find throughout our meal.  We ordered off the 2 for $20 menu (which includes one of the pre-selected appetizers and two entrees) and got: Tostada Chips & Corn Roasted Guacamole Chicken Fajitas Cajun Chicken Pasta The chips and guacamole came out relatively quickly.  The chips were incredibly thin, which caused them to break really easily when trying to scoop the guacamole.  The appetizer came with some salsa when mixed with the guacamole actually tasted pretty yummy.  There wasn't anything special about the guacamole, it was okay. The Cajun Chicken Pasta was not as cajun-y as I thought it was going to be.  I expected some spice and kick to the pasta, but instead it simply tasted like an alfredo sauce.  There was a piece of garlic bread on top of the pasta that was greasy and not-so-flavorful as half of the bread was burnt.  My friend seemed to enjoy her fajitas. Unfortunately, nothing about this location stood out to me.  The food was average and the service was decent.  I was definitely underwhelmed by my experience, and can't say that I have any desire to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=180

My mom ordered chicken enchiladas and they literally put a small amount of chicken. You probably can count how many shredded chicken were in there. Tortillas were hard.

Jasper L.,"Arcadia, CA",873,60,37,1.0,4/26/2013,"Went to this Chili's with a coworker for Happy Hour around 6:30. It was very packed but we managed to get seated at the bar. We ordered two margaritas and three appetizers. The only positive thing I have to say about this Chili's is the drinks. The Bartender was really trying hard: he was the only one at the entire bar with about 20 some people waiting on him. Unfortunately the rest of it was a disaster. The worst thing about this Chili's is the hygiene. I have no idea how they pass food inspection. While we were sitting at the bar, we noticed that the bartender would grab a used glass, dunk it into a soapy sink, then into the next one with less soap, and finally into one with little soap. He then poured water into that glass and served - with bubbles still on it. Both of us were in disbelief because there's no way that the guy didn't even wipe the glass. But it happened over and over again. What drew the line for us, was when we saw the server drop some fries on the counter next to the dishwash zone, and proceded to put it back onto the plate. It was clearly obvious that some dishwashing soap had gotten on there and both of us stopped eating. Please save yourself some stomach (and heart) ache by avoiding this place at all cost. My goodness this place is disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=220
Jonnathan D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,10/16/2016,"This review is more so directed towards the SERVICE. SPECIFICALLY on Sunday evening around 930ish. First of all, we were waiting for quite a while for a table to open up for 5. We were the only  people in the lobby area. No friendly greeting or ""we apologize for the wait""...finally seated, we literally waited for 15 minutes and no server to offer us drinks. I had to flag down someone from another section (she was very helpful)...great..until we were waited from our official server. In which he asked if we were ready to order, with his reply in a rude manner ""let's go then""...WOW REALLY...not a pleasant or comfortable experience  for the remainder of the evening. Call it ""bad timing"" if u will. However, it's unfortunate that one staff member messed the whole thing up. ***UPDATE IN REAL TIME***...our waiter messed up our order...(that's what happens when u don't write down orders)...you go to a hole in the wall spot where the food is awesome, you'd expect maybe a little ""sucky"" service. But from a national food chain where a huge amount of time and resources are spent training staff....they should change the name of this location to ""silly's"" ...

I noticed that the sport bar area had  a few booths missing and placed a table and chairs in their place. Not only did it look out of place as it was done most haphazardly, it reduces actual seating capacity; my guess is another 8 - 10 patrons are missing space seating space with these tables vs booths. Tables are smaller and only hold 4, while booths tables are longer and can hold 4,5, or 6 depending on if its  a grorup of young skinny teen girls or a family with a baby or couple of kids.

He dropped our drinks off, took our order, brought our appetizer and soups, but then hasn't been around after that. There was another server or runner who dropped off our food. He did not check on our table to see how everything was, we needed refills on our drinks, napkins, and my son's Mac n Chez was dry and stuck together I had to send it back and order something else. My Santa Fe Chix Salad was a small plain salad with tortilla chips and spicy dressing added, not appealing at all. Also the quality of the food had gone down as well. Our server checked back at our table about 10 mins. later...smh. He was nice about everything but needed to keep up with his tables. I do appreciate the birthday song for my niece. Thank you.

Finally after we got our food which was almost an hour later, we didn't see her until we had to remind her about the birthday song for our niece. It's like our waitress DGAF.

If gratuity wasn't included, trust me she would not have gotten one.  We spent over two hours at dinner mainly due to slow service.

Kevin P.,"Long Beach, CA",23,45,97,2.0,9/20/2012,"Upon entering the Carson, CA location, I saw many empty tables and thought ""great, we will be seated right away"" yet was told it would be a 5-10 minute wait. I asked why since there were tables available and was told they needed to be bussed. The hostess stated they only had three servers for the entire restaurant. Having restaurant management experience myself, I knew this was a good indicator that the restaurant is mismanaged and the hostess agreed.   Once seated, Charles noticed we hadn't been waited on and was quick to respond. He quickly apologized for the wait and asked to take our order. We ordered everything at once for fear we would have to wait extra long between our drink order, appetizer and entrees but Charles proved us wrong and delivered our drinks and food quickly (perhaps because he saw I was drafting this review?).   Our appetizer (Tostada Chips & Fire-Grilled Corn Guacamole) came with greasy and overcooked chips. Our dinners (Margarita Grilled Chicken) were only warm and we thought about sending them back to be microwaved but again, we feared it would take too long so we ate them anyway.   The food was good and it was clear Charles and the rest of the crew were making a good effort to take care of as many customers as they could while serving the food in a timely manner. Since I witnessed the wait staff and food runners diligently working to provide the best service possible, I can only surmise the problem lies with the poor management running this particular location.   The hostess could have been better trained to open the door for arriving customers as many of Chili's competitors do, take the customer's drink order if the wait staff is busy and maybe even assist with bussing the tables. None of the workers had smiles on their faces and they all seemed to be very stressed. At no point in the evening did I see any signs of a manager.

Ricardo M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",7,55,,1.0,4/11/2013,"First time I have been to this Chili's location...not impressed.  Generally, I don't like Chili's but my girlfriend loves their burgers.  So since relationships are all about compromise, off to Chili's we went. Seating - First off, we were quoted a wait time of 15 to 20 minutes.  The place was pretty packed so that was fine.  Luckily, or maybe not so luckily, a table opened in the bar area so we took that instead of waiting. Patrons - Please note that since Carson is Compton adjacent, you will have a much rowdier crowd that is borderline or has crossed the line into ratchet territory.  It appears that the staff meets the same criteria as the people who frequent this Chili's location. So expect a lot of hooting and hollering during your dining experience. Staff - When taking the aforementioned table in the bar area, I asked the waitress working the area if the table was open.  Sensed a bit of an attitude but whatever, I kind of expected it. She then proceeds to clean the table with a towel by wiping all the crumbs and leftover remnants onto the floor and seats.  Nice to know they keep the place in such tip top shape! Food -  Ordered the 2 for $20 deal.  Appetizers were cheese sticks which came out cold.  It was like eating a stick of string cheese coated in batter.  Usually cheese sticks come out a little gooey when they are done being fried.   Ordered the bacon cheese burger as the entrée.  Took a few bites and noticed that the burger was on a wheat bun.  It didn't bother me much but my girlfriend was kinda irked about it.  We asked the waitress what was up and she went to the back. Apparently, they had been out of regular hamburger buns for a few days...seems to me that this place is a little mismanaged.  The least our server could have done was notify us...but she said she hadn't noticed a difference when serving the food for the last few days?

I'm not judging her as a person because that's just rude and and I don't know the girl. She did the usual routine...introduction..appetizers?..drinks..? We ordered and got our drinks. I ordered a margarita, which she just shook but didn't pour into my glass. They always pour it in the glass. Sad. I really would let little things like this go but then more bullsh*t started.  3. our food. Took 30 minutes for our food. Remember what I said ""It wasn't busy"". I ordered the Crispy something something Chicken. There was 3 different ""crispy somethings"". My entree didn't taste so ""crispy"". It tasted as if it was sitting under the heating lamp for 30 MINUTES.  4. none of the usual follow-up. Our server didn't even ask if everything was okay. Also, no refills. We had to ask for one. There was a couple right across from us. All she had to do was turn around and ask one or two questions that would've taken less than 2 minutes. Once we finally got her attention. I had to give her step by step instructions. For example: We want this dessert, a box for the ""crispy"" dinner, a check, and by the way A REFILL.  5. dessert. Can you believe this..I'm complaining about dessert! Have you ever been asked if we wanted dessert to go? Well, that Saturday night was our first time. It wasn't our server who asked it was a girl who wore a bright pink bandana (wait am I at Chili's?). When we were asked that question, we felt as if it meant ""get the f*ck out"". When we replied with no. She should have thought ""there goes the tip"". I'm a good tipper.  6. other diners. While waiting for our food, I noticed that all the other diners were looking around for the server. Seriously, I even saw someone stand up like ""hello, where are  you?"". Our server, stopped acknowledging us after she took our order. I've been to this Chili's more than 10 times. This is a disappointment. I live 3 minutes away from this place but now I'll waste gas and go to Torrance or Long Beach. Thank you Chili's in CARSON for representing our city. 7. the check. We were handed the check and it was odd because she was didn't even give us time to put down the money. Our server came back in less than ten seconds for the check. Wait, she pays more attention to the check than the diners. Let's recap. We were asked if we wanted dessert to go then we were rushed to pay for the check. How do you think I'll feel and how much do you think I'll tip? Overall, Chili's seems to be getting bad. I've had better service here but maybe since we're in a recession they cut back on orientation/training hours. If I was allowed to not give this place any stars I would have. Since I have to...One star for being in Carson and the margarita. To the Bartender working on July 17, Saturday night at 8pm, Thanks for making my drink strong. I think you knew the service was going to be horrible and you found a way to relax me. I'm not being sarcastic but you really made a great drink. I would've made an effort to tip you instead of our server but I wanted to get out of there before I started complaining out loud. I know it's a chain restaurant but I expect decent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=240

Johnny G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",694,264,2801,2.0,5/2/2011,"Went in for lunch recently. Did not want anything to heavy (tough prospect at a Chili's) and decided on a salad. I have had the Buiffalo Chicken Ranch  before, and it was really good (but again, heavy). Thought I would try the Caribbean. Mistake. Maybe I caught someone on a bad day? I thought it kind of sucked. Bland, forgettable, and ultimately unsatisfying. Lettuce did not seem fresh. How can it be listed as a favorite on the menu? If this is what it is served like regularly, I just don't get it. Chicken was totally dried out. The portion size was  overall very disappointing for 10 bucks. There was NO love involved in the creation of this bogus representation of a healthy alternative. I know that the burgers, especially the  JALAPEÑO SMOKEHOUSE BACON BURGER is the bomb (Had it elsewhere) so I am not out to knock anyone intentionally.  It's just if this is there idea of a fresh salad, I really need to lower my expectations, or simply avoid them at Chili's altogether. Maybe it was my bad, looking for something healthy. Like I said their burgers are bad-ass, I know that. Anyway, first time last time, thumbs down on the Caribbean salad. Service was actually OK. Not stellar, and not really bad.

My burger was definitely a frozen puck that was over cooked.  The cheese was over melted probably because it was a small piece of some synthetic product. The fries were just ok, but a small serving.  I had to ask for mustard as it is not on the table. My friend had a triple play (or whatever) appetizer.  He said it was dried out and not very satisfying and missing celery that was shown in the menu.  the food is served in plastic tubs.  No water is offered.  For a time this location had little competition in the area, but there are new restaurants on the scene and hopefully more to come.  It seems to me the chain has new owners?  perhaps they are several times removed from the founders?

Good food, good service, yummy drinks that are generous with the good stuff,  and no mistakes on special instructions, just how I like my meals. Try the Taco pizza = fiesta in your mouth! Only downside is actually an upside, the wait can be long because the service and food are good and Carson is hella limited on restaurants.  Favs would include the burgers, tortilla soup (but it taste like enchilada), and the create your own appetizer.

My disappointment in my experience there today is directed at management.  I happened to leave my cell phone on the dining table we ate at.  That is totally my fault, and I take full responsibility for that.  However, my cell phone disappeared after an extremely short time (i.e. walked to my car, realized I didn't have my phone, walked back in).  The table had just been bussed, but no one had seen the phone.  Hmmm.  The manager took my name and number but didn't seem to go to any extra effort to assist in spite of the short time that had elapsed. I also spoke to the women seated near us that were still there, and they said the only people that had been by the table were the servers.   Well, I'll check ebay tonight to see if my phone is there.  In the meantime, I don't recommend this restaurant, or just make sure you don't leave any personal items there for five minutes or more.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=240

The contributing factor for this low review is based on the customer service which is really crappy. My server took 15min to just bring freaking drinks! After that I ordered and it took another 20min to get the appetizer which was salsa and chips. Seriously just plain and simple: salsa and chips!  Then guess what...? The main dish took another 25min  to be served. So you get the idea, by the time I received my main dish I was already full from the soda and chips. To make things even worse my ghetto server just left or finished her shift without saying a word so I waited an waited till I was unfortunate to get another even crappier server.

We ordered chips and salsa, and my goodness.. some of the chips were either too stale, too oily, too salty, or all of the above.  I ordered the chicken fajita meal and low and behold I get more SALT.  My girl ordered the fajita trio and she got the same salty grilled onions.  YUCK!  The grilled onions/peppers were way too salty, but I would have to say everything else was ok, but man chef...easy of the salt!

Waited about 30 minutes to get seated after I was told 10-15 minutes wait then I looked and there were about eight 8 tables. 2. Our waiter was Cesar was AWESOME very courteous and attentive. 3. Order a regular Margarita had to send back thick like slurpe, and very strong not from alcohol but from the syrup. The waiter came back and apologized and said that was a very bad Margarita would you like something else said No thanks, I'll pass. He said he tasted and informed the Manager, and the Bartender.  4. I ordered the Old Timer Burger and asked for mustard asked a waiter that was passing by. When he handled me the bottle and did not realize that it was full of dust (like the dust that builds up on ceiling fans blades) the bottle was dirty like they had not clean it in months, after the dust fell unto my burger I immediately lost my appetite . I asked the waiter to please see the bottle, which he immediately removed and again apologized. I then asked to speak to a manager which took a while to get someone to come to the table. It was a female manager informed about the problem, but did not see and she apologized. As I was talking to the my waiter Dave Mills General Manager came to the table. First time I have ever encounter a GM who the first out of his mouth are "" What seems to be the problem""? No ""i'm sorry to hear there's a problem can you please tell me what happen?'

He seemed to have gotten upset that he had tried it to determine the problem.    It was so bad that the table next to us was so applauded of what they were hearing from this GM, that she gave me her number.

Once waiter decided to show up he noticed the side missing and said be right back. Took more time so just finished what was edible and paid the bill. Waste of time and not even good food. Again wait time is understandable but come on the food wasn't even good. Never stopping by here again even if close to stadium.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=260

I had to ask for silverware 4 times and refills took forever. Its not our waitress fault was great just over worked due the fact they were short staffed.

C.M. V.,"Long Beach, CA",61,25,1,2.0,7/9/2013,"Customer service was very lackluster.  We had to seat ourselves, because the host at the door did not acknowledge or greet us. We ordered two drinks which took more than 15 minutes to receive. Once we received our drinks, there was a bug in mine and there was thick pink lipstick stains on my husband's mug. We alerted the closest employee who was a bus boy, immediately. He didn't apologize. He took the two dirty drinks back to the bartender and our waitress, Jessica.  The bus boy, our waitress, the bartender, and the manager didn't immediately address our issue. Our waitress didn't come back. The bus boy came back a few minutes later with the new drinks, didn't say a thing to us about the drinks, just placed the drinks haphazardly on our table, didn't make eye contact, and didn't apologize. A few minutes after that, our waitress finally returned to our table with the food we ordered. Jessica, our waitress BARELY apologized about the dirty drinks that were served to us earlier and BARELY checked on us throughout our stay. It's been standard to get a visit from a manager when service and food fall below acceptable, but the manager never was alerted to the problem. Overall, it seemed to be an establishment culture to just sweep issues under the rug like they never happened. We are very disappointed in this establishment's management and employees. Been to this location previously, and didn't experience any problems with service or food/drinks. It's unfortunate that this Chili's falls below expectations of what a Chili's chain restaurant claims to be, because we're in the area frequently and would have considered patronizing this restaurant consistently. At this point, we certainly wouldn't consider coming here anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=280

The place was pretty empty, and in our group is was about 7 of us, so I'm confused as to why it took the servers about 10 minutes to come and greet us and give us the menus. Anyways, I guess there were so many servers on the floor that they didn't know who should come to us.  The girl who ended up being our server was really nice and got our orders a-okay. I was kind of skeptical because she didn't even write down what the entire table of seven needed and memorized it all. I was waiting for her to screw up, but nope, she was on key. I ordered a bacon burger and a mai tai, but honestly didn't enjoy the mai tai that much. It didn't taste sweet at all as I've had at other places, so it was just okay. Not that bad.

Henry Y.,"Carson, CA",99,141,60,1.0,1/24/2013,"OOOOOKKKKKKKK HERE WE GOOOOOO SOOOO. Let me start with something positive....................... ""I love the name Chili's"" (there now this review is officially fair. lol I walked into chili's one day for take out and they took almost 10 minutes for someone to come out and take my order. It was lunch time on a weekday, the place wasn't packed, and about 3 employee's walked right by me and didn't say anything. IF  IT'S NOT YOUR WORK STATION TELL WHOEVER'S WORK STATION IT IS, AND TELL THE GUEST THEY WILL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.  After my order was taken I sat and watched an older gentlemen struggle to find someone to help him find someone to take his order. It made me so sad to see, but eventually he found someone. Also while I was sitting there waiting on my order, the phones were going off that no one was answering. It was the phone to take orders right next to the register at the to go counter. 01/17/13 The second time I went was about 9pm-10pm on a Thursday night. The infamous ""If you would like to make a togo order please see the bartender"" sign was up. I went to the bartender who looked to be busy and asked for help, she said one minute please I said ok. I was watching the Laker game that was on the screen for about 5 minutes and she came back to me. When she came back to me it was with the worst ""hurry up and order""  attitude I've ever seen in the history of food service in my life. She was soooooo rude and I haven't even said 3 words to her yet. She said ""so what did you want"" with this hurry up and order face continuously nodding to get me to finish, just completely rushing me. (keep in mind, I already new what I wanted, I get the same thing every time. Baby back ribs full rack with original bbq sauce, side of loaded mash, and apples ""easy right?"" so why was she rushing me???? That order doesn't even take 20 sec to say.) She comes back and ask if that's it once again giving me attitude. YOU WOULD'VE THOUGHT I HIT  HER CAR ON THE WAY IN AND NOW SHE HAD TO SERVE ME OR SOMETHING. Before she finished putting the order in I realized I wanted a black berry lemonade. I'm a bit irritated at this point by her attitude but I'm thinking to myself she's over worked maybe (making excuses for her in my head). I politely said excuse me and she didn't hear me (maybe) so I asked the gentleman facing her to get her attention for me. As she turns around I said actually ma'am I would like a black berry lemonade. She then rolls her eye's takes a deep breath and exhales pretty loud. I generally don't walk out but TODAY WAS THAT DAY!!!!!! My company brings employee's here all the time for a sit down and eat company business meeting. All and all the customer service in this place has a feel of "" we don't need your money"". From the not answering the phones, to the long wait times to order the to go orders, to the employee's. Most companies have a Good, Better, and Best structure. Carl's Jr for example Best: $6 Burger meal large size. Better: Regular meal large size. Good: individual items (i.e. a single burger, 99 cent chicken sandwich) pretty much something for EVERYONE saying : we don't care if your rich, or a bum on the street,  WE WANT WHATEVER MONEY YOU HAVE, PENNY'S NICKLES DIMES WHATEVER!!!! JUST SPEND IT HERE!!! They lose money daily, DAILY!!! for stupid reasons for the reasons listed above (not answering phones, long wait times to order, and customer service). This chili's has lost my business, I will no longer refer or bring my employee's here. It's sad that a city such as Carson so close to Compton (90746 area) easily adopts a negative connotation, and when a person has to decide whether to go to the chili""s in Torrance or the one in Carson they will make the further drive to go to one that reflects a more upscale community for better customer service. I hope the employee's read this and now understand the low amount of hours they are possibly getting. Henry Ford (the founder of the Ford Motor Company, and sponsor of the development of the assembly line technique of mass production) eliminated a note worthy amount of people in the work force, replacing them with machines. In an economy where it's already rough to find a job, we still see this today. AMC theaters automated ticket buying service which eliminates the people at the window, vending machines in general. I guess to get the desired service I'll just have to go to Chili's online to order, walk in pay and leave don't need a full staff to ring me up after all. After all it would be nice to see that bartender replaced with an App on my cell phone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=280

Looked like they poured some cream sauce in a bowl and served it with some chips. We were starving so we are the chips with salsa.  We proceeded to order, I ordered the prime rib Tex-Mex bowl, which should've had grilled prime rib and grilled peppers and onions.  When I received the bowl, again it looked nothing like the picture on the menu. It looked like boiled meat and Raw bell peppers and raw onions, with burnt tortilla Chips under some brown avocado! I asked the waitress to take it back because it was nothing like the picture in the menu and honestly, looked disgusting!  I shared my sons dish because it had taken so long for the meal!

Food was okay.  Pretty much it's chilli's, so no matter what Chili's your at, food should be the least of your worries. The service by far is what kills this place.  Walked in on a Sunday at around 9pm, still with two hour of business time left.  They quoted us for a 30 minute wait but seemed like it was only ten.   Was seated and the waitress that seated us, left the menu and drink menu.  3 minutes pass and then another waitress came and asked us if we were ready to order. Of course we weren't.  We explained that two more people were coming and was told that their order had to be placed by ten. We seemed to be a bit rushed so picked out a few items.   Took around 20 minutes until out waitress came to take our order.  Took 20 minutes until our food came.   So by now we have 15 minutes until the kitchen closes and we are just getting our food.  So much for desert. 5 minutes pass and boom!!  There is our check!  Understanding that there is an hour until closing time.  We got our money and paid while most of us still had about half of our food left.  We figured we would be left alone to enjoy our food and get the drink refills as need but this was expecting too much. 10 on the dot happens and this place become a mad house for closing time.  Keep in mind it is only 10pm maybe a few minutes after.  I am currently still eating at this time.  We asked a different waitress for bags and boxes for our food.  Comes back with bags and boxes, but negates to pick up our empty plates.

They never even gave me a chance to walk out because they collected my money as soon as I walked in and never said how long it was going to be; they just kept saying 10 more minutes every time I asked how much longer it would take.

When it comes to service, it's really the luck of the draw.  Either you get waiters with decent attitudes, or you get our gem of a waitress today, who basically had a perpetual scowl.  Look lady, if we were being unreasonable with something, then I'd understand the face.  But seriously, having just a bad attitude the entire time?  What customer wants to deal with that? By the way, the appetizers are supposed to come slightly before the main dish, not at the same time. Usually the food is pretty decent, if you go for the Chicken Crispers, the burgers, or the fajitas, etc.  They have this ""$9.99 Fresh Pairings""... yeah... DO NOT GET THE BBQ PULLED PORK sandwich.  It looked more pathetic than a $0.99 cent burger from your local fast food restaurant.  The sandwich was about the same size and shape as an Arby's Arby-Q, but was just absolutely disgusting.  Wife ordered that during lunch, and commented that she wouldn't feed that sandwich to the dog. This is the only Chili's we know of that no longer serves Broccoli Cheese soup.  The one in Lakewood is a bit better, has better food, and is serving up fewer scowls.  Yeah, I don't plan on coming back here ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=300

Rain F.,"Reno, NV",247,711,906,1.0,11/14/2009,"6:30pm : We got in and had our name placed listed on the waiting list. Apparently, there was a 30 to 35 minutes wait. Because we drove all the way from downtown LA to here and the nearest Chili's we could think of had valet/paid parking, we just decided to stay. 6:50pm : I went to the bar are to get a strawberry margarita. The super friendly bartender *insert sarcasm here* kept ignoring me then eventually asked me for my ID so I brought it out quickly but he was quicker to turn away and serve another guest. So I just waited and waited until he got back to me. That was after he served three glasses of beer and grabbed some more beers from the back of the kitchen. I was getting annoyed at this point but I wanted my margarita so I really had no choice but wait when I probably should just have left because I definitely can make a better margarita than that.  Around 7, we were finally seated and ready to order. We had to wait a few minutes for our server because he was all over the place. He eventually took our order but never wrote it down. After giving us our appetizer, he informed us that he ""lost"" our paper and asked us for our order again. My friend and I were doubting if he'd get it right so we agreed to send it back immediately if he didn't. We thought the Texas cheese fries without Jalapenos were pretty good. Basically, it was fries topped with melted cheese and bacon bits on a small pan.  The entrees eventually came. The verdict, TOO SALTY! To his credit, the server did get our order exactly like we wanted.  We ordered the sweet shots for dessert. So I thought we could not go wrong with these since I already tried them last night... I could not be more wrong! There was about a two inch piece of white plastic inside one of the shot glasses. We told our waiter about it and he looked at us confused and asked if we wanted it replaced. We told him no since we were pretty full already. He just took the shots away and left. The manager approached us just as we were ready to leave and told us that she was notified of the situation. She offered to replace the dessert and we declined again. She ended up discounting our bill by not charging us for dessert. Not coming back anytime soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=300

Providing excellent customer service isn't something you can do once in a while - and Symone satisfies the need by doing this consistently. Meeting and exceeding customer expectations is her top-of-mind at all times. If the quality of your service is inconsistent, your customers will not be pleased, as I have experienced before but NEVER with this young lady in particular! Chili's as a whole (Management) needs to realize that once the bar has been set, lowering it will disappoint customers, and disappointing customers means losing revenue. Symone I hope that this company is treating you like the royalty that you are.

Nicole U.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",192,685,219,1.0,4/19/2015,"UH, No thank you.  Wow this was a pretty awful experience. Where do I even start? We put in an order for traditional bone in buffalo wings, the server even clarified that we wanted bone in wings. 20 minuts later, no wings....the server stopped by and realized they hadn't arrive and promised they would be out shortly (thinking she forgot to put in the order). Shortly turned into another 15 minutes and then they brought us the wrong wings, breaded and nugget like. So they sent those back and eventually we ended up with an order of wings. They were average, and served with below average blue cheese dressing. We tried to order drinks, each asking for a shot plus an actual beverage. Nothing arrived. Finally the server came over and said she could not serve us more than one drink at a time...ok that is understandable, but why haven't we gotten one of our drinks yet? Finally the shots arrive, well poured so thank you for that....and eventually our beverages arrived.  Server went home, so the new lady helping us seemed quite nice and more on top of things. We both ordered rib eyes medium rare with extra broccoli and garlic butter...food arrived and while they got the order right, the steaks were awful. One rib eye was mooing at us (perfect thanks) the other was gray and cooked all the way through (uh this is not medium rare). I hate sending food back so I tried to power through my gray steak. It was awful, super tough and my jaw ached from trying to chew it. I ended up tapping out, was offered a box to take it home and declined....I wanted to get as far away from that shoe leather as possible. We paid over $130 for food and drinks and all we got was crappy service, chewy steaks and extreme upset stomachs later that night.

Danielle L.,"Long Beach, CA",32,34,1,1.0,8/16/2016,"My family and I patronized this restaurant on Sunday after church. We were lucky to find a table in the bar . We sat there for about 10mins before we stopped someone to get us drinks. Not one server came by to welcome us . So we order drinks and they come without straws. The server comes back with the straws and I find a floatie in my club soda. I ask for another. That takes another 10mins. In the meantime we decided what we were gonna order. We ask the gentleman if he was our server, because he never identified himself as such. We just thought we stopped a random server walking by, because that was how the interaction felt. He tells us he's our server. So we begin to order.  We have food allergies at our table. So I'm a little nervous because he's not writing anything down. I figured maybe he has done this before and continue ordering. I order a house salad, no onion. I look the server in the face and tell him that my husband has an onion allergy. To prevent any onion even being around him, I ordered my salad this way. I also reiterated this to the server. I ordered my main which was the Chicken Fajitas. Knowing that these are traditionally made with onion. I again ask for the onion to be omitted from my plate. Again reiterating that there is an allergy to onion at the table. Sizzling onions at the table would bother him. He says ok.  So the salads come out perfect,mine with no onion. At this time our drinks are beginning to empty. I start to look around and see our server sitting in a chair in the ""to go"" area. He's taking a break in the middle of our service while we all sit there thirsty. He finally decides to come by the table. We ask for refills, which didn't hit the table until after I asked the manager Patrick for one when our experience went sour. We will get there eventually.  So the food starts to come out. Here comes mine, Chicken fajitas with onion everywhere. Steaming onion aroma fills the air as they sizzle on the grill. I immediately look and say this is not supposed to have onion. Our server doesn't respond and just takes the plate away nonchalantly. I begin to get upset because I specifically asked this guy not to put onion on my plate. I even explained why I needed it not to be on there. I look over at my husband as his eyes get red and he start hacking. He starts to cough really aggressively. I ask if he's ok. I keeps coughing for about 4mins. I then look and he's turning red. I force him to go outside and get some fresh air. By this time the server comes back over and brings my friends food. Once again he nonchalantly shrugs off my husbands allergy. Who is now outside sitting on a bench catching his breath. My friend asks the server if he is remorseful, because he wasn't even apologetic. That's when we asked for a manager. Mind you only half of our table has food. Patrick, the manager, comes over and I begin to explain to him how upset I was by what happened. I explained to him that I have been in the service industry for 10yrs and I still write down orders. I work for Mortons The Steakhouse, as a server. Now I don't expect to receive the same level of service at Chili's that I give at Mortons. However, I do expect to not be served something I said I specifically didn't want. Patrick brings out our food. He also gets us refills. Which hadn't had happened until that point. He also informs me that my husbands food hadn't come out because it made incorrectly as well. Patrick told us that, we would have a new server Andre. He also told us he had taken 25% off of our bill. We finally all had our food. My friends were done, but at least we were eating. Our drinks were low again, as we were drinking with our meals. We were looking for a refill. However, it would be another 20mins before a server even acknowledged our presence. So we asked a server, some girl not Andre,for our bill. I still til this day. Have no idea who Andre is or what he looks like. So we wait, and wait. She comes back about 10mins later. She tells us there had been a computer issue and she would do her best to get our check.........Still no Andre. So we are beyond irritated at this point and my friend approaches the ""to go"" counter where Patrick is standing. She asks him for our check. He says there's a computer failure and there's nothing he can do. We tell him we just want to pay. Patrick then informs us that we can pay on Ziosk machine. That information would have been nice 20mins before. We pay our bill and Patrick can see that I'm upset. He send a lady manager over to ask about our experience. I told her the story and said I would never be back. They gave me some Chili Bucks and I still will never go to Carson Chili's again. After the food mess up, the service was still horrible. No one ever came by. The level of carelessness was disgusting. Though they attempted to make me happy it was too late. Food allergies are something serious. This location doesn't take them serious enough for me and my family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=100

Unfortunately on this day I was incredibly disappointed about the service. Walked in was immediately told wait was about ten minutes didn't get seated till thirty minutes later various tables were open. Seemed a bit weird. We we're finally seated we didn't get any kind of service till 20 min after we were seated. We order two appetizers and our meals. Our entrees arrived before our appetizers. Not to mention no kind of accommodations were made about this. They didn't even inform us that they didn't have chips till the food was already coming out. We were informed the chips would be ready and a couple of minutes so we said that was fine we understand. We waited some more no sign of the chips. She then offered to change our order so we opted to change the order because it would be faster according to her. The chicken was undercooked not even crispy almost soggy. People who were seated after us who had ordered the same appetizers were served before us. Which was odd since we had been there for forty minutes already just waiting. We did notice that they were not busy which added to our confusion on why our service was not what it has been before. The girl who served us seemed really nice and polite to other customers but did not seem that way when she would approach our table.

We went in on a Tuesday around 4pm and sat at the bar. There was only another couple at the bar who had ordered take out and another couple sitting in a booth, when my girlfriend and I walked in along with a separate couple. They chose a booth and we went to the bar top. First of all, wash your hands before you eat after you touch a menu there! Disgusting!! Second, check all of your silverware! Of my two forks that were lying atop each other, one was pasted with something brown and came out of a napkin that was rolled by an employee! After ten minutes of waiting, Stephanie finally came out from somewhere and threw a coaster in front if us and barely offered us a drink. I know that chilis offers happy hour but there was no menu, and after we ordered a full price appetizer, I asked her if they had happy hour and she rolled her eyes at me and went searching for one, which was also filthy dirty! She walked off and for the next 15 minutes while we waited for our appetizer trio(that was served cold), I took the liberty of watching what was going on. My girlfriend is server at a fine dining restaurant and my expectation of chilis is never going to be high but there is a standard! Where we were sitting was right near the entrance of the kitchen and not one female there wears their hair back in at least a pony tail, and I know for a fact that they all serve and handle food because I've worked in a newer chain as well. Team service is supposed to help things along but there is no management at this chilis to ensure that's happening. In the 15 minutes we waited, the couple that was there when we arrived was mad at the slow service and wanted to cancel their order, and another couple that had walked in was asking if they could get some service. The manager was finally dealing with the people who were canceling but disappeared and wasn't seen again. All the while Stephanie spent the entire time running her hands through her unkempt hair and talked to another couple that came to the bar after us. She never asked us if our food was ok, which it wasn't and it was clear she didn't want us to order more. Too bad because I'm a great tipper and if she hadn't let me leave hungry she probably would have gotten the best tip she'd ever gotten! This chilis is the worst! We should have never gone back after the time we waited an hour for our food and after we complained and were told we'd be reimbursed and instead were charged twice! That phone call was a nightmare!

Once we sat down she told us a server would be with us (said one name) then right after corrected herself and said a different server would be with us (a female name). Instead a male server came to our table and told us happy hour was only at the bar area but said he would double check if we could order happy hour items from the booth which btw didn't make sense at all because there was an iPad on the table with the happy hour menu on there. He then warned us he needed to see our ID's first and had a really rude tone. The entire time we were there he was a douche. Checked on us once then disappeared the rest of the night but it was cool cause we didn't want his bad attitude around us anyways. He didn't deserve a tip at all but we left one out of pity. Overall, horrible service. Even if you hate your job at least try to make the best out of it or quit. Wouldn't come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=320
Jyenny B.,"Gardena, CA",109,192,28,3.0,5/14/2009,"I shudder at the prospect of being forced to eat at Chili's and will usually only end up at one if it's in an airport and the other choices are worse.  But thanks to the lack of dining choices around CSU Dominguez Hills I ended up here with a classmate to celebrate our freedom from this semester's class. We were there around 6pm on a Monday night, seated in the bar area.  It got busy but not too crowded.  Service was efficient although not overly friendly.  The bartender had some hang up about the menus being placed back into the holder which she commented about and gave me the evil eye every now and then until I gave up on deciding what else to order and just put the damn menu away. The pleasant surprise was finding out that I like their hot wings :)  And at happy hour prices, I might have to stop by Chili's a little more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=320

The steak I ordered was medium rare, and as I sliced it...it turned out so rare that I have to ask the server to take it back and re-cooked it for me.  They pretty much obliged, but gave me a different slice afterwards (because I already sliced a part of it), it looks like it was taken from another piece of meat! The slice was very different from what I did before. They should've given me a new steak, instead of using the one that I turned down. *eek* I liked the loaded mashed potato, and the wherever-it-came-from-steak...just not the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=320

Andrew B.,"Walnut, CA",61,17,3,1.0,6/26/2013,"Very disappointed. I've gone to numerous Chili's, and used to work for the company. I was embarrassed for this place. I should have know better when I saw that it has an AVERAGE of 2 stars. The bathroom was a mess (broken soap dispensers, towels on the floor, baby changing station looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days). Our server came to the table and had a dirty uniform (this was around 1pm, 3 hours after they opened). She forgot my girlfriend's coffee and brought it after we reminded her and already finished our food. She wasn't very welcoming or attentive. The ""fresh corn guacamole"" (that's supposed to be made ""fresh"" everyday) was brown. The manager didn't even know it was suppose to be made fresh everyday and tossed after 12 hours. We were given plates that were dirty and had huge chunks that were broken off. My girlfriend's sandwich was not made right and looked terrible. Her son's chicken breast looked like it had been sitting for 30 minutes before it was brought out. My food was decent. The manager didn't even know the name of my girlfriend's sandwich when she comped it. When she came to the table to apologize, she also was dirty and didn't look professional. Her and our server were nice. There's no excuse for how dirty that restaurant was. I am a manager at a restaurant, and can tell you that the reason this place has 2 stars is poor management. The food quality is poor, cleanliness and sanitation are poor, the service at best was below average. I can't even imagine what the kitchen or back of house look like, when they were ok with how the front of house looked. The only difference between this Chili's and one with 4 or 5 stars, is the management and staff (same recipes, same standards, same training).

We were waiting for them to be brought out they never did. The food was coming out now.  So we asked were the other appetizers were and they went to look and then they brought the other 2 out.  7 people's food come but 4 never did.  We told our waitress and she said oh they should be coming out soon.  So they waited.  It was my bro his wife and his 2 kids food.  We were all done eating there food still had not came so we asked for the manager. The manager came and she went to go see what was goin on. And what do u know.  There food was NEVER entered....what our waitress was doin I don't know! !!! My brother was sooooo pist. His kids were hungry and it wasn't just one persons food missing it was 4!!!

Jim K.,"Long Beach, CA",53,46,8,3.0,10/21/2007,"CILANTRO!!  What is cilantro?  It's sometimes called Flat-Leafed Parsley or Italian Parsley, and is used to add a pungent flavor to Southwestern and Chinese dishes. I'm in a wheelchair, recovering from a stroke, so that's my point-of-view.  This visit was on a Saturday, about 12:30pm. There were four handicapped spaces on the west side of the restaurant, and three were being used.  The fourth one was empty, but was partially blocked by an idling armored car.  We ""gestured"" to the driver that we wanted to use that space.  For a moment, I imagined shots being fired at us from the gunports on the side, but then the armored car driver backed up slowly to let us in.  Whew!!   We were able to park and then I wheeled around to the front, and the hostess held the doors open for me to wheel in (add one star).  There was no waiting for my group of three (add one star) and we were led to a table. The service was a bit slow at first; there was some confusion by the waitstaff as to who was assigned to our table (subtract one star).   We finally ordered our food and drinks.  I had the Triple Dipper, with my selection of Southwestern Eggrolls, Boneless Shanghai Wings, and Boneless Buffalo Wings, conplete with dipping sauces for each one.  One friend had the Chicken Ranch sandwich, but subbed Onion Strands for the french fries. The other friend wanted the Lettuce Wraps, but wanted to be certain that there was no cilantro in the filling, as he has an allergic reaction to cilantro.  The server reviewed the menu description, which read ""Delicious grilled Asian-spiced chicken with carrots, water chestnuts, crispy rice noodles and toasted almonds. Served with fresh Bibb lettuce and sesame-ginger and peanut sauces for dipping.""  She assured my friend that she would make sure that no cilantro was used. When our food arrived, we dug in and started eating.  The eggrolls and the shanghai wings were very tasty (add one star), but the buffalo wings were a bit too spicy.  I couldn't really complain because buffalo wings are supposed to be spicy.  The chicken ranch sandwich arrived with fries, but the server recovered quickly by also bringing out a plateful of onion strands (add one star). The chicken filling for the lettuce wraps had small green leaves that looked like cilantro.  We tasted it for our friend and told him that it was indeed cilantro (subtract one star).  We flagged down the server and she took the plate back to the kitchen.  The manager came out to apologize and explained that although no cilantro is used in the cooking process, it is an ingredient in the company's marinade.  He offered to have the dish prepared with un-marinated chicken (add one star) and my friend agreed to it.  He also offered to execute the chef (add one star), but my friend settled for a complimentary bowl of soup, while waiting for the new dish to come out. The new Lettuce Wraps must have been good, as my friend ate everything on his plate. When we got the check, we thought they would at least comp or discount the Lettuce Wraps for the inconvenience, but no go (subtract one star).  Total rating: three stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=340

Melinda G.,"Orange, CA",1,2,,1.0,11/5/2013,"Group from work came to Chili's to say goodbye to a coworker who was leaving the company.  We had reservations for a group of 15 on a Monday.  The service was HORRIBLE-HORRIBLE!  It took forever to get our drinks, just cokes & water; I didn't think much of it until it took awhile for the 1st meals were brought, then it was every 10-15 minutes for others to get there food, with the last person receiving her food over 30 minutes after the 1st meal was delivered; that last person was me.  The manager came and just kept saying to everyone, I'm sorry she was so insincere and poor management skills.  She told us the waitress was given only our table so she can give us all the attention, but how can 1 person follow 15 orders and deliver drinks and food all at the same time.  There was several waitresses just standing around where they & the manager could of helped this poor waitress!  Really ms. manager?  Never-Never will I go there again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=360
P R.,"Torrance, CA",0,30,,2.0,5/25/2013,"This is the worst Chili's location! I've been here a few times since it is right down the street from my boyfriend's house and sometimes it is easier than to drive to Del Amo. My very first experience there was a year or two ago with a friend. At the end when we paid the waiter asked, ""did you want change back?"" Yeah, I want my change! You don't know if you're getting a tip! And he didn't. I'm a firm believer in tipping well because let's face it, customer service jobs suck, and those people deserve good tips for dealing with people all day, but don't ASSUME you deserve the tip! It was really unprofessional. Anyway, this is the problem with this Chili's: most of their staff sucks! Last week I went with my mom and siblings and we were told the wait was fifteen minutes. It was about twenty five minutes into waiting when the waitress let us know the bar was also open for seating. It would've been nice if she would've told us that twenty-five minutes ago. Of course, I should've assumed so as well since at other Chili's it is always open seating, so no big deal. She had some kind of throat illness, couldn't even say the names loud enough for customers to hear, and so she had to repeatedly say the name of the next party in a scratchy voice. It really made me nervous because she seemed very sick, they should've sent her home or got someone else to host because she's in contact with the menus and so many people. Our waiter took about ten minutes to notice us, but when he did he actually turned out to be one of the best waiters I've had! He memorized our order, repeated it back to us perfectly, had our food out shortly, and gave us extra ranch and dressings without needing to ask. His partner, on the other hand, did not bring me the check when I asked for it. We had to ask our main waiter again! This Chili's is also always packed. Overall the only pleasant experience was my last visit with that great waiter, I forgot his name, but even that experience was only great during the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=360
Joel C.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/31/2013,Last night my family and I had the worst experience at Chili's ever. First of we were given a 30/35 minute wait time. We waited patiently for a bit over an hour before we got seated. As we got seated they already knew we where upset of the wait time and said the manager was aware and was going to try to fix things. Manager never showed up and waitress was taking forever to take our order after she had already given us our drinks which she also got wrong. After that we told the hostess we were leaving and were very disappointed at service and walked out. They showed no concern to try to fix the problem and due to that Chili's has lost a customer. It was my families first time trying Chili's and the only thing they got to try was a zip of their drink (for those that got the right drink) and bad customer service. They will never try to eat at Chili's again. We went to wing stop after that and got better service there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=360
Lisa H.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,22,2.0,7/7/2010,"I am one of those people that actually likes Chili's because it is glorified bar food. However, this place really made me want to leave and had it not been my lunch break I prob would've left. I work locally and we leave for lunch around 11 so PLENTY of time to beat the lunch rush. But for some reason this place wasn't prepared for customers on two separate occasions. At 11:20 there was already a wait (half the restaurant was empty which means they were understaffed) so we sat in the almost empty bar at a booth. It was about 7 minutes before we got up and sat AT the bar because we were being ignored by the waitress who walked past us twice- didn't even greet us to say 'Hi, I'll be with you in a minute'. So now we are at the bar and the bartender takes our order right away, pours our drinks, but then we had to wait about 10 minutes for our soup and salad lunch?! WTH? I saw him back in the kitchen through the bar door standing around with other employees talking when he should've been making our salad or soup. Geesh- I'm am not a snob (I eat at Chili's for crying out loud) but I know bad service when I see it. Will not be back to this place for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carson?start=360
