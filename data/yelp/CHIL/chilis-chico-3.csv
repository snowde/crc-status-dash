Vic M.,"Chico, CA",0,360,620,3.0,8/15/2017,Ssa at the bar and had dinner. Descent service by hard working bartender. Other than the feel that this restaurant is a chain it wasn't terrible. Guacamole burger with fries $10. I paid an extra $1 to get grain feed beef patty instead of cheaper meat which to me is a nice option that Chili offers. The meat was a little too dry which I'm not was due to over cooking or possibly to low fat content. Not a large burger as well as not too bad. Not great either and I won't be ordering it again as it left me feeling that it was mediocre. Food came on a rectangular metal plate with paper placed over the metal.  They had maybe about 8 beers on tap. If you're into wines this is not the place for you as not only their selection is very limited but also they only had one red wine glass and the rest were basic non stemmed glasses.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3
Ronda D.,"Chico, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/7/2017,"Service was great! The Fajitas were very good. I like the boneless chicken wings appetizer. Our waitress kept coming around making sure we had enough drinks, see if we needed anything, etc. I was a bit disappointed when she told me her schedule is based on the reviews from her customers.  Awesome job Jessica!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3
Steven H.,"Paradise, CA",43,13,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Nobody goes to Chili's expecting Gordon Ramsey dining.  With that said everything you order is bathed in a salt bath.   Might as well as just put salt licks on the table and get it over.  My burger was burned, then rest of the food was ok, but sodium was through the roof.   Sorry Chili's lay off the damn salt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3
Anthony F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/5/2018,"Had lunch here yesterday with my wife, the first booth in the bar that we sat at smelled like urine! So we moved, the tables and menus felt as if they had not been cleaned for over a week! Floors and windows dirty! Bar tender was doing everything! So the service was not very good! Food was so bad we didn't finish it and left the rest! Mixed drinks pretty good but was not offered water till we where getting up to leave! The manager was there but wasn't doing anything but standing in the way to the restroom! White sauce on chicken enchiladas tasted like ranch! YUCK!

Paying C.,"Chico, CA",0,3,4,1.0,1/9/2018,I usually get to go food from them but I decided to dine in with some friends and the burger was over cooked and the bun was old and the grilled cheese sandwich was cold and the cheese was cold and solid when I came to the table and the garlic bread I got was burnt on one side so the cook flipped it to the side that wasn't burnt and gave it to me. The waiter made our experience very uncomfortable every time I went to ask him something when he came out he would keep his head straight so I had to raise my hand and wave tiger his attention but I have the feeling he was ignoring me. He was about in his late forties I don't know if that is why he had a poor attitude but he was being very inattentive. I wanted and appetizer after I order and he was a hassle to get him back to my table again and when he brought it out he slide it in the table around a drink really fast and kept walking. I won't be back there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3
Karen A.,"Oroville, CA",8,22,9,1.0,8/4/2017,"Our first time here- we won't be back!! The manager is awesome - she was very attentive- the rest of the staff need replaced! My table was dirty, both of our knives were dirty. I asked about gluten & spy allergies- the waitress handed me a computer to scroll thru- I had a turkey burger wrapped - the lettuce was old and wilted, displayed on a tray with a paper. The meat was so tough and bland, I cut the paper:( my friend had ribs- small portion, plain, not full of flavor- both meals were cold. We yelled out the the waiter who dropped off our food for some ranch and ketchup- he slid ita crossed the table and left quickly.  Nobody asked if our meal was okay- we paid using the computer device and left- lunch took 1 1/2 for fake cold food, non responsive waitress, rude waiter and dirty utensils and table.

And I was kinda shocked by that answer because I order wings with the drumsticks only all the time so I asked her if they can check if they can make it she then proceeds to go in the back and bring out the manager and the manager then acts like I'm a idiot or something saying they can't do drumsticks only and they've never done that before so I told her I was here 2 nights ago and got the same order no problem she then tells me she was here two nights ago and nobody ordered that the managers attitude was so rude and I don't think it's right to call a customer a liar why would I lie about getting drumsticks only I order it all the time but after this instance I will not return and I suggest you don't either if I could give zero stars I would if you like being belittled when trying to order your food then this is the place to go",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3

Cathy P.,"Chico, CA",0,7,,2.0,7/18/2017,No wi-fi available to customers although you know they have it since they offer a trivia game device. Really bad form Chili's! Terrible pour on my first glass of wine but much better on second. Bartender is best thing about this experience. Ordered fried pickles for appetizer which is probably one of the grossest things I've ever seen. See attached photo. Bartender asked how they were and I simply pointed to them. Even though he'd never had fried pickles he could tell they had little or no batter on them. Basically I was served hot pickles! I'm only giving two stars because the bartender was great. All except for calling me ma'am! LOL! Shame on the Chico Chili!'s! One of my fave places in SoCal but this one sucks. My second and last time here. Don't bother peeps.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3

I thought that was really cool.  Im not quite sure what my dish was called but I can say I got the Chicken Enchilada with Chicken Tostada.

MsMichele P.,"Northern California, CA",1266,270,2499,4.0,1/20/2014,"This was the second time I had been to Chili's. The first time was in Inglewood (yup, getting my grub in the hood) and really, the experience was less then desirable. However, on my second trip to Chili's (this time in Chico) the experience was friggin AWESOME! Our server was Alex and this dude was on point with everrrrrrrrything. There was a slight delay on getting our food because the place was packed but he was extra nice, uber attentive and communicated constantly to keep us in the loop about the food delivery time (I can appreciate that. I hate when waiters leave me hangin wondering where my food is man, that pisses me off!). Alex did none of this, he must have been by the table 10 times, smiling and ready to answer our constant questions about the menu and drinks. After our food was delivered and the drinks were flowin the manager (Deanna) stopped by twice to see that we were enjoying ourselves, the food and the drinks... umm, YEAH, BEST COCKTAIL I've EVER had. Honey child, I don't lie when I say this drink is what I believe they serve in Heaven when you arrive.  Mmm Mmmm.... Blackberry Patron Margarita, served in a patron bottle shaker with fresh blackberries floating around inside the shaker. I know your drooling so go ahead and wipe that slobber off your face homie. Yeah, you know you want one. Better hurry yer butt up because they're doing away with this drink soon. WHY DAMMIT you ask?!?!?!!??! I asked the manager and she said its because they are coming out with another signature drink (in my opinion surely wont even compare to this one). BOO!  The only complaint I have is about the salmon. I didn't think to ask until AFTER I ate it but I was told (by the manger) that the salmon is farmed. DISGUSTING. Have your read about farmed salmon?? Read up on it- its SICK man, just NASTY. Otherwise, I would have given Chilis 5 stars... the service was awesome, the drinks were stellar but the fish, doodoo. I'll be back though, I gotta get the recipe to that drink that will soon be gonezo. Its MINE, all MIIIIIIIIIINE!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3?start=40
Michelle L.,"Redding, CA",3,19,,1.0,5/1/2016,This places has one of the worst customer services ever. To start off we waited 7 min in the front since there was no hostess in the front to help us. A line had formed and there was about 4 groups behind us waiting as well. When we finally got our seat we ordered our food and it took us about 40 min before our food came out. We ordered an appetizer and before it came it we told our waitress that we no longer want the appetizer since how long we have been waiting. Within 5 min they brought out the appetizer and then later charged us for it. When we were all done eating (after waiting so long for our food) we asked the manager for a to go box (at that time we were already irritated from the bad service and wait time for our food) we sat there for another 7 min before we realized she forgot about our to go boxes so we asked our waitress instead. We waited about another 5 min while we watched our waitress standing around and talking to a waiter. At that point my boyfriend got up and went up to her and asked her for a to go box. She rolled her eyes and she turned around and walked away. My boyfriend was shocked at how rude she was and unprofessional she was. The guy waiter she was talking to went and got my boyfriend a to go box. I wish I would have gotten the name of the waitress but she is the little lady with the really bad acne scars and acne with a face full of makeup.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3?start=40
Kimbo H.,"Palermo, CA",8,33,110,4.0,12/20/2011,"This was my third visit to this Chilis. I like the food I get here. It's a chain for sure. Even though I am a bit of a foody, I enjoy chains. It's always the same. And they usually find the flavor combos people want. I say ""If you don't like Chilis then F-U! Show me all these people that don't like Chilis!""

Taylor W.,"Concord, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/2/2014,"Our waitress Laurie was so incredibly rude and disrespectful. Everytime we come to chilis we order the two for 20$ and they ALWAYS let us get the queso for the appetizer for an extra 79 cents. Laurie was extremely rude and started flipping through my menu. I then politely asked her to give us a few more minutes due to the fact that our whole plan changed because she refused to honor what we always ordered. We didn't see her again for 25 minutes. She came back and we ordered, then we didn't see her again for another 30 minutes. We didn't get our appetizer until 5 minutes before our main courses arrived and we weren't given any silver wear or napkins. Our burgers came cooked rare when we ordered them well done and our glasses were empty. We asked for the bill and had to wait another 25 minutes for her to come. we love chilis but because of this horrible experience I don't think we will be going back to the Chico location ever again.

Jacquelyn M.,"Chico, CA",48,91,8,1.0,4/12/2013,"First let start by saying i have gone to Chili's on and off throughout the years and i have never had a problem until last night., in fact i have really enjoyed the experience. Last night, was a different story. i would like to also say that i was a hostess/waitress for 2 years so i have a lot of patience with restaurants.. but last night was careless, lack quality control and Chilis employees should take more pride in their work.  Last night, my friend and i were hungry so we headed to a place that we usually can count on. First thing, that drew my attention was the original silverware i was given was visibly dirty ( it had green food bits on it). i politely asked for some more silver which was brought to me for about 20mins after i asked. The only reason i got my second pair of silverware was because they brought our appetizer over and i had to re-ask for it. Also i order a strawberry lemonade which was also not brought until our appetizer was came.  While we are waiting, another server almost gave our food the table behind us. We spoke up before they set the down the food. The next thing that wasn't right was.. i ordered a 6oz steak that i asked for Med-Well ( so the meat should of been slightly pink. i cut it and my steak was BLUE, is was RARE.. and the extra 6 shrimp that i ordered ( and paid about ($5-6 extra), 4 of them were the same size ( the size of a half dollar).. the two others: one was the size of a nickel and the other was the tail part of the Shrimp. That just shows poor quality control.  I stopped a server to ask if we could speak to our server, so i could straighten if i misspoke my order or if it wasn't really my fault. Instead of getting our server, she took my steak to have it cooked more. When i our server did come back we explained the shrimp thing and he brought us 2 new shrimp. Meanwhile, my friend had asked for texas toast and i asked for a side a butter. When i got my butter for my broccoli.. it looked like a side of  clear oil. i tested it and it tasted like oil.. not butter.    A manger was coming by to all the tables, so we explained all our concerns, meanwhile,  my friend still hadn't gotten her toast. The manger offered us 6 new shrimp and did admit to noticing that the shrimp was at bit ""shrimpy"" . i declined the shrimp because the server we had took care of the problem. The manger took the shrimp off the bill. i asked the manger if the butter normally comes like liquid.. she yes and said the butter comes in blocks and they melt it down and they only sides of butter they have that are solid butter is garlic butter.  When my friend finally got her texas toast, she lifted it and the plate it  was on was DIRTY!  She had dried blood  protein from meat on her plate under toast. WE informed the server of the problem and once again the manger came over. She offered us free dessert, it was a cookie in a skillet with ice cream. I asked my friend how her food was.. she said her rice"" had now flavor.. no salt or pepper"" and the "" chicken was rubbery"" We didn't eat a lot of the dessert because the cookie was dry and crumbly.  WE did pay and tip ( we tipped because the restaurant did make an effort to make it right  and i wasn't sure who was really to blame for the whole experience. )  Needless to say, we will not be back for awhile.  **** One thing did notice was the Restaurant is being remodeled... visually the restaurant look fine before.. maybe instead of remodeling they invest in better staff that actually care about the food they serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3?start=40
Patricia H.,"Redding, CA",25,154,,4.0,10/21/2012,"I used to hate this location because the manager was super creepy. I don't know if it is finally a new manager or what, but I can finally stand to go here without feeling like I need to run out the door because that creepy manager is staring at me again.  Having recently given this place another try, I'm shocked that I like it so much. No sign of the creepy manager, and a significant improvement in the food over the last few years.

Then i asked politely to speak to her manager and she was like uhhh why and wouldnt go get her for a few second so we just stared at each other lol.  -She even messed up and put someones order in twice, and forgot to put in his girlfriends order. -The manager i didn't get her name but shes a short thicker lady, VERY NICE!

Cheese fries would've been good if they were hot & fresh but they came out with cold, hard cheese.. they had clearly been sitting for a while. Pickle fries were awful, I do not recommend! They tasted EXACTLY like McDonald's pickles with a thin, tasteless, crispy batter. We ordered 1 sprite & 2 skinny patron margaritas- we got 3 sprites & 2 extremely sweet margaritas that you could hardly taste any tequila.. We took a few sips & left them alone.

No refills, food took forever, wouldn't honor our coupon and seemed like she got some enjoyment from saying no.  Seems she's taking it out on people, was very condescending and pretty much ignored us the whole time.

Janel R.,"Paradise, CA",249,59,86,4.0,11/3/2014,"Chili's is your classic chain restaurant known for their baby back ribs. I've never tried them because I don't eat ribs in public. :) But I have tried their soups, salads, and the Mexican-Americanized fare. And I have to credit them where credit is due. They are consistent, at least in my experience. The food isn't fantastic but I knew that coming in and I was served a meal that was exactly what I expected from a Chili's restaurant. We chose to go on a Sunday afternoon and since this location resides in a Mall parking lot, they were packed with hungry shoppers like ourselves.  The bar area was crowded with patrons glued to the two major NFL games that were playing. So our poor hostess had to wipe down a table herself just to make room for us. Our server was prompt and kind enough. He was always on top of our drink refills. Something I love when going out to eat. Our food arrived quickly despite the afternoon rush. I had a chicken soft taco with rice and beans. I was surprised at how flavorful the rice and beans both were. The soft taco was okay, but I've had better. My sister seemed to enjoy her bacon burger although she wasn't asked how she wanted it cooked. Her French fries looked fresh also. The price for three people came out to be quite reasonable. I paid easily via the little computers they have perched on each table and off we went. I'd definitely return since it's more satisfying than anything I would find in the Mall's food court.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3?start=20

Jesse R.,"Sacramento, CA",1,1,,1.0,7/17/2015,"Went to eat here with a friend for lunch. I am what you may call a chilis frequent flier. I come here often because they normally have great service, awesome on refills, and check in with guests frequently.  I can easily say this is the worst chilis experience I have ever had. The food took 40 plus minutes to come to the table, I've never waited this long for food at chilis before. The restaurant was dead, so it's not like they were even busy. The only good thing about the visit was that the waitress tried to atone for the slow service by giving us some chips and salsa while we waited. I had to ask two separate waitresses for a refill who looked visibly annoyed. When the waitress dropped off our food she left without asking us if we needed anything. I was THIS close to walking up to the bar and asking for a refill and a side of ranch. after waiting another 20 minutes with no attention she came up and asked if we needed anything. I told her I had been waiting a while for a refill and she quickly grabbed it but seemed completely unapologetic when I told her I had been waiting for a while. By the time I got my refill and ranch my food was cold. This was the most disappointing restaurant experience I have had in a while. The restaurant was also dirty, with dirty bathrooms and no soap in the soap dispenser. Not sure what is going on with this location but I think they need to reevaluate whoever is managing this location and letting it get this bad. I go to chilis for their quick food and good service.

As always the manager asks how everything was and you don't want to throw the college kids under the bus so you say it was fine with a smile.

The service is always terrible, the food is always previously frozen half reheated garbage, the drinks are weak, and the place needs a good cleaning.

Tommy W.,"San Diego, CA",4,3,,1.0,7/12/2012,"Well I usually don't post reviews but felt it was necessary regarding the last trip my girlfriend and I took here. We came there for a few happy hour drinks and a quick dinner. I think it started when our waitress would ask us if we were ready to order and as I was about to ask a question about one of the items on the menu, she was in such a hurry to get to her next table she just cut me off and said, ""I'll give you more time.""  My girl then ordered a ""Skinny"" Margarita which she tried and said was gross. I actually didn't believe her because she is very judgemental towards food and mixed drinks so I tried it. It was so sour it was actually beyond drinkable and believe me, I'll drink just about anything with alcohol in it. We told our waitress, she apologized, and said she would have the bartender make us a different margarita because she assumed it was just the style of margarita we didn't like. They made another, and it tasted the same... Absolutely horrible. I don't think I've ever refused a drink let alone twice but it was necessary as I truly think something they put in it had gone bad. I then asked the waitress if she could try a sip of it so I can prove we are not crazy but she wouldn't, neither would the manager. Which just made us seem like really picky drinkers, which we are not. I've had hundreds of Margaritas from different places and something was wrong with those two.  We then noticed that our food was dropped off at the table next to ours and the people started to eat off the plates. Once they realized their mistake they went over and took the food back from those people and I'm quite positive they weren't going to say anything until the manager saw my girlfriends disgusted face and walked over and said, ""So you guys probably noticed we served your food to the wrong table."" He asked us if we wanted chips while we wait but we had already ordered some (So I figured at least those would be comped)... Nothing was, not even the Margarita It's too bad because I enjoy the beers and chicken strips and the price isn't terrible but service is a big thing for my gf and I and now they will never have the pleasure of our business again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3?start=60

That being said, I still have not been totally satisfied with either the food or service. The most recent visit was just my boyfriend and I, and when we sat down, we were offered chips. No problem, except neither one of us knew they were going to cost us over $3. Nowhere on the menu is there a price for chips, and we didn't know until we got our bill. (from a business point of view, our waiter was a good salesperson for slipping the extra few bucks onto our bill) Next, I ordered a burger, which, I guess Chili's is famous for?? I asked for medium, got well done, and they don't season their meat, so there was NO flavor in my burger. It was also greasy. The amount of fries on my plate was laughable (read: very small amount). We also paid $8 for a couple small egg roll things that were so not worth it. We each had iced tea, paid our $2.50 or whatever for each, and not once were we offered a refill. This is not an isolated case of shoddy service and mediocre food. I have been to Chili's several times and hoped that each time we visited, it would get better. So far, they're getting worse.

I asked the manager about it, and told him about the texture of the chicken and he told me it is put through an oven with a conveyor belt. I have a lot of restaurant experience, and I can tell from the boiled consistency and texture that the chicken was put in there oven while the chicken was still frozen. I will say that the staff did offer to replace my chicken or cook it longer, but I was not going to wait for another sub-par piece of chicken because people that should barely be called cooks and the management staff are not smart enough or versed in cooking techniques enough to know how to cook appropriately.

""Meh, I've experienced better"" pretty much sums up my food.  I had the jalepeno burger and it was really just not at all exciting.  It lacked adequate sauce or condiment to make up for the large amount of meat, running on the dryer side.  Kinda left me wishing I had gone to Carl's Jr. for a jalepeno burger, or just ordered something else completely.  The fries are good though, I like the seasoning/saltiness.  Side of chips was very huge for two people as well.  I also noted that they have black bean burger patties to sub in for any of the burger items on the menu so that looks like something good to try, I appreciate more vegetarian options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chico-3?start=80
