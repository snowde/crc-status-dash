Louis S.,"Clark, NJ",14,29,5,4.0,7/31/2016,I gave Chilis in Clark another shot. There seems to be some new management and new staff. The food was good. Ribs steak and salads all came out as ordered and fairly quickly. The condition of the restaurant has improved with tables and floors clean and maintained. A much better dining experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20
Bianca A.,"Elizabethport, NJ",50,65,105,5.0,4/17/2015,First time at this location an their was just a 15 min wait but no biggie ...ordered some appetizers which cane out fast and the new Kiosk machine is great for games an u can pay ur bill on it an browse the menue as well ..waiter was very polite,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20

Martine V.,"Newark, NJ",54,53,278,3.0,4/17/2015,"I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. We went for Happy Hour. The location was right next to Barnes N Noble. It wasn't crowded when we got there so it was pretty quiet. We ordered some margaritas which were okay. They could have been stronger for the price they were charging. For appetizers, we ordered wings and sadly i found hair in my food. I had them take it back. The manager came by later to apologize. The rest of the food was good. It was okay, nothing special to rave about. As the evening progressed, it did start to get louder and more crowded. The waiter was okay, a bit hard to find at times but he was helpful, not as attentive as I would have liked. This place is a typical chain restaurant, so its a hit or miss when coming. Everything was overall just about average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20
Deanna M.,"Clark, NJ",5,13,1,1.0,6/24/2015,"The waiter was either extremely new or socially awkward. He was short and barely let us get a word out and we had to say the order two or three times before he got it. He spoke to us while leaning over another table ! And when we asked for a refill on a drink he told us it would be a whole because he had to drop something off at the kitchen and then make the drink .  Once the chips came they were cold . And when my friend received her steak it was barely cooked. She asked for medium and it was PURPLE ! And my chicken was ice cold! We sent her food back, they brought her back the same steak and it was still purple ! When we complained our waiter asked if we just wanted to eat it anyway.. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE ! I will not be going back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20
JD H.,"Edison, NJ",0,13,,3.0,5/21/2016,"Went there for dinner to take advantage of a triple reward points offer.  Management was clueless that it was going on.  Server didn't know if I would be credited triple reward point to my account either.  Despite the place being deserted, we were seated in a booth which had a 12"" tear in the seat cushion.  Common sense would be to seat customers in that booth last.  Guess common sense is less common than I thought.  Food was okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20
Meghan S.,"Elizabeth, NJ",13,57,34,4.0,11/2/2015,I have never been a fan of Chilis but I've been coming here quite often.. I usually come here to get their chocolate chip cookie skillet which is amazing. And they also have amazing chicken fingers. I really can't say anything about their food because the few times I came here I got chicken fingers. The wings are really good. Their steak taste like a normal steak nothing fancy. And the cookie skillet.. The service is ok. But the only thing I don't like is I went there once around 11 and I ordered fries and they were gross. They were closing in a few so they must of gave me the last of their fries before they change the oil the next day so I wouldn't come here late at night. I would come earlier so the food taste better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20

Liz J.,"Caldwell, NJ",220,162,110,3.0,11/27/2014,"I like this Chain. This was my first time at this particular location,  and it was ok.  The interior is definitely nicer than other locations I've been to. This one had more of a Sports Bar look.  I had a specialty magarita that was way too sweet,  but a good amount of alcohol.  I believe it was the pineapple,  and a berry magarita. I hope this isn't the taste of all of them...if so; someone could go into shock.

Juan D.,"Corolla, NC",0,4,,1.0,4/1/2016,The worst Chili's in the world.   Badly managed and bad attitudes from the staff.  First and last visit to this location.   I never had a bad experience at a Chili's before.   Made me wait 30 minutes when there were many tables available.   Asked for a table that was open for over 10 minutes and was told i wouldn't get a table until  everyone else in front of me was seated regardless of size of party.  Bathroom extremely dirty.  Appetizers and meal bought at the same time.  Steak over cooked and dry.  What a waste of time and money.  Bottom line this place sucks just stay away.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20

Brittany V.,"Fort Lee, NJ",15,13,,3.0,1/23/2015,"I used to always enjoy my time at Chili's, but this most recent visit, they were out of a lot of things; more specifically their drinks. I had to order a drink 3 times before they could come back with a beer on tap that was in stock. The waiter was genuinely sorry for the inconvenience. You could tell they were a little short staffed at the time because they couldn't give us the appropriate attention my table needed. I'd be willing to go back again though because this was my first ""meh"" experience with them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20
Amanda D.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",0,50,,1.0,12/6/2015,"Extremely dirty.  I could not believe the amount of garbage on the floor, straw wrappers, food, crayons, all over the entire restaurant's floor.  They have two hosts on the weekends, and I never understood why they did not have the responsibility to wipe down the menus.  Very unappetizing when you open a menu and there is old food, and stains all over it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20

Jane P.,"Summit, NJ",5,34,10,1.0,4/8/2015,"I had a very unpleasant experience here. The service was great- I had a very nice waitress- but the food was just sad. I have been here a few times before and all my experiences have been positive, but this time was extremely underwhelming. We ordered the wings, egg rolls and fried pickles and all were good except the pickles, which were way too salted- it was mostly batter and very small pieces of pickle. For our main courses we got chicken tostadas, sliders, and a fajita. They didn't even ask how I'd like the sliders cooked, so they were overcooked for my taste. The tostadas were nasty (just a pile of mush) and did not taste like anything. The fajitas included only SIX small slices of beef and they were very skimpy on everything- even the cheese. I will not be returning to this Chili's ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20
Natalie A.,"Clark, NJ",50,205,474,5.0,10/8/2017,"Yes it's a Chili's, yes it's not fine cuisine, yes I know it's a chain and I'm giving it five stars. For all that Chili's is, this spot is consistent and has some great service. There are so many great waiters at this location and the service is consistently good.  The food is pretty good, especially their Mexican dishes, try their chicken and shrimp fajitas! They swap out the menu seasonally but keep classic items on all the time. They switch out some appetizers, entrees, and desserts every so often and the food is good. It's sort of like comfort food here and it's a comfortable spot to go sit and relax in while chowing down on some delicious food. The drinks here are pretty great as well. Who can beat $5 presidente margaritas? They are strong and tasty!  Happy hour specials and always rolling out coupons and deals online as well. Plenti card members get emails and discounts sent to use here.  I hadn't had one of their molten lava cakes until a few years ago and I'm pretty hooked now. I've tried all of the different variants but the original is the way to go. Such a delicious dessert. I've even come here just to get that!  This location is often busy but they keep everything clean and as I mentioned before, the staff are great. Friendly and efficient service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2
Eva Z.,"Westfield, NJ",23,33,24,4.0,12/16/2017,"It's been about 3 years since I've been to this location . I noticed the menu changes and physical changes of the restaurant . I ordered the coconut rum punch and the chili chicken entree . The drink barely tasted like there was alcohol in it , but I finished the whole thing because It helped curb the the spice in my entree . The chili chicken entree was hot and seasoned very well . My boyfriend ordered the steak fajitas , which were also on point with the seasonings and I enjoyed the black beans he had on the side . Additionally , I appreciate they are very generous with the chips and guacamole appetizer , we could barely finish it .

We only came for the cheese queso app and deserts. Our deserts r the same we order all the time but they didn't put extra finesses as they always done in past must have been the chef. Overall food was decent and deserts still warm. I like going there for use of my Plenti points.

In addition to that ..when you do get there.. it's very rare the person at the register will even greet you..let alone acknowledge the fact that your even there (this has happened several times and the place was almost empty!!)  I called my order in around 7.. they said it would only be 30 minutes..I gave them  45 mins because I had to run other errands.. I get there and the person took my payment ..came out with other food (none of which was mines ) .. didn't say anything to me and proceeded to give the person that came in ""after"" me ..there food !? I'm like ""hello""-is my food coming out any time soon !!!? The person then went to the back and took another 5-10 mins to bring the food out that was already called in !?

Great air conditioning going on here.  I went with the Caribbean Salad. Love the fresh fruit they put in it. The portion was just right. I used to come here for the crispy fingers years ago.

But this location and this particular restaurant definitely served its purpose We came here for happy hour and we are from NY and the prices were just right we have never been to chilis and we were just amazed at the options and the appetizer options. We had maybe 6 drinks and ordered 4 to go appetizers and our bill was less than 60 which was beyond us.  The service was great. We were seated right away. I forgot our sever name but he was so chill he gave us enough space, didn't linger but was always right there if we needed a drink or anything else to order.  We also had dessert it was some kind of brownie with ice cream and fudge and I'm not sure if it was all the drinks or it was the fact that it was actually really good but it tasted amazing.

It was good and the quac is a bit spicy which I love.  For a meal I went with the Bacon Ranch Quesadilla's and my gf decided on the chicken fajita's.

It's not. I think people come for cheap drinks at the bar.  They've updated the decor, and it looks nice.  However, they need to do something about the quality of the food, and train their servers better. They're slow, inattentive, and often get the food orders wrong.  Also, the food for the ""To Go"" is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS luke warm at best. Yuk is the best way to describe the food here!

A friend and I ordered an appetizer and before we could even begin to eat, my plate came out but hers was no where to be found. So by the time hers came, mine was cold sitting on the side of the table.  Needless to say, I've experienced better hence the 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=40

Shawn D.,"New York, NY",169,4,,2.0,11/8/2015,"Atmosphere is the usual Chili's experience. The waitress was very nice, yet very slow in getting our drinks delivered. They arrived after the appetizers. This was probably due in part because we were seated right by the kitchen and whatever antics were going on in the kitchen, it was very loud and unprofessional. Furthermore, There was a gathering of female servers crowded around one male server by our table and the kitchen, spewing everything unprofessional and acting like a know-it-all. It disrupted the quiet dinner I was having. The food I ordered was not prepared properly. I asked for the dressing to be on the side for my salad and and was served with dressing on the salad. I would have stayed and ordered another drink or two, but the loud sounds coming from the kitchen and having to listen to a know-it-all server spew BS rather than worry about his tables made my experience bad.

The place does get very crowded on the weekends and for happy hour.  Actually, I am always shocked at how crowded the restaurant is at all times.

K R.,"Manhattan, NY",5,88,88,4.0,1/30/2012,"You know what you're getting when you go to Chili's. You have to be in the mood for the salty, bad-for-you menu, with oversized portions. Even most of the salads clock in at over 1,200 calories! I'm a fan of the black bean burger, chicken enchilada soup, nachos, the new Shiner Bock BBQ burger and the guiltless grilled chicken sandwich. A lot of people like the fries, but I think they're way too salty and usually opt for a different side like steamed brocolli. The ""To-Go"" service at this location is usually pretty good, but last time I picked up an order they forgot my drink and served me soups that had nothing in the broth (server must have skimmed the top of the soup). Overall, you get a good meal here, like I said though, you have to be in the mood for what they're serving.

Caroline E.,"Bradley Beach, NJ",120,2,,2.0,11/25/2012,"I haven't been at a Chili's in a long time and I've been to this particular location in the past.  This time around I wasn't impressed at all. I was there before choir rehearsal so we didn't have that much time and it was a week night.  We had to wait which it is what it is and I really didn't care much but was surprised.  But it also was after Sandy so people probably still were out of power and just wanting to get out.  So our time at the table chilling would be shorter.  Whatever. Since I'm trying to control swelling in old injuries, I decided to order the combo platter that they have and get the grilled salmon and shrimp with broccoli and rice.  Sounds healthy but no. The salmon had so much salt on it and the same for the rice and my poor broccoli was rotten.   I was horrified to see how degraded the vegetable was and how could they not see that, it was gray.  And they steamed it and put it on the plate and served it.  I had the server bring me more and digging into the bowl, I found more rotten broccoli.  When she came to clean our table I had a pile of rotten broccoli in front of me, do you think when I said again it still wasn't good that they'd knock something off the bill or offer me something else. They did not.   Both my dining partners ordered burgers.  The server did not ask them how they liked their beef and served both like hockey pucks.   Next time I'll pass and go to White Diamond or any other eatery in Clark before I go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=60
