Dallas M.,"Gilbert, AZ",458,230,419,4.0,12/20/2017,"I think it's important that I update my review now that I'm a frequent visitor to this establishment and my experience here has significantly changed since my initial review.   Their new menu is on point with the re-brand! Love that they're getting back to their roots.  The service at this location has been excellent every time we visit and I'm almost always visited by a manager now to check-in on our dinner. I love sitting in Stefan's section - he always remembers my food and drink order and is especially kind to my 4-year old daughter.   Food has always been great and consistent.  Overall, a wonderful place to eat for lunch or dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Allison K.,"Fort Worth, TX",22,72,256,4.0,6/18/2017,"Father's Day dinner with the family. Seated right away, very friendly wait staff, good food and no major complaints to speak of (other than the drunk guy at the bar who was screaming about the game).  Can I just say that their loaded queso blanco is soooo good?! It is thick and creamy and oozing with cheesy goodness. The taco meat in it was really good - loved the seasoning! What really caught my attention this visit was the new Mexican street corn. Dios Mio! The corn itself is plump and juicy, but it was the seasoning that just killed it. Spicy and savory and smack your lips good!! Definitely recommend and will be having that again.  Kudos to the wait staff who kept the drink and tortilla chip refills flowing. Great dinner and great service. Thanks, Chili's, for saving us from Applebees! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Tammy M.,"Cleburne, TX",2,28,3,1.0,5/20/2017,"Poor service, very slow.. Asked if the burgers were mustard.. was told yes .. Well guess what no mustard! Waited for 8 min for her to walk by so I can ask for some mustard.. Took another 5 minutes to get that! Burgers looked good but were very very dry. Hard to swallow they were so dry!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Doug G.,"Alvarado, TX",6,20,3,1.0,5/20/2017,Probably the 2nd worst ribeye I've ever had in my life and I've had many. The problem with the steak was the gristle. Tough and over cooked. Stick with anything other than steaks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Mark D.,"Henderson, NV",0,3,,1.0,6/15/2017,"9:00pm Thursday: The general manager for this restaurant should be fired. When issues are so pervasive, it's a management problem. I came in for dinner and every bar stool was empty. The bartender was leaning back against the cabinet with his hands in his pockets; The night manager was leaning against the post at the front door  watching; The bar top was filthy and there were two tables that needed cleaning in the bar area. Service was average: but you have to wonder with this attitude, what goes on in the kitchen. Will I go back, probably. Applebee's is across town and I really didn't want to drive, I'm guessing a county health person would give them a failing grade tonight. The 3.5 star rating is extremely generous,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Somer Y.,"Burleson, TX",86,14,4,5.0,11/18/2016,"We have always been to other locations and were a little apprehensive about this one. However, it was a wonderful experience. Waitstaff were friendly and attentive, hostess was so sweet, and food was great. I have nothing but great to say about this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Jade M.,"San Antonio, TX",204,645,1576,3.0,6/7/2015,"Pretty average Chili's. My boyfriend and I grabbed lunch here yesterday and our experience was akin to the Chili's back home in San Antonio. The staff were friendly and polite. The food tasted exactly the same and came out in a timely manner. We shared the triple dipper appetizer: big mouth bites, southwestern eggrolls and onion rings, and then both had soup. Ziosk pay method is a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Bugs C.,"TREVOR, WI",1,7,,1.0,5/13/2015,"The bar area and tables are disgusting and sticky. The floors are filthy and the bartender (who hasn't washed her clothes in a few days with crusty food all over her shirt) flagrantly flings beer everywhere. They allow smoking here and the patrons take full advantage, as it's apparently their daily ""hangout"". They sit at the bar, swear and spit their chewing tobacco into cups. I have NEVER been to a Chili's with SO MANY FLIES!!! The overweight waitresses mope around without a smile. This place is gross and dirty. Take your chances here, as I am not sure what you will catch. Where is the health department in this town?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
S H.,"Cleburne, TX",19,17,7,1.0,6/28/2015,"Chili's in Cleburne Tx, food wise, is pretty much the same as other Chili's. However, if you are NOT a smoker, Stay away from this one. I used to go occasionally, for a nice sit down meal. However, i never enjoyed it. The smell of cigarette smoke over whelmed any attempt at a decent meal. No matter where you sit. Add to that the need to wash what I wore to get the stench out. My last attempt, and the last I will ever try, was a few weeks ago.  Than again, if you are a smoker, keep piling on in there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Michael Y.,"Dallas, TX",205,178,5,2.0,4/14/2015,Food was decent.  What made the experience bad was the smoking area by the bar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Tommy B.,"Georgetown, TX",3,13,,3.0,7/9/2015,"Same quality as any other Chili's. It was over crowded, long wait for tables and still a smoking establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Hailey G.,"Grapevine, TX",151,149,36,4.0,2/20/2015,"Chili's used to be one of my favorite restaurants. That was before I knew anything about food. But I must say, this is my favorite Chili's location out of the 5 or 6 I've been to. It's nice inside, mediocre service, okay food. Not my first choice but not that bad overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Lolly G.,"Cleburne, TX",0,10,,2.0,2/29/2016,"This Chili's has really gone downhill recently.  We waited 5 minutes at the desk before anyone even acknowledged our presence, and they weren't busy at all.  There was trash on the floor which was a turn-off.  We ordered nachos and they were very tasty; but then we got our margarita chicken which was barely cooked and we had asked for it well-done.  I'm not sure if they were just short-staffed or the servers just didn't care, but the service was less than brisk.  We eat there often and we'll probably go back since Cleburne doesn't have many options, but they need to clean up their act and get some real management in there or people will stop eating there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Alisa C.,"Rio Vista, TX",60,141,443,2.0,7/22/2013,Same as all the other chain restaurants. Nothing special. The service was mediocre.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Rusty S.,"Ponder, TX",6,22,11,1.0,3/15/2015,"Very disappointed with this location. Told the wait would be 15 minutes and we received a buzzer when our table would be ready. Buzzer never went off and after checking on our status, I noticed that out name had been crossed off. We were 3 feet from the hostess stand. Did I mention that the waiting area is a few feet from the ""smoking allowed"" bar, which if you're not a smoker, you will smell like it afterwards. Service was less than mediocre. Ordered sweet tea and kept getting unsweetened refills. I have the Cajun Chicken Pasta at every Chili's I go to. I have had awesome dishes of this and needs help dishes as well. The Cajun Chicken Pasta at this location was probably in the bottom 2 of what I've had.  I am used to shredded parmesan cheese not the sprinkles you put on pizza. Very watery sauce. This is my favorite dish at chili's. I've eaten this dish hundreds of times. I know what it should and should not look like. This one was no where in the area. Someone please help this location. Did not even come close to expectations. I did not contact management. They were busy and the smoke was a little much to keep taking in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Diana D.,"Dallas, TX",413,694,344,3.0,7/31/2012,"dude, it's chilis! i have good memories of hanging out at my suburban houston neighborhood chilis when i was in high school, and so i got a kick out of going here for lunch today. there are not many places i'd wanna eat in cleburne, so chili's it was. lunch crowd on a tuesday afternoon was pretty busy, but we were seated and served pretty efficiently. i got my chicken fried steak with corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, and texas toast. it was exactly like i remembered it to be from high school--delicious!. way to be consistent, chili's! for what this place is--unoriginal, fast, cheap chain restaurant in every-town-america, they are a good value. i remember paying ~$10 for my chicken fried steak in the early 2000s, but now it's $11.10. still a good deal! unforch, half the space is reserved for smokers, but you can still smell it in the non-smoking area. yuck!! will i come back here? no. do i recommend this place? yes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Todd S.,"Tyler, TX",58,298,211,3.0,3/26/2012,"Typical small-town Chilis. Small bar area. Food was standard Chilis fare. Reliable, but not spectacular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Peter C.,"Fort Worth, TX",183,33,74,3.0,6/10/2010,"Yep, it's a Chili's. Unfortunately, they still allow smoking at the bar, so you're hit with second-hand smoke at the front door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
Thomas T.,"Cleburne, TX",6,5,,1.0,9/23/2013,"Never got to eat- walked in about 2pm on a Tuesday... noticed 4 customers in the entire restaurant... waited for 5-10 minutes to be seated, but instead all I saw were the wait staff standing around talking about makeup and who is dating who... so I ended up leaving",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
kristen p.,"Godley, TX",26,221,17,3.0,3/24/2010,"I'm not really sure just where people in Cleburne go out for drinks but we ended up here. They do make them strong though and I made the mistake of asking them to go gentle on me when I ordered the second one. Unfortunately I was ordering a sex on the beach. Oops! Once nice thing about Chili's is that if you go to their web page you can print out a ""Vegetarian Menu"" which basically lists everything that is and can be substituted to give you more options than just their black bean burger. I love it when corporations are thoughtful of us Vegetarians out here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cleburne
