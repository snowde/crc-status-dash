Amy L.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,27,6,4.0,12/4/2017,"This Chili's location has seriously stepped up its game.  I used to frequent this location weekly for years since 2009. Over the years the food prices seemed to go up as the quality, atmosphere and service went down. I stopped by this weekend after not having visited all of 2017. I was pleasantly surprised. Despite coming to a busy dining room at 6:30 on a Saturday night we were sat in less than 10 minutes. Our server was prompt and very friendly. Our drinks came very quickly as did our appetizer. Our food was served very hot and the quality far surpasses anything I have gotten from Chili's in the past few years. 2 cocktails, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees resulted in our bill being a modest $62 pre-tip. This Chili's will be back on my list of affordable, quick dining options in the future :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18
Carolyn K.,"Berkeley, CA",1,39,2,2.0,12/29/2017,"My mouth tastes like charcoal.   I found $30 worth of Chili's gift cards in my desk, so, since we were out in Concord, decided to have lunch there.   Compliment first.  Our server was excellent.  Knowledgeable, funny, checked in.  Good service, thank you.  But, I ordered crispers, asparagus, and onion rings.  Husband had beef fajitas.  They were ok he says.  Everything on my plate tasted like it had been cooked on a badly washed cast iron griddle.  Charcoal and rancid oil.  The asparagus was not trimmed and was raw.  Still tasted bad.  We gave a full tip of course. Food isn't the servers fault.  Won't be back though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18
Harvey K.,"East Bay, CA",4848,492,2816,4.0,11/30/2017,"Chili's was one of my affordable luxuries back in my high school and college days. It was the #1 dinner spot for my friends and I, usually after pickup basketball or a movie. Sadly, changes in people's dining habit and other economic factors have pushed restaurant chains such as Chili's to the brink of irrelevance. I haven't eaten at one for years, but a chance invitation brought me to this chain's Concord location a few weeks ago. After officiating a basketball scrimmage at a nearby school, I was invited by my crew to have a postgame meal here. We walked in at 8:55pm on a Tuesday evening and found the restaurant to be pretty empty. Initially, we were seated at a booth. But since we were so close to the 9:00pm happy hour, we asked to be seated at the bar area instead. After relocating, a male server, whose name I forgot, came by to introduce himself and took our drink order.  Since I didn't see anything that's interesting on the happy hour menu, I decided to do the $22 dinner for two deal with my friend Sarah. She chose the Southwestern Quesadillas and I got the Crispy Chicken Crispers. For appetizer, we got the chips and salsa so that the entire crew could share. Others ordered food off of the happy hour menu. The chips and salsa came first along with our drinks. Our server spotted us sharing the small appetizer and he quickly took it back and exchanged it for a larger size. His nice gesture was appreciated by all of us. Food came soon after. Sarah's quesadillas looked pretty good. My chicken crispers came with five decent size strips of chicken breast, corn on the cob, and fries. The seasoned batter was crispy and the meat was moist and tender. The corn on the cob had a bit of butter on it and was pretty sweet. Fries were very fresh and crispy. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  Service was exceptional. Our server was attentive and showed great hustle taking care of our requests. My crew and I were very satisfied, both with the food and his service. I was glad I had a chance to eat at a Chili's again. Not only it brought back some fond memories of mine, but it also reminded me that chain restaurants do have a place in neighborhoods and can have good food. Although it may not be a frequent occurance, but I will come back again. BONUS MATERIAL: - Large on-site parking lot. Don't leave valuables inside your vehicle. I was told by my Concord counterparts that there were some break-ins recently at that lot. - Major credit cards accepted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18

Victoria L.,"Orinda, CA",232,435,1836,5.0,1/2/2017,"Food: 5/5.    Price: 5/5.     Service: 3/5.    Ambience: 4/5 Another great visit trying some of their new BBQ items! We had the 3 meat combo and enjoyed all 3 - jalapeño-cheddar smoked sausage, hand-battered chicken crispers(honey chipotle), and half rack of house-smoked baby back ribs($2 extra, Texas dry rub). Everything was served with New roasted street corn, homestyle fries, chile-garlic toast and house-made garlic dill pickles. The chicken crispers and baby back ribs have 4-5 flavors to choose from, and I loved our choices. As for the sides, the roast corn was definitely the best! Of course we ordered my favorite appetizer: Southwestern Eggrolls. A Crispy flour tortillas stuffed with juicy smoked chicken, black beans, corn, jalapeño Jack cheese, chopped red peppers & spinach. Served with avocado-ranch sauce. It is super special and I've never had anything like this at other restaurants, definitely a must every time!   Three For Me deal was another steal, with just $10! Start off with either a house salad or tostada chips & salsa. Next, choose your fajitas: Chicken or Carnitas. Finish with a delicious Mini Molten Cake. The fajitas was about 1/2 of the original size, but it's a great combo anyway. After 5+ visits, here is my compacted list of my favorites in Chili's menus: Favorites: * Southwestern Eggrolls ($8.99)  *Triple dipper ($11.99) - southwestern egg rolls, crispy cheddar bites, spiced Pablo onion rings  * Ultimate Smokehouse Combo ($17.99+2) - 3 meats: jalapeño-cheddar smoked sausage, hand-battered chicken crispers,  half rack of house-smoked baby back ribs (add 2.00). Served with New roasted street corn, homestyle fries, chile-garlic toast and house-made garlic dill pickles. * Three For Me ($10) - House salad +Carnitas fajitas + Mini Molten Cake * Fajitas ($12.99) - carnitas & prime rib (+ $1.50). Sizzling fajitas served with bell peppers & caramelized onions, topped with chipotle garlic butter and chopped cilantro  * fresh mex pairings ($9.99) - beef enchilada, green chile chicken enchilada, chicken quesadilla. Served with citrus chile rice and black beans.  * Lunch Double Burger ($8) * Lunch pork carnitas fajitas ($8) * Lunch combo sides - southwest chicken soup, fresco salad,  house salad * Chips and Salsa ($3.39)  * Triple berry margarita($8.99) - Sauza Blue Tequila & Chambord Black Raspberry Liqueur with blackberries and blueberries, shaken with fresh sour & fresh strawberry purée Others: * Lunch Southwestern BLT Toasted Sandwich ($6)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18
Mike S.,"Concord, CA",2,16,4,4.0,8/29/2017,"Menu Selection - Very good Ambience - Good Service - Good Technology - Tablet at the table Parking - Plentiful, easy Access - Single point This particular Chili's has been around a long time. To their credit, it's been properly maintained, nicely updated and renovated. There's a separate sports bar with stools, lots of TVs, a couple of bistro tables and booths. The dining areas are divided up, which really helps with ambient noise, and reduces the feeling of crowdedness especially when it's busy. The innovative menu seems to have something for every budget and taste preference - burgers, TexMex/Southwest and lots of other interesting fare. The beef, chicken enchiladas I tried was really tasty, with cilantro Spanish rice, pico de gallo salsa, black beans cooked just right and not mushy. Price was very attractive and reasonable right at around $10 per order. I was hungry, and the portion was perfect. Went there around 8p on purpose because I prefer it peaceful and quiet, less chance of wildlings (bratty kids). Place is open til 11p, wow! Definitely on my list of late-nite haunts. I used the tablet to pay, and it was so cool. In a few short years, all restaurants will be thus equipped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18
Albert H.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",272,19,6,1.0,6/27/2017,"I decided to show my girlfriend chili's for the first time over the weekend and it was a disappointment. We ordered the new chips con queso which had quac and white cheese which wasn't good at all and the chips were so salty. I should have just stuck with the normal con queso but since it was on the happy hour menu figured I would give it a go - big mistake. The server was nice but wasn't really clear on the happy hour menu items. I wanted to get the honey chicken crispers but then when the food came out I got boneless buffalo wings. I asked the server to take the boneless wings back and I wanted the crispers instead.  We also ordered the combo fajitas with chicken, steak, and shrimp and again the food was too salty. The shrimp was very small and the steak was way too tough. The chicken was supposed to be grilled but didn't look like it at all. Then the crispers comes out and guess what? No honey sauce on it, just the crispers. The waiter tells the person that we ordered honey and to take it back. My girlfriend really likes corn on the cob but chili's still somehow managed to mess that up as well. This is CORN ON THE COB - either you boil it or just toss it on the grill. There was one part of the corn where there was salt/paprika and just ruined the taste. I have been to chilis a number of times but I can't see myself going back anymore. I have never had food so salty like that ever. There are plenty of other restaurants to check out nearby in the area but the quality of the food has really gone down hill. I would recommend avoiding this place at all costs and your money could be better used elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18
Louise T.,"Concord, CA",71,65,99,5.0,7/23/2017,"This is our weekly/monthly hang out. Kids love the Lava Cake, mommy loves the Margaritas, daddy enjoys the Cajun chicken pasta, my 2yo likes the chips..it's a win-win situation for all. They have healthy options like sirloin with asparagus. A 3 course meal with drinks for a family of 5 is only $50! That's a great value if you can share meals and you all have the small tastes in food.  Today, my daughter forgot her purse hanging on the chair. I called and they were able to save it for us to pick up. Thank goodness we didn't lose the rose gold Coach purse I gave her for her 10th bday.

Kat D.,"Pittsburg, CA",53,270,62,1.0,7/6/2016,"My most recent visit to this restaurant has deemed this place my least favorite of all the Chili's chains in the bay area. The service is seriously lacking when you aren't sitting at the bar. Went for date night with the hubby and had the two for 35$ deal. That includes margaritas with dinner. The drinks tasted like pure margarita mix. I even opted for the upgrade on the tequila, getting patron instead of the presidential. But I didn't taste anything but Margarita mix. We both ordered steak, I upgraded the mac and cheese. My steak was overdone. I ordered it medium well and it came well done. My mac and cheese was just cold noodles with hot cheese sauce on top. I didn't mention the steak because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for them to prep a new one. But i did mention the mac and cheese. Our server took my mac and cheese and came back 5 minutes later. She microwaved my dish. I could instantly tell because the dish was blazing hot. same little bite was taken out of the side.  I'm so disappointed. This location is close to my house but honestly I just don't want to chance coming back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18

Alwin S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,23,6,4.0,12/16/2016,"I usually come here for the deals and the lava cakes, it's a pretty nice place and service tends to be good. Today my girlfriend and I ordered a lava cake as usual. Midway through the meal, I felt a hair or something in my mouth, spat it out, and there I see something that was actually a dental floss looking material! Appetite being killed, we didn't accept the complementary desert, so we instead  asked if we could get an appetizer and they gladly allowed it. Our waiter Luke was very nice and accommodating despite the place being packed and busy. He handled the situation well since his manager was too busy to address our dilemma. Now yelp wants me to put mustard on this review, so I will continue and say that this chili's gets a higher review because of my own bias with it being in close proximity to me.

Jonathan R.,"Concord, CA",257,886,1047,4.0,7/13/2015,"When my best friend and I came by for lunch the other day I have to admit I had a few reservations. I've had many people very recently tell me how horrible this Chile's was, plus all the not so positive reviews on Yelp. However our experience at Chile's was actually pretty amazing. We were seated in the bar area which was packed and our server was Giovanni. On each table they have tablets where you can order and pay for your food, as well as play games. I'm not a fan of these things so I just moved it to another table.   We both had drinks; a tall 22 oz. glass of Sam Adams summer brew for me, and a very strong Long Island ice tea for my friend. My beer was very refreshing, but the Long Island ice tea had us both a little wobbly by the time we left.  They do a ""Dinner for two"" deal for $20.00 that was just perfect for us. You get your pick of one appetizer, plus two entrees, and the list for both is not bad. We ordered the chips and salsa for our appetizer which is endless, and I ordered the BBQ bacon burger for my entrée.  The chips and salsa come in massive quantity, but after having amazing chips and salsa the night before this batch was a little underwhelming. The chips are incredibly thin and the salsa was very watery. Both had pretty good taste to them, but when you're used to homemade nothing else really compares.  My burger was fantastic though. The size was somewhere between a slider and a giant burger, which was perfect. Everything about it was amazing; the patty had great flavor, the cheese elevated it, the BBQ sauce was rich and just enough to cover the burger but not make a huge mess, and even the bun tasted awesome. The burger comes with fries which tasted like they were made fresh in the restaurant. They tasted like actual potato, and they were perfectly salted. The burger also comes with a small cup of their homemade pickles that are AMAZING!! They are combined with big chunks of garlic, and are just out of this world. Once I was finished with the cup I asked for a larger cup which they happily obliged.  Even though we were both stuffed, and slightly drunk we ordered dessert anyways. The molten lava brownie is what jumped out at me. A giant brownie atop chocolate sauce, with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of that, plus the ice cream was covered in hard chocolate shell. This dessert is a shock to your taste buds in the best possible way. It's both hot and cold, with different textures, different flavors, and just a masterpiece. It's possible we caught them on a great day, but even if that's the case I would recommend trying Chile's, or for those who have, give them another shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18

Mike S.,"San Francisco, CA",95,337,29,1.0,10/16/2016,"Wow. Still as bad as I remembered it.  So why go back again?  My wife had a craving for fajitas so went there on a Sunday afternoon.    I had almost forgotten how bad the food was last time, and today's visit was yet another painful reminder.   This is to note the service was indeed decent.  We were welcomed with a smile at the door, and both of our servers were friendly and helpful.   But it's the food.  The food was/is truly subpar.   I remember when it was Sizzler's if you were on a budget and E-Bar / Chillies if you felt like balling out. The prices there are reasonable/questionable.  $18.00 for a big ribeye cut, while its at least $30 everywhere else.  Yea!  Questionable to say the least",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=20

Lol let's go for this little ride.. I want my baby back, baby back, baby back, baby back. I want my Chili's, baby back ribs, bbq sauce! Although I didn't eat any on this trip here, I did happen to enjoy my Wings over Buffalo, I opted for the smoky chipotle honey flavor. The wings weren't flashed friend enough for my liking but, the sweet and smokey sauce totally made up for it, was it worth the ($9.99) price tag? I'm still on the fence about that, but I enjoyed them, I totally cleared them off my plate. The staff here could pay more attention to the customer and make sure drinks are tended too, being that's what a bartender does, and making sure our appetizer and food orders are taken in a timely mannor. But sometimes it is what it is and in this case the staff couldn't blame it on NYE festivities, it was around 7:30 p.m. December 31, 2015 last year, soooooo....the place want uber packed yet and myself and my entourage (yea just like the tv show) were the only ones at the bar.  From what my friends had 11oz Steak ($11.99 a piece) they said both of their steaks and sides were made exactly to their liking, my other buddyl had the chicken quesadilla that he said was pretty bomb. We all cleared our plates. Could of been the Gin and Tonics and Beers we had leading up go our food, either way it was a decent overall experience at this Chili's location. This location is located off Concord Ave right next to the Premere Inn, with Shell Gasoline being right across the street and Highway 680 being literally right next to the Chili's. In my closing, everyone shouldn't be too new to a Chili's by now, but if you are. The menu option have something for the most seasoned to the newest restaurant, bar person. I know they make awesome margaritas and the star baby back ribs and chicken crispers are the bomb! The have a nice happy hour here..although I missed it go tonight..but all in due time.

Her tables, including us, were constantly looking around for Jessica and waiting on something. My friends and I were very disappointed with the service we received. Next time we will consider sitting in the regular dining area or not coming back at all.  Also, an employee that seemed to be off the clock was sitting in he bar area with her friends enjoying happy hour. She was drinking and swearing loudly, making her literally the loudest person in the bar area. Both servers made Chili's look very unprofessional.

Alexandra A.,"Hawaii Kai, Honolulu, HI",110,79,263,4.0,4/3/2016,"I've  came to this location a handful of times and I usually get the steak and shrimp fajitas. During the week this place isn't very packed but today it was. But the wait was only about 10 mins so it wasn't that bad.  I started off with the asparagus appetizer it's new on the menu and they were bomb!! They come fried with some great season on it. Tito's punch a new alcoholic beverage with vodka and rum in it, definitely good drink. They have a prime rib fajitas and a trio I ended up getting the prime rib and shrimp fajitas and let's just say I'd ordere them again they had so much flavor. I hope they keep the prime rib on the menu since it's new. I have to admit our waiter Kyle was really good he got to us right away brought out my fajitas hot and fresh. So the 4 stars is because our waiter and the cook came through thus visit. I'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=20

Ronald J.,"Concord, CA",0,16,,3.0,2/9/2017,"I love Chili's and used to be a regular, I'd come every Thursday night after class with some friends and just eat and talk over food.  A few hours ago my coworkers and I had a little dinner to say goodbye to someone who would no longer be working with us. Upon being seated, we are greeted by our server, Ronnie, who was very cute, attentive and upbeat. She took our orders and the food came out eventually, it was somewhat busy so I do understand the small delay.  I had a triple order of shrimp fajitas, and they were amazing, I highly recommend them.  So far, it sounds like my experience was great, but things take a turn for the worse, thus granting this rating to be 3 Stars. Most probably in an attempt to maintain the upbeat persona, our server, Ronnie, began some small talk, which was fine, until she came to check in on us a few minutes after our food had been served. Upon seeing my fajita skillet (which once held three orders of shrimp) empty, she exclaimed ""WOW. Good job."" I was slightly offended, considering she is a very, slender girl and I'm just not a fan of having people comment on my dietary habits, especially if there's an implication that I'm eating more than I should. Should she have been a bigger girl, it would have been more acceptable and I would have felt some sense of camaraderie, however, since she's not, i just took offense.  Things escalate very quickly once dessert arrives. Upon serving, she  misgenders me, and calls me ""princess"" when clearly I am male. I make it very clear that that is not okay and she explains that she overheard one of my coworkers calling me that. Yes, a coworker, someone whom I have formed a bond with over the years and have gotten to know and be comfortable around and mess around with, not some stranger whom I had just met thirty minutes ago. She did feel bad for her mistake (although I don't recall an actual apology), and didn't charge me for my dessert. I still tipped her very well, around ~40%, considering her services were great, and I did feel bad that she felt bad, however discounting a part of a meal does not wipe away the mistakes that were made, which is why I'm still writing this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=20

We waited 5 min to be greeted by the waiter. We ordered our beverages and our appetizers (loaded white queso & honey chipotle wings) and things seem to be ok. We browsed the menu and decided on our selections. The waiter came back with chips and salsa since we knew the queso woukd take a little while. Things were looking up. Our appetizers came. Wings were good, but our queso was missing the meat. Our waiter was no where to be found. Finally flagged down a different waiter and she took the queso away. House salad was warm, very little dressing. Still no waiter to be found. 25 minutes later my husband's salad Finally arrived, along with the queso which we'd been waiting for. At that point we didn't even want it. Our drinks were empty, our waiter was missing and he had taken the convenient mini-computer we could pay on. And so we waited. And waited. And waited.

Elen Joie B.,"Antioch, CA",59,26,163,5.0,3/24/2015,"I've been to different Chili's locations several times before but this is my first time at this specific location. This is also my first time absolutely loving every single thing we ordered in any Chili's before. My boyfriend and I came in for an early dinner on a Monday night. We ended up doing the $35 dinner for two. This comes with two margaritas, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert (such a great deal). For our drinks, I got a classic strawberry margarita (additional $0.50) and my boyfriend got the platinum Presidente margarita (additional $2). I absolutely LOVED both drinks. Best margaritas I've had in a while. Most of the time, when I get margaritas, they are either too watery or it seems like it's just straight up alcohol. Our drinks today were so perfectly made. For appetizer, we got the guac and chips, which were amazing as well. For entree, my boyfriend got the classic bacon burger and I got the cajun chicken pasta. The pasta was soooo good! The alfredo sauce was perfect (not bland and very creamy). And for dessert, we got the skillet toffee fudge brownie. By the time we got to dessert, I was pretty buzzed already yet I could still clearly remember how amazing this dessert tasted. Overall, a very great experience. Something that I honestly thought would be hard to expect from any Chili's. Also, great customer service. Thanks Gabe!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=60
Jamie D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,16,,1.0,3/18/2017,"When we ordered the $35 for 2 deal, the waitress (Angel according to the receipt) did not advise us that there would be a $1 substitution surcharge per entree. We come to Chili's probably 3-5 times a year. During each of the times we came before, we always got the $35 for 2 drinks, a shared app, 2 entrees and shared desert. The waitress always advised us before that the mac and cheese substitution was a $1 surcharge, but we were advised there was no surcharge for other substitutions. And, looking at bills, my mother had never been charged to substitute onion rings for fries before. After we had already ordered, people sat at the booth next to ours. I specifically remember the waitress saying something about baked beans being $1 extra and she told them she would do some favor to fix their meal for them, not to worry, she'd take care off it. I didn't think too much of it as I assumed she would extend the same courtesy for us if there was a surcharge that would be tacked on to our meal.  First, the waitress brought the wrong food. Then some guy delivered our desert to another table. When it finally made it to our table, already melting, the guy dumped it on the table with 4 spoons. I guess because I'm fat the guy suggested we share with other people, smirking with a tone.  When we received the bill there was a $1 substitution charge for each dish. Mine was expected, my mother's was not. When my mom asked the waitress about it, she got hateful--with a senior citizen--saying that it was printed in the menu so, essentially it was my mother's tough luck if she didn't catch the fine print. Angel got very belligerent, getting a menu and jabbing her finger at the menu in a triumphant tone, like sneaking a $1 surcharge past a senior citizen was some kind of victory. I think taking advantage of senior citizen on a fixed income sounds more like elder abuse. Why would any server try to hide a $1 surcharge and then essentially say ha, ha, jokes on you when the bill comes out? Her deception cost her $1.40 off her tip and we will never go back. To add to Angela's shady activities, as we were leaving, she was leaning into the same booth next to our, the same people she said she would take care of, letting them know she deducted $5 off their bill.  I wonder how many other people were cheated by Angel so that she could give her friends a $5 deduction from their bill tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=60

They were always busy, so I was not surprised that on a Sunday afternoon, Chili's Concord was busy as well. It's been years since WC closed and I think Ive only been to Concord one time other than today. We stopped in for margaritas, but both ended up ordering food as well. My husband had a Southern Smokehouse burger. It came with fries (lucky for him they were thick cut so I didn't steal very many). The $10.49 burger was cooked great but he was upset about all the pickles and lettuce that came on it (which I was happy to take all of).  I had eaten not long before, so I requested a custom order of fried jalapenos.  Their onion strings come with jalapenos, so I requested the onion strings, without the strings.  I received a small cup of perfectly cooked and fried pieces for $1.79.  Casey surprised me by ordering an infused (pomegranate/blueberry margarita) $8.99.  I stuck with what I know, the Presidente ($7.59 if youre okay with well tequila). It has brandy in it as well, be warned! I love these and think they're a great deal. Plus, the infused one was much too sweet - mine was perfect. Our server, Knecht, was awesome. Very friendly and attentive and happy to accommodate my weird food request and even ask the kitchen some questions on behalf of my husband.  She promptly brought our check and cleared our plates.  The woman who took our drink order when we sat (bartender, most likely?) made my day by IDing me.   We also saw her again working hard clearing plates at other tables.

Our waitress was good on maintaining our food and drinks and she was very nice.  The restaurant it's self is ok/good on cleanliness I did see some sticky spots on the ground and also some of the booths were still filled with crumbs which was sort of disgusting..

She actually started helping some people at the other end of the bar that sat down after me before she even gave me a menu or my drink.

She finally came by and laid the check down. I just threw down some cash and walked out. I didn't want to have to sit there forever waiting on her or deal with her crappy attitude.  I've never gotten bad service sitting at one of the high top tables and I would have sat at one of them but it was extremely packed and all that was left was the one end chair at the bar so I took it. Next time I will just not sit at the bar again. As a former bartender, take my advice blondie. Don't be a bitch to paying customers. You work off tips. Looks aren't everything.

We left a generous tip because we had a fairly good experience. However, one of our checks wasn't paid because the machine had an error reading a card. It was not made clear that the bill had not been paid, and we all had receipts, so we assumed we were all good to go. When we began to leave the restaurant, our waitress stopped us to tell us that one of the checks had not been paid, and began to treat us very rudely. It was clear that we were not trying to dine and dash, as 3/4 of our bills were paid & we left a tip almost equivalent to the price of the unpaid meal. However, the waitress quickly snatched the tip we left, and her demeanor completely changed, and she began to treat us as if we were high schoolers trying to steal a meal.

So we were sat in a booth by the hostess then pretty much ignored for a long time.  To count at least 3 people came over to ask for our drinks.  Still not sure who the waitress was. I usually bring a few things for my son to munch on or drink before we get food to keep him occupied.  We didn't have silverware and we didn't have napkins.  We still didn't have those things up until our apps and food came.  I had to get up and get our own from the server area.   We ordered a Cheeseburger for our son and it was the worst food Ive ever been served.  I honestly think that it was a day old burger that had been sitting out and then they put it in the microwave for 10 seconds.  It was horrifyingly bad.  I wouldn't have served my dog that burger.

Kevin K.,"Concord, CA",8,203,,3.0,7/14/2015,"Ok, it should be 3.5 stars but Yelp doesn't allow partials. Its the standard ol'semi-fast food, no differentiation in flavor edible items. Went with the Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad and had it once before. The first time, about a 9 months ago, seemed much better. This time, it was bland and needed extra buffalo sauce. The Mrs. had the Santa Fe Salad and was bored with it after 3 bites. The spicy 'sauce' was in the middle of the dish and not throughout so depressing. Our daughter had the Ribeye and it was done just right, maybe even alittle light of medium rare. Swapped out the broccoli for their new mashed potatoes and she was happy. Her other side was some southwestern mac & cheese and we'll not be ordering that again. Being able to pay at the table on the Ziosk was cool. We've done it now 2-3 times and it seems to work. It would be very nice if the games on the Ziosk were free during the meals - or free if you ordered $X of food or drink. Come on, how much money does that generate anyway? It was nice of them to disclose that the auto-tip calculator is using the ""AFTER TAX"" amount to generate the tip. Thus, with 8% tax, you're adding a tip on top of that so do the math in your head and adjust. We left 14% by the machine tally but were actually over 16% in reality when you base the tip $$ on the food/beverage cost. I don't want to tip based on the tax amount - who does that anyway! Another easy fix for Chili's to make if they want folks to keep using the Ziosk. The chocolate brownie/cookie ice cream thing for desert was very good when warm and we split it across three people - still a lot of desert but a nice finishing touch.

Their chips and guacamole. Wow what a let down. The chips were so salty if you dunked them in an aquarium you could turn a fresh water tank into a salt water tank instantly. The guacamole was worse than store bought. I'd prefer Trader Joe's guacamole to that oily limey green spread. The only things this place has going for it is a friendly waiting staff and good drinks. I'd come back here for their presidente margarita. Their 6 oz serlion was very delicious too. I don't know, just be careful what you order here.

Ambiance: You can expect to wait over 20 minutes on busy Friday nights and weekends. Otherwise, we have always been seated quickly. They do have a call-ahead wait list and you are added on the list before you even take a step in the door. I have used this a lot- it works. 2. Customer service: They really have done a great job with their wait staff, they are all incredibly helpful and always smiley. I have had 0 issues with the staff. 3. Food: We typically order either the 2 for $20 OR the Dinner and Drinks for $35. Both are really good deals. The food is consistently good and brought out quickly and hot. We are pretty picky with our food, and this place keeps us coming back. The desserts?! man oh man are they good (all of them!). 4 solid stars for this place, I will continue to be back.

(Not really searching as I'm not a fan of chain restaurants) being that I attended high school at Clayton Valley. I am very familiar with this location and have lots of high school memories so I found it very hilarious that they wanted to come here.

Terri N.,"Concord, CA",533,725,2908,1.0,10/19/2014,"I lump Chili's in with Applebee's as places I choose to avoid.  I've never had a delicious craveable meal at either spot, and this late-night dinner at Chil's with a friend was no different.  He suggested Chili's because he had a free dessert coupon and was acquainted with their 2 for $20 deal, which is admittedly quite a bargain, so I sucked it up.  Absolutely nothing was accomplished to improve my view of this dismal chain.   My friend was hankering for guacamole so he ordered us the chips & salsa with guac - he was expecting it to be tableside guacamole but it was pre-made.  Salsa was tomato-y and watery with no other distinctive flavor or heat, guacamole had a funky tang to it and was LOADED with sliced tomatoes, and though the chips were warm, they were very thin and glistening with grease.  *sigh*   None of the meal options for the $20 deal were especially tantalizing, so I played it safe with the Crispy Chicken Crispers (yep that's their real and ridiculous name), which the menu said would be served with fries and 3 sauces, and was actually served with fries, corn on the cob and 1 sauce.  While the chicken tenders had a decent flavor, there was an equal amount of batter as chicken.  Fries were fine, nothing special.  Corn on the cob had a weird butter-saturated flavor and withered texture.  And the ramekin of ranch dressing they brought was about 1/3 full.  My friend ordered the chicken & carnitas fajitas, making it ""Cadillac style"" by adding a side of rice and beans, which never arrived.  When we told our server, she said she would take it off the bill, but offered no explanation or apology.  Overall our server Alyssa was abrupt and inattentive - I always felt like I was irritating her, though we weren't making any special requests of any kind.  Her crappy attitude was returned in her tip.   Finally for the free dessert my friend brought home their Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie.  We shared it back home, and the cookie tasted very generic, vanilla ice cream was fine, and instead of the promised hot fudge, we got a ramekin of caramel that looked like someone had scraped the contents out of it, there was next to nothing in it.  Lame. So I hate to be a jerk but - eff you Chili's.  You remain consistently mediocre, and low prices aren't enough to solve your crimes against the culinary.  Food is generic, and servers are a-holes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=40

I can tell you that I've never met anyone chomping at the bit to eat here.  Still, it's been a safe alternative.  When I was thinking of proposing, I brought my girlfriend to Chili's to meet a friend who could tell me if she's good (she was).  Once when my inlaws flew in from Texas, they took the rest of my family to eat here while I was at work.  And most recently, they had a ""Chili's Gives Back"" night where 15% of our bill went to my daughter's school. What do you get?  Okay food at okay prices.  The two-meals-for-$20 is a good deal indeed.  Fries that are a cut above, but still not like McDonald's.  I had tasty Cajun pasta.  Slightly inattentive wait staff;  the restaurant was only a quarter full, and we still had to wait for six minutes after arriving for someone to even acknowledge that a party of three had arrived.  Bar area in the center of the building.

Michael S.,"Concord, CA",212,59,23,2.0,11/11/2014,"Is it company policy to provide bad customer service? I've been to chillis only one other memorable time in Oceanside, Ca and even there I received the same shoddy hospitality. It really is sub par customer service, they just want to make it through their shift and go home. Came in then a couple came in after and mad rushed to check in before us and the hostess said nothing and simply escorted them to their table, we then had to wait an additional 10 minutes. The girl who wrote down my name yelled out my name to let me know a table was ready, the only problem is I was still standing in the same spot right in front of the check in booth, guess I'm not important enough to remember for that long. The waitress was even worse,  possibly the worst waitress I've had in the last decade( Im looking at you HEATHER). She not only didn't pretend to smile but she actually had a frown the entire time she was working, she came by our table a total of 3 times, once to take the order, once to drop off food, and once to drop off the check, please note that we had to CALL her over 2/3 of those times; she never came over to us on on her own. Its not as if she didn't like us tho, she was just a lazy employee, she hardly helped any of the tables around us and pretty much hung out around the register chatting it up ( I have proof Lol). Everything about her was just awful, when she dropped off the food she didn't say hello she just dropped off the plates and then zipped away as fast as she could, she would walk by our table multiple times without even a glance as if we were a burden!! And she messed up my wifes order, my wife said no chopped cilantro and Heather even confirmed that Pico de gallo was ok and it was just no cilantro and my wife said yep thats it, my wife also wanted beans on the side; of course when she received her salad not only were there no beans on the side but there was no pico de gallo, after about 10 minutes of her walking by and ignoring us we got up and got right in front of another waiter and asked him to fix our issue, so its cool right? NO, not only did we not get an apology but they actually implied that it was our fault! They said "" oh see you said no cilantro so they took the pico off because it has cilantro"", we went ahead and showed them the menu that list the ingredients and identified that pico and chopped clantro were two different things, still no apology. I know what your thinking "" is that all?"", no it is not lol. After we asked for the check she dropped it off and asked if we wanted a box for some chip crumbs on the table(we're ok thanks), after she ran away we noticed that the veterans discount was not applied even tho she gave and took the vibrant green veterans menu from us! Since she was no where to be seen we got in front of the same waiter from before and he went ahead and discounted it for us, she came over and did not apologize and gave me a dead pen. I tried it for about 5 minutes and then I put the pen down and put on my zombie face to which she actually noticed and glanced at me, I then said this pen is no good, she then said ""aw"" and started digging through her pockets(still no apology). She gave me a new pen and zipped away per her waitress job description.  She did everything sluggish and if she is not someone's relative I refuse to believe that she can continue to hold down her position. Needless to say I did not tip, sorry folks but a tip is not something people get automatically, its something they EARN, its the only incentive for GOOD customer service after all. The food was actually not too bad and its the only reason they get two stars, well that and the fact that they support the troops(sort of). They messed up my wife's order so I can't speak for her meal but I had the California grilled flat bread and it was teeming with flavor, absolutely delicious, BUT NOT worth the horror that is their service department.  Stay away folks..... stay away.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=80

Though I certainly have not been a huge fan of Chii's over the years, I do find them to have stepped up the plate a bit with not only there recent remodels, though as well as with there food options. I was in splurge mode and I really thought the bacon ranch quasadillas just fancied my temptations. I usually hardly ever find anything appealing on there 2 for 20 deals though, this time I found  a winner.  For drinks, I ordered a Cosmo and my hun ordered a diet coke. The Cosmo was ok.  We of course chose the 2 for 20 thing, which comes with your choice of an appetizer and 2 entrees, within the selection of options to choose from. For the app, we went with the crispy onion and jalapeno strings. I of course, the quesadilla and my hun got the fajitas. Place was quite loud and hectic, definitely typical for a Chili's restaurant. Our server also was quite nice though, a little on the scattered side. She kept forgetting things. The crispy onion strings arrived quickly and my, there was alot! As bad as these little crispy things are for you, man are they good. Cheap but good. Quesadilla and Fajitas then arrived appearing less than impressive. My quesadilla on the other hand despite the sloppy presentation, tasted fantastic!! The combination of all the savory flavors of bacon and ranch sandwiched amongst cheese and a warm, crisp quesadilla certainly satisfied my built up temptation. Hun also as usual enjoyed his fajita's. We also got a free dessert by checking in on Yelp. Which we ended up going with the Cheesecake. It was decent but not great. Although, I love the new remodels that have taken place with all the chili's, I still find the environment too loud and hectic for me to ever want to make it a regular spot.

They sat us in what I like to call, the ""B section"" because it's where the subpar waitstaff go to ""work."" They're lazy, or new or have just been there way too long to do their jobs properly. Our drinks perpetually needed refills, they took forever to bring our order and our waitress had this look on her face that said 'I totally forgot you asked me for something but I just remembered right now when I saw your face but I still don't have that thing you were asking for.' Waiting tables is not hard. It's actually very easy. You just politely walk around in a circle asking people if they need things and refilling drinks. Sure, it's hard when you deal with assholes all day, but it's not *that* hard once you quit, get an office job, realize how hard that is, start liking people again and reflect on it. It's a small little circle that revolves around making sure a group of people (A) have drinks at all times, (B) have food to eat and (C) enjoy your company when you are present. And they have this pay-it-yourself machine where you pay your tab with a touch screen and have no interaction with the waiter at all. And they don't even ask if you would prefer the check at your table, they just assume you care about technology and will figure it out. I was there with my parents. I'm pretty sure I had to walk them through it the first time.  And the children. Oh my god the children.

I've worked in customer service for a number of years and the way we were treated was incredibly disappointing.  Our server, HAILEY was condescending and beyond rude. I ordered a buffalo chicken salad. When our food arrived, the salad looked like it had been made hours before being ordered. The lettuce was wilted, the ingredients were slimy and the chicken thrown on top was dry. I tried a bite of the food but, it was disgusting.  I mentioned the poor quality to HAILEY and she treated us like we were stupid. Because of the poor experience with the salad, I requested a burger. While my husband sat waiting patiently, his food got cold. HAILEY finally brought a burger but not condiments.  When we went to check out, we were comped for the burger and had to pay for the salad. I'm not certain the reasoning considering my dissatisfaction with the salad which cost more than the burger. Most alarming, no one bothered to apologize.  I'm not certain why Chili's would want an employee that blatantly hates their job, reflecting it onto others.

I was starving and was actually about to get up and leave considering I was watching the table next to us get much bigger appetizers served to them, and all we had had so far is our waters but the manager had come out and hand delivered our appetizer to us, free of charge. It was nice, although an inconvenience. I felt very happy after the manager had told us she had gone and prepared it herself since it seemed to be such a problem.

Terry N.,"Concord, CA",1,21,,3.0,9/10/2015,"I recently ordered home delivery from Chili's AND ordered for take out just a few nights large because one item on he menu was THAT GOOD!  It was the baby back ribs with the Dr. Pepper bbq sauce.  I only got a half rack that's why I was hankering for more just two days later and had to go in and order it again and was not disappointed. However, you might be wondering why then, I only gave them 3 stars and the answer can be explained by one of their other dishes on the menu.  It's called a Fresh Mex Bowl and comes in different varieties like Cicken or beef and it is sort of a bad imitation of Taco Bell's  Cantina Bowl and a taco salad though it doesn't imitate either one successfully.  I ordered the Pork version and it was described on the menu to sound mouth watering, juicy but let me tell you it was the exact opposite.  I could not even recognize the gray, brown, clay-like mass as succulent pork. The taste was positively abhorrent and disgusting.  Just recalling it refreshes my gag reflex.  The dish also contained a ""special corn and rice"" concoction I forget their words but it sounded tasty with some kind of unique delicious sounding tart dressing (again the description reminded me of Taco Bell's  rice and corn mixture with a tart cilantro lime dressing that is quite good especially for fast food.  Well, Chili's version was some horrid mess with a gelatinous goo they claimed had some chipotle included.   It looked like the slop You might feed your farm swine if you didn't value it much and it tasted worse than anything I've ever had in my mouth going in or coming out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=100
Kuei U.,"Vallejo, CA",0,113,,2.0,10/11/2015,"Lost and starving! Could not find a decent place to eat anywhere. So, for the 2nd time in my life, I ended up at Chilis. The last time had to of been 25 years ago. There were only 2 of us, so they put us on the smallest table on the planet with a stereo speaker blasting us from above. The table was 18"" square with booth seats that were about 3"" narrower.  Then they insist on cramming all of this yuppy fad bs on the table which took up half of the table. Some stupid, lcd gimmick to try to make you feel like spending more money than you need to is cool. Then, of course, all of the popup menu specials and condiment racks. I was able to get rid of these.  I ordered the steak fajitas, only because it is really hard to screw them up. My ride ordered the salmon with rice. We also ordered egg roles for appetizer. The egg roles arrived first with ranch sauce for dipping. Excuse me? Ranch on egg roles? This is not a carrot stick. They must be trying to save 3 cents by not giving you actual egg role, orange dip like they did 25 years ago. 25 years ago these were made with fresh ingredients. Now they taste microwaved and mushy inside. Why don't we just call these things pre-turds. They put some funky sauce on the salmon to try to cover up the poor cut of fish. This is the same salmon you see for sale at Safeway for $4.99/pound.  The rice that came with was not worth eating, unless you are homeless, in which case, might seem to be a tasty treat over taco bell garbage scraps.  As for the steak fajitas. What little meat there was was quite tasty. They did not make the mistake of grilling the steak with the veggies, which some places do. That just ruins the meat. The meat was grilled and seasoned well. The included veggies came with an onion butt. You know, the part of the onion that most people throw in the garbage. It also included green, bell peppers. The veggies were clearly over cooked in grease instead of being grilled like a real restaurant would do. As for the service, yup, another limp, wristed, male waitress. I'm sorry, don't these boys have fathers? Males should not be waiting tables, especially this one. They are clumsy and inattentive. This one made a fool of himself by knocking over a woman's plastic mug of water sitting next to us and completely soaking her from being to frantic and clumsy. Only really low quality places serve water in plastic cups. The $45 bill was way over the top for the quality and quantity of food we got. My dog was happy to get the salmon though. Maybe, in another 25 years, if we are lost and starving, we will find another Chillis, and then just keep on looking for somewhere else to eat.

Our server seemed nice and I'm sure service would have been fine if the manager (middle-aged brunette female) hadn't stepped in. Had a slight ""issue"" our server needed help addressing (VALID out of state ID) so he grabbed the manager and she immediately approached the table aggressively and just told us we were wrong. I understand that they're corporate and need to be extra careful with proper ID, but the way the manager handled it was completely unprofessional and inappropriate. Then our server cowardly treated us like the red-headed stepchild the remainder of the evening, hardly checked on us and dropped the check after having only been there for just nearly a half hour (dinner for 4 including drinks, appetizers & entrees).

Elizabeth E.,"Bridgewater, NJ",27,83,,1.0,1/28/2013,"I used to frequent Chili's a lot when I lived in the South Bay - there are a few locations down there that are pretty decent, but good lord - the Chili's in Concord is awful. I've placed To Go orders on 3 separate occasions and the last time was the final straw. Put my order in online for a simple meal for one person - easy stuff.  My order was promised at 5:04pm. I arrived at Chili's promptly and there were some other people waiting, no big deal.  When I finally got to the cashier about 10 minutes after arriving, she had an issue with the receipt printer and it wasn't printing my receipt. She seemed totally confused and kept walking away without telling me what was going on.  She then printed out a ""receipt"" listing my order but with no dollar amount and asked me to sign it.  I'm no moron, so I said ""No."" - I'm not signing anything without a dollar amount that I agree to!  I ask her if my food is going to be ready any time soon (By this time it was already 5:25pm) and she says ""It should be out shortly."" So she grabs the only bag sitting on the shelf for To-Go and walks it to a counter in the back.  She finally grabs a manager and the manager comes over to help reprint the receipt.  The manager runs off and I ask her, when she finally returns, ""Is there a reason it's almost 5:30pm and my food was promised at 5:04 and still isn't here? I need to speak to the manager.""  She seems pissed off now (why? I didn't do anything wrong and she's barely said a word to me about wtf she's doing) and grabs a different person entirely.   I explain the situation and she grabs the very bag of food the chick moved to a shelf in the back.  I ask her if that was my meal and she says ""It just came out."" to which I respond, ""No, it was sitting right there on that shelf when I walked in and the cashier just moved it over there."" Needless to say I asked her to void my sale and give me my money back.  I was starving and had already waited almost an hour (we're talking from the moment I put my order in, to the moment it was promised, then another half hour on top of that) and I wasn't going wait another 20 minutes for my food, so I wound up going to Taco Bell. The previous two occasions some similar BS happened so it's safe to say I will never be going to this Chili's again, even though the manager who was very apologetic was damn near pleading me to please come back another time.  Not going to happen!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=140

Katrina B.,"Bay Point, CA",2,10,1,2.0,4/24/2014,"While driving around to decide what my 9 year old and I would have for dinner while she's on spring break we ended up here at Chili's in Concord right by the freeway.  We were sat in a booth right away all the way in the back by the kitchen. My daughter noticed the kiosk that was on the table. It had games and a digital menu on it. We were not introduced to this new system, so by the time my daughter checked it out we had already been charged 99 cents, no approval needed. We took a little while to look over the menu and finally decided to order a large nacho with chicken and a side of guacamole. While we waited the waiter swept under the table next to us which I think is unsanitary. He also brought out 2 platters and a small silver cup. The silver cup contained a teaspoon size of guacamole(I promise I'm not exaggerating). I said what is this? It the guacamole for your nachos. I said you have to be joking for a large nacho you get 1 teaspoon of guacamole. He said yes and apologized and brought another small silver teaspoon cup of guacamole. Then the nachos came with 12 chips front and back with beans in between and a little bit of sour cream and a handful of lettuce. We never received a water refill. I think we were supposed to order it on the kiosk. I'm into technology but this was ridiculous. The food wasn't good and for 11 dollars for a nacho I could have went to the local taqueria.

Potato Soup was fine.  And the empty potato soup bowls sat on our table for over 30 minutes before our server finally cleared them and we asked for more tea.

Sat down and were handed menus.. I was so confused and overwhelmed by what to order.. I was so hungry, the menu was like a Rubiks Cube. I almost wanted someone to just make a decision for me.  Should I get a Skillet Queso? The Southwestern Eggrolls? Should I just order one of everything?  We were looking at our menus.. then we heard it. A big fatso at a close by booth started barking. Really. I waited and waited for this evening and is the reward I get? A f**ked up night at Chili's? This guy's cough sounded like a seal bark. Cough. Cough. Cough. I was waiting for whatever it was to launch out of his throat. Every few seconds.. Coughing fits. Loud ones mind you. Not quiet. The kind of coughing that is so freak'n disruptive and loud it scares small animals.. After (I kid you not) 20 constant minutes, I'm thinking to myself, ""Hurry up and die already.""  It disturbed everyone in the restaurant. Literally everyone. I don't know about you, but if I know that I'm going to cough repeatedly, then I will go outside.. Fatso had no common courtesy. Glancing around the restaurant, everyone was getting just pissed. Just when you are about to talk... take a bite... or you think he's finally barked up that piece of steak (the size of a Buick) that he's been hacking on... and you think to yourself, ""It's finally over"".. Thinking that Fatso has mercifully stopped.. Oh no. BARK. BARK. BARK. I couldn't take it anymore.. It had been going on for 20 minutes.  We all received our entrées and were miserable. So, I started to stand up.. Everyone said, ""Don't Andy. Don't."" But I couldn't take it. I couldn't!. I started walking over to the choking leviathan and everyone at the restaurant looked at me. They knew what was about to happen.. Then I saw her.. The guy's waitress. As I was walking over to him (to help obviously -wink), She knew what I was about to say.. and looked at me like a deer in headlights.. She looked at me like, ""Please, don't. Don't."" So, I smiled, sighed, wimping out and turned around and went back.  A few minutes later, she handed him his check and we all literally cheered once he was out the door and as he waddled away. OK.

Our regular server didn't even bother to attend us from the beginning of our experience to the end of it an yet I didn't even know her name since she barely came to check on us. Anyway LEXIE did an AMAZING JOB! My gf wrote a note on the receipt that the five dollar tip was for Lexie and not our original server but she then told us that she couldn't keep it because we weren't her table,  so I then pulled out a five dollar bill and told her ""here this is for you because you did a great job"".

We'd set it aside & then remembered it once we were out to our cars already...She's a saint for understanding the need to dig it out of the trash! & lucky us, we were able to retrieve it... She also worked several other tables with toddlers & infants, all the while being super accommodating, innovative, resourceful & again, cheerful...Thank you, GABRIELLE - we'll be back because of YOU! Here's the story: Went there last week for a birthday lunch for my brother - Yes, he is not into hoity-toity fancy-schmancy places. He's a straight forward kind of guy! It was me, my toddler son, my brother, my brother's best friend & her 2 kids (ages 3 & 4). So, big table - loud, hungry kids getting into everything, you get the picture! Food was great, can't go wrong with: eggrolls, potato skins, buffalo wings, burgers, big bite burgers & fries. My brother also got baby back ribs & salmon - both were great. I ordered some steamed broccoli for my son. It was steamed perfectly. The other boys shared a kids menu quesadilla & apple juices. The kiddos were content with their kid cups & crayons. They drew on their activity book menus so no meltdowns before the food arrived. Timing was great (which you really don't appreciate until you have kids dining with you!), Temps were great, presentation could've been better on the wings, but the kitchen must've missed it (wing sauce drips on the plate weren't wiped away) I am sure the servers aren't plating their own food. None of the plates were too hot to touch (which only happens if you leave them in the window too long!) which, again, is mostly only important for young ones who will touch everything. Drinks refilled frequently & to-go boxes, offered & provided immediately. I may have missed the offer for dessert, but we were all pretty happily stuffed.

Carol M.,"Pittsburg, CA",23,9,,1.0,10/3/2012,"Went to Chili's this evening for dinner, and I will never be returning. I ordered the ""sizzling"" chicken fajitas and was greatly disappointed when they arrived without any sizzle or steam coming from the skillet. The chicken wasn't impressive and the onions and bell peppers were pathetic at best. My dinner companion ordered the chicken fried steak and had to request extra gravy twice, because the first request was met with literally a tablespoon of gravy. The second request was met with enough to make due. The only reason that I gave even a one star rating is because the chicken fried steak was actually flavored nicely and once greeted with some more gravy was acceptable.  The server never approached the table after delivering the second request of gravy until he delivered the bill. The bill did come with what I felt to be the reasonable price of $29. We had placed our money in the tray, two twenties and received back the change of $11 in one dollar bill and two five dollar bills. My dining partner and I each felt it was rather assuming of the waiter that he would be getting a five dollar tip when he didn't really give acceptable service. We normally tip twenty to twenty five percent tip. Lesson learned and Chili's is no longer on our list of restaurants to frequent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=120

The server we had, Sean was more than accomodating. He assisted us with any question on the menu, asked if this seating was ok, our drinks were always filled, and he had the greatest positive personality and attitude towards us. Especially the time of day it was, he was more than amazing. He even brought us out an extra side plate that we didn't even ask for and in the end we did need it. More servers should take notes from him. I even felt as if we were a hassle asking him so many questions and things to get, but he was more than happy to cater to anything we asked him.

We sat down in the bar so that we could watch the games that were on. It took a little while for us to get our drink order in and then another 5 minutes to put our order in. That's partly because I wasn't ready and also because our server was pretty busy. We got fried cheese sticks, which were good. Nothing like deep fried cheese as long as they are hot. The marinara was ok. I like their ranch, though. I got the extra crispy chicken crispers. In reference to chicken, they were average. Portion size wasn't really all that. Our corn came out with nothing on it. It's supposed to have butter, salt and pepper. Our server brought us out 2 fresh ones. The french fries were just ok as well. Overall the visit was average.

Alexander E.,"San Pablo, CA",355,636,830,4.0,3/26/2010,"I've been a fan of Chili's for almost twelve years.  Chili's over Applebee's, Outback or Chevy's without hesitation.  I'm sadden to hear the closing of various locations due to the economic climate.  I really wish they would open one in the East Bay (Pinole, San Pablo, Emeryville) but Concord will due.  I've visited this location a handful of times and every time I can expect: quick service, friendly staff, quality food, reasonable prices, and a good atmosphere. Their menu rotates maybe once a year for variety and new entree additions.  Their signature item is of course their Baby Back Ribs which continues to be a great deal, in my opinion.  For $16 you get a full rack of ribs and two side orders, enough for two people or one big guy.  These rough times have led the company to run a 2 for $20 deal.  Two people can enjoy a appetizer, two entrees, and a desert for just $20. A great deal for the cash strapped student/couple.   Lastly, the service is always top notch with very few flaws for a corporate chain.  The young staff is eager to please as they sweat bullets for their tips and minimum wage.  I appreciate their fast and friendly service and always tip at least 20% but if service is lacking (rarely), I'll tip 15%.  For the decade plus that I've been a patron of Chili's, I've never been truly disappointed.

Turnaround: Poor-Good. They did not even wait for everyone's food to finish first so why the long wait? Service: Good. Courteous servers came often to refill water and check up on us. The entrees here are not exactly cheap, but they do not break your wallet either. Not to mention, the meals are pretty satisfying here. I did not finish my meal though I did not quite leave enough for another meal. Depending on the different lunch and combo deals, the pricing here is actually super cheap for a large meal. The food is good too though a little on the fusion side so the biased me do not particularly like the food enough to say, ""This is some of the best food I ever had!"" On that note though, I had the triple dipper with jalapeno burgers, honey chipotle wings, and potato skins. I enjoyed all three items, but the jalapeno burger were just sliders with cut up jalapenos, onions, and tomatoes. The wings were just fried chicken pieces layered in nothing, but a sweet, tangy sauce. The potato skins were crispy and covered in cheese, bacon bits, and green onions, but a tad on the greasy side. The turnaround was ridiculous though. After ordering, we waited and waited until finally the side salad for one my coworkers' lunch combo came and I thought the rest will come shortly afterwards. I went to the bathroom on the other side of the restaurant and came back after my business. Not only was no one served yet, but the coworker still only had her salad in front of her.

Always good service in the bar waiters and waitresses are always polite and fast to bring your order out. I never really sit in the restaurant area so I wouldn't know how the service is there. Good place to go for appetizers and a drink during happy hour but the actual meals never impress. Don't really expect much with the cheap pricing though so it's not too bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=160
Jane D.,"Discovery Bay, CA",62,9,3,1.0,8/1/2015,"Last week I went to the chili's in Pittsburg with a friend so were pretty familiar with the happy hour times and menu. Yesterday I was by the mall so I decided to go to the chili's in concord. When we walked in the bar looked pretty crowded so we asked the hostess if we could sit in the dining area and still get the happy hour and the girl said yes. After we were seated and our waiter come to the table my friend asked for a mango presidente margarita's, which she got last Thursday on the happy hour menu and when I asked what other flavors they had he stated strawberry and watermelon. I got the watermelon. Before he brought us our drinks we stopped him to ask him if he could bring out the free chips and salsa as it was 6:45 an happy hour doesn't end until 7. He stated the chips and salsa are only free in the bar for happy hour. I explained to him that i asked the hostess before we even sat down if we could get still get happy hour in the dining area and she said yes. He then asked if the bar was full and I said yes, then he said it was okay. Thennnnn our drinks come out and my drink is not a presidente, which I specifically asked for b/c I know it is on the happy hour menu from last Thursday's experience. The presidente is $5.99 & $0.50 for flavoring such as the mango & strawberry etc. I just let it go b/c I was already irritated. We order, eat & then comes the bill.....  My friends presidente margarita came out to $7.99. We told our waiter that it's on the happy hour menu, therefore it should be $6.50. He stated he was going to talk to his manager and come back to us. When he returned he apologized for not knowing the menu and stated that the presidente is nt on the happy hour menu, even though 4 days ago it was lol. Theire communication w/ one another is extremely off and I don't understand how 1 Chili's has a different happy hour menu than another chili's 20 mins away. What a FUCKING JOKE. I'll never again come to this weak ass flavorless as Chili's again in my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=160

Last night I went (the 5 star visit) and there was nothing wrong with our meal. The previous time I had been there (the 3 star visit), food and service were just A-OK. On the 5 star visit the staff was friendly and helpful. The food came out promptly and it was all perfectly done. I got the Big Mouth Bites with a side of loaded mashed potatoes. (If you're going with mashed potatoes, LOADED is the way to go...it comes with real bacon and cheese and chives instead of just a little dab of gravy) My burgers sometimes come out like charcoal, but last night they were juicy and melted in my mouth. Another person in my party got a half-rack of ribs with the standard BBQ sauce. The last time I went out and someone got ribs at Chili's, they were almost inedible, but OHMYGOODNESS these ribs were delicious.  The other person in the group got a Cobb Salad, but said it tasted like any other cobb salad.

Plus, manager man did comp everything for us.  But the scare is embedded in my brain forever.  So unless you want a pincher bug salad I wouldn't recommend eating a salad here.  Beverages yes.

Steve B.,"Grass Valley, CA",29,96,8,5.0,1/8/2007,"We got a well-intentioned Chili's gift card for Christmas and I was actually dreading going there to use it up. The Chili's I remembered from when the kids were young was greasy, bland, chilly and rude. But, like Chucky Cheese, the kids loved it, and so we went.  What a difference 10 years can make! First, the $7 Top Shelf Margaritas, mine was regular-over, the wife's was strawberry-mango. She was about to send hers back because of the salt on the rim, which turned out to be sugar which she really liked. And I really liked that it made her pleasantly tipsy. After drinking mine (delicious) I felt like I'd just drank 3 beers, it's been awhile since I felt I got my money's worth with a strong drink.  I ordered the chicken/shrimp fajitas, the wife ordered portobello/steak fajitas. Both orders came sizzling hot, everything done to perfection. Along with the chicken, I believe there were 6 jumbo prawns, very tasty, the steak juicy and tender. The beans and rice weren't really needed, but they were only .99 extra and very tasty, both.  I'd knock off a star for 2 reasons, 1) when asking for hot sauce, they came back with Tabasco, which I thought was a little weird for Southwestern-style food, I mean, they could have their own line of Chili's hot sauces, right? and 2) the otherwise delicious, very avocado-y guacamole was over-salted. But I'm putting that star back on there for our server, the best we've had in a long while. Upbeat, friendly, look-you-in-the-eye sincerity, really liking her job.

I've tried burgers, steak, fajitas, chicken tenders, fries, etc, and it's all been really good, taste, price, portion wise. But Chili's really won me over when they put an Avocado Burger on the menu - :O was literally my face because I heart Avocados. This along with my usual Mango Iced Tea really hit the spot.

Robert R.,"Concord, CA",334,736,1034,3.0,3/12/2012,"Being a former employee of Brinker, which owns Chilis; it pains me to write another previous employer review. The one I worked at was in San Jose, but I still know the Regional manager.  We went in the other day and had lunch. The Hostess and Server were very nice. We were seated right away and it was not too busy, The only thing is that our Server seemed a little flustered by being double seated. The order was standard and that it was mainly appetizers or quick fried items. We did get our Soups and salads right away, but our Server forgot to ""Un-Delay"" our Lunch items. The ""delay"" feature is used as a hold , so that you don't receive your Apps. or Salad/soup and your entree all at the same time. The only problem using that feature, is that if some one else runs out your food; it is easy to forget to ""un hold"" your order.  The Server realized her mistake and kept apologizing. She made sure were not thirsty and was Quick Draw Mcgraw with refilling our beverages. She did offer to take the Soup/salads off bill and also offer free dessert. Wifey had to get back to work and left as soon as the entrees came out. I know the Server did her best to make up for it, but I was at least expecting an apology or table visit from a Manager. So it took us from 12;30 till 2:13 to eat lunch because of the delay snafu. As I said earlier, the Server did try to make amends for the mistake. The lil' one loved the Shake we received for dessert and the food was alright. We will definite be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=200

The waitress offered them something to drink once their cups were almost empty and I was never offered a refill until I was almost done with my meal. My partner and friend laughed with me as we thought this was a ridiculous incident. We even thought the girl was being racist because we had no idea why she would not offer me a refill. My meal came with bread, which was not ready when my meal came out, and she kept forgetting to bring it. It was brought to me after countless promises but I had finished my meal already. We finished paying and she finally brought the bread. What a joke! We left her 9 cents in tip. She was lucky to get 9 cents to tell you the truth. I promised to never go back.

And,  this Chili's deserves it.   I've been to this Chili's a bunch times and never even considered Yelping about it, until tonight. First off everyone who drinks knows their drinks suck. Hell, my 12 year old twins know their drinks suck and that is why mommy never picks Chili's for dinner. We were heading to an event at our twins school tonight and decided to stop in really quick for something to eat. We had a darling waiter and I am not going to mention his name ONLY BECAUSE we were talking about the drink menu and he happened to *know* the bartender really well and the bartender hooked us up fat on our cocktails.(and he told us not to say anything)  Given that we were attending a middle school function  - we stopped at one cocktail each but let me tell you that is all we needed for a very healthy buzz.   I've never had a good cocktail at Chili's until tonight. We ordered the nacho appetizer to share and it was SO good.  My husband had some sort of jalapeno burger with bacon and the bacon was the thickest and tastiest bacon I've ever had!

My wife suggested we have lunch at Chili's since we were right across the street.  She being pregnant, the first thing I learned was that she is always right and I am always wrong.  I was happy to acquiesce so we had lunch at Chili's. Holy sliders, Batman!  That was a really yummy lunch actually.   We got 2 sodas with free refills, their Triple Dipper special, and a Fajita Quesadilla Combo, all for $26 tax included.   Katie, our waitress, was charming and friendly and did a great job with service despite that fact that they were totally packed!   And the food, while certainly not slow food, was most certainly above anything you'll find at a fast food joint.  So yeah, I'm a convert...

Unfortunatley my waitress was extremely forgetful and a little more interested in her co-workers and surroundings than her entire section.

Sarah B.,"Concord, CA",37,31,8,1.0,2/6/2012,"My sister and I went to Chili's on our lunch hour. While we were seated immediately, it took quite some time for a server to actually come to the table. While we waiting for our server, we actually watched the people behind us get up and ask a waiter for their check that was never delivered to their table, at that point I knew it was going to be a bad experience. Once our server finally came to the table, we asked to see the vegetarian menu, which we have requested and received every other time we have gone to Chili's. We were told that there was no such thing. My sister and I both tried to describe the menu to the waiter and told him that such a thing did exist. After a couple of minutes of arguing, he left our table and we assumed that he was going to at least check with someone about the vegetarian menu. My sister reminded me that the last time we went to Chili's together, we got the same waiter who  told us that they no longer had a particular item which we later found out to not be true. Several minutes passed and I checked the time, we had been there 20 minutes already and we only had 1 hour for lunch, so I looked around for our server and to my surprise, I saw him cleaning a table and chit chatting with the hostess. I tried to get his attention but was ignored and I watched him go off to another table so at that point we decided to leave.  As we walked out the door, the hostess and the girl she was busy talking to the entire time instead of helping people, watched us as we left without saying a word.

Not much, unfortunately. Which is why we got Chili's to go.  First of all, they had me on hold for almost 10 minutes. I hung up & called back & they put me on hold for another 4 minutes. OK maybe they were totally swamped since it was New Year's Day. I found out when I went to pick up my food that they weren't swamped at all, there seemed to be as many employees working as there were patrons in the restaurant. Whatever...just give me my food so I can get something in my tummy.  The food was all soggy by the time I got home so it is possible that it would have tasted better if we had eaten it at the restaurant. But somehow I kinda doubt it. The queso dip was watery...I make better queso dip with a can of chili & some cheddar cheese. The chicken ranch sandwich was pretty flavorless. Their fries are decent, I dipped 'em in ranch so they tasted pretty good.  I think I won't be eating at Chili's again unless I'm having the after-drinking munchies where I won't really care what my food tastes like.  Even then I'll be more likely to hit up McDonald's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-concord-18?start=180
