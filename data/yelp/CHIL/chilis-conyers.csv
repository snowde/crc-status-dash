Bianca W.,"Valley Center, CA",97,162,73,4.0,4/7/2009,"So, here's the thing.... Alright, Chili's isn't spectacular, I think we all know this, but the great thing about the staff at this Chili's is that they really go above and beyond in terms of customer service, most of the wait staff know that I'm a vegetarian, and though there aren't many veg friendly options, they go out of their way to make sure whatever I order is filed with extra veggies, I've never had to send anything back because it accidental came with meat. I generally opt for the veggie fajitas, as its my old standby, and its not hard to get right.  The margaritas here are insanely huge, and by huge I mean, after 1.5 margaritas you're tanked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conyers
Ellen S.,"Covington, GA",9,6,2,2.0,9/24/2011,Used to be a fun relatively quick place to eat and relax. Not sure what's happened but it is terribly slow. 40 minutes to get appetizers is ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conyers
B J.,"Hartford, CT",1,26,,3.0,12/9/2007,"Had a great salad with avocado ranch dressing (so tasty).  Great bacon cheeseburger.  I also recommend the fajitas, the southwestern egg rolls, and the shrimp Alfredo.  Waitstaff could have been more attentive, but overall good restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conyers
