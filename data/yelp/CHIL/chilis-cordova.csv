Amber M.,"Memphis, TN",79,210,34,3.0,6/3/2013,"Chilis was my go to place before and during my pregnancy. The service is hit or miss, but the food rarely disappoints. Notice I said rarely... the lackluster service can cause the food to come out incorrect or cold at times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova?start=20
Gwendolyne A.,"Bartlett, TN",0,2,3,1.0,10/5/2012,First off my unsweetened iced tea arrived very sweet the appetizers we ordered took 40 minutes to arrive and then were obviously sitting around for a while before they got to us. Seconds after our appetizers were set on the table a second waiter showed up to deliver our dinner making our table very crowded and making us feel very rushed to eat a dinner that took for ever to get started. Overall the food was just so-so.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova?start=20
Joel C.,"Cordova, TN",14,133,,3.0,7/15/2012,"Went the other day. What can you say, the food was good but nothing spectacular. Its chilis, good food and thats it. Regular restaurant service. Kind of boring actually. Had a good time but its a boring place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova?start=20
N. C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",87,705,648,4.0,9/18/2010,"Sometimes I get a hankerin' for Chili's.   I love that you can get Chili's curbside, without having to dine in when it gets kind of crazy and packed.  That's not my style.  The wait depends on the crowd, obviously, and we usually wait about 20 minutes. I enjoy their steaks on occasion with broccoli.  The steak is surprisingly good -- the broccoli is sometimes overdone, but I cut Chili's some slack.  It is what it is and overall, I enjoy it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova?start=20
Papa G.,"Cordova, TN",10,30,40,4.0,10/18/2012,"Went in for an early lunch. New and hip interior design. Food was fast, hot and better than in previous visits. Had the triple dipper and it was awesome. New menu items are a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova?start=20
Deborah D.,"Cordova/Appling, TN",26,72,,5.0,9/2/2010,"I love that my server, Lance, remembers every single thing that we like and what we don't want on our plates. I love that the manager, Chris, always takes the time to stop by to say hi and ask how we're doing. All of these things make us feel valued and not just treated like a number! ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova?start=20
Gene N.,"Cordova/Appling, TN",69,1,,4.0,7/28/2010,"Lucky to have Chili's not far from here in Cordova TN. My first Chili's experience was in Dallas in 1985 and I'm quite pleased that they've gone national. Always good flavorful stuff with a good dose of spicy if you want it. Great fajitas, salads, burgers...a lot of variety!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova?start=20
Monica P.,"Cordova, Cordova, TN",2,53,109,4.0,10/6/2017,"Good service, Our server Arkevia was very energetic and helpful with menu items. Great mango Margaritas! The food was good and hot. There should be a stylus pen to sign the kiosk. It was sticky and nasty. I had to drop a star for that because that's not sanitary at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Eric C.,"Memphis, TN",0,2,,1.0,1/7/2018,Very disappointed came here for my birthday and the so called 30% larger ribs for a whole rack it was smaller then the half rack of the regular ribs. My fries were cold when they brought the food to the table. I told my waiter about my issue he said he would got a manager but no one ever came expect another waitress telling me that's how they cut the new ribs that makes them smaller. There solution was to bring me some of the regular ribs that took so long to get everyone else at the table was done eating. I end up having to take my plate to go. Still don't know if the food was good or not. Happy Birthday to me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Andrea K.,"Memphis, TN",24,106,,3.0,10/15/2017,"Walked in around 8:15 and tons of dirty tables everywhere. Waited 5 minutes before hostess showed up to ask us how many, but then she took people behind us to their table. (?) Waited another 5 minutes before server got to table. 2for1 drafts and $5.00 queso arrived... Beer good and cold but queso was warm at best. My bacon ranch quesadillas were burnt and flavorless but Husband enjoyed his Quesadilla explosion salad. Server was sweet but kind of clueless. (Wouldn't get dirty dishes or point out the bar prices for draft beer or appetizers.) Wish I had enjoyed food as much as I enjoyed having a date with Husband.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Donna M.,"Eads, TN",231,695,8392,4.0,1/5/2017,"I like the bar & bartenders.  They always card me & make my day  Tito's Punch ~ $8.59 ~ Tito's Vodka / Malibu Coconut Rum / Sour / Pineapple Juice / Grenadine / is hand mixed & just the right sweet-sour-smooth blend.   Quesadilla Explosion Salad ~ $10.49 ~ grilled chicken breast / cheese / diced tomatoes / house-made corn & black bean salsa / tortilla chips / a drizzle of ancho-chile ranch & citrus-balsamic / served with freshly toasted 3-cheese quesadillas / is an amazing concoction ~ my favorite.   They serve a ton of Fajitas, so the dining side smells heavily of grilled onions.   Sports TVs everywhere & good for conversation if it's half full or less.  It can get loud quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Tee V.,"Cordova, TN",13,63,151,3.0,9/11/2016,"Chili's has been on my hit list since getting rid of the potato skins Lol. I hate when restaurants have a good thing going, then they change it. This particular Chili's is pretty good as far as service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Monie L.,"Cordova, TN",0,33,28,2.0,7/22/2017,Usually great dining experiences at the bar. It's 11:13p TVs being turned off  now only the main one in the bar is still on. People have been standing at the door to be seated. What is going on with the food service lately?  Bar person seems like he wants to take the food orders.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Edward H.,"Cordova, TN",211,85,383,5.0,3/9/2016,"Ordered a to-go for my wife and I and when I took the order back home 1/3 of the entire meal was missing.  Called them back up and told them that and when I told the lady - the one who took my order - of what happened she said that I could either come back to pick up the rest or she can have the manager have it ready for me another time.  I chose to go back and when I picked it up there was no apology from the manager and only an apology from the person who took my order.  I didn't expect a comp but at the very least I expected an apology from the manager.  Granted they were busy when I picked up my order but that doesn't deserve an excuse from this establishment.  Left very unhappy a ""second"" time.   3.9.16 update:   If you go, ask Gage to be your waiter!!!   It was my daughter's 4th birthday and he instantly connected since he also has a soon to be 4 yr old daughter.  He was extremely polite and sincere and came by frequently to ask if everything was ok.  My wife afterwards said that she's never had a waiter that nice before!!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova

Bobbie K.,"Cordova, TN",1,20,23,4.0,9/2/2016,"Good waitress!  Food was not hot, just warm.  But I love their chicken bacon quesadillas!  My husband had a pick three combo & his was good also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Dan Z.,"Arlington, TN",55,229,67,1.0,5/28/2016,"Still the worst of all the chili's I've ever been to.  We were there Friday night, after the dinner rush.  The first time we went here a few years ago no one waited on us for 15 minutes, so we got up and left. This time, it happened to the table behind us.  Our waiter, not checking on his tables, spent most of his time out of sight.  I had to remind him that I ordered a Coke Zero, then waited 20 more minutes for it to arrive.  It was amazing how much time he spent at his friends table and how quickly they got served once they arrived!!! My Mother-in-Law ordered cheese dip, but with a few things left out. The pan was no more than 1/4 full when they brought it out luke warm and 20 minutes after ordering it; the waiter was no help when my wife spoke up, so we took that out of his tip.  I ordered a casadilla explosion salad for  dinner. 1/4 of the casadilla was missing and the salad was bland as bland could be. The chicken had almost no taste to it.  Shame on you once, shame on me twice. This was my fault and I'll never be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Todd W.,"Cordova, TN",0,21,,5.0,10/22/2016,"100% better than the Germantown location! Corporate sent me a voucher after bad time at other location and I'm glad I checked this location out. Rachael waited on us and she was polite, patient and delightful. The fajitas came out quickly and they were pretty amazing for a franchise place. Putting this spot on my rotation for Saturday lazy day lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Julie H.,"Crestview, FL",5,42,,5.0,5/9/2015,"This visit was the best service I have ever received at this location. I was seated quickly, my order was placed with a smiling professional who seemed happy to have a job, the food came in a flash and it was cooked to perfection. Good job guys!!!  I do like paying at the kiosk on the table. No waiting on the check or waiting for your credit card to come back. Nice touch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Shonta B.,"Champaign, IL",53,5,2,5.0,12/15/2015,"My experience at Chili's today and lunch was great I walked in I was seated immediately. my server zac was awesome, the best service I've had since I returned back to Memphis I really appreciate him I didn't have to look for him for drinks I didn't have to look for him for anything he made my lunch date by myself and awesome experience.

Jeff L.,"Downtown, Seattle, WA",1,52,7,3.0,3/25/2015,"Although we're just visiting town, we have eaten at Chili's for many years. Today we stopped by for some happy hour margaritas, guacamole and chips. We sat in the bar and later ordered a couple of Oldtimers with fries. I thought I'd challenge our waitress and ask her to make mine a Terlingua Pride (a favorite from the old days in Dallas). She didn't miss a beat and knew what it was-- basically an Oldtimer with onions and chili added. The food was good, about what's expected at Chili's these days. I guess I yearn for the flavorful food from the original Chili's that we loved so much when we lived in Big D. Times and menus change, I know, but I sure loved how the chili and salsa brought a sweat out! Still have the menu from the very first Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Janne Z.,"Arlington, TN",60,60,28,2.0,5/28/2015,"This Chili's is going down hill quickly! I used to eat here all the time, but moved away, so not so often any more.  It's been a while since I've been here and BOY have they gone down hill since I was here last! The service was AWFUL.  The food was just OK.  I ordered the Steak Fajitas and though the meat was tender and pretty tender, they didn't fully cut them apart so assembling your Fajita was very cumbersome... holding a tortilla, then needing to cut up your meet more...  THEN, they bring you this cute little tower of condiments to add to the Fajita.  So cute! What did those little trees/cups cost you Chili's?  WHY not just give me more than 1 TBSP of guacamole or salsa... I'm supposed to be able to make 3 edible units, and 1 TBSP of cheese aint gonna get it!  STOP wasting your money on gimmicks and  just provide NORMAL portions.   The plates were NOT sizzling when they arrived, it was as if our waiter just forgot to bring us our food... like they were back in the kitchen chatting or something.   So, THEN there's the electronic pay method at the table... as if you don't already have enough JUNK on the table so that finding your food is getting harder and harder.  If you are looking for your fancy junk, ads, liqueur menus, and all that stuff that makes the eating surface a total of about 10 sq. inches, check the floor!  But the DOWN side of having the convenience of the electronic pay station there at your table is, after your food is delivered, you will NEVER see your server EVER again!  EVER!  They just assume you will pay and give them a tip.   CHILI'S you are just hurting yourself!  You are spending a LOT of money on crap that is not essential.  Get rid of your stupid gimmicks and fix your portion sizes.  TRAIN your wait staff the old-school way.... to take care of their clients if they expect to get a tip.  I'm going to stop giving tips if they don't wait on me. Don't believe me... just watch! For my Yelp readers... sorry, no trip to the bathroom this time, so I don't have any nasty comments about them! So sorry!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Mike W.,"Cordova, TN",13,24,188,1.0,8/3/2014,"We got to the restaurant at 8:30p.m. and there were not many people there.  We placed our orders and the food did not come out till 9:20.  We had a child's pizza, a children's cheeseburger and two Smokehouse Barbecue Cheeseburgers.  Both of the Smokehouse burgers came out with Hard, Crunchy Buns that must have served their time under a heat lamp and they were both missing the barbecue sauce.  It took forever to get our waiter back to the table.   We used to get the best service at this location but apparently not tonight!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Jen M.,"Gainesville, VA",129,302,129,4.0,5/24/2014,"I tried one of the new dishes, I think it was called the Margarita chicken bowl.  It had rice and beans and corn and chicken.  It was smaller than I thought it would be, but was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Lawana H.,"Olney, TX",0,2,6,1.0,1/2/2016,"My family and I ate here last night. It was the worst experience I have ever had at a Chili's. We asked for table side guacamole and the guy brought it and just set it on the table. I asked him if he was going to mix it all together or was I suppose to do it. He said ""well I can do it"".  My son ended up doing it instead. We never got any chips to go with it until like 30 minutes later. Or order took over a hour to get. Our drinks took forever to get, my daughter asked for a glass of water, he never brought it and we asked 4 more times.  The food was great when we got it. The service was terrible. We asked for some ranch for my grandsons salad, he never brought it. My daughter ended up going to the bar and getting it her self.  We ordered a dessert on the pad at the table. It took 45 minutes to get it and we ended up telling them we wanted it to go. And it wasn't even the dessert we ordered.  Our waiter just kept saying they are working on it.  I will not recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5,4.0,4/24/2013,"Out of all the Chili's I've been to in Memphis (granted, I have not been to them all), this one seems to offer the most consistent service. That could in part be because I go to this one the most. The food on the menu has a definite focus on punching up the flavour compared to similar things you'd get elsewhere. But it might just be me, I've found that since they've started tinkering with their menu, they've ended up removing a lot of variety from their menu. I like Chili's but I can't come here too often, or I end up getting sick of the food I do like there. They have a new sandwich, the grilled chicken and guacamole sandwich (take off the guacamole and mayonnaise and it's perfect) that's good and what's really neat is you get a half portion on the lunch menu or a full sandwich for dinner. What can be really annoying is the waiters' tendency to refill your drinks without asking. It always seems to happen right after I've taken a bite of my food, too. I go to grab my drink and oh, they've poured more unsweetened tea in my cup (and the pitcher never has ice in it), completely messing up the ratios of tea-lemon-sweetener, and most importantly, ice (it is called ICED tea, after all). At least ask if I want a refill before deciding I need another two ounces of tea. There's one waitress in particular who does always ask and is automatically my favourite because of that. Yes, it is a big deal for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
Chealsy L.,"Memphis, TN",15,90,59,3.0,11/28/2014,"As usual chili's always seems to have partner servers I don't know why but, whatever. My first server was incompetent to say the least I'd like to assume she was new. The other server was actually good but, sadly his waiting abilities were ruined by the horrid bartender. I ordered a pomegranate martini after asking if they had the ingredients necessary. It is a really easy drink after all. Well this bartender decided instead of saying he couldn't make the drink or asking how to make the drink he would just wing it. The first one came out with olives I then asked if the bartender could make this drink and if not I'd be happy to order something else. I was reassured he could so I said OK. Finally get the drink it has a lemon instead of a like whatever no big deal I take a sip and almost lost the food I had just eaten. Instead of a sweet smooth pomegranate martini I instead received an extra dirty martini with grenadine in it to give it the pinkish hue. It was disgusting! Especially after offering to order something else this was ridiculous! I was then given two margaritas which isn't nearly the same but, the manager waived them so again no big deal. That's why they are getting 3 stars they aren't the worst in town but, not 5 star worthy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cordova
