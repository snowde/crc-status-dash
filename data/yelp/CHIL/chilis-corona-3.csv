Ema V.,"Fullerton, CA",43,124,72,3.0,7/18/2017,"Came here with my girlfriends for our weekly dinner. I wouldn't normally pick Chili's for a restaurant but none of us could make our minds so someone made the decision for us. We got here right around 5:30pm, not to many people there yet for dinner. I completely forgot about our servers name but he was good! Service was great. Took our drink orders and they were always full. We were able to order our food right away. 2 of us ordered entree from their 2 for $22 menu which was nice so we basically got a free appetizer. I ordered the 6oz sirloin which came with loaded mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. It wasn't the best steak I have ever had but it wasn't the worst. Although we had a pleasant experience I don't think I would come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3
Abigaile H.,"Chino, CA",4,4,16,1.0,10/24/2017,I ordered a Santa Fe crispers salad just a few minutes ago and look what I've got? A big stem and no avocado slices. They come with avocado slices right? I put the stem on top so you can see it clearly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3
Rebecca D.,"Corona, CA",0,11,,5.0,1/7/2018,"Some of the reviews on here are laughable. I've been coming to this chili's for YEARS & they are by far the best! There's hardly ever a wait time, they always say 15-20 minutes but I never feel like it really takes that long. Chips & salsa are BOMB. white spinach queso BOMB. nachos super bomb. The servers are always super nice & very attentive. I love the loaded boneless wings (I ask for extra cheese though) because some of the cooks do leave some stuff kinda dry. This is my favorite restraunt and the prices are reasonable! If you want great service & good food this is the place to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3
Dany C.,"Riverside, CA",5,103,386,2.0,12/20/2017,"Came in for lunch at 2. Cruz was my waitress. Received a slightly cold burger and cold wings. I said I wanted to keep my burger and not wait for the remake. Remade the wings and comped the cold ones and the hot ones. She made a big deal about comping something other than the one set of wings which totaled to cover the cost of the hot set of wings. I ordered an iced tea and she did not refill it once. I asked for mayo and each after receiving my slightly cold Burger almost five minutes after I got it when she stop by. She brought the ranch. Another few minutes later I ate my burger with a soggy bun. No discount on the burger. Tipped $2.50, slightly under 15% to show my frustration",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3

Miguel V.,"Riverside, CA",2,4,,1.0,1/4/2018,"2nd time in a row now with bad service at this chili's. This is the worst chili's I've been to. Their service is terrible! Long wait times to get a server to take the order and even longer for the food to arrive once the server takes our order. I can see why if they're busy but we went on a non peak time, and the restaurant was pretty empty. our server never gave us updates or reassure us that our food was on the way. We asked for a straw and never got one, not asking for much just a straw...... This last time, we had to walk out because we got so tired of waiting for our food. The food is not all that great to be worth the wait. I don't ever plan on coming back to this chili's if I can help it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3
Cindy L.,"Corona, CA",0,1,4,1.0,11/20/2017,"I took my family to dine at Chili's. Chilies used to be good don't know what happened, but the server was terrible bad attitude and the food was horrible and to make matters worse the manager brought it out and if he didn't see anything wrong with it that says a lot about their management and their kitchen. The food looked like it was microwavable.. The mini burgers were so dry and hard to bite, the pasta with chicken had no flavor and the salad some of the items looked like they were already decomposing and my enchilada platter well the rice looked and tasted four days old the beans dry flavorless probably because of the microwave. I regret taking my family. Not going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3

Kaitlin S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,19,,2.0,12/29/2017,"Giving them two stars is VERY generous. I don't remember our waitresses name (for obvious reasons). We went in for Veterans Day with my husband who had just retired from the USMC and our waitress was high as a kite. Her excuse was that she was called in early. She didn't write down our order and brought us the wrong food and drinks numerous times. My husband ordered a beer and drank half of it. She proceeded to tell him he had ""better drink that G** damn beer"", in front of my very religious father, who had been very tolerant thus far. Lucky enough, the manager offered us a whole 15% off of our bill and some coupons for our ""next visit"". Not happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3
Matt G.,"Riverside, CA",206,352,1086,3.0,7/9/2016,Chili's used to be my favorite restaurant a few years ago but has fallen off mostly due to menu changes and policies.  I still am a big fan of the Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers.  I love that honey chipotle sauce! I was a fan of the big mouth burgers with the extra thick cut bacon.  I see that they are making attempts to get some appealing burgers back on the menu but the extra thick cut bacon is missing.  I used to order ribs al-a-carte but they stopped allowing that years ago.  It was nice to add some ribs to pair with a steak.   Chili's French Fries are better than most but they give much less than they used to.  On my last visit there were only two servers working in the restaurant late in the evening.  My server fell behind but did a good job considering the lack of staff.  I still come to Chili's but not near as often as I used to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3

Karen P.,"Santa Ana, CA",8,5,2,1.0,9/25/2017,"Worst service ever. The hostess were lost took them an hour and a half to seat us. I know we are a large party (21) but we had mentioned like 3 times we could be split up. Party's of 4 and 5 were sat before us although again we could be split up. The hostess was more worried about disrupting the servers sections then accommodating us. After waiting to be sat for an hour and a half only one server was serving us. All appetizer orders were given to the wrong people no drinks on one side of table then when they checked on what they had dropped off they said the kitchen was backed up. I asked 3 times for chips and salsa what does the kitchen have to do with chips and salsa? When they finally brought them they added ""they were given to the other side of the table"" well that's great to tell your customer. Appetizers came out 5 min before our food (no room for both on table). My sisters onion rings were burned. Why would they serve burned food?!?!? Also I tried flagging the manager but he kept ignoring me. I knew he seen me but chose to ignore me instead. I am never going back to this chilies. They advertise to come with your party and have a good time but can't accommodate a birthday party. They could've had to serves help us but that would disturb the servers sections I guess they decided it wasn't worth it. We were very patient and even then our food was wrong and took forever to get to the table. The server was doing the best he could but management should have stepped in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3
Steve N.,"Corona, CA",94,43,7,5.0,7/6/2017,"So I spend $30 for a 14z rib eye at Wood Ranch on the fourth and am horribly disappointed (not 14z and charred). Next day I try Chilis and order the rib eye. Said to be 11-14z, but at only $18 with 2 excellent sides. The steak was thick so as to be cooked med rare. The steak was quality and not charred. This is a great value and another hit by this Chilis. Not sure what they have done in the past but they are one of the best chain restaurants in the City. The service was excellent (Marin) but their corporate people need to bring back buss staff. Let your servers do their job and focus on us the customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3

Then my meal wasn't right so they took it back and kinda took forever. I talked to a manager and Eric did more than help me out. He had great customer service and just made the whole experience a lot better! A lot of the things wrong we're out of his hands, yet he went out of his way to help us out and totally exceeded our expectations. Thank you Eric!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3

He's the best waiter and is always attentive and always make sure my drink is refilled, he makes sure everyone is happy and always has their food! 12/10 for mike. HOWEVERR, today I went and got a different waiter, David. He wasn't as attentive, didn't refill our drinks, and probably only showed up 3 times the whole time we were eating. He didn't even feel bad when I told him he forgot my mashed potatoes, and only apologized after the manager was informed. However I'm still giving it 5/5 because my boy mike always kills it.

Britney M.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",217,625,1058,5.0,2/16/2015,"GET IN MY BELLY!  Chili's is one of my all time favorite places to eat. They have the yummiest chips and salsa for surper cheap. Grub outttttttttttttttt since its unlimited  Texas cheese fries are a good small bite if you aren't hungry for a full on meal, or one of their salads would do. But my all time favorite favorite favorite dish, is the Cajun Chicken Pasta. I order this with the chicken on the side, then add broccoli, and lastly add grilled shrimp. And let me say, this creation is Divine!!!!!!!! The type of Alfredo sauce that they use has such a great flavor, and I could have seriously licked my bowl when I finished my pasta. The broccoli was steamed perfectly, and tasted amazing when dipped into the Alfredo sauce. The shrimp was grilled, and seasoned to my satisfaction. The fresh tomatoes on top- that was the icing on the cake! Sooooo happy, like many times before.  One complaint about our visit today though, our Cajun pastas both came with burnt bread. Like it was black looking and when you bit into it, you wanted to spit it right back out because it even tasted burnt. We were sad about that because usually the bread is so yummy! Will come back for my Cajun chicken pasta",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3?start=40
Juliet E.,"Menifee, CA",354,98,6,4.0,3/4/2017,"I came here with my friend and we overall enjoyed our experience. We had a great server but I felt bad because he was the only one on the floor and he had a lot of tables. Management needs to work on making sure they staff the dinner shifts properly. Other than that, our food tasted awesome and we had good service. I recommend the Texas cheese fries as an appetizer.

Jenny E.,"Riverside, CA",0,4,4,4.0,8/15/2017,The restaurant was clean and we got seated quickly for a Friday afternoon.

Marisa Q.,"Riverside, CA",5,34,7,2.0,5/7/2016,"I was very surprise to enjoy our lunch here. I got the turkey sandwich and I loved it so that's 1 star. The service was good, nothing to complain about. The reason for the low rating is that when we walked it no one greeted us because no one was in the front. It seems like they were under staffed. Not sure if it was on purpose because there either slow or the company is that greedy they want to save labor hours. We were waiting a good while like 3-5 minutes just standing there being ignored. Once we were seated once again I noticed they had very few servers. Making it seem like they were short staffed. This is the second time I've noticed this and it's a bad move. Not only am I hesitant to ask my server for something, but when I did ask for something it took a while for her to get it because she had so many tables. The bad thing about this is that it made us feel like just another tip, instead of being able to interact with the guest and create a friendly atmosphere. Instead it felt rushed and tensed. I hope they can work on this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3?start=40

When we were finally seated, our waiter Robert took our drink order then our food order at 8:20. We waited, and waited, and waited for our food to come. We waited a total of 50 minutes for our food. Robert never once came by to check if we needed anything or give us updates. Instead, i saw him sitting in a booth talking to a coworker. I finally had to get up myself and ask to speak to the manager to get an update on our food. When our food finally came, our drinks were watered down and my daughter's lemonade was completely empty. In the total of 2 hours that we were here, Robert still didn't once come by to ask if we needed anything, not even a refill. However, the manager was friendly and apologetic.

Another person in my party had a salad and said it was awful. We had the chips and guacamole and the chips were oily skinny and all stuck together. They have that iPad looking thing where you can order. You would think they would baby wipe it or something after each customer. The thing was disgusting.

Serrano S.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",3,46,75,2.0,4/2/2017,"So... we decided to stop at this chilli's to celebrate our daughters 15th birthday.... it was a BAD idea! First off, let me just say our waiter was friendly(why I gave two stars) we were seated after waiting about 30 minutes(we are a family of 6) so I thought... well not that bad... our waiter took our drink order... I told him we were doing the two for $35 dinner and a two for $22 dinner so I wanted to place the order for our appetizers (which I then did) we got our drinks in about 10 minutes... our appetizers took about 20 minutes... and our waiter was no where in site to take our food order... I honestly don't know how long it was... but let's just say... we had finished our appetizers and already needed drink refills before he came and took our dinner orders. When we placed our order... he then said ""I punched in your order already so it got sent to the back... I don't know when it will be out... but it will be out"" and he left to wait on the other many many many tables he was assigned to!!! Our food took very long to come out... within the time waiting for it... I had to flag down many other employees (which all rushed past our table and seemed not to have noticed me while I raised my hand and yelled excuse me!) I finally got one waiters attention... and we even asked what was going on... he then replied ""we have a new system which means us waiters basically do less.. we just take your orders and now we have food bussers that bring out the food to you... us waiters got more tables to cover now since we don't have to bring out the food any more... but all orders must be placed with your waiter"" so I then told him... well I don't see our waiter to place our refill drink orders and I also haven't received my house salad which I placed that order over 25 minutes ago!! So he then said he'd get it all for us... right when our waiter magically appeared!!! How convenient!! I got my salad right away after speaking to both waiters along with our refills... so... when our food finally came... 3 food bussers came and handed out plates all in a rush and rushed off before we could even say a word!!! Again our waiter was no where to be found!!! And every employee (food bussers and waiters) that past our table had me waving and yelling excuse me... as they all rushed by and some how couldn't hear nor see me!!! It was about 35 minutes... when I decided to stand up and was gonna walk to the kitchen!!! Right when a female food busser sees me and that's when I tell her in my frustrated voice that my food is now ice cold cause it had been sitting there for over 30 minutes under an ac that was aiming right at our table... I couldn't eat my food nor my kids had eaten theirs since we had no ranch for their chicken strips or fries... my husband and I had no A1 sauce or Tabasco sauce for our steaks... and no butter for our broccoli!!! She said she'd bring it out... she did within 10 minutes... I cut into my steak and guess what??!!! It was well done when I ordered medium!!! My husbands was rare when he ordered medium!!! I was done at that point... and I know our waiter noticed... because when he magically appeared to take our dessert order that came with our $35 meal...he asked if we were ok... I know I looked pissed... my husband gave me his look like don't ruin our daughters birthday dinner ... so I said we are ok!!! He brought us boxes and our dessert within 10 minutes and we seemed to see him a lot right before we left... wish it would of been that way the entire time!!! We didn't even get to let them know it was our daughters 15th birthday!!! I'm so upset and disappointed! We are Hispanic... a girls 15th birthday is suppose to be special... and this was horrible!!! It was a train wreck! I'm so disappointed with this establishment ... I think we would of gotten better service and hotter food at Denny's at this point! $102 we spent... $102 on cold food... that wasn't how  we ordered!!! What a way to ruin a girls 15 birthday!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3?start=40

Our waiter was kind and attentive....and I want to make sure that it is known that he was great. It was the food at the end of the day that left much to be desired. Then it got super busy....we know because he told us. He was still kind and attentive but a few other things occurred. My daughter found a screw....like a 1/2 inch full screw at the bottom of the basket of chips. Quite alarming!! The kids food came out pretty decent. Our fajitas came out undercooked. The shrimp was fine but the veggies were still raw....didn't send back because at this point I just wanted to be done. A different waitress brought out the kids Sprite refills, stood at the end of the table and said, ""You have Sprites??"" I said yes the three kids at the end...she set all of them down at the far end (full size mugs without kids) of the table and just left them there. Didn't hand them out so the kids had to get up and hand them out themselves. I get you're busy....but come on!! Thank goodness for the mango margarita is all I have to say.

Then she only took one appetizer order left put it in then ignored us then came back kept ignoring us the finally came back room one order again and left instead of AGAIN taking all seven orders.!

My beer came to the table about 20 minutes after I ordered it and can you say warm beer that was only 70% full. Then are meals came and we ordered 2 loaded mashed well both plates came out with regular. Are server came to the table once. And are fries we're cold.

I prefer don Jose's nachos better although it costs twice as much. These ones came in about 7pieces and it looked more like tiny slices of pizzas. Thick and filled with cheese, jalapeños sprinkled on top. MANGO MARGARITA 4/5  I love this drink !!! Its filled with fruity citrus flavors and the handle the size of 16oz beers. I was impressed with the flavor really, it had a good amount of alcohol in for the mix.  SERVICE 5/5 Our server was superb and cute. He was very humorous even when it was late and he was tired he still came by very often to check in on his. Constantly making sure we had everything we needed and making us comfortable.

The second time we were completely ignored along with three other tables around us. My daughter got her kid's quesadilla first and after 30 minutes we had to go to the front of the restaurant and ask the manager if the rest of our food was going to come and when it did it was cold.

Not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but this one is running its parent company's business model to a T.  I even had an issue with a urinal that was resolved immediately.  Well run, friendly people, and especially good for happy hour prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3?start=80

Terri B.,"Corona, CA",0,21,47,3.0,2/25/2014,"We have been coming to this Chili's since they first opened.  Unfortunately our experiences here, lately, have not been stellar. We were there this past Sunday-arriving just after 5:30 or so. We were quoted about a 20 minute wait and it was actually a little less. Great start, right? We were a party of 5. 3 women 2 in their 50's and 1 in her 70's, 14 y/o girl and 5 y/o boy.  After we were seated we noticed that the temp in the room was pretty cold-colder than outside. This does tend to be the norm in Corona-I jokingly say I am going to start bringing a blanket when we go out!  After we placed our order I mentioned the temp to our server and she said she would check into it. A few minutes later, the manager, Jeff, stopped by our table.  He was very personable and explained that the air wasn't on, it was just the fan. However as we were talking the air from the vent (right over our table) seemed less cold. He said he would check to make sure the air wasn't on on and I think he most have because after that the temp was fine. We ordered 2 of the $20 dinners for the 4 adults/teens and the small one ordered pizza.  Chips and guacamole and fried cheese were our appetizers. My sister noted the time we ordered since we have had problems with long delays here in teh past (my last visit our food was served late and cold and we didn't get any silverware-really!-that meal was a complete comp!) Chips, salsa and guacamole and cheese came pretty quick along with beverages. Chips, salsa, and guacamole were good as always! Fried cheese was just okay-should have been hotter. We were done eating our appies and thought too much time had gone by-sure enough when we checked it had been about 30 minutes. Our server stopped by to say that our food would be up soon and we asked to speak to manager, Jeff. She said they were waiting on my fajitas.   Food arrived in about another 5 minutes. Well, most of it. 2 burgers, ribs and pizza came. Pizza was hot. Burgers and ribs were not. Burgers we way over cooked.  My mom ordered mashed and got fries. Server brought her the mashed pretty quickly and they were nice and hot.   My chicken fajitas came in a few more minutes-sizzlilng hot plate.  I noticed that the chicken looked different from the last time I ordered (I think it was Nov. 2013). The chicken was blonde-no grill marks. Looked like it had been poached. Onions were slightly burnt but that is normal with fajitas. Jeff arrived a few minutes later and listened to our complaints and explained a few things. Chicken different-yes, Chili's has gotten rid of their grills. WOW! Due to carbon footprint.  Pizzas and fajitas are made at the enchilada station. That caused their delay. Other food was ready and sat while waiting on rest. That is not how server is supposed to handle it.  Also, he agreed that the 5 y/o's (very antsy) pizza should have been brought out asap.Also, the server may not have put our order in right away. He checked the ticket when we asked to see him and it had been stamped about 20 minutes earlier. We let him know it had been about 30.  Jeff, again, was very personable, and gracious!  He was awesome! He said he is working on making changes at this location. He took some of the food off the bill.  We did tip the waitress, though definitely not 15%. She failed to get our food out hot and she never asked if we wanted a refill on chips. We will be back to this location, but we will continue to keep track of food delivery time. We do like the food at Chili's though I am concerned over the changes in how they are prepping some of their food.

This is our 3rd or 4th time in since it opened some years ago, and every time we come, we leave feeling the same. Disappointed in the food, and a little sorry for the kids that have to sever it. the service was great. The hostess, servers, and busboy were all friendly, professional and attentive. As on other visits, the failure is in the food. it's a combination of bad recipes and poor execution. I got the 3 tacos combo special, and my wife got 2 chicken tacos. The Sprog got a plate of fries and shared with us. I got one fish, one chicken and one Carnitas. The fish was really fishy, just not good or fresh. The chicken and carnitas were better, but tasted like smoke flavoring and salt. The cabbage was the best thing on any of the tacos. The rice and beans were good, but not anything special. My wife's two chicken tacos were also just OK, but kinda wilted and plopped on the plate like no one gave a crap. Overall none of it is ever really bad, it's just never close to good.  I'm sure I'll forget this review in a few years, have another crappy meal, and then realize I should have known better. The boy got his new fish at petco, named him Ron.

Steven C.,"Corona, CA",0,21,2,3.0,2/23/2015,"I would like to start off by saying I have worked in food service, and we were 'that' table. 13 people, 7 of which were kids. We also had coupons. Yeah, ouch. Our server, who I cannot remember the name of, was PHENOMENAL!! Drinks were never empty, she accommodated our difficult coupon situation, and she was flat out amazing with the kids. Could not ask for better service. Whoa, only three stars? Yeah we hooked her up on the tip and if Chili's is reading this, and has any kind of employee rewards based on Yelp reviews, please know that this rating in no way reflects the awesomeness of the server!! The food took well over 30 minutes. When it arrived, it was okay at best. I ordered a guacamole burger. It had way too many jalapenos and was luke-warm. Also, of the 12 plates (two littles shared)  that were brought to the table only 4 were right. 3 of the  7 kids received only entrees and no sides or vice versa. I upgraded to the sweet potato fries and received regular fries. My wife received no ranch. All three burgers at the table were entirely too greasy. We were less than satisfied.  Now for a little food service trick...a lot of people would attribute at least a few of these problems to the server. I, however, did not say anything until the bills were presented. EVERYTHING we ordered on the bill was 100% CORRECT. Absolutely no fault to the delightful server. This Chili's needs to pay more attention to detail on the back of the house. The food took forever, and then it was mostly wrong. Every star earned on this rating came from the overall experience and not the quality or accuracy of the food. We also noticed no managers on the floor. I expected to see some sort of quality control in the front of the house since there was clearly none in the back. Luckily, the servers and host staff have everything pretty much down all by themselves. We will return, thanks in small part to the server.

Jason P.,"Corona, CA",35,44,6,3.0,1/8/2014,"As with most Chili's restaurants, this location can usually be counted on for decent food and an inviting atmosphere.    I find myself going for a bit of both.  Although it is boring to me to review large, chain establishments, I have been dining at this particular one for over a decade.  That said, I feel this particular restaurant deserves an honest review.  So Jason, you have been eating there for a decade...why only 3-stars then?  Well, because its Chile's...just Chile's...no more, no less, and the corporate philosophy of order and efficiency in the name of the almighty dollar implores all Chile's to be the same.  This one is in a nice place, in a nice area, and over ten years, I still enjoy coming here. The Atmosphere: FUN! This Chile's has a nice bar area that just invites feelings of laid back comfort and fun.  It is a rectangle shaped bar where you can enjoy a good game on the big screen or people watching...Which can be WAY more fun by the way.  The bar is open with a nice color scheme and lots of windows allowing a good amount of light during the day.  Not a dim, dive bar here.  The one problem I have is that this restaurant gets so packed, it can be difficult to find room to stand, let alone sit and order a beer.  One thing I don't like is that the bar becomes a defacto waiting area and if you happen to be sitting at a table close to the lobby it can be annoying.  The Food: I must say, I enjoy their new menu and selections.  From steaks to seafood, Chile's has a bit of everything.  I enjoy their appetizers and appetizer combinations.  Their steaks are tasty and their new garlic butter steak was VERY good.  I am a big fan of their tortilla soup and nachos as well.  Their new menu is inspiring and I found myself wanting to go back to try some of the other new items I saw.  I do feel the desserts look better on the menu than they taste in reality, but hey, they still taste good.  The Service: In ten years, I have NEVER had bad service here.  As I stated before, this location can get packed, but they handle it well.  The bartenders are attentive as is the wait staff.   Overall Chile's is Chile's...One thing that frequenting this restaurant over a decade has taught me that I think I should mention however....  Since 2008, the prices have stealthily crept higher and the portions have been made ever so smaller.  You almost wouldn't notice it, unless you come about once a month like I do.  This past weekend was the most glaring example of it.  Yes, the garlic butter steak was delicious, but what they said was 6 oz was barely over 3.  And no, cooking is not responsible for a 50 percent reduction in size.   It is obvious that Chile's is trying to become as profitable as possible....There is nothing wrong with that....But now, I am starting to notice it.  As long as the food is good, I will probably keep coming back, but I can see a time when I might think twice.   Anyway....TRY THE VEAL!  Just kidding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3?start=100

Richard B.,"Corona, CA",25,23,6,1.0,2/22/2013,"Went on Wednesday for my neighbor's birthday dinner.  We arrived at around 7:20pm and was informed that it would be a 25-30 minute wait.  Needless to say we decided to wait in the bar and have a drink while our table was prepared.  Aftewr ordering a beer and an iced tea, the bartneder informed of it would be a moment as they have no clean glasses to serve at the moment.  Looking around I found the area under the tv on the right side of the bar to be covered in dirty glasses and dishes.  When the rest of our party arrived, I looked around and found most of the tables were not being bussed by anyone.  After about 25 minutes we finally got our table which was cleared by the hostess.    We ordered our drinks and food.  It took an hour for 6 people to get their food.  One of the people ordered potatoe skins with sliders, and texas egg roll.  the egg roll was soggy, the sliders buns were hard, and the potatoe skins were actually limp.  either they microwaved the food or it sat under the heating lamp for an hour.  Some of our party got their food incorrectly, and most of the food was served cold.  after speaking to the manager about the issues with our food and the overall hygeine of the restaurant he decided to comp us our food.  Needless to say none of the tables around us were cleaned until we made an issue about it with management, with several tables having left over food and dirty dishes on them for over an hour.  I actually watched them move the dishes from one table to another just to make room for some guests.  the bathrroms were disgusting and the floor in the server prep area was covered in food and grease.   Needless to say that since they are willing to leave their dining room in the sort of breeding ground for food born illness and serve food that would not even pass as credible at any prison i will not be back to visit this location. I have forwarded the pictures and the complaint with the health department.  the amount of bacteria and potential virisus that were left out for not only myself but small children to get hold of was horrible.   I hope they clean up there act but based on this visit I can not even give them a second chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3?start=100

Meanwhile my son is starving because he needs his ranch to eat. My husband notice our waitress chatting it up with another waitress for 10 minutes.  Now I'm fuming, so we asked a different waiter to bring ranch. Finally!!! She brings our ranch after he goes back and tells her.  She didn't even apologize for taking so long, then had the nerve to ask if we wanted sour cream and guacamole for the second time. After, she asked if we wanted dessert but we said no because my husband told her it was my son's birthday and she was already suppose to bring out something. So what happens? Well, she comes back and thanks us for coming in and tells us if we changed our mind about dessert we can still order one on the tablet at our table.

They've got a 2 meals for $20 =D So far so good, we look forward to returning every now and then.  The service is eh...depends on who you have.  However, overall we're satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3?start=120

We locked eyes with over 10 employees. One girl was off her shift and came up to the podium and ignored us! Really? You can't say someone will be right with you? We we're intentionally ignored most likely I thought so we would sit in the bar area. Well, it's 9 and they didn't close till 11! I didn't want to sit in the bar we were celebrating a birthday! A tall man with grey hair finally came over no apology just a blunt do you wanna sit in the bar for happy hour? We said no thank you. He rolled his eyes and turned his back to us and then turned back around with a irritated look and said well there gonna have to clean off a table for you. As there were tons of empty booths and tables. We said that's fine and he said unless you can just sit in the bar there are booths and tables and its the same service... Ummm no it isn't! The bar is loud,  people are drinking and its a social area with t.v. and drunk people! We already said we wanted to sit on the regular side! We decided to tell the guy no, we will just go next door to Macaroni  Grill. We went over to Mac Grill and we were greeted and seated with no huffs and puffs.

M B.,"Norco, CA",2,15,,2.0,1/22/2014,"My husband, our 4 month old son, and I attempted to eat at this Chili's tonight. We were seated by a host (didn't catch his name but he had large plugs in his earlobes hiding his gauged ears - he was very professional, got us a sling for our baby, and sat us immediately - kudos to him, he's the only reason I didn't give this place one star).  The issue was that after we were sat, we waited in our booth for 12-15 minutes without so much as a greeting from any server. Several servers passed by us (one in particular to drop off food to a table next to us, another who took orders for a table of 8 sitting across from us, and a third who asked the table on the OTHER side of us if their party was doing okay), but not one of them took any notice to the fact that we were sitting there. A simple, ""Hi, I'm so-and-so, I'll be your server tonight, I'll be right back"" or ""Hi, your server will be right with you"" would have made a BIG difference.  Also, the entire time we were sitting there, the MANAGER was chatting with the table of 8 about traveling outside the country. I sincerely hope she enjoys her trip to Guatemala.  My husband and I have both worked in several restaurants as servers, and the average required greet time runs at about 2-3 minutes... not 12-15. We left, advising the host, previously mentioned, why we were leaving. I love Chili's and have never waited that long for a greet.

We had three kids at our large table so we were using 3 on the little electronic games (2 were in use) and he came right over and took the one my daughter was using. We said why can't he take the one no one is using? He said that one belongs to the other table and marched off with it. Did it matter? I didn't even grab it off the table he took it to. And we grabbed a third because the other one that was suppose to be at our table was in the window behind us broken. Anyway, we had three different tabs and we were leaving tips which we already thought he didn't deserve when he grabbed the other electronic game from my nephew and then the one in the window saying how it was all broken.

Gabe W.,"Corona, CA",36,9,13,1.0,9/10/2013,"My family and I have come here often, and in the last three visits, the service has gotten worse and worse. Last night, we went at around 6:30 and there weren't too many people there so we were expecting the service to be a bit quicker than it was. We ordered our drinks, appetizers and main dishes the first time our waitress came around. The drinks came with good time, the appetizers took a bit long but the main dishes took almost 45 min to come out. And the only reason it did come out was because we told the manager we wanted to pay for what we HAD gotten and leave. When the food arrived, it wasn't hot and we received no apologies from our waitress or the manager. When it was time to pay the check, it took another 20 min before anyone came along. Now I don't expect free things, but in my own experience working in customer service and bad experiences at other restaurants, some sort of compensation is usually offered following terrible service like this. But of course, we saw no such thing. Aside from the service, other problems we came across were hygienic such as a dirty table, dead insects along the window next to the table and chewing gum literally hanging from the bottom of the table.

I ordered chicken strips with fries and although they were good and the waitress was extremely nice and very attentive, I just didn't like the idea of having to pay $8 for some chicken strips.  At home, you don't get three different dipping sauces to go with your homemade strips, but you're getting way more strips for your money.  Sure, what's 8 bucks when you're saving time and effort?  But every cheap bastard knows that you shouldn't have to pay that much for something so simple. There's nothing extraordinary about this particular Chili's so if you're a fan, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  But if you're a cheap bastard like me, you'd better order something you can't make at home.  Otherwise, you're gonna feel like I feel and wonder if you should have ordered something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corona-3?start=140
