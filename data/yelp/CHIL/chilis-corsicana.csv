Brian J.,"Houston, TX",76,16,1,1.0,8/13/2014,"Stopped in today against my better judgement after a previous trip from Dallas to Houston. Once again, the ribeye ordered med rare was delivered well done and the other entree was completely wrong item.  This was the last time. Next time, we'll just eat at McDonald's.  Crappy food but at least we know what to expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Shaun K.,"Overland Park, KS",0,26,,1.0,5/13/2015,"Wednesday May 13, 530pm.  great service, seated quick, attentive server.   Could have gotten a better meal at Mcdonalds or Wendys.  My ""grilled"" chicken sandwich was clearly ""over microwaved frozen ckn patty"" ckn sandwich.   was more like dried jerky.   Everything was sticky, chairs, menu and mens room door.   Gross!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Peter G.,"Kingwood, Houston, TX",1,26,12,1.0,9/20/2013,Please don't go. Foods had a metallic tast. Yuck AWEFUL have you ever had to return chips and salsa!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Joey P.,"Dallas, TX",246,15,28,2.0,9/6/2014,"1st of all I was gonna buy a drink, but, there were no prices on then menu and our waitress had no idea of the cost, lol.  I went ahead and ordered blindly for a frozen margarita, my lady stuck with water.  I ordered the standard chicken Sandwhich, which was exactly that.  My lady ordered a six ounce sorlon with broccoli, it arrived looking like a two ounce ground beef patty and the broccoli was so soft it was in edible, yuck.  The manager was sent over due to our questioning of the drink price, two ounces of six ounce steak and mushy broccoli.  We couldn't complain about the steak, due to the three bites and it was gone, but the broccoli was a do over.  The repeat broccoli was the exact same.  We gave up, paid out bill and headed out.  You have been review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Mike F.,"Corsicana, TX",9,64,13,1.0,1/9/2015,"Food was alright, but my major problem i have with them is that the beer there is probably the ""warmest beer in navarro county"" i love draft beers, but i just wont ever order a beer there again due to the beer temperature. And this isn't the first time. They have good margaritas but DONT order a draft beer unless you don't like them cold. I will have to say that a new restaurant in town under the bridge is probably the coldest in town. It had ice in it. Me and my wife's favorite food is the texas cheese fries",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Crystal M.,"Katy, TX",1,1,,1.0,7/5/2014,"The service was beyond terrible. We got our food at the same time as our appetizer. When we ask to return the appetizer and not pay for it the server would argue and just walked off leaving our food on the tray not even serving us. We talked to one of the managers and she was just pretending to listen. Our server ignored us the rest of our time there and accused my father of cursing at her when he told her to take the appetizer back, which was a lie. She argued again claiming that he cursed then walked away throwing her hands up. All we wanted was an apology for her behavior and she couldn't even give us that. Horrible service. Never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Rita H.,"Knoxville, TN",24,19,3,4.0,3/9/2014,Amazing food & excellent service!  I don't know if Chili's is doing something different but their food has improved so much.  Lately I've been getting a different dish each visit & I'm never disappointed!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Vishu A.,"Allen, TX",0,2,1,1.0,7/2/2015,"Service extremely slow, took 25 mins to get drinks, 45 minutes to get appetizer, more than an hour for main course, unless you have plenty of time to kill, avoid this place. Food was Ok",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Mj T.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/19/2014,"Not a good experience : stopped here for lunch on the way to Dallas and ordered the chicken enchilada soup, they bought me the soup without the tortilla chips, they said it finished. I would have expected them to come and explain this before serving the incomplete dish. Then ordered some fajitas which came and were pretty much raw. Had them returned to get them we'll done. Those came back with a lot of oil",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Sara C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,3,,1.0,2/24/2012,"Worst restaurant experience in years.  Nice people, no idea how to run a restaurant.  Food subpar for Chilies.  They forgot appetizer, never offered refills. Burger, potatoes were lukewarm at best.  Even chicken fingers looked pitiful.  Bathroom changing table blocked access to sink,  really!?  If passing through avoid this, and hold out for something closer to civilization.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Tabbey E.,"Dawson, TX",0,6,,1.0,12/26/2014,"I'm all about the service! The male host was lazy,rude and partial to certain parties! And they were not Families with small children. By passed us and another couple with a small child.he was leaning on the podium when I came in and looked at me without saying a word, like what the hell do you want! Had words with him several times had to get the Manager involved. Although she tried to be accommodating by giving us a free appetizer, the damage was done. Our waitress Jean was also very accommodating . Left her a nice tip.We live near Corsicana and have only been to this Chilis a handful of times because the service is always terrible in one form or another. The food is so so. They get one star from me. I personally will not be returning . Would not have went this trip , but received gift cards for Christmas. What a waste of my Families hard earned money. I'm not in a habit of paying people to be rude to me. My advice , steer clear of this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
April E.,"Houston, TX",65,21,,1.0,12/25/2012,"TERRIBLE!!!! Don't stop....keep driving! Thinking this was a safe bet for the 10 of us, we stopped on the way to Dallas. Almost 1-1/2 hours later we were still waiting for our food. When the food did arrive it was warm, and much of it wrong. Just reaffirmed why we don't eat a Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20
Jaletta P.,"Coppell, TX",0,1,,5.0,12/30/2017,"At the last minute, my family decided we needed to avoid being on the road this weekend with the bad weather in Dallas so we met up at Chili's. Everyone was so nice, even when we opened our Christmas presents like weirdos.  Our waitress, Danielle was the sweetest and the manager was great too. Food was yummy! Thanks for a merry Christmas Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Alithea C.,"Sugar Land, TX",92,34,25,5.0,4/17/2017,"I have come to expect mediocre to awful experiences from Chili's but this stop (made on a road trip heading back to Houston) was surprisingly great.  Service by Derrick in the bar area was fantastic, the food was amazing, and the price was right on the mark. Thanks for a great re-fueling for our road trip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Keith S.,"Corsicana, TX",0,8,,4.0,11/3/2017,"I heard Chilis had changed their menu and wanted to check it out. I was super happy to see they put country fried steak back on the menu. It has always been one of my favorites. The new burgers are a half pound and delicious. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars, is I feel the appetizer menu hasnt changed in years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Larry R.,"New Boston, TX",40,43,65,3.0,10/3/2016,"Well to start off with we sat down in bar bar tender went to people who sat down after us. Then came to us her excuse was they were closer ""WoW"" we ordered drinks then she delivered both who sat after us. Then booth across the way then brought only half our drinks the double shot I ordered came around to finally finnish our drink order after she hit three other tables thank god the cooks were on point and made up for the bad bartending. Good food but the waitress slash bartender could have had a better attitude..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Kelly M.,"Mansfield, TX",81,1,,5.0,10/2/2017,We like our Corsicana Chili's. The wait staff is very friendly and they have been trained well. The food is tasty and the price isn't bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Angel T.,"Longview, TX",70,57,9,1.0,1/26/2016,"Wow is all I can say about this chilis.  I do not recommend coming to this location.  We came with a party of 6 to celebrate a birthday and are now leaving after paying for food that was inedible, just to go to mcdonalds to feed everyone.  The appetizers that came AFTER we got our food were so old and cold that after being sent back twice, we just had to give up.  The manager did nothing to remedy any of it even after seeing the food.   I can't even believe food can be sent out that way from such an established restaurant.  The guacamole that came with the fajitas was brown.  The fajitas were old and inedible.  The queso was completely burnt.. TWICE!!  The triple dipper looked like it had sat out for hours (which was the entree for the birthday boy), and was completely inedible.  The cheese fries that came after our food had jalapeños that were so old, the manager even said that shouldn't have come out that way.  The margarita chicken was cold in the middle and again, was completely inedible.   Out of 6 dinners, 3 were eaten.  Out of 3 appetizers, only 1 was eaten.   And again, the manager did not even care to listen.  He simply walked off while I was talking and said he would take the appetizers off the bill. Fellow yelpers, I always tend to give a restaurant a chance for a couple bad reviews because sometimes it's just a bad experience, but this is not just a bad experience, this restaurant needs a serious health inspection and NOW!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Michelle W.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",46,8,,1.0,5/5/2017,"I ordered ribs. They came out cold. The server took them to the back and returned 2 minutes later with them steaming hot. Obviously microwaved and they tasted like it.  Even the asparagus were fibrous. Sorry Chilis, but I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Jennifer C.,"Houston, TX",0,12,,1.0,9/1/2017,"There was a fly in my daughter's drink. The avocado slices on my salad were half black. When I asked for new avocado, I was brought some that was almost as bad as the first. My salad was soggy and swimming in salad dressing. We were charged $1.99 for playing the game on the table, which we hadn't played. My daughter got food poisoning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Bonnie L.,"Mexia, TX",31,16,1,1.0,4/30/2017,Went in and sat for 15 minutes. COULD NOT GET SERVICE. We had to leave. Waitress saw us get up and did nothing! Worst Chilis ever,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Abby L.,"Corsicana, TX",0,8,10,2.0,3/30/2017,So me and my husband love to eat at chili's. Its one of our favorite date spots...but not this one...I get a steak every time I go to chili's and I like my desk medium rare well this one was rare...I couldn't even eat it. Wait staff were nice though they were just understaffed...he only checked on us once.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana

Robin R.,"Bedford, TX",73,22,4,1.0,11/22/2016,"Terrible service! Waited to be sat for over 5 minutes but the place was dead. Once sat waited for another 5 -10 minutes to be asked about drinks. Several employees walking around, sweeping floors, and took me asking for our waiter before he made his first appearance. We choose this place because we were traveling from Fort Worth to Fairfield, next time we will go elsewhere. I'm #chilis",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana

Amanda K.,"Austin, TX",0,18,,3.0,5/22/2016,"We were taken to our table right away, and our server appeared immediately. Ordered our food and drinks, which came in about 5 to 10 minutes. The server was always checking on us about every 2 minutes. Kind of hard to eat when you're having to talk. The food was also a much smaller portion than what was pictured, and the salmon was a little rubbery. The manager did come out and publicly humiliate a new server, because he did not put the salt bottle to the right, and the sugar in the tub was in the incorrect order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Laura H.,"Tulsa, OK",41,150,61,5.0,7/29/2015,"Driving through Texas and stopped for lunch about 2 pm on a weekday. Visit was just what it should be: prompt greeting, friendly service, tasty food. Tried the new Top Shelf tacos with pork and enjoyed them. Hubbie liked the enchiladas he ordered. Am torn about the new table-top tablets with games, menu, ordering, and check-out functions. On the one hand, it's another excuse for people not to talk to each other over a meal. On the other hand, waiting too long for a check after a meal is a pet peeve and the new gadgets eliminate that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Jamie B.,"Corsicana, TX",69,2,,1.0,1/15/2016,"Threat of salmonella poisoning, food poisoning etc.  As someone who was hired on to this location...I warn you.  As I sat down for my interview... There were ants crawling all over the tabl, which the mananger crushed with her fingers, then asked if I'd like a drink.  As a server..I witnessed someone take a DIRTY plate from the dish pit and give it to a cook, then SERVE SOMEONE FOOD ON A DIRTY PLATE.  I SAW SERVERS PICK THEIR NOSES, SCRATCH THEIR ARMPITS & NEVER WASH THEIR HANDS.NOT ONCE.  This place is dirty and breaks numerous health code violations left & right.  I left after my first day there.  Get it together Chili's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
Carolyn L.,"Lakewood, WA",23,4,,1.0,5/15/2016,"We have eaten here quite a few times and up until today service has been great. Today, however, we sit down and wait...finally our drink order and appetizer order is taken. Took considerable time to get here...oh, no napkins or flatware on the table. In fact, my husband had to go to the bar and get the napkins and flatware. When the appetizer got here, chips and salsa, the chips were fried in lumps. Waiter did not check for drink refills...had to ask. Like I said, up till today we have never had a complaint to make but our waiter basically is very bad. Oh...and we have been here long enough for two servings of chips and still waiting for food. The waiter has yet to come back by. We won't give up on this location yet but this kind of service is what causes a normally good business to lose faithful customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana
