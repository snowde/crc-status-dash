Ronald P.,"Los Alamitos, CA",0,18,4,3.0,6/4/2015,"This is my first time at this Chile's, but I'm very familiar with the chain, from other states.  I was hoping in a good dinner with good service, and I received both!   I had the queso and chips for an appetizer. The cheese and sausage mix was served nice and hot, and was delicious--not too spicy for me.  The chips were crisp and nicely salted.  Too often places don't salt their chips, but these were salty and tasty.   Of course I had Diet Coke.  My waitress, Katie, did a good job of keeping it full and keeping up with each item.   My entree was steak an shrimp fajitas.  I heard them coming halfway across the restaurant. The fajitas were served on a bed of onions and green bell peppers, sauteed and sizzling on the cast iron skillet.  I had their delicious guacamole with the shrimp fajitas, and third shredded cheese with the beef.  The didn't work well together so the others I had with salsa.  There were 12 shrimp and 4 steak strips, and all were cooked very nicely, and were tender and tasty.  The meal came with only 3 tortillas, so Katie got me more. The whole meal was good, and the service was very good.   The only drawback was that they turned the t.v. up very loud for sports at 7.  If I come back, it will be earlier in the evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-decatur-5
Chris N.,"Decatur, AL",28,35,22,2.0,10/1/2017,"Ok so the menu changed, and my rating and opinions will reflect.  Taco bell has better quesadillas. Period.  The bacon ranch whathefuckever it's called had no bacon and if it had any kind of ranch it was like the tv show Dallas.  Wife had the potato soup.  Decent flavor,but the marbles represented as potatoes were undesirable. Anyways. It'll  be awhile before I come back.  At least you kept the egg rolls (which were overcooked,and extra greasy,just how we like them.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-decatur-5
Amanda G.,"Hartselle, AL",22,15,72,5.0,11/13/2016,"My family and I love chili's. Coupons are great. Never had a bad experience. The waitresses are always nice. Chips and salsa are wonderful! I recommend the margarita grill chicken with extra limes. The 6oz sirloin is good too especially with the smash potatoes. It's good enough to slap yo momma!! Santa Fe salad is good too it's a little hot and I like hot. 2 for $20 or the choose 2 for $8.99 or 3 for $9.99 chicken quesadillas ummm and u can bring home the rest for later! Flatbreads, even the enchiladas are good. There's something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-decatur-5
Brian R.,"Tallahassee, FL",56,13,,1.0,5/7/2016,Absolute disaster. Waitress didn't know menu. Soups brought out with dinner. Salads missing from dinners. Meals brought out 10 minutes after first group. No water refills until after meal finished.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-decatur-5
Shamika E.,"Decatur, AL",46,2,,2.0,10/17/2015,Staff is almost always friendly. ... food is always cold this is the third time I've visited and had to ask the server to put my meal in the microwave a min longer. It's really ridiculous the proportion you get with these meals and the fact that half the menu is now trying to mimic Mexican dishes is terrible because nothing is worst than unauthentic Mexican food ... I will not be returning to decatur chillis waste of money,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-decatur-5
Ashley R.,"Decatur, AL",41,27,7,2.0,9/19/2015,"Not a good showing this night. I wanted to try a place with the electronic ordering system. Good news is the ""Reorder Drinks"" button work great and being able to pay without interaction with the wait staff is nice. Bad news is that you have to pay for the kids games. Nothing special about the food and service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-decatur-5
Kevin G.,"Somerville, AL",0,2,,1.0,5/22/2016,"Visited on a Friday evening.  Service was good; however, every dish and glass was dirty!  Received first drink in a nasty glass, once it was pointed out, the server served a replacement in a dirty glass, and then the salads arrived on dirty plates.  Spoke with and showed the manager who didn't seem to care.  We left and do not plan on returning!  This is an issue that a restaurant manager should be very concerned about!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-decatur-5
Valerie C.,"Bolingbrook, IL",50,126,13,3.0,8/5/2015,"Went a NOON today and there was no one there!  Got seated right away, order came quickly, server was pleasant, food was edible but not spectacular, love the pay at the table kiosk but the printer was out of paper so I couldn't use it because when they loaded the paper it re-booted and my ticket was removed.  Oh well, I guess you can't have it all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-decatur-5
Tracy C.,"Elkmont, AL",5,14,2,4.0,9/28/2014,First visit to this location. I had the pick three that was very good. They now have a pay at the table option that will speed your lunch visit if you are in a hurry...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-decatur-5
Aimee H.,"Decatur, AL",10,6,1,5.0,8/24/2013,Our server Danielle was fantastic. Quick to get our order and very polite. Our food was made perfectly and served quickly. We enjoyed the meal very much but the best part was the service. A+ server! Everyone should request Danielle.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-decatur-5
