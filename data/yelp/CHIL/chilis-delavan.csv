Arby C.,"Northbrook, IL",1,56,10,4.0,8/1/2017,"It's Chili's. You know what to expect. Decent chain food at a decent price. Beyond that the restaurant was clean & pleasant. The servers were friendly and prompt.  One big negative: The ""white wine,"" as the menu calls it, tasted like rubbing alcohol.  One big positive: The fresh guacamole appetizer was top notch. I'd go back just for that. And not order the wine next time! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Lisa H.,"Yorkville, IL",43,55,44,3.0,10/16/2017,Got seated right away and served drinks quickly. I ordered Southwestern Egg Rolls and was dissapointed because they have shrunk in size and filling. Tasted good. My friends had the Guacamole Burger and Chicken Pasta which they said was good. Typical Chilis for me. Server seemed a bit rushed even tho it was not that crowded but he was nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Melissa S.,"Milwaukee, WI",29,202,879,4.0,9/7/2015,"So as a chain this place sometimes gets an average rap but I like showing up here with my hubby cause where else can you get a meal with appetizer and two entrees for $20. This is the best deal ever. Our go to selection is the guacamole appetizer followed by 2 orders of fajitas (pork and chicken mixed) which arrive with all the sides including more guacamole. Yes we LOVE avocados.  I've had the baby back ribs (half rack), the 6 oz sirloin and the quesadillas. All good for the value price.  And my new favorite is the soda fountain menu which includes way more than just 6 selections. You can get pretty much any coke product regular or diet with flavorings. That's a treat in itself beyond the coke diet coke conundrum.  I give you 4 stars chilis for continuing to innovate and stay fresh in our fast food chain world.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Kristin M.,"Chicago, IL",207,762,879,5.0,10/23/2015,"I'm normally not a fan of chain restaurants and I couldn't tell you the last time I was at a Chili's but this is where we came for lunch on a Saturday for our bachelorette weekend.  I left feeling pleasantly surprised.  I liked that their menu included smaller lunch portions for a lesser price, which is what most of our group of 12 ordered.  Coming in with that large of a group I assumed there would be some sort of mix up but they got every single order correct!  Impressive!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Amy O.,"Glencoe, IL",139,266,228,4.0,10/11/2015,"Happy hour all day on Sunday!  Fun place to watch sports in the bar area in a booth.  $3 domestic drafts, $3 glasses of wine.  Pair that with the dinner for 2 for $20 (which includes 2 entrees and an app to split) and I think you have a good value.  While we don't normally allow iPads at dinner, for $2 the kids can play unlimited games on their iPad type screen so chilis is a fun treat for them!  Sometimes you just want predictable and we like the food and the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Tani V.,"Delavan, WI",1,28,39,4.0,1/2/2017,"In our small town we do not have many choices for dining. Our son wanted a molten cake for his birthday so we took him for dinner. We've been her many many times before. And every time we go it's a different experience... we've had bad experiences we're we've boycotted chilis for months. But this last visit was great.. it was a busy Friday night, we called ahead of time and they were gracious enough to put our name down on the list that way we don't have to wait to be seated. We have a 6 month old baby and we didn't want her getting cranky while we waited. Our server was very nice and the food was delicious. Even though it was busy he was able to gather a few other servers to sing happy birthday to my son. Overall it was a great experience. It all depends on who is serving you, like I said. We've had really bad experiences where we've waited for almost an hour and a half for our food. We ended up leaving that night because our server was being rude when we asked why our food was taking so long.. that's when we left and didn't go back to chilis for 5 months. Then a friend invited us to dinner and they took us back to chilis, the drinks are always great and the food as well.. I believe their main issue is the servers they have working there... some of them are not very nice.. I always order chilis to go and they always do a great job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Scott R.,"Lake Geneva, WI",0,55,126,4.0,6/12/2016,Always good for comfort food and a few drinks. Wait staff and bartenders are always good and quick service for a fast lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Cathryn S.,"Mesa, AZ",1,9,,2.0,7/31/2016,"We stopped here for cocktails on a Sunday afternoon. I overheard a waitress tell a customer (when she brought food to some of the customers at the table) that she was sorry but his steak was given to another customer. What!!! He did not get his steak for at least 15 minutes. He must have made a comment to her when she brought the steak, but I did not hear what he said. The waitress was all the way across the room and almost to the kitchen when she said to the man, ""You better watch your mouth!"" AND ""You just swore in front of your child!"". Really! How unprofessional! Then she must have told everyone in the kitchen area because at least 8 employees came over to look at this poor gentleman. I do believe mgt made amends to the table; but that waitress should be used to dealing with customers and should be fired or disciplined for her actions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Brian M.,"Burlington, WI",0,60,12,4.0,11/4/2016,Great Value if you go for the 2 for $20. We used to come here to watch the NFL ticket on Sundays but last year the stopped carrying it. Still good food at a good price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Cherie G.,"Elkhorn, WI",0,28,,2.0,7/4/2016,"We live in the area and have gone here many times over the years .  We have had good service and not so good service.  The food used to be good a few years ago so the not so good service that we had more often then not we  over looked.  The last few times that we have gone... well... the food has changed for the worst!  Rubbery nasty chicken, stale chips,  customer service lacking!  Not going back!  Not worth the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Catherine B.,"Lake Geneva, WI",0,10,6,1.0,1/10/2015,"Have been going to this Chili's since 2006 usually because it's the only restaurant open late where you can get a drink. We have been served french fries that were terrible, sent them back and they just refried them. It's one of the worst Chili's compared to others I have been to all over the country. They are the only chain restaurant of this type in the area (I wish Lake Geneva had a Chili's or Applebee's) and have a captive audience for their grease  spotted menus,  not so clean kitchen (I always look back there on the way to the bathroom) and poor service.  My husband and I keep telling each other we'll never go back, but we went the Monday following Christmas around 9pm. We waited by the front for about 10 minutes. We could see several open tables, and no else was waiting for a table. When the server came up to us we were heading for the door. My husband said to her that we were just about to leave.  The server said we're really busy in a not nice tone then asked if we were staying or going. She was happy to see us go I'm sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Crystal G.,"Delavan, WI",21,5,1,5.0,4/16/2016,Love going here! If you are ordering a steak ask if Brian is on steaks because he is amazing!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Sean S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,22,,3.0,1/10/2016,"it's Chili's, so you get what you expect from a chain place. It's not bad by any means, but it's no different than any other Chili's I've been to. Decent food and beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
david L.,"Bartlett, IL",8,88,48,4.0,2/22/2016,"Ate dinner with the family here last night. The food was good as usual, consistent with most chili's.  The service was prompt and attentive. I would come back to this location next time we are in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Laura S.,"Sharon, WI",0,13,,4.0,2/5/2016,"The burgers are great for a chain. It's a good ""go to"" place! My kids love the corn on the cob (which is surprisingly good. Can't go wrong with Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Tyler W.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,24,,5.0,7/24/2015,"Chips and Salsa, that is the only thing you need to be happy and chilis has the best in the world.  They have a huge menu and great service. It is a chain so noting too exciting or different about it, but great for groups and not pricey. Some staff could be friendlier, but hey you're atleast getting the best chips and salsa in the world.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Lois P.,"Lake Geneva, WI",7,6,22,5.0,4/28/2014,"Fast and great service. The food was delicious and fulling, we had to bring home doggy bags, so much to eat and very affordable. Will definitely go back, real soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Junell H.,"St. Anne, IL",2,189,,3.0,3/13/2015,Good food! Good service! Need to have stronger chips when ordering the table-side guacamole. The guacamole is so good that you don't want to be passive. The hostess staff certainly could have been friendlier.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Sebastian R G.,"Rockford, IL",93,73,24,3.0,9/9/2015,"stopped here for a quick dinner on my way back from the University; I don't go to Chili's that often, so I don't know how a Chili's should be at its best and its worst.  Was the food good? well I had the buffalo chicken salad, and honestly, I've had better. (I know, I know, this is a Grill&Bar place, but I've had better salads at places of Grill&Bar). It wasn't enough salad per say, as in little to no Romaine, and almost nothing of chicken. I also asked for some Avocado, barely received some....soo.... Can you help here?  The Ranch dressing took away the buffalo flavor, maybe a little tip here, sub ranch and do Blu Cheese dressing? change the recipe, maybe? and maybe as well add more, oh, I don't know...kick to the salad, more fab to it, more zang and zip? try this: Spinach and Field a Greens, with Avocado, Cilantro, Blu Cheese dressing with Feta cheese/Parmesan, Almonds, Red Onion, baby Tomatoes and then the Buffalo Chicken=shredded and scattered in the salad.? sounds better then what I ordered at Chili's. Clean? yes, the manage was out cleaning all the time, Bathrooms, umm, no. The bathrooms were pretty dirty. Toilet paper on the ground, soap overflowing on the counter, just dirty.  Service? yes, it was good, Joe was our server and she did her job, knew everything and answered my questions correctly.She made my Chili's experience good.  Overall, Chili's was OKAY. not the best, but then again as I stated, I don't go to Chili's that often to know when it's good or not. Would I go back? No..I'm better at the Chili's at my hometown, Dick's Sporting Goods, or the one off of Rt 173. Those places actually look clean from all over the place.  (9-6-15)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Ben B.,"Holland Park, London, United Kingdom",0,16,,3.0,8/10/2015,"The server took a while to come to our table, but once she came, she was very nice and quick with getting our order out. The food is where the main problem with Chili' is. The food at Chili's just is not that good, I guess that is what you get from a chain restaurant. The chips and salsa and the chicken enchilada soup are the two best items on the menu at Chili's. This Chili's is very clean, which is a plus. Overall though, it is a very average experience at Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan
Frank N.,"Highland Park, IL",270,260,83,3.0,2/27/2011,"Went up to the lake house today and stopped in for lunch.  It was pretty busy for lunch and we waited for a table and since there were 6 of us, the wait would be 45 minutes or we could have two booths back to back.  We opted for the latter. The greeter was pleasant and attentive. The food was good but not mind-blowing.  I had the California Club Toasted Sandwich and it was a nice light sandwich with avocado and bacon.   Our waitress was very nice and she did her job well considering she looked like she was over-worked and the restaurant understaffed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan?start=20
Jeremy C.,"Lake Geneva, WI",0,3,,2.0,4/4/2015,Stopped in for a late dinner Saturday night...seated quickly by a confused hostess...first of all..I understand it is Saturday night but this place is a disaster....and I see idle hands...time to lean time to clean right?..anyways I had the sirloin...decent for chilis I suppose add 6 shrimp...nice touch...oh wait I just found out they were 699...the worst part was my friends chipotle chix crisper meal...it was awful...we kept joking how it tasted like a barn yard smells...at the end of the meal we were solicited to donate money to the childrens hospital on the spot...a litttle uncomfortable for my taste...jim was a very nice waiter though....all in all I really knew I should have gone to panera,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan?start=20
Jaime J.,"Genoa City, WI",2,18,2,4.0,8/31/2015,Our best day here. The waiter was awesome. I loved my chicken quesadilla and the bottomless chips and salsa rocked. I love the chicken sandwich with bacon and honey mustard. Great service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan?start=20
Bry S.,"Delavan, WI",0,13,,3.0,9/21/2014,"It's a Chilis. You know what you're going to get. Decent food, decent price, decent service. This Chilis has never let me down. Update: this Chili's has been remodeled and it wasn't for the better. Also, it may be bad luck but my service hasn't been very good since the remodel. Kind of sad but there's plenty of non chain places to go in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan?start=20
Nichole F.,"Chicago, IL",261,449,219,3.0,7/5/2012,Went here very late one night.  There was nothing else open.  The service was just okay.  We felt like our server was concentrating more on starting to close then to wait on us.  The food was good.  I had a chicken salad and a tea because it was cold in there for some reason.  My husband had chicken fingers which were also delicious.   I would go back here but I would avoided going around closing time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delavan?start=20
Jim G.,"Elkhorn, WI",0,48,,1.0,12/1/2013,Wife and I sat at bar and waited 10 min to have someone take our drink order even thought it was not busy.

Laura J.,"Delavan, WI",7,2,4,1.0,4/27/2013,"Not impressed. Chicken Avocado sandwich blah served on Texas toast, margarita served in a root beer mug and 2/3 full of ice does not make it less boring!

Nathan R.,"Roscoe, IL",0,4,,3.0,4/27/2014,"There was no wait amd the service was good.
