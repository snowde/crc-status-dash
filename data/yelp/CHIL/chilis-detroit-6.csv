Jill P.,"Aiea, HI",89,125,77,3.0,7/17/2016,It wasn't that bad. As far as airport restaurants go...it served its purpose: to keep me from starving & becoming a super grumpy passenger!  Tip: sit at the bar...you'll get waited on quicker. I got the classic bacon burger with fries. It took about 10-15 min to come out. They make them medium-rare...so if you want it prepared differently all you have to do is ask.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Brenda E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,27,47,1.0,7/21/2017,"This Chili's is horrible. I ordered a salad and the lettuce was old. It look like some one toss old lettuce in thousand island dressing and mixed in chipotle sauce. I spoke with the manager and I changed the order to a Old Stoney burger and fries (could have gotten this at Wendy's for less). The waitress never came back to me, I had to go ask was my to go order ready and can I have a to go cup for the drink. She was concerned about if she can take my credit card ... without seeing the bill, uh no!!!  No discount just time wasted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Sabi L.,"San Diego, CA",285,262,425,4.0,7/28/2016,Came here for a beer since my flight was delayed to 1 am. It's your typical Chili's. Can never really go wrong or right here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Kellie B.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",0,1,,1.0,8/4/2017,"This was possibly the worst Chili's I've ever eaten at.  The restaurant was dirty, the food was horrible with much smaller portions and the service was extremely slow.  I ordered a Quesadilla Explosion salad.  It took over 25 minutes to get my food.  When it arrived the Chicken was luke warm and the lettuce was brown and slimy.  The Quesadilla was rock hard on the edges and crumbled as you ate the middle.  It took over 90 minutes for my lunch and I had to track the waitress down to get my check.  Go over to A terminal and eat at the Tex Mex restaurant down by gate A74.  Much better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Chris S.,"Windsor, Canada",1,16,4,3.0,12/11/2016,"I got the lesser priced hamburger. Although way more expensive than fast food chains, it wasn't that great. A very slightly ahead of McDonald's deluxe hamburger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Ruixuan R.,"Allendale, MI",0,2,1,1.0,4/29/2016,"I'd agree that this is the worst choice at DTW. My drink order wasn't taken care of after 15 mins, then I waited for another half an hour to get my food and 20 mins to get the bill. HONESTLY SLOTH COULD'VE DONE A BETTER JOB & PEOPLE HAVE FLIGHTS TO CATCH. Food looked nasty and the only taste I got was salt. One star it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Alex P.,"Atlanta, GA",432,834,1721,1.0,5/15/2014,"This place is SO bad that I cannot put a proper description together in words. Airport food frequently tends to be bad, and this is unfortunately not an exception. My dress pants are now covered in grease from the fajitas that were placed on my table and shooting hot oil everywhere. To top it off, I've had to sit for 15 min at the dirty bar until someone noticed me. The fajita portion was tiny!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Jake K.,"Rutherford, NJ",5,7,9,1.0,7/1/2016,Horrible service . Ordered queso and chips and it took 24 minutes. Bartender MICHELLE rude. Throwing dishes around. Obviously not a happy person. 2 double margaritas were $39. Don't do it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Valeshia V.,"The Loop, Chicago, IL",5,6,,1.0,3/10/2016,Slowest service I've ever had. Drink order wasn't taken for 15 minutes. Just sat here waiting for service. My food ended up arriving before my drink. Horrible service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
David F.,"Reston, VA",366,22,,2.0,2/2/2016,Not sure what chilis is trying to do here. I'm so bored I decided to write this in the restaurant. Staff was great but the food is the same old nasty stuff. You would think with the revamp and new decor the food would be higher quality but it disappoints. My sam adams did taste like sam adams and the staff was good so 1 star for each.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Mark R.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",39,12,,1.0,4/1/2016,"Not a great option at DTW.  So many good new choices since leases all renewed.  Was near the gate so gave it a try.  Nasty breakfast, average service, but decent Bloody Mary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Tamara K.,"Detroit, MI",113,208,470,3.0,3/16/2014,Great quesadillas.  Service is pretty good but can be slow depending on the time of day. Breakfast menu was surprisingly good also.  It is pricier than a typical restaurant but it is in the airport.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Joshua H.,"Tempe, AZ",11,8,14,5.0,5/17/2014,Best place to eat in the airport. Good customer service and good food. Other places like coney island and Heineken lounge don't compare simply because the attitude of the environment is terrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Marcus B.,"Rochester, MI",10,13,6,3.0,12/4/2014,"This location has a very limited menu persumably so they can offer faster service. The service here however is slower than most chilis restaurants I have been in. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat between flights this is not the place to come to. If you are not pressed for time this is a nice place to hang out and decompress on a long layover. Although the menu is limited, they do have have most of the chili staples such as burgers, chips and salsa etc.  You can of course expect to pay the typical airport premiums.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Milford S.,"Takoma Park, MD",0,8,,2.0,2/4/2016,I got a burger.  Overcooked.  Fries not hot.  Won't go there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Dave H.,"San Antonio, TX",213,485,220,2.0,9/5/2014,"Got a flight to catch?  Don't come here.  Pressed for time?  Don't come here.  Got a long layover and don't mind slow service, come here.  The food was your standard fare from Chili's.  Nothing spectacular.  And then the check came. $9 for a draft beer. I didn't pay that much in London!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Jordan H.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",0,3,,1.0,2/25/2016,The service is extremely slow. I left and went to the Irish pub down the hall which was fantastic!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Ben M.,"Yarmouth, ME",21,21,1,1.0,6/22/2014,"This is definitely the worst airport restaurant I've been to.  I've never been compelled to actually write a review while sitting in the actual restaurant, but what else am I going to do while waiting for someone to notice me.  I have a 3 hour layover, so time is not an issue for me, but I've seen at least 8 different parties virtually begging for a drink or lay for their check or get their food...  The bartender sometimes bartends, when he's not in the back, and when they decide to pay attention to you they are incredulous when you are frustrated.  I used to work at a chilis in college, so I have a soft spot for them, but man is this place bad.  They're lucky there aren't many options at dtw...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Owen G.,"Merritt Island, FL",1,17,,1.0,8/10/2014,Skip this restaurant. Incompetent hostess and seating. Cup of chili was inedible ( out of some can ),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Jeremy J.,"Raleigh, NC",0,60,14,3.0,8/14/2014,"We sat down to spend some time before our flight. I've been to this restaurant before and it's had good service and ""ok"" food. I guess it is worth trying if none of the other places sound good, and compared to the others, this would get more credit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6
Matt H.,"Charleston, SC",2,51,42,2.0,8/11/2014,"Tons of ppl waiting to be seated, tons of empty tables, tons of staff standing around doing nothing. Menu was out of several items or could not be prepared due to broken equipment in kitchen.  Only reason for 2 stars and not 1 was bc our server was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-detroit-6?start=20
