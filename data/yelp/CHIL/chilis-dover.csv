Jennifer B.,"Rochester, NH",7,42,,4.0,11/27/2017,"This is my favorite chain in Dover. Although service is sometimes lacking, you can't beat the food. Love the classic nachos, fajitas, Southwest eggrolls.......I love it all. On top of that although the drinks aren't cheap, they are fair and not watered down. I always get a bar booth and never have to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Erik H.,"Dover, NH",12,12,12,3.0,2/4/2017,"Was watching a basketball game, another patron asked server if she could change channel. Instead of server asking anybody if it was alright or anything, she just went ahead. In  the future, if anyone wants a server to change channel, they, should ask other patrons if all right. Just not right to just do it cause it is group and/or they are drinking liquor and/or beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Bill I.,"Somersworth, NH",59,42,46,4.0,5/14/2017,"Always good, good sevice, goodchoices and good food. Sit in the bar and pick which screen you want to watch, plenty of choices of entertainment. We just went in for apps. and a beer and split 3 apps. and that was plenty for us. The Buffalo Cauliflower fos awesome. Will recommend and will rwturn several times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover

Monika R.,"San Diego, CA",6,22,10,1.0,4/11/2017,"This place has gone down hill.  I used to come here all the time since I live in Dover and Chillies has a nice new menu. I was here on April 11, Tuesday around 1:30pm.  I sat at the bar and the bartender stayed completely out of the bar area.  Avoiding eye contact from me to delay the service as much as possible. Hoping I will get mad and leave.  Same thing happened with the other gentleman who came after me and sat at the bar.  Mind it that it was Tuesday afternoon and it was not busy at all. I couldn't  find anyone to ask for a manager.   I am assuming there is no manager currently on duty and that's why this is happening. Manager should take note of this and find out who was working and take action.  It would be best for the restaurant to not have servers like that and will prevent frustrations for customers. It's not right or acceptable",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Paul W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,,1.0,5/27/2017,"The manager of the bar took the situation out of control when our party came in for a snack. We were told that one of our party members was cut off. We weren't bothering anyone and certainly weren't intoxicated. I'm writing this the moment we got kicked out. The manager quickly overreacted and called the police. We spoke to them and they told us any establishment can decide to serve or not. That's fair. But then we were told we were threatening to the manager which was a lie. The whole night tonight sucked. I was told I threatened someone because that was the best excuse for the manager to justify an overreaction. To be honest, the manager got caught in a power trip and it was very frustrating because there was no solution that she would listen to at any point. I like chilis as an institution. This manager has a lot to learn to be a responsible employee.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Jonathan B.,"Burlington, MA",63,34,,3.0,6/18/2017,"No matter where you go, Chili's is the same regardless. A chain restaurant that would compete with Appleb's and the 99. We came here for lunch, we sat at the bar area. Cool thing I noticed was that they carry local craft beers on tap and you just have ask your server about them. I got a Tuckers pale ale while my Fiancé got a watermelon drink with vodka. Both were fantastic. For lunch she got a regular burger and I got the prime rib tacos. The tacos were a nice change, that's what makes Chili's a little different from the competition. They have tex mex and a load of different food you can get. For desert we got the cookie skillet which is always good. The reason for the three stars was that the service was okay at best. Our server made sure to go around every table she had to nail into the customers that she wanted them to give her a good review. Not that she didn't deserve a good one but being petty is a real turn off for the customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Keriann F.,"East Longmeadow, MA",81,9,,5.0,9/2/2016,"Conscious of food allergies, they definitely made me feel safe! I don't really eat sides like fries, corn, or salads so since my chicken crispers came with it I asked for double the chicken serving instead and they were happy to accommodate! I'm very happy with the friendly service and how quickly we got our food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Chris C.,"Dover, NH",10,24,9,4.0,11/2/2014,Best of the chain restaurants......waitstaff is great and the table side guac is awesome! Very kid friendly too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Christina W.,"Amherst, MA",53,9,3,2.0,11/1/2013,"Wow...this place was just not good. As a disclaimer; I am a huge fan of Chili's. I love their food, and have never had a bad meal at any of the restaurants....until tonight.  With that being said, after we were seated, and told our waitress' name, we had to wait 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us...my wife had mentioned walking out and going to Uno's, when they came right over. Laden with excuses, and after claiming it was the hostess' fault and not theirs, we finally were able to order our drinks and food. I ordered the Ribeye, medium, with potatoes and broccoli. My wife ordered the 6 oz sirloin also medium and with potatoes and broccoli.  When we received our food, our server had asked us to cut into our steaks, and walked away before we could even take our silver-wear out of the paper napkin... My Ribeye came with garlic butter on top. It was tender, and quite melt-in-your-mouth. The wife's steak was a nice red/pink, and just perfect. That, friends, was the only upside to our meal. My steak was closer to medium-well than medium, being more grey than pink. The garlic butter added some flavor to the meat, but it was mostly salt, as was almost everything else.  My wife enjoyed the loaded potatoes; cheese, chives and bacon included. I thought they were alright. Both of our broccoli's were covered in salt, with a little bit of pepper mixed in. The wife couldn't really eat her's, and I just kinda cruised through them, without a thought until later in the meal.  I did enjoy my Pomegranate Margarita, as a starter to my meal. They used Patron in it, which was quite smooth and nice.  When the check came, our waitress couldn't have even comped my wife's soda for the shitty service. We walked out bloated with salt, and not quite satisfied. Next time we're in Dover, we'll be going to our old standby; Friendly's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Wyatt T.,"Sanbornville, NH",41,73,21,3.0,3/17/2014,"Bullet point review: -Spacious -Nice tile tables -Mugs seemed cheap but effective -Liked how the dressing containers weren't cheap plastic -Like the angular plates -Acceptable pop music -Minimal decorations, high ceilings -Decent pricing for lunch combo plus appetizer - you get what you pay for -Jumbo pretzels good -Salad fresh, no Italian my favorite, but ranch always a good fall back -Slow when we went, manager checked with us twice -Was taken aback by the few fries included with the sandwich, but it is included in a cheap combo; use to always seeing stacks of fries with meals at dinner -Sandwich was very tasty, moist and crunch, fries good -Service acceptable, standard",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Danielle R.,"Barrington, NH",0,6,,2.0,12/1/2015,"Let's start off with saying I love Chilis food, so this is quite the bummer. I came here with my parents, husband, daughter, and sister for a 30th anniversary dinner for my parents, in hopes of having a fun relaxing night. Well, that didn't happen. First off the hostess that sat us kept referring to my daughter as a HE, I corrected her and said ""SHE will be sitting in a highchair because SHE is big enough to sit up alone"" The hostess replied with ""I'll put the highchair on this side for him to sit in""... Which, by the way, was on the opposite side of the table from where my husband and I put our coats? Maybe she was just confused, or new? So, after re-arranging the table/seating and waiting about 10 minutes our server arrived. We ordered 4 waters and a soda, he asked if he could bring us some chips and salsa, [we mistakenly thought this meant it was an offering from the restaurant, like 99 gives you popcorn, longhorn gives you rolls, farm gives you cornbread, not an item we would be paying for, whoops] He came back with 3 waters and a soda then quickly left. My sister and I had to share our water until he came back with the chips. I asked for another water, which he did eventually bring, but never noticed his error. We had some issues with ordering our margaritas, but not a big deal. Then we ordered dinner. Two of the 5 meals came out correctly. One didn't even come out until we pointed out we were missing it. ALSO our fried pickles came out with the meals rather than the appetizer they were ordered as. My mothers egg rolls and fathers margarita chicken came out as planned, but my sisters quesadillas arrived with cilantro, she made a point to say no to the cilantro, the waiter made a joke about how they'll clear the restaurant of cilantro before making her dish. HA. HA. My California turkey club came without bacon, avacado, or the onion, he must have wrote down a different turkey sandwich completely? Whatever, I ate it since I had to share it with my husband since he hadn't received his food. We had to bring it to his attention 5 minutes later when he checked on us. So after we were done with our meas my husband received his burrito, WITH the pico de galo inside, which he asked not to even have, he hates tomatoes and onions... We brought this to our waiters attention and he asked if we wanted him to take it off the bill, wait for a different one to be made, take part of it off the bill? What? Why is that our decision? Aren't you the waiter? Go talk to your manager and figure it out, don't put us in an awkward situation. Then he comes back to tell us he took a hit and discounted the burrito half off and did we ""just want the check?"" we hadn't even ordered our dessert that came with the $35 for 2 deal.. So we had to remind him of that, ordered a molten cake and told him we had a coupon for a free dessert on our phone, he said ""okay"" then left without asking what free dessert we'd like to order. 10 minutes later we received the molten cake, but not from him, so when he finally arrived we asked for another molten cake to go since we had finished the first one already. We ha another awkward experience with the bill since the receipt didn't print out and the waiter didn't seem to think we needed one so he made a big deal about having to print another one for us. UGH. 2 hours and an awkward meal later we were headed home with a sour taste for chilis in our mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Ron F.,"Cheney, WA",0,17,,1.0,2/19/2015,Waited forever for our apps. Ordered a steak medium rare was brought one rare. Waitress offered to take it back and have it cooked some more but I declined. The broccoli was ice cold so at that point I had the meal sent back and just had the mashed potatoes. The Manager did make things right I must say. His explanation was that there was New cooks and they were super busy. Not much of an excuse for poor cooks. But they did apologize over and over and comped that part of the meal and offered something on the house.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Nick M.,"Dover, NH",2,71,3,4.0,5/13/2013,"Chili's in Dover is very loud! Its always packed.  That being said, We love the food! the fajitas are wonderful and they are a great bargain on Mondays.  The drinks are very good and cheap!  fun place to watch a game.

Robert C.,"Worcester, MA",85,133,378,3.0,1/14/2013,"We have visited this location for years! Our most recent visit was this past Sunday for a family celebration.  Our waitress was amazing. Our drinks were never empty and out bottomless chips were always full. The two for 20$ deal is well worth it. All three couples got the deal and were happy. The chipotle chicken crisped were excellent, the fajitas were tasty and the ribs were succulent.  Enjoy this chills not all have a great staff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Will P.,"Portsmouth, NH",643,322,1327,2.0,9/30/2013,"A chain, and an old edition, somewhat run down, of a once decent chain.  Not great service, very mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Lauren B.,"Portsmouth, NH",69,100,23,2.0,3/2/2014,"Just al around a poor experience.  Sat at the bar, it was sticky from the last persons margarita and the bartender never wiped it down. She poor the beers almost straight up and the kegs pump so fast it was foamy. She continued to poor so it was spilled over the sides and starved every single beer dripping like that to everyone. Really hey taught you that in bartender school? Food was decent what you would expect. The bartender was completely un attentive and the music was straight contemporary pop from the 80s ... Very outdated. No reason to stop here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Kris T.,"Windham, ME",1,87,,2.0,6/20/2012,"Went here the other day for the first time in years.  I had just seen that they had a ""soup, salad, sticks"" deal, similar to other chain restaurants, consisting of chips/salsa, soup and salad.  I was rather excited to try it. I shouldn't have been.  The salad was actually quite good, in a basic way; thus, I have no complaints on that end.  The chips were decent, not great, but pleasant.  The salsa was rather boring and uninspired.  One can find better almost anywhere. The soups just sucked.  I tried the chili (which they charged more for), expecting an average offering.  Instead I got a lukewarm, under-spiced mess, full of hard clots of meat.  If you have ever over-fried a burger, and the outer char turned into a hard, plastic-like coating, just imagine that surrounding every piece of meat in the chili.  It was an effort to chew through it, and the dry meat underneath. The chicken enchilada soup had the exact opposite problem.  All the meat in it was so fatty, and gelatinous that I gagged with every bite; which, as one might imagine, took away from the otherwise decent broth.   There was not one enjoyable bite in either soup. Coupled with my girlfriend's expensive dinner salad, which was half the size as when I used to order them here, and also rather boring, and a pattern emerges.  Quality has taken a few steps down, and this is no longer the ""slightly trashy"" chain experience I once occasionally indulged in,  it's just trashy.  I would add, the service was fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Jaden B.,"Rollinsford, NH",79,19,,4.0,10/8/2012,"I am not sure why everyone is giving this Chili's such awful reviews... This is our family's standby choice for a quick dinner. We absolutely love the $35 meal deal (which includes an app, two entrees, two margaritas and a dessert) and have been hard-pressed to find such value at any other local restaurants, chains or otherwise. The wait staff here is extremely competent and friendly and they are always welcoming to us and our daughter. The food is normally quite good and served hot. We have only had them mess up our order once and it was quickly remedied. We enjoy going here and visit at least once a month!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Rachel G.,"Somersworth, NH",17,40,18,2.0,9/14/2010,"It's a huge franchise.  Not much else to say here.  Service varies WIDELY depending on when you come in and who serves you.  It tends on the slow wide though.  But for the most part the servers are friendly. Appetizers are pretty tasty, entrees vary.  Used to be better",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover
Heather Anna W.,"Clifton Springs, NY",27,105,42,2.0,7/2/2011,"Servers were friendly and the atmosphere was nice.  The food was about a 4 or so on a scale of 1-10.  I got a Cobb Salad and the chicken was dry and had some fat on it, the avocados were a bit brown and colder than the salad, the dressing was too thick and flavorless, the bacon was tough and the lettuce was all iceberg and not too crispy.  With the prices, I expect more.  My mother-in-law got a burger that she thought was just ok, but she really liked the fries.  My husband got a Calafornia club and said it was just so-so.  The bathrooms weren't that clean either.    The table was really uncomfortable.  On one side you had tons of room and directly across you were squished in and the table was fixed to the wall so you couldn't change it.  I won't return for that price.  I had a better salad at Friendly's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dover?start=20
