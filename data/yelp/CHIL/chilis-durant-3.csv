Barry E.,"Boswell, OK",10,1,,5.0,9/7/2017,"The food is consistently good, but the best part is how friendly Lisa and Misty are behind the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Sam M.,"San Antonio, TX",45,358,828,3.0,10/17/2016,"3 stars For the food and that's the end of the story.  I've stopped here twice. Once last year and then again today. We sat at the bar both times. Exact same spot. Our server was the same both times and when we sat down, I immediately remembered how awful our service was the prior time.  I'm one on giving everyone a second run.  Well, here's the deal. She cares deeply about her regulars but newbies not so much.  The give sways was that we didn't receive any napkins and had to keep reaching over the bar for drink napkins while one of her regulars was provided plenty.  She didn't listen to my order(forgot rice and beans)  and then as always on cue became overly attentive towards check time.  Don't sit at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Robert R.,"Sumner, TX",14,20,1,5.0,11/10/2017,"Food is much better. More like they used to be. Miss alot of the old dishes they had, but I love Chili's! The curbside ordering is wonderful! Poor Applebee's doesn't have a chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Chris L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",53,363,194,5.0,12/7/2016,"My brother and I wanted something to eat and this is one of the place I like because of the 2 for $20.  When we got there it was around 11:30am and so there wasn't many people on staff so it took a little while to get seated.  I wished I was seated a little faster because there was hardly anyone in the restaurant but it is all good.  The bartender came around pretty quickly and got our order.  We ordered chips and salsa, quesadilla and a margarita chicken dish.  Our order was fresh, hot and delicious.  I really love having hot chips with my chips and salsa.  Loved the experience and if I am in town I will stop by here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Amelia K.,"Durant, OK",0,23,1,4.0,10/31/2017,Fast service even when they are extremely busy. The restaurant is clean but a little cramped if you are sitting in the middle.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Jeff G.,"Houston, TX",7,49,75,4.0,4/18/2017,Fun place. All the employees are great. Very friendly. The food is consistent with other Chili's. The Oreo molten cake is delicious! I love the crunch of Oreo cookies mixed with cold vanilla ice cream and hot melted marshmallow inside. The black and white cake was a nice touch as well. This is a great Chili's restaurant that stands out in my mind. Highly recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Kimberly M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",204,118,110,5.0,6/28/2015,"Katie was our server and she killed it.  Friendly and on top of our requests.  With our family's food allergies, it's always a question of if people will be able to understand what we need or be able to handle it.  This place was prompt and and friendly.   And always try the blackberry lemonade!  Yumm!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Julie T.,"Wasilla, AK",31,7,,1.0,10/11/2016,"Generally, I enjoy eating at Chili's restaurants from Alaska to Texas. This was NOT the case today in Durant, OK. There were issues with both orders - undercooked chicken tenders and brown, warm lettuce on a salad. Don't know how to cook chicken strips thoroughly? Don't know how to keep a salad cold and crispy? IDK but methinks this Chili's just doesn't care!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Robin S.,"Carefree, AZ",0,25,,4.0,7/30/2015,"I love this Chilli's. Anytime I drive into Durant with my father we have a tradition to stop here. The food is typical Chilli's food. I have never had anything over or under cooked. It's just Chilli's! I absolutely love the gaming system they provide. My father and I sit and play he Trivia game and have a blast.  My 4 star rating is for two reasons, the first is service is hit or miss. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it sucks. You never know what to expect even if it's a waitress you have had more than once. One day she is awesome and the next, not so much. The second is the salt! Forget about using it. For whatever reason it is so moist you can not shake it out. I know that sounds silly to many, but literally every time I go I am unable to use their salt. They claim it's some health code and they can not put rice in it to dry it out. Well, whatever the reason, I am giving a 4 star for that and unreliable service. HOWEVER, it's still one of the very best spots in Durant so check it out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Justin K.,"Hot Springs, AR",0,3,,1.0,11/6/2016,"User reviews are spot on with service, very very slow! Food quality about average for Chilis. Lady manager stated, ""it is not uncommon for food to take 45-55 minutes if they are busy."" When there are empty seats and no waiting lines, I'd not call the restaurant to busy...we were in the restaurant for 1 hour and 45 minutes, of this 10 min for the waitress to take our order for water and food. 55 min for food delivery, approximately 12 min for bring ticket for a tax exempt Vietnam Vet. We had 6 people in our party. Waitress never once asked if we liked our food or if everything was ok. The lady manager definitely lacks the skills to manage, probably best to stay in a small town. Her customer service is pathetic, other restaurants in the area, consider it a blessing not to have her at your place of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Elizabeth L.,"Durant, OK",14,15,1,1.0,12/5/2015,"I will NEVER eat here again. I've been to this restaurant several times, and it just continues to get progressively worse with each visit. Tonight was the last time I'll eat there again. We ordered food to go and we were already back to our home before we realized that they had forgotten part of our order (but they were sure to charge us for it.) The part of our order that they didn't forget was messed up as well. My medium-well steak was burned to a crisp, and my husband's medium steak was still mooing. My daughter's pineapple slices were mixed with green onions. My serving of rice equaled about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of rice that was stuck to the bottom of another container. To top it off, everything was cold. It was just a disappointing and frustrating experience. This used to be one of my favorite places in Durant. Sadly, this restaurant has just gone down hill. I've never had issues with the servers, but the food is horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
A S.,"Plano, TX",26,140,136,5.0,1/9/2016,We ate here for lunch today and Misty waited on us. The service was great! She was very attentive and so nice. Food was so good and came out fast. We will definitely be back to this one! The margarita chicken was so yummy and my son for the wings ! He loved them. Husband got the chicken salad and nephew got the quesadillas ! All was yummy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Ivy P.,"Hollister, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/29/2015,"The manager as of June 29th 2015 called a 75 year old woman at my table a ""smart ass"" and was extremely hateful and rude to us all night. This is unacceptable behavior and he should be FIRED! Worst experience ever! I will not be going to Chili's while he's still the manager!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
Alicia J.,"Austin, TX",135,303,14,2.0,5/25/2012,"When in Rome (on Mother's Day), do as the Romans do (on Mother's Day). This seemed like the most popular place in town and my granny wanted ribs, so I ended up at a Chili's against all odds. I ordered a Caribbean Salad, which was supposed to be mixed greens with ""fresh pineapple, mandarin oranges, dried cherries, green onions, cilantro, sesame seeds and honey-lime dressing."" What I got was half iceberg (gross) and half baby greens with one huge ring of pineapple, four mandarin slices, chicken and my requested tortilla chip strips. I only ordered that shit for the cherries and cilantro but there were none in sight. Whatever, though. My granny loved her ribs and my mom loved her steak. Mission: accomplished (though I'll avoid going back).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3

Joe M.,"Lane, OK",0,1,,4.0,5/22/2012,This is always a good place for a burger and a beer. Sometimes just for a beer. Clean and friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-durant-3
