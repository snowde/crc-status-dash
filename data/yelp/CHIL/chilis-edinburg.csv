Cliff B.,"Edinburg, TX",7,204,1318,4.0,4/20/2017,"I had a business lunch at the Edinburg Chili's today.  I had not been in quite a while. I found the menu has been updated with several new entrees.   Along all the many food options from soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, bbq ribs, wings, chicken ""crispers"" and more, I was intrigued with the new Tex Mex bowls, which appear to be very similar to the bowls served at Chipotle's.   I was pleased to find that among all their very full drink menu, they serve fresh brewed iced tea, both unsweetened and sweet.  Non of that instant powdered stuff or reconstituted concentrate mess for me.   I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Fresh Mex Bowl.  It sounded somewhat healthy, and was delicious.  Tonight I looked up the nutritional information and wish I hadn't (over 40 grams of fat!). But oh, so good! I added some extra pico de gallo.   My colleagues seemed happy with their choices.  Our server was great and we were very well attended.  Friendly and efficient while letting us have our conversation.  We did have to remind our server to bring some extra lime.   The ambience was nice.  Bathroom was clean.  The only thing I would have changed was the volume of the music.  It was loud enough that I had a difficult time hearing the person directly in front of me for the electric guitar.  I wish restaurants would learn what background music means.  I should have requested the volume be turned down.  Next time I will.   The parking was ample, great location (in the shopping center on 107 and Jackson, in front of Freedom Fitness, next to Denny's).  Overall I enjoyed my visit and think you would also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edinburg
Patrick F.,"Edinburg, TX",63,55,215,4.0,9/6/2016,It's Chilies. The food won't blow you away but it won't disappoint you either. The servers are generally really good but the bar service is usually slow.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edinburg
Adrienne C.,"Round Rock, TX",116,286,103,2.0,4/23/2016,"Should have known upon walking in to a crowd for lunch and a confused host that this was not going to be the best experience. Host asked us which side we wanted to sit at, I said left (bar) side I guess, so he seats us on right side. It was probably 5 minutes until a waitress came to take drink order, I asked if there were any drink specials, she said you have to sit on other side for that, ridiculous, no drinks for us I guess.  We both ordered the carnitas lunch special,  they forgot to bring tortillas at first, and I never got a plate to eat off of so I used my hand. Little fabric piece that covers skillet handle looks like it's never washed. Yuck. Table is too small for two skillet meals to fit. The only redeeming quality was that the food was delicious. Unfortunately I cannot recommend coming here because the rest of the experience is too unsatisfactory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edinburg
Rafael C.,"Edinburg, TX",0,47,21,3.0,8/6/2016,Chills claims they are the King of the burger. Yet in order to get the grass fed beef you have to pay $1.00 extra. Really 1.00 upgrade. What a joke.  Walked and got the molten chocolate cake. Nice and quiet for a Saturday.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edinburg
Mario C.,"Edinburg, TX",4,6,,2.0,2/3/2017,"While Chilis has always been a trendy spot to get decent food and drinks. There To Go service is very poor. First they have To Go parking spots for those patrons picking up, yet they're all taken up by the customers eating inside. I know this because I was the only one in the To Go area. Secondly they're in so much of a rush they don't bother checking the order which led to my order being wrong. When we called to let them know the manager seemed very uninterested in resolving this logically, as if I don't mind driving all the way back to the restaurant only to have to park at a distance as the first time. To Go Chilis is a joke and will avoid this service in the future. I'll stick to ranting about them while dining inside with a margarita",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edinburg
Debra V.,"McAllen, TX",0,4,,1.0,10/23/2016,Our company just ordered lunch for my department and we must say this is the worst lunch we have had in a while. From the time we ordered to the time they said it'd be ready was short considering there were 5 meals. Then they almost forgot some of the soups for our order. We get our food and the fries in our lunch combo can literally be counted and the food is COLD (we are not located far from Chili's). The food is not just cold like it was cooling down...it is cold like it was sitting out for a long time!!! Since it didn't take that long to get the meals ready that's why it's COLD. This is such a disappointment...they need to step it up! And make sure you add condiments like ketchup and don't forget the soup spoons....for the love of God! This is RIDICULOUS I cannot handle it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edinburg
Josh R.,"McAllen, TX",1,3,5,4.0,3/7/2015,"My girlfriend and I went here for a weekend lunch, and we're pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. Fast service, friendly, and MOST importantly, food was hot and fresh. Good atmosphere, can't wait to go back, dessert is always good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edinburg
Flora Ybarra W.,"Edinburg, TX",0,1,,1.0,4/29/2015,Very bad service you can not even talk loud in the bar area. And food is bad all manager need to be fired.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edinburg
Joseph P.,"Edinburg, TX",12,16,3,4.0,5/17/2014,"Visited this restaurant twice in the past six months. My wife and I are not a regular eat-out people but we go to restaurants when we have to entertain some friends or important people. Even though I don't disagree with the comments about delay as mentioned in some reviews below, we have to admit the quality of the food. Besides the tasty food, we like this place because of that very same fact that we have a place to sit and talk for long time. They don't rush us out.  About the food, we love the fajita, the stake and fish combo, and the rib. Beware, don't eat a lot. Leave some room for the desert. The molten cake with moist chocolate is our favorite. One is sufficient for two people. Recommended place and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edinburg
Mandy O.,"Edinburg, TX",0,21,12,2.0,10/26/2014,"We went late (around 8:00) so we expected a delay. We were seated immediately and our waitress took our drink order very quickly. We were not ready to order so we asked for a few minutes. She didn't come back for over 30 minutes. I wanted to just walk out, but my husband was worried it was too late to find anywhere else to eat. Our food took a while to arrive. While we were waiting our waitress brought out chips and salsa and admitted it was taking a long time for our order. The chips were very salty, but we wiped each chip with a napkin, so most of the salt fell off. When she brought out our appetizer, she did not bring out additional chips for it, so we ended up eating very little of it. She warned it was hot out of the oven, it wasn't the cheese was already getting think and hard to scoop out. Our food was okay, but after watching the table next to us call for the waiter to remove what appeared to be a roach running across the top of the booth, I wasn't in much of a mood to eat. At least the manager came over to talk to them and the waiter jumped over and smashed it with a napkin. We received very few drink refills, very poor service. Our bill was wrong, we were charged for a mixed drink we did not order and my food was not listed on the bill. We knew we were being under charged when all was said and done, but we still notified the waitress. The new machine on the table used to pay your bill was dirty, looked like kids had been playing with it. Our table was dirty as well. We didn't complain, it wouldn't have done any good and I don't know what they would have done to our food. The waitress received the smallest tip I think I have ever left, way less than 20%.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edinburg
