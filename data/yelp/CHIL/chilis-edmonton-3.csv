Kristin K.,"Edmonton, Canada",518,1215,7576,4.0,4/2/2016,"Considering this is Edmonton airport food, I was pretty impressed at two large breakfast tacos & fruit salad for $10. I've spent way more and gotten way less. I would def recommend this item and will likely order it again. It was plenty for the hubs and I to share while waiting for our flight!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Dana C.,"St. Albert, Canada",146,414,221,2.0,7/4/2017,"I always forget that I don't enjoy the breakfast here.... so year after year, I go back.  I really hope I remember next year.  They use chorizo sausage in the breakfast sandwich, which is way too dry.  I have to put ketchup on it, which I *NEVER* do. The potatoes are good... they're the only part I enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Gary M.,"Brampton, Canada",14,365,248,2.0,6/20/2017,This place inside the Edmonton airport is a great example of the worse kind of chain restaurant. A captive business traveler with few options in which to eat!  This place is somewhat run down & so is the food quality. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Fingers on a Waffle. I also asked for Onion Rings instead of fries in which they charged me an extra $2.00. I don't mind paying for food quality as long as the location delivers on what it promised. This location DID NOT DO THAT.  My food was luke warm & although it looked good it sure didn't TASTE good. The waffles were WAY too sweet & the onion rings were simply tasteless. And as I said....the food was borderline cold.  To the credit of the manager she did give me a small credit of about 25% but she didn't seem too concerned.  There are other places in the airport so try them before & this place....try it last!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Basia S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",27,81,157,1.0,4/3/2017,"For an airport, you would expect quick and friendly service. Our server had NO interest in serving us or even talking to us when she brought the food and bill (yes... those were the only two times she came to the table after we sat down and flagged someone else to take our orders). I guess serving 4 women at the same table wouldn't yield as high tips as serving the business men in suits. We are just as willing to tip for good service since we claim our travel and food expenses.  We all left without having more than one drink (couldn't get any service or our bill to get to our gate quickly) and NO TIP!  I fly to Edmonton at many times a year for work and needless to say, I will NEVER come back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Gino B.,"Vancouver, Canada",289,187,1782,4.0,3/19/2015,"Unlike its American counterpart; the Canadian Chiii's locations are more sophisticated and don't play the ""how low can you go"" cheap food formula.  The menu is slightly different and is almost double the price for what they would charge in America and the quality is equally better.  I was surprised to see it in fast casual kiosk format with friendly, accommodating staff at the US  departure gates at YEG. Ordered a low carb chicken fajita bowl with no tortilla chips, no sour cream and no rice, extra vegetables and steak.  They gave me a number and directed me to the food court table area where a few minutes later, a porcelain bowl came with my meal.  Excellent presentation and very yummy, will definitely save my appetite to order here again whenever I come through!  Well, it's Time to Board...Au revoir!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Bernice G.,"Edmonton, Canada",89,164,455,2.0,1/4/2016,"I was at the airport bright and early and decided to order some breakfast here. They have an extensive breakfast menu that appealed to my friend and I.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich and my friend ordered the eggs benny. Both came with grilled potatoes. The potatoes were good although very few on the plate. My sandwich, unfortunately, was a disappointment since the middle of the sausage was under cooked and I ate some of it before realizing it. I never got sick from it but the experience made my stomach turn. My friend did enjoy her eggs benny though. I guess I just wasn't lucky. I did let the staff know that the sausage was under cooked and they did offer to make me a new one but I would have rather got my money back. Oh well... I will not be coming here again when I am at the airport next.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Ben G.,"Toronto, Canada",27,12,1,5.0,1/2/2017,"Let me begin by saying i have eaten in some of the best restaurants in Europe and North America, including several Michelin-star restaurants. I can honestly say that Chili's can kick it w the best of them. Boneless wings were so good i thought the flavourking Fieri personally cooked those babies up. Shoutout chilis xoxo ben",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Boris H.,"Seattle, WA",7,97,69,5.0,5/5/2016,Had a yummy guacamole burger. What a great pre-flight meal. This place has all what you expect from an airport restaurant: easy to order and fast delivery.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Vivian A.,"Arvada, CO",859,881,1836,3.0,4/5/2014,"We were lookin' for a place to sit and eat and The Canadian picked Chili's. We found a tight spot that could fit us and the little one in her travel stroller/chair. Michelle was our waitress and she was super nice and attentive, even though the food (my salad) took a bit longer than expected to come out. What I swallowed: BONELESS BUFFALO CHICKEN SALAD: The chicken was hot and crispy, the lettuce was cold and crisp. I was really enjoying out seats by the window, my great salad, and our little quiet time before we boarded the plane.  And then I saw it.. ... a hair.  Ew.  I couldn't eat anymore. Michelle came by and asked if everything was alright being that my salad was barely touched. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it since we were about to board our plane. I pointed out the hair and she apologized profusely. She asked if there was something that could replace it but I told her not worry since we were about to board and we didn't have much time. The Canadian finished his meal (a pre-made tuna sandwich) and when it was time to leave, Michelle told us the entire bill was taken care of. Mistakes happen. We all learn. Given the circumstances, they did what was best to alleviate the situation. That is great customer service right there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Parisa H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1077,62,68,4.0,12/19/2015,"Great food, quite location. Love the floor manager, she checked on us multiple times. The server who brought us our food was more cheery than the one taking our orders and serving us. The only reason I did not give this place a five star review is our server lack of attitude. If only she was not in rush and had a bit more cheery attitude, they would get my 5 star review. But I will come for food here anytime. Yummy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Natasha S.,"Kitchener, Canada",55,4,2,5.0,7/17/2016,Chili's is great. This was my first Chili's experience. I'm from Toronto. You just don't get this kind of service in Toronto. The staff is very on top of getting me continuous margaritas so I love them. The food is inexpensive and delicious and the service is so fast. Our server Stephanie was the bomb! She was very accommodating to our every need. Go Chili's!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Teena D.,"Toronto, Canada",4,1127,12695,2.0,11/2/2012,"I conducted an enrolment seminar this morning and then scampered to the airport to catch my 1pm flight home. I had a quick lunch at Chili's.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich with no lettuce (I hate lettuce!).  It came with lettuce so I pointed it out to my server.   She took it away and it came back lettuce-free.  Yay! It looked like it was dripping with sauce. Well, it wasn't.  It seemed like the sauce was just on one half ... the other half was dry.  No doubt the cook took a lot of the sauce off when he/she took the lettuce off but didn't replenish it.  It was okay, not great.  But it was better than buying food on the plane.  I had four hour flight and would be starving had I not eaten first. My server was friendly and quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
China D.,"Newark, NJ",77,141,199,3.0,9/7/2015,Good choice for airport breakfast. Food was fresh and came out quickly!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Abby S.,"Denver, CO",3797,2017,5538,3.0,12/20/2013,"In terms of airport restaurants, Chili's isn't so bad. Is it somewhere I'd visit in the ""outside world""? Probably not. But there aren't THAT many choices and it's not a huge roll of the dice. Translation: You know what you're gonna get. Because we were in Canada, the servers were way nice. And because we were in an airport, our  waitress was especially concerned with getting us our food as quickly as possible.  It was Saturday night, so I had a frozen margarita/draught beer combo. It was two things I love combined into one alcoholic beverage. Gotta give Chili's props for finding delicious ways to give us cirrhosis of the liver and/or heart disease. As long as you're enjoying these dangerously delicious treats every so often, it's probably fine. And to offset the bad, I had a buffalo chicken salad. With lots of Ranch dressing! The one thing I love about Chili's/Applebee's/TGI Friday's is there ability to take the bones out of a buffalo chicken wing. It's magic, I tell you! Pure magic.  Total bill for two diners (with one bevy) was less than $50. Again, by airport standards, this was pretty good. Overall, our experience was a pleasant one. Have had WAY worse meals while waiting to catch a plane.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Robert B.,"Surrey, Canada",24,275,529,3.0,12/7/2012,"Well, I have never been much of a chili's fan although I have eaten at various airport locations here and there over the years. However!!!!! They have somewhat recently come out with a new BBQ sauce that is worth ordering something to slather it on... Be that chicken, ribs, fries, burgers, or even the drink coaster... Anything with this stuff on it is like crack! It's called - Shiner Bock BBQ - sauce.. My favourite is the boneless wings with it, but I would eat the napkins with this stuff on it. Totally addictive!! I googled the recipe and it turns out the lady that invented it has posted it on the net.. Wow, how convenient! Saves me spending all my money there... Her name is Cammie Spillyards.. Way to go Cammie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Don B.,"Portland, OR",2952,2308,1642,3.0,5/26/2011,"It's a Chili's. Have you ever been to a Chili's? If you haven't, well, I don't know what to say. It's corporate tex-mex food... especially the airport locations. But show me an airport that doesn't have something even halfway decent food-wise and I'll show you... PDX. Ha! Seriously tho, what makes this Chili's better than your average is that they stock this brand of Tequila I've only seen in Mexico - Herencia De La Plata. Holy shit that's some good Tequila. And I find it for the first time outside of Mexico at, of all places, a Chili's in Edmonton International Airport? Go figure.  Friendly staff and fast service will get you in and out quickly. A couple of stars for that goodness and another for the special tequila and that makes this airport watering hole A-OK in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Paul S.,"Edmonton, Canada",138,280,2175,3.0,12/20/2013,"We don't go to Chili's often but we had some time before our plane so we decided to stop in for a quick bite and drink.  Going through security can be a stressful experience! It's a nice little version of Chili's.  We just had a beer, a wine, and some spinach and artichoke dip with chips.  It was actually very good chips and dip, I would definitely go back to any Chili's for more of those. The staff were friendly and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Scott P.,"Los Altos, CA",173,727,511,2.0,11/28/2013,"I ordered my tiny fajita rice bowl to go. Almost made it on to my flight without any utensils. Had to run back and grab a fork. Not cool. Decent food, portion small, service average minus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Joe D.,"Winnipeg, Canada",0,62,11,5.0,8/6/2015,The servers were very friendly.  Very fast service I ordered the classic breakfast and it was soooo good.  I was in a bad mood because I was delayed 8 hours and they cheered me up  I hope to come back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Garry S.,"Edmonton, Canada",7,64,13,4.0,7/3/2014,Ok nothing amazing here. However when waiting for your flight in the morning you can get a decent breakfast and they do have a licensed area for drinks. Options in this area of yeg airport is limited so they certainly win. The food and selection will surprise you for what is really pseudo fast food. Enjoy and enjoy your travels!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3
Wesley W.,"Vancouver, Canada",78,352,416,2.0,4/12/2013,"This place must be rolling in the money. The amount they charge and the small portion size is pretty much robbery. I understand it's an airport restaurant and everything is jacked up in price but at least make the portions so it resembles a full meal. On the other hand I've been to the new Chili's Express on the international side and compared to here it's cheaper, has larger portions and better quality. No joke when I was at the Chili's Express a guy went out of his way to get the attention of the chef to say his meal was awesome and to keep up the great work. I'll stay away from this one at the domestic terminal though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3?start=20
Janine R.,"Calgary, Canada",174,644,160,2.0,4/24/2013,"Wow could they please have slower service. I assumed it would be quick since it was in an airport and all. Generally people in airports are in a rush to catch their plane.  After we finally flagged down a server we ordered food and drinks. Our Quesadillas were average but I guess what do you expect from a Chili's? Although it did come with this weird sauce a sort of sour cream replacement... not a fan.  The tables and chairs were so close together I could barely slide in to sit down.  Their only saving grace was their Bellini. It was very tasty and I thought it was reasonably priced until I saw how small it was. Sigh, airport food. I guess there isn't a ton of other choice.

Rick C.,"Port Charlotte, FL",0,29,1,4.0,3/3/2014,"Stopped for breakfast on the way out of town last Friday morning, very good for a chain.  We asked someone working at the airport what he recommended, this was it.  I was pleasantly surprised. Service was good, but like so many places tables and chairs are jammed in and people had their luggage scattered all over, blocking aisles and pathways.  I cut through the back of the bar on my way out.  Prices pretty decent for an airport location. The food is what made this place worth while.  I had fruit, yogurt and granola, very tasty.  The fruit was large pieces that appeared to be cut on site.  Not just melon, but pineapple and berries, a good mix and a good amount.  My partner had an omelet, very tasty, not something poured out of a carton.   Overall, very happy with the quantity and quality of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3?start=20

André D.,"Toronto, Canada",30,159,7,2.0,12/19/2010,"The day I left to head home for the holidays, I wanted to leave early to deal with the crappy snow covered unsafe roads that Edmonton has.  So I decided I would drop my rental off and figure out what to have for breakfast.  Right by gate 52, where I was to board my plane was Chili's.  I hadn't been there since my LA days and said what the heck. I ordered just a classic breakfast which consisted of 2 scrambled eggs, 2 sausages, 2 square shaped pancakes and these small hash browns with a strawberry lemonade as my beverage.  Well the strawberry lemonade isn't as tasty as the one you get from Red Robin.  The food took quite a while to come to my table and what for?  It wasn't that busy at 9 AM on a Thursday.  In reality the pancakes came separately because they weren't ready as the rest of my order.  They were blaring some dance music from Galaxie which wasn't what I wanted to hear, especially with my driving experience.   The food was ok for what it was worth.  Don't know if I'd ever want to go there again.  Either I'll eat breakfast before or choose another place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edmonton-3?start=20
