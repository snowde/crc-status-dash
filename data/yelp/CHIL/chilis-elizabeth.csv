Tony A.,"Sacramento, CA",1194,606,2198,3.0,12/27/2017,"I'm NOT a huge fan of the ""corporate machine"" chains like Chili's but, I am a fan of keeping my family happy.  So while walking around The Mills at Jersey Gardens shopping center and the family wanted to eat; here I am. The date is December 26, 2017.  One day after Xmas and EVERYONE living in and around Jersey is here to catch the sales or exchange a gift.  Theres a line for every eatery inside the mall, including Chili's.  But to their credit, we didn't have to wait for a table of five.  Right in and to our seats but, that's where the CUDOS stop.   The wait for our initial server was about five minutes.  We placed drink orders and away she went.  Where??  I don't have a clue.  Ten minutes later, two of our five drinks arrived.  The rest arrived about five minutes later.   After the drinks arrived, we asked questions about the menu items and placed our orders for an appetizer and our meals. ** NOTE **   According to my family who seem to have visited Chili's ether often or are in the know how things work told me when guacamole is ordered, its normally prepared table side.  Not ours.  It arrived table side already mixed.  I did notice the table next to ours had ordered the guacamole and their server was working hard preparing theres at their table.   Normally when we dine out.  We're still in the middle of our appetizers when the main dish comes out.  NOT so today.  In fact, our server had to bring out more chips and apologized for the long delay with our meals. About twenty five minutes past and our server arrived saying she had bad news.  ""Our cooks didn't expect the large crowd today and they ran out of the batter for the waffles.""  She then asked if my son and I wanted to order something else from the menu which she just happened to have in her hand when I asked to see the menu again.  Things that make you say ""hum."" Almost an hour since our arrival and all of food made it to the table.  The buffalo chicken sandwich I ordered was mediocre okay.  Eatable but nothing to brag about. Final thoughts... I think this Chili's has an awesome location and has the potential to do and have a great business.  But, those running the establishment need to pay attention to the patrons concerns, wishes and reviews.  Service is slow and comes with excuses.  Attitude reflects leadership.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth
Andy Z.,"Union, NJ",0,46,6,1.0,12/20/2017,Awful awful service. Waited 10 minutes at the bar for a drink!! Food took over half an hour!! Really really bad. Unprofessional bartender sagging his pants and pulling them up every 30 seconds.  Bad experience all together.  I actually saw 6 people leave because they waited too long for service.

Rodrigo T.,"Lincoln Park, MI",323,792,2219,4.0,3/10/2017,"What can I say about this Chili's spot. Uh,,, it's not your regular Chili's joint. They're not gonna have your regular Chili's stuff... like the house margarita. That's not available. We did come in because we were picking up friends at Liberty. So what better place to kill time than to do it at a spot where you can have a few drinks and food food then walk it off by spending money at the shops. We had two presidential margaritas, which was pretty good. Then we had an order of their sampler platter to share. The food and the booze was a perfect pair. Everything was definitely perfect as anything.  The place was nice and clean. We ate and drank at the bar and the bar tender was definitely attentive. Awesome service,, 10 out of 10. No drama,,, and would definitely eat here again.  Thank you for reading my review. I hope this helps. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth
Danny T.,"Issaquah, WA",46,4,,1.0,12/5/2017,"Poor service.  We waited 15 minutes and the table next to us waited over 20. Asked to speak to a manager and she took our order but that took another 20 minutes.  Food came out and our server appeared angry we were bothering her.  Our server came by once after that to see if everything was good.   Never saw her again.  No silverware, no refills, no nothing.   Went back to the manager to get our bill and we got our chips and salsa taken off the bill. Almost missed our flight because of the poor service!  Not recommended at all!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth
Tracy N.,"East New York, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,1,1.0,11/11/2017,I will never eat from here neither will I recommend someone to eat there...they got terrible service I got fruit fly in my margarita and they didn't even apologize they jus asked if I wanted a different drink and to top that of my waiter got my whole order wrong..that place is horrible,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth

Austin C.,"Kenilworth, NJ",0,3,,1.0,11/29/2017,"Came to this place right after I got out of work, was seated within 10 seconds of entering. Employees yelling at each other to mop floors very poor resturant service. I ordered a half rack of ribs with French fires I told the waitress that I wanted the ""dry rub"" on the ribs because I have acid reflex and I can't have BBQ sauce without having incredible amount of pain in my chest. What do I get? A half rack of ribs loaded with BBQ sauce and cold hard French fries which took a hour to come out to me, I waited for almost 30mins and no one was around for me to say anything about the error, so I took napkins and wiped the bbq sauce off as best as possible. Never will I ever come back here, this place should be shut down asap",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth
Joshua B.,"Moyock, NC",117,195,233,1.0,9/12/2016,"My group came by because it's close to wear we are staying. We arrived and seated ourselves in the bar area. After a medium wait (10 minutes), a waitress came by to take our order. We gave drink orders, and she left. Then a waiter came by and introduced himself and said he would be our waiter. We asked about the first person then they began to argue who was taking our order. After an interesting show we got the waiter and our friends got the waitress. I ordered the salad bar however my friends had a terrible experience. Their food was cold, drink glasses remained on the tables and no garlic cheese rolls made it a bad time. Not recommended at all.

Wai W.,"Waldwick, NJ",119,448,203,4.0,1/2/2017,"There are very few sit down eateries in Jersey Garden other than the food court.  If you want full sit down meal, this is one of those available. It is large to accommodate bigger parties and has a bar to boot.  Service is very attentive as well as anticipating refilling your drinks. Food is realitvely good especially the fajitas and burgers.  Typical Chillis you can come to expect but get here early for no wait seating since the mall packs a huge crowd for lunch and dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth
Mandy C.,"Winthrop, ME",24,70,88,1.0,8/11/2016,"Just came from a ridiculous meal at Chilis. 1st off, my husband and I both ordered their ""20"" oz Stella after a looooong drive from Maine. Well, their 40cl Stella glass with a solid 1+"" head is not 20 oz! After doing a quick online search, it was easily established that 40cl is 13.526 us fluid ounces! (The bar tried to convince us that this was in fact the 20oz glass. It has been well disputed that this glass is not.) When my husband brought this to the manager's attention he a) refused to tell my husband how much the 14 oz beer was so that we could get the difference taken off our bill, and b) he offered to take 10% off the cost of each beer?! That came to a whopping $2 and some change off the entire bill. All the while, he agreed that it wasn't right and proceeded to throw the bartender under the bus. I will be reporting this restaurant to the state liquor agency for them to look into this issue.  2ndly, my husband and I ordered the ""classic nachos"" to share. (Nachos were not pictured or labeled in the menu) When I hear ""classic nachos"" I expect classic nachos. I expect a pile of tortilla chips with all of the accompaniments. Plus, we even threw in the guacamole for the buck and three quarters up charge. (No mention from the waitress that the ""classic nachos"" might not be as share-worthy as we were anticipating.) well, we literally got nachos-on-the-half-shell. There were 12 tortillas with the toppings stacked on top of them an a melon-ball's worth of quac in the middle.  Do Not Waste Your Time Here!  This particular restaurant relies on one time shoppers who come here for convenience. They feel no need to have ethics, scruples, or service. They don't expect to see you again, so why bother!  Go to any other spot for food in the mall. Starve this Chilis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth

Aditi G.,"Jersey City, NJ",38,99,100,2.0,11/12/2016,The worst part about this mall is the horrible good. Even chains like Chilis are bad. Service is painfully slow and below par. Our server came after pleading for 10 minutes. Out table only had 1 set of cutlery for 2 people. The server got us wrong order but realized it without us telling him (thank you!).

Krishnan S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",32,10,5,1.0,11/27/2016,"Wish I could give negative stars....this place sucks big time. These people have no ethics and no respect for the customer and that includes the Manager who has zero customer service skills. We ordered from the kids menu and it came out looking like this mutilates sandwich. I'd prepare a better looking one for my dog! The fries clearly were re-fried and old. We also ordered the combo entree 2 for $20, well the portions were lesser than an appetizer. We called the manager to send it back and she had no Empathy instead she took it and said you will need to wait  a while for a replacement.  They take the shoppers for granted and that's why they are still here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth
Ju M.,"Paterson, NJ",51,1,,1.0,6/30/2017,The service in this place is the worst! They take forever to take your order. They NEVERRR answer the phone.

I went in there with my family, I was given a table however for 25 minutes no body came to take the orders. I would have excused them if the restaurant would have been busy but it was 60% occupied at max. After 25 minutes we decided to move out and nobody cared about it. I would suggest a very big NO for this restaurant if you are in this mall and would like to have food, the food court has better options and quick service.

Wai K.,"Queens, NY",79,83,113,1.0,1/4/2017,"Just another major chain restaurant. This Chili is nice and clean and food is decent. Was not thrilled with the staff and service. It took awhile for someone to come and take our order. When our orders arrived, the burger we asked for was incorrectly made. We asked for the egg in the burger to be fried and it came sunny side up. When we let the server know he said the egg could not be fried - then why didn't you tell us when we first made the order ???? Finally he took it back to the kitchen and basically what they did is just put the same egg on the stove and cooked it some more. Oh well - it's a chain restaurant- we really shouldn't expect much I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth
Eugene O.,"New York, NY",405,428,1582,4.0,10/26/2014,Came here after the movies with the kids and also to watch the football game which they already started playing on all their TVs. We were seated right away.  The waiter came within minutes and took our order.  He didn't use any electronics or pen and paper to write down our orders which were not that easy.  To my surprise he has gotten everything right.  Food arrived quickly as well as drinks and he has kept on checking up on us very often clearing the table from unneeded items and bringing us more drinks refills and other things like ketchup.

Johanna G.,"Jersey City, NJ",204,11,9,2.0,1/14/2017,"My girlfriend and I ordered the table side guacamole, it came with a huge bowl of chips and salsa, we usually love guac and we barely touched this one, it was drenched in lime juice and the avocado CLEARLY was not ripe enough. I ordered the prime rib tacos, it came with rice and a side of beans (although a little salty for my taste, the beans were best part of the meal) the tacos were mediocre, will never order them again. She had the seared shrimp with grilled chicken combo with corn on the cob and broccoli on the side (it was alright).

No one in our party was content with the quality, freshness, or taste of what they ordered. Everything seemed so dry and tasteless.  Service: Service was also very much lacking. In general, you could see waiters and personnel just hanging around and slow-paced. Every time you looked up there seemed to be a cluster of 3-5 waiters just  talking amongst themselves.

First, there were 7 of us in the group. She took all of our orders by memory and repeated back to us what we ordered!! Including our various drinks. Who does that anymore?? Ida, that's who!!

Ashley C.,"Edison, NJ",379,38,129,1.0,8/15/2014,"To be honest, I do not want to give this restaurant any stars. Although I am not a fan of any chain restaurants, if I had to choose one on the fly it would be Chili's (probably because it was always conveniently located near my house). My friends know I frequent this chain, and therefore when celebratory occasions occur, they get me gift certificates. Shopping at the Jersey Gardens Mall with my girlfriend, I decided why not treat her for lunch at that Chili's location. This specific location and experience has forever changed my outlook and opinion on the Chili's establishments.  First off, let me just say, had I visited the rest room PRIOR to BARELY eating my BLAND lunch, I would have NEVER ordered anything at this restaurant. The bathroom reminded me of porter potties that have been sitting at a carnival for months. It stunk, was filthy, and soap was limited. They cannot keep their bathroom clean, so what would make me think their kitchen is any cleaner? Secondly, the food lacked flavor, and was cold when served. The salad I ordered was wilted and gross. Since I was myself a server, I am not the type to send back my food nor blame the server for the quality of my food. Instead, I pay, leave, and inform the public about how horrible their experience will be if they ever choose to visit this establishment.  Lastly, my friend and I were one of 3 tables in that place during lunch (which probably should have been a sign from the very beginning). I accidentally left a folder with personal papers on the table upon leaving the restaurant. But FIRST we used the restroom. Therefore, staff had already began cleaning our table while we were STILL in the restaurant. Did they approach me  to tell me that I left something? Absolutely not. I realized when I got to my car, I forgot it, called immediately, and they informed me they found NOTHING. Those were personal items I will never be able to reproduce so you can imagine how disappointed I am in myself (for forgetting) and this establishment (for their dishonesty).  Thus, because of my poor experience, I will NEVER return to this Chili's establishment again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth?start=20

Ruined our day especially my daughters meal. After that our other meals didnt look appealing much! Honestly we were done - our stomachs turned! I told our waiter who apologized on his behalf and said he would take care of it. Well he called the manager who approached us and said he would take it off the bill and if we would like something else. My daughter said thank you but she's fine and did not want anything ( seriously after what she saw). Now when the bill arrived personally by the manager it still had the meal on it. HE only took 10% off. I asked the manager to come back at our table to explain ""why"" 10% ....he took the bill back returned to our table & slammed the bill in front of me again and then left!!!! It was only changed it to 15% my point this whole thing Totaling was appalling!!!They should be reported to the NJ Department of Health- not sanitary at all! I should of just walked out but didnt want to make a bigger scene in front of my family and the restaurant  so I ended up paying the bill leaving no tip, which is still not right.

He stated it wasn't our child and he was calling the police. We told him to go right ahead and we asked for a manager. We explained the situation and moved to a different area. The man was allowed to stay at the bar, although clearly intoxicated. We decided to close our tab and finish our drink. As we were about to walk out, he jumped out of his seat and chased us to the door, as if reaching for our little girl. It was terrifying to her and so upsetting.

Miran C.,"San Francisco, CA",272,575,200,2.0,4/4/2011,"I am a ""shrug, it's a chain"" diner when it comes to TGI, Applebee, etc. But a normal Chili's is surprisingly flavorful with huuuge portions THIS location is actually a Chili's To Go.  Bascially, this is a half-arse, Poor Man's version of a real Chili's with no price difference to speak out! The menu is abbreviated and includes some selections from a normal Chili's, but there is a big quality difference between Chili's and Chili's To Go. At a normal Chili's, the Chicken Margarita is a dish comprised of 2 chicken breasts that are juicy, grilled, and flavorful.  The black beans are like those served in a stand alone Mexican restaurant and the rice with tortilla strips and pico de gallo is complementary.   At To Go, it was a meagre version with dry chicken, blah rice, and very runny and unenhanced canned beans.     It should cost $5.

Our host sat us a table that was clearly dirty as it was ""flagged"" with a ketchup bottle, meaning in our industry the table needs to be wiped.

There is NO WAY I could ever reccomend this place, even to someone I didn't care to much for! This is a ""Chili's Too"" so it carries the brand name but with a limited menu that like others have said, is not of the same quality by any means!

We ordered drinks, and appetizer, soups and salads and dinner.    We never saw anyone again....About 20 minutes later a NASTY and I do emphasize NASTY bowl of soup came out for me..where was my husbands? Then our drinks....then nothing. No one even looked at us to see if we were ok. All the while workers were cleaning tables with windex that was flying all in the air, you could tase it in your mouth and everyone was complaining....yet it continued.  About 20 minutes after that, our dinner came out, with a side salad that was now given to my husband, but what happened to the appetizer? Our new waiter explained that our old waiter never told him about it ?????? What? I asked about the soup/ salad screw up and he was totally confused...So I just asked for a refill on my soda.....no one ever came back! After ten minutes I finally got up and approached a hostess, asking them for soda b/c no one else was around. Ten minutes later, they brought me one. After all of this nonsense, we simply asked for the bill and wanted to get out of there. In th meantime, people at the tables on either side of us both complained of mixed up or forgotten orders...ridiculous! The bill was a MESS, there were all sorts of things that they never served us but were attempting to charge us for. The appetizer that was once forgotten, was now appearing on our bill...seriously?! So after that was squared away, I approached the manager who looked like a deer in the headlights...She simply said ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience"" and handed me free chips and salsa coupons for when I COME BACK?!
