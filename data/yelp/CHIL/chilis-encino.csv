Irene B.,"Encino, CA",69,150,229,3.0,12/8/2017,"Just a Chili's. The decor is much modern than a couple years back, which really attacks the younger crowds!  Still with all TV's powering any type of sports you might like! We had a beer and the President Margarita. ~$17/for both.  The Margarita was very tasty. I could taste the perfect amount of Tequila!  We ordered the frech fries with cheese and bacon (small $5). It was definitely not good, the fries were so dry like if they were cooked the day before.  Bottom line, you know what you are going to get at a Chili's. I will be back for the next cool sport event but that's kind of it.  Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino
Suzy H.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,161,36,2.0,12/27/2017,"First off, the short sticky manager with no name tag is an ass to his employees. My daughter, my grandson and I were her today to have a late lunch. My grandson was hungry and tired and threw his apple juice on the floor (he's 22 months old). I went and told the host , who was an absolute amazing person and very helpful, about it. He came over and mopped the spill up and brought another apple juice. The Mgr. Then came over and made the guy get rags, get down on the floor practically and dry it up all the while giving us a dirty look. Excuse me, but I'm paying your salary. Anyway, we had tacos and the new honey chipotle boneless wings. The tacos were good. Stick with original boneless wings if you're going to order the wings. The honey chipotle wings weren't that good. The molten lava cake and the coffee were delish. The manager definitely needs some training. I might be back but not soon. The ambiance has completely changed from 6 months ago. It just wasn't enjoyable. Waited a year before I came back with my daughter and grandson again. Service still crappy. Food wasn't hot except for the chili. Kids small meal of sliders & corn on the cob was near cold and corn tasted old. They forgot the fries but once I told the waitress she brought them-cold. Molten lava cake was good. It still wasn't enjoyable and the whole place had 4 people eating there. So my daughter loves the nachos and so, we went back. This time it took around 20-25 minutes for the food to arrive. Bleh still. There was 1 waitress running around for 9 tables!!! Asked for the check because zooksk wasn't working... received wrong check, then it took another 20 minutes to receive the correct check. My daughter missed her dance class because it took an hour and a half for lunch. Hopefully I've learned my lesson and will NOT go back!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino
Elizabeth Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,66,132,4.0,11/26/2017,My coworkers and me stumbled across this Chili's to kill some time. Turned out becoming one of our go to spots for happy hour on Wednesdays. Not too bad of a place!  The food? Decent for happy hour prices. We usually order the chips and guac and an order of boneless wings.  Drinks? I stick with beer. But I've heard their margaritas are good too.  Service? 90% of the time our servers have been super cool and nice. I won't complain!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino
Alan B.,"La Jolla Shores, San Diego, CA",265,814,3204,1.0,9/5/2017,Awful! This was my first time ever at a Chili's Restaurant. I had some friends who live in the area wanted to meet for happy hour. So I said sure. As I time to spare I was going back home to SD. After parking we decided to seat at the bar area. Nobody even greeted us to say hello and welcome. So we sat the bar area. 20 minutes goes by nobody coming to ask us for are drink orders or we had any questions on the menu. As it was happy hour time.  I noticed the happy hour menu. As we never got a chance to even get a glass of water.  So I said give another 5 minutes before I am leaving. Sure enough I gave it another 10 minutes. Nobody came over to take are drink or food order. At that point I just walked out and refuse to talk to a manager. When one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.  You have large private lot parking and street parking.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino
David P.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",20,138,115,3.0,10/9/2017,"I used to like this Chili's better than the one in Northridge. Unfortunately, my experience yesterday ruined that perception. I walked in and there was no host or hostess to be found. I stood there looking at all the available tables thinking I would be seated right away if anyone ever showed up to seat me. The host finally showed up and said there would be a fifteen minute wait. I looked at all the empty tables and wondered why there was a wait. There were several small booths right in front perfect for a party of one. When I was finally seated I looked around the restaurant. Tables were full of plates and glasses that had yet to be cleared after the previous customers had left. The restaurant is apparently understaffed. Somebody needs to hire a busser or two to clean off tables. Chili's recently removed a large number of items from their menu. Gone is one of my favorites, the steak and shrimp with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes. All I ever had to do was substitute broccoli for the mashed potatoes and I was in low carb heaven. I realize the menu was getting too big and they wanted to simplify it but this was a disappointment for me. Except for the fajitas the menu is absent of shrimp. Anyway I ordered a smokehouse combo. Served on a metal tray the combo is offered with two or three meat selections, chili garlic bread, fries, roasted street corn, and pickles. Sure it ruined my low carb diet but their was plenty of protein. I chose the chicken crispers, jalapeno cheddar sausage, and BBQ chicken breast. The fourth option is a half rack of ribs for $2.00 extra. The fries were hot and crispy and flavorful. The chili garlic bread was good as was the street corn. I liked the sausage as the jalapenos were mild and didn't burn my mouth. The chicken crispers weren't very crispy and looked more like chicken tenders  from the kids menu than they did in the photo on the menu. The BBQ chicken breast was a good size but I was full and took it home for a later meal. The staff were running around doing there best to please the customers and were friendly and as attentive as they could be under the circumstances. I was miffed that the Ziosk table entertainment system was not working at my table. I always enjoy playing the trivia game. I was even more miffed when a $1.99 table entertainment charge was added to my bill. This was quickly removed by the server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino
Ben S.,"Glendale, CA",516,19,2,5.0,11/26/2017,"I have been to Chili's all over the country, this is by far the best in America! Katrina was the best server I've ever had ever! She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and have the greatest Chilis experience ever!

Mike M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1821,1382,381,2.0,10/30/2017,"Why bother.... because we wanted a lace with TVs to watch the game and no wait. Marginal food, marginal service....All the trappings of a huge corporate chain. No prices on the drink menu? Who does that? When will these place learn that the crappy kiosks that they place on the table take up too much room and never properly work? Dennys, TGIFridays and Chili's use these to ""speed up"" service. Wrong.

Lily G.,"Van Nuys, CA",30,113,151,5.0,9/1/2017,"We always come here if we are in the mood for good food with decent prices and yummy drinks. Their baby back ribs are delicious , I don't know if they still have the Dr. Pepper sauce but it's sooo gooood!!  Their cocktails are really well made at this location , especially margaritas. My favorites have been the triple Berry and their seasonal watermelon margarita , super tasty! The 2 for $22 deal is pretty good , usually my wife and I don't get it because she likes different things on the menu lol but it's a great deal!  I would definitely recommend this place , the wait usually isn't long , except for Friday and Saturday nights due to the dinner rush .  Worth checking out !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino
SarahJane G.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,61,24,2.0,11/5/2017,2 stars because the 2 for 22 was a good deal. Other than that it was a disappointment .Waitress never returned with the lemon for our water nor did she return to ask if we needed more drinks. I had to flag her down for napkins and she didn't return with them until we were done with our meal. Before she scurried away I asked for our check. She looked at me sideways and pointed at the little kiosk at the end of the day as if I'm just supposed to know that's were you pay.  It was an enjoyable time because it was date night but this won't be a spot I will be returning to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino
Sam W.,"Burbank, CA",10,122,8,2.0,10/25/2017,"It's not a gourmet meal by any means but I happen to like Chilis Margaritas and their Southwestern Eggrolls. I used to like going to this location over other locations in the valley but recently I had two really poor experiences here, one last month and another last weekend. Last weekend I went to the Encino location around 12:30. When we arrived we were told by what we thought was the host that there were was nothing available except for one booth in the bar and we would have to eat there. There was no option of waiting for a table in the dining room. We reluctantly sat in the bar and our host is actually a waiter, then it clicked he was trying to fill his section which annoyed me from the start.  After I order a manager comes over and asks us why we sat at that table, I explained that we were told to sit there. Apparently the waiter/host bussed someone's meal while they were in the restroom and not finished. We offered to move tables but they told us to stay and so we had to eat with the other table glaring at us. If that wasn't bad enough the manager seemed to offer no apology when I said this entire experience is making me feel really awkward. Also during the end with our meal the waiter/host and a bartender were having an argument and shouting over our booth. All in all, it was one of the least enjoyable dining experiences I've had in quite a long time. I'll still go to Chilis, but this location is on a time out for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino
Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,549,286,4.0,4/17/2017,"If you've been to one Chili's, you've been to them all, right? I suppose, but customer service always plays a big role in each location. My daughter and I drove down to LA to visit my brother. It was later on a Friday evening, close to 10PM. We checked into the hotel and then decided that we were all hungry. I usually like to venture out to different places when in a new area, but we were hungry and I wanted to go to a place that I knew would be open. I found that Chili's was a few miles away from the hotel and we decided to come here. By the time that we got there, it was only going to be open for another half an hour, so we hurried in. We were seated right away, but luckily there were other people in both the dining room and bar, so we weren't the only people in there. Our waiter came around and took our order. We tried to have our orders ready, so it would take forever since they were closing soon. The food was fine, came out correctly and how we ordered it. Some people like it, others don't. It is saltier than a lot of other restaurants, but it tastes like that at all the other locations. I wish that I could remember our servers name, but he made the experience great. He wasn't pushy about trying to get us out of there right away, even though we came in close to closing. I was thankful for a good meal after being on the road for most of the day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino

Jim F.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,135,38,1.0,8/28/2017,"Ordered their famous ribs and they were disgusting. Clearly sitting in a heating bin all day. The sauce was caked and the meat that wasn't covered in sauce was like jerky.  Would have been 2 stars if they hadn't charged me $2 gaming fee. They plop an ipad down on your table. It lets you order deserts and look at items. There are also crappy little games. We launched a trivia game. AT NO TIME was there a warning of any kind that certain activities on the ipad was billable. It showed up on our bill as a ""gaming fee"". I wasn't going to put up a fuss about a lousy $2 surcharge but if Chilli's has the nerve to charge people like that without telling them, they deserve all the 1 star reviews they can get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino

First impressions for this Chili's location was great. We came Sunday for dinner we don't have to wait. Our server ( Janine)  really nice and professional and the menu is improved, I love the honey Chipotle and waffles and I asked if I can order the waffles only she said no because waffles is special imported from Belgium and the dont have for waffles only in the menu.

Doc S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,38,28,1.0,6/21/2017,"This has to be the worst restaraunt in Encino, California.   The servers and management are dishonest.   I received an email yesterday about a $10 dinner-special, and Chilis Encino has it adversely on Yelp as well. I get there and am told it stopped months ago and now the new special is more with no dessert.   They now say the $10 dinners are 1/3 sized dinners but no Where is it stated.   They charged extra for rice and beans, and both were cold.  The entire dinner was cold and terrible.   Customers who entered 20 minutes after use were services 20 minutes before.  Why?  They did not ask for the special that no one heard of.  Although the booth behind asked for the same menu.  The chicken breast was hard.  The beans and rice were cold and hard with blond hairs. The chip plate was not offered to go.  All we ate was. 2 cups of Coke and 2 cups of ice tea.  When asked how it was in that it was all there said ""terrible"" and response was ""that's good"".  But he did want to make sure about his 20% tip.  What a concept. Don't listen to customer.  When customer tells you about issues just ask for bigger tip.  The food was not edible.

We went back to cash in on a free chicken sandwich that they gave us from a previous bad experience.  BIG MISTAKE. ROTTEN food.  Pictures attached. Wrong order again, unacceptable wait time and absurd customer service. Staff was confused and unable to apply logic. Pictures speak for themselves.  Management INSISTED my husband bring back the rotten food to receive his refund.  He is en route.  Let you know if he actually gets the refund.  Can NOT believe how disgusting this TAKE-OUT order was.  He ordered it on the phone as he drove there so there was not a wait time between ""prep"" and our table.  Shocking how disgusting this food was and how terrible the staff was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino

Robert S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,,1.0,9/29/2016,"Ok so this is crap. I've been stopping by Chilis for years now, drinking large mugs of Stella Artois, and making my contribution to the bartender's rent fund (at least Jordan and Seth, who are totally awesome), and I come in today - no Stella, and it's not coming back. They are replacing with all new ""local"" beers...great.  I don't have anything against the craft and local beer movement, and am happy to see so many more beer choices for people, but c'mon - the taps at Chilis will now be all craft selections, and Bud lite or Coors lite. Maybe they'll have a Mexican brew.  You gotta have already one mass produced, good quality Pilsner or lager, and I'm sorry but Bud lite and Coors lite are not even close to Stella, or Pilsner Urquell, or even a damn Heineken. Why don't we have Carlsberg on US taps, it's all over Europe?!  What about a nice Asahi or Sapporo, or even Kirin?! Or can we have some big bottles or cans? Fosters oil cans would be fine with me.  Shit.   So now I have to (1) go somewhere else or (2) drink Corona by the bottle.  So much for my happy hour - and Chilis, if you had any idea how much money I spend on beer in bars, particularly yours, you'd be putting the Stella back.

Isabella A.,"Studio City, CA",1,18,7,1.0,8/13/2016,"This has to be the worse chilis that I have ever been too. I used to work as a server at chilis many years ago and the customer service has gone way down. The only reason I still eat here is that it's the only one in my area and it's near my job. Every time, and I mean EVERY time, I order to go food here about an hour before I pick it up, it still takes me 30 to 45 minutes to actually get my food after arriving to the restaurant. Even when it's slow. And the worse part is that all the servers see you standing there waiting and they just stare with dumb looks on their face. By the time I get rung up and receive my food I've usually lost my appetite. Sigh, it's partially my fault because I keep going in hopes it'll get better it never does. And good luck to anyone who tries to use their chilis rewards points, the manager (a woman) insisted on arguing with me for 10 minutes before she realized I was correct and that you can use two rewards in one order....

Ernesto V.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,1,1.0,4/12/2017,"Ventura Blvd, Encino CA Very poor service. I placed my order and when out came out it was incorrect. Which is ok, I simply told him what it was supposed to be and he went back to the kitchen to fix it. Came back out and my order was wrong again! I explained to him what I wanted, which was SIMPLE. He then argued with me and was trying to tell me that I ordered something else. His attitude was deplorable as was very disrespectful. I asked for the manager and when he came out he was upset with me as if I did something wrong and asked me ""what's wrong with the order"" with a bad attitude. I told him what I ordered. The manager then tried to clarify what I ordered and it he repeated it incorrectly. At this point I'm wondering if it's me that's the problem. So I opened the menu, pointed at the menu at the pictures and said ""I want that, and this"". The manager got even more annoyed because I did that. He finally said ok. He went to the back and brought my food over, AND IT WAS INCOMPLETE AND WRONG AGAIN! Where is the disconnect? I have no clue, this never happened to me ever. Was this a prank? Tired and hungry, I told him what was missing and what was wrong. Finally those were corrected, fine,  time to eat. I pick up my corn and it's COLD! THEY GAVE ME OLD CORN THAT WAS BEYOND SITTING AROUND IN THE BACK. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO HEAT EMITTING FROM IT! What the heck is this? Then my rice? OH NO, THE SAME THING! I told the manager I was not paying for my food. He then responded with ""ill give you a discount"" like he was doing me a favor, and he said it in a very condescending manner. He repeated to me again that ""I'm gonna give you a discount, ok""? I looked at him like ""whatever"" and was prepared to pay my tab minus a $2 discount I thought he was gonna do for me. He actually didn't charge me for my meal which was honestly a surprise. Meanwhile this whole debacle was occurring our original waiter was walking around literally throwing a plastic tray into the air and spinning it into the air and trying to catch it when it came down. Needless to say, he didn't always catch it and it would just land and slap obnoxiously loud on the floor, the behavior of a 12 year old. I mean it, that waiter behaved so childish. Who plays with objects by throwing them high into the air in the dining area? Had it ever occurred to him that he could walk into someone, like another employee carrying food because he's looking up into the air and not where he's walking? Or it could land on a customer and hurt someone?  I've been coming here for years now and things happen, I get it. Mistakes happen and they get corrected, no biggy. It's cool. But this was down right terrible.  Judging by the way the waiter spoke, unable to listen, and playing in the dining area like a child (which was very very bizarre behaviour for an adult to have at work in front of other people) he's not prepared to work with the public yet, he had the mentality of a child still. The manager? Not very well spoken, sounds uneducated when he talks, doesn't listen well either, poor attitude, and clearly a bad example and leader for his team. What you permit is what you promote. I'm a loyal patron of Chilis and have been for years. I frequent all the time. In fact my friends and family sometimes give me gift cards to Chili's because they know I go there all the time. Sadly, the only Chili's around is the one on Ventura Blvd in Encino. I need to find somewhere else to go, which is sad because I feel like going right now lol. But I can't anymore  If anyone else had a similar experience here please post here. I will be contacting there headquarters as well.  Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=40
Denis C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,10,2,1.0,6/11/2017,"This place, what can i say....EVERYTIME, and i mean EVERY time ive come, they have taken 30 or more mins to serye a TO-GO order placed online 15-20 mins before I even attempt to go there, and when I arrive, its a minimum of another 20 min wait. The online wait time says: no wait, but trust me, there always is. Keep in mind, people are ordering online to make the wait time less due to 30 min lunch breaks, and ive been late to returning to Work EACH time.

Kudos to girl bartender with lot of energy and very friendly while wearing many different hats...the male bartenders really slow.

Zak R.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",31,33,8,5.0,11/26/2016,"I worked at a Chili's years ago while in college and I'm always raving about it to my gf who has never been. I finally took her to Chili's in Encino since it's the closest one to us (GET IT TOGETHER, BURBANK!). The host gave us a very warm greeting and instantly I knew it was going to be a good experience. Erika, our server greeted us quickly, got our drinks and queso to the table promptly and was just all around wonderful. I got the half rack of baby back ribs and my gf got the Bacon Burger. She told us those were two of the options the $22 deal and said she would put it in as such with the queso, which was very nice of her. The food was just as good as I remembered and I had a pure happy nostalgic moment that my gf thought was pretty funny. It's sad that there is not a Chili's close to us, but since there aren't any in NYC where we are from, we will take what we can get.

It feels slightly different in here than what I'm used to, probably cause this is LA, but not different in a good or bad way.

Obviously it's natural for a bathroom to smell weird at times and while that's out of the control of Chili's and most restaurants, it just really bothered me and stressed me out. If I managed this Chili's I would take the initiative to keep an active air freshener in the rest rooms as that would be a nice touch and a strong advantage over your average 3-4 star restaurant that disregards these tiny but important details that can make or break a very comfortable dining experience.

But this Chili's felt different. It felt like the Midwest. And as it's in a shopping center full of d-bags, I was shocked, SHOCKED at the kindness within these walls. I usually go with my friend, since I don't like chains, but the last two times we came here, we were treated with kindness. Maybe it's phony, but...desperate for civility, I'll take it. For example, I only ordered a plate of endless nachos with a bowl of chili (I figured, you go to Chilis gotta eat chili, right?). The server was very peppy and nice. No ""that all you want half-pint? Thanks for wasting my precious time."" No attitude. Just a smile, a serve, and a quick ""enjoy!"" That's straight up customer service. Also, I flagged down someone who we clearly were not their table, asking for more chips. ""No problem""...I thought I'd seen the last of that person. Nope, within a few minutes, a hot plate of chips came out. So fast, even our server didn't realize it. Again, service. I really dig this place. Well trained service (nice). Decent grub. A nice relaxing atmosphere. It's been at least a decade since I've seen little kids dressed up nice to go to a restaurant (says a lot about where I eat).

We picked the fried cheese appetizer along with the Smoky Chipotle Chicken Fajitas and the Roasted Red Pepper Grilled Chicken. My boyfriend also checked in on Foursquare and was able to score free chips and salsa! To drink, he got a mango iced tea, which unfortunately he didn't enjoy too much.  We were seated quickly, we placed our order, and about 15 minutes later, our food arrived! We didn't even have time to complain that our food was missing. My mom and I also ordered an El Nino Margarita. We ordered that a bit later, and that took the most time getting to our table.  The fried cheese (mozzarella sticks, basically) were nice and cheesy! We split that amongst the three of us. By the end of our meal, that was all gone.  My mom loved her spicy chicken fajitas! They had tortillas, guac, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and salsa on the side. Perfect to even out the spice.  I loved loved loved loved the Red Pepper Grilled Chicken. It comes in a red pepper sauce which wasn't too spicy. That came with rice (yum yum) and broccoli (wasn't too good). I can't believe I contemplated against the red pepper chicken.  We finally got the El Nino Margarita. It was good. I normally wouldn't have picked it, but my mom wanted it. Somehow, my boyfriend had room for dessert. For Veterans, it was $5 (again, off of a special menu).

But tonight's dinner changed everything. Sunday night, 6 PM, a booth for 2 kids and 2 adults. Tiffany was our server. And while most of the servers here have been very good, we've never had service nearly as good as we did tonight... at any restaurant. It's amazing how just one person can make such a difference. From the get-go we had everything we needed. Tiffany took our drink orders and before we had a chance to ask, we already had extra napkins (a necessity for a table with kids) waiting for us on the table. I didn't even see her set them down. Our chips and salsa arrived (with my special request for pico de gallo) and she brought side plates for each of us -- a dozen recent visits and we've never received plates with our appetizer. Drinks are refilled just before we empty them and plates are scooped up before they start crowding the table. Shockingly, we had constant service and attention as if we were her only table. Not once did we have to wait for something. She was on top of it all. Our service was in harmony with the food, which was fresh and well-prepared. Another pleasant surprise. It's a shame to be so blown away by such great service, but it really is rare, especially at a chain like Chili's. Tiffany could probably make twice as much at a 5-star restaurant, but I hope Chili's finds a way to keep her around. TIPS: * Call ahead on busy nights to put your name on the list. * There is open seating at the tables and booths in the bar area. * Parking is available in the mall parking lot, the underground garage and at meters on the street (free after 8 PM and all day on Sundays). * They occasionally have ""Kids Eat Free Days"" which you can find about by signing up for their emails (you may need their printable coupon). * The $20 Dinner for Two deal is worth checking out - go for the chicken fajitas! * Kids fountain drinks and lemonade get free refills (just like adult drinks), but milks are not refillable. * Check Facebook for other promotions and deals like free appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=140

Service was decent for a large party (there were about 14 of us), but the service lacked on drink refills. I DID appreciate that the service allowed us to break up into our own separate bills.  I did like the corn guacamole; chips are light and airy, perfect for dipping and not taking away from the guacamole. Also on the plus side, Chili's has Coke Zero, which I greatly prefer to Diet Coke. But two stars for you, Chili's, since my primary course was non edible.

Her demeanor was just all wrong. When she acknowledge us she looked at us and every other customers there like we were a burden and she was busy texting on her phone instead of providing customer service. Finally, she served us, the drinks, and food were good.  We then ordered 2 more drinks the same thing but they were made different. PRESIDENTE Margarita was a tequila Rita (no lime). It was too strong and tasted horrible. It made me sick. My husband asked for a MOD Tessa & asked if the drinks are made the same she was very helpful and was willing to remake the drinks. The server Jordan was  just watching and snarling at us while my husband spoke with the Mgr. I felt very uncomfortable & I just asked for the bill paid it and left.

Since when did Chili's convert to a Tex Mex restaurant?? The service was subpar and the food was MEH. Our waitress was nice but not very attentive. When we placed our orders she asked what dressing she wanted on her salad. My wife asked for Italian. She then told us they don't carry Italian dressing. Huh?? Then I placed my order and asked if I could get a side Caesar salad. She said they no longer have Caesar salad on the menu. WHAAA?! What kind of place doesn't have Caesar salad???  We ordered chips with guacamole to start. It took FOREVER to come out. When it finally did, she didn't bring the guacamole. She said it was coming. Yet, a table next to us who came in AFTER also ordered chips and guacamole and they got it no problem BEFORE us.  Now they have these little kiosks at their tables. We were looking through it. It has food info, news apps etc. It also has game apps to play while you wait. We didn't see any games we cared for so left it alone. I wanted ranch for my fries and I had to ask her twice for it. We got the bill and we saw we were charged for a game app on that kiosk! We didn't even realize we activated a game. It was all to easy to start a game up apparently. They removed it from our bill when we asked but they really should have a warning prompt like ""Are you sure you want to make this purchase?"" Or any kind of warning.

Super fresh and crispy served with tasty blue cheese dressing. For my main course I had the salmon and doubled up on broccoli. Salmon was well seasoned and well done...but completely what I expected from this type of restaurant.

Nooneh K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",221,163,82,3.0,7/15/2014,"When it's good, it's really fun; when the food is cold, soggy, undercooked or burnt, I wonder if it's worth the risk. The Boulevard has so many great restaurants, that there really is no excuse for bad food. If your doors are open, the kitchen should be good or better. My college memories outperform my recent two years of actual experiences at Chili's.  The staff is very nice, but the consistency of my food is a crap shoot. Perhaps I need to only order the new menu items in order to maximize my odds of consistency. Perhaps the kitchen staff gets too lax with the items they think they can cook.  Today I had overcooked soggy tilapia with wilting dehydrated steamed broccoli. AND I'm not a picky eater. REALLY! I wish I knew how to fix the problem. We all enjoy the staff and atmosphere, but I'm kicking myself for choosing to go there today after the two most recent experiences with the cooking quality. I ordered  'medium' steaks and received overcooked AND undercooked interpretations. I realize that thickness matters, but I'm assuming that appropriate temperature and time compensations are a part of the culinary school curriculum.  So I suppose it's worth a shot to suggest checking the temperature accuracy of the ovens and stoves as well as the timers' in the kitchen . Also the dining are remodeling  does not hold a candle to using the tools properly. Also a note that today was not a terribly busy evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=140

The last time I was here I was with a party of 5.  We got the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant.  Our server looked like she was 19, and she decided she was going to take our order without writing it down (very ballsy for a new server), 5 people's order without writing them down, including drinks.  What could have been an opportunity to impress us with her amazing memory skills, turned into her demise.  She screwed up half of our orders and even completely forgot to put my GF's order in.  My GF had to wait for her food while everyone else started eating, her food took almost another 20 minutes to come out.  Our beer glasses remained empty for most of the night because our server never really came around to check on us.  You would think she would have wanted us to order more, naturally isn't that going to increase her tip!? At the end of our meal, our party of 5 was royally annoyed.  We practically had to chase our waitress down for any kind of service, and from the looks of it, we were her only remaining table of the night.  She had no excuse!  It's almost like when she realized she messed up our food order, she just gave up for the rest of the night.  When the bill came it was just over $100, me and my friends don't usually do this but we felt like we had to make a statement.  We left her a $3 dollar tip and some advice on the back of the receipt, ""Next time, write it down!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=220

Paul M.,"Burbank, CA",78,14,,4.0,4/4/2014,"My family and I took an outing to Chili's last weekend and I must say it was great.  The place was very clean, the service was great, and the food was excellent!  I especially appreciated the selections of foods they had - we can be very picky eaters!   The chicken sandwich I had was amazing!  Loved the bread and seasoning of the chicken itself.  The others had burgers that looked mouthwatering and was told were great.  My chicken sandwich hit the spot, I was not stuffed but wasn't left hungry either. We didn't have to wait for a table and once we ordered, it didn't too long to get our food.  Our server was very polite and attentive to all our needs.  We all had a great experience and plan to return very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=180

Our server came to the table very shortly after we sat down. My granddaughter ordered off of the children's menu, a quesadilla with french fries. My wife and I decided to share that the fajitas. We ordered it with chicken and shrimp. There the  fajitas come with a carmelized onions and grilled vegetables mixed in. We ordered extra rice and beans for $1 more ( highly recommended if you like the rice and beans). In addition to the vegetables, there was a small tray with add ins including salsa and sour cream and cheese. In combination, they were absolutely delicious. And there was so much food that even with two of us had trouble finishing it. My only criticism would be the order we had for my granddaughter. The quesadilla was a little bit overdone on the edges making it hard for a kid to eat. Overall, an excellent meal with excellent service.

Sindy R.,"Fontana, CA",9,1,,2.0,6/22/2014,Me and my boyfriend LOVE chili's but we had a bad experience at this particular one. First of all we called ahead to get our names on the list since we didn't know the area or how full it was going to be. N when we got there they hadn't gotton our name down but they said they would move us up because they believed that we had called ahead. I ordered the bottomless express lunch that I normally get for the chicken enchilada soup and because we get chips n salsa while we wait. So I ordered that n the waiter brought the chips n salsa and about 5-10 mins later he brought out my salad and another 5-10 mins go by and he comes to tell me that they don't have any chicken enchilada soup. He should of informed me before I ordered! It was 3 in the afternoon that's a bit early to be running out of soup but whatever but then he starts offering the thee soups n I already know I don't like them so I ask I I can get something else meh says I can't so I choose the loaded potato soup cuz that's the only other one I sorta like n the guy brings me loaded potatoes... So I told him I wanted the soup not the potatoes so he brings the soup n it was tasteless n just bad. I didn't touch it! When he comes to leave the check I told him I didn't like the soup so he said ok that he would take care of it so in the end he ended up not charging us for my meal so that was good but then we noticed that he had charged us for the loaded potatoes he had messed up! But luckily he took that off too! So i ended up loosing my appetite with all the waiting n just one salad but the waited did handle the situation well in the end so that's why they got one star n the other on was because my boyfriends meal was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=240

Evan S.,"Northridge, CA",51,55,,2.0,5/21/2011,"When I was younger, I used to like this place.  I went back twice recently.  The first time I got a sandwich, and did not like it much.  I thought maybe it was just what I ordered, so when friends wanted to go there, I went along with the plan.  This time I ordered something I recalled liking when I used to go here, and again I was unimpressed.   My tastes have changed a lot over the years, and I'm much more health-conscious with my eating habits now than I used to be.  This menu is full of polluted food that will clog arteries and is prepared in just about the least health-conscious ways possible.  Everything is fried or drenched in oil or cheese or some calorie-rich sauces. Great if you like SAD (Standard American Diet) foods, and want to be a fat, bloated pig.  Not so great if you want to stay thin, eat healthy, and have a good heart. On the upside, the service was great both times, and the drinks are quite good.

The appetizer we almost always order is their Texas Cheese Fries (see my pic) and the baby back ribs, and surprisingly, the ribs have always been cooked to a tender perfection.  The ambience is nice and one aspect that I like about this particular Chili's is that they have plenty of random travel photos throughout the restaurant, along with other interesting items planted throughout the restaurant to make you amuse with fascination.

Dmitry K.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,363,37,3.0,2/2/2010,"The image and food of Chili's has been in declivity on the food and service scale, but it still ranks as a legitimate contender.  The portions are big and satisfying. The Santa Fe chicken wrap sandwich is an excellent choice for all the lean eaters out there. It is difficult to find something 'healthy' in their gargantuan menu of motley meat items and carb overload entres, but they do a good job on the offering and pointing out alternatives. Triple Dipper =Spinach and Artichoke dip, and the southwestern egg rolls tasted great. I definitely recommend these items in the triple dipper.  I do like their full bar option and the Mojito was one of the best Mojitos I have ever had. On weekends there is always a wait for dinner. Not long though. We came at around 8:00PM, and the guy told us it'll be a 20 minute wait. We waited for probably 7 minutes until they buzzed us in. Great strategy...Over-estimate the waiting time, so that when your called early, it will be a pleasant surprise. The bathroom was also an interesting pit stop in the Chilli's Grill & Bar adventure. I entered the bathroom. Paper Towels all over the floor. The trash bin was leaking and overloaded with paper towels. The faucet was on. No one was washing their hands or was in the bathroom.

As to the food, eh.  Its pretty average across the board.  There are a few really good items, the southwest eggrolls being on the yummy side.  If you have foursquare you can always get free chips and salsa (which are decent) for checking in.  The burgers are decent size and the onion straws are good.  The have a black bean patty if your a veggie eater.   The fajitas have gone a little down hill over the years and are now straight average and not a large portion.

The only had two to three tables to fit five to six people. After asked the person in the front a few times as to when a table would be ready, she stated as soon as some would got up. A group of six people got up from a table and that open table was given to a party who gave 35 minutes after us and they were seated because the had children. Horrible service. After another 10 minutes, we were finally seated.  Went to the restroom to wash my hands. Disgusting inside. It looked like no one had checked inside the bathroom all day. Washed my hands and got out if there.  Got back to the table and ordered chips and guacamole and  a mango salsa chicken. There were no forks or knives on the table and it took another 10 minutes to get those. By the looks of the picture for this item, I believed it would be a medium sized portion. This portion looked as though it was for a small child. I ordered it with fries and steamed broccoli which were also child sized portions. I was disappointed in the portion size. The chicken and mango salsa tasted good. Chicken was cooked well and the mango salsa tasted fresh. The fries had some overly poured salt and the broccoli was good.  Overall, I do not think I would order this item again because it was such a small portion. The service was good. The waitress would bring water before it even ran out and was nice.

Gabriel K.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",223,46,2,1.0,6/15/2013,"06/05/13 table # 21/1 8:07pm 10024  My family and I arrived to this location and were seated within 10 minutes.  I ordered everyone's meal and I ordered a plain burger with fries for myself. We also ordered the chips and salsa as an appetizer.  One would think making chips and a burger is pretty fast and the 2 easiest things to make. We received he chips about 2 minutes before the entrees arrived.  The chips was cold and was not fresh in any way.  When the food arrived, there was an issue with the burger which would have been a quick fix. The burger that was supposed to be plain, had everything on it plus more.  Great for a person who likes eating everything but I do not.  The waiters response to the error was that he was not sure what was going on in the kitchen and took it back.  5 minutes later, i was brought another burger that looked plain.  When I took my first bite, all I could taste was ketchup, pickles and tomatoes.  I realized that all the kitchen did was scrape off the condiments and was sent back out. Why not make a new burger.  What if I had allergies.  What if I get sick from something on the burger and that is why I like to have my burgers plain.  We called over the waiter again and advised him of the situation for the second time.  We also advised him that it is not sanitary and safe to do what the kitchen did.  Don't you think if I wanted the stuff off that way, I could have done that? Who are they trying to fool.  It was the kitchens mistake.  He once again said that the kitchen is slacking off and he doesn't know what is going on.  I asked to see a manager at this time.  The manager came by and he was only aware of the first issue.  I explained the situation and he was not really in shock or care.  He just said ok, hell look into in and offered to buy a dessert and walked away. I was in shock of the response I was given. The 3rd burger arrived. I was hesitant to touch it because of possible backlash.  It did look weird and tasted weird so after a few bites, I just ordered dessert and asked for the check. Once the check arrived, I saw something strange.  We were billed twice for the burger.  I called the waiter again.  I advised him of the new issue and he said that I was credit.  I asked him where?  He shows the the dessert credit.  I told him to look again and listen to what I am telling him.  We were charged twice for the plain burger.  He said, its a quick fix, walked away and brought me the correct invoice.  I do not recommend this place at all.  I think the kitchen is not professional and the customer service is horrible.  Taking shortcuts on making a burger because of an error the kitchen made shows no respect to customers or health.  I hope this location gets inspected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=200

I asked the waitress to bring me Strawberry Lemonade, which was thankfully much better. Then I ordered my meal, the country fried steak. On the menu, it comes with mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and two sides. So when I first received my dish, it only had the mashed potatoes, corn, and the sides were MISSING. I asked the waitress to correct this, and when she brought it back, it had the two sides (which looked really unappetizing) but the corn and mashed potatoes were now MISSING. W.T.F....Also, my steak knife was missing. I was so irratated, but tried to keep my cool. It was very hard though, considering how frustrated I was. I mean, that's so simple, why was it f*cked up?

I'm not trying to be a bourgeois snob, but that was some of the worst food that I've had in a while.  Sure, the prices are reasonable, but unless you're bringing a kid's birthday party there, you're missing something.  There are family-owned places where you can get a homemade meal for the same price, so don't tell me I'm a fucking elitist damnit.  That shit was just plain nasty.  I consider it a cultural experience... and it's a culture in which I want no part.  1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=260
Kleio V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/4/2015,I used to love ordering food to go from Chili's but the last 3 time the sides I have ordered to go along with my meal has been lacking. I enjoy the chips and salsa and I also normally order the quac as well. The frist time I had full to go order cups full of the salsa ad also the quac. But the last 3 times I have ordered food the sides I ordered to go along with my food has been half full cups of salsa and half ful l cups of quac. The bag of chips are also half full and mostly crushed. I am normally in a rush when I pick up my food because of time restrants so that I can get back to work so I am not able to check my food until I get back to work so I can eat while at my desk. By that time I have no time to go back and try to have them fix the issue. This makes me very upset becuse I also always leave a tip for the person who is just grabbing the bag of food that has already been set out for them. They could at least check it and make sure that it is correct before handing it off to the customer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=260

My wife had an caesar salad with added grilled shrimp ($6.49 more) and again, it was a non discript, plain, boring salad. Something must have changed at the home office at Chili's because one of the main reasons we have always returned to Chili's, was their consistency. With costs for food and the economy the way it is these days, I think returning to Chili's and giving them another chance is out of the question for us.

It's never busy when I go and I always get take out. It takes them like 15 min to acknowledge I'm even there. And I have to go to the bar and the daytime bartender is super slow and he once gave my change to someone else if it wasn't for the customer being honest and returning it. Id probably would have never received it. To top it all off my bill was like 9$ and I paid with a $100. I would understand if they were busy. But they aren't even busy, still I get horrible service. The food isn't even great. I order mash potatoes and they were so chunky and the Mac and cheese was undercooked. Every time I order, I get something different and it's always DISGUSTING !!!! I never have this problem at any other chilis. By far the worst chilis I been to. Food is gross service is horrible.

Brian S.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",73,11,,1.0,6/10/2013,"I'm usually not compelled to write a bad review about a place, but when I have the intention to bring my girlfriend to a place for a birthday dinner, as a last minute attempt to turn her bad day around, and the place makes it worst? I have to say something. It was about a week ago. I hurry up inside to let the host know it's my girlfriend's birthday and she notifies me that she will let the server know. Cool. I grab a booth immediately and the server, Randall, tells me that he knows about the birthday girl coming. We take a look at the menu and decide to order some sweet potato fries, oh you don't have anymore? Okay, well we were looking at the drinks, how about a margarita with that coronita on top. Oh you don't have anymore coronitas? Alright then, we'll just get the margaritas without the coronitas, but can you put them in those big martini glasses? Oh the bartender already poured them into mugs and you can't pour them into the glasses we asked for AND you ran out of salt? Okay server.  See, I work at a restaurant. I understand when you run out of things, it happens. But when a small request is made, after not having many of the things we asked for, and then you blame the bartender for not putting it in the right glasses because she ""already poured it?""  And on top of that they were the wrong flavors we asked for.  Food came. It was alright, nothing special. Spoke to the manager about what happened, he brings the right margarita WITH salt. Now I'm thinking, if the dessert comes with the birthday candle maybe it'll make up for everything that has happened. Oh, that's the check? Oh you forgot about the MAIN reason why we came here in the first place to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday?  I figured, I'd ask him if it was busy. Maybe he was busy tonight and that's why so many things went wrong. He replies ""No, not really."" I don't even know how to summarize our visit here.

I asked for the bill, they don't give checks anymore, the tab is on the touch screen and they want you to swipe your credit card on these devices to pay.  Well with all these security breeches recently. there was no way I was going to enter my credit card or ATM over their wireless network.  Preferring to pay cash I noticed an ""entertainment charge"" on the bill of 99 cents.  I told the server I simply clicked on the device but hadn't played any games, he was able to remove the charge.

I heard him tell a couple sitting close by, when they refused joining the rewards program, ""oh it's just free money"" as he threw up his hands, shook his head and walked away. This guy just made us not want to return to this location but I don't want him to lose his job, thus I'm Not saying his name, but he should tone it down a bit and not be so forceful. That's all. The restroom was also a mess which if I hadn't already ordered, I would have left. A good friend told me, if the restroom is nasty, don't eat at the establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=60
Allan G.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,17,11,3.0,2/25/2017,"Came here for dinner with friends after the movies. The wait was less than quoted which was good. Service was mixed, orders were taken promptly, but the food took a long time to come. Also, the fries that were supposed to come with the burgers were delayed- we didn't get them until our food was half done. Definitely a mixed experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=60
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3083,6380,5216,2.0,5/5/2015,"I have been putting this review off for months, Chili's is as boring to Yelp about as it is to go to. That being said the in laws love Chili's and i love my husband, so I go and sit and wait to be able to leave. I have tried so many of their menu items and have to say I like none. The salads lackluster, the fish horrible quality, the apps greasy and straight out of a package. Prices are high for the quality, service is fine, but that typical chain restaurant vibe coming through is just a turn off. Everything here is catered to the masses, I either just taste salt, grease or fat, no flavor, no seasoning, no love, not worth a penny of my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=60
Svatka P.,"Gilbert, AZ",129,49,312,1.0,3/28/2016,"I usually love chilis and their customer service, but this is the third time they managed to really screw up a simple online order.  I ordered the soup and salad combo, and specified for the salad no onions, croutons on the side, cheese on the side and extra cheese, with extra ranch. Meaning there should be a cup of croutons, two cups of ranch, and two cups of cheese for the salad. For the soup, I also asked for cheese on the side and extra cheese. So another two cups. I also order an extra soup, same way as above. I come to pick up my order, and look at it. Two soups stacked on top of a cup housing the croutons. Ok that's good. I look at the salad, IT IS COVERED IN ABOUT TWO POUNDS OF CHEESE. I saw that and asked the bartender that I ordered the cheese on the side for both soups and salad. He gave me a cup of cheese to take home. I get home and there's NO DRESSING FOR THE SALAD!! How do you manage to forget the ranch for a salad, and on top of that charge me extra for the extra one I wanted and not give it to me. I give up on this location. They've screwed up take out orders three times in a row now. Clearly they need to be retrained on how to READ AN ORDER. Management doesn't even care as I never even see one around. Sooooo disappointed. Take the extra drive and go to a different location. This one sucks. Period. You lost a customer who's been coming here for years. Thanks chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=60
Yung R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,1.0,11/1/2016,"This place is complete trash, my family and i drove from hollywood to come here. The experience was garbage the food took long and to top it off we had requested a happy bday song for our friend when i asked the server if  they do these type of things she said yes. 1 hour passed by and nothing we were already leaving and I confronted the host whom I previously asked and told her what had happened ? her response oh sorry we forgot. really? never again will I come here wasted my time and the food was bad. stay away !!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=60

Jennica R.,"West Hollywood, CA",660,118,2841,3.0,3/30/2015,"Since my boyfriend was craving Chicken Crispers one weekend, we found ourselves heading to Encino just to hit up Chili's since franchises aren't too common around our Hollywood area.  LOCATION & PARKING Located on Ventura Blvd. on the Valley's Miracle Mile Encino Commons in a plaza called Encino Town Center. Personal parking lot next to Chili's but parking is also available in the surrounding lots in the plaza.  AMBIANCE & SETTING Super casual spot great for a casual date night or group outings with family or friends. Plenty of booths and seating areas. Very clean, well lit, and well-maintained. Average noise level making conversation with others possible. Several TVs throughout the restaurant and at the bar. Ziosks are on every table to make ordering food/drinks and paying the bill more convenient and efficient.  CUSTOMER SERVICE Came in for a super late lunch in the afternoon and was seated immediately by the friendly hostess. We ordered the Dinner for 2, which included an appetizer and 2 main Entree dishes. Service from our waitress could have been better cuz she forgot our Appetizer, which didn't come until AFTER our main entrees. And she didn't bother refilling our waters and only asked when it was clear that we were finished with our meal and ready for the check. My boyfriend didn't wanna bother waiting for the waitress to bring us a check, so we paid using the Ziosk.  FOOD Honestly, we really only come here for the Crispy Chicken Crispers. The other food items are alright, but not that great. If you go with your significant other, spouse, or friend, I recommend the ""Dinner for 2"" Menu for around $20 cuz you get one Appetizer and choice of 2 Main Entrees. We were SO hungry, we also got a side salad that was surprisingly huge!  Side House Salad - Fresh lettuce, carrots, tomato, cucumber, red onion, cheddar cheese, and croutons with a side of dressing of your choice. Big portion, light and healthy, and delicious! - GET IT!  Appetizer: Panko Breaded Onion Rings - Onion rings battered with panko bread crumbs. Soft, juicy onions inside and cooked nice and crispy on the outside! - GET IT!  Crispy Chicken Crispers - 5-6 pieces of Crispy Chicken with a side of Ranch sauce and paired with your choice of 2 side items. My boyfriend went with Loaded Mashed Potatoes and a side of Steamed Asparagus with tomatoes. - TRY IT!  Honey Chipotle Crispy Chicken Crispers - Waitress claims it's spicy, but it really isn't! This is my Usual every time I visit Chili's. Basically it's Chicken Crispers covered in delicious Honey Chipotle sauce with a side of Ranch dressing paired with 2 side items, which are usually French Fries and Corn on the Cob unless you'd like to switch them out. So. Damn. Good. - GET IT NOW! Overall, the service could improve on bringing out food in an appropriate sequence and in a timely manner. But those Crispy Chicken Crispers are really the ONLY reason we return to Chili's every now and then. Otherwise, we probably wouldn't come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=60

Seemed upset I sat in this chair (more on that later). Gave me my beer in chipped glass.. has not talked to me since. She texted while In tried to get attention to Order Chips and Queso. Man walks in sits next to me, she greets him asks what he wants: ""water"" double shot of vodka and tonic for this guy. Obviously her bf or friend.. I ask her for chips and Queso when she comes over to chat more with him. Since.. this guy has received chips, guac and salsa and just now got his food.

We respect and appreciate what servers, bartenders, chefs, and the rest of the crew do. We can confidently say that we have NEVER had a bad experience at this Chilis. The service has always been incredible. The food is always fresh, the hosts are always kind and courteous, and the place is always clean. Props to the manager for hiring a good crew. We'll be back for some of that kick ass queso and chicken enchilada soup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=60
Rudy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,44,42,1.0,5/10/2017,"Been coming here for over 10 years but tonight sucked, more than usual. It's been a slow and steady decline at this Chili's. Completely understaffed. Food was literally inedible. Not to mention they ran out of asparagus in the steak, shrimp and asparagus plate. Shrimp was cold and undercooked - ugh! My medium rare steak was like cutting into leather and WAY undercooked. Waited almost 20 minutes for another glass of wine even using that hokey iPad ordering gizmo. For the first time ever I sent the food back and didn't want anything else. The last time we were here the food was so over salty and cold. We thought we'd give them another try. Nope. It's Wednesday. I wonder how bad it sucks here on the weekend. Regardless of the miserable experience our waiter was great and did the best he could. Moving on and never coming back here again. Sad, cuz this was the place I had my first date with my partner back in 2005.  *sigh*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=60
Elisa T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,41,20,5.0,9/29/2016,"Tried the Guacamole Black Bean Burger and it was delicious!!! Great flavor with just the right amount of heat from the jalapeño. The french fries were good too, although it was a smaller portion that I'd like and they were a bit too soft for my liking. But, overall, satisfying and flavorful food! I had this meal delivered to me as part of a special promotion and I am happy to now know that Chili's offers a satisfying vegetarian burger. I'm sure the staff was extremely busy today with all of the promotion orders....Thanks for the hustle!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encino?start=60
