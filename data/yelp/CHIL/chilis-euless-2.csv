Tim S.,"Plano, TX",98,498,382,1.0,8/18/2011,"Chili's is the McDonald's of American casual dining. You usually know exactly what you are going to get. Not always. This restaurant is one giant cluster ""F"" and exactly why I try to avoid chains. Someone gave me a gift card so I tried to use it. Here is my experience. I went there a few days ago and was told that there would be a 15-20 minute wait. I looked at the bar area and there was only one person sitting there and asked if I could sit in the bar, ""No"" was the answer, I turned and walked out after noticing a sign that said you could call in and get to the first of the seating line. So, yesterday, I called at 11 AM and told them I would be there at 12:40, fine, they said. I got there and this place was so crowded, I could barely find a parking space. I went up to the same guy that was there and told him I had a call in for 12:490, and he said, ""Yes, but there is a waiting list"". I told him I knew that, and was glad I had called in. He said I would have to wait. I told him to read the sign that was right beside him, "" Call in and blah, blah"" and get me the manager. Manager comes and seats me immediately. I told him about coming a fews days before and stupid guy at the door not letting me eat at the bar. Things are looking up! I tell waitress I have a check in deal for free chips and salsa and she says great and takes my order, brings me my drink and chips and salsa. I ordered chicken nachos, which were delicious! Finished up, got my bill and waitress had charged me for chips and salsa! I pointed this out to her and smart mouth waitress said, ""We usually charge you for the food you order"" and reminded her about my freebie deal and she was apologetic. So then it took like twenty minutes to get my bill fixed and manager took several other things off, thank you manager. I asked him, ""How hard to you think a person should have to fight to get to a delicious platter of nachos?"". This whole thing was so ridiculous! I will definitely NOT be back! BTW, just to make smart mouth waitress really mad, I tipped her 20% on the original amount, that ought to show her!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2?start=40
Ashley S.,"Bedford, TX",0,1,,4.0,12/23/2010,"Chili's is great! There isn't too many places where Mom can take 3 kids and get great service, great food, and get full in under $30.00 (including 25%  tip).  They also support our local school in fundraising, not to mention other local/national charities.  Chili's is in our top 3 places to eat for our family.  Way to go Chili's, Keep up the good work!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2?start=40
John M.,"Grapevine, TX",8,5,,5.0,10/6/2017,"We went in for early dinner. So there were not a ton of people. We did have our 6 month old. The host was very prompt and seated us quickly. Our server came out pretty quickly and gave us our dinner ensemble.  Dinner: qeuso app             Black cherry margarita             Black cherry lemonade             Ribs             Buffalo chicken salad Everything came pretty quickly, the drinks came first. The black cherry flavour is very nicely done. I went with the dry rub. Not a bad decision, but the sauced ones are slightly better. Overall the ribs were very well done, and not tough or over done. The salad was well put together, and the wife enjoyed her salad. All in all, a very nice outing and well balanced drinks were had with good food. Keep up the good work in Euless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2

Thuy N.,"Arlington, TX",58,151,899,3.0,10/10/2015,"The self ordering systems makes this an appealing restaurant if you going to dine in route. But paying money.. Even $0.99 to let kids play on tablet while waiting is silly. Ok off my soap box The bbq is the reason we go since the beloved chicken has changed for worse. What used to be a tender chicken lightly battered is now a large piec of chicken heavily battered and full of oil.. Totally out of balance.  I would go here if there were promotions lr deals like kids eat free. Otherwise, I would rather go to Cheddars if it was closer",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2

The food was good, had a few soggy chips that my parents made a comment about though. The only complaints I have was that on the kitchen end things took a bit longer than they should have given how empty the place was, it's a Monday night after a major shopping weekend so Possibly they might have been understaffed after 3 days of all hands on deck? Also I think Corporate got rid of mozzarella cheese sticks, for cheddar bites! Sad face!  Overall a much better chilli's than the one in grapevine but there is still room for improvement!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2
BJ E.,"Euless, TX",3,22,,2.0,4/13/2016,"The Euless location Chili's is only a few miles from us, but we have found the staff's maturity level to be extremely low during our visits.   They act like they are only there to interact with each other and the customers are a secondary concern.   The antics of some of the waiter's makes you feel like you are eating in a high school lunch room.   You expect disruptions from a crying baby, a ten year old running up and down the tables or ""the guy"" that talks too loudly on his cell, but not childish noise from the staff themselves.    Tonight one waiter did what I can only describe as a Pink Power Ranger run, jump and karate kick with sound effects at another waiter a few feet away from our table.   While the food is not bad, in the future we will restrict our dining there to take out only or just eat elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2

One more thing..I'm good with my masculinity, but it is always cold in the bar, im sure the ac is set for the staff, but the bar patrons (11) wearing sweatshirts, jackets...crazy.... picture to follow.

Billy H.,"Bedford, TX",0,42,,1.0,7/19/2016,"We have been going to Chili's restaurants for many years in various locations. This was by far the worst service ever. We were two adults and two kids. We arrived around 8:00 on a Tuesday to a far less than busy place. After being seated, it was a while before a server showed up. I ordered a beer and was asked if I wanted a bottle or draft, I chose draft. After another long wait, the beverages and the chips arrived except for the beer. I was told that they didn't have that beer on draft. I said a bottle would be OK. Another wait and the bottle of beer arrived. Then the really long wait began. We finished one plate of chips and some of the beverages. Still no food. We were told our order was next up, but I saw our server deliver food to another table next. Another platter of chips was half consumed before our meals finally arrived, except for the fries for one plate. They weren't ready. At this point I asked for a manager. After a few more minutes a different server brought the fries and said the long wait was too long and he would tell the kitchen to be faster. This guy never identified himself as a manager or offered any real apology. Next time our server came by, I asked if that guy was the manager. She said yes. I pointed out to her that he was spending a very long time talking to two attractive young women at another table. I got an eye roll and the assurance that she would let the area manager know. I hate to rag on servers for kitchen and/or management problems, but our server was also less than stellar. To wrap it up, we used the table kiosk to pay. There were two bills for our table. One for our food and beverages and a second one for the draft beer which they didn't have. So, it was almost a perfect screwup. Service, food /beverage delivery and billing. Most Chili's are fine, this one on this night was a disaster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2?start=20
Tim G.,"Arlington, TX",122,154,8,2.0,3/30/2015,"Not sure why they have the computers on the tables since you can't order on them.  We placed our orders and the waitress repeated everything with my wife requesting that her soup be brought first before her salad.  So when they brought my chili and salad and her soup, we were not concerned but the waitress did not return.  When we finally got her to the table, she was intent on placing the blame on my wife for not ordering!  Not once was there a manager around.  Other Chili's may be fine but I will go elsewhere in the future because of this rude waitress!  The salads were mediocre too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2?start=20
Carl P.,"Grapevine, TX",0,5,1,1.0,5/14/2016,"Tonight was the worst ever experience at Chili's so far as the food was concerned. The server was great, the lady manager (light blue shirt) was nice and really trying to help, but the head manager that came over at the end was just not willing to make our experience any better so we end up paying $62 for the meal for 2 plus a tip for what should have been a $20 meal for two plus $15 in drinks. We originally ordered the sirloin, in which two of the three steaks we couldn't chew through so we ended up spitting out. The third Sirloin was so tough we couldn't put the fork through and showed the manager that fact. We were offered Rib eye and then were charged full price for that because there sirloin was not edible. And somehow this is our fault. We tried to get the manager to comp something other than the three steaks he took away, which means we got zero benefit from those steaks and forced to pay higher for the ribeye, and are part of both steaks. We didn't bother to say anything until the end that our ribeye a we undercooked (raw looking in center, overdone pale on outside). I know this isn't a steak house but come on. No wonder this place has 2.5 stars. Previously I've stuck with the California Flat Bread, and have liked that. We got dessert,....yes dessert was indigestion from our lousy food at Chili's. I'd advise to stay away, far away from the steaks, and stick to chicken anything. Kinda hard to F chicken up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2?start=20

They don't know how to have great customer service yet. AND they can afford to get paid 2.15 + tips... or whatever the going rate for servers is. The food is decent. Burgers are ok, but seriously... just ok. Not spectacular. Don't mis-read this, because there are TONS of better burgers out there. I mean, if you're going to Chili's, just don't get a burger.

This one has been around a few years, and usually service is good, but it, like others, can be hit and miss, depends on your servers mental capacity and work ethics, I think. Okay, first thing is this, if Chili's didn't serve the salsa and chips that they have been for years, I doubt I'd be going in very often, if at all. While the other stuff on the menu is decent to pretty good mostly, it's usually filled with stuff I go somewhere else to get, that makes that item better. Not hatin', just sayin'. Yep, I go in, get the salsa and chips as my main concern, then fill in around it. Usually a sandwich of sorts, or maybe the app combo, or an occasional burger. I like the onion strings, but they're usually a little greasy, but then most onion strings are I guess. Basically, I LIKE THE SALSA AND CHIPS, and everyone else I know who goes to Chili's IS THE SAME WAY! Maybe they should find a way to capitalize on this more? I dunno.

A couple times we have walked in while it was slow and it took a while to be greeted and seated. The service was a little below average and slow. The food also has issues. A few months ago my husband ordered chicken. I think they were supposed to be like chicken wings. They came out cold so he send them back and they were warm but had hardy any sauce on them. This last time I got the chicken fajitas. Wow was there a ton of onions. I like onions but that was pretty much all they were. There was also a weird taste to everything. Maybe they were old. My husband got the pasta which he liked but the bread was covered in grease. He couldn't eat it. On top of that I overheard the person next to us send their food back because it tasted old as well.
