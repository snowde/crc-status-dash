Penelope A.,"Nashville, TN",0,117,3,1.0,10/12/2017,"i ordered chilis from a delivery service. The food was VERY low quality, like school cafeteria food. It was not good AT ALL. Do not eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evansville-2
Jentry R.,"American Fork, UT",1,3,,1.0,5/19/2017,"My husband and I are huge chilis fans. We go quite often, love the food and the atmosphere! Unfortunately our most recent visit to the chilis on Green River was awful. We came in about an hour before close, and we are usually pretty quick in restaurants, so we thought it would be no problem. The waitstaff thought differently. We were not greeted when we came in, and were directed to our table with very few words from the hostess. We sat down and started looking at the menu while being rushed by our waiter(who would check in with us, what felt like every 45 seconds). After ordering our drinks and food, and waiting FOREVER, our waiter sends over his manager to let us know that he had placed our order wrong. (We are usually very understanding people, but at this point we just wanted our food) we politely asked if they could start the order again, and we would patiently wait. The manager walks a few feet away and complains Loudly (loud enough that we heard everything very clearly) that we wanted the order to be made correctly. After our food was (finally) brought to us, the waitstaff continued to rush us(by bringing the check after we had only taken a bite or two of our meals). Our waiter and another waitress stood about 6 feet away from our table complaining about people coming in ""late"", they watched us eat until we felt SO uncomfortable, that we boxed up our food and took it home to eat. I have never felt so uncomfortable and awkward in my life! I will NEVER eat at this location again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evansville-2
Pam S.,"Henderson, KY",1,57,,2.0,2/28/2017,"I have to agree with Nikki C on this place.  We hadn't been here in years but decided to try it again based on perusing the online menu.  I was severely disappointed.  I had the Margherita Flatbread which looked so amazing.  It was not.  The garlic aioli was so overwhelming I could only eat a couple of pieces and that was after I attempted to scrape off the aioli.  My dinner mate had the chicken bacon ranch quesadillas which were ok I guess but not great and how can you make something not great that consists of cheese, bacon and ranch dressing?  We won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evansville-2
Nikki C.,"Vincennes, IN",41,28,18,1.0,11/2/2015,"Good god..... This place has four stars?! Let me just say, if it was possible to give no stars, I would. If you have any expectations when you go out to eat, avoid this place at all costs.  I hadn't been here in a really long time, when my SO had said they wanted to head over there after a long day of work for some dinner and beers. I should have said no. This place is perpetually dead. It was a Thursday night, which is typically a busy night for a business like this, and there was all of maybe,  ten people in there. RED FLAG. We sat in the bar, and there was a couple at the bar, and two more at their separate tables. Everyone but a small family that occupied this restaurant were located in the bar, and it was a whopping six patrons.  The bartender was out server, and my SO had asked if they could turn the football game on the TV in his line of sight- no problem! Great. Drinks were out, and we were off to a good start. Waitress was short with us, but no worries, I served for a long time, I know sometimes when business is slow, crankiness ensues.  Our appetizer was decent- fried pickles. Not bad.  At this point we reminded the server that we requested the TV be changed- and being that she cashed out all three tables she had, we didn't think it would be an issue, I mean, she did already say she had no problem with it. We were nice about it, and she instantly got frustrated. Started flipping through, yelling around the bar wondering what channel it was on, and how ""it was going to take so long because it was on a lower channel"" and finally exclaimed that she didn't have time for it, and that we could do it ourselves. Cool, no problem. A manager that has so appropriately sat down at a table next to us to eat, overheard her, and is a real gem and changes the channel in what was close to five seconds. Whew, what a hassle right? Who would have thought a transaction like changing a tv station would take serious time? I still am perplexed by her confusion with changing the TV until I see her go up to the manager's food, cut half the burger and squirrel it into the back with her. Okay, so she's hangry. That's fine, I guess. Sidenote: Am I the only one that thinks it is really unprofessional to be eating out in the dining room when you are on the clock? Something about cleanliness comes to mind when she's tearing her slab of the burger off.  I ordered the fajitas. After about fifteen minutes of hiding she comes out with tortillas, rice and beans. Foods ready, right?! Not quite. Those sat there by themselves for approximately ten-fifteen minutes. Rice. Beans. Tortillas.  When she returned with a not so sizzling fajita plate, I asked her what was up with bringing them out so early... ""Uh it's no problem, I'll get you fresh ones. It doesn't matter. Those tortillas aren't cold""  Okay, now I'm getting pissed. My SO has yet to receive any of his food, and I'm sitting here with the saddest looking plate of fajitas I've ever seen, accompanied by ice rice and beans, and some soggy tortillas.  I tell her to forget the remake of the cold items, and she says she will call a manager. My SO finally receives his meal another ten minutes later. This whole exchange is so awkward at this point where we just wanted to leave.  The chicken looked like that microwaveable chicken in the plastic bags that you use on salads. It had a plastic texture. yum! His food was apparently okay, but wait, here comes the manager!  She asks me about what's going on, and she couldn't give any less of a shit.  Server can tell I'm upset, and yells, ""Don't be mad at me, I don't make the food"" My blood might have been boiling at this point. What a great way to relax after a long day. I didn't eat more than a piece of the plastic chicken, and the server comes up and announces she's taken care of my rice and beans on the ticket. A whole dollar, ladies and gents. Bravo, customer service. I didn't eat anymore of the crap, and paid the bill.  In conclusion, stay the f away, people. This place absolutely sucks. There's way better options on Green River. Stay out of this hell hole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evansville-2
David F.,"Owensboro, KY",0,18,7,4.0,7/30/2015,"Much to my surprise, we had a really good experience here. I say that because usually this type of restaurant (like the Applebee's and Fridays type) produce mediocre food and a hefty price. So I guess we went in with that expectation. But the food was actually really good. Everything had a good flavor. Served in a timely fashion. Staff was friendly. We always ask to see the manager and brag on our waitress or waiter when we receive good service. We asked to see the manager, who arrived promptly. Brought himself to eye level and listened intensely to what we had to say. Really nice guy. The only thing that could be previewed as negative are these electronic kiosks at each table. They're so cool, I found myself mesmerized by it and not talking to my wife! So I just turned it around so I couldn't see it. You can order drinks from it, or pay your tab. Pretty ingenious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evansville-2
Katie C.,"Evansville, IN",20,14,,2.0,1/26/2013,"I went here one afternoon, a Saturday, with my parents and my aunt.  The wait at a slow time of day was 20 minutes. So we sat at the bar and had a beer till a table was ready. When we were finally seated it took 10 minutes for a waitress to come ask if anyone was taking care of us. While 2 tables were seated around us and orders taken. It took another 30 minutes after we placed our order to get food. 3 dry, incorrectly cooked steaks with steamed vegetables and a club sandwich took 30 minutes. Needless to say, we were highly disappointed. I will probably never go back there. Nor will I recommend it to anyone. Service was about as bad as Denny's. But at least heir breakfast is good and cheap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evansville-2
