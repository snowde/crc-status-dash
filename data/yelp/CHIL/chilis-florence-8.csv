Marcus M.,"Indianapolis, IN",23,138,561,4.0,7/17/2017,"This was a sweet and delicious take on chicken and waffles. The serving size was so big that I just ate the chicken and fries and took the waffles home for breakfast for the next day. Two meals for the price of one - I can deal with that. The chicken was the honey chipotle style, while the waffles had a sugar crystal baked inside to maximize the sweetness. No extra syrup needed - in my opinion. You don't want to send your blood sugar through the roof!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Ben M.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",0,16,13,1.0,10/8/2017,"The service here is terrible. We waited 15 minutes before going back to the hostess stand and asking her to find our server. It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks and it went downhill from there.  The food didn't event rise to the level of average. Some Velveeta with weird meet nuggets called queso was disgusting amd unappealing. What wasnt cold was soggy and unimpressive. The only good thing were their chicken 'crispers' that we ended up sharing because the rest of our food was so gross. After telling our waitress of our bad experience the said ""hopefully we do better next time"" and walked away. They don't even care if you come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Hannah H.,"Florence, KY",3,51,129,3.0,11/24/2017,"Unfortunately their food didn't size up to their quality of service. The service was outstanding! Alicia was prompt to fulfill any needs we had, and did so quickly and with kindness. The restaurant was clean and cutely designed on the inside with a mix of booths, tables, and high tops at the bar. Unfortunately the food wasn't as great. We started with a pick 3 appetizer and we were unpleasantly surprised when it arrived. Their presentation needs some serious help, the appetizer looked sad. And the taste matched how pathetic it looked.  The southwest egg rolls were mushy, the fries pickles soggy, and the chicken was just ok. For our main meals my husband's burger was overcooked and dried out, even though he asked for a pink center. I tasted it and it honestly taste like a fast food burger. My chipotle chicken and waffles was pretty yummy, and the portion was huge, but wasn't enough to save our experience here, and I can't say we'll be back. We hit a $50 check on 1 appetizer and 2 entrees, which for the quality we found to be over priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Monique S.,"Newport, KY",39,87,249,4.0,11/11/2017,"This was the 1st time I'd been to Chili's. My husband and I were actually pretty impressed. We had 2 waitresses while there, Sue and Megan. Both were super friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were satisfied. We got the dinner for 2. It was a pretty good deal. An appetizer and 2 meals for $22. For our appetizer, we got the 1/2 order of Texas cheese fries. They were really good and definitely enough for 2 people. But, it didn't come with enough jalapenos for our taste. We also ordered 2 side salads extra. They were pretty big. The ranch and blue cheese were both really tasty. For my entree, I chose the Cajun chicken pasta. It was quite large. The noodles were covered in a super creamy sauce with big pieces of chicken, served with garlic bread. It was awesome! My husband chose the bacon burger. It was cooked perfectly and was so flavorful and juicy. As his side, he ordered the Mexican street corn. It was unbelievably good. The flavors were on point. I'll definitely be visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Cami P.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,13,,1.0,11/15/2017,Yet again another restaurant cutting portion sizes down to a joke of a meal......will no go back that was a 12.00 lunch for about a few bucks worth of food.....yep.....no more here.....the sad thing is...... You guys are wanting tips given to your waiters and its hard to look them in the eyes when they sit the food in front of you.......you've succumb to the greedy game......hence you'll lose the customer......thank God Chic fil A is next door,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Alex C.,"Union, KY",17,15,,1.0,6/17/2017,"The service was terrible. The waitress checked on us 3 times. To take our order, bring our food, and bring our check. The food was over salted and ruined the taste for me. Most likely will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Michael C.,"Florence, KY",56,32,14,3.0,2/17/2016,"You know what you are getting into a Chilis. If my kid hadn't asked for it on her birthday, I think I would have found a way to avoid the place for several more months.  Still, we were seated quickly. Our waiter Youssef was attentive. The children enjoyed their kids meals and even tried some different entries. And the coke fountain system didn't disappoint.  I order chicken crispers, because if i want fajitas I go to the mexican place up the road. Chilis chicken crispers are awesome junk food when they are done right. But this night, maybe they didn't want to bother with the batter. My ""crispers"" were the most paltry chicken tenders you ever saw. Looked like they came straight from the kids meal my kids didn't order that night. The kids went with burgers. So should I have. Next time: order a burger (maybe a chicken sandwich) and be done with it. But sit in Youssef's section if he is working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Ivet V.,"Newport, KY",86,118,760,4.0,8/9/2015,"When I want comfort good I come here, the famous crispy tenders are the best with the signature fries but today I  got the buffalo chicken sandwhich with a side of fries which was very satisfying.  To end my meal I got the be new Oreo molten cake which was very delicious. I love the original chocolate molten cake but this cake had the best of both worlds, chocolate and vanilla , topped with a big scoop of ice cream and then sprinkled with Oreo cookie crumbs served nice and warm!  Almost had to ask for some milk !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Matthew B.,"Alexandria, KY",7,15,,1.0,11/26/2016,"Horrible service!  The place was nearly empty, took forever to get the appetizers and food.  You could tell that it had been sitting in the window under the heat lamps both times.  Will not be going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Kyle N.,"Burlington, KY",27,25,16,3.0,10/14/2016,"Typical chain restaurant atmosphere, good food. I really like their 2 for $20 menu. Share an appetizer and two entrées - can't beat that deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Emily M.,"Independence, KY",92,5,2,1.0,5/8/2016,"Ate there today for Mothers Day, and let's just say I had two bites of my food. I ordered a Medium rare steak with a side of mashed potatoes. My first steak that came out wasn't even red/pink in the middle. The whole steak was brown, but not cooked brown, it looked like it had been sitting out for a long period of time and then they cooked it, so at no point would it have been red/pink. After I took one bite I could tell something was wrong, it tasted really weird and so I had them cook another ""fresh"" steak. They bring it out and it looked the exact same. I took a picture of it and then she walked away and gotten her manager. The manager came back and said so I heard something is wrong with the Serivce? I was not trying to be rude, or make this an issue but the manager just came out acting super rude. She said ""I looked at the steak it looks fine, how do you want it cooked? Is it not being cooked right?"" I said I want it cooked medium rare which means pink/ red in the middle, when you look at that steak it is not pink or red the entire thing is brown, even where it isn't fully cooked. She then tried to argue and then act like okay well do you want something else on the menu? I said no I don't want anything, so she took it off the bill.  I will not be eating there, nor would I recommend anyone eat a steak from there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Sarah H.,"Covington, KY",147,223,122,3.0,11/11/2014,"Service was good, even when they were extremely busy.. I just wasn't impressed by the food. I ordered the sirloin and it was just a really low quality meat. If I come back, I'll probably stick to an appetizer as my meal. Aside from that, the noise level was through the roof. Every single table had at least one small child. I feel bad for the servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Jennifer N.,"Cincinnati, OH",66,124,7,5.0,10/15/2015,I love chili's they have the best burgers ( black bean that is) and I really really love their nachos!! They give you a really big pile of them ( which is a plus for me) and if you happen to not finish them all they even give you a bag to take them home which is another plus for me because honestly who likes wasting food?? Another cool feature?? They have tablets to play games and you can also pay your check!! The staff is so friendly so I'll definitely be going back!! Chili's it's amazing!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Geri L.,"Dry Ridge, KY",23,41,4,4.0,5/27/2015,"Our service was very good. I accidentally spilled tea on me & our waitress brought more napkins to help me clean up mess. While I thought the food was very goid, my husband was not impressed. He got steamed broccoli & asked for extra butter . The butter would not melt on the broccoli.  He was also not impresses by the mash potatos, but he doesn't like melted cheese either. I tasted his potatoes & thought they were very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8

Mikey M.,"Newport, KY",76,21,555,5.0,11/21/2012,"As my dad would say : ""Chili's is the best restaurant out there, that, and Mc Donalds"". I agree with the Chili's part, that's for sure. The food here is delicious, the service is fast, and the chips are amazingly good. My family and I try to get out here at least once a week, and it's not the closest restaurant either. I get the Cajun Chicken Pasta every time, and it is great, absolutely fantastic. I can testimony Chili's for anyone, families, clubs, get togethers, and parties even. I had my birthday here, and a delicious, (but scalding hot) chocolate cake is brought out topped with vanilla ice cream for free. All my other family members can recommend the potato soup, which I tried myself, and it was of course ; great. My only nit pick of this restaurant : I wish it was closer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8
Rick D.,"Walton, KY",8,1,,1.0,10/29/2015,"After a long 2 and a half hour flight, I decided to pick up chilis on the way home. I called in my order and the person on the phone repeated it back to me. I show up and they have no confirmation of my order. They don't offer to rush another order or anything, just keep saying there is nothing they can do. Worst customer service ever. Will never go back!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8

Tom T.,"Florence, KY",0,20,,2.0,3/28/2016,"I cringe every time my wife wants to go here, $40 for 2 chicken sandwiches, $3.00 for a pop, servers who can only ask you ""did you leave room for desert"", then disappear for 20 minutes till they bring the bill, skip it, typical overpriced, uninteresting food, convict kitchen staff to stoned to read what you did or didn't want on your order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8

Ann L.,"Florence, KY",404,316,758,4.0,2/28/2011,This was my first time ever at a Chili's.  It's cold out and soup sounded good.  I ordered the CHICKEN & GREEN CHILE SOUP.  There wasn't much to it but it was really delicious. Server did a good job.  Restrooms were very clean.  Parking was a bit tight on this one particular corner.  I like the look of the tables.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20
Kelly R.,"Independence, KY",24,51,,1.0,6/2/2011,"I seem to attract servers who need more training. That being said, we went this past weekend with another couple and surprisingly on a Saturday night, were seated right away.  The restaurant was pretty full, but there were a handful of tables open. It took our server about 10 minutes to come get our drink order, but in all honesty, it was fine because that gave us time to look over the menu and order all at once. Our orders were placed and my husband got the one and only refill of the night (prior to the food even arriving).  The rest of us went without a drink about halfway through our meal.  Our server was too busy swinging his hips and singing to Beyonce to really care about us (this is in fact what he was doing, not me being a jerk). After we flagged him down several times for refills (which never came) and additional tortilla shells for the fajitas (which were brought after we flagged down another server), we finally asked for our checks.  OOOH boy.  This is where I really lost it and decided NEVER to go back. Josh and I ordered off of the 2 for $20 menu.  Neither of us substituted (it is clearly stated you are charged for substitutions) so when our bill arrived and was closer to $35 than the $25 we had figured, I examined it.  Sure enough - the appetizer and two entrees that were on the 2 for $20 menu were starred, but not reduced to that price.  20 minutes later when we finally saw our server again, I pointed it out and we got a hand flip and he said ""oh yeah, I know - I'll ring it in when I get your payment.""  Nope - sorry buddy - I want a receipt with the correct total on it.  So he brought us a corrected receipt (and a heavy sigh) and then took our payment.  Never apologized - never asked if we wanted boxes (again, had to flag down another server).  Never checked on us throughout the meal. Needless to say, his tip was not my most generous and I will not be returning.  I did check with other friends who have been to Chili's and they all had the same issue with the 2 for $20 check.  Is this Chili's way of trying to overcharge?  I'll let you be the judge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20
Ayona D.,"Seattle, WA",5,19,15,3.0,11/24/2010,Newly opened and much anticipated.  As we arrived we were seated quickly much to our surprise. It was busy but not packed so we really couldnt understand why it took so long for our waitress to bring our drinks. However when the foor arrived it was piping hot and really good. I had the avacado burger and fries and the burger was fresh as was the avacado.  I will defnitely be going again to try the margaritas.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20
Donielle W.,"Covington, KY",82,151,12,2.0,12/7/2010,"When this restaurant opened I was really excited to try it, but ended up being disappointed. They give you very large portions, and they're reasonably priced.... but compared to real mexican restaurants the food is bland. There's a lot of it, but all of the mexican flavor is gone! My husband and I got the 2 for 20 meal deal. For our apetizer we got guacomole and salsa. The salsa was good, but the guacomole was pretty much tasteless. It didn't taste like guacomole at all, and it was way too chunky. I ordered the chicken fajita, it was okay... but the chicken tasted charred. My husband ordered the chicken bacon ranch quesadilla. I think that was pretty good, however the rice that it came with was tasteless as well. Overall, if you've never been to a mexican restaurant you might really like this place, if you have though, I wouldn't recommend it, it just seems below par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20
Michael B.,"Kenton, KY",8,94,29,4.0,12/4/2010,"This was my first time at Chili's. I went with a party of seven on a Friday night. With the location being so new, of course there was waiting list. They told us 45 minutes. Then it was 15 more minutes. Then it was 15 more minutes. My mother-in-law expressed her frustrations with the manager who was very very nice and he promptly sat us at a table along with complimentary appetizers, a generous portion of appetizers at that. The chips and salsa were incredible! The salsa is right up there on my faves list with Rio Grande Newport. The food came and I was a little disappointed with the portion on the half-rack of baby back ribs, but they were excellent! My sirloin steak was over-cooked. I ordered it medium and it was dry and brown throughout. I sent it back. While I was waiting on my new steak, I enjoyed the loaded mashed potatoes, which are probably the best loaded mashed potatoes I've ever had. When my new steak arrived, it was on a whole new plate with a all new fresh sides, including a second helping of the loaded mashed potatoes, yum. I was pleased even though the second steak barely had any pink in it. I didn't have the heart to send it back a second time.  We had some troubles, but the management and server handled everything 110% to my satisfaction and I will be back! The quality of the food made up for trouble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20

Cody P.,"Burlington, KY",0,21,,4.0,7/27/2012,"Went to Chili's for lunch today.  The hostess was very friendly and was able to seat us right away.  Our waitress was prompt, attentive and friendly as well.  The food is good for a chain restaurant.  They have several selections on the lunch combo menu starting at only $6 each.  I opted for the grilled chicken salad from the Lighter Side menu.  It was very good but a bit over priced IMO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20

Angela W.,"Erlanger, KY",1,8,5,3.0,11/24/2010,"I've never had Chili's before- so I was excited to see one opening up near me. It was only 2 days after they opened when my friend and I decided to see if we could get seated and spend our lunchtime there. We walked in and asked how long the wait was for 2 people, and surprisingly we were seated right away!! The atmosphere was fun- they were playing dance-ish music, which was kind of distracting since I just wanted to relax and enjoy lunch but kept finding myself dancing in my seat. Even though we were seated immediately, after about 10 minutes I started to wonder why our waitress hadn't even come to take our drink order. As soon as she came to the table we ordered our drinks and food, since we were on lunch from work and didn't have a ton of time to spare. I ordered a cup of chili with cheese and a cheeseburger with fries. The chili was tasty, however there wasn't much meat- it was mainly chili-soup. The burger was very fresh and cooked perfectly. My favorite thing from the whole meal was the seasoned fries. We got our checks and I was a little disappointed to find their soft drinks were $2.29 each. I decided if I was paying that much for a pop, I was going to get one to go. I had to ask the waitress two different times for my to-go drink, and when she brought it it was smaller than a kid's drink. Overall the food was awesome, but I was left with a bad taste in my mouth about the service and the over-priced fountain drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20
