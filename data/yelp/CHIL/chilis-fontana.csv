Katrina B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,9,2,2.0,8/31/2017,I've been getting the fajitas for years but for the past year or so the quality of the food and the service have been going down. The chicken has no flavor. None! I swear the fajita pita from jack in the box tastes better. These fajitas used to be my favorite and I have continued to give then chance after chance but I'm done. I will not be going back for tasteless food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=20

Ahmad J.,"San Francisco, CA",1276,675,1835,3.0,7/4/2015,"We randomly stopped at this Chili's location for lunch when driving through the 15. At the peak lunch hour it was completely packed and we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. We got a bunch of stuff from the menu starting with the Triple Dipper ($11.99) with two orders of the roll and one order of chicken wings, chicken and steak fajita ($13.99), chicken and salmon custom combo ($17.99), soup ($3.09), mango chicken ($10.59), Quesadilla salad with avocado ($11.99) and finally chocolate molten cake ($7.19). Taste-wise the rolls in the triple dipper were good whereas the wings seemed stale and tasteless. The chicken and steak fajita was delivered to the table sizzling, but it lacked any pazzazz. At least it was properly seasoned and edible. Surprisingly the best thing served to us was the salmon in the combination entree. It was cooked just right ensuring a moist and juicy bite but the chicken in the combo was dry from being overcooked. The chocolate molten cake was Blahh.  Service was a bit slow but it always feels that way when you are hungry. Pricewise also it was not too bad for a sit down meal. What would sum up this experience would be boring. Everything was passable. Nothing stood out nor was it bad enough to be sent back. I haven't been to many Chili's locations and after this visit I'm pretty sure that I've not missed much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=20

Dale H.,"Rialto, CA",72,5,,5.0,8/7/2017,We love coming here all the time. We ordered takeout from there tonight. My salad and onion rings had something in them that made them too spicy to eat. I called and spoke to the manager Brian and he took complete care of the problem. He went above and beyond. I always order the same thing a-because I like it and b-because it isn't spicy. He gave me a couple suggestions as to what may have happened. So glad we will be able to eat here still!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=20
Ricardo S.,"Fontana, CA",17,7,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Been here a few times, the last being on 10/7/17.  Won't be returning.  1st problem was the chips, hard as a rock since they weren't fried correctly.  2nd was my wife's fajita plate, the rice was also hard as a rock and cold. Last and final straw was the ""Sunrise Burger"", has a fried egg on top.  The egg was raw!  Unfortunately I had already ate the entire burger before I saw some of the egg that fell out of the burger and noticed the raw egg white.  I decided to tell the waitress since she asked how the meal was, with no complaint just an fyi for the restaurant.  What happened next is what changed my attitude.  The waitress has the nerve to talk to me like I'm a fool and says ""it's a fried egg and has to be done lightly so it comes out raw for the egg yolk.""  I've fried many eggs in my life and know that the egg white should never be raw and can still have a good yolk.  She then proceeded to snatch my plate from in front of me and storm off saying ""I don't know what you want, you ate the entire thing."".  Again, it was not a complaint, I was well aware that I ate the entire burger but again I didn't notice how raw it was until I saw the piece of egg on the empty plate.  The waitress never returned to our table.  I had to finally ask to speak with the manager just so I could pay the check.  Shitty cook if you ask me so I don't know why the waitress was so rude.  Thanks for the pleasant lunch Bree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=20
Jacqueline B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",141,2,,1.0,6/24/2017,"Omg!! How many bad experiences can someone have at the same place!! Well, being the only sit down restaurant in the area, decided to give it another chance!!strike out again!! We waited 50 minutes for our food, our pasta came out cold. We complained, the manager Tom put it in the microwave and brought it out as though they remade it!!ugh, does he think we are stupid and wouldn't notice?! Kids chicken dippers were hard and dry like jerky!! My original chicken crispers came out as crispy!! They brought it back and it took another 20 minutes!! The last time we were here a very similar experience but the manager at that time seemed like he was drunk as well!! He was red, slurring his speech, and reeked of alcohol!!

There were two servers and one host (short Hispanic women). Point is we waited for 15 minutes and no server came to ask us for drinks. We decided to just leave. We were sat at a secluded section and were likely forgotten or unknown to the servers. Honestly, if there is a shortage of servers the host should know better than to sit two people down.

Both where smothered in salt. I asked for less salted chips and they came out the same. I tried asking for unsalted chips and what I got was a basket of chips so shiny from oil, they made MrClean's forehead look dull. Yuck.  For the main course I ordered the sirloin steak. The mashed potatoes on the side where cold and the steak was so dull and tasteless, I had airplane food that tasted better.

Food came out slowly, I had to constantly ask for additions which I had originally requested, Unprofessional, rude, lack of any type of personality, Also Jayde after her very long ""potty"" break forgot to bring me the final item of my order, which I just left because I had no time to eat it. Jayde needs to dramatically step up her customer service skills, but I don't have much hope for her because he manager is an imbecile as well, He did nothing the remedy the situation, not even a simple sorry about the service.

Angelena J.,"Fontana, CA",45,45,75,4.0,1/16/2017,"Came in on Martin Luther King's holiday. Waited for about 20 minutes. Okay no problem there. The problem came when we were seated. We waited an additional 10 minutes and had been passed up a few times. A table of four were seated after us, and a server came to them immediately. I'm not one to call for a manager, but I had to in this case. The manager, Namsah (hope I spelled her name correctly ) addressed the issue with great service, and an even greater apology. She gave us tableside homemade guacamole on the house, and she even prepared it!!  She had Melissa, our server, come and take care of us afterwards. She was very attentive, kind, and also apologetic.

Poppy C.,"Phelan, CA",9,117,13,4.0,12/2/2017,The food was really good and our waitress was very attentive and nice.

Melissa C.,"Lake Arrowhead, CA",26,67,7,1.0,12/10/2017,"I think Chili's has finally run it's course for us.  We received gift cards from the corporate office after a horrible experience at the location in Redlands, and decided to give the Fontana location a shot tonight. We checked in online and only had to wait about 10 minutes once we arrived.  We were seated at the crappiest table in the entire restaurant. Right next to the kitchen and the bathrooms. Literally my view was of a wall. When the host sat us, there wasn't even enough chairs for my entire family. So he had to go round them up. You'd think that this would be done prior to us being seated. We ordered the chips and guacamole to start. Most of the chips were soggy and oily. Not even remotely crispy. We were hungry, so we ate them anyway. My husband and I split the fajita trio which was mostly vegetables for $17.99. The steak was poor quality and very fatty. The chicken had zero flavor and there were only 5 tiny shrimp. Beans were cold and some of the shredded cheese had mold. My son ordered the club sandwich that was literally falling apart when brought to the table. The top of the sandwich bread had slid off and nobody bothered to think ""Hey, this looks like somebody's leftovers, we should remake it properly."" Nope. Just served it to us anyway. The lettuce was wilted and fries were cold.  Service was okay. Nothing spectacular, but the food and ambience were so shitty it really wouldn't have mattered. $67 for food that was one step above cafeteria slop. I would have had a better meal at In-N-Out for $15. I guess I value my money more than most, but I am really tired of restaurants serving shit food for nearly $100. Completely ridiculous. Sorry Chili's. You used to be a regular place for us, but you're no longer a good value for my family. Completely disgusting food topped off with cooks and servers that just don't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana

I had a little under hour to spare so I figured even with a longer wait I wouldn't have much of an issue. Had my drink and food ordered within the first 5-10 minutes of arriving and then....... Nothing. About 30 minutes passed without any indication of the food running late, the restaurant was sitting people as they came in when I first arrived so it didn't appear there would've been any significant reason for the delay.

Joana F.,"Fontana, CA",336,176,322,3.0,3/30/2017,"Seriously, JUST OK! Sadly, we've visited this spot several times, and it is nearly always a complete HIT or an absolute MISS! For a while there, I dreaded coming here because of a clueless hostess who had the entire restaurant in a state of utter confusion. Someway or another, we'd always end up ""forgotten"" when this hostess was the one seating us. Fortunately, she is no longer working here, but the service is, sadly, not as consistent as it should be.  The food has never been an issue (hence the OKness). I really enjoy their chips and guacamole, and they have several entrees that I am a fan of. I like the tex-mex pairing menu, as well as the fajitas. Can't go wrong with those. They also used to have this amazingly delicious watermelon lemonade, but I'm not sure where that went.  The place itself can be really dirty at times. Tables not clean for a while, etc. You never really know what you're going to get on any given day.  My best advice, cross your fingers before you walk in and hope it's a good visit!

When her plate got there the chicken was a little cold, but it had a good taste. I ordered the 6 oz sirloin medium well with asparagus. It was sizzling hot when it arrived and it tasted delicious. The deal comes with two presidential margaritas, but I upgraded both to the platinum for $4 more. I drank both of them and got a light buzz.

Upon entry the hostess said she couldn't seat me unless I provided my phone number. I must add she wasn't nice about it either. We were finally seated and it took a while for the waitress to bring our drinks but that's understandable since its Veterans Day. The Veterans Day menu offered hamburger with fries and chicken crisps with fries and two other options. I figured I would be safe with the burger. When the burger came it was so salty I couldn't eat it. I was going to try to eat it but my son saw that I was struggling so he called the manager over. The manager told me that the burgers are made extra salty. He asked if I wanted another Burger without salt, I responded asking if I could have light seasoning and he said no however he did offer to make one without salt and allow me to Salt it myself. Because of the time it took to get her food which was over an hour I opted to try to continue with my burger. After two more bites I couldn't finish it so I just ate my fries.

Danmo H.,"Montclair, CA",232,590,1953,3.0,2/7/2013,"Had lunch with my girly friend yesterday.  This location is in her hood, so it's newer than the one in my hood (where I was on Sunday).  Apparently, this chain has had a makeover, and a menu change, and taken on a team approach.  The makeover is tasteful even though I keep wanting to wipe off the chili logo/shadow that's on every table.  Menu has some good deals/prices, especially for lunch and some new healthy option type choices.  But not so sure i like the team approach because I get confused about which team member i spoke to and can't help the puzzled look on my face when there are check ins on our table 2 minutes apart (my thought, didn't we just tell you we are okay, or didn't we just ask for more water . . .)  Overall, it's decent, and glad they are stepping up the service, but they probably need to work on some kind of organized system for the team check in/service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=100

Scum and fingerprints on kiosks and Bartenders POS and the cash drawer (thick scum on cash drawer) YUK. Bar top has crumbs and is sticky, chrome display for beer taps has filthy streaks as if wiped down with a dirty wet towel. Music is good screens are abundant. These managers are either deaf, dumb, or blind. This Chili's could be a gold mine (further than it already is) but the managers have no clue about managing a restaurant. I'll give them some advice: Sales, customer service, and CLEANLINESS!!!!!! Sales are good, customer service is good, CLEANLINESS IS A 2 out of 10. Who wants to eat at a filthy place when it only adds about $12/hr including labor burden...MANAGEMENT: your customers deserve better, pull your head out and get with a cleaning program!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=80

Saint E.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",41,49,9,1.0,10/13/2014,"The only reason I am giving this review one star is because the food was decent. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything good about the service at this particular restaurant. The server (Ernie) was either having a very bad night, or he was brand new at his job.  His service was extremely poor and very disappointing. He was drenched with sweat when he first introduced himself to us. After we got our food, it took him FOREVER to come back to our table to check on us before we were able to ask him for a side of ranch dressing. My wife ordered a second drink and the drink took so long that she did not get it until after she finished her meal.  When Ernie brought us the check, he placed it facedown on a small puddle of water, rendering the check soggy and hardly legible. To top it off, he forgot to return my credit card to me, which I did not realize until I left the restaurant. When I return to the restaurant to retrieve my credit card, Ernie had a bit of an attitude with me, even though it was his fault and not mine. Furthermore, Ernie said his manager (whom the hostess identified as ""Mike"") had the credit card, as Ernie walked to the kitchen to summon the manager to return my card. Moments later, Ernie came back with my card and handed it to me without saying a word of apology. I stood there expecting the manager to come and talk to me but he never showed up. I decided that it was a lost cause and left the establishment. If you're going to dine at a Chili's, go to a different one and not this one on Summit. Better yet, go to Applebee's on Sierra Lakes Parkway where the service is 10 times better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=80

Mary P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,18,4,1.0,6/21/2014,"Service: slow as hell. For a party of two, 25 mins for appetizer to come out and 50 mins for food? GTFO. Also, our waitress had a stick up her butt; do your job and stop talking to your friends about your weekend.  Food: sub par...should have gone to Dennys.  Worst restaurant ever. Seriously, don't even waste your time here. I wish there was an option to give this place 0 stars. For starters, the waitress had a bad attitude from the moment she took our drink order...two iced waters. Then after she dropped off our appetizer, we didn't see her again for 45 mins. No popping in to check on us, nothing.  The water was the worst part. Nasty water. I get that it's tap water but it tasted like something died in it. It was revolting. When I mentioned this to our waitress, she just gave me a dirty look and asked if I wanted to order something else. So I got a soda....same thing. The water used to make the soda was the same nasty tasting crap. I didn't drink it after one sip.  The appetizer, spinach and artichoke dip, was okay but the chips tasted like someone dipped the bucket of chips in a salt bath. It made us thirsty but we couldn't drink the water! The food finally arrived almost 50 mins later....I had enough.  I spoke with the manager, Mike, about the issues. He acknowledged that they were having an issue with their water ALL DAY. Wtf. If you knew this, why expose your customers to it without compensating or offering bottled water?! For all I know, I could have been exposed to some nasty mold or God forbid E. coli in the water!  Seriously, do businesses not give a shit anymore?  Worst experience ever. The manager comped our dinner, but the damage was done. This place didn't squeeze a penny out of us, and for good reason.  Get your shit together, people.

I get the tablets on the tables making it a bit easier to order extras and pay your bill, but it seems to take away from customer service.

We asked our server if we could take it off the table so our little ones wouldn't break it, but we were told that we pay and order extras from there. Our server never came back to ask us for dessert or give us our check. We had to figure it out ourselves after waiting a while.

Kintaro O.,"Sacramento, CA",37,22,19,2.0,7/18/2011,"Alright, I concur with the majority of the other reviewers here, but I rarely give a One Star rating. This establishment should, perhaps, be rated with the lowest possible marks, but I'll give the waitress credit for the additional Star. I will say their Ribeye Steak is better than what you could normally find in the UK. But, that's really not saying much. The Brits do two things marginally well: Fish and Chips. Steaks in the UK are overcooked, cow biscuits. I was a bit surprised at how leathery and gristly their Ribeye was here. I was almost nostalgic and homesick. I thought I'd never find a steak quite as bad as the ones I get back home. Though I ordered it medium rare, and because it was so thin, it was essentially well-done. Hideous. It was the colour of dried dung with grill marks scored into it. And they didn't have any Bombay Sapphire gin for a proper martini.  Again, I remind the good reader that I am well aware of where I was. This was Chili's. I knew it wasn't Morton's or Ruth's Chris or Flemings. My expectations were already low.

Brian B.,"La Verne, CA",1,16,,2.0,3/16/2013,"This Chili's is disappointing compared to others Chili's I've been to in different areas of the country. The servers are sub-par as well as the food. The only reason it has a crowd is because it is the only restaurant of that type in that immediate area so the choices are limited. Last time we were there my wife order a steak - medium and it came out bloody. The manager came out and was awkwardly nonchalant about it. He said several times that the steak was very rare.  They took it off the bill and gave us one to go. When we got home and opened the box it was a different steak but just as bloody. Raw / Cold food, poor service, bad cooks. We will not go here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=140
Scott R.,"Fontana, CA",0,9,,1.0,5/5/2013,"We waited 50 minutes for nasty cold food. The food was missing items ""avocado"" soup never came and everything was gross. The whole family ended up with a food born illness that gave us runs. Keep away! It's disgusting, I'm still sick! The manager apologized and offered to give us a free desert? What a joke! The manager also agreed that they have bad cooks that make allot of mistakes... I was confused?

Angie B.,"Fontana, CA",0,17,5,1.0,3/1/2013,"I would not recommend this location. The service was average, but I didn't like the fact that we had like three different servers. I noticed my buffalo wings were a bit cold but didn't think too much of it until I took a bite. My wings were completely raw on the inside! Talk about salmonella! We brought it to our waitresses attention, and they brought out a fresh batch of wings, which took far too long I might add. The manager visited our table to apologize, but he was very socially awkward, insincere and downright creepy!

I bumped into my friend at the gym, so after our workout we decided to eat dinner and catch up. I ordered the healthy chicken plate with black beans and brown rice. I didn't realized that I was that hungry to the point I finished my entire dish. There was no leftovers this time and it wasn't a small meal either. I really enjoy the my chicken, it wasn't dry and it had lots of flavor to my surprise. So I enjoy eating here, yay another place I can rely on to eat in Fontana, however on that note, the wait was super duper long to get any service..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=140

Angel M.,"Long Beach, CA",17,41,12,4.0,4/28/2014,"My experience started out ALL BAD! I ordered a side salad and large nachos with no meat for my son and I to share. I was already in a bit of a bad mood because my drink was so packed with ice I could barely get my straw in (grapefruit juice). I hate that! Anyhow, come to find out my supposed to be meatless nachos had meat in them. I specifically told the girl like 5 times no meat. There's nothing I could have done to make it clearer. I gotta be honest, I was PISSED! She might as well have just spat in my food right there at the table. I wanted to just leave, but being 35 weeks pregnant and starving that wasn't really an option. The manager made it right though. Even though I feel bad about getting free food. That's the only train I hate complaining, I don't want them to think I'm just trying to get a free meal/discount. Feel me? The manager (Kyle) made me feel a lot better though, so I'm happy now. We'll be back to give em another try in the future.

Had lunch here the other day with my mom and son and the food was terrible. I ordered a cup of the chicken and green chili soup which came out lukewarm (plus had to be returned once because they forgot to add the chicken, wtf?), the rice tasted like it was from the night before all old and stale, and the soup was so salty I couldn't finish it. My moms corn soup actually had a good taste but also came out lukewarm. The Cobb salad was OK, not much flavor to it, could have made a better salad at home for cheaper.

Needless to say, I ordered the ribs; I should have really ordered the full rack of one of the ribs and not 2 halves because I felt gipped.  The 2 halves I ordered were the Chili's original and the honey-chipotle ribs.  I expected the original Chili to be good, but the honey-chipotle was waaaaaay better.  However, my gripe was that the half-racks are tiny!  I finished them with room to spare.  What the heck?!  I'm still hungry.  The only thing I could do was finish off my beer and go home sad.  Oh yeah, the service was super slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fontana?start=140

I ordered the Tilapia with rice and it was nasty, the rice was hard and burnt and the fish was gross!!! My kids got the baby back ribs and they didn't liked them either, too salty and over cooked!!! Even my little one's Mac n Cheese was dry and tasteless!!! My husband had the sirloin steak and it was nothing special. He asked for some steak sauce and the server never came back for it so we had to ask the greeter at the door to bring us the steak sauce!!! We didn't even want to eat our food anymore, we just wanted to leave the restaurant so badly that we just asked for to-go boxes!!! Even getting our check and paying for it took longer that it should!!! My kids and I just left an waited in the car for my husband to pay the bill!!!

We came here about 8pm on Sunday night and it was packed. They said about 20min wait. So we are waiting for atleast 20 mins and we see the tables open up just right of the door around the wall. We had 6 of us. The tables opened up for us to be seated and they give the table to a smaller group that came in 5mins after us. My mom flips out and they say there sorry over and over and that they didnt realize that those 2 tables where right next to each other and that you only had to push them together. So we leave. So a few days later we are looking for a quick bite and my son calls my mom and says how about Chilis, joking around. She says fine if you want to go. horrible again. We got sat right away but they screwed up the order and took forever on the refills. My ribs where dry and nasty. It is just a horrible expereince over and over.
