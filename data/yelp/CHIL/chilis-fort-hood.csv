Corey B.,"Temple, TX",46,7,,1.0,6/16/2016,"Probably one of the saddest decline in management and overall quality of service that I have ever seen in Temple. They fired almost everyone at this store and it is ran by all new people which you would think was a positive thing. They even updated the the exterior to try and attract new business but you can't cover up snotty attitudes, poor food, and an unwillingness to help a customer. Called in to place an order and they wanted to give zero effort in trying to accommodate to my requests . I get it some things can't be done but don't have a snotty nose little brat ask me if I want her manager to tell me the same thing because in her tenure she hasn't seen it done and refuses to figure out a solution. Never once was there a sorry I can't do that or any type of sentimental acknowledgment to my request. When you spend over forty/fifty at a local establishment you kind of expect to get a little treatment. If you want your food slapped on a plate by all means step up and be the NEXT guy. I prefer to look for restaurants where the fifty I spend was worth the 2-3 hrs I had to work and be away from my family. I'm easy to please and logical btw so this wasn't a dramatic to ploy to get something free or be unreasonable. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND PICK SOMEHWERE ELSE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20
Matthew K.,"Fort Hood, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/21/2015,"Can't i give less than one star?  30 minutes to fill a water order. Apparently the yelp app thinks this review is too concise. So, in order to please our yelp overlords, let's add this: starving toddler, working 30 minutes for a glass of water. After the water shows up, the waitress is gone again without taking our order. By now, lunch break is almost over, time to go, nobody gets to eat. Thanks for nothing, Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20
Lena H.,"Killeen, TX",3,63,139,2.0,6/19/2016,"Ordered a steak to go cooked medium, when I got home to eat it the meat was completely raw on the inside! I'm so upset.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20
Ted V.,"Wareham, MA",44,18,,1.0,8/28/2016,"Here for a week of TDY, staying on base. I have been to chilis quite a bit at home so I figured, this place is on base and close by.... Perfect. After a long day in planes, I just wanted a good steak and a cold beer, one would think that in Texas, that wouldn't be too much to ask. This place is horrible. Sunday evening at 1830 and the bartender decided to clean the bar, moving all the bottles to the bar top, literally right in front of me. The TV had Cartoon Network on, perfect for a bar? The bartender said ""ya I don't know why it's on"". So change it maybe? I got chips and salsa, or I should say, I got a bowl of salt with chips in it. Couldn't even eat them. I ordered the ribeye which comes with mashed potatoes in a skillet and broccoli. Perfect! The meal took probably 45 to come out, I was one of like 5 tables in the place so not sure why it took so long. The bartender came out with the steak alone on a plate and the skillet of potatoes. She said "" the broccoli isn't done yet and this was sitting there, I'll bring out the rest later"". Um... Ok Roger that. The potatoes were like nothing I have ever had before, I almost bagged them to bring home to patch a small hole I have in my Sheetrock. I wasn't sure if it was instant potatoes gone wrong or just some bi-product of the instant potato processing factory, mixed with cheese or paste or like glue or something. The steak was pork, I think. Or beef, I have no idea. It was white, but I'm not sure what it was because the layer of ""seasoning"" they cake it in. I was able to put down about 1/3 of it, the rest was just a fatty mess of white salty meat-ish stuff. The broccoli never came either. I just payed and left, defeated. Never again. Chilis needs to really do some work to this location. It's just bad bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20
Kayla C.,"Fort Hood, TX",0,7,1,1.0,3/27/2015,"This was the first resturant my family and I visited once we arrived to Fort Hood base. When we first arrived we got sat immediately! Our waitress was very nice and brought out drinks and appetizers very quickly! Not to mention the place wasn't even half full with people. But after seeing 3 tables get seated and receive appetizers my husband and I started to wonder where's our main courses (chicken salad,burger, chicken strips, fries)? We had to ask the waitress, which she apologized for the wait but said it would be right out. Another few tables receive their main courses that arrived after my family and I. I then asked to speak with the manager. needless to say I think of myself as being a pretty patient person as I have worked in an restaurant establishment for 6 years myself so I understand things happen. The manager came over although she was nice, she wasnt very apologectic. She admitted that the cook messed up our ticket and the kitchen was backed up. I expressed my displeasure and how I felt as though for us waiting 2 hours we shouldn't have to pay for anything. She said she understood, she had our dinner boxed up to go which the salad was so welted...it looked disgusting. ...but before we left our waitress brought us over a bill with our drinks and appetizers. Sadly we paid it with no fight and left a waitress a nice tip. This restaurant is sad!!! I would have considered giving them a second chance but having to pay anything after waiting 2 hours for a freaking burger and salad in an empty restaurant is ridiculous! Watching other people arrive after you and leave well before you with full stomachs! I don't normally post bad experiences because everyone and every place has an off day ...but this restaurant is not customer satisfaction orientated!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20
Slim D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",24,64,109,4.0,4/17/2015,"I See there are a lot of mixed feelings about this location but I still took a chance. Today is Friday 17th 2015, I got off for lunch early and went straight over before the crowd rush. 1030 is when they opened up it was only about 6 people inside. The greeter was very nice and ready for anyone to walk in. I sat down at the bar I ordered immediately. Food took maybe 10 minutes I got the Cajun chicken pasta. It was a little salty but still good. They took a while to cash me out but I was in no rush. So although there is a lot of negative criticism for this place I had a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20
Dustin D.,"Temple, TX",43,1,,1.0,7/11/2016,Food was not good at all. Quest felt like it was squeezed out of a bag and warmed in the microwave. Worst Chilis experience I've had.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20
Lindzey H.,"Harker Heights, TX",0,49,17,2.0,3/30/2016,"Been here a handful of times because it's so close to my office. Each and every time the same. SLOW SLOW SLOW. Definitely don't plan on coming during the work week if you have a timed lunch. The servers are definitely not the friendliest. I wish I could say I've had at least one pleasant one, but sadly, none of them have really been on top of their game. Three times in a row, something has been wrong with my order, and I'm a pretty simple guest to deal with... things like no mayo, no cheese...that's all I ask for. So, that is saying a lot. Drinks take forever to get filled. It takes forever to get the check, especially if you are coming with a group. Then I always get an attitude, like how dare I want what I actually asked for, or want the check....  And... can someone PLEASE PLEASE talk to the staff about personal hygiene??? When we went for lunch recently the waiters breath was SO BAD I smelt it 5 chairs away, and literally gagged because I was not expecting it. It did not get better the duration of our visit. Just....gross. Also, a skillet dish we ordered was brought with the potholder handle soaking wet! So nasty.... Love LOVE Chili's but this place needs some serious improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20
Matt S.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",3,57,10,2.0,1/26/2015,"Good service and good food, relatively fast at lunch but horrible/ terribly slow service at night. The place was empty and now I know why. The manager walked by once but never asked about service or food. 20 minutes in we got water and soft drinks. 30 minutes in still no beer/wine. Wrong drinks. Food 40 min in completely wrong order for everyone at the table. Multiple steaks incorrectly cooked. Wrong sides. The manager is bartending (poorly) instead of managing. Lunch again? Sure. Dinner again? Never. Fire the dinner crew including the cook and ""manager"" and let me know. Update.

Amanda G.,"Pierce, WA",30,24,3,1.0,1/3/2016,If you have 2 hours to spare then come eat here. I have never gotten out of here without spending 2 hours and this is with a party of 3.

Spencer G.,"Fort Hood, TX",0,1,,4.0,3/13/2016,"I'll keep this review short and sweet.  I gave this restaurant 4 stars because of service and proximity to where I'm located.  Food- The food has been great everything tasted better than expected.  Price- Everything is priced so that even a private can eat like a king for a day.  Drinks- My only complaint is that the drinks could be a little stronger. I order the Margarita presidente, it has been one of the better margarita I've had in a while it could just use more kick. Draft selection is very minimum. The happy hour is o.k.  And is only Available if you sit at the bar or high tops. Which makes no sense but I digress.

Precious J.,"Arlington, TX",46,273,861,1.0,6/22/2015,"So.... I decided to try this location because I did not want to fight the traffic to get back on post (really wanted Pho but hey). I am not a Chilli's fan and have not eaten at on in..... I have no idea how long ago. First, I want to thank the faithful Yelpers who rarely steer me wrong but my curiosity and hunger took over this time. I just wanted a good, tasty salad and didn't want to go to Food Court. Anyway, from entry the lady was nice and seated me quickly but why not it was 11:00. Now, a big clue is when Soldiers are not swarming a restaurant (sign to stay away) but I figured it's a Monday and still early and didn't think twice. The place smelled like sour mop and I absolutely hate that smell but I stayed. Before I was taken to the booth I went use the restroom. I was attacked by a fly on the way there and inside there were two rolls of industrial paper towels not sure why they weren't placed in the dispenser???!!  So I sit and order, the waitress was nice and attentive. I ordered water with lemon and the Santa Fe Chicken salad. The fork and knife was wrapped in a napkin like usually but after unraveling the napkin, I noticed the fork was dirty so I walked up to the bar where the waitress was and asked for a new set of utensils. So, on first look the salad appeared appeasing. After running in this Texas heat this morning and skipping breakfast (not intentional) I just wants to eat. Well, the grilled chicken was nicely seasoned and looked good but was not cooked. Some pieces were pink in the inside and others tasted like undercooked mush. I decided to eat the salad itself. The spinach tasted as if it was not washed properly. That fly who attacked me near the restroom had now followed me to the table. I was annoyed, did not finish the salad, paid and left. Now you may ask why not say anything.... I did not have time to wait for another salad to be prepared, I did not feel like discussing the issue with the manager over an $8 salad at a place I will never revisit. BLUF (That's bottom line up front for my civilian friends) STAY AWAY!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20
Jolanda W.,"Honolulu, HI",76,2,,1.0,5/27/2015,"First day in town and wanted a good salad. The Santa Fe Chicken Salad is a pretty consistent menu item that packs flavor with some good leafy greens. Unfortunately, this Chili's failed to deliver on a staple menu item. No avocado on the salad and both the ranch and Santa Fe dressings were watered-down with very little flavor. To top it all off, the tortilla strips that were sprinkled on the salad were stale. My husband had already had a bad dining in experience but I decided to give them a try. This will be my first and last time dining in this restaurant in any capacity. It was just a bad time all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=20

Kayla was the best, and is a reason to come back, I can't stress enough how fantastic she is, she is an asset to the company. KAYLA! Thank you for making our first day in Texas fabulous.

We entered the restaurant with our to-go order and asked for a table. Our greeting was lacking any enthusiasm to serve us. She immediately thought she was going to get screwed out of a tip. Not the case but we got no service regardless. I had to catch her to get us some drinks and she came back at least 4 times to the table seated near us to check on them while continuing to ignore us. We even ordered beer and drinks. She never once asked what we needed. We were visited by the manager early on in the visit and had I realized how often we would be ignored, I would've addressed it with him. On top of it, the fries were ice cold. Bummer.

Dani F.,"Fort Hood, TX",62,30,11,2.0,5/2/2014,"Hubby and I went for lunch today about 1:15. Pretty slow but we sat at the bar just out of habit. We were the only ones and soon discovered why. The bartender Micha was one of the rudest people working in the food service industry. Complete negative personality and sucked the life out if our dining experience. She literally could not be bothered to look up at us. It was painful to see her work knowing she probably would rather be getting a root canal. It was uncomfortable asking her for anything and even more awkward having to leave a tip for someone that caused us to leave in a bad mood.  The food was ok... nothing more but probably would have tasted better if our server hadn't put such a bad taste in our mouth to begin with. Hate Pepsi products! Tea was cheap and weak. Micha almost dropped my husbands chicken fried steak and the bread fell off and instead of apologizing or anything she just mumbled ""That'll take a few minutes."" She obviously forgot about it but my husband was so aggravated with her attitude he didn't even ask her about it. The other staff seemed too comfortable- talking really loud and about personal issues when it was so quiet and slow.  I would go back because we do like Chili's but if I saw Micha I would get a booth. She's really that bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood?start=40

No problems there. When I arrived, It was not ready at the time prescribed. The bartender gave me my order and I left the store, only to get all the way home and discover my order was not correct. My Order of FULL SHRIMP was missing, and steak overcooked. I ordered medium and it was well done; no pink in the center whatsoever. I called the store back to inquire about my missing item. The server who answered the phone was laughing, and said ""oh, I just found it. Are you coming back to get it?"" I said of course. Then I arrive back to the store to get the rest of my order, and the doors are locked. So I had to call the store again, to have them bring my food to the door. And to top off the night, I get all the way back home again, and I discover I only have a half order of shrimp. It is quite clear additional training is needed at this location. It's like a bunch of teenagers running this place. I don't plan to eat here again, and I'm not really surprise by the lack of competence, it is on a military base.

The staff here has been very nice, and helpful. Admittedly, they had some missing ingredients for the margarita's the wife wanted the first time, but the staff was great about coming up with (an admittedly superior) alternative. Food was great! I've been in now for specials and regular menu items, and everything came out quite well.  Drinks, tougher to call. If you like the hard drinks, this place has great options (obviously margarita's). Beers, a bit weak, though maybe I'm being harsh here. There's just not many options..particular if you want to avoid the Big 3 names (Miller, Bud, Coors), like I do. They DID have a regional Texan beer though, which was awesome, so I can't take too much away from them here Really, this is a good option for anyone, particularly on-post.

Bobby S.,"Killeen, TX",2,49,5,1.0,8/18/2017,Sorry but I feel for the staff at this location on a Friday night while it's not even that busy the waitress says they are short and there are only 2 waitresses and the bartender.  We left after being seated and waiting 15 mins and no one coming up to even take a drink order.  This place is on a military installation and I'm sorry but chiles needs to have more staff. There is no excuse for having only 2 waitresses on and the bartender. I can't blame the staff. They were busy even though it wasn't that busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Cassandra C.,"Killeen, TX",88,5,,1.0,8/9/2017,Slow slow slow service  The last time we were there it took 20 min to get a waitress and I had to go ask for one. Lunch takes at least 2 hours.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Eve B.,"Fort Hood, TX",186,376,101,2.0,11/19/2016,Been here Now 3 times.. good - but hamburgers were over cooked 2 times before tonight here to get dinner and ordered hamburgers.. staff is slow but they are friendly . If you come in a big group be prepared for half the group to be served before the other half of the group does.. sometimes they do forget to bring you what you ordered. Also if you are here to eat and order a Togo meal.. it does take longer to get your take out order so order everything at the same time and hope it is don so now still waiting for my order but everyone who ordered after me has gotten their order and gone . Also they made a mistake on an order and good thing he checked .. they re made the order before I got mine ..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Jeffery P.,"Frisco, TX",57,9,2,1.0,5/19/2017,"Worst Chilis ever.  I heard they were not giving bonuses because they don't make money.  They close at 9 and stop making foods at 8.  No wonder it's always empty, it's a waste of time to go here.  Tried to get a bowl of chili an hour before closing and they said it was too old to serve.  WTF?  No soups, no chili, basically only high dollar foods after 7 pm.  Been eating the Terlingua chili since I was 5 years old ... 42 years ago... and I can't even get chili at Chilis.  Poor management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Shay L.,"Cameron, NC",0,97,44,2.0,5/19/2017,"I've never decided not to go back to a restaurant over the condition of the floors but if I can skate across it in tennis shoes, it's time to scrub.  Greasy floors? Why? I mean, Mop and Glow,  Mr Clean, Pine Sol, Dove, whatever it takes. For a restaurant to have greasy floors is unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Amanda G.,"Fort Hood, TX",0,7,3,1.0,2/23/2017,"If I could leave no stars I would. The burger was raw, wait staff took so long we had to ask for our bill so we could leave. Over changed for menu items and blamed it on them being independent and not a franchise. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Ralph C.,"Harker Heights, TX",1,18,58,1.0,7/20/2016,"Why is this place even here!?! The worst service, no one cares when you address their short comings. The men's bathroom looked like the one on  ""Train Spotting"" the floor is grease slippery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Paige G.,"Orlando, FL",71,161,1672,1.0,4/6/2016,"If you're craving Chili's don't go to this location! I've made the mistake one too many times of ordering from this location, rather then the one off post, due to pure convience. Thankfully I've come to my senses and refuse to eat here. My husband ordered a tea to go with his meal and it tasted like someone put a dirty dish towel in it. When we asked for a new tea the to go person started arguing with him over the taste of the tea. Another time, my husband bit into a metal shard in his fish and I asked for extra tomatoes on my salad, but ended up with none. One thing you don't want to do is mess with my tomatoes, lol. The tables are always dirty when we go in and none of the employees look happy to be there. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra fifteen minutes off post. Your taste buds will thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Brock S.,"Round Rock, TX",1,54,,5.0,1/9/2017,"Excellent service tonight even with the national championship game going on.  Our waitress, Chekenya, was awesome.  Food was good, too! Best experience we've had at a Chili's in a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Kurt B.,"Bulverde, TX",0,18,,1.0,6/5/2017,"In my 45+ years of dining out, I can say without doubt this was the worst experience ever. Waited for 20 minutes to get drinks, and cancelled them, then I was begged repeatedly to take them, never offered anything else to drink. Waited almost an hour for food, only to get somebody else order. . Our kids never got their fries, and their burgers were not dressed as they ordered them. Some of us finished eating before others meals came out. We ordered chicken and shrimp fajitas, and got something that looked like  cheese soup with sliced onions and green peppers in it, we had to search for meat....Then they brought us more cheese.??? The absolute worst part was that the staff was entirely oblivious to any issue, because they didn't return until we were walking out. My instinct was to start raising hell, but because I was a guest on a military base, I restrained myself, I didn't want MP's to arrest me for terrorist threats. this place is a disaster, a waste of my families time, we went to Dairy Queen to feed the rest of the family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Tiffany T.,"Fort Leonard Wood, MO",53,226,27,3.0,9/5/2016,We only come here for drinks. It's in walking distance from the barracks so no chance of a drinking and driving. This Chili's seems to lack a little in cleanliness. The bar seems to not be wiped down after every guest. The Corona-ritas are always tasty and the TV selection is always a plus for the sports games.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Roxanne P.,"Killeen, TX",29,45,142,1.0,11/4/2016,Legit the worst! I'm assuming servers don't work for tips since the service is SO BAD!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Tiffany L.,"Kingwood, TX",74,13,7,1.0,7/26/2016,Worst experience where at chilis. I ordered egg rolls and quesadillas. They messed up the order and when I went back in to address the issue it was fixed. The manager told me as I was leaving to let her know how I liked my egg rolls because she personally cooked them. She said it in a way that made me throw away my food and walk out. Will never eat or order here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
Maritza G.,"Vilseck, Germany",3,22,11,2.0,12/5/2015,"After a long ""No Chili's"" break, we decided to go have dinner there.  Service was awesome. The host could've been better. I mean, who sits a family down with a baby and not offer a high chair? Eh whatever I'm not that butt hurt about it. The waitress did her job well. Super friendly and super on point.  Now, if only the cooks had their ish together as the waitress did. I ordered the triple dipper. Had the southwestern egg rolls, chicken crispers and honey buffalo bite things. The crispers were seriously ""CRISPI"", the buffalo bites were beyond toasty. I couldn't even poke them with a fork. Did I eat it? Yes. Maybe had I ordered a Patron Margarita I wouldn't had noticed how terrible the food was.  Walked out whispering to my husband.....""now I remember why we stopped coming here""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood

Ann N.,"Killeen, TX",34,159,395,3.0,10/1/2014,"We have visited this location several times and the service has always been good. The food is always very tasty as well.  On this day, my husband enjoyed his chicken crispers which were sweet and tangy. Our appetizer hit the spot as well which was the panko breaded onion rings. I had the Mango-Chile Chicken which is usually delicious except on this day. The rice had a strange plastic taste to it. Also, the broccoli had very visible mold spores throughout (posted a photo of it.) I'm sure the front of the house service would have been more than happy to swap it but unfortunately, I lost my appetite. This is the only incident I've ever experienced with Chili's throughout the years. I will continue to enjoy meals there but the kitchen performance just fell below expectations on this day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fort-hood
