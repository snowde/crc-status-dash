Bud H.,"Sherman, TX",0,45,3,4.0,12/29/2017,"I'm always impressed with service, RC was fantastic. He was probably in the top 10 of all times. Food was delivered as menu, hot and tasty. The place was clean and well managed, we will definitely stop again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Gigi E.,"Arlington, TX",125,131,238,4.0,5/12/2017,"Gooooood margarita!! Great service! The staff was busting it today as it's graduation weekend but they were kind and quick! Ordered Prime Rib fresh mex bowl. The flavor is a spicy blend of corn, prime beef, peppers, and roasted corn. Husband ha s Ancho Salmon and said it 'was really good! Yum foodies!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
James S.,"Plano, TX",34,136,139,5.0,4/1/2017,Good consistent service and hot tastes food. I got to go tonight and it was made to order. I had egg rolls and the wife had a chicken sandwich with fries. Made my Diet Coke to go. On the weekends the same to go staff and they work hard.  Been here many times.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Leigh P.,"Dallas, TX",779,488,124,1.0,3/1/2016,"Worst Chili's ever. I spend a lot of time in the car, mostly to fetch my man's children and usually in traffic. Usually hungry, because who wants to stop to eat when you gotta haul ass to get out of town. This happened last Friday night, February 26. We were driving and discussing what we'd have (you know the ""what do you want, I don't know what do you want"" game)... then a Chili's sign crested the horizon and Ben promised me ""baby, when we get back here in an hour I'mma buy you the biggest, strongest margarita they got. Score, I'm in. We arrived and were sat. Well, we were sat after we walked to a 1/2 empty dining room full of dirty tables and they bussed a table for us. That's cool, they musta had a rush. We settled in and I picked out my margarita.  Waitress finally comes by and we order drinks. When they come, Hay, my margarita comes in this cute shaker that looks like a patron bottle. How sweet. First sip is 100% mix. I stir it around and pour another swig into the little glass (maybe it wasn't mixed well). Again, sickening sweet and no alcohol. I never complain and I don't need a drink to knock my head off... but c'mon, for the fanciest best margarita you got, you should get a hint of tequila. I called the waitress over and said ""hey, i never complain and I hate to ask, but can you check this? It's seriously only mix"". The waitress told me ""I saw them make it, they put tequila in it"". Ok so now we're gonna argue about it. Look, I'm not trying to get my swerve on the I35 Gainesville Chili's, lady, I just don't want to pay for a $12 (?) margarita that tastes like mix (never mind the caloric sacrifice for nothin').  I told her i wasn't gonna drink it and she could take it away. She came back and said that the bartender said there was tequila in it, a whole 1 1/4 ounce! And I think she said cointreau, I'm not sure. Can you imagine one ounce of alcohol in a shaker that looks like this:  . Worthless. Once we had our little margarita discussion, she was done with us. PISSED. Slammed drinks down. Ignored us. All the while the restaurant stayed horribly dirty. And then the smart ass bartendress with horrible short hair cut (but a clip to add that special something) had domino's delivered. And then openly ate it in the bar area. Isn't that breaking some cleanliness rules? Not to mention give customers some great confidence in the dinner they are about to eat.  *sigh* if this was a great (hell, even a decent) experience, this could have been a stopping spot for us and our many bimonthly trips between Rockwall, TX and Ardmore, OK. Now every time I pass by i'll just HISS and remember how it'll be a cold day in hell before I go there again. Chili's Corporate, are you listening?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Stephen M.,"Monroe, NC",0,22,19,5.0,3/15/2017,Greeted immediately. Fast service by very nice waitress Halie who was very attentive. Fajitas were delicious and served timely. I will return when I come back through.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Riley L.,"Denton, TX",128,176,58,3.0,9/26/2016,"This Chili's is COLD inside. I don't know what's going with the AC here, but it's a ridiculous.  I haven't had the same problems with my food as other people have had here, but I'm a really basic eater and I usually just order tea and a burger. That said, it's not a place I would recommend to anyone unless they're just craving a specific Chili's dish, because they make cheeseburgers and chicken crispers the same as every other Chili's. I don't think it's better or worse than any other location, but it doesn't stand out. Plus, now you can go a few hundred feet away to Rib Crib, and they're awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Jennifer F.,"Valley View, TX",88,17,3,5.0,4/26/2017,Love this place! Consistent service and food! We love eating here. A wide variety of food and it's always yummy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Jon K.,"Denton, TX",0,3,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Ordered 1 hour before my pickup time (to-go). Waited in the to go area for 15 minutes without being acknowledged. Finally called the restaurant while standing there, manager answers and I tell him I would like to get my order (we order to go so we don't have to wait). Absolutely terrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
JP P.,"Tioga, TX",0,14,7,1.0,12/22/2016,"Felons, French Fries and Forget this place. Slow slow slow. Food ok. Wonder how many appetizers or free desserts are given away. I will say the management is very friendly just seems waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay understaffed....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Jean M.,"Minco, OK",0,1,,1.0,4/29/2017,"This was the worst meal we have every had. Steak was touch, potato soup looked and tasted like puck. Salads need to go back to iceberg lettuce. Tea was good. Daughter in law got sick on the pork tacos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Richard B.,"Alvord, TX",0,39,1,2.0,5/15/2017,Not so great. Did lunch and the waitress was standoffish and seemed to be in a rush. Was there for a biz lunch and needed some time but no doubt I was rushed. Food was average. Will go next door next time. Two stars just for the food. At least it wasn't cold.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Kk H.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,9,,3.0,7/25/2016,"My husband I ate here (Gainesville, Tx) on Saturday night on our way to Stillwater, Ok from Fort Worth. We were hungry and not sure about any of the other sit down restaurants (there were not many that we could see) in the area. We had pretty much given up eating at Chili's in the past 2 years because of mediocre food and service at 4 different Chili's (2 in Ok and 2 in our neighborhood.).  This is a small Chili's and there was a wait of about 10 minutes for the two of us which no big deal, but we needed to be on the road so we sat at the bar. Good decision. We could watch our Rangers on tv and the bartender Paul was very nice and provided great service.  We ordered the 2 for $20 and were pretty satisfied with it. I had chicken fajitas and my husband had the original crispers. We had chips and salsa which are always way too salty, but still good.  All in all a good experience and we really liked Paul.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
L. G.,"Windsor, CA",0,22,,1.0,3/28/2015,"I went there for nachos, after an all day nachos craving. We ordered and were delivered 12 nacho chips arranged in a circle on a plate. Total disappointment! The waitress noticed our four shocked expressions and asked what was wrong. When we explained these were NOT real nachos, she had no clue what real nachos looked like! Her manager then came over and said HE also had no clue what real nachos look like. I left them and drove STRAIGHT to Denny's for REAL nachos! Hey, folks at Chili's... visit Denny's to find out what real nachos look like!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Misty D.,"Argyle, TX",38,273,186,2.0,6/20/2015,"This used to be our go-to place to stop on our way back from Winstar.   We frequent several Chili's restaurants depending on what part of DFW we are in that day and enjoy sitting at the bar and having a beer/wine and a bite to eat.  Most of them, we know the bar tenders and they know us.  That used to be the case at this Gainesville location, but not anymore.  The past several times we've stopped, the bar service has been terrible, and the last 2 times, we've left.  The last time we were there the bar area smelled terrible and it was freezing cold.  We never saw a bar tender and left.  We will probably stop again next time we go to Winstar to see if they've gotten it fixed, because we're pretty loyal to our regular places.  I look forward to them getting it figured out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Chris C.,"Marietta, OK",7,79,27,2.0,2/2/2016,"We used to come here all the time but finally got fed up with getting our meals minutes after the appetizer, or getting it cold.  Decided to give it another try and sat down to an all new menu.  The server took our drink orders and came right back with them and asked if we were ready to order. I asked for a minute.  I should have asked for two, because he was back in about 60 seconds and we still had not decided.  20 minutes later it was like he was doing his best to avoid going anywhere near our table and actually checked with 2 other tables twice after they had their food - all while we still had not ordered.  We left after 30 minutes, without ordering, when he was looking at the TV.  We have had good service and food here in the past, but I'm just not liking my odds of getting a good meal and service here lately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Ian M.,"Belleville, IL",0,2,,1.0,7/15/2015,"This is the worst Chilis I have ever encountered and I eat at them all over the country.  My appetizer finally arrived and was fresh out of the oven( excellent) however my meal arrived less than two minutes later before I could get my first bite of the appetizer. So I set it aside and went for my meal the broccoli was cool. The chicken was also cool and dried out or had freezer burn. After two bites I pushed it aside and waited for her return. She never came. Neither did either of the two managers who were engrossed in conversation over watching the restaurant. A full twenty minutes later when the waitress appeared I asked for a box for my untouched appetizer and she said ""one or two"" I said "" one this (pointing at the chicken) was crap"" she responded by repeating it and giggling then walked away and returned with my box and my bill without any adjustment and left. I looked at the two managers and when I was sure one was looking at me I shook my head in disgust. Apparently that was too subtle because still no one came over. I left a $1 tip and left all the while shaking my head.  Obviously customer service and experience is not on their priority list.  I would not have asked for an adjustment however I would have at least expected the offer of one or the waitress to inform management when an barely touched meal is referred to as crap.  Go elsewhere is my recommendation",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
DeeDee D.,"Denton, TX",44,32,5,2.0,1/24/2015,"Not one of my favorite Chilis. My son and I have been Chili fans for long time but this location leaves a bit to be desired. The service is not that good. The servers lack enthusiasm or any character and maybe half the time get your order correct. They rarely check back on you, but to be fair, most servers at most restaurants in this area are not that great. Although my past visit our server was great. She had just transferred from the Dallas area. The new homemade pickles are gross and fried they were disgusting. Both me and my co-worker got sick on them. The food is rarely cooked that great at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Lorena M.,"Midlothian, TX",0,26,1,3.0,2/1/2016,"The building is your standard chilis restaurant. The service when you eat in is pretty good, but to-go service is a completely different story! I've ordered to-go a couple of times and each time was forgotten about. When you walk in the to-go entrance, no one is ever manning the desk and there are employees walking around all over the place ignoring you. You never really know if someone is working on your order or not unless you stop someone to ask. The most recent time I went to pick up my order, someone finally came out and told me it would be 15 more minutes. I waited patiently and an extra 30 minutes had gone by. Employees were clocking out right in front of me and no one asked me if I needed any help. I finally asked the bartender if he would check on my order. He found my order just sitting in the kitchen and it had been forgotten. He apologized, but they really should come up with a better system.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
Meghan S.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2016,"We went in the middle of the afternoon, in the middle of the week, the restaurant wasn't even half full, and we still received horrendous service.  We arrived at 2:30 and after waiting several minutes to be greeted once at our table, were told that we could get happy hour prices on our drinks, but only if we moved to the bar area. We did so, which resulted in waiting even longer due to switching servers, and we could tell from the beginning that we had irritated the bar server. We explained that we were advised to move for happy hour, she acknowledged us and proceeded to order our drinks. Apart from our drink order, everything else went downhill. It took forever for us to be able to order our food, once our order came to the table there were condiments missing which we asked for, and again took absolutely forever to get. While waiting I curiously looked at our bill on the electronic table system, and found that our drinks were not at happy hour prices. When asking the server she told us that we had put our order in at about 2:30 (which wasn't true because we walked in the door at 2:30), and happy hour didn't start until 3:00. We explained that we were told that it had already started, which was the whole reason as to our move to the bar. She told us that ""there were signs all over the restaurant"" (none of which were visible at all in the bar, the e-system even stated to ask our server for details) and that she ""would talk to her manager, but she'll probably just tell us to deal with it."" After several more minutes the manager came to our table with a very confrontational attitude, told us that it was misinformation on the previous server's part, that happy hour is at 3:00, and that ""comping makes her look bad, but she went ahead and comped our drinks to happy hour prices."" She then told us that it was ""this time only, not again,"" and told us to forgive them as she walked off. Afterwards the server refused to check on our table and after waiting 20 minutes we had to go ask her for to go boxes. We had two beers and a margarita, which cost the company $5.00 to discount to happy hour prices. I worked as a server for several years and know how stressful of a job it can be, however there was no reason for the poor service on the server's part, and absolutely no reason at all for the confrontational behavior on the manager's part, especially when it was the company's mistake. We were incredibly surprised at their lack customer service, and will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville
John W.,"Gainesville, TX",7,3,,5.0,1/10/2014,"This Timothy guy doesn't know what he's talking about, Cooke county is NOT a dry county, as we all know, and Chili's is a damn good restaurant.

Timothy S.,"Madison, WI",15,446,,1.0,3/4/2011,"Welcome to Texas!  Welcome to 1920! We stopped here on our way to Dallas.  We had been driving a long time and the beer signs in the windows of this this Chili's said ""come in, relax and have a cold one.""   So we went in to find out that this is a dry county.  I know these antiquated laws still exist but to be honest I didn't expect them to be here.  Boy was I wrong.  Texas really has a bunch of whining do-gooders yet and low and behold I couldn't have a beer unless I joined the drinker's club for 10 dollars.  I know it isn't much but it is the principle of the thing.   So we left.  Have no idea how their food tastes and don't care.  I know it isn't entirely Chili's fault but it still was a big disappointment.  You would think they would allow people from out of state to at least have a beer or get a free pass or something.   Seems like really bad business to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville?start=20
