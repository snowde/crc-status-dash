Richard G.,"Texas City, TX",0,14,,4.0,1/25/2015,"This is my favorite Chili's in the Galveston/Houston area. The food and service are consistently good. I like the remodeling inside, it's more open now and better views of the gulf. I had the Santa Fe chicken salad, the sauce does have a kick (menu says it's spicy), I liked my wife's Quesadilla Explosion salad. Both servings were huge, couldn't finish it. Small nacho appetizer with just bean and cheese was real good. Manager checked in on us and the waitress was real nice and gave us some food recommendations. Will probably get some ribs next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston?start=40
Carson C.,"Shawnee, OK",0,5,,1.0,7/31/2014,Terrible. That's all I can say. The service is the worst of any restaurant I have ever been to. Host is never at the front. Wait staff is so slow. We showed up at 9:05 tonight and walked out at 9:30 without ever seeing our drinks. Manager watched us get up and didn't even care.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston?start=40
Avinash R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",41,33,3,4.0,9/4/2011,"Well, I would give this place 1 star, but the manager made up for it in the end.  Chili's is Chili's - the food is pretty much the same everywhere.  But, this place took almost 1 hour to bring out our food, and the food was cold (3 of the 4 entrees were, at least).  But they quickly whisked away the food and within 10 minutes they returned with WARM food, that tasted good.  On top of that the manager took $30 off (more than 1/2) of the check to make it up to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston?start=40
Jack W.,"Denver, CO",1,14,4,1.0,4/19/2014,"Every time I've been to this location, they tell tell me that they are short of wait staff. And they've even gone to the lengths of telling me that they are short of wait staff because an employee went to the ER. Let's not be fooled,this is not about lack of staff; it's about profitability. If you want to become more profitable, you should run the best staff possible. You are losing customers because you have subpar and insufficient staff. Fuck you Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston?start=40
Kunal T.,"Round Rock, TX",39,16,2,3.0,9/5/2011,We ate at the Chili's yesterday and it was a little crowded as it was a labor day weekend. The food overall was okay as it took almost an hour for the staff to bring our food and it was cold. The management took this to their notice and brought our food back within few mins this time the food was hot and tasted good as well. On my final check they gave me a 50% off and sincerely apologized for the food. I think at the end it was okay they rectified and understood their mistake and well its a long weekend holiday and things can slip off sometimes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston?start=40
Marlis L.,"Galveston, TX",0,3,,3.0,3/13/2014,The food was fresh and well seasoned. We did not have to wait long and the staff was friendly. We are Islander and we would definitely go back. ..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston?start=40
Jyreka N.,"Houston, TX",95,40,42,3.0,6/25/2013,"Wasn't my best experience at Chili's, the only reason why I gave a good tip was because the manager was so kind enough to correct our waitress mistake. (I wish I would have gotten his name! He was a tall Caucasian man with brown hair I believe.) Not only did it take us over 10 minutes to be greeted at the door, we had to sit in the bar with flies constantly swarming us but the server, Bailie, was pathetic at best! She was so inattentive! Didn't check on our us if the food was good, took 15 minutes for a refill? Seriously? I tried to be patient but my god! How clueless can you be, then finally the last straw I just wanted to pay and leave, but my fiancé wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. She brought out these disgusting Texas cheese fries that were clearly close to burnt! Why would you bring them to us if you, yourself wouldn't even eat them? She was just a horrible host all together, I'm sorry. There's no way a server can be THAT bad. The waiter servering nearby tables was great, I was so jealous! We called a manager to the table and he fixed the problem right up, no questions asked. Loved it. Promptly then and apologized. That's what sold me, I live in Galveston & love Chili's. If not for him I would have recommended people to stay away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston?start=40

Au N.,"Orlando, FL",0,59,2,3.0,10/16/2011,"The margaritas were the highlight of the night. The food is just ok...don't expect a gourmet dinner. Food is tasty but too salty. Our rib-eyes were too well done, the broccoli looks like it was once frozen, the garlic bread is also generic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston?start=40
Chantal F.,"Galveston, TX",0,26,,4.0,1/6/2018,I gave it four stars because I tried something totally different. It was the chipotle crispers with waffles. It was so freaking good! The consistency was something I really didn't expect. Very sweet but spicy I enjoyed it more than I thought. I would truly get it again and of course the salted caramel molten cake!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston
Long N.,"Galveston, TX",15,104,60,4.0,1/25/2017,TLDR: food is mediocre. Price is mediocre. Pleasant place to hang with friends/date.  Area: (4/5) parking is not too hard to find. Getting a booth sometimes can be difficult as the place does get crowded at peak time (dinner). Tables are relatively clean so no complaints there.  Service: (5/5) waiters/waitresses aren't TOO annoying and not TOO unresponsive. This is my 3rd or 4th time this past year (late 2016 to early 2017 as of now).  Food: (4/5)  I honestly forgot what I ordered the first couple of times but it wasn't too bad or too spectacular.  I write this review as of now for my $10 dinner special. This includes a choice of chips/salsa or side salad + half rack ribs/burger/chicken tenders+ sundae chocolate cake for a measly price of $10 (excluding tip). Chips were plain but can't complain. The salsa was pretty flavorful but needs to be spicier. I ordered half rack ribs with Craft Beer Sauce and side of fries. Fries were fries. You can't really mess up on those. The ribs however... the sauce was decent. The ribs itself came out warm. It also tasted dry and bland and there was not enough sauce to mask the dry blandness. Disappointed. The chocolate cake though was the bomb. Came out hot and fresh. Melted chocolate in the middle and a small spoon of vanilla ice cream that was melting.  I did not review and revise to save time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston
Cristina F.,"Galveston, TX",49,13,24,1.0,4/24/2017,New roasted corn is a lie! It is not roasted it is the same boiled corn on the cob put on the grill to add color like it was roasted. Corn is still a watery mushy mess.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston

Fernando A.,"Western Hills/Ridglea, Fort Worth, TX",82,55,113,3.0,7/31/2016,"This is not the best place to come to eat, wow !! I was expecting more. Today was no wait in whatsoever and that's good!

May J.,"Pensacola, FL",0,112,159,3.0,6/11/2017,Funny that people complain about a Sysco quality menu priced accordingly. You get what you pay for!! We only go here when we want a step up from fast food on a budget. OPF all the way!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston
Paki G.,"Perrysburg, OH",0,22,,5.0,4/7/2017,I love the place and ambiance! You can sit in bar and watch the ocean and tv at the same time. Waiters treat you like a family. Owner is very proactive and makes sure that you are satisfied. Sometimes you have to wait a bit longer but it totally worth it. MUST VISIT! Santa Fe salad and burgers are the best!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston
Brenda M.,"Galveston, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/27/2017,"Went to have dinner with my family . Ordered our drinks and an appetizer . That came out fairly quick. After that. My sons food came out , meanwhile we waited for about an hour and a half with nothing. Not even a refill. What really sucked over all was the fact that our waitress Nicole wouldn't even acknowledge us.  I wouldn't waste my time or money going there again. We canceled the rest of our order paid and left. Took way too long and had horrible service. If you don't have peoples skills you shouldn't be waiting tables. I hope the manager on duty brings it to her attention. Because if not she's part of the problem as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston
Naught W.,"Corpus Christi, TX",12,18,1,1.0,10/2/2016,"My daughter wanted to try it again. The boy working the door/ seating never said a single word, he didn't say hi when we walked in, waited for us to tell him how many, didn't say who our waiter would be, not a word. Not even when he was told to bring our boxes. We always say hi and thank you, we are southern after all, so he had chances.  Our waiter Chris did the best he could with what he was given. He had a smile and offered lighthearted jokes. He was on top of our drink refills and all. There's no excuse or reason that appetizers should take more than a half hour. The manager apparently was watching and came by to say he was gonna check on our food... And he did bring it out promptly. The loaded fajitas are yummy, but they only plated one of our meats. The prime took another fifteen minutes and it was burnt and dry when we did get it. From what we could see, our waiter had most of his tables on the main floor, why they gave him us in the far side of the bar, (or why we were even sat there) I don't know. My daughter guessed that maybe they think since it was a game day, maybe they expected that we were there to chill, and maybe they thought we didn't expect speedy service.  Plain and simple, this kitchen sucks and there's too many employees with crappy attitudes. Definitely not tourist town worthy. (Usually restaurants are on top of it all since there's so much competition)  Oh well",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston
Maegan-Yvonne C.,"Stafford, TX",16,7,,1.0,9/23/2016,"Got food poising off of their grilled chicken mango dish that had a side of brown rice and broccoli. Called this morning and spoke with the manager about the issue and he said he would ""check on it"" and didn't offer anything else. I used to work in a restaurant and by saying that i guess it means my issue was not important. I basically paid to get sick here. I will be advancing this issue soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston
Donna B.,"Whitewright, TX",0,2,,4.0,7/11/2017,Great service and good food and drink. Only complaint was the salsa and queso. Salsa tasted like it was from a jar. Not as good as I am use to from Chilis. Queso was not good at all. Didn't resemble or taste like any queso I have ever had. Entrees were awesome. Overall a good experience and I would give it another try.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston

Aisha P.,"Galveston, TX",0,24,8,1.0,5/9/2017,"This location was not a good one. I went several times and had a normal experience. However the last time I went was about a year ago and it was not a good one. We were seated immediately but then waited about 30 minutes for our waiter to take our orders and another 30min for the food to arrive. So it was about an hour before we were eating. That would have been fine if they were busy but they were not. And they had more than one server. It was about 7-8 other customers and 3pm on a weekday. Luckily my friend and i were catching up on old times and didnt not notice he never returned to check on us. I think maybe an hour later he finally came back to let us know we could pay using the system on the table. He was cordial enough but I have never returned. We were sat in a table by the bathroom far from the other 7 or 8 people there. It was odd and though I have thought about going back, my mind always returns to that experience and I have not returned. Dont plan on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston
Jen B.,"Monterey, TN",21,191,159,1.0,1/20/2016,The worst chilis I've ever been too. Got my order wrong. Brought me chicken when I ordered fish.

Ryan B.,"Galveston, TX",1,5,,1.0,6/23/2016,"This is the most disgusting Chili's I have ever frequented.  Terrible, unkept servers who don't mind having customers sitting in their section where 3 of their tables were never bussed for the entire meal.  The ""manager"" walked by several times and never lifted a finger or lit a fire under the server's behind.  With stellar management like that, why would you expect the server's to care.  Gross place, don't waste your time or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston

Eric G.,"Montgomery, TX",26,2,,1.0,10/18/2015,"Worst Chilis I have been to. Bad customer service from the beginning. At first the host seemed and she was having a bad day, no greet no nothing just plain ole ""how many people?"". They forgot our fries the whole time we were there (an hour). Only once did we get a refill of our beverages and it was literally minutes before paying our check. Changing subject, I ordered wings as my entree. If you have eaten wings you know that you will need more then one napkin. The only napkin that I received was the one that came with the silverware (waitress never came by to ask us for anything so I was never able to ask her myself.) Back to the original subject.

Megan W.,"Galveston, TX",35,1,,1.0,7/7/2015,I will no longer eat at the Chili's in Galveston knowing that they hired a woman who has been charged with murder and is awaiting trial for shooting her boyfriend in the head(which she confessed to) in front of her 5 year old son is sickening! Chili's should be ashamed of hiring such a low life person and threat to society and still expect people to feel welcomed while there. Shame on y'all!

Becky R.,"Santa Fe, TX",0,11,1,3.0,8/27/2014,"Food is always good and cokes are sweet like I like them. The only complaint I have is that the waiters interrupt me non stop to see how I am doing. I hate being interrupted and could never tell a complete story to my cousin that I have not seen in months!!  If my drink is full and I am not looking at you, then keep walking.  If my drink is empty I'll sit it on the edge of the table so you can take it to be refilled. That simple. Then when it comes time for the check the waiters disappears!! Imagine that.  They want to hang around and tell me their names & ask me tons of questions, then when it's time for me to get back to work they are long gone.

The food is the same at every chilis, it's good but not good enough to have terrible service. I walked in tonight with my boyfriend (there was no wait and the restaurant was about half full) we were sat in the very back at the smallest booth closest to the kitchen. We were told our waitress would be right with us. (Lie) we sat there for 6 or 7 minutes without any acknowledgement. There were 3 waiters AND a manager who not only walked past us but made eye contact with us multiple times (as well as noticing we had no drinks) and said nothing, so we got up and left.

Allison B.,"Galveston, TX",13,86,11,2.0,6/24/2013,"Ok, I went here last night. I live here in Galveston and this is only the second time I've eaten here. I only went because I had a coupon for a free flatbread pizza.   First impressions were bad! When I walked in there were probably 10 people waiting already to be seated. There was not a hostess at the front. A waitress had to go back and get her. Since I was alone I said I could just sit at the bar. She told me I could not do that because there was a wait to sit everywhere. We were told that they were short staffed.  (Apparently that means that she couldn't be friendly.)   I probably waited 10 more minutes and was seated.  The waitress was prompt getting my drink order and I could tell she was busy. I ordered my food when she brought my drink (to make it a little faster). Everything came out in a reasonable amount of time. The waitress didn't refill my drink until I was pretty much done with my food.   I don't think I will come back here, especially during the summer. This place should know that Galveston is busy during the summer and they should account for that when scheduling workers.

Melissa H.,"Galveston, TX",0,5,,1.0,5/9/2016,"This is the only Chili's I've been to in the past several years so I don't know if this is an issue with the entire chain or just this one. They do have some good dishes (such as their hamburgers and sandwiches) but the quality of most of their food is pretty low. I've had ""beef"" fajitas before that were clearly chicken (looked like chicken, tasted like chicken, WAS chicken) but they insisted were beef - it was bizarre. Their side dishes are always disappointing, especially the newer options like the ""Fresca"" salad, which is just shredded romaine lettuce, a bare sprinkling of cheese, and dressing. That's not worth 25 cents, IMO. A (apparently somewhat disgruntled) waitress admitted to us one day that they microwave the majority of their food - and you can tell. I don't want to pay good money for microwaved food! The only reason I ever go here is because it's so convenient to my office.

Gord C.,"Spring, TX",0,19,,1.0,3/28/2016,"The service was horrible, I don't know about the food because after an hour of waiting with two babies we finally left. The three tables around that's all got their food before us. The waitress had an attitude with us whenever we asked for the check because everyone else has gotten their food in it has been over an hour. The table that had came in right after us was Already done eating their food. The guy manager saw there was a problem at our table but never came over to ask us anything or check on us. The new manager that just came on finally did come and check on us but that was over five minutes after we had asked for her. Then the waitress tries to bring us our food that had clearly been sitting in the window after we told her we did not want our food. We even saw the waitress in the back eating her food. She did not come and check on us while we were waiting on our food or even let us know what was taking so long. We ordered a drink from the bar and took over 15 minutes to get that. If their service is going to be that bad they should at least put more alcohol in their drinks. If you see a table with babies you should try to get them in and out faster. I worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years and this is not how you treat a table. Take your chances at any other place on the seawall don't eat here. I thought we were going to go to Chili's because it would be simple and it is a chain restaurant but it was absolutely horrible. We should've went to the spot.

Kimberly L.,"Webster, TX",318,475,758,4.0,3/18/2010,"Yes, I know it's a chain restaurant. But after spending all day in Galveston with family during the start of Spring Break nonetheless, we were all tired, hungry and ready to sit down. We tried Saltgrass but after a terrible customer service experience decided to call here and see what the wait time was for a party of eight.  Surprisingly there was no wait! So we hightailed here just ready for some decent food and a place to sit down. The waitress we had was great! I wish I would have gotten her name, as she took great care of us, even bringing out an extra chips and salsa basket seeing we had kids with us who were starving! She didn't bat an eye when we said we needed the tickets split up three ways between the eight of us and got all of the special requests from the picky eaters correct! On a busy Sunday night! Wow! The food was actually very good! It was hot, flavorful and cooked just right. The portions were big so you got full for sure but not so big you felt bad about wasting any. My niece left her debit card there by accident and when she realized it, she called back and they said yes they have it and would lock it in the safe till we could come and get it. We went down the next day and picked it up no problem! I live in Webster and I would probably drive down here just to go to this Chili's because of the great food and super customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston?start=20
Ryan G.,"Galveston, TX",13,3,,1.0,2/25/2013,Food was good but the service is really bad me and my buddy came in at lunch hour and the place was packed. Have been waiting on the check now for 15min for a lunch rush this is not right. 2-6-2013,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-galveston?start=20
