Tracy C.,"Dallas, TX",782,371,115,3.0,11/24/2015,"I want my baby back ... i want my baby back... i want my baby back ribs...Chili's baby back ribs.... bbq sauce.  A jingle that sticks in my head every time i see the Chili's sign. This is a nice quick place to go when you are out on the road and your kids are hungry. WHY? they have electronic games on the table for the kids to play. WIN. The adults can actually enjoy our meals while the kids are entertained. Their food is good, the price is right, and they have BBQ sauce. need i say more?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Lynda B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,164,6,1.0,4/17/2016,"We are from Colorado.  Enjoy our Chilis at home but will not be back here again.  Can't believe they allow smoking!  YUK!!  Service wasn't the best and we sat at the bar top.  Took a bit just to be acknowledged.  The beer mug was dirty, couldn't even hold a head.  Downed our drinks and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Harry S.,"Garland, TX",4,73,1,2.0,12/10/2014,"Overpriced and poor quality. Chili's food used to be so much better before. Their burgers used to be good and they had a focused menu. Over the last year or so, they keep introducing new items and taking stuff out. I tried their new addition the sweet/smoky burger. Was not impressed at all and tasted bland for a $11 burger and that too at chili's. They need to improve their menu and ambiance a little more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20

James T.,"Garland, TX",24,11,,2.0,8/30/2014,"Stopped here for lunch and ordered beef fajitas. Wow, did the serving get smaller since the last time I ate here? Was not worth what I paid and the meat tough. Almost sent it back and I should have. Had to find my waitress to get more ice tea. Not my favorite location but I do like the hamburgers.Should have had that instead. Location not the easiest to get to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Lala B.,"Mesquite, TX",0,4,,1.0,8/28/2013,"After 45 min of waiting for our food, Cajun chicken pasta---raw chicken!!!!! AND chicken strips were CHEWY!! Waiter doesn't apologize and 10 min later brings back COLD chicken! The waiter only went to out to our table a few times in the 2 hours we were there. Definitely do NOT recommend this place to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Tim S.,"Monument, CO",64,584,22,3.0,3/14/2013,"Been to this location twice now, it's clean, service is friendly and fast, and the food is exactly what we expected.  It's a Chili's; even when they're spot-on you're not blown away and ""ooh""ing and ""ahh""ing, but this experience was better than some I've had in the area, so given a choice I will hit this one again for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
JR M.,"McKinney, TX",4,18,2,4.0,9/19/2014,Our server was very prompt and took care of everything. The food is always great and a good variety.  The rested is clean and well kept. The best part is the kiosk where you can order dessert and pay for your bill. Plus it has games for you or the kids. This is a place we frequent!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Vicki B.,"Garland, TX",0,1,,1.0,9/7/2015,"Worst service ever! We got to the restaurant to pick up our order, got there early so paid and sat down to wait. The guy that took our money sets a bag on the counter and walks away. 10 mins later when our food was suppose to be ready I get up to ask about our food and the bag he set down 10 mins before was our food!! He just sets it down and doesn't even acknowledge our food is ready. Meanwhile the servers are parting at the tables behind us. The manager leaving for the day is yelling over our heads saying goodbye to her ""wonderful"" staff. Poorly run Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20

Preston F.,"Garland, TX",3,5,2,2.0,8/16/2014,"I have ordered the cajun chicken pasta for years now and mostly not from this location but the last 3 time they have butchered the order. The alfredo sauce is wrong, thin, and today had a constancy or queso. I felt shorted on the chicken too. I asked for diced and it was half-assed. The cajun spice has been the biggest problem. They keep mixing up the cajun spice with some other kind because i tried the one in plano and it was done perfect. Thank god i have my own cajun spice at the house. Dont bother with this location because it is not anywhere close to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Walter G.,"Euless, TX",25,89,52,4.0,6/13/2014,Dame as always.  Nothing fancy just a good place to go with friends for a none expensive meal ams good time.  Service was great food was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Stephen T.,"Frisco, TX",112,134,91,3.0,12/23/2013,It's kind of like you don't expect much from Chili's .....It's food that's better than fast food and maybe more of comfort food instead of food you just have to have.  I like the lunch menu options...kind of a pick your own adventure /combo thing. This location is  easy to miss since it's tucked so close to GBush so just look for the Home Depot parking lot and wander over there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Magnus L.,"Denton, TX",95,603,258,3.0,1/22/2009,"Chili's is not very spectacular but if you're in the right mood, they aren't bad at all. Surprisingly, they were relatively busy on a Wednesday night. Their Texas Cheese Fries is pretty mean, sure to kill your arteries.  I guess I am weird, I really like their classic fajitas even though we have so many tex-mex restaurants around us. Sitting next to the kitchen, apparently quite a few of us are fans of their fajitas, it was sizzling all nite long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Molly K.,"Plano, TX",94,244,24,1.0,8/25/2012,Can we say rude!!!!! My parents and I went in today and waited for about 5 minutes to get seated. Let's just say they were not busy! Waiters and waitresses passed us. No hello no we will be right with you nothing!  We walked out and the people behind us walked out!!!! Never be back here!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Mary S.,"Garland, TX",109,223,8,1.0,12/4/2009,"Chilis is pretty much the standard for casual dining.  The menu isn't as dull as say Cheddars, but it's still predictable and safe.  The atmosphere and decor are dated.  I believe Chilis has not had a major overhaul of its interiors in over 20 years.  There have been a few minor tweaks, but you would have to really pay attention to notice.  At this point I don't think anyone knows which chain came up with the look first, but it's indistinguishable from Bennigans/Fridays/etc. My one star rating comes from the fact that I got a mad case of food poisoning at this location.  I will spare the gory details, but I'll put it this way I literally spent the night in my bathroom and had to miss work the next day.  I think I must have lost 10 pounds in 8 hours time. I contacted their HQ and never got a response, total failure in my book.  Dropping the ball on your average consumer complaint would be in bad taste.  Dropping the ball severe food poisoning is just crass.  I guess as a chain with thousands of locations they don;t really have to care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Julian O.,"Garland, TX",232,27,6,2.0,1/5/2013,"The ribs are good, but food is just okay. The service is okay. The drink good but very overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Robbin S.,"Dallas, TX",0,27,,1.0,4/5/2015,"have to agree with the other(negative) reviews. i go back once or twice a year to see if anything has improved-but nothing ever   go to is the chicken crispers,but the last time i had them here the corn on the cob was mushy,as well as the fries(which i ordered crispy). the employees seem friendly,enough,so all fault must be in the kitchen. other locations i've tried(preston rd) have excellent food/service..i agree about the high prices also-why are burgers so expensive?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7?start=20
Jeffry F.,"Garland, TX",22,12,,4.0,1/3/2018,"Don't know why this location is getting fewer ratings than the other stores, this place is great. Never had a bad experience. All the waiters are top notch. Food Is great, atmosphere is welcoming. Only complaint here is they always want to seat you on the right side, It would be nice to change up the scenery and get seated on the left side every now and then but I guess they just have enough waiters on deck to cover the one side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7
David G.,"Garland, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/12/2017,Recently a group of six stopped at this location to have dinner. As soon as you step in you notice the smell of cigarette smoke. They allow smoking in the bar area. We waited to be seated about 10 minutes in a nearly empty restaurant.  Once seat the smell of smoke was still strong even in the dining area so we left without ordering.  If you are a smoker then this is the place for you but if you are not then stay away.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7
Laura P.,"Garland, TX",70,443,1495,1.0,8/8/2017,"We were a party of 12 adults who walked into this Chili's, and after being shown our table, walked out.  Why? Because the restaurant allows SMOKING in the bar, and has no separate ventilation system or barriers to keep the cigarettes smoke from permeating through the whole restaurant.  We have a person our party whose severe asthma is triggered by cigarette smoke. She is fine in restaurants where the smoking area is separated from the nonsmoking areas by walls and a separate ventilation system.  When we asked about the smoke smell, the hostess said the RESTAURANT was non-smoking. What she tried to gloss over (presumably to save the table of 12 diners) was that the BAR in the center of the restaurant allows cigar and cigarette smoking. REALLY? If the smoke drifts unfettered and unfiltered throughout your restaurant, and permeated the ""nonsmoking"" area, I got a news flash for you: it's a SMOKING restaurant.  DUH We are not only never coming back here, we will also avoid all other Chili's which are presumably laid out the same and also allow smoking.  Cheddar's (100% nonsmoking even in their outdoor patio, bar, and parking lot) has earned our business forever.  1 stinky smoky stupid-answer star",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7
Michael Shelly P.,"Sachse, TX",0,6,1,5.0,12/13/2017,Much better than the last few years!! Service is better and food is by far much better!

Ted A.,"Flower Mound, TX",1,143,58,2.0,12/22/2016,"A group of 5 people at 7:30pm on a weeknight. Half the place is empty and we still waited 10-15 minutes to be seated. Once seated it was 5 to 10 minutes before server showed up.  Once ordered it was 15-20 minutes before food arrived. Server was pleasant but think this location's service standards were on the lower end of corporate expectations. Beef nachos, cheese fries, margarita chicken, shrimp tacos, chicken quesadillas and old timer burger ordered. Both nachos and fries must have been sitting under an extremely hot heat lamp for 10 minutes plus as they were super dried out.  Rest of food was passable,  but really for the price you pay the quality is just not there. Chili's used to be a great choice, not so much anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7
Gerardo D.,"Garland, TX",20,26,40,5.0,7/3/2017,"I hadn't ordered from this particular Chili's because my last to-go order wasn't exactly good enough to talk about. But, this time my order was not only on time but everything was delicious. We went with the 2 for $22, I ordered a bacon burger with grilled asparagus on the side and my wife ordered the half rack ribs with green rice on the side and our appetizer was a half order of Texas Cheese Fries. It was all delicious and nothing was left on our plates!  I'll definitely be back for something new!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7
Harry B.,"Murphy, TX",3,33,6,1.0,12/23/2016,As they say in all reviews..... Smell of people smoking is first thing you notice... And you wont get past it if you don't smoke. Garland.. Go figure....  Anyway... Got a to go order and had to use bathroom.  Dirty.... Bad call Chili's.... I only can guess the kitchen gets the same neglect.

Terry S.,"Sachse, TX",78,149,95,2.0,12/23/2016,Well the place was vacant when we got here. I guess I figured out why. Ordered a presidente margarita and it was watered down.

Christina A.,"Dallas, TX",106,2,,1.0,6/4/2017,"The hostess quoted us 20-30 minutes for a party of 6 adults and 3 kids. 30 minutes later and we asked how much later and she said 15 more minutes.

Abraham C.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,,3.0,4/29/2017,Went in after church one Sunday and our server Heather was great. She was very nice and made sure that our drinks were never low. She got everything correct. The only thing I didn't like were the ribs that I ordered. They weren't all that great; very chewy; not at all satisfying. Heather made the experience not the food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7
Paul G.,"Mesquite, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/7/2016,Great!  If you like cigarette smoke and flat beer... Oh! And as an added bonus not all the TVs are functional.  If you get really lucky you can watch one of the working TVs in the reflection of a nearby window (considering you can see the window through ALL the smoke).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7

Eli R.,"Mesquite, TX",262,113,521,1.0,11/22/2015,"I love chilis, but this one was nasty. Soon as you walk through the door you are hit with the nasty cigarette smell coming from the bar..

Louis S.,"Normal, IL",0,5,12,1.0,2/4/2017,"Walked in and the vestibule smelled like stale smoke, opened the doors with my three year old in tow and got punched in the face with smoke.   It's 2017 it should be against Chili's corporate policy to allow smoking inside their restaurants.  Turned around and walked out.  Went to Chili's in Wylie.   They aren't as nuts and out an end to smoking so their non-smoking patrons and employees don't have to suffer from the smokers there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7
Kevin T.,"Garland, TX",0,6,,1.0,3/7/2016,"We haven't eaten at Chilis is a long time. We had a very rare craving (off the healthy diet once a month) for chicken fried chicken with all the typical sides, mashed potatoes, corn and broccoli, and especially big fresh white and wheat rolls! We couldn't believe just how much the menu had changed. For the worst for that matter. But they still serve chicken fried chicken, or should I say a ""wanna be CFC"" for $12 bucks. Way expensive for what you actually get. I was shocked to see this little portion of chicken, and unlike before when they not only had a ""CFC"" that would meet the plates ends, the breading was horrible! Not fluffy and crunchy as they use to make, but looked more like something that was frozen from the grocery store. A frozen Marie Calendars would top this! The mashed potatoes we're probably the best part of the meal if I had to choose, and they weren't even that good. And those rolls we were looking forward to, umm.... No more! Instead a burnt piece of garlic bread now takes its place. The Chilis of yesteryear is long gone. The menu seems to be dominated by all sorts of wraps now. Everything from fried chicken finger wraps to grilled peanut chicken wraps in lettuce. Also cheddar bites (small burgers with huge buns) and all kinds of salads which I can see where some might enjoy. But after our dinner concluded, I called a couple of friends just to see if they've been to Chili's lately (which I should have done prior) and both had the same negative reviews. That all being said, there is still apparently a fairly strong few of die hard Chilis fans due to the restaurant being mostly full while we were there. Major disappointment to see all the menu changes, and more so an absolutely horrible example of what they want to call chicken fried chicken, and no rolls that every restaurant that offers this entrée should at least have as an option.  Stick with Black Eyed Pea or even Luby's for that matter if you're after good old southern style food like Chilis use to offer. Needless to say, we won't be going to Chilis anytime soon, if ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-garland-7
Yongcong Z.,"Austin, TX",2,3,,1.0,12/22/2015,"probably the worst Chili's in the DFW. went there on last Friday night,  waited for nearly 50 minutes with no service, I had to grab a waiter to order the meal, which never happened to me in my entire life. Next, They under-cooked my steak, I had to ask them very politely to redo it. Suggest what, this time they over-cooked it. The steak was so dry and hard as rock! After I paid through whatever little pad seats on the desk, the manager could not wait and took the pad in front of eyes, of course without my consent, and she completed the survey which is the customer rating on the food and service by herself.

There is a little something for everyone! The chips are always so crisp and salsa, just to die for!
