Pat V.,"Hollister, CA",0,6,2,1.0,1/19/2017,"*NOTE: This review is for the GILROY location only** Morgan Hill Cochrane is Awesome This place used to be our go to place for a last minute bite to eat. The last 3-4 times has been HORRIBLE, it has gotten worse and worse with the lack of service as well as the food. Sorry Chili's but after the other night you will never see me again. It wasn't busy when we arrived but waited a long time for anyone to acknowledge we were there. Finally he came; we ordered drinks and bottomless chips and salsa and he said he would come back for our order, he came back with the drinks, took our order but had no chips??? Approximately 15 minutes or more went by and he brought the chips and salsa. No more than 5 minutes went by and he brought my entree (which was wrong) and walked away. Only after five minutes went by I realized he wasn't coming back with my wife's dinner and as I turned to look for this elusive server he appeared. He said to us, before I could say anything, ""Sorry but I completely forgot to put in her order and I'm slammed....would you like some soup? I wanted to make a scene and leave but my wife's look was obvious that she just wanted her dinner, I declined the soup and requested her dinner and to correct my order as well. We did eventually get our order; we finished and asked if there was a check and a manager available, the check came and the manager did not. This was the first time ever, I didn't leave a tip and from a family of restaurateurs I had no problem doing so!  Never again, No thanks, Not worth it Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
SONIA M.,"Hollister, CA",22,2,,1.0,8/13/2017,"Have gone to this place a couple of times and each time I am disappointed. The service is HORRIBLE!!!walked in with my 2 kids for lunch and restaurant was dead, I stood there for about 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were there and nobody did so I walked out. I will no longer spend my money here, what a joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Anthony M.,"Gilroy, CA",19,10,,4.0,3/8/2017,Always heard bad things about here but recently went and they were super nice they accommodated us with a car seat holder. Food was awesome and was done quick,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Brenda B.,"Modesto, CA",50,1,,1.0,2/28/2017,Worse service ever.... waited for the meal for over 45 min it was for a club sandwich... everyone was done w their plate and still hadn't got mine then was told it wasn't going to be given and that sorry for the inconvenience ... should of said that earlier !before everyone was done w their meal,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Tracey P.,"Gilroy, CA",379,246,1161,2.0,3/20/2016,"This place was great for our family. When we arrived we were seated right away. It was early evening so it was still pretty empty. I felt loud since the music playing was so soft it could barely be heard. They had a koalas changing table in the restroom which was nice.   This chili's has a great new feature they added to the tables. A tablet like kiosks to order and pay for drinks, appetizers etc. They call it a ziosk. The best part about them is you can play over 9 different games on it like a tablet with apps. I'm blown away. Each table has one. Since we have two kids they each wanted one so the server grabbed one from another table and didn't hesitate. How kind. The tablet had a pawn like figure attached to it for placement. So you didn't have to hold it to play a game, which was awsome!It was certainly a ploy to keep people's wait time go alot faster. Which worked!!!!! Lol. Neat.   There was a great deal we came here for which wasn't advertised anywhere on the menu which was all you can eat enchiladas. The first plate comes with rice and beans but none there after. The enchiladas were nothing like an enchilada should be. I mean it was basic enchiladas but the texture and taste was awful and all wrong. It was as if there was a napoleon dynamite trying to make enchiladas in a microwave. Horrible. The rice was good but the beans were tasteless. The soda was even a bit off. Like it was watered-down. Ugh.   For us the service was four star but the food was one. I might give it another run. Try another dish. I'll be yelping it guaranteed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Kelly L.,"Parkmerced, San Francisco, CA",464,15,20,1.0,3/25/2017,"Service here is horrible. We order a few drinks and they ended up making it incorrectly twice. They finally brought out the drink and made it too strong. Our server, Jessica, asked how everything was and we told her that our drink was too strong. We presumed that she would offer another drink but she said, ""that's how we they make them."" I'm sorry but that shouldn't be the excuse. Took them about 30-45 minutes to bring out our beverages. Normally the service is quick. Servers would check up on their tables every 30 minutes. It's been about 3 years since I've been down here in Gilroy to see my friends. I order an entree but was never asked what type of side I preferred and they assumed that I wanted fries. I wish the service was a lot better and the same how it was 3-4 years ago. Another server came to check up on us and offered to remake the drinks but at that point we didn't want to risk drinking and driving by the end of the meal. I wish we had gotten his name. He is really on top of everything here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Anabel M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",14,10,,1.0,6/10/2017,"Went for a quick bite but was disappointed with our food service was good. My salad was soggy with dressing not fresh tasting my friends chicken fajita lacked flavor was bland it seemed as though food was prepped early in the morning since was either dry , soggy or bland tasted as if sitting in fridge for days. This place is to be good hard to find a good place for dinner",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Marka S.,"Gilroy, CA",0,12,2,1.0,12/4/2016,Waited an hour for food and order was wrong.  Chips were greasy.  Bad service and did not check on us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Liz L.,"Fresno, CA",0,58,,1.0,8/18/2016,"We initially sat at the bar but after ten minutes of no acknowledgment (the bartender passed us three times) we decided to try the dining area, the host told us that service would be ""faster"" if we sat there bc there are ""two servers"". Ummmmm no. First off Chili's has very little vegetarian options, I can let that go, BUT I can't let go that the service was slower than a hungover snail. I gave the 1 star bc Natalia our server was sweet, and kept a smile but I feel like the manager who had her and another waitress scheduled for lunch hour rush failed her. She forgot my brother's drink & my husband's dessert that was part of his $10 meal deal. We got so tired of waiting we didn't even have the energy to ask for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Jeff B.,"Grand Terrace, CA",5,27,23,2.0,9/3/2016,The food was good. The service was not. Well we never did see our waiter again. We had to waive down someone for everything we needed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Joe C.,"Gilroy, CA",2,40,19,1.0,6/6/2016,Been waiting for 30 min for my tortillas that were supposed to come with fajitas and all the condiments for my dinner at this time my food has gone cold and my bread on my burger is hard and stale!

RO T.,"Gilroy, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/9/2016,"last night my son wants to celebrate my husbands (his dad) birthday and decided to go to chilis in Gilroy, we were there & waiting for our orders for more than 1 hr.  So we decided to cancel the order.  They told us they have a party, we understand that. The reason why we decided to leave was late customers got their orders and my son was pointing those customers thats already eating and we're still waiting for the orders!!! Poor service. BAD EXPERIENCE. Going Chilis in Gilroy to celebrate important event? Dont go,  Not worth it.   We ended up eating  Pho LOL!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Lorianne V.,"San Jose, CA",48,27,7,1.0,7/2/2015,This is the worst Chili's restaurant ever. The concrete outside the front door looks like someone drug a dead body around and tried to clean it up with the fryer oil... Every time we've been here they screw up everything and the food sucks anyways. They cleaned a table for us when we got there I slid into a slimy wet booth with shorts on.. Horrifying. My burger was so greasy and grey colored I couldn't even stomach it.  I took a piece out for my dog and even he questioned its integrity. Just nasty...  Human disapproval... Dog disapproval...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Mike J.,"Houston, TX",4,35,292,4.0,9/17/2014,"I come here fairly often. The staff is usually friendly.  Of course, fully stocked bar. Can't beat it.  Eight big screen TVs. Always has all the games on. If not request a channel. They will change it for you.   Lots of seating in dining area as well as the bar area.  Bathrooms usually stocked and clean. Restaurant is also usually clean.  You know the menu by now I'm sure. Ribs. Chili. Fajitas. Pretty good for a chain.  Seems to always have new staff.  No wifi.  No adjacent wifi. BYOI (bring your own Internet) LOL Use your tables ZIOSK to reorder drinks!!  Pretty cool!  I will be back. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Lorri B.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,10,,5.0,8/28/2016,We just left there and I have to say it was really good! The waitress was a sweet heart and super good!! I wish I could remember her name (she had dark long hair in a pony tail) to give her a shout out. I would absolutely recommend going here. I was a little skeptical after reading the reviews but glad we decided to go anyways cause it was great !!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Stacy G.,"San Mateo, CA",86,32,,2.0,1/15/2016,"This was the worst Chili's I have ever been to!! The customer service is not the best, I ordered a salad and a turkey burger. It's pretty hard to mess up a "" house salad"".. The lettuce was old the carrots were no good.. The turkey burger was over cooked. I've had better food at Jack-in-the-Box!! I asked for dessert, they told me that they were out of the desert I wanted??!! I got the check it was Way too much money$$!! Lousy food, poor customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Eric V.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,85,121,4.0,10/13/2014,"Exceptional service Jared and Sarah were amazing. Customer service runs in their blood. Always good to have great service when you are traveling, keeps you smiling on the road.  Had the guacamole turkey burger with seasoned dill pickles. It was tasty and savory. Good to the last bite. You can choose your patty, but was recommended that I have with turkey. Do yourself a favor have the turkey.  Chips and salsa were fresh.  Get on chili's email club and you get coupons for free appetizers and chips and salsa. We had the free chips and salsa!

Dominique M.,"Hollister, CA",0,18,3,1.0,6/18/2016,"I usually don't leave reviews or complain but on this one I had to...  Service:  - took about 15 mins for them to FINALLY ask us what we wanted to drink.  - took about 15 MORE mins for them to take our order. -appetizer took a about 20 mins to come.  -35 mins later, I asked the lady in the front how long it takes because the people behind us had a party of 6, had their food & were almost done eating.  Food: -got a toasted turkey sandwich, for $9 I would expect it to be decent, (I was wrong...) it was gross, drowned in mayo & some pieces of lettuce looked old.  Overall, I would NOT recommend this to anyone.. A complete waste of money. The only upside was I talked to the manager & he gave me a refund on the $9 sandwich that I got.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Paolo B.,"Pebble Beach, CA",8,248,93,1.0,4/5/2015,"After our 12/26/14 experience, we were offered some Chili's coupons by their corporate office.  We should have given them away as a birthday gift or a tip to the paperboy! We arrived on a Friday evening to find the dining room 1/2 full.  We still had to wait 20 minutes for a table.... here we go again! The tables are not cleaned with cleanser - just a slimey rag from the busboys pocket.  We watched the rag used to wipe chairs, tables and highchairs.  Baby barf wiped on the table - YUMMY! No warnings about the ZOOSK tablets on the tables.  There is a 99¢ charge if you play with it - but there are not warning stickers on the table, back of the tablet, in the menu, signs on the table, warnings in the lobby... a big scam, so beware! Our appetizer arrived promptly, but the entree order took forever to arrive, and in their usual fashion, it was all screwed up.  The entrees were cold.  Vegetables were undercooked - basically raw. I'm not complaining to anyone this time - I'm just NEVER going back TO ANY CHILI'S. They are not like the 1980's Chili's that we grew up with... bottomless french fries, handmade burgers, and ""honest"" tacos. It's worse than the diner at a Tijuana truck stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Ashley L.,"San Martin, CA",0,6,,2.0,7/26/2016,I've always been a fan of Chili's. Their drinks are good and most of the servers are great. I'm not a fan of the fact that they keep changing the serving dishes or menu. I'm a taco lover but all of the new ones are waaaayyy too soggy. It's impossible to eat like a taco and they serve it on such a tiny plate that juice gets absolutely everywhere. Feel like theyre trying too hard to be modern. I do like that they always have some sort of deal or special going on though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=20
Marcio E.,"Gilroy, CA",10,29,1,5.0,7/14/2017,Great food. I always try to get the same waiter is one of the few people that you can tell he likes his job or he try hard to make you feel comfortable.

Allison F.,"San Jose, CA",1,41,14,1.0,9/21/2017,"Why aren't negative stars a thing?!? definitely don't come here if you're either super hungry or in any type of a rush; ensure you can wait a long while before eating!! suuuuuuch slow hostesses, waiters, kitchen staff, bar tenders, bus-boys....  still here waiting for my husbands burger, as a matter of fact.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy
Steven M.,"Turlock, CA",154,23,61,4.0,10/5/2017,So not even reading any of the previous yelps and saw that this chili's has a 2 star rating and I can see why after my visit. It's not that anything was horrid I had am Oktoberfest and a bowl of enchilada soup but really $13 seems a tad bit high but non the less that's not the resson for the 2 star. Managers need to make their team understand they are always on stage and not to be so timid and impersonal. Like I said I got my beer and soup quick but if you want anything  else you're shit out of luck with this crew. I hate giving bad star ratings so the 4 stars are for the soup quality and beer coldness Remember you're in the hospitality businesses chili's,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy

Alexandria B.,"San Jose, CA",60,3,,1.0,11/19/2017,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!! Our waiter Bianca hardly came back to our table to check on us. Took her more than 10 minutes to bring us back our refills on our drink. Walked passed us several times and noticed that we finished our appetizer and still left them on our table. The guy who brought us our food finally took them away. I had to ask the manager in the grey shirt to bring us napkins and steak sauce. On top of that my Asparagus were over cooked and DRY!! I have been going to this chili's since I moved here and now that I've experienced this I will reconsider about coming here again. I would rather drive the 30 minutes to San Jose to find a better chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy
Cathy F.,"Hollister, CA",4,4,,5.0,9/27/2017,Excellent food and service! Prices are reasonable and with a coupon from the Plenti/Chili's app a couple could eat a nice meal with soda and lemonade for under $20.  Menu includes a 2 for $22 daily special....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy
Erika I.,"Gilroy, CA",0,6,1,2.0,6/12/2017,"I eat at the Gilroy Chillis a few times a month with my boyfriend and we always sit at or near the bar. The usual bartender we see, I think his name is David and he has a bunch of random tattoos down his arms, is very nice and good at what he does. However, the last couple times we were there we had a different bartender. He has platinum blonde spiked hair. He's very forgetful and in his own little world. I was sitting at the bar and would ask him for something very simple and my boyfriend and I would watch as he would slowly forget and become distracted by something else. It became a game between us to see how long he would take to get our check.  The manager on duty, Angel I think his name is. Every time I see him he's walking around like a relative of his just died. He looks extremely depressed and lost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy

Monique A.,"Gilroy, CA",1,17,6,2.0,4/13/2017,"Food is mediocre.. Our server was great, he was a young man, kinda quiet but still took care of us. My one problem that bugged me soo much, was this server that had a attitude about the simplest thing, like me asking for napkins (had to ask twice btw) . She has black framed glasses, Latina I'm assuming. Didn't catch her name..probably should of asked the manager. But decided I'd just vent on here, so everyone could see it.  I've been a server before and the attitude she had was uneccasary and makes people, like me, not want to come back and spend money. If you can't handle the heat stay out the kitchen chick.  Time we went was 1ish maybe like 1:30ish... To management, maybe check the schedule and see what girl server with black glasses was working... And give her a coaching.. Or write up for being disrespectful. Please and thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy

I went to get a to-go they got my order wrong, I asked for the chicken well done and all these other special items are normally ask for was not correct like I thought because of the poor service I had on the phone when I began the to-go order. There was a Bartender in the name Seth, he is horrible. He forgets about you, you ask something and he says he will get it for you and he helps other people and you constantly keep to ask someone else because he is very careless. All I wanted was my drink lol and he just continues taking orders, etc, everything else besides making my simple lemonade. Horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy
Nicole A.,"Gilroy, CA",1,26,21,1.0,9/2/2017,I dont know why this location is still open. 2nd time here and I was served cold food and under cooked shrimp.

Shruti R.,"Fremont, CA",137,119,357,2.0,4/25/2016,"Ah. In one line, really bad service and the food isn't even worth it.  Drinks ------- ~The Arnold Palmers both mango and strawberry were very bad. They were so diluted that water tasted better.  ~The Tito's punch cocktail was pretty great and made up for the mundane Arnold Palmers. Food  ----- ~They serve complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was tangy and good for an appetizer. ~The nachos we ordered were already very cold when served.  ~The vegetarian fajita was an utter disappointment. I would call it broccoli salad. ~ The enchiladas were okay thanks to all the cheese. Overall, the food lacked flavour. Service  ------- If not for the lousy service, I might have given a three stars.

I made eye contact with the bartender but to no avail. Finally someone came to sit us. One of the biggest quips is our son always orders the same thing and they always tend to get it wrong. This time the service was terrible. I ordered a strawberry lemonade and our waiter brought me a really watered down one. I asked if he can bring me another one and when he did he put it on the table and said ""is this better??"" With an attitude. Then the restaurant wasn't even that busy and took 30 minutes to get our order while the people who came after us got their food first. Never again. No thanks.

I also had a mango Arnold Palmer which was really refreshing.  The other member of my party had a Cajun pasta and coffee. The waiter offer A refill for coffee but we said not yet.

But about 45 minutes later after we finished our starters we had finally got main course..  Mind you our food was cold. Sent it back and still came back cold. Even the broccoli that's supposed to be steamed seemed like it went from the delivery truck to the plate. We had fajitas that weren't even sizzling. Had cold mango-chile chicken. Had one pasta lost in transit. And another pasta that was just frozen cold. Where you knew automatically that it's been sitting.  Mind you the general manager came out to speak to us. After we had to ask after 4 times of the food getting sent back. And she was even rude. Didn't come out professional at all. There's no communication through their servers and the kitchen staff.

We never had to ask for a refill he kept up with us.  My 4yr old son was excited he was able to play games while we waited. The little Kiosk on each table is a great idea.

Amanda Z.,"Everett, WA",38,47,11,1.0,1/1/2014,"Had the worst service I've EVER had from any restaurant ever tonight at Chili's. We were seated immediately and then forgotten about for 15 minutes when no one at all came by to take our drink orders. After 15 minutes of being ignored by all the servers walking by helping other tables, we finally flagged down a waitress who said she'd get our server. Then she came back to say she'd be our server. She took our drink and food orders. The drinks came quickly after, but we waited over a half an hour to get our food. At this point, we'd been there nearly an hour without food.  Meanwhile, a couple came and was seated after us, ordered and received their appetizers before we even got our drinks. Their entrees came before ours as well, and we didn't even order appetizers! An hour into this miserable dining experience, our waitress was nowhere to be found and neither was our food, so we had to flag down ANOTHER server to ask him to get us the manager. The manager, who paced around the restaurant like he was lost, did not apologize for the appallingly bad service, just said he'd check on our ticket. He shuffled back to the kitchen, and we never saw him again that night.  We eventually got our food, but the orders were incomplete. Two of the meals were served without french fries (which showed up 10 minutes after the food was delivered), the ribs were served without bbq sauce, and the chicken was hopelessly overcooked. The waitress showed up again to give us the bill. She did not apologize for any of the blunders that night, or explain the poor service (if the kitchen was having issues, etc) just handed me the check. One of our meals had been comped, but the entire meal was such a disaster, that I don't think comping the entire meal would entice me to go back there.

Zippity D.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,57,16,1.0,6/2/2014,"The Gilroy Chili's is probably the biggest smelly armpit of all Chili's in the chain.  If yelp had negative stars, my one star rating would equate to 1 bazillion negative stars. There was so much wrong with our visit to this stain of a feed hole, let me just highlight the a few top line items that any restaurant should be acutely aware of: #1.  When every empty table (and most were empty), has dirty dishes, food all over floor, spills between tables and what looked like some kids vomit in a booth, well, you really should be busy cleaning it up as to not repulse new diners walking in the door hungry wanting to spend money there. Note to yourself: if the place looks really bad and dirty when you walk in the door, don't eat there! If you have to practically beg to just get your table re-cleaned because its sticky filthy dirty, maybe it's time to walk out instead and go somewhere else. This is advice I should have followed.  #2. People ask for water because they are thirsty. If you serve them dirty water glasses with Food floating in the water and dirty glasses with food stains all over them, that's not good. It's so not good, it's disgusting and downright vile that a restaurant thinks that's even OK. On days like this, I wish for 1 day I was a county health inspector. If so, this place would be red tagged closed in 2 minutes. #3. Ignoring your guests because the big joke in the kitchen is Julio's love tryst with Juan is all the rage ain't cool to those wanting to order food and eat. Great that you like to have fun at work. Try to remember the reason you have ""work"" is because people with money come there to be eat food and get some sliver of service from you. If you think it's more important to brag about your boyfriends new tat or belly piercing, then maybe you should work in hair salon instead. #4. Automated mini ordering kiosks at the table Chili's, really? Lame.  Wait staff telling you to use a machine that doesn't work to get a check and pay? Lamer. Whole IDE of machines serving your customer? Lamest idea ever. As said earlier, there was so much wrong with our visit to Chili's in Gilroy that I just highlighted some of the big things. The food quality was pretty bad as well, cold fries with our burgers, meat under cooked, vomit 3 booths away from us..... Did I mention the vomit 3 booths away from us?  A very long time ago, early 1980s, Chili's used to be a fun, clean place for Lunch or a Family outing.  How times have changed. They have turned it into an over priced experiment in public health disasters on the same level of the great plague, Chernobyl and a county hospital filled with oozing goo all rolled into one serving of sugary water and poison beef or chicken niblets to the masses. Awesome job Chili's Gilroy!! If you can avoid this Chili's at all costs, you may be saving yourself from some epic disappointment. Lets also throw in the major stomach problems we all had the day after eating there. Yeah, good times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=40

We ordered our food and disappointment set in.  I am allergic to dairy and my burger had cheese although I had requested none and informed the server of my allergy. My wife complained that the egg rolls were super soggy, but she is too nice to send them back and told me she would just deal with it.  My son loved his pretzels but it's not super hard to please a toddler with food.  I had to ask 4 times for cheese sauce for them though since that is the only way he will eat anything... dipped in sauce.   Believe it or not, the food was the GOOD part of our experience.  The place is filthy.  The server wiped down our table for us since we got there as the other couple was leaving. There was food on one of the chairs so she wiped that too.  It was a high table that wouldn't accommodate a high chair so when my wife spotted a table across the bar that was low, we asked if we could take that one instead.  The server used the SAME towel to wipe down that table... not rinsing or using any kind of cleaning agent. No thanks, I don't want some guys butt touching my table please since you just wiped a chair with that towel.  I think the health department needs to check this place out. Thank goodness my wife is a germiphobe and carries lysol wipes in the toddlers diaper bag.  She wiped down the table because there was no way my kid was eating off of that.   Also witnessed one male server towel whip another male server's butt.

If you're going to Chilis things will most likely be consistent and that's certainly true here. You know what you're going to get and because of that I have no problem going here if that's what I'm in the mood for.  Yes it is a chain and I can't knock a chain because their food tastes like chain food, their staff is good and if I'm in the mood for some chain grub at a reasonable price I would come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=80

The only thing hot was the fajitas. The rest of our food was barely warm. Its late, and i just wanted our food. My chicken was fine, but my fries were hardly warm. I love fries & I am picky about them and usually you can't go wrong with fries!....so I told the waitress they were not very warm.

Scott B.,"Aromas, CA",1,50,1,2.0,8/23/2014,"2 stars because the server was good. That's it.  We walked in to a seemingly empty dinning area around 1:30 pm on a Friday and we had to wait for a table. Why? I'm looking around not seeing many people.  When we finally were seated, the host gave us 2 names of who might be serving. Again. Why wait 5 minutes when 2 servers for 1 table?  And then told us about that stupid ziosk. Not only is that thing a disconnect from your server, it changes screens as a distraction to try to take your attention from the people in your group. Top it off it has games for 99 cents? What has this world come to where parents can't deal with their kids during a meal and spoils them even more or ignores them by playing games? I can't only imaging how dirty those ziosk screens are.  The server was nice and prompt. But didn't ask how we like our burgers cooked. Maybe we didn't have a choice?  The speed, quality and quantity of the food was bad.  Took over 30 minutes for 2 burgers and a chicken sandwich.  I did mention it wasn't full of customers.  Our server did come by to apologize for the slow speed. I think she knew what the real problem was but didn't tell us. (The chef is slow) My food arrived some what warm. The burger was advertised to have 4 strips of bacon. It barely had 2. Looking at the cheese, it was sitting around for a while. I had about 10 French fries. Same burger status as my other guest. The chicken sandwich was reported to be good coming from a non-complainer. I ate it because I was so hungry. I'm not a breakfast eater and it was close to 2:15 by the time we were served.  Overall we have always had good luck with all the other Chili's restaurants.  Not this one.  What I don't understand is, why the owner or manager of this one doesn't do anything about the low rating. Clearly I'm not the only one with this feedback.  We'll guess what? We won't be back and you won't get any of my hard worked American money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=80

Prior to this visit.   The food was in poor condition.  First we ordered Chips, salsa, side salad and drinks all were in eating condition  As for our main course we ordered which was lacking regarding the preparation for he food.  1st order was Lighter Choice Salmon (cal. 540 Lightly seasoned seared Atlantic salmon. Served with rice & steamed broccoli. We received: a small piece of salmon and double broccoli (which was not order), the broccoli was room temperature and had about 30 grains of rice.  See picture below.   2nd order was Classic Ribeye 100% USDA thick-cut steak marbled for maximum flavor & topped with garlic butter. Served with loaded mashed potatoes & steamed broccoli. We received: a small piece of Classic Sirloin - 6 oz 3rd order:  Make it a combo: Half Rack Of Ribs and chicken Served with mashed potatoes and a corn on the cob. We received: Cold ribs, cold BBQ sauce, mashed potatoes and broccoli 4th plate:Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich Crispy chicken with our spicy Buffalo sauce, fresh sliced tomato, lettuce & house-made ranch. We received: This was the only meal served in acceptable condition.  However the waiter at our table was great our food was awful!  Upon speaking with the GM, Amber Shigihara  she offered excuses for the poor food services stating they were busy and she was in the back cooking as well.  We expressed that we didn't want excuses and that the food was not in serving condition and the GMs reply was ""Im not trying to give excuses but give explanations"" which was unacceptable.   We were disappointed in the food service and the GM's reply that we returned our meals and paid for the drink and  one plate out of the 4 plates ordered  that was acceptable to eating order and left.  We as a family make visits to Chilis about 4 to 5 times a month and this was our first unacceptable meal service.  We will not be visiting the Chili's in Gilroy again!    Melissa Corral",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=80

Both my husband's chicken crispers and my quesadilla were soggy having sat to sweat. After asking them to remove my entree and replace my husband's which had a hair in addition to being mushy, came out under cooked TWICE, the items that were supposed to be removed from our bill were not, instead it was initially ""creatively adjusted"" so that we were still billed for at least half, before it was ultimately corrected.

What's worse is when you flip back and forth through their menu only hoping to find SOMETHING you'd SETTLE FOR to eat. I can settle for a job. I can settle for a relationship. But for some reason, I can't settle when it comes to food. Damn, that's the one thing that peeves me about Chili's. They have a little bit of everything, but nothing that I actually want to eat. Alright, ranting done. Service has been good every time someone has dragged me here. Their current music is surprisingly good. It's a smattering of not over-played, but yet familiar pop songs from the past 15 years or so. That part is relatively standard. What's awesome, though, is that every now and then, I'll hear songs from the likes of Vampire Weekend, The Decemberists, and Spoon.

Kristen H.,"Gilroy, CA",9,5,,1.0,11/15/2013,"Worst service ever here. We came for a quick dinner. Server acted like she was doing us a favor by her doing her job. The  Kids menu said $4.59 on it but when we got the check it said $4.99. It's only 40cents but we still asked. Instead of them just automatically changing it to what the menu said the manager comes out and says sorry about that I will ""discount"" that for you but we ran out of our kids menu and printed out menus from online so it's suppose be 4.99. We told her it wasn't about 40cents it was the fact that it didn't match what was shown on the menu to us. She continued to make it seem like she was giving us a ""discount"" instead of just honoring what the menu said! Ridiculous! We have only been here a few time and each time the service is horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=100

Victoria K.,"Gilroy, CA",3,17,3,1.0,1/19/2016,"This is the worst Chili's ever!  Don't stop here.  But if you do, don't expect good service.  And don't expect that you will have hot food in a timely manner.  We have tried this location several times since we moved to the area.  Each time, we are hopeful that the service/management/cooks have improved.  But we just kid ourselves.  Our last visit was the final time we will ever eat at this location.  In fact, the experience was so bad, it has tainted all Chili's restaurants for me.  We were there on a Friday night with kids.  We were seated within 10 minutes of walking in, which isn't bad.  They told us their computer system was down and that orders were being backed up.  I told them I appreciated the information and thought, ""It can't be that bad.""  Boy, was I wrong!  We ordered within 15 minutes of being seated.  After that was when everything started to go downhill.  The waitress did not inform us that our drink orders were also backed up so we couldn't even get water until half an hour in.  Then I had to remind our waitress about the kid's drinks that we also ordered.  It took about 45 minutes to get the order of Texas cheese fries as our appetizer.  I should have taken a picture to show you how ridiculously small the serving was.  I have ordered this appetizer before and I know how loaded they can be.  After an hour and 45 minutes, our food had still not arrived.  No one came by to ask if we wanted more drinks or just to check in.  The staff looked frazzled and just kept pacing around the kitchen area.  I started to look around at the other tables and noticed that other customers were walking out or getting really irritated.  I finally got a manager over and asked her what the issue was.  She said that their computer system was down and that they were backed up by 20 orders.  She didn't bother apologizing for the wait or explaining how much longer our order would take....all because the system was down.  I was shocked....how is a broken computer system delaying the kitchen by 2 hours??  Since our food was no where near being served, we left.  I hope that this location gets their act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gilroy?start=100

I've mostly sat at the bar but when sitting at a table didn't have to wait long. When I order drinks they are really good, I get the food quickly & it's hot.

I was charged for 2 steaks, couldn't find our waiter again so flagged down the hostess who went and found him to correct the error. Water glasses never refilled, coffee never refilled. Bathroom was filthy and you have walk by the kitchen on your way back to the table.

The service and atmosphere is great at this chain restaurant. The food is what gets to me. When I was young and my taste buds were different, I use to love Chili's. Being 30 something, I have had the opportunity to try so many other great restaurants. Sorry Chili's, no offense, but your food is too salty and has way to many calories. I understand the atmosphere and service is awesome, but the food drives me away. It's not your fault, it's my taste buds.

We sent them back and continued to wait for our lunch which never came. At this point we were angry and just wanted to leave. Talked to a manager which assured us she would pack up are lunch to go and not charge us for anything but after 10 mins we walked out the door. I would never go back to this Chili's again.

She began to tell me the manger said he was worried about getting food out to the guest already there.  And it was his decision to have no other customers be seated?  I was shocked, I even asked if I could just sit and have drinks until the ""RUSH"" was over, and she said NO.. I was looking for a hidden camera!

Dani T.,"Salinas, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/1/2013,"My parents and I went to this Chili's for lunch on a slow afternoon. My father had been craving their sliders that came with their appetizer sampler, so he had ordered that as his meal. I had ordered a sirloin and my mother ordered a salad. When we did eventually get our food, because the wait was quite long especially for a very slow afternoon,  not only was my steak cold all around, they had brought my father a cold hamburger cut into quarters instead of sliders. When my father said something, because the waitress didn't mention anything, she claimed they were out of sliders. She never came out to ask him if he would like to order something else, and she didn't even say anything when setting it down, like she was hoping we wouldn't notice.  The whole reason we had gone to Chili's was because my father wanted their sliders.

After about twenty minutes we received our Wings and appetizer together that we had ordered from the $20 dollar for two menu. The wings came out burnt and our server was like wow, looks like both came up at the same time. Same time twenty minutes later. Then I had ordered the Chicken Fajitas and my lady order the quesadilla. Well they brought out her food and forgot to bring out the extra guac she ordered. Then on my dish it was not sizzling at all and my vegetables on my plate were really cold. I mean they didn't even heat it up. I can understand at least one mistake, but for our entire experience.
