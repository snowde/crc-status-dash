Tony T.,"West Hartford, CT",0,21,60,5.0,9/28/2017,Had Caitlin D as our server tonight and she was the best! Attentive and fast! Best we've had in a long time! Thank you Caitlin! And the food was good! Cajun chicken pasta and Steak never fail!  Updated review: went to Chilis tonight and sat in the bar. Ashley was amazing! So quick and friendly! Enjoyed our night. We'll never visit a different chilis again- this ones the best.   Yet another update: I can't help but rave about this chili's location every time I order from it! Had curbside pickup tonight and the girl was outside within seconds of pulling up. Food fresh and hot! Super friendly woman wish I got her name but must've been training because it looked like a manager came out to check as she was reading our order back to us. Thanks chili's for always satisfying my cravings!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Noah B.,"Vernon, CT",38,95,86,2.0,2/21/2017,"What do you do when a restaurant doesn't serve the same food that it says it's going to serve if you read the menu? I had this predicament tonight when I ate at Chili's. I ordered chicken nachos that we're supposed to come with sour cream cheese jalapeno peppers and black beans. When I bit into them I realized there were no black beans they were using refried beans. I don't eat refried beans because they're cooked with bacon or pork. I alerted the waitress to this problem. She sent over the manager. The manager proceeded to tell me that he didn't know why the menu said it was black beans when they always use a bean paste. That is not an acceptable thing for a restaurant to do. If a food is listed on the menu as being served a certain way it should be served the way it's supposed to be served. It's one thing if I ask him to make a change but it's another thing if they change it without permission. The other people with me ordered fajitas, which were OK.  The manager took my nachos off the bill, but didn't offer any other apologies. Excuses are not apologies. This mistake will happen again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Babak A.,"Glastonbury, CT",43,248,124,2.0,11/10/2017,"sad to say that the chili's i knew from my teenage years is completely dead! I remember the nachos used to be piled high and tasted great, now it looks like 10 pieces of chips with stuff on it ! joke!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Matt J.,"South Windsor, CT",265,216,71,4.0,2/14/2017,"Chili's is very consistent, regardless of where you go. For me, that's a positive as I'm looking for consistent food for a reasonable price. What tends to be variable is service. This Chili's does well with service. I go to Chili's when I want a burger or a quesadilla at a good price. I like the kids to get something affordable and I can get it here. Chili's is a good deal for the family with consistent food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
David S.,"Colchester, CT",1,16,,3.0,9/9/2017,"I've been to most every Mexican restaurant (both chain and local) around Hartford.  This is my go-to place for fajitas.  Always comes out sizzling on a cast-iron skillet with meat and vegetables that are char-broiled (slightly blackened...brings out the flavor), slightly crisp and very tasty.  NO mushy vegetables from covered-pan cooking here!  Most of their other menu items I have had are a little sodium-laden for my taste buds.  My father did enjoy their salmon and rib combo platter, however.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Tami C.,"Glastonbury, CT",2162,144,4448,3.0,1/18/2016,"It's chili's, you know the drill. It's exactly what you'd expect delivered in the usual way. Mediocre cookie cutter food, plastic looking everything. Dirty seats, same old booths. We're not fans in particular, but were pressed for time. We came to finally use a years old gift card. On an up note, the drinks were surprisingly good and inexpensive. If for some unknown reason even with all the other choices around you find yourself at chili's, definitely go for a drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Michael W.,"Colchester, CT",0,4,1,1.0,2/4/2017,"Place is extremely cold, heat only works when you walk in. Your food will take for ever and hopefully it's hot! Cleanliness is horrible, food all over the floors. Won't be back....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Mary S.,"Green Cove Springs, FL",0,3,,3.0,7/13/2016,"I am visiting here and have eaten at this Chilis twice now. The food is tasty and the wait staff very friendly. However, be prepared to wait an hour or so for your food. There has not been enough staff and you may need to wait for a table when half of the tables are empty. Frustrating for all.

Audra S.,"Colchester, CT",112,22,,5.0,12/11/2016,"Sunday's at Chili's is the best, half price drinks and appetizers. Comfort food and yummy drinks. Don't forget the chips and salsa!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Tammy G.,"Glastonbury, CT",9,79,38,1.0,12/17/2015,"We used to enjoy going to this Chilli's, but each time we go, it gets worse.   The atmosphere is fine, typical.  The food quality, in my opinion has gone down.  I ordered the fish tacos, which were cold, and had an ""off"" flavor which made me nervous that I may get sick if I finished the meal.  I didn't want to complain because I had already expressed my dissatisfaction with our drinks.  The glasses were about 80% ice, 20% liquid.   We ordered another round and asked for less ice, the drinks were served to us in a glass only half full. ( ""less ice doesn't mean more drink"" )  I found that super cheap and pathetic.   If your in Glastonbury, there are many other restaurants you should try before settling for Chilli's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
April M.,"South Glastonbury, CT",0,6,1,2.0,11/13/2016,"What food we got was good, but cold, had to go back for 1 out of 5 orders despite having them read the order back to us. Not a good take out experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Stephanie U.,"East Haddam, CT",0,20,,1.0,11/1/2016,"first off when we're waiting to be seated to be seated with children during lunch when no one else is there don't assume I want to sit in the bar with my kids , I don't think so. the food was disgusting we ordered burritos and enchiladas, completely nasty . taco bell is 100% than what we got. I will never go back to this one the whole experience was gross and disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Robert S.,"Glastonbury, CT",14,7,,2.0,5/2/2016,"Wow did that suck! The service was at best, slow and at worst willfuly innatentive.  4 orders: a salad, a grilled cheese, half rack of baby back ribs and a burrito...an hour later, nothing, fifteen minutes after that, I asked the host about our order. Poof the food appeared...cold, congealed,  and dry, respectively.  2 stars because...its chili's, not fine dining...McDonald's is the 1 star baseline upon which this review is based. Wow did that suck but, it was Chili's,  Chili's at its worst?...AVOID the Glastonbury location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Em T.,"East Hartford, CT",285,26,5,1.0,6/13/2016,"We entered the location and there was a line. Apparently no one had approached them for 15 minutes or even more. So we went to go find a waitress. There was two waitresses, a tall blonde girl and a short dark haired lady that I had approached. I told them that there were people waiting as well as us and no one has came to approach them or us. The short dark haired lady immediately tried to shut me up and told me that she ""knows and that there is a wait so we'll get to you when there isn't one"". So I brought up the common courtesy of telling the guests waiting up at the front the situation rather then completely ignoring them? The short lady still shut me down and said, ""there's a wait"" with a mean, rude tone. The taller blonde hair girl seemed extremely overwhelmed and apologized and explained that there was a long wait. She later said that she would be there in one minute to seat us. She asked us if we would like to be split or wait to be seated together. She then offered a table in the bar area and said that they would clean it right off to seat us. Instead of cleaning off the tables, their putting all the trash onto the table. We later approached a male that told us that she was busy taking orders at the table so she'll be with us later. The host never told the waitress in our area that there was a party waiting to be seated in her area so we waited an additional 15minutes. If we weren't persistent and told the waitress the situation, we would have never been seated and probably waiting even longer.  There is two graduations in the area. This location was NOT prepared for anything. Half of the location was shut off already. There is no type of communication being done between the waitresses or hostess. This is the MOST UNORGANIZED AND UNPROFESSIONAL visit I have ever had in my life. If our waitress wasn't great, we probably would have walked out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Melissa F.,"Glastonbury, CT",105,307,77,4.0,11/28/2014,"I was pleasantly surprised during my visit to Chili's yesterday. It had been forever since I ate here and decided to stop in. Like at least half the menu is new and it seems like they are trying to have more fresh options, which I like. Started with the southwestern egg rolls which I love. I got the southwest pairing (I think that's what it was called) where you pick 2 or 3 from about 6 different options and they all come with rice and beans. I got the sour cream chicken enchilada and the chicken soft taco. They were perfectly sized and not too much food even though I was hungry. Very flavorful and tasty. I even ate the beans and I usually hate black beans. Props to Chili's for stepping up their game. Waitress was friendly and attentive even though she was busy. The tablets at the tables made for a fast and convenient checkout when we wanted to pay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Jeff C.,"Shelton, CT",15,19,10,4.0,12/5/2015,Service and food at this location is always outstanding. It can be a bit loud at time as there are a lot of families in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Erica G.,"South Glastonbury, CT",17,9,5,1.0,3/24/2016,"Worst meal ever. Never going back. We called ahead, thankfully because they were quoting 45 minute wait. 50% of the tables were empty. They must have been short staffed. Our waitress brought our drinks promptly but didn't come back for 15 minutes to take our order. When the food came the quantities were small and the food was undercooked and it was so highly seasoned you couldn't taste anything but the seasoning. I have no plans to go back there. Ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Dawn O.,"East Hartford, CT",231,233,630,4.0,7/24/2015,Guess I got lucky after reading the other reviews.  My waitress was very patient and friendly.  I ordered the Blackberry Iced Tea and said I didn't want it too sweet so she brought it out with a shot of the blackberry syrup on the side so I could adjust it to my liking.  We ordered the new White Queso as an appetizer.  And she immediately brought out the chips so we could nibble on them while we waited for the Queso to come out.  I liked the new Queso it's much lighter than the original Queso and it has spinach (no meat either).  I went with the Bacon Cheeseburger cooked perfectly and just a good as I remembered  (been a while since I have been to Chili's )  My friend did the lunch special which you choose a starter and she had a small garden salad with blue cheese dressing....she loves her blue cheese.  And for her meal it was a half of a BLT on a pretzel roll.  It looked really good and had a good amount of bacon.  She enjoyed it. Our waitress was great and I'd go back....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury
Veronika W.,"South Glastonbury, CT",102,7,3,1.0,3/20/2016,"Absolutely horrible service when I went there on Thursday two weeks ago. The waitress did not even ask what we wanted for appetizers until 28 minutes after seating. It was not packed, so the service was too slow for a party of 3. The waitress also did not come by to ask if we needed anything else and at that point we ran out of our drinks so we had to eat without any more water/soda. Very disappointed in their service and I will not go back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury

Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",340,1544,221,4.0,1/2/2015,"I've always loved Chili's and it's probably my favorite casual chain restaurant. Sat in the bar here a couple of times and had dinner and always had a good time.

Faith L.,"New York, NY",0,4,1,2.0,8/13/2016,"Half the restaurant was empty and there was a ten minute wait. After the wait we were seated at the many empty tables. The service was slow. 15 minutes for drinks and 30 for appetizers (and of course the food came out five minutes after the apps).

Linda L.,"East Hartford, CT",1,27,34,1.0,6/19/2014,"Shame shame on chili's why would you put a bartender behind the bar who does not have a clue how to make even the simplest drink I understand everyone has to learn, however you should have a trained bartender with the trainee  also 6.50 for a drink that is equivalent to a half shot (raspberry vodka with cranberry juice) if you didn't  take out the ice it might have been a shot I had stopped going to chili's about two years ago because the food and service was soooo bad, has not changed. There are so many other restaurants in Glastonbury do not waste your time or money going to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury?start=20
Simone D.,"Glastonbury, CT",36,46,3,1.0,4/10/2015,I love their salads but the service has steadily gone downhill. They're not even trying any more. Captive audience? Not I.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury?start=20
Jeff P.,"Colchester, CT",5,39,2,2.0,1/11/2016,We use to go to this chilis all the time. Went on a Sunday at 6pm. Server was nice and accommodating even though they were way under staffed. Had to order appetizers twice then never showed. Wanted to bring it after the main course came. No thank you. Main course had brown avocados on top of tacos. Too much time under heat lamp.  Tacos weren't even room temp. What a shame. No more chain restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury?start=20
Shellene O.,"Hebron, CT",79,245,44,3.0,4/29/2013,"I hadn't been to a Chili's in quite some time and just recently I've been to this one in Glastonbury twice.   An interesting thing that they've got now are these kiosk's at each table.  These kiosks have one utterly useless (IMHO) feature:  game play (completely defeats the point of dining together, don't we have enough distractions with our phones?).  However I think two of the other features are intriguing:  Drink ReOrder and Paying your bill.   We used the kiosk to pay our bill and it was kind of nice not to have to wait for our check to arrive, then wait for the server to come back to collect our payment method, and then wait again for the change or cc receipt to be returned.   There was the option to print your receipt (right from the kiosk) or e-mail it.   I didn't use the drink re-order feature but I think this could be convienient during busy hours... just queue up your drink order at the bar and your server can just bring it over, again eliminating some of that back and forth waiting. The other thing I noted was Dual Flush toilets for water conservation, of which I'm a fan :) Our food was good and our waitress was very nice. We did find it a bit loud in there last night between the music and other patrons.  While the noise level didn't really bother my husband and I, good to note for other visitors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury?start=20
Emily D.,"Hebron, CT",0,4,,1.0,5/10/2015,"Went on cinco de mayo and had an interesting experience. Our server who was at least 7 months pregnant was amazing and the food and drinks tasted great going down, but how sick I got after was not great. I most likely won't go back because of how sick the food made me, it happened to another friend recently and has been a huge turnoff ever since even though I am a huge fan! Very disappointing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury?start=20
Steve B.,"Glastonbury, CT",3,14,21,3.0,2/11/2015,"Not the best in town, but we always get a consistent experience with good food and service. My favorite dessert is the lava cake. I remember when they used to serve it in the hot skillet they cooked it in. I guess someone thought putting a hot skillet on the table was a bad idea because they now serve it on a plate. I feel it's missing something now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury?start=20
Meaghan S.,"Glastonbury, CT",0,3,,3.0,1/18/2016,I go to this chilis a few times a year. It's always hit or miss. This past Thursday our experience with takeout was pretty good. I don't remember the girls name but she was so nice and she made sure our order was correct. I loved how she repeated it back to me before I left! All take out should do the same. Nothing like getting home and realizing somethings aren't in the bag.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury?start=20
Mary W.,"Manchester, CT",62,85,47,3.0,5/23/2014,"This is me and my best friend's go to place in town. We somehow always end up at Chili's when we want to eat out, even if we make plans to go elsewhere. We get margaritas, always good. We enjoy the chips and salsa you got served right away. I always get guacamole, last time they made it right next to our table. Super delicious! I got the margarita flatbread and it was so good. I never finish my food because I always eat way too many chips. They are so good (and salty), I can't help it. Maybe too salty. It isn't over the top, but it's good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury?start=20
Pat B.,"New York, NY",0,14,,3.0,5/8/2014,"I'm usually reluctant to give mediocre reviews on franchises because one particular location shouldn't affect the others but as far as Chili's go, this one is pretty bland.  I've been to several chili's & by & large they are pretty good, especially the drinks & good beer selection.  I usually order from within the same 3-4 items so I think I have a basis for comparison. The quality of food & portion does not live up to it's sister restaurants. Twice the nachos were overcooked too a crisp & kind of flimsy with the toppings.  Although both times I've been there I've had to wait at the entrance for someone to find me a table, even though the restaurant wasn't that busy, the servers are polite & friendly but the food takes a little longer to get to your table than you'd expect.  Not a bad experience but I think ill opt for another place next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury?start=20
Juliana F.,"Glastonbury, CT",0,11,4,4.0,4/23/2014,"I want to recommend Glastonbury's Chili's for their great meals. They have set bar pretty high, especially for lunch. Good food, pleasant service and great price make it one of our favorite ""go-to"" places in town.

Claudia S.,"Manchester, CT",0,21,,4.0,2/10/2012,"I enjoy eating at this location more than the others. The service is always friendly and efficient.  The food's good too and as a chain, it obviously has the items prepared in certain manners, so you don't have to worry too much about getting a bum dish. It's not the greatest cuisine on the planet but it's nice for those moments when I feel like having comfort food. I love their Texas Chili & Cheese Fries and their Honey Chipotle Chicken quesadillas. Their drinks are okay, I personally think they're a bit overrated in that respect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-glastonbury?start=20
