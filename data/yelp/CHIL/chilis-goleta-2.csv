Tye G.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1,42,41,5.0,11/7/2017,"I see that this chili's is rated 2.5 stars over all and I am appalled. Chili's is awesome! All of you uptight Yelp snobs can take a chill pill. We are lucky to have chili's in the area. I did have the fajitas tonight and they were awesome. Chicken, shrimp and steak.... the prices are fair and the taste is great. If you're looking for excellent service, go next door to Jane and pay for it! My 7 year old gets entertained with a trivia game console that is offered by chili's. We have fun as a family trying to answer trivia questions together.  If you want 5 star service, request Victor. The guy is a top notch server and you will never have to ask for refills. The guy is all over the place. He's really engaging and friendly too. We came in 3 months ago and the guy knew what we ordered last time we were in. Incredible!  Here's what he looks like... ask for this guy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Brady Y.,"Summerland, CA",0,19,2,4.0,10/11/2017,"Thanks to server Aaron who is always happy and helpful whenever we are there having lunch or dinner.

Johnathan R.,"Goleta, CA",5,24,41,3.0,9/25/2017,"Chili's in goleta is a pretty decent place to dine if you have some time to kill. I've been here numerous times and I always come back because the food is enjoyable for the price.  Over the years that I've been coming here, the drinks, menu items and staff have changed BUT the service has not! The staff is friendly but dining here really eats away at your afternoon/evening. The service is slow and it always has been. I don't come here expecting top notch service, I come here for the price! Happy hour is great and if you are looking for a cheap date night, the two for one dinner special is definitely worth while. Don't forget to upgrade to margaritas!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
George L.,"Santa Barbara, CA",59,144,677,3.0,10/2/2017,"It's alright for a chain, though I have to say that I thought this particular Chili's wasn't bad. The 2 for $22 still applies and you can get decent ribs and standard food for the same price as fast foods, but with a fair quantity. Service was on point today and it wasn't overbearing. They even replaced a dish because one of my coworkers wanted a different item since he realized he didn't like the cheese in the quesadilla, hence no extra charge. Only problem is that none of the foods here catch my attention, probably since it's a chain. Yeah the food was aight, but I'll probably forget about this place in favor of Los Agaves or any other sitdown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Emily L.,"Santa Barbara, CA",17,30,44,2.0,3/31/2017,"A few friends and I came to Chili's for a Friday night dinner. Our server was great - very friendly and attentive and the food was decent.  What warrants the low review is how they handled their TVs: we asked them if they could change the channel on one or two of the TVs from collegiate basketball to a World Cup qualifier game. Our server happily complied and went to find the remote, but could only find it for one of the TVs. No problem. He then couldn't find the right channel for us. Also not a problem, by then we were almost done eating anyway.  However on our bill, they charged us $1.99 for something called ""table entertain."" (We didn't have one of those tablets at our table so it for sure wasn't because of that.) I wouldn't have cared about this fee if they had told us ahead of time or if they at least got the right channel. The fact that they slapped it on at the bottom of the check with no warning was what made it ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Michael J.,"Santa Barbara, CA",51,235,162,4.0,9/10/2017,"Dad got away with lunch for six people for only $54! Prices can be very reasonable here. Food was all good and everyone was happy.

Jennie K.,"Washington, DC",97,263,459,3.0,2/16/2017,"Went to Chili's tonight after realizing that Los Agaves was closed for the day of immigrants protest (much respect). There were plenty of empty tables, but apparently we had to wait for a table... I guess they're understaffed? Most of us were hangry at the time so we decided to just sit at the bar. Luckily, we came right at happy hour, so we got $3 cheese curds and $3 fried pickle apps- now being Canadian, I take my cheese curds seriously. The fry on the curds was hot, and not burnt which is exxxxcellent! The fried pickles were okay- nothing special, and piping hot (but I'd rather food come out piping hot than lukewarm).  Our server was good- she was friendly and accommodating, but I felt like she didn't really come to check on us too much. It was a little weird to me considering it didn't seem all that busy when we were there. That's why I'm removing one of the stars. I got the ribeye- I should stop letting my love for steak blind me. Chilis probably isn't the best place to get steak. The ounces were not stated on the menu- you should definitely put that on there. The steak cut itself looked sad- lots of fat all accumulated in a gross pile, and wasn't nicely marbled at all. The loaded mash was meh, and the corn on the cob was hot (which is great) but was only seasoned with a sad sprinkle of pepper. Yelp users would cry seeing corn that sad. I don't want to bust on Chili's for being a place that serves mediocre food, but I'll admit, while the cheese curds were excellent and canada-approved, everything else was just... meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Pinn S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",62,39,74,3.0,2/17/2017,"Went to Chili's on a Thursday night with my Yelp Elite friends. We got some appetizers that are okay. I ordered the special smokehouse combo -- bone-in bbq chicken and chicken crispers that came with corn, garlic bread, fries, and pickles -- all for $14.99! The corn was amazingggg, but the rest on that plate was ok. The chicken, especially, was a bit cold. The fries were good, springy had a nice texture.  The staff was nice but we were seated at a high table and stools right below a tv screen when there were tables available left and right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Michael R.,"Goleta, CA",172,38,20,4.0,4/28/2017,"Chili's is not my first pick when it comes to good ol' American food but I do enjoy most of the times I have been here.  The service is usually great, the waiters are attentive and kind even when they are super busy. The food tastes great also, I have never had a bad experience with this. One big negative though, is the men's bathroom. Usually it is a mess here and for some reason, always out of paper towels! Also they do have pretty good margaritas, probably one of my favorite places for margaritas. However, I did have a couple bad experiences where the shaker I got my margarita on would spill every time I poured myself a cup. This made the whole table dirty and the second time, the waiter did not acknowledge it at all. The first time though, despite the mess the waitress was very kind and brought me another drink free of charge after seeing half of it spilled.  Be aware of some wait times during peak times.  Cheers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Natasha B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",32,92,51,1.0,3/11/2017,"Stay away. I have never had good service here. Although the food is exactly what you would  expect from a chili's, the service leaves much to be desired. Especially now, since they have those tablets to order, the experience of dining out is even worse. I will never go back to this chili's. Also, be warned- playing the games on the tablets costs money. Read the fine print before you get an unpleasant surprise on your bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Marc S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",332,81,166,3.0,2/12/2017,"Chilli's in Goleta had me puzzled a couple times about what I think about the place. Honestly, every time I go I have a different experience regarding the service. The restaurant could be packed and the service great/ the food arrives quick, or it could be completely empty with a really slow service. I've waited between 10-15minutes to 45 minutes for an enchiladas. Regarding the food, it's decent. Lots of choice and they will make your order however you like it. Side note, their paying station where you can pay/play games for a dollar (?) are often broken, out of paper to print your receipt or just off. It's a shame because it's an ingenious system but it's not being maintained properly. 3.5 stars. Good for late night dinner with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Heather S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",2,27,6,5.0,9/16/2017,"I love this place. My favorite appetizers are the cheese fries, chips and salsa, and the cheese skillet.

Phillip F.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,23,4,3.0,9/24/2017,"Summary: The food was better than average, but the service was poor. Details: I had an excellent hamburger, but the chili that came with it was rather liquidy--more like a sauce than what I was expecting.  Other members of my party also had mixed reviews on their meals.  The overall food quality was better than average, but not fantastic.  Service was definitely sub par.  It was difficulty to get someone to take our order, and hard to get water glasses refilled.  A device was left on our table, and until we asked, no one mentioned that we were supposed to use it to pay our bill.  Eventually, someone came to our rescue and discovered that the machine wasn't working.  The overall background sound level (music + TVs) was a bit higher than what I would have liked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Jimmy R.,"Goleta, CA",37,30,9,5.0,6/2/2017,"When me and my girlfriend feel like eating out our usual place to go is Chilis, with their awesome mixed drink selection and amazing appetizers it's a great place for dinner, lunch or a date night. The place is really nice and clean, I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. Their bathrooms are nice and tidy which is great because I usually don't go to the bathroom in public places unless I really have to, I don't mind it here. I do recommend their Tropical Sunrise Margaritas and the burger shots. So I highly recommend coming to Chilis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Nicole M.,"Goleta, CA",0,4,1,1.0,8/19/2017,"We ordered the 2 for $22, ordered the Spiced Panko Onion Rings with Crispy Chicken Crispers and Margarita Chicken. The ""Spiced"" Onion Rings were half-breaded and had virtually no flavor. The only seasoning seemed to be a small pile of cilantro on the top ring, we didn't even taste salt or pepper. The only thing we could taste was the oil, which to their credit was at least clean tasting.  The chicken crispers live up to their name. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find rocks crispier than them. Perhaps they stole some of that crispiness from the nearly soggy fries that came with them. The accompanying corn on the cob was flavorless under the butter that soaked it.  We also had the Margarita Grilled Chicken with broccoli and asparagus+garlic roasted tomatoes. The pico de gallo that comes on the chicken was the only flavor there, with the cilantro overpowering everything else. The broccoli and asparagus were both undercooked, with the asparagus also being underripe. I could hardly bite the stalks in half using both hands to pull them between my teeth. The tomatoes (6 barely ripe grape tomatoes) were so sour, they nearly made me gag.  We didn't bother complaining to the waitress as this was our first time eating here after swearing the place off months ago, and as such don't plan on coming back. Also, drinks aren't included in the 2 for $22 meal deal and are nearly $3 for sodas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Oliver K.,"London, United Kingdom",58,7,,1.0,6/24/2017,"The service is decent, but I haven't experienced them much as I mostly order takeout. The kitchen must certainly be the laziest I have ever encountered. I am not joking. I, with no restaurant experience, could run a better kitchen, and here are the reasons why: Occasionally food will arrive without any sides. They just forgot the sides like this is a job where they're helping their buddy move in exchange for no money or maybe cheap beer. Portion sizing is entirely arbitrary. Could it be a dozen onion rings? Could it be four onion rings? Who knows! Flip a coin! It costs six dollars either way. Oh yeah, and if I order a bowl instead of a cup then please, for the love of God, give me a bowl. Effectively, you took the advantage of me ordering takeout to steal two dollars from me. It's not even like this place is cheap. It is a horrid waste of commercial space.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2

Katie L.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,8,6,2.0,10/29/2017,"This place has seen better days. Seriously chili's you need to invest in this prime location! The bathrooms were dingy and had trash cans on the back of the toilet seats in every stall- why?! The strawberry lemonade was very watered down. The chicken fajitas were sad and the chicken was the same as my daughters on her chicken pasta plate. The only difference was that my chicken has a little fajita sauce splashed on, so it was really lacking in flavor. The cheese they included was that pre shredded mixed cheese and it has odd artifacts of other food and things in it. My husband said his cheeseburger was good. Overall it was a sad reflection of what was once a decent place. Fortunately it was inexpensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2
Erin K.,"Ojai, CA",320,1403,10421,3.0,5/24/2015,"Service seems to have improved at this Chili's.  Servers are prompt, attentive and the orders come out right!  The downside is that Chili's as a company discontinued some of our group's favorite foods such as the pretzel sticks and cinnamon apples.  Really too bad.   Food is good enough, restaurant is clean enough and meal was well-paced.  They have skillet cinnamon rolls now, but they weren't that exciting.  The only thing on my mind while eating them was how I'd rather be eating cinnabon because those would be 10X better.  Chocolate chip cookie skillet was great though.  Super rich and delicious.  Generally, we all liked our food and appreciated that they were able to accommodate special requests.  Our server even went so far as to suggest a different burger when my friend wanted hers so different it was cheaper to order it another way.  Very cool!  Good job Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2

James C.,"Lompoc, CA",1,120,70,1.0,2/18/2016,"Never again. Not. EVER. I would give this Chili's zero stars, if possible (what do you think, Yelp?). Some time ago, after shopping at the nearby Costco we decided to have dinner at Chili's.  I mean, Chili's spends a lot of money on video ads, so they must really know how to cook, right? Worst. Service. EVER.  I will never go back to this place, and none of my family will every eat here or at any other Chili's anywhere, ever (yeah, we were treated that badly...).     So, a party of 5 walks in...me, my wife, and our three teen-aged children, we are greeted and are shown to a table, where we sit...and sit...and sit.  No menus, no water, no waiter. Nobody checks on us; it's like we were seated in a no-man's land between warring waiters or something.  And our table was not stuck in a back corner; we were right in the main part of the dining room.  What the fluff? Twenty minutes goes by, then twenty-five minutes.  Many, many people are seated around us, having arrived after us, and all were being served. But nobody comes to our table to give us menus or take our orders or anything.  Finally I say to my brood, ""this is crazy; let's get out of here.""  On the way out I ask to speak to the manager, to whom I ask ""have you been to business school?

Her follow up was terrible too.  She never came around to fill up glasses or check on us.  I had to ask three different waiters to find our waitress.

When I get my food delivered, I realize that none of my entrees have sides and the restaurant didn't include the sauces I requested.  So I call the restaurant and the young lady who answers it was already slightly rude.  I let her know that my entrees were missing their sides.  She says ""Oh I was the one who packed them.  I probably forgot to check the boxes before I packed them because I was busy with a rush.  I mean.. the only thing I can tell you to do is come back and get fries"".   Uhmm NO. If I could go into the restaurant myself, I wouldn't have paid the extra $6 for delivery.  I tell her that I would like a refund or something.  And she says, ""I mean I can get a manager to speak with you, but they're busy"".  So she takes my name and my number down so that the manager can contact me back. I'm still waiting to hear back from them.  Meanwhile, I guess I'll just enjoy my sideless entrees.

Amber L.,"Goleta, CA",9,32,8,1.0,1/19/2015,"Most... Disappointing... Visit... So to start the experience, my coworker called ahead and to let them know we'd have a larger party for 6:45pm.They messed that up and put 7:45pm. So once we got our table we placed our orders. I think the kitchen was cutting corners and it really showed. Out of 6 people 4 dishes had something wrong, 2 of which had to be sent back to the kitchen. One of our party members got the wrong burger, the correct one was being served to another table so they swapped them, and my ""steamed"" broccoli was completely raw. The two people that had their dishes sent back didn't get to eat till the rest of us where done. One of those dishes was the 3 meat fajita plate. There was a small sliver of steak, rather than just bringing a more appropriate portion they took the entire plate back. The worst part of this visit was that not once did a manager come talk to us to apologist or anything. It would have made our visit so much better if someone had tried to make it right.  I highly recommend going somewhere else if you want to eat during a busy time. Edit: I forgot to mention the check situation. We let them know ahead of time who was on what check and they got it mostly right, the only mix up was putting my coworkers beer on my tap.  When we ordered our food one of the party members let the waitress know she had a coupon. Then someone at the other end wanted to use one too. The waitress did not mention that there could only be one coupon per party. (the second member didn't even know the first had used one). When this was realized during the payment process the waitress said there was nothing they could do. After some back and forth they took care of it. So I am glad that they resolved that, however again we got no interaction with the manager about this.  On a personal note, I do not care for the electronic check system they have in place.

Jason M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",109,65,20,3.0,9/11/2014,"My fiancee and I unfortunately live in Goleta so this is one of our regular places to go. The prices are okay, the food is decent and the service works. We always sit at the bar and because we do the bartenders have gotten to know us which is why I give it a 3 stars. They have lots of TVs so you can watch whatever you want. They need to figure out how to get Dodger games so we can watch them (I know it is not their fault but Zodos gets the games, why can't Chiles?) The fajitas are delicious, their chips are always fresh and their guacamole is almost as good as home made. If you're looking for a familiar place with decent prices, come here.  If you are a visitor to Santa Barbara, get the heck out of Goleta and go to down town SB and enjoy something unique.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2?start=40
Carl J.,"Lompoc, CA",1,100,,3.0,2/8/2016,"We had lunch here on a Sunday because the restaurant is conveniently located next to the farmer's market.  We usually have good experiences at Chili's, but we've noticed that there no longer is consistency and that the value has gone down. The Mex bowl my wife ordered tasted good, but it did not match the description completely. Not listed on the menu was the rice that filled the bottom of the bowl. She would have liked to see more meat than ""fillers"". My chicken sandwich did not meet my expectations and the gadget sitting on the table that I was supposed to use to pay was a major hassle.

Chili's is just a chain restaurant, one step above a Denny's basically and though the service was OK, nothing to complain about there, The food is boring and I mean, if you were stopping in here for a quick lunch on the run that would be one thing but to take a date here or have an anniversary or a monumental 21st birthday is just ridiculous. Let me give you a good hand here if you take a first date out on a dinner date and you end up with them forever do you really want to have to tell the story over and over about the first date being at a freaking Chili's?

The hostess greeted us and seated us immediately. We sat outside in one of their large tables. We ordered some of their appetizers: mozzarella sticks, artichoke dip, cheesy nachos, chili fries and chips n salsa. The appetizers were the best microwavable food I've tasted in a while. They were warm enough to pass off as fresh. The chili fries, on the other hand, got cold as soon as the breeze from our hand reached for a fry. The artichoke dip was the best tasting appetizer.  The drinks did arrive promptly. One of my professors ordered one of their margaritas that comes with an additional Corona beer. The tequila they use for the margarita is Jose Cuervo, which scared by itself, but with the addition of corona I immediately took away her keys... and she wasn't even driving I was that scared. My Dos Equis came with a cold mug that actually warmed up my beer when I poured it in the mug.  I ordered their cajun chicken pasta that was your run-of-the-mill pasta that wasn't impressive. There was nothing in my dining experience that impressed me or for that matter just say, ""ok"". They do have good happy hour prices and I did try one of their margaritas that was strong, which I do like. They're not skimpy with their alcoholic beverages.

When we confirmed that yes, we are, he said usually vegetarians order it without the bacon on top and that we should just do that and we would ""Survive."" yes, those were his exact words. We asked if he could ask the chef, and he said ""okay, I'll look in the computer. It comes out of a bag and we heat it up."" Ummmmm, in that case never mind. I guess I should have realized because I mean, it's Chili's, but it was one of the only places open. But really, why would you tell your customers that your soup comes out of a bag that you heat up?

My 8 year old chose not to eat. My husband and I got the fajitas and the meat was half of what I expected and the shrimp I am fairly certain was not fully cooked (translucent). To top it off they forgot the condiments so we had to flag someone down for those.

Does anyone at Chili's or other chain restaurants know how to bartend? Bartend = Bar + Tending to your customers. The bartender who served me, what's her name? Oh, I have to look at my receipt to see what her name is because she never introduced herself: Marissa.  Now she was very nice, smiled, very pleasant, even said, ""How are you doing"". And she was very apologetic about my order coming out incorrect. But a ""bartender"", no. A person behind the bar who is nice offering very basic service, yes. But this is the Chili's management's fault! This is the third time service at the bar is poor to well, nonexistent. She conversed more with staff in the back then any of ""her"" customers. And I don't think the staff will offer her a gratuity for the chatter. In fact, she never talked to any of her customers (four) except to ask them if they wanted something. But again, she was very nice and apologetic.  Now the food, Mushroom burger, fries extra crispy, side of 1000 island. Got the food, no 1000, and the fries were not only limb, but were not even warm, basically cool... but not cold. Burger was nice and hot though. Had to ask for my 1000 (as soon as I ordered it, she should have gotten a side of it and put it in front of me). She asked me if my fries were crispy, I said no, they weren't even warm. She offered to replace them but I'm so tired of getting food replaced. The restaurant wasn't all that busy.  When I received my bill, someone (management) had taken 25% off for the lousy fries. I thought that was interesting as half my meal was of poor quality. I guess they had a calculator in the back and figured out what the gross food cost was for the fries, or something like that, or something like the manager didn't really give a shi#!. And when you think about it, no manager even came around to apologize. I guess this Chili's has so many complaints he/she gets tired of apologizing (very possible).

Bri D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",75,18,9,3.0,9/2/2014,"I came here to eat dinner with a friend. When we got there, they were pretty busy. Which is understandable. They have always had good food and good service. We waited about 10 minutes and the hostess took us to our table. We looked at the menu and picked out our order. About 15 minutes went by and we started staring around the room to try to identify who was supposed to be helping us. A young lady with long brown hair finally acknowledged us and said she'd be right with us. She was very nice and very apologetic. She took our full order (Texas fries appetizer, chicken enchiladas, buffalo chicken salad, an iced tea and a water). We waited about 10 minutes and out came our entrees. No appetizer and no drinks. The waitress came over to check in on how the food tasted and I laughed saying we were waiting for the rest of the order. She apologized and got everything to our table. I got about 2 bites into the chicken enchiladas and the food was cold in the center. I have only sent food back once in my life and I felt so bad to tell her that there was a problem with the food. She took it back and brought me a new entrée. We never saw our waitress again after that. I started the payment process at the table since they have kiosks at each table. When she saw me doing the payment she came over and said, ""I'm going to grab you another iced tea."" We sat there for another 5 minutes just chatting. She came back and asked if we wanted a to go box. She left and came back with the box and the iced tea.  We left the restaurant and went over to Best Buy. About an hour later, I threw everything up that I ate. I'm not sure what it was about the food, but it really didn't sit well. I went back to let them know in case there was a problem with the chicken enchiladas I ate. I asked for the manager and a middle aged gentleman came out with a go-tee. I let him know about my overall experience with this visit and he immediately got defensive. He started out by saying, ""Well, first off, food poising takes 6-12 hours to take effect."" That may be true, but he totally missed the point. Then he went on to say that it could have been the temperature of the food that made my stomach unhappy. I wasn't trying to get anything out of it except for an apology for my experience. I never got that from him. I just got a lecture on food poisoning and blame placement on food I may have eaten earlier.  I went over to my parents house after because I did not want to be home alone not feeling good. I told him about my experience because I was really upset about the whole ordeal. My dad called the restaurant asking for the managers name and company information to draft a letter to corporate regarding the experience and the way the manager handled my comments to him. The hostess put him on hold and the general manager picked up. We explained what happened and he immediately apologized for my experience and said he'd have a meeting with the manager regarding his response. Who knows if they ever did that. But for the fact that the GM picked up and apologized, this would have been a 1 star review. All I was after was an apology, which I never got from the manager. I am in the customer service industry and even if it's not your fault, the first response to a negative experience is ALWAYS, ""Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry that happened! Can I have your name and number to follow up with you tomorrow to find out how you are feeling?"" My perception would have been totally different. Again, if we would not have talked to the GM, we would have never come back. Just for the record, he did not give us a discount, refund our meal or offer anything for the next time we came in. We did not ask and he didn't offer. Again, I was not trying to get anything from them other than an apology. Once I got that from the GM, I was fine.

It was my first time ever leaving a restaurant, and without even ordering. Our server was awful and cocky.  Sat for over 20 minutes and waited, and waited.

Cris F.,"Goleta, CA",0,6,,2.0,3/17/2015,"My last visit here I came around lunch time before heading to work. And you would expect there to be some sort of lunch rush hour in chilis but nope the place barely had any people in it, which was a good thing cause that means the food would come out faster right ? WRONG. There were several things that went wrong with this visit.  1. The server did not introduce herself so I can't really name who it was but she was blonde. She gave me and the other 5 people I was with, with terrible service. Barely checking up on us, and even sometimes avoiding our table for some reason lol.  2. The wait for the food took almost 2 hours. Pretty ridiculous for there only being 5 other tables occupied.  3. When we finally got our food it was served ICED COLD not even warm. I ordered a chicken quesadilla salad. And they served me this processed chicken with browned lettuce.  4. I just think this place has lost its touch c'mon step it up chilis you used to be A1! ):",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2?start=60
laysa r.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,8,4,1.0,11/17/2014,"Had a terrible experience here this weekend. While we were waiting people kept coming up seeing is they could pay for their food with the hosts (bad sign no. 1) and they would just tell them no you can't and just let them stand there instead of getting their server for them. There were plenty of open tables but no one was being sat. Now, I've worked at restaurants and I thought well maybe they don't want to slam the kitchen by seating too fast so I cut them some slack. We final got sat and it only got worse from there.  Took our server 15 mins to come say hi and get our drink order. No sorry about the wait guys, nothing. By that time we were starving so we put in our orders for food too. Took another 5 mins for waters to be brought out. 10mins for the guacamole and chips (so grease soaked you could see through them). We gobbled those up quickly and waited...and waited..and waited.  All this time instead of coming and checkin in on us our server played the ostrich in the sand game and would avoid eye contact with us so we couldn't even get more chips. 30 mins after that we got 4/6 orders delivered.  He said the other two would be right out so everyone started eating. Everyone else finishes their food and we're still waiting on the last 2 sandwiches.  15 minutes later we get one avocado bacon sandwich with guess what..NO AVOCADO on it.  It's right in the name and there's no avocado.  Few minutes later we get the last sandwich with also NO AVOCADO AND MISSING THE BOTTOM SLICE OF BREAD! Soggy cold fries. The sandwich which I waited two hours for was incomplete and inedible.  We were pretty upset at this point obviously and the server pretty much said "" yeah it sucks. Don't blame us for being pissed"". No service recovery, no manager coming over, NOTHING. We were comped the two late sandwiches but still completely terrible experience. DONT GO HERE! Save your money and go ANYWHERE else. I was even regretting not going to the McDonalds across the way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2?start=60

The texmex selection is decent though. The main course options in the 2 for 20 deal are not great.

Ida G.,"Philadelphia, PA",108,271,10,4.0,12/20/2009,"I can't understand why this place is getting such bad reviews. This isn't a fine dining experience, people, it's Chili's!  Even so, I've been going here at least a couple times a month for about a year, and have never had a bad experience. They have a great deal right now where $20 gets you an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert, giving you enough yummy food to completely stuff two people. Their buffalo chicken wings are awesome, as are every single one of their burgers (as I said, I go there regularly) and their fries. Their ribs are always delicious too. The El Presidente margarita is one of my favorite drinks on the planet. The bar area is pretty cool too, and I've sat there a couple times with friends and enjoyed it, although I prefer to sit in the main restaurant area as the televisions by the bar are too loud to be able to carry a conversation. Families come here, and it's almost always busy, so don't be too appalled if the table next to you is a mess for a few minutes. Again, Chili's is not a fine dining experience. It's just good, reasonably priced food in a relaxed atmosphere. I had a bizarre experience with a server who brought us our appetizer and entrees at the same time. We were close to the kitchen, so we could hear him yelling at the chefs about the timing right before he came out. I was halfway through my margarita at that point, so I thought it was pretty funny. Apart from that one occasion, the service has been consistently pleasant and prompt every time.  I think that people only bother to review Chili's when they happen to go once and have a bad experience. I have dined there dozens of times and always walked away satisfied, and I think you will too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2?start=100

Their bottomless chips and salsa are THE BEST ever.

John B.,"Goleta, CA",6,25,,4.0,2/23/2017,"Ate with a group of 8 tonight. We were pleasantly surprised. Service was great - server, Victor,  went above and beyond. Can't remember the last time I shook a waiter's hand upon leaving. Hamburgers, chicken salads, steak were all good. I had the Southern Smokehouse Berger, and it was very good. Wife had the Chicken Marsala salad, another the carnitas tacos. All excellent. Bottom line, good deal, good food. Then we were off to the bar. Pleasant evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2?start=20

Marianne B.,"Ontario, CA",30,16,2,5.0,5/18/2016,Love this Chili's. Always reliable and comfortable. Have had Angela as a waitress twice now and she's wonderful. It was so oddly crowded on a Wednesday night and she was tending 10 tables! We even noticed her having to bus her own tables. All with a lovely perky and sweet attitude. Thank you again Angela! See you next time,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2?start=20
Nels H.,"Goleta, CA",36,10,,3.0,8/5/2016,"Food is okay, only reason I'm giving three stars is because the service is kinda slow. Went in around 3ish and there was about, 18 people in whole restaurant. And still was serviced a bit slow. The waiter was great and friendly didn't catch his name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2?start=20

Shane G.,"Goleta, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/24/2010,"I accidentally left my $40 hat in a booth. I called them within 5 minutes of leaving the restaurant, they refused to to look for it, they did not ask me where I left it, didn't ask for my name & number were they to find the hat later, and just told me to call the next day. I stopped by the following day and they had not found the hat, and was treated with no respect. Their lack of common courtesy and respect is disappointing, as is the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goleta-2?start=120
