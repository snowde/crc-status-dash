Guy W.,"Gonzales, LA",125,4,,3.0,5/8/2015,"Had lunch today, the shrimp tacos were excellent but the speed of service was terrible, they weren't very crowded for lunch but still took over 30 minutes to get my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=20

Ashley H.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,7,,2.0,11/12/2014,"This place only keeps its business because of the mall. My margarita glass was still dirty and sticky, with blackberry pieces stuck along the inside. You could clearly tell that the person before me had drank the muddled blackberry margarita in it. I bartend and I always check my glasses before I serve them..

cat w.,"Houston, TX",77,186,78,1.0,1/23/2013,It started ok. It was really quiet in there. Girl took our order for appetizer and entres. The appetizer and entres arrived at the same time which sucked but I wasn't overly bothered. The appetizer was fine apart from the celery which was going rotten at the sides. We had loaded potato skins which tasted good.  I had the quesadilla salad which I didn't eat much of as it didn't taste great but I figured that might just be me and also because after seeing the celery I didn't have much trust in their food hygiene or freshness. My mother had the mango chicken dish off the lighter options menu. It didn't look too much like in the picture and she ate all of it but wasn't impressed. Shortly after eating she was very ill. Not very impressive and I've never had a problem at a chili's before.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=20

Claire S.,"Prairieville, LA",0,4,,1.0,9/23/2012,"I visited Chili's for a to-go order in Gonzales, LA. My order was simple: chocolate shake and queso/chips.  I ordered at 8 PM, was told it would be ready for 8:30 PM. I arrived at 8:25 PM to find a short line at the to-go area. It was 8:45 PM before anyone acknowledged I was standing there, I repeated my order, then watched as they put my order in to the chefs. It was 9:10 PM before I got my food. The staff were nice, but disorganized. In fact, the girl before me was checked out for the wrong ticket, waited 20 minutes more for it to be corrected and get her order. The lady in line behind me became very agitated because she too had not been recognized she pushed her way to the front to make sure her food was coming. There were 2 checkout computers running at the desk, someone should have addressed those in line and seen if they could help in a timely fashion. The agitated lady's order was cold and not correct either. Some suggestions: ~ Improve organization of takeout staff. ~ Improve customer service & professionalism. ~ Put takeout service in a place where customers cannot see or hear their orders       being put in, or see staff joking around while customers wait. Or simply put up a       door of some kind. People become even more impatient if they can see people     doing nothing while waiting for long time for to-go orders. I will not be returning to this Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=20
Roger E.,"Lake Charles, LA",4,213,1,1.0,7/21/2013,"Got there at 2:00PM way after the lunch bunch for a table for 2. Was told the wait was10-15 min. I asked the host why such a long wait since there were plenty of open tables as well as one right in front of us. No comment and was handed a beeper. Low and behold the beeper goes off after 10 min and we are seated at the table right in front of us. The same one I asked about. After our waiter discovered we were there we placed our order and I suggested that we go to the Cracker Barrel that I can see out the window. Wife says No. Next is the sandwich and salad that comes after a 35min wait. We were told that the cook miscounted and that was the reason for the late salad.  Yah, yah, yah. The worst thing is that as I was working through the sandwich that was made of cardboard and wood I was looking at Cracker Barrel and imaging the pecan pancakes. Cruel. Anyway we licked our wounds (not our plates) and bowed out never to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=20
Jeff P.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,1,,1.0,5/17/2015,The place is bush league. Nobody in line and the hostess says it is a 45 minute wait. Upon inquiry she says a station just closed. Really! It is 7pm Sunday night,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=20
Stephen W.,"Oceanside, CA",111,33,17,1.0,3/14/2015,"2pm we asked for a table for 2 and was told it would be 20min. No problem. 30min passed so I asked for an update. 2 in front of us. Ok. Great. Got the page a few Murr's later. As we were waiting to be seated, the waitress placed another couple at our table. I made it obvious that I was not pleased. That couple didn't even have a pager!! So we Sat down and quickly ordered 2 salads. Quick bite before shopping. 40 minutes passed. In that time another group sat next to us - ordered and got their food. Another table that sat down before us and had not gotten food yet. When they asked the waitress she pointed at my table and said ""they only ordered salads and don't have their food yet"" I laughed. The table getting service got another course delivered! Wow. Then the table that complained started getting their food... Cold! So they sent it back. The manager came over and started making excuses! I'm scratching my head at this point. My daughter and I have gotten zero service since ordering our salads. I asked her is she was ok with switching restaurants... There's a subway across the parking lot. ""Sure, we will probably eat sooner and enjoy it better"" she replies. So we just leave. We only had water to drink, so we didn't owe them any money for items served yet. We love the food at chilies. I know it's not cooked on site and it's just glorified ""fast food"" but the prices are reasonable and its overall better for you than McD or Burger King. As we were leaving I warned those holding pagers about our experience. My daughter made an observation that I quickly echoed... There was a distinct difference between the tables getting served and the ones not. The same difference between those holding pagers and those getting seated without pagers. What we had different with those getting prompt service shared with the staff and management of the restaurant. I will not be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=20
Suzie W.,"Geismar, LA",3,34,10,1.0,12/30/2012,"The place is shockingly awful.  Rude staff.  Been here two different times for a lunch meeting.  Everyone in the group went away unhappy.  Menu items are woefully under prepared.  Honestly, I am not sure how they stay in business unless its traffic from I-10.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=20
Jason D.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,3,1.0,8/11/2014,"As a local patron to this Chilis, I would not recommend eating here for now.  Since summer started the food and service has gone down hill.  Back in June, we wasted an hour of our life on our food to arrive after we ordered it. Manager was not helpful, didn't even get a discount for bad service. Today, the restaurant was not that busy. They were training. We ordered the trio fajitas, steak was medium rare chicken was cold and raw. returned them for extra cooking, chicken was still on the raw side. I think, the cooking staff was training too. also,  the manager must be new too. waited 20 minutes extra for cheesecake. Really pathetic!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=20

Karla B.,"Kenner, LA",0,15,1,1.0,8/15/2015,"They suck!  In fact I've never been to a Chilis that was horrible on all accounts, when you enter you are greeted with nothing, the hostess was talking with co workers about plans for night, when she did look up, no smile, and just said ""name"" then there was food all over the floors and seats, we asked about sitting in the bar area, lots of tables but all dirty, and the servers walked at a snails pace, after being seated we thought ok this girl at least is smiling, it took her 15 minutes to come back over to us and when we didn't like a margarita and wanted something different that's when things went south, nasty, rude, rolled eyes, didn't stay to hear other questions and concerns, didn't care, then the roach appeared!  I don't want to eat or pay for anything, gross discussing, only if you are coming out of 30 day starvation from the desert would I say go there, but I'm not sure the roaches will let you eat",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=20
Amanda A.,"Prairieville, LA",0,8,,2.0,3/14/2010,"I had to ask if this location was affiliated with the same Chili's as the rest of the nation? The salsa seemed liked Tositos and was really salty. The dinning room had empty seating, with a 45 minute wait??? We sat at the bar, and the bartender did the best she could while serving the hard core drinkers. The chicken was just as good as usual, but I don't think anyone here is paying attention to the details (burnt fries, no utensils, and no presence of management).

We left $30 worth of brand new feeding items for our son at our table, and went back an hour later to recover them. The staff AND manager nonchalantly said that they threw our stuff away because it's not their responsibility to hold them for any period of time.

Brooke B.,"Metairie, LA",559,16,32,1.0,7/30/2017,"This was one of my worst dining experiences. After moving my son to LSU we stopped by for a ""quick"" bite, there were many empty but unclean tables. The hostess was overwhelmed but sat us at a clean bar table. It took over 10 before the waitress came by just to say she would be right back. It took over 30 minutes to queso. Two table got theirs before us. She did not admit she forgot. Then there were used chips in it. She forgot my beer & then could not even deliver my salad which looked nothing like the menu pic. I asked for dressings on the side which she forgot & brought them after I had completely lost my appetite. Her name was Jodi. However on a positive note the bartender Ashley the was awesome. She was serving a full bar + getting drinks for servers, and poured my beer in less time then Jodi gave attention our whole meal. Which was not much.

Bruce L.,"San Dimas, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Just had a terrible lunch experience at this Chili's.  Our party was 4 adults, and 2 small children. The adults ordered the unlimited soup and salad. The kids pizza and fries. We were given drinks right away and things were looking good.  But then nothing for 30-minutes.....No waiter or food......We were then asked if we wanted drink refills and were given water in a dirty glass and the waiter again disappeared. At 50-minutes, 3 of our 4 salads came --- no soup or any of the kids' food.  Amazing that it took so long for basically a side salad and the waiter apparently could not count to 4. At 60-minutes, the 4th salad came --- still no soup or kid's food. At 70-minutes we tried to find a manager or any waiter who might be able to help us at least get some fries for the kids.  The 2nd additional waiter got the kid's food in about 5 minutes.  Our waiter and soup were still missing. At 75-minutes the now tired and hungry kids food came. At 80-minutes lukewarm soup came in very small bowls.  80-minutes to get the soup lukewarm -- I wonder how long hot soup would take. Not once during this time were we asked if we wanted any more of our unlimited menu choice. At 85-minutes we got to-go boxes for kids food and left.  Amazingly the waiter was there when we were paying by machine at our table. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  If you do go, order a side salad and a bowl of soup.  It will be bigger and less expensive than the unlimited order.  Also, bring something to do while you are waiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales

Claudio F.,"Denham Springs, LA",106,4,3,3.0,11/25/2015,"I came here after a busy day of errand-running with my friend in hopes of a good meal. We started off with the skillet queso appetizer which was surprisingly delicious, although mildly over-salted, and filling! I then ordered the Bacon Ranch quesadillas which did not live up to my expectations. They were small and bland, without much flavor at all. The portion size was roughly 8 small quesadillas approx 1.5"" long. I do not recommend these based on portion size and lack of taste. My drink however, a mango Arnold Palmer, was absolutely delicious! A tropical mix of lemonade and sweet tea with mango flavors made this drink an amazing one. A really interesting part about this restaurant was that each table had a small tablet with which you could view the menu (extremely limited in this aspect), place orders, play games, and pay the bill. A very interesting piece, but almost removes the need for waiters and waitresses altogether if you think about it. Our waiter was very polite and refilled our drinks appropriately and informed us of when our food would be ready. Could not have really asked for better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales
Holly T.,"Gonzales, LA",0,1,,1.0,11/27/2016,"We waited 30 minutes just to order our appetizer and drinks. Not one time did we see our server!

Roxanne K.,"Augusta, GA",58,741,547,3.0,9/22/2014,"This Chili's serves the same fair as most, but the ""small"" lunch portion of fajita as a bit of a joke. Not much for veg in it... I ate here for a lunch and two dinners in a week and had different experiences. I can easily see how the reviews are mostly bad, especially related to service.  We had an amazing server during dinner one night, a great one during a lunch and then a not so great one for another dinner. Inconsistency is a killer for any business.  I liked how easy it was to get things special on my order and I loved the 2 for one happy hour specials.

Eric B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2128,5344,4760,3.0,11/13/2013,"I was in the area for an almost 2 week business trip. Our Host's preferred Hotel was the nearby Hampton Inn, which provided a variety of chain restaurants for our dining ""pleasure"". We were often too busy or tired to go further down the road and at the end of a long day, these places were good enough.  This part of the I-10 Corridor seems to have a server shortage, as evidenced here by cordoned off sections of the restaurant. Our waitress mentioned that she had started only a few days prior, and was eager to please. However, we didn't see her that much as she got pulled away a lot.  Business trips can often involve a lot of food and not always the most nutritious kind. Hence, I went for the salad, even though that choice isn't always the most healthy. For me and the rest of our group, the food was decent and came out with decent speed.

We waited to close to 5 minutes before anyone came to seat us. Then we got to overhear our servers arguing over who would take the table. Our server, Melissa, was great. She was very gracious during our entire experience. Our food took over 25 minutes to arrive.  When it did, you could clearly see it had been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time. The food was overcooked and cold. It was completely inedible. After talking to the manager, Steve, he brought us fresh french fries, but that was it.  He made an insincere apology and really didn't seem to care at all. On his way over to our table, he stopped to talk to another table, then was checking salt shakers on other tables before stopping to speak with us. His apology was completely inauthentic and he made no offering of remaking our other food that we were very obviously not eating. Neither myself nor my husband asked for our food to be comped or anything taken off our check.  We just wanted the manager, Steve, to actually care about our terrible experience. He most certainly did not, and we will be escalating our complaints to ensure this restaurant gets some proper training and leadership. It is absolute dire need of both.

Our table was dirty when we were seated, my seat was dirty, my menu smelled like vomit, my wife's menu was disgusting and covered in something gross.  We both had to take turns washing our hands just from touching the menus.  Some guy in the kitchen scraped french fries off the work table barehanded and placed them onto a plate that went out to the dining room and was served to a customer!  We ordered anyway, despite my pleas, the wifey wanted to stay...When my salad arrived, I noticed something on the side of the plate that did not belong there.  I sent it back with our waitress who informed me that is was OK because they wear gloves in the kitchen.  Gloves are good if worn properly.  You MUST change gloves and wash hands between each and every task!  At this point, I made the decision that I could not eat there and I cancelled the orders.  Mind you of course, the wife wanted to stay so now I am hungry, disgusted, pissed off, and in the dog house!  Thanks Chilis!  Anyway, the ""manager"" came out of the kitchen, yeah that's right he was in the kitchen the whole time looking at the pig-pen they were working in and he allowed it to go on, not just that but he did nothing to fix it so it shows he does not care about the restaurant, the business, the employees, or the customers!  He asked what was wrong. WHAT IS WRONG!?!  Everything is wrong man!  I got out of my seat and this is where my wife got really pissed, I walked into the kitchen and pointed everything out to the guy.  Then the french fry guy came over and I explained what I saw that guy do to him right in front of the guy so I am not talking big stuff behind people's backs...I called them on it and I left.  Oh yeah, as the manager was making excuses, I informed him that I am an Executive Chef so he cannot BS me.  I offered to pay for our chips and salsa and our drinks.  He said he would take care of it and we left.  I did not yell, scream, or go around telling others not to eat there.  I am not trying to hurt their business but come on chili's in Gonzales, get your stuff  together!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=40
LKS S.,"Lake Charles, LA",0,5,1,3.0,1/29/2011,Waitress good. Service fast for a Saturday . Been to a lot of Chilis so this one was one of the better ones. Had ceasar salad which was fresh. My husband had chicken sandwich which he did not complain about. And the presidents Margarita was awesome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=40
Harrison M.,"Cypress, TX",13,121,,3.0,9/26/2008,Stopped in here mid afternoon when business was slow.  The service was slow.  The food very good.  I would have rated this a 4 star if the service had been a little better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=40
Sachin A.,"Glenview, IL",0,3,,2.0,5/9/2010,The food was good but the service was the one of the worst I have ever seen anywhere waiters have no ethics!!! I kept tip in cash and asked for cash back the waiter never came back to give me extra cash he took from me. Neither he came back to give us the box for the food we wanted. I guess he didn't want to give the money. I ended up almost paying 35% tip. I mean for the person who didnt even gave me boxes for left overs who keeps 35% tip!!! I will never recommed anyone to eat or dine to this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=40
David D.,"Geismar, LA",1,10,,4.0,1/13/2006,"Best chips and salsa in the world!  I am tempted to rate the resturant a 5 just for the salsa.  Margarita's are not half bad either.  If you've never been, Chilis is growing chain in the south that serves generic tex/mex.    The combo ribs/chicken is quite good and perfect for splitting betweeen me and the wife.  Ironically enough I used to really dislike their chili, but it is starting to grow on me, and is very reasonably priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gonzales?start=40
