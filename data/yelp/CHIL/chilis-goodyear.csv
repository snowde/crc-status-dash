Angelina R.,"Sun City West, AZ",37,64,10,3.0,5/7/2017,"Not really impressed. I usually order to-go. They never have my order ready when it should be. The portions are weak for the price paid and the quality is pretty poor. Asking for them to run coupons or discounts is like pulling teeth when you have to wait an extra 15 minutes while your food gets cold sitting there while someone locates a manager.  More distinctively remembered- the food was all carelessly thrown in cheap styrofoam containers that were melting from the heat of the hot food... the food that WAS hot until having to wait 15 minutes for a manager then the drive home. Applebees has legit quality plastic containers for to-go food. Why doesn't Chilis?? One thing I ordered was a side of grilled asparagus w/ Roma tomatoes & garlic. Sad presentation & portion for almost $10 of a charge! 4 weak, skinny, stringy strands of asparagus w/ 2 tiny bite-size cherry tomatoes and probably 10 pieces of garlic just thrown in a giant styrofoam container. I like garlic, but it was majority of garlic that I paid for. I could have gone & bought my own ingredients for half the cost of what this was.  I can't say anything else I ordered was worth it, either. It is like they bank on no one checking to-go orders before they carelessly throw tiny portions in crappy boxes. For the price paid, it was a ripoff and not worth it when it came to the quality of the food, either. And when you are offering coupons/discounts through email, those should be honored with no question, not having to make customers wait 15+ minutes to find a manager to approve what your company is marketing to begin with.  The least they did that was good was throw in an extra side of queso. Had it not been for that gesture, I probably would have left the food and asked for a refund. Please get your act together. I went to Applebees as an alternative and they blew Chilis out of the water with service, portions, quality & price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear
Nan M.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,34,14,2.0,11/5/2017,"There was a wait while the host cleared tables so he could seat other guests. Many uncleared tables. When he seated us, I asked the host if their bussers did not show up. He said there are no bussers. the servers are expected to clear the tables. Not sure how they're supposed to get it all done. They need more employees. Nachos were not hot. Were lukewarm. Place did not seem very clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear
Jim G.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,16,2,1.0,8/17/2017,I went to this location at 3PM on a Thursday to grab some food and do some work while I was waiting for my next appointment.  In order to do a little work I needed a booth with a power outlet.  I went into the bar and they said that the only table's with an outlet were in the dinning room.  So I went to the host/waiter and ask for a table with a power outlet.  I was then told that there wasn't a server in that section so I couldn't sit there.  I said that I needed a plug for my computer and that is when I was told that I would probably need to go somewhere else because they can't help me. WOW!! I was surprised they didn't want my business considering there was only like 4 tables sat in the whole restaurant.   So I went to Majerle's instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear
Christina D.,"Avondale, AZ",0,4,,1.0,1/7/2018,This restaurant is so dirty. I noticed it the min I walked in. The tables were filled with garbage and the floors were so filled with trash. Then we were seated and I went to wash my hands and had to walk by the kitchen and OMG it was a disaster!!!! Tortilla chips all over the floor and food all over the counter tops. I honestly am calling the manager tomorrow and I will never eat there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear
Dawn G.,"Olympia, WA",10,201,1320,3.0,1/12/2017,"We have dined at several Chili's restaurants and the visits are always just average..... We are never disappointed, but we are never blown away either. This visit was no exception. I was very happy with my meal and drink, the Mr thought his was just so so. He had the Chicken Ranch Sand which with Avocado added. I had the Smothered Smoked Chicken Burrito and thought it was very delicious. It was also huge and I took half home and it heated up great the next day too. The berry margaritas are really great too - I ordered the Triple Berry this time and on another visit the Pineapple Blueberry - both really great. And just like other reviews you will notice I only have pictures of the drinks..... I dig right into the food when it comes and forget photos! Sorry",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear

Patricia M.,"El Mirage, AZ",0,9,,1.0,3/29/2017,"Had lunch here yesterday around 3, every thing was fine. Myself, my husband and 4 year old daughter were sat at a both right behind the host stand. The service was great and the food was great at first.  My husband ordered the new chicken strip meal with blue cheese and buffalo sauce. It was cooked well and was crisp. Except it gave him food poisoning, BEWARE OF THE CHICKEN STRIPES. Most of the night and still as I write this he is in the bathroom sick as can be. I'm just greatfull our daughter did not try any of his food. This a really disappoint because we go to chili's about once a month as a treat for our daughter. But now it's not worth the risk of getting sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear
Maria G.,"Evanston, IL",20,11,4,1.0,8/2/2017,"Over the past few months the service has gone to crap! I'm a frequent flier here who loves their food. I had a to go order once and as we came to pick up the order the cook claimed that he made the food but yet it went missing. Today as we sat the server never came and finally I stopped someone after 15 minutes and gave our order, now waiting another 25 minutes considering they're not very busy the appetizers that we ordered wasn't even out yet. Even my child is asking why is it taking so long even though she's occupied playing with the kiosk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear

Hank W.,"Goodyear, AZ",3,36,15,2.0,6/4/2017,"Service was just bad, food came 40 minutes after ordering and the 2 stars are for another server trying to help and the Manager being genuinely helpful.

My sister declined You can just tell our oder sat for a while, fajita was not sizzling and the hamburgers bottom buns were soggy. Just a super disappointing all around experience.BUT my sister's remake food came  fast I have never been to this one but it's close to my house and I'll probably try again with football season on the way.

Cindy K.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,21,,3.0,5/20/2017,Management needs to review customers feedback and address issues accordingly. We have been coming to this Chili's for years. The food has been hit or miss the last several times and I always leave feedback on the kiosk When we pay our bill. Food portions shrinking and being served lukewarm. Floors dirty and Very few staff members smile. I never see a manager walking the floor checking on customers like at other local restaurants.

Gina B.,"Glendale, AZ",34,234,167,3.0,7/11/2016,I'm a regular of chili's but not this location it was actually my first time there.

Reese E.,"Surprise, AZ",1,88,1,1.0,5/1/2017,"So sad to be writing this because, we do like going to Chili's... just not at this location. My husband and I decided to stop by at this Chili's yesterday for lunch. The hostess was very nice and sat us down right away. Waited for a few minutes for our waitress. She took our drink orders, water for me and a Dos XX for my hubby with a lime. We also ordered the nachos, jalapenos and pico de gallo on the side. She didn't write it down and my husband said, our order was going to be wrong (I hate when he's right). She finally came back with our drinks, maybe 5 small ice cubes in each water glass (no joke) and a nice warm beer with no lime to go with it. My husband was going to ask for a new beer, but she never stopped by until the nachos arrived. Hubby was right, jalapenos were on the nachos and she said she told them jalapenos on the side. Now, she could have done 2 things, she could have told us what happened  before bringing them out and ask us if we still wanted them or she could have said, ""I saw that there were jalapenos on them so, I asked them to make a new one.""  Did not do either one. Food arrived, she didn't ask if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask for them. The restaurant was also disgustingly dirty. Tables that weren't cleaned from prior guests, floors filled with food and crap. It wasn't even that busy. The sad part was, the nice hostess was the one cleaning the tables, sweeping the floor, re-arranging the tables, AND seating people. All this time, she still had a smile on her face. We decided to tip the hostess since she was actually pleasant and was going above and beyond to keep the restaurant presentable. At some point, I'm sure we saw the manager attempting to clean a table, but we noticed he left it for someone else to clean up. Will never go back to this location. The hostess should get a raise for all the work she was doing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear
Meagan C.,"Glendale, AZ",0,15,2,1.0,9/3/2017,This is the worst Chilis we've ever gone to. We normally try to avoid this location at all costs because we almost always get horrible service.

Amy B.,"Tolleson, AZ",12,28,14,5.0,10/5/2016,"I was shocked to see this chili's only had a three star rating, I have loved this restaurant for years and even remember when it was built.  Anytime in the past that I had an issue and involved the manager it was fixed right away.  On today's visit I received the best service I have ever gotten at a chili's.  Logan was phenomenal.

Deni G.,"Avondale, AZ",1594,715,1998,3.0,7/16/2014,"Just kind of average .... no surprises  In the land of ubiquitous sit down chains, Chilis could be considred one of the leaders if not the king. On my visit to Chilis I ordered the queso dip and chicken dippers and my friend ordered the half rack of ribs with dry rub and a side order of barbecue sauce. My chicken dippers were somewhat greasy and the queso dip just didn't taste right .  My friends ribs were tasty but not a lot of meat on them. The waitress replaced the chicken dippers and gave me the spinach dip instead of the queso, and it was good.  The meal was definitely disappointing. The best part of the meal was the service, which was quick and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear

Very frustrating. There is no indication of how you are supposed to get in queue for a table. Really got upset when the lady said she would seat me right away, then the next one said 15 minute wait. The lady that said she would seat us right away just ignored us.  No not coming back. The food is not good enough   They have only service to offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear
Kathy S.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,1,,1.0,3/30/2017,"Had a late dinner last night around 9pm.  I ordered the new crispy chicken salad, which I thought from the pic was more like a spring mix (my bad for not asking), but it was mostly iceberg, which was extremely limp & looked pretty bad.  The waitress came back to ask how it was, where I normally wouldn't have even mentioned, I expressed my issues and she left for a minute & came back to replace the meal.  Although she wasn't a bad waitress, had she been an exceptional waitress, she would have asked if I would like the same item or something different, but a while later I received another salad, still with the same lettuce & still not looking great, but better than the first.  I did eat some of the lettuce & most of the chicken.  I paid the bill and went home only to start getting really bad stomach pains & then violently ill for at least a few hours.  Today still not feeling quite back to normal I decided to look up reviews and found someone earlier that day whose husband seemed to have had the same issue.  Don't think I'll be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear
Rachael K.,"Surprise, AZ",3,13,1,5.0,3/25/2017,"I have only come here to sit at the bar and watch hockey games. There's been the same bartender, Johnny, and he is all about the customer. We have always been treated attentively, he is on top of keeping the drinks refreshed, food served hot and makes sure everything is above satisfactory. I saw this place had some bad reviews, I can't vouch for anywhere but the bar service, but you will not be disappointed if you choose to sit at the bar. There was another couple sitting close by who made several good comments about the bartender as well. Great attitude, great service and he will make sure you're accommodated. I was watching a game to the side of us, and he changed the channel so I didn't have to watch with my head turned.  Didn't even ask, he just did it. So yep, Johnny is a great bartender/server here.

Jason R.,"Goodyear, AZ",124,1,,2.0,5/12/2016,"We came to Chili's instead of Macoroni Grill because my girlfriend received a gift certificate from her work and we had the choice between the two. Needless to say we made the absolute wrong decision. My girlfriend ordered a 6oz Sirloin with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. I ordered the mix and match combo with a half rack of ribs, steamed broccoli, and mashed potatoes. The ribs were served cold, the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box, and neither one of our steaks had any flavor whatsoever. The best part of the meal was the broccoli, how pathetic is that. The only reason I am giving this place 2 is our Bartender Malissa is a Rockstar! If we ever go back to Chili's it will be to belly up to the bar and drink adult beverages served by Malissa. Great service, terrible food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear?start=20

The server was apologetic and brought another one, and after 2 bites, AGAIN found a fry. Both times our server told the manager (Stan) about it because we could see them, and no one ever came to talk to us or offer any compensation for the situation. I was obviously turned off from the queso and ordered the fried cheddar bites but was charged for them :-(.

I waited to be sat which i dont mind but then waited a good five minutes or so before even being acknowledged by a server then five more minutes before our actual server arrived still with no drinks. I waited a total of fifteen minutes from the time i sat down with no drinks. From the time i sat down until the time i left, which was close to 2 hours because of absolutely how dreadfully slow the service was, all the tables in view were dirty. And stayed dirty. No wonder i have to wait ten minutes to be sat because no one knows how to table turn. And im sorry but id rather not look at peoples tables the whole time im eating.

What I found strange was the fact that the server was trying to promote unlimited games for I think 99 cents? What happened to the gold old days of having good conversations instead of being tied to technology. The water was pretty bad. We had to order an iced tea to get the taste out of our mouths and even then it wasn't great. The food was mediocre. My go to dish, the country fried steak was overcooked.

My wife and I enjoy sitting in the lounge area most of the time because of the fact you can just grab a high top table without waiting. I've been going to this location for a few years now, food always good. The problem is, even when their not busy your sitting there waiting for someone to come over as much for 5 to 10 minutes.  I've seen people get up and walk on more than one occasion for lack of service.  Where's the floor mgr of this place . The servers are friendly enough when their there but they pull more disappearing acts than Houdini.   This has been a consistent problem at this location. (bar area) They just recently did an inside and outside makeover which really looks great and chic (New York style)  really cool!! Ok""  Iam being nit picky here, but they took the high top table in the far corner And  replaced it with Handicap table, although I totally agree with the need for handicap tables , I cannot understand the placement of this one.  I've seen handicap patrons trying to maneuver through the high tops trying to get to this table.  Like an obstacle course.   Wouldn't it make more sense to locate this table to the entrance of the lounge for easier access for the handicap, for safety reasons?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear?start=20

Michael C.,"El Mirage, AZ",0,3,,1.0,5/15/2016,"this is the second time that the food and service were seriously lacking. I used to come in here a lot, but quality and service have been suffering. Three months ago I went in with my mother and aunt and it took almost an hour for the food to be delivered and when it was served it was clearly cold. The manager gave it to us for free. Today I was craving the steak and asparagus meal that is topped with shrimp. It took almost 40 minutes to get to me and the only thing hot was the skillet and the burnt asparagus. Steak was over cooked and cold. Even had a nice lady next to me say that she hoped I hadn't ordered the steak well done. Nope it was supposed to be medium rare.  Manager came by and offered 50% off meal. I told him I would pay full price and actually left him half of the meal. I figured first time was their mistake, and second time was mine. To make it worse, a couple came in 10 minutes after me and was served their third course ten minutes before I received my cold meal.  And since I was raised to give good and bad together when possible, I will say that the beer was cold, but since Applebee's is around the corner, I will try them in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear?start=40

I take my niece on our ""girls day out"" movie trips here for lunch and she enjoys it.  I usually have a grilled chicken salad and she always has a pizza, so I can't really say that I have tried what they are famous for.. since I don't eat pork, but the atmosphere is always high energy and the servers are usually pretty good and fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear?start=40
Christopher S.,"San Francisco, CA",333,12,3,1.0,7/29/2013,"Went for lunch and sat in the bar area.  The Good:  Cleanliness was good and service was above average. So far so good... The Bad:  Ordered Fajitas Trio with no beans or rice, as I have ordered countless times at other Chili's. Order came out in a timely manner.... but the food was simply terrible. My stomach churns just remembering it.  So for those who don't know, Fajitas Trio is chicken, steak and shrimp on a hot skillet with sliced onions and bell peppers.  First, the chicken came out with no grill marks, looking like a frozen breast that somebody had thrown into some hot water to cook. Zero grill marks.. I mean, can we at least PRETEND it was grilled? Isn't it supposed to sizzle like in the commercials? The chicken didn't even get grilled on the hot skillet! Which brings me to the skillet... it wasn't hot! How are you going to serve fajitas with a lukewarm skillet? Booo! Get outta here Chilis!  The onions and bell peppers looked (and tasted) like they had been pulled from the freezer too since they had no crunchiness at all.  Shrimp is obviously frozen (this is AZ after all).  The pico de gallo, guac and shredded lettuce all looked a few days past their best by date.  You know how good things are more than a sum of their parts? This was LESS than a sum... each item was bad but collectively, it was a terrible meal especially at the price point ($15!). So maybe my memory has failed and the food was always this bad, but something tells me that this was an exceptionally poor representation.  My friend ordered an appetizer sampler and said the sliders were meh (only ate one) as were the egg rolls.  Summary: low quality food, poor preparation. Don't go here, try any other restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear?start=40

Mak I.,"Florence, AZ",0,22,,3.0,9/20/2012,"Maybe this isn't my week because this is the 2nd time in as many days that I've eaten out and encountered substandard help from the staff but this time the customer to staff ratio really made it ludicrous that I'm having to point this out. I walked into this location around 3pm, aside from me there was 1 customer at the bar and 1 table I was customer # 3. Right when I walked in I went to the restroom to wash up and when I came back I found the hostess stand empty.  As I had walked back to the bathroom there was a pair of the wait staff eating in the back customer table by the bathrooms and exit, don't bother to look up and say hi or anything they just kept on doing their thing.  After leaving the restroom I passed 1 table occupied by a female manager that faced the front door, she was busy in paperwork but also oblivious to the fact that someone was standing there, waiting to be seated only 15 feet directly in front of her, not once did she look up or she would have called someone or taken care of it herself.  From the hostess stand you see directly into the bar area, 1 customer was seated at the bar, 2 employee's were sitting at the booth directly line of sight from the hostess station, they glanced over several times and made no attempt to ask if I needed something.  After 3 minutes (I know this because I was counting 30 second commercials on ESPN) the bartender finally poked her head up and asked me if I needed anything, yes I'd like to be seated and have lunch.  I won't rip her too badly because I sat in her section and she did take care of me well, to the point where I left her a 5 dollar tip, however the fact that 5 front room staff who were only taking care of 4 customers couldn't see it fit to take 10 seconds and do what they are supposed to do almost had me walking out.  The food is basic Chili's, honestly never really had a bad meal there but it's important to point out that even with a manager a few feet away and an empty restaurant, I was left hanging, almost walked out and once that happens, it will be a long time before I come back... there are too many choices in a small area and Chili's is not exactly the best of the best of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goodyear?start=60

William P.,"Montclair, CA",259,235,,4.0,11/15/2010,"In my own mind, I have something of a three-tiered system.  For restaurants that try to be top quality, that's one tier.  For sit-down chain restaurants, that's another tier.  And then for fast food restaurants, that's another tier entirely. Yesterday we ate at this Chili's; that would be a tier two kind of place.  For that tier, they have to beat Denny's.  Chili's manages that very well. Yesterday, I had this soup that was new to me, a sweet corn soup, which I found to be excellent; I followed it with their standard bacon cheeseburger, which they overcooked a bit.  Edible.  I'm not fond of their french fries, though.  I think that they taste like they'd been frozen and then fried.  Overall, for me it was a good experience. OTOH, my wife wasn't at all happy with her sandwich which consisted of steak in a pita roll; her meat was burned.

Only 3 of us. 2 adults 1 preteen and he's very hungry boy who loves Chili's and knows exactly what he wants. The waiter was thought he know better what we should have and not in a helpful way. Our boy ordered his usual hot wings and when we asked if he wanted anything else the waiter butted in and said ""Oh, you'll have plenty to eat"" Well, he's old enough to know how much he can eat with no help from the staff. Then he told us we needed cocktails. Uh, no we wanted sodas/tea. He never noticed we only had 2 place settings even when we finally got our appetizer (messy) so we shared forks and napkins. I walked around trying to find some sugar for my iced tea and after I asked for some it was awhile until I got it. We then sat and watched 3 new tables order and get their meal while we waited. It seriously wasn't anymore busy for our waiter then the others. We finally received our meal and the waiter was surprised we asked if our son could have some silverware/napkins with his meal. it barely made it on our table as he flew past with it. Our drinks were empty before we got our meal (HUGE deal for me) but we eventually got refills. When done our son wanted his usual cheesecake. We had to nearly beg the waiter to let us order him dessert (he's 12) and then he was made to feel bad when the waiter just couldn't believe he didn't want the hot pan cookie/icream thing. He's had the darn thing before!  Then as we watched more tables come and go we finally got our check THEN waited for the guy to take the money. I had to actually make it super visible since he didn't get the hint when the tray sat at the edge of the table forever. Then he came over complaining about ""Women""! and something about seeing the movie ""The Hobbit"" as he then went on to tell us he owed us $.70  Hello, I'm a woman and I want to see the movie!  I would have paid $7.70 to get the heck out of there.  Went in the bathroom and toilets were unflushed and the silk flowers had long term dust on them.
