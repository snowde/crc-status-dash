D N.,"Saint Marys, OH",0,11,20,5.0,12/27/2017,"Food food oh wonderful food. The menu was filled with wonderful choices. I was out of town for four days for work and and CHOSE to eat here every night, we had a variety of different items. Everything was fantastic. Way to go Chili's. You are back on top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Linda H.,"South Haven, MI",8,90,186,3.0,1/1/2018,"Hubby had the old timer and said it was good. I ordered the lunch combo of potatoes soup & two hamburger sliders ""Big Bites"". Soup came cold, the waiter did reheat butttttt The sliders looked good but there wasn't really any taste.  They were supposed to have a ranch dressing on them but they didn't. We hadn't been to Chili's in a while & it will be another while before we go back. Restrooms weren't real clean either :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Alison R.,"Greensburg, IN",12,3,18,1.0,7/31/2017,"We had an hour for dinner on a Monday night. The restaurant was mostly empty.  To the point: it was not a great place to dine. It was a poor experience. Tepid food, congealed cheese on cold fries for an appetizer, grilled (I think) sliced chicken with a splash of red spice on some of it as ""fajitas.""  Kids meals way over priced for value. Service slow. Nothing was really very hot, or appetizing. We left the majority of it uneaten...and for what was served, WAY expensive... especially since we were overcharged.   My family eats at restaurants several times a week...I really doubt we ever return to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Anita M.,"Greensburg, IN",31,51,11,4.0,7/9/2017,"We frequent this Chili's. The food is cooked to order, friendly service, and fairly quick. We also order to go from here which is very convenient with their app. It's ready in typically 20 minutes. Only once did we have an issue and that was just I felt there should have been more guacamole on my burger. :).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Britney B.,"Shelbyville, IN",0,22,1,5.0,9/10/2017,"Amazing service. We went today, Sunday, for lunch. Our food came out quick and we had a great waitress. She was kind and polite. She was on top of everything, which isn't always easy because I am specific with my sandwiches. I recommend asking for the waitress named Danielle. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Rick G.,"Indianapolis, IN",316,413,41,4.0,11/26/2014,"Once again, in my eyes, Chili's raises the bar for chain restaurants in my eyes.  We were passing through at dinner time, on the way to Cincy, and wanted more than fast food, so stopped in at Chili's. I had one of their burgers, and I believe Chili's has outstanding burgers.  Done just like I requested, a very good burger indeed.  My wife and a soup an salad combo and it was good also. The service was good, even though it was HOPPING at 530 on a Friday. I seldom stop at chain restaurants when I'm on the road.  When I do, it's a Chili's because they've earned my repeat business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Andrew W.,"Columbus, IN",2,3,1,1.0,4/14/2016,"Been here twice this week.both times waited forever. Finally got served to have to argue with the waitress about what I wanted to order. Last time I check customer is always right. I'll drive to Columbus Chili's before I come back to this one. Management is poor, service needs much work and training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Tyrone B.,"Indianapolis, IN",4,45,16,5.0,8/23/2015,The food here was great. The server name Kristin was excellent. She made our dining experience a good one. If you ever come to this chilis definitely try to get Kristin as your server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Chris R.,"Memphis, TN",0,12,1,5.0,11/26/2015,"Perfect for biz dining and sitting at the bar. Nice bar, 3 TV's, decent assortment of beer & booze. I had grilled fish one night and a burger the other.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Kasey B.,"Greensburg, IN",1,19,5,5.0,12/17/2015,I love eating here! Never had a bad meal. Always have had good service. The newer menu is awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Frank E.,"Fishers, IN",0,13,,4.0,6/18/2016,"This is one of the few chain restaurants we in. The reason we like this one ? It's not run like a corporate chain. The servers, especially Traci, are all great. They make you feel like family. The manager hires great people and retains them because he lets them do what they are good at. You can feel how much they all care. The food is never over done. The service is quick and the prices fair. Great house wine ... Really intelligent choices for quality and value. We are regulars and will be so for years. Great place !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Jen N.,"South Bend, IN",36,58,7,4.0,7/10/2011,"I generally avoid chain restaurants, but I was driving to Cincinnati and needed to stop somewhere for lunch. Chili's sounded better than Burger King, so I stopped there.  I was pleasantly surprised by their menu. They have lunchtime combo options for $6, $7, and $8, depending on what you want. I got a southwest BLT sandwich with chicken tortilla soup and a side of coleslaw (instead of the fries that generally come with it.) All of that for $6. And it was all tasty. There were several other menu items that sounded tempting, too.  It was the birthday of one of my friends, and when we mentioned it she got a free brownie covered with ice cream and fudge sauce. (Delicious!) It wasn't a good time for alcohol on my trip, but I glanced at the drink menu and there were several that looked really tasty. Our server was really good, too.  If you like chain restaurants, or if you are looking for a place to stop on a road trip, based on this experience I would recommend Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Emily B.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",31,65,9,5.0,4/11/2013,"I'm from LA, and I love this small Chili's. The staff was nice and friendly on the busy Wednesday night. I sat in the bar with my father and uncle to catch up on good times. My uncle and I came to town for the funeral of my grandpa. We sat and chat forever, and the waitress, Ashleigh, was very nice and allowed us to take up the table for 2 hours. I had wings and Sam Adams, such a good combo, while my family had the happy hour drinks. My wings and beer were even on the happy hour menu. Overall, because of my unfortunate family get together, Chili's provided a great place to catch up with family I have not seen in years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
Ashok G.,"Chatham Township, NJ",10,71,52,3.0,2/12/2013,Hung out with my friend after several yrs. Location is mapped incorrectly and i almost got lost until i realized i am driving nowhere. Love their chocolate lava cake. Staff was not polite and food was just OK.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
David K.,"Urbana, IL",0,28,,4.0,11/15/2012,"It's a Chili's.  What more needs to be said?  Unless you've never been to a Chili's, I guess.  The food was a good, although the waitress we had was sub-par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2
