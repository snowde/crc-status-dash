Ljubica T.,"Calgary, Canada",46,81,6,1.0,5/14/2013,"Typical chain restaurant located in a relatively nice hotel (what a shame). We had the breakfast buffet, which was included in our hotel stay at The Fox. Everything here is serve yourself, basically: Liquid pancake mix that results in puffy, non-filling pancakes. Flavoured yogurt (who knows what is in it) with a selection of mediocre, tasteless fruit. Fake syrup (This is Banff, people... at least serve REAL Maple Syrup!) for your unappetizing pancakes. Burnt coffee. Just nasty, nasty, nasty. I wish The Fox had a nice locally owned place attached to their hotel instead of a chain restaurant like Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff?start=20
Peggy G.,"Kelowna, Canada",1,51,1,3.0,12/29/2012,Ok. Fine as far as chain restaurants go. Serving staff was good. Time for everything was quick. I hate eating at chains but kids were starving.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff?start=20
Dylan W.,"Fort McMurray, Canada",1,9,6,1.0,11/9/2014,"Had the ""Philly cheese steak"". Nasty, covered in 7/11 nacho sauce and gross rubbery meat. Fries were cooked properly but were so over salted they made my lips sting. Kids pizza that my son had was pretty gross. Just a soft pita covered in cheap sauce and cheese. He didn't finish which is abnormal for him. Girlfriend did not care for her nachos. They did not charge for the philly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff?start=20
Yolanda Y.,"San Francisco, CA",74,632,143,3.0,8/4/2012,"We ended up here because we were extremely hungry, it was kind of late, and this was the only familiar looking place.  The service was alright, but the food was unremarkable at best.  My bloody mary had a hair in it which was a total bummer because I didn't want to touch the drink after that.  Usually I get fajitas at these kinds of places and the ones here were just alright.  When we were here the beer taps weren't working either.  To access the restrooms you have to take a couple flights of stairs down back into the hotel to which the restaurant is connected.  There's a good amount of outdoor seating and it seems they can heat the area when its cold so that's a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff?start=20
David S.,"Edinboro, PA",0,4,,4.0,7/30/2014,I don't understand the negative reviews. The menu wasn't exactly  the same as back in the states but it was still excellent food and drinks. My waitress Marie was top notch,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff?start=20
Klaus J.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,134,,1.0,9/30/2012,"My first time at Chili's. I decided to go with fajitas, as there is no way they could go wrong with this. I was mistaken. There was absolutely no taste in the fajitas, what so ever. The food was not even mediocre, but BAD. I was very dissapointed, despite the waitress was nice and polite. I would most definitely NOT recommend this place to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff?start=20
Erin H.,"Saint Albert, Canada",39,158,289,4.0,12/3/2017,My review is limited to my experience but so far so good!! My favourite part of the whole experience though is getting to still walk into one of these franchises. With almost all of them shutting down in our area of the country I can't help but feel it's very exclusive bows and more exciting.  When staying at the Fox Hotel you get vouchers for breakfast so I have been able to enjoy the atmosphere for several mornings and am loving it!! The wait staff is amazing and the food is sure a nice bonus for the hungry travellers. My favourite is the bacon  you can order on the side and makes it easier to leave a tip too .  With a huge selection shown in pictures you can no doubt find something for everyone. I filled my belly and people watched the waffle maker... always good for a laugh to those who forget to use the spray.  One point for those with mobility issues though....stairs everywhere!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Emily B.,"Southeast Edmonton, Edmonton, Canada",2,29,9,2.0,9/25/2017,"Downward spiral of cheapness anyone?  I have frequently stayed at the Fox hotel adjoined to this chilis for about the past 7 years, and this chilis has obviously changed hands or managers since my last visit.  This chilis provides the breakfast spread for those staying at the fox, it used to entail a great selection of fresh fruits, now just melon and 3 or 5 grapes if you are lucky. There were no longer apples or oranges available for those that don't want to eat processed foods. Used to have soy milk available and butter OR margarine for those of us that do not wish to slaughter day old calves for our breakfast. Now they provide neither.  They now offer almond milk at an additional charge of $2.75 which is more than I have ever seen, anywhere.  Considering soy and almond costs no more than cattle nipple secretions I am pretty shell shocked to see people being charged an arm and a leg to opt not to harm the planet.  Oh, and don't bother trying to seek out a butter alternative anymore, they simply don't have it.  I won't be brining my business retreats back to this place, and unfortunately the fox has lost my business by proxy due to their inability to ensure that vegans and vegetarians are not forced to consume butter or eat dry toast without, or price gouged if they don't want to suckle on a cow nipple.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Stephanie W.,"Madison, WI",28,182,41,4.0,8/2/2017,"I am usually not a fan of this chain but it was the closest place to where we were staying in town and our choice after a long day of hiking and not wanting to look for any other options. We were positively surprised by the friendliness of the staff and the great food. We had the chicken tacos and salmon, which were amazing. We even got a free dessert since we had to wait for a while for our food. Which was another bonus. Indeed it was so good we went the next day and the waiter and hostess even improve our seating when they saw us again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Elizabeth W.,"Oak Park, Australia",0,4,2,4.0,12/12/2017,Friendly and efficient service; we enjoyed our meals- the burger and ribs were delicious. Great cocktails.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff

Ben S.,"Banff, Canada",11,11,,5.0,12/3/2017,"I have only been to Chili's a few times before, that being back in Edmonton at the airport where the experience was average. However, here in Banff, my girlfriend and I had a lovely experience. The food was great, I had one of the greatest burgers that I have ever had. On top of the excellent food, our waiter was so kind and easy to talk to. We were thrilled with our experience and decided to come back the following night. Once again, great food, great service, very nice restaurant! Highly recommend to anyone coming to Banff thats looking for a good meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Heather H.,"Winnipeg, Canada",0,8,,5.0,9/27/2017,We have always liked Chili's but hadn't been for awhile as not available in our home town. We always try to go there when we are in Banff. Had the Smothered Smoked Chicken Burrito.  It was extremely good...I will be going back to have it again before we head home!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Diane C.,"Hurst, TX",13,66,,4.0,9/5/2017,Good food. Excellent service. Offers many of the Chili's items. Had the taco special and it was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Finn R.,"Wauchope, Australia",10,22,31,4.0,10/28/2016,Quite tasty! My burger was delicious and everyone at my table enjoyed their food as well. The servers were very amiable!

James W.,"West Hollywood, CA",2664,1908,8067,3.0,8/16/2014,"Great portions, but lackluster flavors and quite pricy. Located in the Fox Hotel, where I stayed figured this was an easy option. It's your standard Chili's menu. I tried the full rack of ribs as well as their chicken tacos. Both were a bit salty. I though the ribs needed to fall off the bone slightly more easily. Cost was about $30 Canadian a person.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Ira B.,"Salisbury, United Kingdom",45,345,903,5.0,3/25/2014,"A good Chilis franchise serving tasty, hot and freshly prepared texmex food. George and Mo really looked after us and the service was attentive and discreet. The quesadilla was outstanding and I can highly recommend the pico de gallo. My buddy had the Fajita Trio and it disappeared in no time. Loads better than the Magpie & Stump and one of our top 5 meal experiences in Banff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
joel h.,"Long Beach, CA",4,34,,1.0,2/7/2015,"Before selecting this Chili's I did an internet search on the Banff Chilis and found the menu and prices to be very fair only to discover that THIS Chilis is privately owned and not part of the chain. We found the food to be mediocre and the prices ridiculously high as are most of the Banff restaurants.  The worst part though of the dining experience was the noise.  So incredibly loud.  We were seated near a couple with a screaming kid, and the restaurant did nothing to provide relief.  If I was the manager I would have asked them to take their food home along with their screaming kid.  Not fair for the kid though.  People should have brains enough not to take a kid out to dinner at a nice restaurant at 10:00 pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Anne K.,"Fernie, Canada",51,57,8,5.0,3/31/2014,"Many thanks to Chili's for accommodating a dozen of us on a weekend at the last minute!  We had a delightful server, who did things like bring multiple debit machines to the table to help us settle up. Chili's has two sizes of wine, including a 9oz glass, which was fantastic for our group lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Chelle A.,"Winnipeg, Canada",3,11,1,1.0,7/9/2012,"Stopped in here for dinner. If your expecting the same chili's experience as you would in USA don't come!! More on the expensive side. Caesar (drink) was not very good. However Philly Cheese Streak was good. Stay away from the mashed potatoes & gravy - tasted like frozen instant potatoes. If your going to get the fajitas, extra wraps (you get 4 small ones) are additional $. The plate of ""cheese, lettuce & pico de gallo"" is small and not enough.  Doubt I'd would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Sherry L.,"Houston, TX",5,24,1,4.0,2/13/2013,"Boyfriend and I were starving and saw the Chili's as we were driving towards our lodge for the weekend. I am a big fan of Chili's, and we decided we had to go. We arrived, were seated promptly (it was about 8 pm). Our waiter, Greg, was absolutely charming and great. He was attentive, even when he had to start taking care of a rowdy 18-top in the back. Our food came out exactly as we ordered, and we enjoyed everything!  I made a note to save the receipt to properly write a review of the food and Greg's service, but the receipt didn't make it back to the US with me. However, Greg definitely made the evening, 5 stars to him!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Charles Y.,"Berkeley, CA",142,277,6,4.0,6/24/2015,pretty good chilis they also have chilis in america and I think in Europe too and also u can get good chili in a can at safeway and make chili soup or if u put it with cheese and a hot dog u can make a chili cheese dog or chili cheese fries,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Irena G.,"Division No.  6, Canada",7,3,,5.0,3/30/2014,"We were a group of twelve ladies on a stagette weekend, and this restaurant really stepped it up on a very short moments notice to accomodate us.

Brian B.,"Abbotsford, Canada",5,108,76,2.0,6/9/2011,"Being a big Chilli's fan south of the border, I had certain expectations. I have to say this was not the same experience I was accustomed to at previous Chili's I've frequented as this one in Banff. I do have to say the restaurant was very nice atmosphere and well laid out with a nice upstairs, and it was also very clean. The restaurant was empty at dinner time, this was a bit of a concern for such a popular place from my previous experiences. We were helped quickly and got a great table. The waitress we got was so over top friendly it was fake and I don't think she even realized it. I've never been called love before so many times in one sentence. Just be real and genuine and you will get a good tip.... Our order was correct and looked like the picture too, but that was about all that was good. The flavour of my sandwich was non existant and was little meat and a very hard bun.  My GF had an interesting salad that looked really good and was a decent size and was unique. She felt it was ok not great, as she was starving and it still had ok taste. We also started with the deep fried pickles which were actually very tasty and different from previous I've had, however the basket had 1/2"" of grease at the bottom with the last dozen slices never getting finished. The prices were not what I was accustomed to in the US, and seemed a bit expensive for this franchise. Well I have to say I won't be back to this Chili's....many better options in Banff for the prices....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
Armand R.,"Sundre, Canada",8,33,7,1.0,3/29/2014,"This restaurant   is terrible. The drinks are completely over priced and so as most of the food. The wait time was to long and my food came in VERY small portions. I ordered fajitas and there was barley and meat mostly vegetables, don't recommend this place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-banff
