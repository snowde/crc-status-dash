Nina S.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",30,44,54,4.0,1/30/2011,"I would consider Chili's a cornerstone for a wonderful family dining experience in the GTA.  The restaurant architecture is a stand-out and interior is delightfully fresh, cozy and nostalgic.  The warm hospitality and the neighbourly familiarity and candor make us feel very welcome and comfortable.  Everything is clean and well-maintained that even a trip to the washroom is something I enjoy. My husband and I bring our kids here on those special weekends when a huge craving for something American or Tex-Mex hits.  Our usual appetizers would be the ""Bottomless Tostada Chips"" (how could it not be?) with salsa or the ""Hot Spinach and Antichoke Dip"" with tostada chips or the loaded ""Classic Nachos.""  The ""Southwestern Eggrolls"" has a good kick in flavour and texture with a little zing on the after taste.  We usually go right on with the main course and our usual orders would be the huge and my-last-meal-on-earth sandwiches (ranges $9.49-11.99) like Chili's Cheesesteak, Jalapeno Smokehouse (applewood smoked extra thick) Bacon Big Mouth Burger, and Southern Smokehouse (sugar & chilli and extra thick) Bacon Big Mouth Burger that include a siding of either black beans with a bit of salsa, or fries, etc.  Will never be underestimated.  Deliciously satisfying. Their Big Mouth Bites, mini burgers but not short on flavour and served with friend onion rings, is good but the kids don't like it probably because of the sautéed onions in it.  Oldtimer burger was gastronomically tempting but after a couple of orders we put a thumbs down on this one.  Its like a muscle car with a bad engine.  Disappointingly or surprisingly flavourless. Their kids menu has so many options that the occasional picky-eater in them are thrown out the door.  Quesadillas, Chicken Crispers, Grilled Chicken or Cheese sandwiches are some of the sure hit items for the kids.  Sidings has a longer list that include vegetables.  My kids would have a nice exercise on decision-making while containing their appetite. They also serve Ribs, Fajitas, Steaks; Classic grilled chicken dishes; Grilled Seafood.  I am yet to try one of those so for now I have no comment.  Though The Keg's steaks and Baton Rouge's grilled chicken are juicy and wonderfully seasoned, that is, assuming you're asking my recommendations. Very seldom do we have enough room for dessert but when we do get a tad space in the belly we would share on Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie.  Sooo good and satisfying but, trust me, you would really want to share this and with more than one person.  The One Brownie Sweet Shot is a smaller serving dessert with vanilla ice cream and a small slice of brownie fudge.  Smooth and creamy and is a nice finish.  I would really suggest a wider mouth serving dish for this one. A sports bar at the other side of the room can be a nice place to chill out with friends serving premium magaritas and cocktails.  Dinner dates are common here, too, with couples sitting at the booths by the shutter windows.  But mostly, family groups fill this place with vigor. Its truly an enjoyable place and the service and food are buzzworthy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2?start=20
Lauren M.,"Thornhill, Canada",0,6,,3.0,9/1/2013,"The restaurant was OK. Our food was alright and the servers were *VERY* attentive (I say very because it was a bit off-puting when the waitress runs away with a huge smile on her face and asked us three times if we need anything and how our food is..in addition to the manager coming around to ask us if we need anything. We began to question if the restaurant was in trouble.) Overall, the food is what you expect from a chain restaurant--nothing to write home about. It's worth the visit but I'm not sure we will be back. With all the options in Toronto, I hardly ever return a restaurant unless it really knocks my socks off!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2?start=20
Craig B.,"Vaughan, Canada",0,13,13,2.0,3/26/2014,"Went here with my parents a few weeks ago, food was cold when served, had to ask over and over again for cutlery. Manager of this place is completely fake, needs to learn to tell servers when they have screwed up so that there is no confusion on what needs to be done. I've gone here before and had a positive experience but my last experience will certainly make me not want to return to this restaurant. Will probably go to Jack Astor's next time I am in this area and looking for something to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2?start=20
Christine R.,"Scarborough, Canada",170,230,1644,2.0,5/27/2011,"I am a HUGEEEE fan of the Chili's in Buffalo. And when I found out that made one closer to home I was over the moon!  However after my experience tonight I realize that my high hopes were just in fact hopes.....and that this Canadian version was a stark contrast of the my American experience. Let me explain...... We were seated promptly which was surprising because it was packed in here on this rainy friday night. The crowd mostly consisted of teenagers and young adults. It was rather noisy with faint music which cut on and off through out the night and a smoky atmosphere. (My coat still smells of that musty smoke) Our waitress seemed rather jittery (perhaps she was new?) after delivering our menu she came back a mere 2 minutes later to see if we were ready to place our order. Only 1 out of the 4 us had actually opened the menu at this point in time. She then took our drink orders. 4 waters one with no ice.....we instead got 4 waters with no ice Entrees: Jalepeno Smokehouse burger with fries and gravy - This by far the best entree ordered and received at the table. Nice big juicy burger, ample topping, nice portion of there white gravy. No complaints here Half rack of ribs with mashed potatoes and gravy and broccoli - worst ribs ever....hard...litterally had to scrape the meat off the bones...broccoli...meh just plain and steamed....mash w/gravy...best thing on the plate...delish Top Sirloin (medium) with mashed potatoes and gravy and sauteed veg - steak was cooked medium but rather small portion compared to your typical 8oz steaks....small portion of sauteed veg consisting merely of mushroom, green peppers and onions...again potatoes were the best part of the meal Then my meal..... Top sirloin (rare) with broccoli and mashed potatoes and gravy - my steak looked nothing like friend's steak.......did not even look like a top sirloin......taste horrendous....cooked medium rare? ooo and loaded potatoes not my mash n gravy?? i try and track down the server and point out my steak looks nothing like friends steak whom ordered the same as me and i got the wrong potatoes...she apologizes and says she rush out another one stat!.......everyone finishes there meal and i finally get mine......she says the reason my steak looked different before was because the pounded out my steak????POUNDED OUT MY STEAK???? Who does that?? ANywhoooo she brings out my steak.......and looks exactly the one she gave me before...again not resembling a top sirloin looking more like a strip....i am speechless...at the potatoes are correct....i taste the steak....even more terrible than last time...tastes like pork...i let my tablemates sample to make sure i'm not crazy....and they agree!! Anyways i only eat the mash. Waiter returns and apologizes again and says she'll send out the manager to speak with me. I tell the manager this is the worst steak i've ever tasted it taste more like pork...he justifies the taste by saying because there steaks are soo fresh and not aged....Whatever...but he offers to bring me anything else off the menu free of charge i am totally turned off of steak and just want the chocolate chip paradise pie which was pictured on the menu looking so dreamy and delicious. He says ok we'll get you one right away.... maybe like 20 minutes the pie comes out.....looking nothing like the picture totally lack lustre and bland tasting. Come here only for the burgers and sandwiches and the great mashed potatoes and white gravy...otherwise save your chili's adventures for when your in America!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2?start=20
Tia B.,"North York, Canada",55,126,172,3.0,11/23/2011,"It was my first time at Chili's and I had high expectations. I guess the bar was raised too high or I just picked the wrong menu item? I had the guilt free buffalo chicken sandwich- it was Luke warm like they microwaved it and there was no flavor at all in it. My friend ordered the Texan jalapeño fries or something like that- he said it was alright but that the dip was the best part...I must agree. Again probably just the wrong menu items although the other review have me doubting that as well. However.. (drum roll please..) their salsa which they make from scratch I found rather tasty! Thus, earning 3 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2?start=20

David H.,"Mississauga, Canada",30,83,,3.0,7/27/2012,"Chili's is pretty good as far as those apostrophe chain restaurants go (i.e. Montana's, Kelsey's, Casey's, Jack Astor's, Turtle Jack's.....). Of the times I've eaten here I like their burgers the best.  The jalapeno burger is my personal favourite.  Also the deconstructed ice cream bar is a great dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2?start=20
Adriano A.,"Toronto, Canada",7,36,9,2.0,3/10/2010,"I really enjoyed Chili's when I visited it in New Jersey, so imagine my excitement when it's announced that a Chili's is opening a mere 20 minutes away from home. No more pulling out my passport just for some fajitas.  However, like most things that cross the border up to the Great White North, it just didn't feel the same. The moment we walked in, we were warned that the wait would be long. ""Long"", as I was told when I asked what that meant, was supposed to be around a half-hour. Definitely long, but reasonable considering it was around 6pm and dinner service was sure to ramp up. My girlfriend and I stood there, as there isn't really anywhere to sit when you're forced to wait inside the doorway as not to get in the way of people walking to and fro in front of you. About an hour later, we were finally seated.  I don't know why I waited that long for a table with all the other options so nearby, but we did. We were determined to simulate the great experience we had in Jersey as best as possible. The good news was, we were right next to the kitchen. No excuse to miss us. They did. A bunch of times. We sat there for about another half-hour before someone finally came and asked us what drinks we wanted. Having all the time to review the menu much too thoroughly, we decided to order our entrees as well. I got the fajitas, as I would State-side, and I have to say that they were pretty good. Just not good enough to wait the extra 45 minutes it took for the meal to get to us.  At 9pm, we finally got the bill and got the hell out of the packed Chili's. What was supposed to be a quick meal ended up being a three hour test of our patience. Good for them, I'm a sucker for branding and I waited through that mess.  I hope the service improves because the food is actually quite good, but if I can get to a Chili's in New Jersey before I'm seated in Vaughan, it's definitely not worth visiting this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2?start=20
Jay G.,"Toronto, Canada",163,164,20,3.0,9/13/2009,"There is finally a Chili's in the Toronto area! Chili's brings back a lot of great childhood memories for me and this Chili's had all the new digs with a touch of the old stuff that made it fun. Ever see those Chili's commercials where the hostess opens the doors and says ""Hi, welcome to Chili's!"" in a super friendly way? Well that is exactly the way I was greeted coming here. I was a little taken aback by how much the hostess resembled the girl in the commercial. Then another hostess opened the second set of doors smiling happily saying hello. Then at the podium we were greeted by the third hostess who was to show us to our seats. I though it was a bit of overkill to have so many hostesses but I did like how welcoming it was and how I didn't have to open the door. Walking in I was surrounded by the familiar sights and smells of Chili's. Random things on the walls, sizzling fajitas, sports on TV, red and yellow almost everywhere, and a bad ass margarita bar. This margarita bar, although a regular bar, looks cooler than most bars seen at chain restaurants because of the addition of a giant blue neon sign. Just the sight of this sign alone makes you want a margarita. I sat in the bar area since the dining room was full and extremely busy. I thought the service would be lacking since it was packed inside and because we were in the bar area but the service was as on top of their game as the hostesses opening the doors. Service was literally full of smiles; our waitress had a permanent smile on her face and seemed extremely happy to be here. She seemed genuinely happy to be there and genuinely friendly but having everyone else in the establishment act the same made it almost surreal. I thought to myself that they must have an awesome training program. The food was good. It's your typical American chain restaurant choices with monster salads, sandwiches, burgers, steaks, ribs, and fajitas. The menu is absolutely monstrous! I had a very hard time deciding what I wanted because it all sounded good and there were plenty of pictures to boot so every turn of the page would change your mind.  I had a turkey club. It tasted great but was soggy from the amount butter smeared on the slices of toasted bread. I didn't even realize there was a piece of bread in the middle until half way through because it became soaking wet and molded with the turkey. The fries were not the same that I remember as a kid growing up in Texas. Although they had that great seasoning to them they weren't crispy at all and seemed a little under done. The place is new and they are probably still training their kitchen staff, so I can let it slide for now. Overall, this is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants because they have great margaritas, tasty food, and the place reminds me of my childhood. The service is great if you can stand it and the prices are reasonable. The food needs work though, the taste is there but the execution is poor. Maybe with more time they'll iron out the kinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2?start=20

She was ok with taking our orders right and bringing our drinks on time.The only thing was that for an american restaurant it was quite dissapointing...the portions were not ""american-sized"" and their take on south of the border meals was not authentic..or even close...I had nachos and i won't go   friend had fajitas and they were the same as you'd get at kelseys and jack astors...so u pay $20 for fajitas and all these places are all the same.

NO it doesn't for those chefs out there that know what I'm talking about. on top of that, the boss not only didn't apologize or offer a discount, he made it seem like it was our fault to begin with by ordering penne pasta. he said this exact sentence ""just letting you guys know penne pasta originally has a cheese base. just be careful what you order.""

Kris U.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",2917,1220,3534,4.0,10/24/2012,"Last night the Savour York Region Restaurant week brought a cast of yelpers out to Chili's for a taste of Tex-Mex at an incredible price. The promotional menu offered us our choice of Appetizer, Main and Dessert for the very appetizing price of $25/ person! More on the food in moments... The weather may have kept some of the regulars at bay BUT...Sitting at the bar last night with my friends we were treated to an amazing, educational experience by Chili's Owner Heath. As I ordered a round of Presidente Margaritas (their premium Margarita) for my friends Heath began to give us a Tequila 101 session. Speaking the varying grades and types of Tequila. Explaining how the taste of tequila changes from the lower grade stuff used in a tequila popper up to the premium grade tequila used in their margaritas. Then came the best part...the taste. Being a summer margarita fella, these really impressed the pants off of me. Not overly limey, smooth finish, and without the harsh shudder of tequila. Heath was right! A better Tequila (Casadores - Reposado) DOES make a better Margarita. I can honestly say this was the first time I've ever enjoyed sipping on ANY drink that had tequila as an ingredient. And at $8.99??? Bargain!!! The real treat was when bartender Robin and Heath saw how much we enjoyed our Presidente's, they offered to let us try the Platinum Presidente's (we shared to get the taste). Similar in taste to the regular one but with even less notes of the tequila and an even smoother flavour - officially SOLD me on the stuff! After our education in tequila we got our dinner on. Canchi (Billy) and I shared the Cheesy Poppers and the Eqq Rolls. Cheesy poppers were freshly made and the cheese inside was gooey and had a nice kick from the Jalapenos. The Egg rolls were great and I loved the black beans inside of it :) For my main I decided to pass on the ribs as I had them the last time I was in and went for the Beef Fajitas. While it was fairly standard Fajita fare what set it apart for me was the tenderness of the beef. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and so tender I could cut it with a fork. Awesome!  We concluded our dinner with Desert - I opted for the Chocolate motlen cake which proved to be more than I could handle. Tasty, Chocolatey and a nice scoop of ice cream on top tipped in chocolate. Chili's has impressed me and is my new guilty pleasure in Vaughan. I'll be there using their free wifi more often and maybe taking advantage of more President's Margaritas during Happy Hours!

Ehsan F.,"Toronto, Canada",90,217,265,3.0,5/25/2013,"The first visit to Chili's north of the border has left me unimpressed to say the least. To be fair, I was never fond of my American visits either. I only remember them as being quick pit-stops on the I-5. The food is extremely bland, which is ironic given their name. Forget Mexican food, they give Tex-Mex a bad name. So atleast I can commend them for being consistently mediocre as a franchise.  My Philly cheese steak had this odd looking brown cheese sauce which reeked of processed cheese smell. The fries were incredibly starchy despite looking so good. Other members of our party were equally disappointed with their Tacos. I was also annoyed by the pint of Rolling Rock I was served. In addition to being poured with a very large head, I noticed it being distinctly flat and unusual in taste (I've had this beer many times in the past).  I feel like the food deserves no better than a 2. However, I do feel obliged to factor in the attentive and courteous service as well as the friendly visits to our table by the owner. It is also worth mentioning that they run a pretty clean joint unlike some of their American counterparts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2
Jim B.,"Vaughan, Canada",44,653,411,2.0,1/1/2013,"I've visited Chili's in the good old U.S. of A., so I was excited to see that the chain was pushing into Canada. After dining here.....I'm not that excited anymore. Let me preface this by stating that I haven't dined here in about a year, as my last experience was so disappointing that I swore I would never go back. Our group of 4 all remember the last time as a deal killer. On our last visit the place was a jumpin'. We had a nominal wait for a table and while waiting we thought to ourselves...""This is great....a busy restaurant is usually a sign of good food""  Wrong. The waiter was awful. His approach was off putting from the get go (he had someone trailing him so I would assume he was training someone??). Wrong person to do so. His was very robotic/unfriendly and didn't seem to really like working there. He commented to the person with him how he couldn't wait to get out of there. After tasting the food, I now understand what he was taking about. Anyways, we asked a question about a menu item and the sigh that came from the guy was audible to Vancouver.... Once we ordered, the food took forever to come out. When it did, it was not HOT, it was lukewarm. It also tasted like cardboard...absolutely no flavour considering the place is called Chilis. We did not complain to our waiter due to his already foul mood and besides, once our food was in front of us we never saw him again except when we flagged him down to get our bill. We did not finish our meals (a good waiter would have picked up on the fact that 4 people left half their meals on their plates and would ask.....but not ours). We paid our bill (which was pricey considering the quality of what we got). Sorry if I can't be more specific about what we ordered, etc....but it has been a while since I've been here. The whole experience was not pleasant at all and that is what we remember the most.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2
Victoria C.,"Brampton, Canada",57,40,79,4.0,1/18/2014,"After hearing 45 minute wait at a restaurant next door I opened my yelp app to see where we could get a table on a Friday night. Chilis seemed to be a less frequented option and the check in offer for chips and salsa lured us in.  The food is good, service is good. Not great but you can't expect to get 5 star food at a tex-mex place in Woodbridge.  I enjoyed my chicken fajitas. The Texas-sized option is great for sharing, also liked that we each got our own plate of toppings. We were served 6 warm tortillas and had our waiter offer a refill. I do appreciate food not going to waste so kudos to Chilis for that as well.  I wouldn't hesitate to stop by again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2

Jessie G.,"North York, Canada",7,11,,1.0,7/7/2013,"One review is generous for this place. That said, our waitress was very attentive and did her job. And as other commenters have noted, this location has nothing on the ones in the US. Came here last weekend because the bf knew my obsession with just about anything Tex-Mex.  I love fajitas. At Chili's there were two options. The 18.99$ classic with a choice of chicken or beef, or 22.99$ mushroom fajitas, which came with a mushroom base. Being a pescatarian, I was told that I could have an all-shrimp classic fajita, but at the 22.99$ price. I opted to add guacamole for an additional 2.49$ and a side of mushrooms for 2.29$. My 22.99$ fajitas came with three pieces of lukewarm tortillas, exactly six pieces of shrimps, an overwhelmingly large amount of onions and green peppers. The guacamole was not only bland but also tasted of unripe avocados. However, the *STAR* of my meal was the mushrooms. They were so thinly sliced that they resembled the canned variety. Our suspicion  was confirmed when my bf picked up some with his spoon, the liquid was not only runny but also TASTED like it came from a can. On the bright hand side, my bf's burger was good, but the fries were lukewarm and undercooked. However, the best part of our night was right before we left, the hostess was nice enough to inquire about our night. When she heard about our experience, she offered to call a manager. I told the manager, Patricia, that not only was I unhappy about paying 30$ for such an underwhelming meal, and that Jackastors not only had a better but cheaper version, her response was ""WELL, first of all, we are NOT Jackastors, Ok? We make our food very differently, I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your food."" What I hate the most is that she blatantly lied to me about the mushrooms, saying that it was freshly cut, and definitely not from a can. Where else could the disgusting liquid come from? We made the unfortunate mistake of wasting 70$. Don't do the same!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2
Cass L.,"Toronto, Canada",81,37,137,2.0,1/24/2014,"Firstly! Who ever constructed this building built it backwards. The entrance of this tex-mex restaurant faces the opposite way of the parking, unlike the other stores and food chains located at this plaza. It is blistering cold in this Canadian weather and to take a 2-3 minute walk in the cold at -30 degrees is extremely brutal.  When we came in the restaurant was completely empty with maybe about 3-4 other tables occupied in this very big restaurant. We had to stand at the front for about a minute or two before the server came to seat us down. Which I thought was a long time for a place that was fairly empty.  As I was looking at the menu my friends and I noticed that there was a promotion for a free app by just liking their FB page. However when we brought this up to the server he told us that we had to print it out and bring it back our next visit - pretty disappointing. After this I went on my Yelp app to sign in and to my surprise I got a free coupon for salsa and chips. When I brought this up to the server he was shocked and wasn't sure what was going on.. so he went to his manager. The manager then came over to us and brought us our salsa and chips. He seemed very nice and told us that because he's in charge of the ads on Yelp he would treat us exceptionally nice. He also asked us if the server told us about any of their specials and we responded with a no. So he told us about the specials which were discounted drinks.. however because two out of the 4 were driving we didn't want to drink. Just water for the night.  We looked at the menu and wanted to order the Texas Cheese Poppers but when we asked for them the server told us they were sold out... SHOCKING because this place was empty who else has been eating them? :( So we decided to go for the platter which has egg rolls, chicken bites and sliders. It was okay... I've had better. I really liked the egg rolls the most but I really wanted to try the Cheese Poppers.  I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Pasta which was cooked really well and had amazing texture! There were pieces of chips that made it crunchy which I loved! The chicken surprisingly wasn't dry and the overall taste was good! This is something that I would reorder if I ever came back...  Unfortunately for my friends though they didn't seem to like their meal as much and they told they wouldn't come back and wished that we went to Spoon and Fork which is located right beside this restaurant. My boyfriend ordered a Chicken Quesadilla and it was placed on a salad bed with sour cream... but no SALSA... so when we asked the manager for salsa he said it doesn't come with it. My boyfriend asked very politely ""Is it possible if we can have salsa?"" The manager seemed really offended and said in a upset voice ""What's the magic WORD?""  Honestly I get it that he didn't say please, but it wasn't like we were a bunch of noisy and rude teenagers trying to cause any trouble. We were having a double date with old friends that we haven't seen in a long time and wanted to continue catching up. This guy should've been happy that we came to the restaurant to eat. I know it's not right to treat people in a bad way but like I said we didn't cause and trouble at ALL. Caught off guard by what the manager said my boyfriend just said ""please"" to make this guy go away and provide us with the salsa that should've gone along with the quesadilla.  Overall, I would never come back to place unless some one paid for me and I wouldn't recommend this place at all. This place is horrible. But I did like my pasta and those rolls. -CL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2
Abbas N.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",381,272,68,3.0,8/22/2012,"If someone asked me what I thought of Chili's, I'd say ""Chili's reminds me of my childhood. Walking on Jumierah Beach, we'd go here after for the unlimited chips and salsa...and for every occasion we had to have the molten Lava Cake... Seriously though, Chili's was my favourite place growing up in Dubai. It's everyone's . We love it there. (Too bad they don't serv the alchz there) So when I heard that they opened up here in Canada, I got mad teary eyed and grabbed all my friends from Dubai and we headed over here. The menu was almost the same,  I was so happy. So we got the trio appz to start (called The Triple Play)  which was the texmex egg rolls, wings and chicken crispers) Firstly, In Dubai you get wings, the egg rolls and the dip. WTF with the crispers.  They were okay. Definitely not what I remembered. To eat, I got the Chicken Crispers meal with the Corn on cob, mashed potatoes, and Chicken Gravy. The Chicken was maaaad salty. The Gravy tasted like despair. But I think that's just how I feel abut chicken gravy anyways. My friend got th fajitas, which were relaly good. And ofcourse, we had to have the piece du resistance, the MCLC (Molten Choco Lava Cake) It was a tad bit burnt, but otherwise...just like we remembered it. We've been back a few times...mostly for the MCLC. And the Sangria in the summer. I drank like three pitchers of that in one sitting. Also, the friend I was with at that time didn't drink. I'm not an alcoholic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2

It wasn't as great as I'd anticipated, when I heard we were getting a Chili's I was BEYOND excited. Wah Woh.  I had the sliders...and while they were edible...they were the saltiest things EVER. Days later I read that that meal I had, had one of the highest sodium contents on the menu! Gross. Food does not need to be that salty. Everything else was meh. Nothing about it set it apart from any other Jack Astors/Kelsey's type places.

Canchi M.,"Markham, Canada",115,97,199,4.0,10/24/2012,"Chili's experience was great! we start of with a tequila pop. it's something I haven't seen for a long time. (when I first started drinking, me and my friends always do tequila pop...) then we are back on the right track with the Presidente margarita, we were shown what kind of tequila were used, and the way they serve it was great (for both side of the business and customer) we learned a lot about what great margarita is. then we get to try the Blackberry Margarita and Strawberry Margarita. I like them all! XD ranking would be  1. Presidente Margarita 2. Strawberry Margarita 3. Blackberry Margarita then we were served the best of the best, the Platinum Presidente Margarita!!! it's much smoother than the Presidente Margarita (it's already smooth, I didn't know it can be better!) oh, and I wanted to get the Platinum Presidente Margarita glass shaker as a water bottle... XD (I forgot to check-in to the place, so I forgot about the check-in offer that they have, it's free Tostada Chips + House made Salsa) (we did have food afterwards, that's the Savour York Region Restaurant week, from Oct 18 to 28, 2012. I will probably write that one when I get a chance to try more from their menu.) 10/15",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2

Charles R.,"Mississauga, Canada",14,120,4,1.0,5/1/2013,"Chili's is a branch of the US restaurant located in Vaughan, Ontario - hometown of the worst drivers in Canada.  If you don't get run over by a paisano going through the 4-way stop out of turn in his Ford F150 you're on your way to good food, and poor service. This restaurant has been The Red Devil, and East Side Mario's in it prior existance. We came here on a Saturday afternoon to celebrate my son's birthday.  Our group of 9 was seated promptly. SERVICE Our drink order was taken quickly.  However it took 20+ minutes for our collection of soda and chocolate milk to arrive at our table.  At one point my daughter was asked if she wanted a refill on her chocolate milkshake.  We should have been told that it was not a free refill. Our order of bottomless nacho chips and salsa arrived at our table less than 10 min before our entree did, so we weren't really able to enjoy it. The ice cream for the kids arrived well before my son's birthday brownie slice.  About 20% of the ice cream was melted by the time the brownie arrived. I think the manager overheard us complaining about how incompetant our server was, so we were compensated 2 lava cake desserts for the table. Final point - if you're going to automatically include a 15% gratuity on the bill, can you please ensure the service merits that kind of gratuity.  My parents taught me to be a 10% tipper, and I will tip 15% only when either the food was amazing or the server went out of their way for us. FOOD My son had the mac and cheese and loved it.  Older daughter had the grilled cheese and devoured it.  Youngest daughter had the cheese pizza - I tried a taste and it was icky.  I think it was a microwave pizza from M&Ms. The wife had the honey chicken crispers.  She felt they were comparable to the Chili's in Buffalo (that's a good thing).  I had the Jalepeno Smokehouse burger.  If you like a burger that's a balance between pain and pleasure - then you've found it.  You have the heat from the Jalepeno's offset by the taste of the bacon. For dessert we were compensated a chocolate lava cake.  It was darn good, especially the lava. On its own, the food could have netted 3.5 stars.  Service and Ambiance killed this. AMBIANCE The restaurant was good.  Well lit, fairly new feel to it. The men's washroom was a different story.  One of the urinals was broken and spewing water all over the place.  Putting a caution wet floor sign up doesn't really cover you from slip and fall lawsuits.  If the plumbing were up to current code, someone with a wrench could have shut off the water flow from the urinal, and the entire washroom floor wouldn't have been a mess. I had brought this to the manager's attention.  I was told that she had to wait her her guy.  I'm assuming it was someone under contract to corporate.  Managers should have the power to call whomever they want.  This is a business and there are a lot of 24-hour plumbing services that would be willing to help out.  There has to be a balance between frugality and maintaining the image of the business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2
Liz F.,"Toronto, Canada",3,1,,1.0,6/20/2014,Who would want the chips and salsa at the end of the meal? In the middle of a meal maybe yes but not in the end of a meal...

Linda M.,"Toronto, Canada",89,112,2,1.0,6/11/2012,"On a fun day of random-adventures with a rental car, my grew-up-in-the-States boyfriend saw the sign for Chili's.  I decided not to be my usual restaurant-snob self and let him choose.  Unfortunately neither of us left happy. Warning: the following review is very restaurant-snobbish.  This reviewer is clearly spoiled by Toronto choices When we walked in, I was immediately struck by how so many chain restaurants look so similar.  Big signs all over the huge space, cartoon-y images, even the tables.  Opening the menu I was kind of surprised though - for lunch, there was nothing under $10.  I was really hoping to get something light (to save money for future better restaurants), and figured since it was a chain there was a good chance they would have cheaper options.  I ordered the cheapest thing that looked appealing and somewhat filling: a turkey club sandwich.  The boyfriend ordered the Grilled chicken sandwich.   We got our meals shortly after...and wow.  Flavour, presentation, uniqueness....all completely absent.  I could have made that club sandwich when I was 12 years old.  It was basically on Wonder bread!  The fries, I'll admit, had good seasoning.  It's too bad they were completely undercooked and limp.  Not undercooked to the point of being raw, just not at all crispy - they drooped when picked up.  I didn't try my DP's sandwich, and I'm usually all over everyone else's food.  Zero interest this time.   The boyfriend kept apologizing for the choice, but it wasn't his fault.  Apparently they've gone seriously downhill in the last few years.  All in all...if you're thinking of stopping in here, keep driving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2
Melissa a.,"Toronto, Canada",3,26,,1.0,8/27/2012,"I've never even been to this restaurant in the US but we were in the mood for burgers and after looking at their menu online it sounded appeitizing. We order the Smokehouse burger and the Jalapeno Smokehouse. First off, the place and the cutlery/glasses/plates are dirty. We order a pitcher of beer and the glasses had what looked like BBQ sauce on the rim. I took my napkin and wiped it along and sure enough it was some sort of sauce. I mentioned it to the server and she brought me another one and the second one was clean-er... it has less BBQ sauce along the rim but nevertheless it had to be wiped off. The cutlery/plates looked banged up as if this place had been around for 100 years, its only a few years old I dont know why everything appeared so run down. As for the food, it was alright. The burgers were decent. If it werent for the bacon, which was very flavorful, the burgers would be nothing. Btw, my boyfriend ordered onion rings, and instead got a side of onion straws, you know the same topping that was in his burger- which didnt make any sense. Would I go back? Nope",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2
