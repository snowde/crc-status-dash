Marvin M.,"Milwaukee, WI",33,175,66,3.0,12/19/2017,Food is fine. The staff working here apparently don't care about their workplace. I saw a pre-wrapped silverware package on the floor and the guy who seats people walked past it twice and never picked it up. He looked at it both times but apparently considered it someone else's job. That says a lot about the place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2
Christina K.,"Round Lake, IL",88,79,44,1.0,11/11/2017,"I usually stay clear of chain restaurants like ""Chili's, Applebee's, etc"". But we wanted a burger and were in the area. I had just gotten out of a LONG day of work. My boyfriend and I are very easy going people. Always super polite, tip well, and are patient/understanding. We should have known better...  About 10 minutes after being seated (we were already served drinks by another gentlemen) our server arrived. She immediately seemed rude. Just her tone of voice and facial expressions. She asked if we were ready to order. And we said no. But put in our appetizer. When she came back to take our orders I told her I would like a burger cooked  medium well. She immediately interrupted and said (pink or no pink?!) I said ""medium well please"". She again (pink or no pink!? We don't do medium well. Do you want pink or not). I said okay then, pink.  When my burger arrived I but it in half. It was literally raw. Medium rare to be exact. The out side was cooked but the inside was raw ground beef. This wasn't ""pink"" this was raw. So I told a gentlemen if they could cook it more. He took it with no hesitation and said right away. On his way back to the kitchen he spoke with our server which I overheard her say ""SHE ORDERED IT PINK! I'll bring it back to her"". So she comes back with the food I sent back and says ""YOU WANTED THIS PINK. This is pink."" I explained to her that it was raw. And she said ""IF YOU WANT IT PINK THAN THIS IS WHAT IT WILL BE!!"" I said fine, make it well done then. And she stormed off...  You see. I'm fine with kit hen mix ups. I don't mind waiting for food again. Because well, things happen. And I want to pay for something that I actually want. But this lady was very rude. She spoke to me like I was stupid. Her name was Carie. And I wasn't the only table that she was being like this to. The food was Shit. And the service from Carrie was shit. I will never spend my money here again. I will also be sure to tell ever single military official I Work with how they treat people there. (P.s everyone else that stopped by our table was nice. Carrie sucked tho)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2
Jennifer B.,"Grayslake, IL",0,4,,1.0,1/6/2018,"I'm sorry to say that this Chili's has really gone downhill.  We used to love coming here, service was good, food was decent, convenient location.  But over the last year, service has become slow and the staff seems to really not care about the quality of the food or experience.  The restrooms are DISGUSTING, the floors in the dining area are always dirty, even when the restaurant is empty.  Everything just feels sticky and gross.  We won't be back until there are some major improvements.  If the portion that the diners see is this dirty, is makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2
Angela D.,"Chicago, IL",106,103,110,4.0,3/20/2017,"We came here for lunch right before the Sunday lunch rush, and the server recommended the smothered chicken tenders appetizer. It was HUGE! All the servers were very attentive and frindly to their tables, and the manager came by to check on people too. We had a great server, Jennifer, who mentioned that they have a ""buddy system"" that helps them back each other up while not getting double or triple-sat at once. Their system seems to work really well as we watched it get busy but the servers stayed efficient.  They also said a new menu is coming out soon, along with a watermelon margarita for summer. We'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2
Tashea S.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,4,,1.0,10/28/2017,"This was my first (and probably the last) visit to this restaurant and it was a horrible experience. Firstly, the drinks are ridiculously expensive for what you get. Their pictures are pure false advertisement, my 'margarita' was just a glass of ice with a piece of fruit. Even though the wait was reasonable the food itself was deplorable. The ribs were so dry I had to ask for more bbq sauce to avoid choking . The fries were cold and not well done at all. The only meal that looked palatable were their enchiladas. The burgers were still pink in the middle when served. I wouldn't even serve this food to my dog.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2
Jason B.,"Round Lake, IL",0,24,4,2.0,5/10/2017,"We spent about $60 here around 3:00 PM this afternoon and it wasn't worth it at all. First, the food took an extremely long time to come out. We were there for 45 minutes before we even saw our appetizers. The loaded boneless chicken wings didn't have any queso on them and were overcooked. We brought it to the attention of the waitress and she told us the queso was underneath the wings, We told her there was none under there, but she insisted, to the point of being rude, it had to be under there.  My wife ordered the buffalo chicken salad, there were no blue cheese crumbles on it and I ordered a burger that was bland, dry and overcooked. The fried pickles we ordered were mostly chunks of breading in the bag with a few pickles scattered throughout. The only decent item was the fries. Finally, our waitress was never around. I have no idea where she was, but she didn't even offer us refills on our drinks. The place wasn't empty, but by no means was it busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2
Buddy D.,"Gurnee, IL",0,24,22,1.0,10/9/2017,"Bad Chili's!!! Buyer beware! (Go to the one in Waukegan, by the bowling alley) The food is standard, but the service is deplorable. I dropped off a group of 11 teens, all dressed up for Homecoming. They had a reservation and had evidence of it, and the hostess turned them away! It was 5:30 PM! It was not crowded, and the manager could have easily pushed two tables together! I picked up the kids and drove them to Buffalo Wild Wings, who welcomed them!

Joe D.,"Chicago, IL",65,44,11,4.0,3/19/2017,"We had a very tasty meal. The smothered chicken tenders are very cheesy and delicious- not exactly healthy though.

Joy B.,"Wadsworth, IL",0,19,,3.0,3/23/2017,Hostess had her back to us as we walked to the door - I could see through the glass doors that she turned her head and saw us coming - but she kept her back turned until we were at the hostess stand when she finally turned around and greeted us.  I Asked if we could have a specific booth that was empty- she said no. Not sure what her reasoning was so I left it alone.  Never asked if we needed highchair or booster seat.  Took us to a table with crumbs all over it and walked away.  I walked back to the hostess stand and asked if someone could wipe our table because it was dirty- she said yes- but no one ever came.  Besides that our server was very nice - our food was also good.  It seems like employees could use a little extra training.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2
Chuck D.,"Libertyville, IL",0,2,,2.0,8/18/2017,"This restaurant is pretty below average. The seating areas are satisfactory clean, but nothing over the top. The bathrooms were disgusting. Two of the latches in the women's bathroom stalls didn't work, and the other stalls were a complete mess, not to mention the soap and towel dispensers are broken.  I over hear servers talking impolitely about a few of their tables and that they deserve 100% tips. Yikes.  Food is okay. Just average. Service was very very slow, although our server was VERY nice. We did appreciate that, at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2
Ramsey B.,"Palos Hills, IL",401,538,21,4.0,10/11/2016,"Enjoy dining at this Chili's due to their EXCELLENT customer service.  The food is well prepared as most Chili's locations.  The carribean salad with grilled chicken is my favorite entree along with their soups (all of them, especially the chicken enchilada).  The service is off the charts...friendly staff and constant follow up.  I'll be back, that's for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2

The unlimited soup with salad is a solid choice for those cold days, but my money's on the salmon with a double-up of veggies.  Good portion, prepared perfectly, and served piping hot.

Kyle H.,"Milwaukee, WI",903,1458,2722,1.0,1/4/2016,"No, just no. Stopped here during slow drive during crappy weather this past week, needed to break for lunch. Since neaby Chipotle is still battling how to serve food without eColi, we came here, but it wasn't much better than getting eColi.  I used to really like Chili's. Was I tastebud challenged? Walking in to this Chili's the first thing we notice is there's no Hostess stand by the entry, the layout is really odd, and the restaurant looks like it's from the late 80's, in need of a facelift for sure.  Our server was plenty nice, no complaints. Our meals were kinda crappy. The side salad of mixed greens tasted horrible (and I like mixed greens!). Unlimited salad? No thank you. The chili I ordered was just okay. Skip this place for the nearby Steak 'n' Shake or Chipotle (take your chances with Chipotle eColi!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2

Clara C.,"Gurnee, IL",72,33,2,4.0,2/4/2017,We waited a while for a table but it was Friday night so that was expected. We ended up being seated in the Lounge at a table that had been empty since we arrived over twenty minutes before. No big deal though...I understand sometimes servers need a chance to catch up!

Donna C.,"Antioch, IL",0,6,,2.0,10/16/2017,"This particular Chillis used to be a favorite of ours, whenever we were in Gurnee it was our go to restaurant. Havn't been there in over a year & visited yesterday with a party of six family members. Wow this place went downhill! The place was more than half empty yet we were seated crushed up with the few other guests that were in there. Soft drinks, chips & salsa came out quick but had to wait forever for the one beer that was ordered. Entrees took even longer to come out, I asked the server if our food was ready & she came back with food for three of us while the others waited.  Burgers came out without fries, apparently they weren't quite ready & fajitas were just warm. Had three sets of silverware that were so dirty & still had food crusted on. Floor was dirty from previous guests.

Ian T.,"DeKalb, IL",0,6,5,1.0,1/9/2017,"I stopped in for dinner this past weekend. As my entree, I ordered the steak fajitas. I'm not someone who ever sends my food back in a restaurant...even if I don't like, I'll usually just grin & bear. After trying to consume what they presented me, I actually had to send my food back. The guacamole was brown-ish, 1/2 of each of the flour tortillas were hard as a rock, the shredded cheese was hard, and what they called ""steak"" were cubes of meat cooked way past well done & so full of cartilage that I couldn't even bite thru them. Not sure how that could be served to customers. Management needs to take a much closer look at quality control/what is being served as this is completely unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2

Jackie H.,"Glenview, IL",32,77,53,2.0,3/26/2015,"Bad service and the wait staff is really rude. I don't eat chicken, and most of their salads have chicken on them. Last time I was there, I saw a note on the menu that you could have avocado on a salad, so I asked for a Caesar salad with avocado instead of chicken. The waiter looked at me like I was crazy, and he said ""why don't you just order a salad with caesar dressing and avocado?"" I looked at him and said ""is that not what I just ordered?"" And he didn't respond. Maybe he was trying to save us money, I don't know, but his tone and attitude was uncalled for. The salad was good. But I felt completely embarrassed in front of my fiancé's family. Hoping we don't go back to this location. Wish I could remember the servers name.

Ronnie V.,"Northbrook, IL",506,74,97,1.0,4/7/2016,As you can tell from other reviews this place is bad. My girlfriend Hellen ordered a steak medium well as did I. When it came out her steak was rare.

Ordered our drinks and food when she finally came over, ya know..after another waiter had to tell her she has a table filled. She came by once to check on us and we paid with their little system because she didn't come back. Okay food. Poor service and poor environment.

Christine G.,"Round Lake, IL",0,9,1,1.0,11/6/2016,"My friend and I came out for just a nice lunch out together. We should have not come to this location. It took our waitress, Brittany, almost 10 minutes to come and get our drink order. By that time we had already decided what we were gonna eat. We asked for two extra plates as we were going to share our meals. The plates she brought us were small and mine was dirty and I asked for a new one and she seemed perturbed that she had to get me one. She barely checked on us. When we got the check, she said we could take care of it whenever we were ready. Well, we were both ready right away and she was cleaning tables right by us. I get that she had some other tables but to not even check on us is unacceptable.

Maameamba A.,"Waukegan, IL",76,2,,1.0,12/22/2015,I typically don't post but had to share how impersonal and rude our server was at Chilies. My 6 year old loves this place and I was very disappointed with how we regarded by our service there. The dark skinned server was not attentive and when I noticed the white woman accommodating her table and ours it made me want to b seated with her versus who we had. When I mentioned my concern to the manager he tried to clean it up but it was a little too little too late. The sweet white woman came to check on us periodically and did her best to turn it around. I'll be back but want to make sure I don't have him again. By the way I still left him 10%. Totally not deserving.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=20
Mr. P.,"North Chicago, IL",8,8,,2.0,10/4/2014,"I will NOT be back to this Chili's! I've never really thought of chain restaurants as being different and LOVE Chili's.  I researched this one and saw really bad reviews, but thought that maybe you can't always trust other people's thoughts, I wish I had. My order was messed up from the drink to the meat on the fajitas, which I can deal with. I asked for corn tortillas though because of a gluten allergy and was brought flour and it took awhile to get the waitress back to fix this problem to the point of cold food which is just annoying.  My boyfriend however was brought out a steak with a giant hair on it and at that point we were done. The service was awful and nothing we ordered was right. He was comped his meal though which was the only redeeming thing about this particular Chili's. I will take my business elsewhere from now on. TRUST other people's reviews at this place though!

I repeated twice what I wanted and when the food came out it wasn't even correct. She did not even apologize nor did she even come by once to see if everything tasted okay.

Asked for waters, didn't get them. Never asked our satisfaction on food. Gave us our check without us asking for it and my girlfriend and I both wanted another drink. She seemed unhappy to be at work, no manors or smile. Also did not say bye to us or thank us for our service. I'm sorry but that's just the basics of food service. We weren't complicated at all.

Raymond M.,"Chicago, IL",10,23,49,3.0,2/12/2014,"After a long gruesome day of shopping at Gurnee Mills, my sister and I decided to eat here as it would be really late to eat dinner at home. It has been a really, really long time since I went to Chili's. I only remember that my friends recommended the Loaded Potato Skins; that's what my sister and I started with. The Loaded Potato Skins were delicious. The 3-cheese blend was nicely melted and stringy. The Applewood smoked bacon gave it a nice crispiness and saltiness to each piece. The sour cream gave it richness. I would like it if there were more green onions; I couldn't taste the green onions because the other toppings were overpowering. A little more crispiness to the potato skins would give more dimensions to contrast the soft and warm texture of the potatoes. Then, I had the Guacamole Burger. It was difficult to eat it because the guacamole would be squished out whenever you take a big bite. I had to take many little bites; it was delicious. The guacamole was fresh and creamy. The burger was spicier than I expected from the fire-roasted jalapenos. The sautéed red & green bell peppers and caramelized onions were sweet. The meat was very juicy and had little bits of crispiness at the edges. The fries were nice; they were crispy on the outside and really soft in the inside. All the deliciousness was tied together well by the guacamole. We did not have dessert because we were full - great portions. The service was great. The server was very nice and made sure our food arrived in an appropriate time. She comes by every so often to check up on us and refilled our water without being prompted. I highly recommend the Loaded Potato Skins. 3 stars for decent good food and awesome service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=20

After getting our drinks, it took her another 15 mins to come back to take our order for our entrees. After that... We didn't get our food for another 45 minutes. But while waiting... I got the manager and explained it was taking forever for everything... Even though they were not busy at all... All the manager offered us was a small basket of fries... Wow.

Two of us ordered combo meals, while the other two just ordered entrees. The soup came in a timely manner of 10 minutes, but the entrees took at least 30 minutes. I was pretty surprised at the slow service since it was in the middle of the day. I ordered the $7 lunch combo southwestern mac and cheese with a small bowl of baked potato soup. Both were very salty and I ended up having to drink 2 pints of water. The portions for the combo were also very small, about the size of my open hand.  My brother ordered the chicken fajitas combo meal. It was enough for 3 small fajitas, but according to my brother, it was not very satisfying. The dinner entrees were decently sized. The south western bbq burger was tender and juicy and had plenty of toppings. My only complaints about this dish was that the fries were way too salty and that the bun was cold when we had received the order. The half slab Memphis dry rub ribs were decent, but I've obviously had better.  The molten lava cake was good. Standard bundt chocolate cake, chocolate syrup, and ice cream. Best part of the meal. So overall, just mediocre food and minimal service. I'll probably not come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Grace G.,"Morton Grove, IL",183,29,1,4.0,9/6/2014,"Came in with a party of 8 for a family member's birthday. We were seated fairly quickly for coming in at the dinner rush on a Saturday night. The food was great, my only complaint food wise was that my fajita's came with hardly any peppers, it did however, come with a whole onion. Besides that everything tasted delicious. The service was up to par I guess, wasn't the best service I've had at a Chili's but I would come back. Oh and I was left uneasy that the server walked away with my driver's license after being carded, bitch I'm 23 I don't need a fake ID. Totally improper (in my opinion) way to handle carding a customer. My four stars only go to the Chef's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Jarael C.,"Round Lake, IL",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2014,I just sat here for 20 minutes waiting for someone to even ask for my drink order which never happened. I am pregnant and no one even acknowledged my presence besides the hostess who seated me. I just walked out and won't ever be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Jake T.,"Evans, GA",10,72,48,1.0,8/23/2013,Served a extremely dirty glass. The feeling I get from the staff here is that they just don't care. This is my second time here in two months and the sanitary conditions seemed to have worsened. I shouldn't have to worry about if I'm going to get sick or not eating the food here. Definitely needs a reorganization.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Scott V.,"Mundelein, IL",57,55,15,1.0,12/30/2010,"Yes, this is crappy chain restaurant food.  The problem with this Chili's is that they cannot even execute basic crappy chain restaurant food.  My son's cheeseburger was very overcooked and the bun was stale. I ordered a steak sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was fine, but the fries seemed like they were from the night before-overly seasoned, tiny pieces and over cooked.  These fries were from the bottom of the french fry pile. Last, but not least, the service was absolute crap.  They had three servers for the middle of the afternoon on a weekday.  That should be enough, it was not busy.  Our waitress took forever to do anything, then she screwed up the bill too.  She charged us for things that we did indeed order, however we never received.  Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
John J.,"Naperville, IL",17,156,2,2.0,1/3/2013,It's rated 2 stars for a reason.  This location has earned it.  Mediocre and nothing more.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Jazzmine W.,"Waukegan, IL",161,24,19,1.0,8/6/2014,"I work in the area and decided to come in for lunch. I was by myself so the hostess asked if I wanted a seat in the bar I took her up on her offer. I get there and the waitress is casually speaking with the table in front of me. I believe she may have known them. She finally walks over and takes my drink order. (Water with lemon) she returns with my drink and there is a huge piece of shredded cheese sitting on top of my lemon. Had she been paying attention she definitely would have saw that prior to bringing it over. She walks away, I flag her down showing her the cheese, asking for a new water and she says omg let get that fixed for you. Returns maybe 15 seconds later, no cheese, flipped over lemon (picked it off) and as I begin to drink from my cup I notice something green on the inside of the glass. I messed with it using my straw it began to flick off the side of my cup into my water. (Totally grossed out) I call her back over and show the dirty glass. She explains to me that it's cilantro from when they wash the dishes and goes to get me another water. Thinking to myself I don't care what it is. It's gross, dirty and disgusting and I don't want it anymore. She brings me a water I didn't even bother drinking. I was grossed out. Brings my food, grilled chicken and corn on the cob. The sandwich tasted a little funny. Idk if they changed the bread but something was different, the corn came with no butter barely any flavor. I was very disappointed and won't be returning to this location. Ever. One star because the waitress was polite but didn't make things right as far as the hazardous mistakes that were made. I should've went to eat next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Mary M.,"Waukegan, IL",0,18,,2.0,7/7/2011,"The food at this Chili's is the same as every other Chili's.  So whatever.  But this particular restaurant is always dirty. There's a layer of grime on the tables that just needs to be sanded off (or they need new tables).   If you want Chili's, go to the one on Waukegan Road, near the Wal-Mart at Fountain Square in Waukegan instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Chad H.,"San Francisco, CA",31,496,175,2.0,9/20/2009,"What is it about Chili's that they feel the need to douche everything in salt?  This Chili's in particular is very salty.  Ugh.  Their burger is okay I guess but in general this is a Chili's, so you know what you're getting (i.e. low quality, chain restaurant food). As far as Gurnee Mills restaurants go, it's better than TGI Friday's and worse than Lone Star.  I can't recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Gabby J.,"Gurnee, IL",0,2,,1.0,2/26/2014,"This is the WORST place to eat!! First the server took 20 minutes to come to the table and then doesn't introduce himself, asks if were ready to order. Then trying to make conversation, he is RUDE and disrespectful. Called my table difficult and said we were holding him up. Then while asking him why were difficult, he says I have to go get something I'll be back and you can talk as much SHIT as you want! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! Then my meal was wrong, not what I ordered. I called for a manager and the manager was rude, and did not help the situation AT ALL. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS CHILIS! EVER!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Amy C.,"Gurnee, IL",23,49,2,3.0,5/28/2008,"I go here because I love the soup. However, the service is always hit or miss.  The bar doesn't have red bull.... weird... The food always tastes the same, just like a good ol' chain restaurant should.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Michelle W.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,577,80,4.0,11/29/2005,"Very good and prompt service for a chain restaurant.  For those of you familiar with Grand Avenue in Gurnee it is the land of chain eats and Chili's is a tried and true favorite.  Definitely try the Chicken Enchilada Soup, it is good and cheap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
Edwin M.,"Gurnee, IL",0,59,1,3.0,3/8/2010,"Be careful when getting take-out from here (which I do a few times a month).  Always check your order before you leave.  They mess up from time to time.  Other than that, the food quality is about on par with any other Chili's.  Service in the restaurant is hit-or-miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40
