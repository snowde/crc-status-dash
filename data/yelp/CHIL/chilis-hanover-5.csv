Mia L.,"Glen Burnie, MD",51,172,196,3.0,10/28/2015,"Chili's is a chain so of course, there's nothing special going on here. However, when you're hungry and want to go out to eat with a group of people with different tastes and preferences, Chili's has plenty of options and there's something for everyone.  I visited the Arundel Mills location recently. I don't like how small it is. There was a line of people waiting but the line moved quickly and my group of 4 was seated at a booth. I ordered the ranchero chicken tacos which tasted good but were greasy. They had liquid dripping from them. Not sure if they were supposed to be like that but again, they tasted good. The service was decent. Overall, it was okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5

Michael K.,"Crownsville, MD",0,47,,4.0,8/19/2016,Food was really good.  Hostess was rude to start with and put us at a wet table.   Managr quickly corrected problem.  Server was go very prompt and couteous.  Food arrived quickly and was delicious   2 for $22 is a great deal.  Onion rings were excellent.  Mango Chile lime chicken was spicy but good.  Portions sizes were perfect.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5
Jane D.,"Glen Burnie, MD",11,7,5,2.0,12/27/2016,"Food is good, but it doesn't outweigh the TERRIBLE service.  What came here on a Tuesday at 2:00 (not a busy time).  Took 15 minutes to order drinks.  Appetizer showed up after the meal.  And we didn't get the 2 kids meals till 20 minutes AFTER we got our food.   This use to be a great place.  Won't be coming back.  Far to many choices on where to eat to deal with shit service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5

JaCara S.,"Savage, MD",17,54,117,4.0,9/4/2014,"When I go here, I frequent the bar. Dylan is the bartender I always get and I love him. He always makes tastey  drinks and is so likable. The food is what it is. I do feel like they Are hit or miss, in my experience  it's usually ok. But I do say the happy hour is great and its not expensive. The service I've gotten even when my food doesn't come out well puts this chili's on the top. Its how you finish and I always leave happy Smile!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5
Charles K.,"Largo, MD",131,130,33,1.0,4/1/2016,"I went to this chili's for a quick drink.  The bartender was very rude to me and my guest.  We didn't ask her anything out of the normal.  Just questions like ""Any Happy Hour specials?""  I thought this rudeness was just reserved for us, but she was equally rude to the other patrons.  I do not think I will patronize this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5
Keshia S.,"Richmond, VA",16,8,6,1.0,3/30/2016,"The one star is due to the extremely long wait for everything. Had lunch on a weekday. The restaurant wasn't busy at all yet everything was very slow. Drinks took a while to come and all we ordered was water, blackberry tea and Sprite. After we finished eating the server had disappeared again when we needed the check. Next time I'll stick with the food court for lunch. Never again!!!! Lunch doesn't take over an hour!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5

Lynna K.,"Catonsville, MD",66,52,118,2.0,5/25/2015,"Very disappointed!  Had the chili queso-salty n the chips were super greasy  Guacamole-the best part of the whole meal Trio sampler (boneless buffalo wings, dill pickles, chicken fingers-was ok. Smoked wings-some were undercooked Bacon burger-was ok Pick 3 (tostada,taco, beef enchilada)-taco was good, tostada was ok,  enchilada was heavily sauced and the rice was dried out.  The waiter was the worst. I asked for lemon for my water 4 times and never got it. I asked for a box and he took 6 min. And there was no excuse as half the restaurant was empty. And to top all of that, we were charged for the game thing they have on every table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5
Tabbetha P.,"Baltimore, MD",51,1,,2.0,3/10/2016,Went here last night for dinner with the family the waitress didn't write anything down as soon as we ordered our drinks I could tell the service was gonna suck out of 6 drinks that we ordered only 1 was right we order the onion rings for a app she brought out egg rolls so we had to wait another 20min for them to come out when we finally got ourmeals they we're cold and half the order was wrong we ended up missing our movie because of the extra time we had to be there waiting on the right food this was our 1st time going to chili's on would go back because the food once it was hot n what we ordered was good but I will never go back to the 1 at arundel mills mall,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5
Mike K.,"Baltimore, MD",33,237,197,3.0,11/20/2015,"Stopped in to Chili's after a little bit of shopping for dinner. My aunt and I decided to just get some beers and split some appetizers since it was happy hour. The beers were cold and served in frosted glasses. They were the coldest beer I've ever had but definitely were refreshing. We got a chipotle chicken flatbread, boneless wings, and southwest egg rolls. All of the food is what you expect from Chili's - your typical fried bar finger food kind of stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5
Keith K.,"Frederick, MD",57,40,,4.0,7/14/2016,"I came to Chillis with my wife and 2 buddies for lunch. It was around noon and it was not difficult to get a table.  Around the table, we got Cajun Pasta, Salmon, Steak and a Burger. Everything was well cooked and the Cajun Pasta was awesome. Prices were affordable and the service was very good. Our waitress was Arie and she did a very good job. This is my first time coming to Chillis in years and it was interesting to see the electronic ordering machine on the table. We were able to print our check right from the table with no issues. Overall, I would go back to this Chilli's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5
C J.,"Severn, MD",2,63,16,4.0,11/25/2015,"Excellent experience at the Chillis in the Arundel Mills Mall food court. My mother and I decided to eat here. The place was clean. The waiter provided excellent service! He was pleasant, came by several times to make sure we were fine. I needed something each time. He happily came back with what we wanted. We had  theTex Mex Fajitas with chicken, steak and shrimp and a house salad. We shared both of the orders which were really good. I would recommend this place for lunch and dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5

Demetrius L.,"Severn, MD",13,67,51,3.0,4/16/2014,The food was as good as any chain restaurant will be. Food was hot and came out in a timely fashion.   I'm more of a customer a customer service guy myself.  We sat by the front entrance while an employee ruffled through the station looking for cigarettes while holding a drink. I would post his name but they wear no name tags here. But he is the only guy here with braids and earings. As we stood there we were not acknowledged as he walked out to smoke. My waiter was great and attentive. Unfortunately his coworker brings my rating down,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5
Alejandro M.,"Silver Spring, MD",3,25,4,3.0,12/9/2013,"My wife and I were starving after walking around the mall. We decide to eat something. The court food does not give you a great variety. Chilli's was our choice. our server was a nice young lady who too good care of us. I order two appetizers and two main courses. the portions are kind of big for us.  Quality of food, portions were big, the food is spicy, (for me it was, for my wife it wasn't) The apetizers were very nice, I recomend the western spring rolls. my burger was ok and my wife's, food (bbq ribs) were ok also.       Service. The server was a very nice young lady. but what I like the most is that the manager was going from table to table to check on the customers and thank for coming in. He came to talk to us twice to our table.       Overall, this is nice choice inside the mall, but I would not go if I have another options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5
Joe K.,"Baltimore, MD",0,4,,1.0,6/1/2016,"A place we shall not return! There were roaches on the floor near our table, needless to say, it ruined our appetite.  The service was good, the chicken fajitas were flavorless and soggy.

Elaine H.,"Arnold, MD",46,88,11,5.0,3/27/2015,This chilis has the best happy hour deals. Not to mention happy hour goes until 8 p.m. most places only go until like 6 or 7. wine is $2.99 a glass !!!! You can't beat that the bartenders are very friendly. Not to mention the food is very flavorful the burger sliders they have are out of this world! it's a must try! I have not had anything there that I'm not impressed with. and we go at least twice a month!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20
Kimberly B.,"Ellicott City, MD",2,3,3,1.0,11/23/2015,I give this Chili only one star.  If I could not give a star that would be great!!!  I was served by Lauren M. (#69).  I sat at the bar and asked for a golden margarita.  Lauren the bartender looked confused and snapped and said what and rolled her eyes.  So I politely gave her the ingredients for the cocktail.  I explained that I wanted Grand Marnier and not the normal Cointreau.  She acted as if she did not know what Cointreau was this was puzzling as I bartend myself.  She gave me the drink.  As I sat at the bar and was 1/2 way through my drink I flagged her down for my receipt as she seemed overwhelmed.  She again rolled her eyes when I asked for the receipt.  When she returned with the receipt she slapped it down on the counter with a bit of an attitude.   At this time I asked to speak to a manager.  He came and I explained what had transpired and how I was taken back by her attitude while serving me.  He offered to refund my bill of $10.89 which was not what I was seeking yet he proceeded with the refund and spoke to the bartender at the register while processing my refund. As I am finishing my drink the Caucasian female patron sitting two bar stools from me engages in an audible conversation with the bartender on how blacks are always running scams and I just wanted to get over. At that point I no longer wanted the rest of my drink!  I immediately got up told the manager about the conversation of that had transpired and told him I would be reporting. So here it is!!!! Ironically this is not the 1st time I have received awful service here.  Just a year ago I reported this same location to the health department and corporate.   Quick Synopsis: Placed a order of mashed potatoes corn and chicken.  Plate came to table with 2 sides of corn on the cob...told waitress and she takes her hand picked up the corn off my plate with her bare hands and proceeds to carry it back to the kitchen. Stick a fork in me...I was done...floored. I learned my lesson to never go back here...EVER.  Any establishment with such poor customer service and racist comments from staff will never receive my money again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20
Jessica F.,"Stafford, VA",60,8,,3.0,12/29/2014,"The food court has a few options but neither myself or my bf where in the mood for them. Chilis seemed like our best bet as it gave us a chance to sit down for a few and people watch. This chili's is a little small but we were seated immediately. I forgot our servers name but I would sit in her section again anytime since she was very attentive/friendly.  The bf ordered their tripple dipper with wings, eggrolls and mini burgers (without bacon) and I ordered the southwest salad (dressing on the side) if you ever order a salad from chili's get the dressing on the side they drown the salad with salad dressing. overall it wasn't bad I would go back again plus it beats going to the buffalo wild wings here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20
Amira A.,"Brooklyn, NY",355,707,388,3.0,4/15/2013,I simply ordered the cheesecake since I had eaten earlier. It was decent. I just wish it had a bit more strawberry puree. My friends food looked good. I was going to order the pom margarita until I was told it comes in a small shot glass like cup. For $10 they can shove it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20
S C.,"Gambrills, MD",14,265,118,2.0,2/6/2014,"Heather was a unfriendly, rushing and generally rude server. Topped off by the smell of cigarette smoke from her long absences of service. Will specifically not have her again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20
Mike C.,"Howard, MD",0,164,,2.0,2/17/2014,"We ate here on an early Sunday afternoon and things started off on the bad foot.  There was a line of people waiting outside of the restaurant, but no hostess.  Was the place simply packed?  No.  After 10 minutes, a lady behind us in line went to see what was going on.  When she returned, she reported that there were plenty of empty tables and that she asked a server to get someone to start seating customers.  A hostess eventually appeared and people were then quickly seated.  As we were taken to our table, I noticed several un-bussed dirty tables near ours.  It took an additional 10 minutes for someone to finally come over and clear those tables. Our server was efficient, but not enthusiastic.  She was there to bring refills, but not around when we needed the check.   The food (which we really enjoy at the Eldersburg location) was disappointing.  Our flatbread pizzas - potentially excellent - had too much of the ranch-like sauce and were quite salty.  Our basket of fries were overcooked and just warm.  Our son's quesadillas were not good.  They were soaked with oil, like a well buttered grilled cheese, and the oil tasted old.  When the waitress asked if he wanted a take-out container for the 3 of 4 unconsumed quesadillas, I replied ""no"" saying that none of us liked them at all.  She ignored the comment, saying she'd bring just the one box for my daughter's Kraft mac and cheese. Each table has a tablet-like device for ordering food and playing games.  It's all too easy for kids to start games that cost money (about a buck).  Even more reason not to talk to your family during dinner.  (The family next to us:  The young boy was on a cellphone, the young daughter was on an iPad, and the one adult was playing on Chili's tablet.)  It allows you to ask for refills, order dessert, and pay your check, when, all too common in places like this, your server is nowhere to be found.  We paid using the tablet and left without having the server thank us. Overall, Chili's has a good menu, but the execution here was not good during our visit.  It seemed to need an adult manager presence to get things in shape.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20
Vida O.,"Loudoun County, VA",140,333,5,3.0,11/24/2012,"In a perfect location at the mall, you can grab some grub while shopping. The air conditioning is lacking like in the rest of the mall but the food is great here. I love the bottomless chips and mango ice tea.  Service is inconsistent and depends on which server is there.

Lauren S.,"Baltimore, MD",264,628,89,3.0,6/21/2011,"Unlike most Chili's, this place is smaller, hence the 'Too' added to it. Same food as every other Chili's, nothing spectacular.

J. T.,"Portland, OR",4,42,8,5.0,12/31/2013,"My boyfriend and I recently went here and the food was great, but the service was even better!  The waitress mis-heard my boyfriends order (he ordered a sandwich and she brought him the same dish in salad form), but she took it back.  The manager came over and told us they were going to make a new plate of the correct order and that it would be on the house.  I though that was outstanding customer service!  I will definitely return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20
Jamie E.,"Baltimore, MD",1,28,2,2.0,7/15/2013,"I am a fan of Chili's in general, for a chain restaurant  the food is pretty good. However, my recent experience at this location was not good at all. The restaurant itself was not very clean and the bathrooms were HORRIBLE! There were Gnats everywhere! It was just disgusting. My husband said the same for the mens room.

Ma-e M.,"Baltimore County, MD",0,1416,571,3.0,4/25/2012,"I was hungry and ready to eat, but later to find out that Chili's is inside the mall. The restaurant does not have their parking space. Unfortunately, at this mall, parking is hard to find. The AM mall is big but the ratio of mall goers to parking lot is not enough to accommodate the county's population. Chili's food is not really my kind of food. Because I have to walk farther at the state that I was in, I felt Chili's gave a chill for a nacho chips, etc...; the food I can't remember was not enough to keep me adjusted from my uncool attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20

Kamilah K.,"Baltimore, MD",166,192,127,4.0,4/16/2013,"Piggy-backing on the Element hotel review, 4 friends and I went to Chilli's too. The line was long but luckily one of my friends spotted an area parallel to the bar. We bypassed the line and sat down within 2 minutes. I'm sure some people were mad but it is technically a bar area. Note: that space is small, so if you are clumsy (like myself) be careul not spill your drink on your self (like I did). .I ordered the BBQ burger with a veggie burger and the mac and cheese in lieu of fried. The burger was kind of dry but it was good. The presidente margarita helped. That margarita was great. I felt buzzed in no time. I cannot comment on how long the food took since I had to run into the mall for a new pair of pants. The pricing was reasonable and I would come back for a causal hangout.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20
Mick G.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,1.0,5/28/2012,"Since this is a chain restaurant, my review will be based on their service. The food at Chili's is relatively good and it's pretty much the same at every location. My girlfriend and I came up to the host's booth. One of the hostesses came up to the booth to pick up a menu for someone that was already seated. She looked at us and didn't say anything. Another hostess came and sat us down. We were seated and checked out the menu. We noticed no one came to our table for about 5-7 minutes. By that time, we were ready to order our drinks, appetizer, and meal. No one came to say, ""I'll be right with you"". My girlfriend said, ""I'm going to give them 2 minutes and we're walking out."" So being the geek I am, I set my sportswatch for 2 minutes. Low and behold, our server came and my timer went off simultaneously. Our server says, ""Oh my, how long have you guys been sitting here?"" We told her about 7 minutes tops. She apologizes. My girlfriend didn't want to stay. Since she just beat the timer, I gave her a chance to redeem herself. Big mistake. Our server didn't seem to want to redeem herself. I was hoping to hear her say, ""well since you guys we're patient, I will take off the beer or appetizer off your bill."" She didn't do anything to make up for her mistake. She didn't give us plates with our appetizer. She didn't refill our waters.  We just decided to pay for our meals and only tipping her a buck and some change. blah. ...on to the next.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20

Mix drinks were ok but not the greatest. If this place wasn't so expensive I would have given it a 3 star review but they want to much for the quality of food.

Nathan C.,"Severn, MD",95,388,29,2.0,2/20/2009,"Chili's is your general American chain restaurant; burgers, chicken, salads, you get the picture.  Nothing to write home about, really.  So why am I writing this review? I usually get fajitas at Chili's because they're hard to screw up.  I should have stuck to that plan. Today I decided to get a burger.  Now, I didn't get the (deep breath) ""Smokehouse Bacon Triple-The-Cheese Big Mouth Burger"" (12 syllables, 143 calories per syllable).  Instead I got the ""Southern Smokehouse Bacon Big Mouth Burger"" (10 syllables, 161 calories per syllable). It was like the Soviet Russia Planned Economy version of a burger.  All the bits were there, and they were in the right order, but I don't think I've ever had a burger with less character than this.  It didn't even have enough decency to just suck.  Just a mound of burger-shaped stuff on a plate. Service was friendly but the kitchen took a long time (at 11:15, no less) to get our food out.
