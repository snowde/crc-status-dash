Laura Z.,"Camp Hill, PA",7,2,,3.0,1/10/2018,Got there right at noon. Got served barely warm coffee. Had to ask for it to be heated so waited for fresh. Staff was nice otherwise. Don t like the new way the fajitas are served in foil.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Steve S.,"Panama City, FL",86,116,70,4.0,3/4/2017,"This is the best Chilis I've ever been to. Far and above the rest!  If you're in the area and want a good place to grab a quick bite, I highly recommend this location!  The bartenders take care of you. They are not at all stingy with the liquor. The wait staff is excellent as well.   It sits across from a Target and a strip mall, it's sort of hidden away in a little valley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Ashley R.,"Harrisburg, PA",278,116,159,3.0,1/8/2017,Pretty good food here. We always get the two for twenty menu. Need to sit in the bar area for happy hour it doesn't apply to the whole restaurant. They take Plenti points which is good too. Sometimes service is a bit slow but food usually tastes pretty good. We will continue to go back there especially for happy hour in the bar area! Good for groups and fast lunch from their inexpensive lunch menu!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Eugene H.,"Midtown, Harrisburg, PA",368,10,,4.0,12/6/2017,"Been to this chili's twice recently. Burger is a good bet and nachos are excellent. Manager, Ginger is very interested in making sure guests are happy. One of the few chains that's trying to do it right. Fries are super tasty but there could be a few more of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Byron S.,"New Market, MD",17,10,1,1.0,8/4/2017,"Stopped in for a late lunch and sat at the bar.  It seemed like there wasn't enough servers working to cover the few tables and patrons at the bar.  I left after about 15 minutes because no employee cared to take my food order, or even explained that they were busy and would be with me shortly.  I felt neglected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Ricki L.,"Harrisburg, PA",3,3,,1.0,11/17/2017,Went to Chili's for dinner tonight had a very bad experience first of all there was three adults and two children in our party they seated us at a small table while they seated a single woman with two kids had a table double the size of ours took almost 40 minutes to get our food the salads came out 20 minutes after the cooked Foods we had to keep our waitress for drink refills and for other things that we were missing from our meals manager came over we explain to him what was happening he gave icj $5 gift card we started at 10 minutes of 7 trying to pay our bills which they did not have split correctly manager came back again and we explained to him that we would not be returning to the restaurant anymore we gave him the gift cards back he cleared the rest of the bills that we never got to pay and we went on our way just seems like the last few times we've gone there it's been a horrible experience needless to say we will never go back again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Rose M.,"Washington, DC",0,80,36,3.0,5/15/2017,"I'm a Chili's fan! Unfortunately, a lot of the Chili's in my area have closed down in the last couple of years and had not been to one in a long time. This past weekend, while in PA, we decided to dine at a Chili's in Harrisburg. I was a bit disappointed. It was not too busy, but yet, the service was very slow. We waiting a while to be seated, who knows where the hostess was. Then waited a log while before they took our order. I did enjoy my buffalo boneless chicken wings and a premium margarita! I just wish the service would have been better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Deric L.,"Harrisburg, PA",4,25,6,3.0,7/27/2016,"Alright, I'm not much of a sit-down chain restaurant fan, but I am not a snob, either. That said, since I am hungry and bored, here goes. Early Wednesday evening. Dining area's half-full and bar mostly empty. Sat at bar. Bartender had stepped away, but showed up very quickly. She was polite and efficient. First thing I noticed was the bar top. Something's wrong. It feels sticky. Unclean? No ... wait, something's going on with the varnish. In the late-afternoon / very early evening light, I can see the problem. It's either picked up, pilled like clothes get, or has attracted a lot of fuzz from bar rags. Either way, it looks like hell and needs redone (for the record, two beers in, I no longer noticed). Got the smokehouse-whatever burger -- ground beef, fried onions (onion rings) and barbecue sauce. Looked bea-utiful; tasted alright. Probably a tad overdone, but the bacon meant business, serious-looking and thick. Every once in awhile, tasted black pepper ... yum! Fries were serviceable, but unremarkable. Liked the side sliced pickles with garlic and peppercorns; very nice touch. Beer -- Tröeg's Perpetual! -- did the trick. Mustn't have been cold enough from the tap, though -- got it in a chilled tall mug and it was a bit warm for the first-third. The rest was all-good, since the mug worked its magic. Would come back, but only with a friend who wanted to. Probably would've been the same experience at any other chain ... Gotta hand it to them on the local microbrew option. Did the trick ... Yes, sir, did the trick. P.S. The music was blah ... right until it was time to leave and the Cars came on! Let the good times roll ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Rosemary M.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,25,,5.0,3/18/2017,Love Chili's. Husband and I have been here quite a few times.    The food is always good as is the service.   Appetizers - the White Spinach Queso is very good as is the Loaded White Queso.    The Smokehouse Combo is excellent as are the burgers and the Sirloin Steak.   Entire place is clean.    Everything positive at the High Pointe Blvd Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Sheelini M.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,3,,1.0,8/12/2017,"This is the worst chilis location in the chain. Always! The staff is one of the worst we've ever seen and you would be lucky if they didn't mess up your food. I have complained multiple times with no effect. The latest incident - We ordered our food at 8:30 and were here exactly at 9:00 (paid at 9:06 receipt as proof) to pick it up which was listed as the pick up time on our order. We were made to wait till 9:45 to get our order. When I asked them why, the excuse that the manager had was that the food went cold because some of it was taken out and and some was left in the kitchen. We could have driven to the location in Mechanicsburg - 10 miles away, dined in and gotten out in the time it took us to get our food here! Go there. It's worth the wait!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Lynn F.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,10,,2.0,8/7/2017,"Went to Chili's on 07/29/12017 around noon.  Service was ok.  Got soup and salad.  Potato soup tasted burnt so I didn't bother getting more.  Server did ask if I wanted to try another soup. Grandson got ""Kid mac & cheese.  I believe it was nothing more that Kraft mac & cheese but was charged $5.20.  Son got burger which he said was ok but fries were soggy.  I was very excited to go to a Chili's but was extremely disappointed and will probably not go there again.  Skip this place and go next door to Friendly's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Justin W.,"Harrisburg, PA",41,52,5,3.0,4/1/2016,"We came here for dinner this past Sunday. As Chilies was one of the only places open on holiday in a smallish town.  It wasn't crowded.  We had our choice of seats at the bar.    I ordered prime rib tacos with out cheese (of course). My order came out in a reasonable time.  Our Bar Tender / waiter was cool. Good service. We were satisfied with our overall experience, and  Would consider coming back next Easter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Jennifer S.,"Lancaster, PA",49,17,9,4.0,9/16/2016,Always great food and service no matter which chilli's we choose but this is our favorite stop on our way to ride the quads!!! Loving the chicken tortilla soup as well as the ribs! Yummy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2

Bea G.,"Highspire, PA",16,2,,1.0,9/7/2016,"Won't eat here again. Went to lunch with friends and got the Caribbean Salad. It was good until I got near the bottom of the bowl. I found chunks of lettuce that were brown and nasty. I showed it to the waitress and she brought the manager over. The manager offered another smaller salad, since I had eaten most of it. Really, like I could eat anything after seeing that nasty mess in my bowl. Unfortunately I must have inadvertently eaten some of it, or something else that was bad, because I didn't even make it home before my stomach rebelled. Can I tell you what a mess l had? Not to mention that the manager only gave me $2.00 off my bill. Chili's is definitely off my list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Jason T.,"Manhattan, KS",6,7,13,3.0,4/30/2016,"Manager, insisted on getting us fresh food after food being warm upon arrival. I stated I will be good. He was courteous and very respective of our wished.  Great place just needs to be swept up through out the day. Crumbs all around the bar area.  The place will have to improve before I return. Manager on April 30 was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2

Timothy B.,"Laurel, MD",0,31,19,2.0,9/27/2014,"Service wasn't terrible, but we didn't particularly feel like we were paid a lot of attention to.  Also bothered my daughter that our waiter's pants were halfway down his butt while he was working. The food was either bland and overcooked or bland and soggy.  A soft taco disintegrated when picked up because it was so soggy.  Cheese in quesadillas was completely baked in and dried out. The floor under our table hadn't been cleaned before we arrived, and the bathrooms weren't well maintained.   The manager did comp one of the seven meals we ordered, and provided three coupons for free kids meals. Not a good experience.  Chili's is a sub-par chain anyway, but this is a sub-par chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2
Ralf S.,"State College, PA",98,43,7,4.0,3/17/2015,"Chili's restaurants are iffy at best, depending on which one you visit. This visit at this visit was exceptional..

Margy C.,"Camp Hill, PA",0,2,1,1.0,10/14/2014,"Hostess put us in between two large and loud tables. Ordered two mango iced teas - they came in about five minutes. We ordered food in another five minutes: a burger and chicken sandwich...and 35 minutes later, the food finally arrived. My boyfriend's fries were crisp and fresh, mine were old and limp. Burger and sandwich were the only saving grace of this visit. Waiter asked if I wanted a tea and I said I did, he came back in ten minutes to ask again if I wanted a tea refill as if it was the first time he had asked. We won't be back anytime soon. Slow service ruined it for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2?start=20
Alicia B.,"Jersey Shore, PA",0,1,,5.0,3/20/2016,Best experience ever! This Chili's is great! There is a waiter named Keith there that was so attentive and brought our drinks and chips/salsa refills before we even had to ask. He was so great with our kids that it was like going out for dinner and entertainment! My kids even wanted a picture with him so they could always remember him! Best waiter ever!

Charles V.,"Martinez, CA",12,91,,2.0,12/31/2011,"Never been a fan of this place, but some friends really wanted to go here.  Highlight was my margarita which wasn't strong enough.   Host tried to seat our African American with a different African American family so she was a little offended when she showed up a little late to join our table and was showed to a table with people she didn't know. Waiter was bad too.  We ordered appetizers, drinks, and dinner, and he insisted he would remember it all at our table.  Of course he didn't....boneless wings turned into buffalo wings with bone...my request for no cheese because I'm allergic was halfway met on account of my steamed broccoli being covered in cheese.  He never asked us if we wanted water.  He kept pushing alcohol and soda, which is what servers are supposed to do I guess. I don't go to Chili's because the food is sub par, drinks are meh for the price, and the service has always been lackluster.  I did give the bartender a 20% tip because she was efficient and helpful.  My friend didn't even leave a tip for the server because of all the errors he made.  I mean the guy even took our food away before we were finished eating it.  Hopefully my friends won't drag me back to Chili's anytime soon after this meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2?start=20
Nhung T.,"Oakland, CA",208,773,,2.0,5/11/2011,"So my timing was all off because I'm from the west coast. Therefore, I wanted a salad- it was actually dinner time. I ordered the Quesadilla Explosion Salad, my usual with margarita of course. The salad was horrible because half way into the salad, I realized that the chicken was a little raw. I didn't complain because I finished the salad itself already. Also the Quesadilla was a little hard. However, great customer service even though I'm the only Asian person in there :-).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2?start=20
Leigh N.,"Orlando, FL",48,169,8,4.0,9/23/2010,I have always been a fan of Chili's... I usually eat the Southwest Egg Rolls as my main dish because they are so huge and fill me up... they also go very well with my drink of choice and #1 reason I go to Chili's.. the El Presidente Margarita. I have been to this location dozens of times and I have never had any problems.  The staff is friendly and the prices are decent.  The only thing I miss about the one in San Antonio is Happy Hour.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2?start=20
Donald S.,"Mt Joy, PA",0,15,,1.0,4/29/2012,"If you not from around here, this place was very hard to find on yelp.

J R.,"Harrisburg, PA",5,265,,3.0,1/29/2011,"burger and sandwich were good. The fries had an odd taste to me but my wife said they tasted fine.

Ali R.,"Austin, TX",8,35,,1.0,11/19/2012,"Arrived at 5:45 on Saturday night with a party of 2 others, waited about 20 minutes for a table. The place was packed. My party was finally seated, waitress arrived promptly to tell us she'd be taking care of us and someone else might also be taking care of us (we never saw the other server.) She takes our drink & appetizer order. We waited quite awhile for the drinks to arrive, 10-15 minutes. We put our food order in and waited. Appetizers arrived. Chips & guac were okay (the best part of the meal, along with my margarita.)  We ordered 2 orders of chips & guacamole for the table and my friend ordered the fried cheese. Fried cheese was lukewarm and generally bland & sad looking. Another friend arrived to join us. We ordered a refill on our chips.  We waited some more. Our table had time to eat 3 baskets of chips and salsa while we waited. The place had cleared out by now, the table next to us arrived 15 minutes after we did, got their food and left before ours even arrived. It was close to 7:15 at this point and our waitress stopped by to tell us our food should be out soon. Waited another 10 minutes. Food finally arrived. My friend's boneless wings were cold. Mine & my friend's black bean burgers were both room temp. The only thing hot was the fries. Nothing was hot or had  flavor. I ordered 2 margaritas and they cost $18?! Finally left at close to 8 pm, 2 hours after we arrived. I don't think so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2?start=20
Mia K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",235,497,18,3.0,1/7/2008,"""No liquor today,"" Mia said sitting down at the table. She looked down at the menu. ""I'll have a tropical sunrise Margarita and a glass of water please,"" she said smiling devilishly. She looked down at the table and blushed. ""It doesn't count when there's fruit in it,"" Mia said. The waiter arrived with a margarita, sans water.  ""Whatever,"" she thought.  ""I'll survive."" Next came the fried mozzarella, served with a delicious marinara containing chunks of fresh tomato.  Fantastic. And the main course?  Grilled Shrimp Alfredo - and another request for water.  The shrimp was a bit over-grilled, which detracted from the shrimpy goodness, but still very good. Al fin - after my 3rd request I finally got water, and I was too stuffed to eat cheesecake for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisburg-2?start=20
