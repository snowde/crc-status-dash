Diane M.,"Citrus Heights, CA",20,4,8,4.0,9/13/2017,My sister and I went in and sat at the bar to grap some lunch to go. We decided we'd have time to drink a margarita and  decided on the blackBerry flavor. (Yes...those are fresh blueberries in the glass just to make it look pretty. But they were good and went perfect with the blackberry flavor.) We were surprised when our waitress brought out a tiny glass and a large shaker that held the rest. It was DELICIOUS! So...we both decided it would take awhile to finish the 1 margarita so we ordered the chicken bacon ranch quesadilla with Anjo chili sauce and split it. OMG...we were both in heaven. We had beat the lunch crowd so it wasn't too busy yet. Our waitress was so much fun. She gave us superb service and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit there. I'm visiting Utah right now but hope to go back to that same Chili's before I go home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Effy C.,"Ogden, UT",0,3,1,1.0,8/26/2017,My son's Mac and cheese was gross. No taste. My husbands chicken sandwich was gross. My Chipotle honey waffles was sloop grosss!!!!!!! I remembered that I liked it as a kid. But what was I thinking! The waitress was really nice and the hostess was super nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Kellie K.,"Ogden, UT",75,15,2,1.0,8/22/2017,"The food was awful! The chicken in my fajitas and the mango chicken my husband ordered was rubbery. Chili's food has definitely gone down hill.  The chips and salsa weren't even good.  Maybe if chili's quit changing their menu, they might be able to get back to making quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Sarah T.,"Tempe, AZ",0,6,1,5.0,8/9/2017,"This chilis is consistently good. We live nearby and keep coming back. Southwest egg rolls are one of our favorite appetizers and I usually get the smokehouse burger. It's awesome that they have a variety of meat and meatless patty options. They rotate through local craft beers so there is usually something new and interesting to drink and the people are very very friendly. Even though this is a chain and I rarely patronize chain establishments, I make an exception for this chilis because the food is just delicious and service is consistently great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Penny L.,"Ogden, UT",0,22,,5.0,2/20/2017,Another great dinner at Chili's. The food was great and Heather was super friendly. We loved jiving to the 70s rock. This location is a bit of a drive but always worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Nancy B.,"Harrisville, UT",5,1,,1.0,7/26/2017,"My husband and I went to the Harrisville restaurant around 3:00 today . There was a lady sweeping the floor on one side and motioned for us to sit on the other side wherever we wanted. There was no clean booths so we sat down at one that had been cleared but not wiped off. The  only person working was behind the bar and totally ignored us. We sat and waited at least 10 - 15 minutes with no acknowledgment. We finally just left, we have been to other Chilis and have always had good service. We just recently moved to North Ogden and will not be going back to the Harrisville Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Patricia C.,"Ogden, UT",0,1,,1.0,2/5/2017,"I ordered the appetizer trio to take to a party--buffalo wings, southwest egg rolls, fried cheddar cheese. I was embarrassed--the egg rolls were not cut, the wings were burned and the pieces of cheese were about the size of an m & m. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Ryan S.,"Ogden, UT",0,23,11,1.0,9/17/2014,"Chili's- just another chain restaurant that tastes like they microwave the majority of the food.  There is no flavor for almost all of the dishes, other than too much salt. There seems to be an attempt to offset this by giving ridiculously large portions of food. I think the only raw product in the place is the beef patty, and its a standard burger, albeit dressed up and priced up. People seem to like the chips and salsa, but they just don't do it for me. Salsa is runny and bland, and the chips are quick fried again before serving which makes them greasy, its a great combo for heartburn an hour or two after the rest of your meal. Families seem to like these places, but I just don't get it. They seem like a fancier dining version of Fast Food, find a local place (check my reviews) for good quality, from scratch cooking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Kevin P.,"Ogden, UT",4,85,18,2.0,11/18/2013,"I must say, this review is specifically for the To-Go aspect of this Chili's.  We ordered food for our family of 3 a few weeks back, and we decided to try it through the To-Go service for the first time.  Ordering online was awesome.  Very easy and very convenient.   The food however, is clearly prepared with a different mentality than if you eat in.  I ordered their chicken crispers.  One of them was a small nugget, one was so thin that about a 3rd of it contained no meat whatsoever, and was nothing more than dry, hard fried batter.  I've NEVER been dissapointed in these crispers when we eat in.  So the moral of the story is to never order their to-go because they'll give you their garbage product because they know you wont notice until you're far away.  I took multiple pics and sent them to Chilis on Twitter to see what the deal was, and they promised to mail me something to make up for it.  Well that was the end of it and I haven't seen anything for over a month.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Ken H.,"Pleasant View, UT",45,28,4,1.0,2/17/2015,"I been waiting to write this cause it's not gonna be good. The last couple times I have been there we walk out and I say "" I'm never going back!""  Well we went back and it totally lived up to the very low expectations I have. I had to return a burger because it was not even warm. I mean it was room temperature. That place can count on NEVER seeing us again. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Jayne F.,"Anacortes, WA",8,79,7,1.0,8/6/2014,"This is our first and last time at this Chili's. We were here for lunch, and a bit pressed for time.  We didn't want to order something that would take too long.  I ordered a margherita mexi bowl, after asking the waitress what it was.  She said it was chicken with beans, rice and a tiny bit of lettuce.  That came with a side, so I chose a house salad.  The salad was filled with too many lettuce ribs.  Then the strange mexi bowl, kind of a salad, with additional ribs of lettuce, few actual lettuce leaves, two dry, partially black avocado slices.  Inedible.  The mexi bowl also had watery beans, corn and rice.  There was a good amount of liquid in the bottom of the bowl.  Strange.  So I basically ordered two salads, both disappointing.  Teach your kitchen staff how to prep a salad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
C Brandon H.,"Ogden, UT",8,7,,1.0,1/11/2014,Walked in about 11:45 on a Saturday and waited for 10 minutes.  Servers and other employees looked at me and just ignored us.  Nobody even offered to seat us.  Finally we just left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Brian T.,"Ogden, UT",1,40,,4.0,10/31/2012,"I haven't been to a Chili's that isn't any different from another... Cookie cutter response- The food is above average-not the greatest, but certainly not bad. Nice seasoning on steaks, fajitas, ribs, sprimp, whatever. Appetizers are good, though seem to be trending smaller, which is a good thing I guess, except the price isn't reflecting the change, lol. I like that they show sports within eye-sight of most tables so you can keep up with your team(if it happpens to be on) whilst taking the fam out. Usually clean, but can get a little sketchy on busy weekends",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Abigail B.,"Ogden, UT",9,199,11,4.0,5/30/2013,Good food here for reasonable prices! I like their burgers and chicken.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Jake P.,"Brigham City, UT",29,46,7,3.0,5/14/2013,Pretty standard Chilis set up.  I will give this place 3 stars because Chilis chips and salsa are just that good.  I love the chips!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
Shane Z.,"Willard, UT",56,340,48,5.0,3/22/2011,"Lunch time is awesome at Chili's!  I always get the Bottomless express lunch, chips and salsa, followed with a Salad and Soup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harrisville-2
