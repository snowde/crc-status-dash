connie h.,"New Orleans, LA",0,14,5,4.0,10/13/2017,To go order was accurate - my fault I guess I should have told them burger well done because I had to finish cooking it in microwave when I got home  - but in my defense there was not a area online to make this selection  One other thing we ordered the chocolate Melton cake for dessert and the cake taste like the freezer and the ice cream not to hot either ( not fresh at all ) But online ordering was easy- I just wish I could have made specific instructions to items- they make you call the store- really that part was not easy- one because nothing asked how I wanted my burger cooked,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey
Justin B.,"Marrero, LA",290,43,196,2.0,8/3/2017,"The beautiful wifey and i attended this fine establishment just as they opened for lunch. Upon walking inside we were not greeted at the door and was left unattended for a few minutes. The female bartended observed us waiting patiently and attended to us. The female bartender seated us, got our drink orders and our food order. She was very nice and attentive as she ran the whole show, seating people, taking orders, bringing out orders and making drinks.  The food came out quick and was ok (its Chilis, lol). After eating we left a generous tip for the overworked lady and gave praise for her job well done. Yelpers, take care of your servers !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey
Eunice A.,"Sulphur, LA",6,40,28,3.0,10/25/2017,"We went in about an hour before they close which gave us plenty of time to eat..  Well you would think but nope!   We had to wait probably 10 minutes before someone came to take our drink order.  Probably another minutes wait to place our order.  .  We finally get our meal, steak was cooked like we asked for so the ONE time the waitress came by to see how everything was we told her and showed her our steaks.  Sorry but I don't eat bloody steak and blood was all over my plate.  She offered to take it to the back but we decided not to because we were tired and was ready to go plus it was closing time for them.   I was disappointed on the service and food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey

Christina C.,"New Orleans, LA",77,74,86,2.0,10/28/2016,"This place was typical fast food chain restaurant, with a heavy price tag.

Andrew I.,"Miramar, San Diego, CA",128,2,,2.0,8/24/2017,"We frequently go to different Chilis as I used to travel quite often and we like the repeatability that this chain typically offers.  We ordered the $35 meal for two and we were pretty disappointed with this location.  The presidente margaritas tasted like Gatorade that I would mix at home with very little alcohol.  Then we got our meals which we had mixed feelings about.  The HC chicken crispers were spot on and the rare steak was as expected.  The broccoli I recieved was loaded down with salt and pepper whereas the broccoli my wife recieved had no salt at all on it.  Overall, I would say the food was sub par to a typical chilis and the wait was much longer.  Honestly, I'm not too sure if I will return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey

Lynette M.,"Upland, CA",0,8,1,5.0,7/8/2017,"So.... sometimes you just have to take a chance!   The reviews were bad but we love Chili's in California so we didn't figure it would be so bad here. I read the reviews and I was quite hesitant but we had a big group and there was no wait. Our waitress whose name I wish I could remember was awesome. She treated each of us with a smile and a lot of patience for my grandparents who are a little bit slow. The food was as great as it was in California. It took a little while to get to us considering there weren't too many people in the restaurant, but that's okay. It was Margarita Thursday and we were busy sipping on those. Sometimes I think it's all perspective. Give this place a try again and have a mango margarita if you get a chance. Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey
Andrew N.,"Gretna, LA",346,70,36,1.0,5/29/2016,"Did not enjoy the food here one bit! Personally, rarely do I ever go to these franchise-type of diners, but since my cousin insisted us to go to try out the burgers, I was like why not. We started off with the white spinach cheese dip with our chips, and to be bluntly, it tasted awful! Barely any spinach at all with one single piece of asparagus hidden somewhere in the cheese. The guacamole was apparently a single slice of avocado that wasn't even mixed well with the pico de gallo, not to mention there was barely any pico de gallo and guac. The cheese itself was all liquid and not creamy at all. The complimentary salsa tasted better than this spinach cheese dip that nearly cost us $7. We then got the sweet and smoky burger and the southern style hamburger with a side of onion rings for one of them, which at first glance looked tasty but was not the case at all. Each burger was super dry, like one of the driest burgers I have ever tasted and was borderline burnt. The fries and onion rings had no flavor to them whatsoever, and it was like the cook just put them in the fryer. Like really? I can just go to Walmart, buy some fries and onion rings, and do that myself for much cheaper.  At the end, our bill was almost $37 for two burgers with a side of onion rings for one of them ($1 extra), white spinach cheese dip, and a coke; which is one RIDICULOUS bill that should have been under $30 for the quality of food we were getting. On the plus side, our server was very at tentative and nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey
Anthoneshia D.,"Marrero, LA",38,154,79,1.0,11/7/2016,I was an employee here once upon a time ago and the managers were racist and showed favoritism and I heard it is still like that but they show more favoritism toward the people with seniority.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey

Delmy O.,"Bakersfield, CA",22,31,81,1.0,3/10/2016,I did not enjoy my food. Let me say California my home and Louisiana are completely different. Everything tastes different.

Against my will, I was forced to come here. My manfriend likes what's convenient. Chili's was open late on the westbank. Ah, perfect.  But you know what, I was satisfied. They revamped their menu, like many other chain restaurants, & they're doing a good job. There's seasonal promotions which combines good eats for a pretty decent price.  I really don't remember what I ordered but I remember it being good enough that I packed my leftovers and ate it the next day.  I don't come to franchise restaurants expecting a five course meal with the fanciest ingredients. I just want two things: decent food & good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey

We ordered steak with mash potatoes and chicken bacon ranch quesadillas. Steak was ordered medium rare and came out well done. Wow, that's quite a difference. The steak wasn't even hot, more like disgustingly luke-warm. Mash potatoes straight up cold. Do managers even exist here? Chicken bacon quesadilla was impressively stuffed but unimpressively tasteless.  I had a free coupon for dessert which is and always will be the main reason why I go to this establishment. Ice cream was freezer burnt - having me eat ice crystals with every bite. Ice cream to cake ratio ridiculously out of portion and obviously frozen and microwaved before served.

Reyna C.,"New Orleans, LA",91,134,112,5.0,12/22/2014,"What the stuff?! A five star review?! HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?! Well let me tell you how! A friend and I were on our way to ihop when he decided that he was in the mood for dinner (it's called IHOP cmon lol). Anyways we decided that we should go somewhere else and my friend mentioned that Chili's is right next door (commence cringing). I settled down and walked sulkily to what I presumed would be ANOTHER bad experience. We were seated as soon as we came in and noticed this new gadget thing-a-mahoosit on the table (looks like an android tablet with a slot for sliding credit cards). Our waiter explained to us that they have a brand new system where we can order whatever we want on the touch screen, order refills of our drink, and finally pay with a credit/debit card whenever we are ready. We end up getting the 2 for 20.  Southwestern Eggrolls: i never would have ordered this because I don't like eggrolls but this was pretty delicious and was the perfect size to share. The wrapper is not wonton like I thought it would be, turned out to be a flour tortilla stuffed with succulent chicken, black beans, corn, some sort of white cheese, and spinach. Honestly could have eaten this as an entree! Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers: my friend had gotten this last time and she tore them up so I decided I wanted to try some. A little salty for my taste (not a huge fan of salt, most people would probably enjoy it) but bursting with flavor. Deeeelicious ! This came with two sides of my choice. So I chose a side salad and southwestern mac n cheese. Both are $1 extra. Southwestern Mac n Cheese: Was topped with crunchy bread crumbs, had a bit of a spicy kick(just a pinch. nothing a child couldn't handle). I believe this had bacon but I'm not completely sure. Worth the extra $1 Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadillas: Friend ordered this and we ended up splitting everything. They were pretty good, they didn't skimp on any of the ingredients like a taco bell or other fast food establishment and it's a huge size!  Ran out of room so we had no dessert, had to bring most of it home in a to go box. Another thing worth mentioning is that our server is ""DA BEST"". I've never had service comparable to his ever before. He was very attentive and kept our drinks full. Very surprised to find him at a Chili's of all places (said he used to work at TGI, go figure). Anyway this one meal has turned me into a believer. Will be back but they need to re-vamp the dessert menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey?start=20

Darkskin B.,"New Orleans, LA",23,28,68,5.0,11/5/2014,"I must say, compared to my past experiences with this place, this time was completely different. I met co workers at the bar to have drinks.

Amber W.,"New Orleans, LA",13,19,109,2.0,7/11/2014,I've visited this location many times but it is definitely going downhill just bc of the slow service. My last visit I went with a friend & my daughter. We were seated right away & got our drinks. Another party sat at the table next to us about 10 minutes later. That group was done with their food & paid their bill while we were still waiting on our food. The waitress apologized but they really need to get their act together.

Sierra T.,"Harvey, LA",1,17,4,1.0,1/7/2016,"This is a complaint solely based on the bartender named Mika I went here with a friend last night, around 9 o'clock. We stood at the front door for a long time and no one ever came. Maybe there was a host on duty, maybe there wasn't, but many servers saw us standing there, so they could've seated us themselves or told us to have a seat anywhere or SOMETHING. Don't look at customers standing at the  front door and just leave them there.  Whatever, we obviously got tired of standing, so we just took a seat at the bar. There were two other people sitting at the bar which meant the bartender now had 4 people total to take care of. It took her about 7 minutes to come greet us and take our drink orders. For anyone that thinks 7 minutes isn't a long time, of course in most day to day life situations it isn't. But I'm sure everyone can agree that when you're sitting at a restaurant hungry and waiting to be served, time stretches on much longer. Especially when you're watching the person that's supposed to be serving you behind that bar cleaning up and moving around crates of glasses. Apparently she was trying to get a head start on her closing duties and that was way more important than the guests that she definitely saw sitting at the bar.  When she finally came over to us, she didn't introduce herself, but she took our drink orders. My friend got a regular Arnold Palmer, I got a strawberry AP. The drinks came out quickly; mine tasted like a strawberry lemonade rather than a strawberry Arnold Palmer, but I wasn't that bothered by that. She takes our app orders. We told her that was all we wanted for now and still wanted to look at the menu for entrees. Literally the only thing that she did right during this entire visit was when my friend asked for his loaded baked potato soup to be fresh, she ran to the kitchen and got him a bowl from the new batch that they had just put out. Someone else ran my food to me and she never came check on us to ask if we were ok or to refill drinks. I actually started eating the ice. I also noticed the man sitting across the bar from us had received his food, but didn't have silverware to eat with! That should've been one of the first things she laid down in front of every guest. As I said earlier, apparently washing her dishes and restocking her fridge was so important that she couldn't even periodically do a quick scan of the bar to make sure every guest was ok. I guest that man didn't want to yell across the bar to get her attention, but my friend didn't mind, so he called her and directed her attention to the man. He was grateful to us.  As I said, we told her that we were going to order more food. That never happened. She never looked up to see that I had received my appetizer. She never refilled either of our drinks. She never came back at all. The only guest that received any attention was the one that was sitting nearest her little sink washing station because she was faced that way the entire time.  In the end, I told my friend we would find more food somewhere else because I was still hungry, but I refused to tolerate that service. When she dropped the checks, she told my friend that she charged him for the bowl of soup with an entree rather than a regular bowl of soup so it would be cheaper. Why she did that, I have no idea. Maybe that was a final push to save her tip. Sorry, didn't work. I usually tip around 40-50%. Servers make $2 or $3 bucks an hour; they need and deserve it. Mika only deserved the 15% that I gave her.  WAIT! Thats not it. After reading this entire review, let me tell you what REALLY pissed me off. After my friend had to call her over once again to get our checks, she said ""thats all you're getting? Aw man, I was waiting on you guys to order more!"" Are you kidding me Mika?? You must be joking. You knew we wanted more food, you were supposedly waiting on us to order more food, but HOW COULD WE ORDER MORE FOOD IF YOU NEVER CAME BACK?!?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey?start=20

King F.,"Houston, TX",16,3,9,2.0,7/22/2013,"0.5 Star for service. 2.5 Stars for Food. Average = 1.5 stars. We visited the restaurant on a weekday for dinner. We arrived at about 5:30 pm. We went there because we've got a free flatbread appetizer coupon. However, the waiter said we had to order an entree to make the coupon valid. And the $20 combo meal we ordered did not count even though the coupon explicitly said no purchase was necessary. He was pretty rude about it. Ended up we had to order another salad. That was not it... Our food took forever. It ended up took us 45 minutes. Some people came in later than us finished theirs already while we were still waiting for our food. The waiter excused that it was because of the abnormal longer baking time of the flatbread. But then the minute we complained, he brought our food out 2 minutes later. I was not sure if they were lack of waiter/waitress. When we first sat down we weren't served with drinks. When we asked for silverwares they could forget about it. So it took us another 10 minutes before we could eat. Ridiculous!! As far as the quality of the food, the gorgonzola salad was great! That was the best dish during that visit. The California Chicken flatbread was ok except it was lack of toppings. I meant there were only about 2-3 pieces of chicken and avocado on the flatbread. If it was not free, we probably would not order it for $9.95. Ended up the manager came around because we complained about the food came out slow. He tried to make it up for us by giving us back the free flatbread coupon and making the flatbread free-of-charge. Seriously, why would I want my coupon back when we would never come back again? Something that was initially ""free"" now become ""free"" to us.. how generous!!  In the end, we spend 1.5 hours in this Chili's during that visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey?start=20
Mandy G.,"San Francisco, CA",586,317,673,3.0,7/25/2013,"I don't know why this place has such low ratings but I personally think it deserves a 3 at most.  It's located right by a shopping area next to canes. Parking is easy to find as it is in a private lot. Upon opening the front doors, there's a little bench area/""lobby"" that you go through to go through a next set of doors to the restaurant itself. I noticed that the bench was dusty or dirty.. so it isn't too clean I guess. Now entering into the restaurant itself, there was two groups in front of us. After us, there was another two groups that came in. As the previous reviewers wrote, the service is slow. When we came in, there was no hostess around. It took her 3-5 minutes to come to the front to finally start seating people (the 2 groups in front of us). When we were seated, it wasn't too long before our waitress came to take our drink/food orders.  I've eaten here a few times before back in California and maybe once here in the same location. My food experience is the same as usual. My friend and I ordered the 2 for $20 deal (2 entrees and 1 appetizer) - good deal! We both ordered the Honey Chipotle Chicken Strippers. It's a bit spicy but it was good! It came with the chicken strips, a cob of corn peppered (yums!), and fries. Our waitress checked on us a few times so her service was okay I guess. I found it weird that when she came to refill our drinks, she ended up pouring the drink into our cups from another (filled) cup. Usually the waiters I experience with just gives me a new (filled) cup and take away my old one.  Knocked off one star for slow customer service and another for it not being too clean I guess. I personally just think it was an A-OK experience. There's also a bar side to this restaurant on the right side. There's happy hours I think later at night, forgot the times.

Danon H.,"New Orleans, LA",178,338,1024,1.0,7/2/2012,"Usually I don't ever give a chain restaurant a review. But in this case I will make an exception. I came here because this one woman I was dating at the time really wanted to go. The service in this place absolutely stinks. It took forever for the hostess to come around. Then when we got seated the waitress only came around to our table only 4 times even though the place wasn't very busy. When we got the food it was cold and wasn't done all the way. Another thing that someone else pointed out was the whole racism issue. I guess part of the reason I got such shabby treatment was because the woman I was with had a different skin color than me. I think that is pretty messed up personally. This is the 21st century and NOT the 1940's,But it is what it is. I am sure that not all chilli's restaurants are this bad.

Tyler D.,"Winthrop Harbor, IL",0,10,1,1.0,9/17/2015,The server was nice but slow. The real problem was the cook. My chicken came out way undercooked. It was disgusting to look at.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey?start=20
Benicia M.,"Harvey, LA",0,2,,5.0,4/13/2015,"Chili's is a restaurant that serves a variety of food. Chili's serves things such as sandwiches, burgers, fajita's, ribs and steaks, pasta, and many other foods. I decided to go to Chili's with a friend to evaluate their food, service, environment, and my overall experience. I discovered that the food at Chili's is big portioned, priced well, and delicious. Their servers are very nice and polite, but busy. Chili's environment was nice as well. Chili's is a good restaurant overall, that satisfied my desires.        Before going to Chili's, I wanted the food to be just as it was, big portioned, savory, and inexpensive. I wanted the server to pamper me a little, but not too much so I could enjoy my meal and free time. I didn't care how the lighting was, nor if there was music playing. What I thought Chili's was going to be like, and what I expected it to be like were pretty much the same. This is because I expected the food to be averagely priced. I know before I went to Chili's that I wanted a steak. Therefore, I expected my meal to be twelve dollars. I expected there to be music, but it being low enough that people could barely hear it. I expected the restaurant to be a little crowded and noisy. I expected to be greeted at the door as well. I also expected for the servers to be polite and give good customer service because that's how they're supposed to present themselves. Because what I wanted and what I expected were pretty much the same, it leads me to believe that the restaurant is well-managed.        As soon as I walked in the restaurant, my friend and I were greeted by a hostess who stood in front of a counter. She asked for one of our name's, and told us that she would be right with us. After about three minutes, the hostess walked us to a tall booth. It was the perfect location and seat for my friend I. The seats were comfortable and it was an area where it wasn't too noisy. At the table there was an iPad. An iPad is actually on every table in the restaurant, which I think is cool. Anyone can use the iPad that's at their table to play games, pay for their meal, go online, and do many more other things. We used the iPad to pay for our meals, and we only looked to see what we could do on it. I really liked that there was an iPad on the table because not many restaurants have it. It was cool because it could be convenient if someone needs to go online they could, and if someone has wild children the iPad can entertain them.         That day at Chili's, I ordered a six ounce steak, mashed potatoes, and broccoli plate. About ten minutes after we ordered our food, it arrived at our table. The first thing I noticed when it arrived was that there was a big portion of food on my plate. I was surprised because it was only eleven dollars, which is very close to the average twelve dollar amount people pay for a plate of food like I had at a restaurant similar to Chili's. My plate of food was huge. In spite of my plate having a lot of food, my friend had less food on his plate compared to mine. He had ordered fajitas, which were sizzling hot when they came to the table, and his order came up to fifteen dollars. I guess his food was higher priced because it's more luxurious. He wasted some of his food because he still had fajita toppings left. However, he claims that his food was good and he was full. I on the other hand, cleared my plate of everything, was very full, and enjoyed every bit of the food that I had.         The person who served us was very nice and polite. He did take some time to check-up on us, but I understand because it was a busy day. We didn't need anything though. The atmosphere of Chili's was typical, because there were people talking but it wasn't too loud.  The lighting of the restaurant was casual, and I believe that there were no music playing.        Since the server was nice and polite, my friend told me to decide how much he should tip the server. People who work at restaurants work hard, so I told him that the server should get at least five dollars. So he tipped the server five dollars. I was pleased with this restaurant and enjoyed myself. I will be more than happy to eat at Chili's more often, and think that if anyone hasn't eaten at this restaurant they should. The food is awesome, big portioned, and well-priced. The servers are nice and polite, and the atmosphere is perfect. Everything went well for me, so I'm sure that everything will go well for anyone else who plans on going out to eat at Chili's. If you plan to, enjoy yourself!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey?start=20
Warren S.,"Gretna, LA",0,2,1,2.0,1/21/2011,"The hostess is horrible.  Keep sitting groups that came in before my wife and me. Waitress was extremely professional, and good at her job.  I ordered the rib eye, and did enjoy it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey?start=20
Harden T.,"New Orleans, LA",5,38,,1.0,5/6/2010,"This particular location desperately needs work!  From the ongoing racism from the black workers, to the gangster rap blaring from the kitchen, to the lackluster performance of the serving staff, to the fact that more than 75% of the time the orders arrive either wrong or cold or both, this location is definitely NOT worth the visit.  You would do better to hit the one out in Metairie if you want better service and food.  The real shame is, I live less than 10 minutes from this location, but have to drive over 30 minutes to visit a decent one to be able to get good service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey?start=40
Ana B.,"Gretna, LA",14,6,3,1.0,5/3/2012,"Don't even bother..NEVER AGAIN! Write up will follow..... From the moment we walked in (WE as in me and my son) the hostess never acknowledged us.  She probably walked passed us 4 times before asking how many..which I thought was strange because there was nobody else waiting, it was just me and him standing there.  When I told her 2, she turned away and left us standing there.  She finally came back and told me, You see that booth at the end by the exit, y'all can sit there and someone will be with you.   So we walked over to the last booth before the exit across from the bar.  We sat there for about 10-15 mins before the waitress came, if it weren't for my son who was hungry and did want to leave, I would have already been in my car.   We finally get to order,my son tells the waitress that he would like A1 sauce with his steak and she says oh ok I will get it to you and she walks off, the waitress had to come back 3 times to ask us what did we order to drink because she forgot....as we waited I told my son I cannot believe we are still sitting here, anyway about 20 mins later a guy brings us our food, my burger was cold and NASTY and the veggies that came with my son's dish looked old.  My son sat there waiting on his A1 sauce.....NEVER GOT IT!  THE WAITRESS was M.I.A never came to check on us, never saw her till we it was time for her to bring the bill. In the meantime I told my son... I just want to get up and leave and let her deal with the bill, if I knew I would not get in trouble I would have just left.  When she came with the bill I looked at her and said THANKS for checking to see if we needed anything, and thanks for filling up our glasses and AND MY SON WANTS TO THANK YOU for the A1 sauce...  she laid the bill on the table and walked off.  I am very disappointed that this location has fallen apart.  Maybe they need to get rid of the restaurant and just keep the bar open...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey?start=40
Wilver R.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,1/1/2015,"I ordered some food for carry out and everything was cold so I had to go back, and then wait an hour so they could give me the same halfway cooked food all over again and the managers didn't pardon for the wait or anything, they just stood there like idiots! Later I went home to eat and saw that 1 order of Texas cheese fries were missing! Horrible service, don't order carry out unless you want to be utterly disappointed. 1 star because it's been 2 years and still the same service of both food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey?start=40

It's a shame to associate the Chili's franchise with this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-harvey?start=40
