Keith S.,"Hendersonville, TN",22,27,13,3.0,8/19/2017,"My waitress did a great job and the food was good.  I thought this review was going to be worse when we arrived.  I used the NoWait App and arrived at the time prescribed. The host did not greet us when we walked in so I thought it might be a wait staff just checking his tables at the host stand.  After 10 minutes, I had determined it was the host and inquired about our table as it was showing on the App as 1 party in front of us.   He said the App was giving us the wrong time.  I asked how long our wait would be and he said he would go clean us a table off.   After we were seated about 10 minutes,  our waitress showed up and did a fantastic job. I had the chicken enchiladas which was good.  The restaurant had dirty tables when we walked in and the same tables were dirty when we left and food clearly on the floor around the table.  The table had a kiosk which I used to pay and completed a short survey letting them know it was dirty. A manager came by and asked how was everything and before we could say anything  she walked away.  The waitress saved the restaurant from a two star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Chris H.,"Hendersonville, TN",67,68,76,2.0,1/16/2017,"We love Chilis food, but the service was not what it use to be. The server was obviously new and needed more training. But I expect the manager or assistant manager to recognize this to help out the server. The food was 30-40 minutes from the time we ordered. The food obviously was sitting in kitchen as it was warm, not hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Vanessa P.,"Hendersonville, TN",2,22,,2.0,4/7/2017,"Weather for Hendersonville Tn weather  today 59 degrees and sunny outside . Inside chilis temperature was 50 degrees . Entirely to cold for customers to enjoy their meals . We literally froze , therefore causing us not to enjoy our meal . Other customers around us were complaining as well . Employees didn't seem to care because they were working and hot . I despise going into eat where the environment is so cold it's unenjoyable . Not sure we will be back . The boneless wings were over cooked , we had to reorder as well .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Mark F.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,3,,2.0,9/7/2017,"This is a Chili's I dine with, semi regularly, and have for years.  My server did not greet me for quite a while ( surprising as the restaurant was not busy at all).. after bribing my water I never saw her again.  My turkey burger took over 205minutes to arrive at my table, brought by someone else with a brief apology for being so long to complete.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Larry S.,"Hendersonville, TN",139,428,121,2.0,2/29/2016,"I still love Chili's Southwest egg rolls, they make great Margaritas, and the meals and service were fine. The only reason I'm writing a negative review is because the guy cleaning under the tables wouldn't keep his pants up.  He was wearing a belt, so it must have been intentional that he kept his jeans about halfway between his waist and his knees.  And every time he reached under the table, his rump was exposed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Pete H.,"Gallatin, TN",0,14,,3.0,7/26/2017,Must have gotten lucky the last time we were here the service was mediocre this time and the skillet queso was terrible I do not recommend the chicken crisper waffles way too sweet,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Tory R.,"Hendersonville, TN",2,7,1,2.0,12/30/2016,"Everything that could have went wrong, did. 30 minute wait, which is fine, but when a party of 6 has to wait an hour for a salad, then the food comes out 10 minutes After the salad and the food, all 6 entrees, are COLD! ....not okay. The only good thing tonight was the 2 for 1 bar drinks. And the manager did not even have the guts to come apologize!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
J T.,"Hendersonville, TN",33,4,,1.0,7/3/2017,Absolutely the worst. They didn't get one thing right on our order. We came in 30 minutes before closing and they complained that they had to turn everything back on. They promised to bring chips and dip and that never happened. Chills is the worst don't go here. I wish I could give this place 0 stars. BTW. This is isn't the first time this kind of thing happened. Where is management?  Why do they stay in business?  Avoid,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Jeff C.,"Gallatin, TN",349,90,64,2.0,10/26/2015,"I visited this location late on a Sunday night when the Wife and Daughter couldn't wait to get home to eat.  We chose Chili's specifically because of their relatively late Sunday night closing time of 11pm.  It's only 10pm in Gallatin, e.g. The restaurant was abandoned and only a few drunks remained at the bar.  Only bar seating was available, which was fine.  Two young ladies took turns waiting on us as they closed down the restaurant.  The service was good, considering it had likely already been a long day for staff.  We got the white spinach queso which is always great.  The girls drank water and I tried the merlot, which was very fruit, and the cabernet, which was much better.   The disappointment came with the entree the girls ordered to share.  The chicken fingers came in a deep-fried, tempura type batter.  It was not bad, per se, it was just odd. It was a little dense, even if it had otherwise seemed appropriate. The fries were only so-so, and the broccoli was raw-not even steamed.  The whole thing was kind of off, and if you're thinking, ""Well, that's what you should expect on a Sunday night at 10pm"", you're right.  I did expect that.  But I hoped for better. I'm old school and so I think if you're going to claim to remain open until 11, which, let's face it, is not really that late, even for Hendersonville, then you should be in a ready to serve posture.  If you don't want to serve that late, then close earlier, and change your hours.  But doing things half-assed, just because that's what works most of the time for most people in this country, is a real disappointment.  The girls were polite, but didn't hide the fact they wanted us gone.  They didn't even address it forthright, as you might expect, by saying, ""It's 10pm and no one else is here so we're going to start shutting down the kitchen..."", it was just unspoken.   I tipped 20% as I always do unless service is horrible, because this is a tough job, but I wasn't thrilled. If it seems that I'm a cranky old man, well, I am 40 and I am generally disappointed by the mediocrity that is common in our culture.  I want and hope for best.  I hope my experience at this Chili's is unusual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Richard A.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,44,,1.0,10/25/2016,"Last time I came here it was bad..really bad. Every single thing that could have gone wrong, did. All I ordered was a soup and salad. No ceasar salad on the menu anymore...then they were out of lettuce for a house salad...then she brought the wrong soup out...then she screwed up the gift card payment somehow. Chili's, I love you, but sheesh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Bryan S.,"Hendersonville, TN",9,5,,1.0,2/14/2016,"Got a to go order of fajitas with shrimp, they forgot the shrimp. Told the bartender and he was incredibly rude, brought out small dish of 5 shrimp. My fiancé also ordered fajitas with steak only, brought out chicken and when fixed they clearly just scooped out the chicken and added half an order of steak. Bartender then continued to talk to his drunk friends and act annoyed about fixing what should have been done right the first time. This was the third time service was terrible and combative. We will not eat here ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Emily B.,"Nashville, TN",20,156,46,5.0,6/9/2015,"Fast service, fresh food and you can really see the waiters and waitresses working as a team.  Always a plus in my book!  The cheese fries were so good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
Anthony C.,"Hendersonville, TN",2,10,1,4.0,2/9/2016,I came here on a Tuesday night and it was ok. I got the burgers and my mom got a type of chicken and it was pretty good. The service could of been better all and all it was pretty good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
"J, R, S.","Gallatin, TN",0,52,34,4.0,8/8/2015,"I love going to this Chilis. Great food, great service, great meal almost every time. It's a great place to just have a burger and go home. Real good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
April M.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,9,10,2.0,6/16/2016,Why is it always cold and sticky in here? Like the have the hot yoga humidity machine running along with having the air set on 60*? I can't stand to go in there anymore because I'm so uncomfortable. Other than that it's your basic Chilis.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville

Annette F.,"Nashville, TN",4,32,12,1.0,8/5/2014,"Horrible and slow service, and this is the second time it's been that way for me. People that work there look at you, but don't come over to seat you, or ask for your order. I shouldn't have to ask for someone to take my order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville

Helena E.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,8,2,1.0,8/21/2014,We got denied the dinning area no matter there where available tables so we went to the bar. Ordered a Tilapia plate which was raw! I returned and asked for a chicken sandwich that made me get sick for a whole day. Never go there!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hendersonville
