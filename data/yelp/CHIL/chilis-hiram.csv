Christopher P.,"Atlanta, GA",13,16,6,5.0,12/30/2017,"Last minute option last night after running a few errands.  I've been to this location before, but this time it beyond great.   **have you ever wanted something, and when you got it, it was much better than you anticipated.  That's how I described the service.   It was absolutely wonderful, and if I could recall the set up servers we had (party of 5), I'd thank them all by name.  Only could thank by tip, which is really what's it's all about (from the server's perspective). In short, great job all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Anna S.,"Atlanta, GA",23,106,98,3.0,9/25/2017,"Chili's knows what's up regarding their curbside pick up. Easy online ordering & upfront parking outside the TO-GO door. Simply text ""HERE"" when you park and out comes your food.  Despite loving this service, I agree with another review stating to stick with burgers and appetizers. I'm not even sure my chicken fajitas were 100% real chicken...for real.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Cynthia T.,"Greenville, SC",7,7,,5.0,10/29/2017,"Great visit, with 3 kids 6 and under in tow, nonetheless. Service was efficient and kind. Atmosphere was laid back and welcoming. Food was perfect temp, delicious, and plenty. Great deal for 2 with appetizer, 2 meals, and dessert. Lots of options, wide variety without being overwhelming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Brenda K.,"Dallas, GA",8,1,,1.0,9/25/2017,Just got back from chills in Hiram worse service I have ever had. Been there many times always good food and service. The young man today did not want to be there and it showed. I may go back but it will be a long long time too many restaurants to go to one with such bad service!!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Tim T.,"Atlanta, GA",1,18,1,3.0,6/3/2017,Good food. Tables are not big enough. I felt very crowded and the table seemed cluttered.  I do believe it is BS that they charge you $2 to play the computer that sits on the table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Brittany F.,"Smyrna, GA",0,8,,3.0,9/15/2017,"Service is always good but stick to burgers, and appetizers. Everything else is a hit or miss. Most often times (for me atleast) it's been a miss. Their new signature wings are really good! Dine in service is pretty fast but I would prefer to carry out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Shanika G T.,"Atlanta, GA",180,133,389,5.0,8/29/2016,I really enjoyed going to this restaurant. Our waiter was amazing. He was a young guy I believe named curtez. He was attentive and never let our cups get past half empty. Our food came out super fast. It was like they knew what we would order and prepared it before we sat down. The food was scrumptious. The atmosphere was nice. We will most likely be back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Amy W.,"Hiram, GA",3,26,2,1.0,10/14/2017,Called and set up arrangements for my daughter and her friends to have their homecoming dinner here and they assured me they had our name down and that they would be seated when they arrived. Well when they arrived they were told it would be a 45 minute wait!!!! We will never use this restaurant again and thanks a lot for ruining all 17 of these kids night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Tony W.,"Douglasville, GA",0,12,1,4.0,3/12/2017,Great meal at Chili's. we had lunch today choosing the beef tostada and sour cream chicken enchilada. Portion side was enough that we were able to split it. Jasmine gave great service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Judy F.,"Lewistown, MT",0,3,,5.0,9/12/2017,We received wonderful service and when they found out we were from Florida and evacuated from Hurricane Irma we were really treated great.  Our waitress was wonderful.  Wish I could remember her name.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
S L.,"Villa Rica, GA",67,23,7,1.0,2/11/2017,Awful service. Our waiter forgot about us. Ordered a well done burger for my son and it was medium. Asked for it to be taken back and I was lectured by the waiter about appropriate cooking for a burger. Seriously?! No cheese on the burger either and my son was given an American Cheese slice to put on his half cooked meat. We won't be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Auston R.,"Villa Rica, GA",3,71,312,5.0,8/3/2016,Came for our second visit first off our waiter was the best we got the triple dipper app was amazing southwest egg rolls were the best I got the prime rib burrito it was like eating a piece of heaven so good and the have great prices on drafts,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Angie U.,"Douglasville, GA",36,1,,1.0,3/11/2017,"Tried to take my mother here for lunch. We walked in the door, and waited to be seated. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. The bartender who was directly in front of us never even acknowledged our existence. A server walked right by us and also completely ignored the fact we were standing there. We finally left after no one ever spoke to us, not even to tell us it might be a few minutes. The place was not busy, and it was at prime lunch time. We went to Longhorn, where it was much busier, yet we were greeted warmly, seated immediately, and served promptly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Bryant R.,"Marietta, GA",122,2,,3.0,2/1/2016,"This location is mediocre at best. The food was okay, but seemed and tasted reheated, we had 4 or 5 different servers, wait time was ridiculous, and tables, silverware, tablets, and menus were all filthy.  P.S. Avoid the fajitas",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Constance B.,"Villa Rica, GA",60,9,27,5.0,8/3/2016,The service was great love the food will definitely be coming back to eat here... Very quiet place!! Think I found my new favorite restaurant!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
April R.,"Austell, GA",0,2,,1.0,8/10/2016,This was the worst food I've had in a long time---if ever.  Disgusting.   DONT GO THERE!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Christi S.,"Rockmart, GA",0,11,,5.0,3/19/2017,"We love this chilis! They have great service and the food is awesome! They're presidential margaritas are awesome as well. The tilapia mango dish was awesome. The chicken enchiladas are my favorite, and the sizzling fajitas are fantastic! I have also had the chocolate molten cake, very good. I've had a peppered sirloin with mashed potatoes, loved it. They're burgers are really good. The chicken crisper with honey mustard and corn are really good, seasonings on it, good. One time at the chili's in Rome, my son ordered a pizza, and it didn't look good at all; he was very disappointed that day. So, if they haven't changed their pizzas, I would not recommend those. Also, the quesso dip is really good. Their tortilla chips are fresh and hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Joshua A.,"Marietta, GA",58,18,7,4.0,1/18/2016,"Food is, more times than not, good.  I come here for lunch 2-3 times a month.  It's pretty fast majority of the time.  Service has always been great and friendly.   Today it felt like the host (a guy which is unusual) was filling in for someone who called out sick or didn't show up.  He was dressed super sloppy wearing a non-work related sweatshirt.  He had no sense or urgency and wasn't even standing at the host stand when i walked in.  He was sitting on the other side of the restaurant in a back corner booth. He walked as slow as molasses to greet me when i walked in the front door.  And when he got there his presentation of himself was just dirty looking and very unprofessional.   Other than that server was attentive and friendly. Food was delicious and came out super fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Dana R.,"Dallas, GA",32,3,2,1.0,12/19/2015,"Awful service, long wait, burnt steak and missing a meal. Come on guys get it together!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Nicollette C.,"Dallas, GA",110,120,70,3.0,3/31/2015,"I wouldn't not return to this location if it weren't for the automatic ordering tablets at the table. The service at this location has gone downhill SO bad within the last few years. The service here is very slow, not the friendliest, and very (how should I say) forgetful. The staff at this location is definitely in need of more training. However the menu selection (like all Chili's restaurants) is wonderful and very diverse. The perk of this location is whenever you're ready to leave, you don't have to wait even longer for your server to come back if you pay with a credit/debit card on the tables tablet. That's the best thing this Chili's location could have done. Warning about the tablets- all games on there cost $$... Don't let your bill surprise you at the end of the night because you thought all of the games and activities were free. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram
Todd O.,"Denver, CO",0,9,,2.0,5/14/2016,We have been fans of Chilis for years. My wife and I usually love coming in and usually know what we want to order before we get here. We have been on a bit of a  hiatus lately due to work and other stuff. Came back in tonite for the first time in a while and i must say we are both disappointed. The music is turned up so loud we can carry on a decent conversation much less hear our waiter. Chilis is losing a long time customer tonitr.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
Joey G.,"Corbin, KY",0,13,1,3.0,8/29/2015,"Good- Food was great! The Dine for Two, $20 deal is well worth the visit. Bad- The server was accurate with our orders, but not friendly or welcoming at all. Seemed to be rushing us out the door from the moment we sat down. Ugly- witnessed a family(including an infant) sit without service(after ordering-no food brought to table) for over an hour. Once the staff was notified, there was little effort to fix the problem. No vouchers or coupons, no addendum to the bill. Nothing. They were forced to pay full price. Not a good look.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
Alana R.,"Savannah, GA",43,43,7,1.0,12/29/2014,"My family and I (6 total, 2 kids) went last Saturday night after Longhorn had a 45 min wait.  We waited for 25 min at Chili's.  It took forever to get everything.  And we never had everything we needed.  One person had the fajita trio and I had the steak/shrimp fajitas - we thought you couldn't mess up fajitas - WRONG.  First, they serve all the condiments for fajitas in these little towers in tiny cups.  My tortillas were soggy and cold.  The fajitas came out steaming for me but the others weren't which meant they had been sitting in the kitchen.  The chicken tasted like it had been frozen.  One person ordered a simple burger and got the wrong one according to our server.  So the server brought the right one and the burger still had nothing on it even though it wasn't ordered that way. Now I will say - this place was packed but halfway through our meal we had no idea why.  When we left I realized it was because it took so long for people to get their food.  Poor management in the kitchen?  Our server was very nice and seemed embarrassed that we had everything to go with our fajitas but not our fajitas for a ridiculous amount of time.    The only good thing I have to say is that the southwest egg rolls and the spinach dip were good - but of course these are frozen and I can get them at the grocery store.   DO NOT visit this Chili's.  Go anywhere else.  Literally anywhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
Brittany W.,"Powder Springs, GA",132,16,10,4.0,2/17/2016,"Unfortunately this location has been granted the reputation of having slow service. I went here for lunch and they were fairly quick. Honestly I would think with two servers, the service would be exceptional and speedy. Maybe just the thought of two servers per table makes me automatically expect better and faster service, making the good service seem mediocre. Always great food though! The chips and salsa are a must!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
Carmen C.,"Smyrna, GA",37,49,,1.0,9/11/2015,"This used to be one of my favorite fast-casual restaurants.  Back in the day, before they discontinued the Awesome Blossom, I would order that, Southwest Eggrolls, Molten Chocolate cake and I was a Happy Camper.  Then they got rid of the Awesome Blossom.  It's possible that was the beginning of the end, when Chili's ""jumped the shark"".  Or jumped the chili pepper, in their case.  But I digress. They've changed their menu recently, it seems like they are trying to emulate more of a Chipotle-esque kind of feel.  Not a fan.  Not just of the menu changes, but of the service.  I'll stick the service at this location, which I have gone to three times in the past two months, once to sit down, once to take out.  Slow.  SLOW.  SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!.  And all the times I have gone during off-peak times when the restaurant wasn't even half full.  So I don't get it.  I will say, I am appreciative the woman working the ""To Go"" side of the restaurant checked my order before handing it to me.  Because it was missing items.  But I remember they said to give them 20 minutes to prepare the To Go order, I gave them 30 and they were still scrambling to get my order ready.  Meh. Now back to the menu.  Thank goodness they still have southwestern egg rolls.  And Molten Chocolate Cake.  But the other items, I do not care for.  They've even changed the mashed potatoes with the steak!  It used to be bacon and chives, now it's just some kind of cheese almost ""fried"" into the potatoes.  It was kind of odd. I long for the Chili's of days past, when the commercials were singing about Baby Back Ribs a cappella.  But I suppose that ship has sailed.  The Fonz has jumped the shark, er, uh Chili Pepper on water skis.  (shrugs)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
Kisha S.,"Dallas, GA",0,3,,1.0,11/28/2015,"My son and I just left there for a dinner date. The service and the food was HORRENDOUS!!!!! We ordered the 2 for $20. First off, the strawberry lemonade was watered down. I told the bartender and when he exchanged it, it tasted exactly the same. The server brought out the food (minus the appetizer and cutlery.) When I got the check, I was still charged for the drink. I will NEVER be going back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
Nik P.,"Hiram, GA",50,135,78,3.0,5/16/2015,Customer service here is always bad. Last two times I've gone here we have had to wait on a waitress and even had to ask for service. Last time we went they had a iPad at the table which we didn't use but got charged 99 cents for having it at our table. I ordered a drink which was tasty but I had to remind the waitress about my order. Also my nephew wanted ribs. Apparently there ribs cannot be served without the sauce.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
Donald R.,"Douglasville, GA",1,8,,4.0,12/31/2014,I have been here several times with my family through the last few weeks. Service was outstanding.

Kristin B.,"Hiram, GA",6,8,3,4.0,3/29/2015,"I order the Chilis to-go every couple weeks & my experience lately has been very well. Usually the food isn't ready when I get there but the staff has always been welcoming as I come to pick up. By the time I get home with the food, it's always very good, Not soggy or anything. We will continue to use Chilis and their To-Go services! Their customer service has improved over the last few months & I hope it stays that way!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20

Kenya D.,"Dallas, GA",5,26,,2.0,7/20/2012,"I've been here several times during  the dinner hours and service and food has always been good.   Just visited here for lunch today and service was extemely slow with a half full restaraunt. Food was barely warm and pretty tasteless,  I ordered the Southwestern BLT lunch combo that came with fries and a house salad for $6.  My niece had the pizza and fries off the kids menu. The Paradise pie was good, but they were kinda of skimpy on the caramel and chocolate sauce.   I will return but only during dinner hours because this is my first not-so-good experience here.  I'm going to say its the lunch time staff that just didn't have it together today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
David P.,"Dublin, GA",29,226,19,2.0,1/4/2012,"Ate with the fam on a Tuesday at 5pm.  We were one of 10 guest in the whole restaurant.  We quickly ordered drinks and dinner, I got the chicken taco.  The food arrived in a quick manner then everyone in Hiram with 3 or more kids showed up at once.  Once that happened we never saw our waitress again.   My tacos were dried out, my water never got a refil and we waited 15m after our table was cleared by the manager to request the check.  After 5 more minutes the check finally came and I paid cash so I wouldn't be there when they closed. I don't know if it was the time of day, lack of servers or what but it stunk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
Sophia B.,"Lithia Springs, GA",25,27,12,1.0,9/14/2012,"I get there and the place is packed but the wait was only 5 min. We get to the table and my seat was not wiped down (strike 1). I ordered the queso which was gross and although they had ground beef in it, it was terrible. It taste like the meat from Taco Bell and you couldn't taste any cheese in it. My server was terrible. I seen her at my table twice and she messed up my order because of course she didn't write it down. The manager was nice enough to refill my drink after complaining and taking off my appetizer but I was so disappointed that I didn't even bother to order a meal. It was time to go and I was glad to leave. I will not be returning AT ALL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
E M.,"Douglasville, GA",106,67,30,3.0,8/7/2010,"After sending a complaint to corporate about our last visit and receiving a gift certificate in response, we reluctantly decided to give them another chance. Only July 23rd, we ordered hamburgers (the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger) and as appetizers ordered the boneless wings and the fried cheese. What a difference this time!! The apps were great and hamburgers were delicious.  We both ordered medium cooked and to our surprise they were cooked perfectly. We found out from our waitress that the terrible tacos had received several complaints and therefore were changed now on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20

Bill S.,"Powder Springs, GA",0,26,,3.0,1/17/2014,Good burger. Other things range from good to so so. Picking up take out orders provides a view of the kitchen that can be a little disappointing to see.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
Kelly W.,"Hiram, GA",0,5,,1.0,4/20/2013,"Two friends and myself ate here last night. The whole experience started off bad. 1) I tried to call ahead but the phone was busy for 20 minutes. Do they only have one phone line? 2) my friend's strawberry lemonade tasted like weak kool-aid, after three tries for them to ""remake"" it she gave up AND THEY STILL CHARGED HER FOR IT. 3) they left ingredients off of her food and two crucial ones off of mine. I ordered the guacamole burger with a veggie patty. It's supposed to have grilled onions and peppers, grilled jalapeños, and guacamole. I got about three tiny slivers of grilled onion, and they had to bring me the guacamole and japs on the side after I had eaten half my food waiting for the server to come back. 4) We had to wait for water refills every time. 5) Our server took our order, checked on us once, and brought the dessert and tab. Every other thing was taken care of by a food runner--the best employee I saw was a well-dressed young man around 18 years old who had been working there THREE days. 6) All of the rest of the staff was unkempt and rather redneckish...I know it's Hiram, but they were dressed in camouflage. All of them! It's apparently a weekly theme. They looked sloppy and not at all like a consistent level of service you would expect from a chain. Very unprofessional. 7) when the three people who had been attempting to serve us realized we ordered dessert, it might have been nice to get it comped. I don't know if we should have even eaten it--it took forever to get after we ordered it and by that time it's after 10 (we were sat at 8:00) and they can't seem to make hot coffee that late at night. I drank two lukewarm cups and we got the heck out of dodge. I'll go back if I can have a server who speaks coherently and wears clothes that fit, and maybe brushes their hair now and then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20
