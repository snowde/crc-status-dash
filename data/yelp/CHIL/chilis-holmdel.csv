David W.,"Keyport, NJ",0,1,,2.0,11/3/2015,"I am sitting at the bar right now, I came in, I ordered my drink, then I ordered my food, the bartender was very nice.  I ordered chicken and beef.  Literally five minutes later my food comes out, I'm shocked.  At first, I thought, wow! The food must be undercooked! That was too fast! Then I saw, it was cooked, so then I thought, oh, they're like McDonald's, they keep the food on a warmer.  But no, as I was eating it, it all came together.  The plate was someone else's, they either sent back our cancelled, it was sitting in the warmer for a while, and then rather than cook me a new one, they served me someone else's old food.  Gross.  The bartender did a great job elsewise, I would have gave a one star",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel?start=20
Shaké K.,"Middletown, NJ",3,68,3,1.0,9/13/2015,"Our first visit a few months ago was ok except for all the chips we received with our appetizer and meals and when I say chips I don't mean tortilla chips, I'm talking about all of our dishes/bowls all having chips and cracks.  Our second visit was because someone in our party really wanted to go there. The food was never that good to begin with but as time passed, we've noticed a decline in the quality of food. This last time we went, it was only because we had a gift card and let me just say that it will be our last time. The service and food was ridiculous. I wanted to order the burrito with the prime rib but they were out. They were also out of the carnitas burrito and something else that the table next to us wanted to order (couldn't hear what they wanted, all I heard was that they were out). So I ordered a chicken burrito and she asked if I wanted sauce on it, I said no (the picture didn't show sauce on top). What does the waitress bring me? A burrito with sauce on top, then she proceeds to ask if it's ok that it has sauce on top...um really? You knowingly bring me the wrong item and push it on me?  Anyways, I know better than to send food back so i accepted it. I cut into it and what do I find? A filling that looked like a giant saucy, lukewarm, mess that didn't look anything close to the picture on the menu. I couldn't even tell if I was having chicken or pork. I wouldn't be surprised if it was someone else's incorrect order thay they melted cheese on and tried to pass off to the next person ordering a buritto. To top it off, my husbands burger had onions, which he asked for no onion and more than half the burger was so burned that he couldn't eat it. Add to it the fact that the waiter asked if we wanted our check before he asked if we wanted dessert and the fact that instead of bringing us our exact change of $13.50, they brought $13 (its not about the 50 cents, it's the principle of the matter), were pretty much done with this place. I think next time we'll hit up taco bell instead where they always get your order right and bring your food out nice and hot. It has been 5 hours since dinner and I'm still naucious from this meal. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel?start=20
Paul W.,"Red Bank, NJ",3,22,,3.0,3/24/2016,Ok last time I had the worst experience  ever. This time it bounced back. The portion was better then normal. I ordered the fried pickle and steak fajita. All hot and good. Dessert was nothing to complain about. The cinnamon roll was off the menu and got replace with berry crumb cake and ice cream. It was ok but wasn't the way it sounded. Service bounce back as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel?start=20
Josephine O.,"Hazlet, NJ",3,16,,1.0,10/21/2014,"Went to Chili's this past Sunday night. We were a party of 7. The staff was able to seat us pretty quickly. The appetizers & drinks came 10 minutes after we ordered them, margaritas, iced teas, & endless chips w/ salsa & quac. Water was not automatically provided. I had ordered more quac that never came.  Our main dishes took 45 minutes to come & when they did arrive my salad was wilted & overdressed, the burgers cold, & the black beans a congealed mess. Will not go to Chili's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel?start=20

Mike N.,"Matawan, NJ",64,65,26,5.0,2/15/2015,My wife and i went for an early sunday dinner and the service was superb.   We had the $20 for two dinner starting with tostada chips and salsa.  The chips came warm and perfect.  Sometimes these chips are too salty in other restaurants.   I got the mango-chile tilapia as it had a nice kick most likely from the jalapeno peppers.  The rice and broccoli were cooked just right.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel?start=20
Stephy S.,"Holmdel, NJ",138,559,46,3.0,4/19/2013,"My hubby and I decided to head out to dinner. In Holmdel, it is chain-restaurant mania. We decided to go to Chili's for their ""infamous"" 2-for-$20 (the amount of commercials we were seeing had officilaly brainwashed us). What was surprising was the place was PACKED on Saturday night. We somehow managed to sneak in after only waiting 5 minutes (yes, we got a lot of glares moving through the waiting area). The 2-for-$20 menu was pretty extensive. There were a bunch of dinner entrees you could chose from, and a bunch of appetizers you can choose from. We split the guac/chips. I got the mango tilapia and my hubby got the baby back ribs. All were OK, nothing life changing. I probably should've gotten something a little fattier (mine was off the healthier option) like quesadillas. My husband said the ribs were a little dry. But hey, it's Chili's. Clean and friendly place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel?start=20
Clare M.,"Hazlet, NJ",0,2,1,1.0,9/2/2014,"We've been coming here for years, of course it's a chain restaurant and don't except anything stellar but it was usually reliable. Tonight we stopped in and found a machine on the table which evidently has replaced most of what the server is supposed to do. The service was awful, appetizers were stale, food cold, no one checked on us after being served, couldn't get a glass of water and never had anyone offer to wrap up the leftovers. While paying the machine, a server did finally come over the ""show"" us how to leave a tip; the machine conveniently lands on 20%. We have always tipped well, for the sake of a few dollars we'd rather make a server's night. Tonight I would have left 10% if not for the server forcing the issue. Chili's, you've lost two customers.

Dan L.,"Brick, NJ",0,15,,1.0,3/9/2014,"Bad, bad, bad. This place is broken. Came in at 730 on 3/8/14, party of 6. Waitresses work in team duos creating confusion. One friendly who comes over often, but never with the correct items. The other stone faced who we see only when bringing incorrect items. So many mistakes it was laughable: 1st we're told its a 50 minute wait. Ok, it's Sat night and we're waiting for some of our party. Wait winds up being only 30 minutes..... Good start? Nah. We are seated where they have maneuverability to adjust tables for larger parties. This is done poorly with tons of wasted space. Not my problem, but a warning sign definitely. Also noticed the floor wasn't swept. Now for the highlights: Appetizer sampler served with incorrect items, and no app plates. Noticed there's no plates. Asked server. We didn't notice app items yet.  No plates come. Waitress comes over. We tell her about the wrong apps and no plates. She apologizes, says she'll be back with plates and replace apps. Replacements are quick, and the friendly waitress brings an extra plate of chips and salsa, trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together...... Still no plates. Dad's soup comes cold, sent back. Still no app plates. Told there are none?! They're being washed.  Dad's soup comes back. Still no plates????????? 10 minutes later app plates are here! 1 minute later entrees. Well most of the entrees. One is missing. Let waitress know, and ask for napkins.  Missing entree comes quick. No napkins. Ask again, they show up at some point. Mom's sides are wrong. Says it's futile to say anything. I agree. Bill comes. Over-charged, have to wait for correction. Wow, Chili's you set a record last night. I never saw so many mistakes in such a short amount of time. Whew. Also, one member of our party walked passed the kitchen and said it was a mess in there. ""Disaster"". I will say that my burger was good, and I never saw these kind of issues at other locations. Good luck to anyone that chooses this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel?start=20
Devin L.,"Yonkers, NY",296,684,95,3.0,3/7/2011,"I used to love Chili's in college. This place is a good spot for a few beers and a burger or chicken.  I went tonight for the boneless habanero wings, but to my dismay they no longer carry them.  In stead I had the burger bites, which were good, but hit my stomach like a ton of bricks.  They were peppercorn burgers with cheese, sauce and jalapenos. We sat in the bar and also had a few brews.  Not bad for the money.  The waitress was very attentive and nice.  The bar had the requisite tv's tuned to sports.  Thank you Chili's for having the NHL Network on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel?start=20
Anthony Z.,"Neptune Township, NJ",7,31,73,1.0,11/17/2013,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!! COCKROACHES!! I went here last night and we had to leave.  We haven't been to this location in a while but immediately after walking in we noticed that the place had gone down hill it didn't look to clean. We sat down and put in a drink order. when the drinks came the waitress took straws out of her apron and there was a live cockroach on the straws. Are you kidding me. It is that bad of infestation that they are in the waitresses clothing.  After she put the straws down we noticed and she just picked up the straw with the Roach still on it and walked it to the garbage. It didn't even bother her, like she was used to it. She didn't even apologize she just walked away.  When she came back we told her we are not going to stay she told us to wait for the manager.  He came over and just said ""I was told what happened and I understand,  don't worry about the bill. Have a good night. "" Like we were going to pay for anything anyway we didn't even touch our drinks. He didn't even apologize either. I hate to give a bad review, I love Chili's. It is one of my all time favorite restaurants. But this is unacceptable. What makes it worse is that we didn't even get an apology.

Danica W.,"Asbury Park, NJ",86,182,18,1.0,1/1/2013,"We were starving, and gave in to chain restaurant for grub. I wasn't happy from the start but willing to give Chili's a try since i do like mexican. In the door - waiting for 5 minutes for a hostess. I tell my husband, ""let's leave"". He insists we stay. restaurant is not packed, bar is small, decor awful. We finally get noticed and seated after 7 minutes waiting. As we sit and i ponder the sticky menu, avoiding the crumbs on the table - 3 servers walk past u. we are sitting at the table for 5 minutes & the smell of the restaurant is nauseating me. I say, ""Can we please leave?"" Husband says, yes and bolts for door. We leave menu's on table. What a disappointment of a place but definitely not surprised.

MIke H.,"Stockton, NJ",0,36,1,1.0,11/12/2014,"Went to this chilis 11/11/2014 at 2:00pm. Service was bad but they looked slammed so we were ok with this. Ordered the special TNT burger featured in a large special menu. The food was incredibly late. The burger was so overcooked that I could have played 3 periods of hockey with it. It looked as though my 8year old put it together. How a restaurant that highlights burgers COMPLETELY miss on all levels is unforgivable. I complained, they offered redo the order but I 1) did not have another hour to wait and 2) had no confidence that it would be better. I guess I am screwed by chilis .

Patrick M.,"Holmdel, NJ",136,392,266,3.0,11/27/2007,"I am not really sure what the appeal of Chilis is?  Every once and I will I feel the need to eat in this restaurant.   I think it is because the food is comfort food and the atmosphere is fun. On the weekends this restaurant is busy.  There is usually a wait and it is necessary to push through the crowd to leave a name with the hostess.  However, the bar is much less crowded now that New Jersey has banned smoking completely indoors.  Now it is possible to get a seat at the bar or at one of the tall tables in the bar area. I used to go for the fajitas but lately I have been ordering the Memphis Dry Rub Ribs.  I am actually starting to crave them while I am out on my bike rides not sure why.

Amit P.,"Jerusalem, AR",131,18,16,4.0,10/20/2017,"My first time in a Chili's was a great experience.  Far better than their chain competitors. Service was excellent; staff hustled and the manager came by to check on us twice during our stay. I also like the move toward table top technology for some ordering and paying the bill. Good diverse menu. Our fajitas were very good, plenty of food. The presentation of the cheese, sour cream, etc was cumbersome and took up too much room at the table. Rice and beans could have been warmer, but overall a very good meal. Kids burgers were fine. Dessert of a lava cake dish was very large and tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel

Nonetheless, the chicken was comparable to a chicken salad consistency.  It was so different then what I was expecting I found the consistency nauseating. Sadly disappointed.

Alexis K.,"Hazlet, NJ",1,33,3,3.0,3/1/2017,This is a nice place. The food is pretty good but the only complaint is the waiters/waitress.

John D.,"Old Bridge Township, NJ",60,68,13,1.0,5/8/2016,"We've been to this Chili's twice now. Both times were comical.  The first time, it was super busy, so service was slow and awful. My burrito was missing the side sauce when it was brought out. No one was anywhere to be found to ask for some. When we finally found our server, she took forever to bring it out. The meal was inedible without it. I ate my food alone, as I didn't want my girl to wait and have her food get cold. This last time, 5/7/16, we both ordered smothered pork burritos and a guacamole/chips app. Service was fast. The guacamole was barely mixed. Many large chunks of avocado. Not bad, but hard to eat without mashing it ourselves. The burritos that came out looked bad. Plating was pretty poor. One burrito was torn open. The side of beans was mostly bean water with a few beans and a piece of tomato. One side had several chunks of jalapeño, while the other had none. The kicker was that both ""pork"" burritos contained shredded beef. We didn't mind, because they actually tasted good, but when we pointed out the error, the waiter insisted it was pork. We did find some pieces of actual pork toward the end of the burrito. It seems that whoever was in charge of shredding meat did not know the difference, and shredded a piece of steak into the shredded pork bin. Like I said, we weren't upset, because it was actually good! It is just comical that they would make the mistake, and insist it was correct. The server did not give half a shit. Of course, the paying kiosk had no paper for a receipt. Typical of Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel

Dave C.,"Carteret, NJ",0,50,10,1.0,3/6/2017,One of the worst experiences in recent memory for the two of us. first of all it was a Monday night and the restaurant was practically empty. there were a few people at the bar but they seated the two of us in the one area of the restaurant where everyone else is. we asked to sit in a more quiet area and they did. we ordered and everything was fine. then a waiter behind us started dragging tables and chairs behind us making so much noise we couldn't even talk to each other. turns out they were setting up for a table of 8. we asked for our waiter so we could leave and then our food arrived. we were greeted by the manager who said there was no where else to put the party. we asked for to go containers so we could go home and eat in peace. he comped one of our meals even though the whole dining experience was ruined.

C M.,"Hazlet, NJ",0,9,,1.0,5/16/2016,"Okay so let's start off with expectations. Chilis is a place you go to in order to not die.

So you get takeout from Chilis. We ordered two chicken sandwiches; one plain, the other with no whatever condiment they put on it and a different cheese. What did we get? I pull the styrofoam container out of the bag. Written on the front in green marker and underlined was ""NO BACON"". What did I find in the box? Fries, and a roll with bacon on it. No chicken. Do you grasp what I'm tell you? On the box that said NO BACON--That's all I got, no chicken, just bacon! Open the other box--fries, roll, bacon and cheese. No chicken. Am I being trolled by Chili's? I went back to get the CHICKEN FOR MY CHICKEN SANDWICHES and they didn't even discount the order--they just gave me more shitty fries.

I had the New Craft bacon cheeseburger at the Chili's in Holmdel NJ. Once again, it rocked! I ordered it medium rare, it came out medium (exactly how I like it). Good bacon, nice tomato, great brioche bun. That sort of thing. But the burger was fucking delicious. Goddamn it. Juicy and flavorful. It melted in my mouth, but had just the perfect amount of chew. A great combination of tender yet resilient. Once again, the fries were anemic and sparse, but for this burger, I would endure much worse than a few soggy potatoes. Burger aficionados must try this.
