Tito M.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,4.0,1/14/2018,Although the wait was slightly long (Saturday night) the waitress made sure we had everything we need and more. The food was great as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2
John V.,"Miami, FL",394,167,2358,5.0,7/17/2017,"This location is less than 2 miles from our house! We are so lucky to live so close to an amazing spot. Always on point, always fresh, great servers. My last visit (June 2017) I was so impressed with our waitress, I requested a manger, and told him that she was so excellent! Please do that in addition to your tips, it goes a long way in the service industry. Still looking for the CHili's though. But they have really ramped up their Tex-Mex menu and their Fresh Mex bowls. I mean they have roasted Sweet Corn on the Cobb, Mexican style with mayo, lime, salt, and seasoning! Wow! They have a Texas style BBQ platters which are called Smokehouse Combos (2 meats) and an Ultimate Smokehouse Combo (3 meats): ""Smoked low and slow in-house with 100% natural pecan wood."" [website] All round service is usually great, the restaurant is busy, they are a staple in this community, the managers are awesome and care for the customers experience. How I know? Because I get asked to do a review every time I eat there. Full Bar on site. Try their Dinner for Two, which gives you everything from drinks, to app, to two full size entrees, to dessert. But you never can go wrong with the Fajitas. I've enjoyed all theses dishes, and never had a issue so far. I will continue to go until they finally fail me once. I'll let you know...lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2
Anthony G.,"Homestead, FL",51,173,301,3.0,4/16/2017,"A bit disappointing.  Firstly, the service was a bit subpar. The waitress seemed annoyed to be at work or serve me or both. Quite honestly if you don't want to be at work don't come in. She had a bit of an attitude. Moreover trying to find her to pay for my food took me like 10 minutes and I was pressed for time. Secondly, the food was bland and lackluster. I ordered the ribs and i felt like I could have gone to any other restaurant and gotten a better rack of ribs. They almost tasted like those precooked store bought ribs...which is to say not very good. The crazy thing is I went to this chilis when it was relatively not packed...I cannot imagine the service and food during peak hours. Will certainly have second thoughts about coming back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2
Pate A.,"Lexington, SC",3,198,78,3.0,10/19/2017,Just average chain food.  Wait staff ok.   Our fiid was ok.  Desserts good.  Particularly the cookie with icecream.    The chocolate molten cake was kinda small though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2
LaShonda M.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",6,13,2,2.0,10/6/2017,We did take out and ordered 2 mix & match ribs meals. I absolutely love Chili's but this location completely missed the mark. I gave 2 stars because my daughter order a steak and loaded mashed and it was ok. The asparagus & ribs were horrible. The ribs were very dry they were seasoned well but who can eat dry ribs  no one!!

Allan B.,"Homestead, FL",0,14,,1.0,10/8/2017,"The service was pathetic. We ordered UNSWEET teas, due to medical reasons.We were served sweet teas.  When my wife asked for Splenda, the waitress said the 4 sweetener options (white, pink, blue & yellow) were all the same. Each has a very different chemistry & many people are allergic to one, but not another. My food came out, but my wife's food did not. Another 10 minutes and her food arrived. The food was not bad, but not great either. This restaurant was FILTHY. Crayons, napkins & other debris in the walkways, not to mention that the floors were wet. The bathroom was so dirty, my wife decided to wait until we got home. We decided to give this place a 2nd chance. since our last time eating there was a slightly below average experience. A manager never even came by our table. We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2
Maria F.,"Miami, FL",70,15,23,1.0,8/6/2017,"If I could give this location a -5 stars I would. This has got to be one of the worse Chili's I've been to in awhile. We went for dinner and got seated after 10 minutes waiting which wasn't too bad. Once we sat down is where the nightmare began. There was a large party to our left that were divided in two booths and were super LOUD and OBNOXIOUS! 15 minutes pass by and no one came to us to even give up water to start. We had a child that was hungry so we just got up and left. What's even more disappointing we didn't even see a manager on the floor like other locations because I looked to say something.

Ced T.,"Key West, FL",65,11,3,1.0,2/25/2017,By far the worst serice I received in miami. The waitress didnt show up at our table until 15 minutes after we were seated she had an attitude about being short staffed. She got mad when I changed my appetizer. The food I ordered was the smokehouse combo which I hope no one orders. The chicken was salty the ribs had no flavor the bbq sauce was horrible. It was a bad experience and no manager was around to assist me. I will never go back to that place ever and I hope none of you reading this goes as well,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2
Brandn K.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,9,16,4.0,4/19/2017,This chillis is a nice pace to go and catch a drink and a sorts game. Bartenders are nice and respectful as well as prompt. Don't mind changing channels for customers. The food is great is as well. Again very prompt service all around. The only thing I will say is the bar area is somewhat cramped. If they would rearrange the tables to make more space it would be a 5 star bar and grille.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2

Randy R.,"Homestead, FL",198,134,358,3.0,10/24/2015,I have had both good and some crappy times at this chilis. Recently the past 5-6 visits have all gone as normal as can be expected with good service. Overall I think its pretty cool they are amping up there tex mex menu and adding some pretty cool authentic mexican plates in. We tried the table side hand made guac with bacon and chips and it was a pretty cool experience. Our waitress brought everything out and literally made the guac in front of us which is something we've seen at local mexican restaurants with the guac and salsa. So it was cool to see her do it.  I went with the bbq ribs and shrimp combo with their loaded mash (which I love) and the corn on the cob. Everything came out pretty quick and was hot. Pretty much once we where done with the guac and chips the food was ready for us. Are waitress was very nice and got all our stuff right away. I have had some pretty shitty luck with getting waiters and waitress on their first day so it was relieving to get someone with knowledge of the menu!  Only thing I hate about this chilis is its a dead spot for your AT&T cell phone. They also do not have wifi available so if someone is dying you wont know till after lunch or dinner lol.  Overall decent spot for dinner that gets a lot of business in homestead (usually a wait of 20-30 after 7pm),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2?start=20
Esther C.,"Homestead, FL",21,4,1,1.0,9/4/2016,The service was absolutely horrible! The bar was disgusting we actually had to ask for drinks! They totally ignored that we were even sitting at the bar!

Michael E.,"Homestead, FL",4,43,7,2.0,6/13/2016,"Bathroom at 4pm on a weekday is a borderline biological quarantine zone. I can't really see how this can be the case during the slowest time of a restaurant's operation. The service is effective, but they really don't ever seem to have any personality or act like they aren't inconvenienced by you being there. Food has always been pretty ok, good job by the kitchen staff if anything.

Lazaro C.,"Homestead, FL",49,1,,1.0,3/23/2017,"Horrible service, I've worked in hospitality for several years so from my perspective it was a hot mess.

Tanya B.,"Homestead, FL",35,46,25,1.0,6/11/2017,"I do not know why I even wasted my time going into the restaurant. I usually carry out (which is awesome) but my co-workers wanted to eat in.  When I arrived, 2 of our party was there. They warned that our waitress, who was usually cordial, was not in a good mood. When she finally reached the table (10 min delay) she wanted to take our drink order, but we were ready to order. She put in our order and brought our drinks. I ordered the shrimp tacos, but did not know that they were spicy. I asked for some more water and some cilantro sour cream because my mouth was burning. She walked away, took another table's order (Party of 4), went to the back to get more water and that table's drinks, and then came back. She told me that the manager would bring the sour cream. In a monotone voice, the manager stated that they were out of cilantro sour cream and brought me regular sour cream. (This is lunch, not late dinner! How are they out already???) Anyway, in the end, I had to pay with cash. She roughly handed me my change, and walked away. Next time, I will just stick with takeout!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2?start=20

Barbara P.,"Homestead, FL",34,21,91,2.0,4/7/2015,"Went for lunch on a Tuesday. No problem finding a parking right in front and finding a booth. Restaurant is clean and looks modern, server was very attentive and the best part and why I gave it 2 stars. I ordered the Classic Sirloin with grilled avocado which is part of their lighter choices menu at 410 calories. My son ordered a plain Craft burger with cheese and fries. Hubby ordered the fresh mex pairings with 3 sides.No appetizer and just 3 sodas. The food came out in a fair amounf of time but the food was just not very good. My son's burger was the best of the 3 meals and it's a burger. My food was just blah and after I finished I got a slight queez feeling and I think the combination of garlic and tomato was too much. Hubby said his food was flavorless and just not very good. I tasted the beans and rice and agreed. The rest tasted like bad tex mex and just no love in the food.  Unfortanely we won't be back anytime soon. We did have a gift card so that was a plus since the meal was essentially free but I would avoid this unless you want appetizers and drinks since it seemed they had a lot of buy 1 get 1 free. Otherwise very disappointing. Next time we'll go to Longhorn which doesn't disappoint or even Olive Garden or Ruby Tuesday but for the price which our ticket was $42 not worth it at all..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2?start=20

I had to flag down manager for plates napkins silver wear and water. really, how about a simple strategy. If manager wants to play bus boy, follow up and put these items out after the order of your waiter is running around overwhelmed. Drinks and food good.

Enrique G.,"Homestead, FL",9,20,1,1.0,6/16/2015,Ate at the bar at Homestead Chilis.  Bartenders here can NEVER do a good job. Bar is always a disaster with dirty plates waiting to be taken to dishwasher. Beer is always good and food is too...if not...I would never go back. Manager and food runners go to bar to drop off food or tell bartender something but don't pick up plates or help bartender in any way. Clean a glass...pour a beer...do something! And barkeep...you will never do a good job if instead of looking at your guests...you look down at the floor all the time! Pick up your heads! Oh...and try to move fast..it isn't deadly! Cell service is the worst here. No wifi and they don't care what you think about it either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2?start=40

Josie W.,"Hollywood, FL",3,97,,2.0,9/20/2013,"I'm only rating this 2-stars because the food (once we got it) was very good. Other than that, the service here is terrible. First of all, I called to place a to-go order. I was on hold almost 10 minutes before someone finally picked up to take my order. The guy who I spoke with was clueless about the menu and what was included in the items I ordered and I had to read word-for-word from the online menu (the online menu was not working to place orders which is why I had to call). When we went to pick up the order, there was a sign at the to-go station saying to pick up orders at the bar, which is fine, except that there was no one tending the bar area and the servers just kept walking past us without any offer to help. Finally the bartender came out but instead of going to get our order immediately, she first took time to flirt (almost making out) with one of the servers...just what I want while I'm waiting for my food. She brought it out and handed me the bill and took my credit card payment and walked away before taking back my signed copy. My husband tried to hand it to a server as I did not feel comfortable just leaving it unattended at the bar area and the server took it and left it right at the bar area where I did not want to leave it. I couldn't believe there was so much incompetence and slackness in one place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2?start=80
Joe S.,"Honolulu, HI",1,3,,1.0,4/27/2013,"They still don't cease to amaze but in a BAD way. We went in to eat at the Homestead location. We waited for the hostess who didn't show up. Three employees saw us there waiting but didn't greet, acknowledge, or give any indicators that someone would be there to help us. Never felt so stupid in any restaurant. Now I know what my friends were talking about when they warned not to waste our time on this place. Management needs to reinvigorate their staff or they need to find a job elsewhere because I could never allow my staff at my restaurants to ever do this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2?start=80

We sat at the bar and noticed we'd been waiting there for fifteen minutes. The general manager was behind the bar with a bartender. Finally the general manager introduces himself and tells us that some people refer to him as ""God"". It may have been a feeble attempt at humor, but at that point we really weren't receptive to it or impressed for that matter. Apparently one of the waitresses was a no show or something because we waited for over an hour to place our order and waited another 40 minutes for our food. Finally I just notified a waitress that we'd like to pay for our drinks and leave.

Alisha R.,"Homestead, FL",234,79,101,2.0,9/2/2014,"I was here on Thursday after a local high hook football game and was pretty disappointed. The food was average for a chilis no major complaints there, but the service was horrible.  We sat down in the bar area and waited almost 10 mins for our drink order to be placed, then it was probably another 10 mins or so for drinks (2 beers) to come out. Also I made a rookie mistake and didn't ask for him to wait to bring out the second beer and since they were 2 for 1, the second one sat there getting hot.  After drinks we ordered the new table side guacamole and it was lacking. The server put probably 7 ingredients in but when you tasted it you could only taste mashed up avocado.  Once we finally got our food it was room temp at best. The chicken tenders tasted like they had been fried much early and were kind of tough.  Will I be back ... Maybe.

(And it was 6pm on a Monday evening!  What's up with that?)  We happened to drive by this Chilis, and we were pretty hungry by then, so we stopped.  The service was a bit slow at the start, but after that was quite good and I have no gripes at all about our server.  But too bad he couldn't also cook, because the burgers we got were quite mediocre.  I used to really enjoy a Terlingua Pride, from wa-a-a-a-y back in the day, but since then the burgers have gotten worse and worse over the years.  After this experience, I may finally just write off Chili's for burgers, forever.  Red Robin is way superior, and I think even Burger King would be better.  Let's just say, they either don't know what they are doing, or are provided inadequate training and materials to work with.  Again, this isn't a one-time thing; I've seen them go downhill for years, and at just about any Chili's, in any state.  Most of their other entrees are often good, but stay away from their burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homestead-2?start=60
