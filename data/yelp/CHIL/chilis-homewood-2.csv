Lucy T.,"Birmingham, AL",272,208,276,4.0,8/23/2017,"This was my first time at a Chili's in almost 20 years, and I was quite impressed. I came here for lunch and was quickly seated and served. I had a lunch combo that started with a small fresco salad. It was very fresh, nutritious, and came with a crumbled queso cheese. I loved it! By the time I was about done with it, my quesadilla and side of fries came. Fries come with the quesadilla which is a rather odd pairing, but I won't complain. I ordered the chicken bacon ranch quesadilla which was a bit interesting. It had a lot of peppers and not as much cheese as I was expecting. The fries were the really good thick cut fries I enjoy. I didn't see any ketchup around, and they could have been a tad warmer. I had probably the sweetest waitress ever! She was very welcoming, made suggestions, and made me feel very well taken care of. I highly recommend going during their lunch if you like plenty of options! The menu was huge!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2
Tom T.,"Longwood, FL",6,30,10,1.0,1/3/2018,"Doesn't even rate one star...worst experience I've ever had just trying to get into a restaurant.  Only a few tables were occupied in the restaurant but there were several people waiting at the entrance for someone to assist them.  No one showed up to greet at the front for several minutes. So we checked in the bar, which has always had open seating. There was plenty of room at the bar and several tables empty, but the response from the extremely rude person behind the bar was along the lines of ""if no one put you here, don't be here"".  We, along with several others then left the establishment.  We will surely never return to this location,  and will probably never walk in a Chili's again, which is sad as we usually like it, but this was further over the line than anything I've seen before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2
Elise G.,"Birmingham, AL",69,136,403,3.0,3/9/2017,"This was my first visit to a Chili's restaurant. We were promptly seated by a very quiet (and not very welcoming) hostess and our waitress took our orders fairly quickly. The food was fine. Just your typical chain restaurant....not spectacular, not awful. I ordered the Chicken Crispers and a side salad. The crispers were more oily than crispy.  They have little ""Ziosks"" on every table that you can order appetizers and drinks from, in addition to playing games like trivia. Be warned that if you play any of the games on there, you will be charged $2 (this was not very clear when we started playing)! You can also pay for your meal via the ziosk, which we did. We opted to have a receipt printed out (as opposed to e-mail or text), but the ziosk was out of paper. If you need a receipt for work or anything like that, I'd get someone to check and see if there's paper in there, or just get the receipt e-mailed to you. I will not go out of my way to return, but wouldn't be opposed if someone else really wanted to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2

I stopped here with some family for a late dinner when most other places were closing and Chili's had no problem accommodating us. They had a killer deal going on that was two full size entrees and an appetizer for $22! My friend and I both ordered the fajitas, he got the chicken and I got the pork. Each of our dishes came with three tortillas, grilled onions and bell peppers, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, salsa, black beans, and rice! The black beans and rice were some of the best and most flavorful I've ever had, I ate them separately because I liked them both so much individually! For our appetizer, we each got a side salad. Mine came with onions, cheese comma and ranch. Our waitress was a super sweetheart in the worked very hard to make sure that we had everything we needed. All in all, it was a great experience and value for the money!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2

Derrick M.,"New Orleans, LA",234,55,131,2.0,3/28/2017,"Came to this place on a work trip to grab some drinks after a long day. We had a party of about 12 ppl & they split us between three tables. We had one waitress between (Paulize) who was not the nicest. She was kind of rude as if she did not want to serve our large party. She was very short worded. All I ordered was two beers but they took EXTREMELY long to get or drinks. It took at least 30 mins for our alcoholic beverages...NO LIE!!  Then she told me that i could only have one beer at a time (not a problem). Secondly, i order a second beer and it took yet another 30 mins then after I pay the waitress comes back & says that she took my other beer off because they didn't have anymore Beers. Needless to say I was upset & don't think I will ever come back to this chilis ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2

Now in all fairness I've been here before during ""happy hour"" time at the bar & had wonderful service. Great drinks too! Whoever the day time bartender is....she's good. My carnitas tacos were good as usual!  Now back to the review. Slow service on this particular night. We had a server who forgot that we said NO salt on our margaritas. (Which btw took 15 min for the drinks to come out)  Cool. We're pretty fun girls so we didn't send them back...that's wasting alcohol. Thats a no no lol! So as we continued to drink our salty almost watery margaritas we were finally ready to order. It took our server forever to come back. Once she finally came & took our orders we didn't see her again until after the meal. AFTER! She asked if we needed anything & we're looking like..well no. We're finished now.

Elena N.,"Birmingham, AL",8,10,5,1.0,5/30/2016,"As most of the reviews on here; wasn't pleased with the slow service and food quality. My husband and I ordered curbside Saturday night (5/28/2016). We love us a good Chili's meal -- but this location continues to disappoint time and time again. We ordered right around 7:30pm and we arrived at Chilies right around 8:10pm to pick up. We always do the $20 meal for 2 -- I ordered the 6oz sirloin, corn on the cobb, and added a shrimp skewer (for $4.99); my husband ordered the Chicken fajitas, and we got the Texas cheese fries as our appetizer.  When I got to the counter, the young man was polite, checked me out, told me he was waiting on my husband's fajitas and did I need a drink. I politely accepted the drink offer and thought, okay! this going to be good! -- Boy was I wrong! It took another 15-20 minutes to receive our food and by the time we got home (which we only live like 5 mins from this location) the food was already cold. the young man who originally helped me looked really busy; but i don't understand why we had to wait that long when we had given them 45min to prepare anyway. So...onto the food. The only thing that was good were the chicken fajitas. They gave a good portion size and the chicken was seasoned nicely. (there were peppers with the chicken. they don't give much on the fajita shells though -- we found ourselves wishing we had 2.3 more). They didn't give any lettuce with the fajitas either; which was kind of a bummer.  The rest -- it was edible. I ordered my steak medium rare; and i am so glad I did because the steak i received was definitely more towards the medium well side. the steak was cold and tasted ok. (i could do a better steak myself). The shrimp that i paid an extra $5 for were a JOKE. they were the tiniest shrimp I have ever seen served with a meal -- and were also; just okay. (at least they weren't rubbery!) Corn on the cob was mushy; but i love corn so I still ate it.  The texas cheese friends were stuck to the aluminum foil they were placed on. completely dried and no telling how long it sat there waiting for the rest of our food to be done. we had to peel aluminum foil off the bottom of the fries and the taste was bland.   overall -- very poor experience and we will not be back to this location. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2

It was our date night spot, if you will. But THIS location was awful! The service was slow as can be and the food was also disappointing. I usually get the 6oz sirloin. Normally it's creamy in texture and had a delish aroma from the melted butter on top. This time, it was dry and chewy. The only thing that saved this meal was the $2 house margaritas, but those too took a lifetime to get to our table.

Walked in & saw a few empty seats at bar, but then saw leftover dishes at all 3 seats.  Looked around to make sure no one was returning.  No one in sight, figured I'd ask the bartender.  Stood there for legit 5 minutes & there was NO bartender.  Two different waiters bumped into me, I asked second & he said bartender walked away.  Then he rushed away.  No help clearing the area, offering an apology, or help of any kind.  Kept standing around & decided to leave.  Never have I seen staff leave dishes for so long unattended.  They should've been cleared when the check/tip was picked up.  No help from 3 other employees.  It was NOT that busy at all.  Luckily I found refuge at Hooters down the street.  I like Chili's back home, but this location couldn't even get me seated.  Management needs to look into a lot of problems, I can only imagine if it was a weekend evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2
Steven W.,"Cortlandt, NY",19,10,,1.0,7/12/2016,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, and although I used to like Chili's, I hadn't eaten there in years because I felt the quality of the food went down overall.  But I have been traveling recently in areas where there aren't many food choices, so I decided to give Chili's a try again - in a location in Great Falls, MT.  It was actually very good, and thought they had made a turnaround. So, tonight I find myself in Birmingham, AL (in the Homewood area), and decided to go to the Chili's here for dinner with a large group. Wow - was THAT a mistake. Absolutely everything was horrible.  Took forever to get the drinks we ordered.  And when my Patron margarita finally came, it was all acidic, chemically faux lime flavor, and I'll be damned if there was any tequila in it at all, let alone Patron.  Appetizers that arrived were OK, but the main courses started arriving over an hour after we arrived.  The servers were painfully slow, and the kitchen couldn't seem to turn anything out without an interminable wait.  Dishes came out with long waits between each, so some people at our table had finished eating before other diner's courses arrived.  And the food itself?  Can only describe it as inedible. I had a fish taco - fish was stinky and old.  Couldn't eat it.  Shrimp taco?  Shrimp was rancid, with a horrid bitter taste.  Rice was ice cold.  I sent it back and couldn't stomach the thought of trying anything else from there.  My friend ordered chicken tacos, which at first seemed fine until he found rock-hard shards of something we couldn't even identify.  Could have been dried out chicken pieces, or maybe bones...had no idea.  My other friend ordered only a salad with chicken, which came out after everyone else was finished eating at our table.

A week later on my return home, found out the server had charged extra on my credit card for an extra tip. I had tipped him in cash and wrote cash on the receipt. Guess it wasn't enough for him.

I know he was probably busy, but BOTH of them disappeared on us. I had to ask to have my drink refilled, get more napkins, and no one ever asked if we were ok after we were served our food. In addition, thee food that day was pretty bad. My guests dish was too spicy (spicier than usual) and mine was more spicy than I remember. I must say, after this experience, I have not gone back.  The time I was there before this, the waitress was rude and put off by any conversation (my mom and I).  She also disappeared on us and I had to bother the host for different things.

This tendency to make inane excuse after infuriating excuse after OUTRIGHT LIE when things aren't working right is something that absolutely mystifies me about Southern culture.  This is not the first place my family has encountered this attitude -- it seems to be widespread in doctors' offices, other restaurants, and even grocery stores in this area.  Who are you trying to make feel better, people?  Yourselves?  Because all you're doing is making an already irritated paying customer even more irritated at you.  While it's amusing to watch for maybe half a second, after that ... well ... I don't think one (here's looking at you, Chili's management) ought to be paid for having the attitude (or the business acumen) of a chicken with its head cut off. In summary, avoid this place like the plague if you want decent service (or decent food).  For crying out loud, even the McDonald's or the Taco Bell a few blocks away do a better job than this.  Better yet, stay at home and make yourself a packet of instant ramen noodle.  That's still better (and probably more hygenic) than eating at this irredeemable establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2?start=40

I had to ask for a refill on my tea twice while eating my meal and three more times after I got my check only to finally give up and leave. The place smelled like dirty mop water and the staff was more interested in caring on and playing around in the kitchen. The bartender played and her phone in the corner and talked with staff more then she did anyone at the bar. I usually tip very well based on service but felt very dissapointed with myself to have even left a $2.00 tip.

Allison W.,"Southern Pines, NC",0,5,3,1.0,2/19/2014,"If I could give this Chili's location zero stars, I would. I used to travel out of town weekly for several years, and I can say with authority that this is the worst Chili's I have ever eaten at in at least 20 states. We ate once in the restaurant and once tried to get take-out. The restaurant is filthy. I don't just mean food on the floor and sticky tables; I saw into their kitchen while waiting for take-out and saw food and unidentified filth covering the floors and most surfaces. Kitchen staff were sitting on and lounging around food prep counters. While eating in the restaurant, problems included: very slow service, inaccurate orders, cold food, and hearing other angry customers complain loudly about the same issues (and in 3 cases, seeing them storm out). Our server was very nice, but we got the impression that the kitchen staff made her job nearly impossible. Knowing this restaurant's difficulties with speed, I called ahead by 45 minutes for take-out on another night. When I arrived, I then had to wait another HOUR for our food. During that time, 2 other customers began shouting at the staff because they had been waiting longer than I had, and both ended up leaving with no food. We finally got our food, but upon arriving home, we discovered that all three salads were incorrect, did not include the meat listed in the menu, and had no salad dressing. I called the restaurant, and they were very polite and apologetic. I was assured that they would have the salad dressing and meats ready and waiting when I returned. So, I drove all the way back to Chili's to discover that nothing was waiting for me. After waiting an additional 45 MINUTES for just salad dressing and grilled salad meat, I told them I was leaving. At that point they finally brought out some salad dressing and the meat for ONE of our three salads. The dressing was not even what was listed in the menu for our salads. We will never eat at this restaurant again. I have to say that throughout our visits, the servers were very nice. However, I get the impression that their managers and kitchen staff do such a poor job that the servers can barely get the food out to customers. I don't see how they stay in business when so many people give up and just leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2?start=60
Rosemary H.,"Decatur, GA",0,3,9,1.0,11/17/2010,"Terrible experience.  I've liked eating at other Chili's locations, but every element of tonight's dinner went wrong.  Very slow service, with big delays at every step, including to even come by the table for drink orders, and it was not busy at all.  Half of us got our drinks a good 10+ minutes after everyone else.  My entree was wrong, and I swear the waiter knew it, given that he picked up the plate, gave it a funny look, put it down again, and handed everyone else their plates first.  I guess he decided to try to pass it off on me, nevertheless, because he did then give me the plate he'd frowned at.  It was the wrong entree.  I sent it back.   Meanwhile, others with me have empty glasses and have asked for refills a second time.  Of course, everyone else was nearly done before my correct entree showed up.  Mysteriously, it was lukewarm as though it had been sitting around the whole time, and it had bacon crumbled into the mix.  (I've been vegetarian over 15 years.)  Double-checked the menu - nope, not supposed to be in there.  Vey little concern was ever expressed, and no apology or offer to make things up to me or my companions was ever offered.  I asked that my meal be comped, and when the server (eventually) arrived with our bills, I was offered a $5 discount and the statement, ""This is what we can do for you,"" before he turned perfunctorily away.  I simply went to the manager with a matter-of-fact description of my experience, but he gave me the hairy eyeball from the very beginning, raising a skeptical eyebrow.  After I explained and said I would appreciate it if my entire meal were comped, he said they would take care of it and took my bill.  The server then returned (fastest turnaround of the entire evening) and simply handed me a bill for a little over $2.  Ridiculous.  I spoke with the manager again, and was told they can't comp alcohol.  Others with me were overcharged, including a mysterious $1 for ""rocks.""  Could there seriously even be a $1 line item for ice in a drink??!  More delays to get the bills corrected, with the manager--standing next to the phone--contributing atmosphere by yelling ""Telephone!"" into the back while it continued ringing for all to hear.  Can't say that I'd recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-homewood-2?start=60

I simple got up and left.  Nobody didn't bother either to see if anything was wrong either.  This was a horrible experience this time around.  I won't be visiting this Chili's anytime soon if this is what they are doing now, especially when it wasn't slammed with customers this time.

Normally Chili's is a decent place to eat and great for margaritas. This location is HORRIBLE, run away!!!! Waitress is friendly but service is very slow and there were not many patrons. My food took a long time to come out and was luke warm at best. The amount of salt on everything was ridiculous. My broccoli was pale, soggy and very salty. My chicken was like grilled cardboard and my quinoa was cold and oily. It was a healthy option on the menu but in real life nothing about it was healthy.  While eating there was a LIVE adult german cockroach on the wall. The floor was fillthy and nothing seemed clean. My server never came to check on me after eating so I used the self pay option on the table.  My waitress sees me doing the survey while delivering food to a nearby table and runs over to me. Nervously she asks me if I just did the survey. I told her I had. Now she is very concerned and asked if I said I was coming back. I informed her that I gave them poor scores and that no I would never come back. She got really upset and asked why, I explained about the horrible food, the roach, the dirty restaurant and she told me that was disgusting and I should have told her. She asked me to wait so she could get her manager.  I declined because unfortunately I had already eaten the food and I had already paid, there was nothing they could do for me.

The ceilings are covered with dust around vents, the floors dirty, and the baseboards disgusting. Foul odors periodically wafted through the dining room while country music and bad singing came from the kitchen.  I looked over to see the manager leading a sing-a-long with the staff as they stood waiting for food that comes out at a snails pace. After waiting 30 minutes for a burger and a flatbread in a mostly empty restaurant, the manager stopped the sing-a-long to ask how everything was.  Finding we had yet to get food she went into the kitchen to reprimand the staff for slow service.  Unfortunately she is seen less as a leader and more like a playmate as she had to call the cook's name three times before he would acknowledge her.   This location should be slamming at this hour with thousands of office workers in a ten minute radius.  Unfortunately they are dying due to lackluster service and a disregard for cleanliness.  The health rating was a 92 and frankly I have no idea how or why.  The longer you look around, the more grime and dust you see. The burger was ordered medium, it came out well.  It was missing the jalepeño slices and jack cheese mentioned on the menu.  My wife's flatbread was fine.  Normally I would have sent the burger back to get the missing ingredients but in this place, I thought that was a bad idea.   The manager comped one of our meals without asking due to the long wait and noise coming from the kitchen.
