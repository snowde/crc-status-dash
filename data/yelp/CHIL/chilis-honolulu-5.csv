Gina H.,"Honolulu, HI",183,91,230,4.0,1/8/2018,Very nice experience at lunch thanks to bartender Kelly (sp?). She was very busy serving the bar and tables but still had a smile on her face.  She answered questions and made us feel cared for.  She is the main reason for the extra star. Lol Don't forget to check in for free chips and queso.  They have the best chips and salsa. Queso just blah.  We ordered the triple sampler.  You have a choice of 3 different. Chicken crispers are a must.  I usually like the egg rolls but they were extra smoky today.  My bf said the bacon burger was delicious. Fries were thick cut and fried well.  I had the quesadilla explosion salad and that was soo ono!! Lots of chicken and totally worth it. If you are worried about calories ask for the dressing on the side.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.  Don't forget to check in on yelp for your free chips and queso dip.  Chili's please don't get rid of the chips and salsa for checking in.  They are my favorite.  Thin and crispy pieces of heaven.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5
Clint I.,"Honolulu, HI",1,4,2,1.0,1/4/2018,Chili's to go slowest thing in the world.  Slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow Also thanks for not adding the chipotle sauce. Awesome job Would be nice to order bbq chicken crispers and actually get bbq sauce.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5
Blake A.,"Honolulu, HI",2,126,334,5.0,12/4/2017,"So after my last visit I was contacted by Chili's general manager, Alicia, regarding my last experience.  She assured me that what I experienced did not meet their expectations and welcomed me back for another meal.   My next visit did not disappoint.  Servers Alex and Mark were excellent and provided great service. They both had very friendly attitudes and made sure me and my wife got everything we needed.  We got the chips and salsa with queso and chicken enchilada soup. I never tried the queso or chicken enchilada soup with the chips before but they were excellent.  The manager on duty, Kate, recommended it and it will now be a go to when I eat here.  For entrees, I order my usual, steak and chicken fajitas, while the wife ordered the Cajun Alfredo pasta with chicken.  The food was very tasty as usual and came out quickly.  We were checked on throughout the meal by our servers, as well as Kate, to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  After the meal, dessert was considered but we both were too full and regretfully passed. I really hold Chili's in high regards for the way they went out of their way to make sure me and my wife had a positive experience at their restaurant.  Alicia, Kate, Alex, and Mark provided me and my wife with not just a meal, but with a memory that we will remember for a lifetime. Even though Chili's is a nationwide ""chain"" restaurant, I feel that they really value their customers like a family owned restaurant.  I have memories of visiting Chilis with my parents and am now currently doing it with my wife. I will be a loyal patron to this restaurant and hopefully bring my kids here one day so we can continue to support a restaurant that has values.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5
Susanne K.,"Honolulu, HI",57,98,708,1.0,11/12/2017,"It's been a while since FPO and I were here. Things have apparently gone down hill since our last visit. Incorrect food on our order and hair in the food. Maybe we should have gone to The Counter ... Add On: after finding the hair in our food and reporting it to our server (I think I heard him called Rodney, he never introduced himself) he went and got his manager, Alicia. She came over to our table to apologize for the hair and to assure us that Chili's has quality checks in place that usually catch these things. . Unfortunately, she was unaware of the first problem - that we ordered the Triple Dipper with Big Mouth Bites and not the Southwestern Egg Rolls. And that after being informed, Rodney took the plate back to the kitchen, dumped the egg rolls and brought back the plate with the rest of th food saying the kitchen would correct our order.  Alicia offered to get us something else to eat. (Considering what happened with this experience we declined.) She comped our drinks and gave us gift certificates and her business card saying if we give Chili's (any Chili's) another chance to make sure we give her card to our server so that they can involve the manager on duty and make sure to make our next visit superb.  While Alicia's follow through was appreciated and her offer very generous, after talking it over with FPO we are in agreement - it's going to be a long time before we go to any Chili's restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5
Ray L.,"Honolulu, HI",29,347,11148,3.0,9/23/2017,"Came in for a Saturday night dinner and the place was humming with people.  I checked in with Yelp and got my free chips and queso which is always great.  This time the chips were very greasy and a clump of them were stuck together.   We ordered a chipotle chicken bowl which is my fav go to.  The other dish ordered was the chicken enchilada with a sub for corn on the cob instead of beans.   Tawny served the food to us and to our surprise the beans were served instead of the corn.  We informed Tawny of the sub and her response was ""well, this dish is served as is"".  I told her that if that was the case, we would have been told by our server.  Thankfully our server came by and straightened out everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5
Chelsea S.,"Honolulu, HI",10,42,237,4.0,10/10/2017,"When you're at Kahala and don't want to wait 2 hours for CPK, don't discount Chili's as a place to eat. You'd be surprised how many people they can actually seat because the wait is almost never longer than 5 minutes. I've been here several times in the past and although this isn't a go-to restaurant, I always leave pretty satisfied.  Don't forget to Check-In with Yelp to and get free Chips and Queso. They are generous and it was a great appetizer. The food here is great! I've had their smothered burrito and other tex-mex combo dishes (when they had it) and it was delicious! My last visited entailed me ordering the Margarita Grilled Chicken and my boyfriend ordering the Triple Dipper appetizer as his meal. My grilled chicken was very interesting! The chicken had a nice sweet margarita sauce that was complemented well with the crunchy tortilla strips, pico de gallo, black beans and rice. The portions are enough to satisfy but not overkill. My boyfriend's Triple Dipper looked very yummy. The sauce for the chicken was quite strong and this may be good for some and maybe not for others. However, we were satisfied with the overall quality, taste, and portions. The staff working there is very accommodating and gives great service. They work very hard and do a wonderful job balancing all the customers they serve - props to that. Overall, don't count Chili's out. They have great food, a nice variety of menu selections, a well-kept facility, and accommodating staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5
Jeffrey A.,"Honolulu, HI",260,78,112,3.0,9/13/2017,"While watching some tv, there was a Chili's ad and then that prompted us to try it out. It's been a while since I've been in a Chili's and it was the perfect opportunity to grab a drink.  It was a saturday and it was pretty crazy.  After taking a look at the menu, I decided to get a skinny margarita and my bf decided to get a watermelon cooler.  His cooler was too sweet for my taste, but my skinny margarita tasted like I was drinking juice.  I think they should've relaxed on added too much sweetner.  I forgot I was drinking alcohol.   I was randomly check in on yelp, and there was a free chips and queso combo to redeem.  I wasn't going to say anything, until one of the waiters caught a glimpse on my phone and gave us the free chips and dip. He ordered the chicken crispers and I got the bacon avocado sandwich with grilled chicken.  His chicken crispers were pretty good, but my sandwich was oil.  I have no idea why I had a lot of oil on my bread, but it was okay.  The fries were okay but I was more into the chips than the fries.   Overall, this place is okay.  The service exceeds the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5
Marc Y.,"Honolulu, HI",47,71,171,3.0,6/29/2017,"Spotted a Chili's advertisement while strolling inside Kahala Mall which features their two new seasonal Watermelon alcoholic drinks.  This really caught our eyes and opted to head to Chili's to give it a try.   We both started with the new Watermelon Cooler, and enjoyed our drinks, as it is refreshing, tasting like a watermelon soda.  Happy with our drinks, we proceeded to share the Quesadilla Explosion Salad, another new item, and their infamous Chicken Crispers.  The Quesadilla Explosion Salad blew our minds.  This salad consists of sliced grilled chicken breast with cheese, diced tomatoes, house-made cilantro corn relish, crispy tortilla strips, a drizzle of ancho-chile ranch sauce & citrus-balsamic dressing and served with freshly toasted 3-cheese quesadillas.  The taste and freshness of the salad was perfect. Service at Chili's, in the past, has been spotty, but the food has always been pretty consistent.  The host was friendly, and our waiter was pretty attentive.  This was a good Chili's stop. Stop in and try their new menu items.  They are a change from the ordinary, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5
Javier T.,"Honolulu, HI",3,104,79,5.0,12/12/2017,Consistently good! I can't complain too much about chili's I mean for a mainland business they are on point and there is NO difference between Hawaii  and mainland chili's! Had a great server! Great experience!

Charisse T.,"Honolulu, HI",43,98,382,4.0,5/28/2017,"I'm not sure if it was a change in management or if we just got really lucky. The last two times I came here the service and experience was great. I mean free stuff is always good to me.  We came here because we wanted to go somewhere to eat out last minute and the wait for CPK was nearly an hour... I was hungry and couldn't wait that long. So we came to chilis. It was busy but the wait was less than an hour so I was sold. I ordered the 3 items for $15.99 deal (salad, chicken fajita and molten yum!). I was told they were out of the mini molten :( but that they would be giving a free upgrade to the regular size because of it. Yes! Bf ordered his food and a cup of soup. They ended up messing it up and bringing an additional cup for free on accident. The soup was warm if that though. Meh but hey it's free. Service was good especially since they hooked it up.  Fast forward to a few nights later (birthday dinner). Great service again. One of us ordered steak and the server said she would check to see if it was the right size since it looked a little tiny. Come to find out she was right. It was the 6 oz instead of the 10 oz. so to make up for it they gave an extra 6 oz steak for free. Nice! We also got an extra fries for free. Not sure if these were just outlier occurrences but it definitely bumped chilis up on my list for last minute restaurant choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5

FOOD: Let me just start by saying this time around I am actually VERY impressed by the menu! I had the shrimp/sirloin chipotle thingy except I subbed the asparagus for the Mexican street corn, and bruh! I seriously can't even tell you how amazing that corn was! My steak was cooked to perfection and the flavors OH MY GOSH. If you can believe it, it was out of  t h i s W o r l d! Lol my dad had the exact same thing as me and he loved it also. My husband had the build your own fajita and he really liked it. My brother and mom had some other chicken dishes and they loved it as well. Everyone kept talking about how great the flavors were and how well it just all came together. My mom, husband and I all had Margaritas and that too was also super delish.  Service: I wish I got our servers name, he was very attentive, he always came around to ask if we were okay, also to re fill our drinks. He removed plates fast when we were done with them.

Alexander G.,"Honolulu, HI",465,620,3293,4.0,3/27/2017,"There's something so simple and fun about corporate restaurants; you always know what  you're going to get. My favorite has always been Chili's due to their Mexican inspiration. It's a friendly neighborhood bar and restaurant; the host staff, bartenders, and waitstaff are all professional and friendly to ensure you have a good time. Our recent waiter David and the manager went out of their way to make sure we were happy, especially helping solve a problem with the orders we didn't even notice right away. With the closing of the Waikiki location, Kahala has been my go-to whenever I'm in the mood for their food. I've eaten here many times, sometimes at the bar, others at booths and tables. It's most fun to eat here with a group as the food is great for sharing. Portion sizes are consistent and not small. Prices aren't cheap nor expensive; you're getting what you're paying for. I always think the meats and vegetables are fresh, dishes are tasty and well seasoned. The menu is long, there's something for everyone. Be sure to pay attention to whatever specials are going on! For Yelp check-in, you get free chips and queso, so be sure to do that for some pre-dinner munchies.  They have an okay selection of draft beer and can make most typical hard drinks at the bar. This location is a stand-alone building on the Kahala Mall grounds. You can easily walk here from inside the mall, or park right next door for free. They have ample seating indoors and out. Restrooms are large and clean. The ambiance is fun, dark tile, with dim lighting. Fun place for comfort food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5

She always made sure everyone in her section was doing well, refilled drinks asap, and has an all around amazing personality!   Anyways not complaining just confused!! Hahahaha!! This location is closest for me, and every time I've come here I've never been disappointed. We've always been seated on the left side, aka bar side, this is where happy hour occurs. And even though there's only the bartenders and probably two or three other people working this side, everything goes over really smooth.  I've noticed there's always a manager walking around making sure people's visits are great, and if not she makes accommodations.  You can never go wrong with choosing fajitas from here! They're packed with veggies and nice slices of meats! Also their burgers seem to never fail as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5

Jerry E.,"Honolulu, HI",11,274,1172,5.0,3/13/2017,"Well, the manager, Alicia, earned my 5 star review for her attention to customer's feedback. Previous shortcomings, in my view, were rectified in my recent visit. The chips were fresh, warm, and delicious, complemented with bottomless tasty sauce; these alone are worth eating in this fine establishment.  Also, the wraps that comes with fajita were outstanding and the best part is that they do not turn hard, like other places,  after exposing to air for a period of time; the shrimp and prime combo is hard to beat. Thank you, Alicia! Please keep up the fantastic work! Update: Another memorable experience at one of my favorite places. Just couldn't get enough of their absolutely delicious chips & fajita dish.  Liked their steak much better than prime rib for the fajita because the customer can request how the steak is cooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5
Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",378,724,4179,4.0,2/5/2017,"I visited this location this past weekend for the first time in almost two years, and it was nice to observe some updates/improvements: 1)  The interior has been given a much needed facelift and renovations.  Everything from the light fixtures to the tables and booths seems to be show room new(in the main restaurant area).  With these improvements, the center of the room looks vastly larger than it really is creating a wide open space. 2)  The entrees are now mostly served on actual plates and not the formerly used basket-lined with wax paper method.  I ordered the big mouth bites and it was served on a regular plate with the fries in a metallic basket.  Nicely done upgrade/improvement for sure.  Though I'm guessing there are more dishes to be done as well. 3)  There was a miniature device/computer at our booth which we used to pay our bill.  The server was kind enough to offer to split our bill three ways, and each party was able to pay their own share (including the tip) on this device.  Extremely convenient.  Cards only please.  4)  Service was pretty awesome.  Our server was very patient and knowledgeable.  Oh, and I mustn't forget polite.  He checked on us periodically throughout the meal, and his observation skills were quite keen as he kindly offered boxes before we asked. BOTTOM LINE:  Noticeable improvements.  Decent food.  Good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5
Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",219,288,1114,5.0,1/17/2017,"Take my review with a grain of salt (no literally, the new Salted Caramel Molten is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!) SERVICE: Starting with our waiter Bo who's first day was today, was very attentive always checking on us, refilling our beverages, asking if everything was alright and if we needed anything. Also we didn't even know that our food was taking longer than expected until Kate one of the managers on duty tonight came out to let us know that it was coming out soon (she even offered to upgrade our desserts) which we really appreciated this!! FOOD: The CARNITAS FAJITAS were really oishii (delicious)!! The pork itself was nice tender and full of flavor. Loved the tortillas and condiments tray that came with it so that I could custom it to my tastes. Before I start talking about the SALTED CARAMEL MOLTEN I must admit that I usually hate caramel but this dessert is definitely an exception. It reminded me of a warm deep fried Twinkie (which I love but this was much better) with the ice cream being a bonus.  PARKING: Limited handicap parking. There is only 2 handicap parking in front of Chili's and 1 in front of CPK. None were available this time but we were able to find a spot very close by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5

Tonight we were served by Courtney and Dalaney. They were on top of everything, we weren't really sure who was our server because they both refilled our drinks and checked up on us. They even brewed us a fresh pot of coffee. Our steak was overcooked but it was quickly corrected and we were offered a side salad to compensate. They remade our steak very fast and the manager came over and talked to us (guy with glasses and bright green shirt). I was impressed with their customer service.

We were seated right away, and the waitress came right away to see if we wanted to start off with some drinks. We got some mango teas and soft drinks since they were unlimited refills which is good for kids. Lol  I got the smokehouse combo which came with so much things. It came with garlic bread, corn , French fries, pickled cucumber, ribs and jalapeño smoked sausage. I was super happy with my order. I got full off of it and it tasted great. My boyfriend got the exact same thing. Some other orders were enchiladas, burgers and a rack of ribs. Everyone was happy with their orders. The waitress was on it. Before anyone could take the last sip of their drink, she was already on her way to refill it for us. Thank you!  We could not past up dessert.

Melina P.,"Honolulu, HI",38,169,330,5.0,1/9/2017,"I'm not sure how I've never written a review for this Chili's when I come here fairly often! It happens to be at a very convenient location for the majority of my friends & myself so it's an easy option when we want to get together, last minute & nobody wants to drive far.  We all tend to order the same thing every time we come & in 6yrs of visiting, I can't ever recall receiving bad food or bad service. We all love their margaritas & desserts as well. We always order & share & always end up with the molten chocolate cake or the warm, gooey chocolate chip cookie served with vanilla ice cream in a skillet. At our most recent visit, we noticed they had a new salted caramel molten cakes so we tried that instead. I loved it but couldn't eat much because I was so full from dinner. A few friends mentioned it was ""too sweet"" for their liking so unless you REALLY love sweets like me, consider this your warning.

We arrived and there was no host at the front and when a host came by we were not greeted, we were just greeted by ""who was here first"" with the motion of a hand indicating us to follow the host.  Following that it took quite sometime for us to just get water and then another 7-10 minutes to order the food. Never got refills immediately. And it took over 20-30 minutes for our food. No one told us there was an issue as we just heard from other servers actually communicating their patrons.  Never the less, when my big mouth bites came... it was terrible. It wasn't cut in four sandwiches and my fries did not come. Only did my fries arrive when I finished my food. I was just disappointed in the food as I go to chilis often with family and friends.

Kristine C.,"Honolulu, HI",899,443,8393,4.0,3/24/2017,"The last time I remembered visiting a Chili's was before the Waikiki location closed and if it hadn't closed, I'd more than likely eat there once a month. Alexander has been craving Chili's for quite some time and we finally gave it a go. Chili's in Kahala is hard to miss with their location being in the same property as Kahala Mall next to Whole Foods on Waialae Avenue. If I'm going to any restaurant chain, a surf and turf is my first go to. My family and I came on a weekday during spring break and the venue wasn't thankfully busy. We were immediately seated on an open high booth and next to the glass divide with the view of the bar. The bar houses a few TV screens angled on all directions for everyone to see. This would be a great bar for sports watching, drinking while socializing. The venue is comfortable with countless booths, and adjustable tables. The large Hawaii murals and colorful drinking glasses as light fixtures broadcasted an impression that you're indeed at a Chili's restaurant in Hawaii. David was our server for the evening and we had an offer for a free chips and salsa with guacamole or cheese. We chose the guacamole and it's not guac from a mixed package, it was real with chunks of tomatoes, bits of onions, cilantros. The chips were warm and fresh and we had two rounds of it. While the beverage menu is eclectic with cocktails and beers, I was hoping to have a virgin lava flow. But the bar couldn't make it. David returned and offered a virgin daiquiri and it was immensely sweet and good. The menu has an overwhelming selection of appetizers and mains with fries, wings, eggrolls, flatbreads, pasta, fajitas, seafood and steaks, and ribs. With a few customizations to the options, you can create your own perfect meal. I wanted the Honey-Chipotle Shrimp & Sirloin with asparagus, and loaded mashed potatoes. Alicia the general manager communicated with us that our meal would come out shortly and indeed it did. Our meal had a little bit of mix ups but was solved quickly. Initially I wanted my steak to be a medium rare and I got just what I had ordered. I had requested to have the steak be cooked a little more and David was very kind to take it back to the kitchen. The steak came back even better and melted like butter. The mashed potatoes were tasty and the asparagus was perfect. Due to the mix up I was happy to have inherited the extra corn and it was cooked just right without it sitting on the boiling water for a long time. I had a sample of ribs and it was delightfully tasty. She looked like she went to town and wiped the bone clean to the last cartilage. The quality of the meal is fair to the price and I wouldn't mind returning again to try the ribeye. The device on the table is entertaining with trivia for $1.99, survey options as well as an option to pay with your credit card. David stayed on top of his game and was never too busy to fill cups of waters and to chat a while. His manager asked that we leave a survey on the device at the table and we did just that. David left a lasting impression on us that night when we told him we would leave an honest survey. David said, ""The truth is better than lying no matter what it is.""

Elston F.,"Honolulu, HI",240,58,698,4.0,5/26/2017,Chilis Kahala which is next to Kahala Mall is a convenient place to come and grab a drink or bite to eat. Usually in the early afternoons there is no crowd and they have happy hour specials. There is a lot of parking and the wait staff is friendly. Sometimes they can get busy and drinks/food can take a while.

Tasha M.,"Honolulu, HI",81,133,90,4.0,9/19/2016,"First time at this place and I'd say it was a good one. I was happy w/ their Yelp check-in offer. The chips and queso is free w/ a check-in which I appreciate because typically places offer $1 off for their Yelp check-ins, but the Chilis check-in offer is great as the check-in offer is totally free!  Our server was nice and friendly. I ordered the chicken wings which I believe is an appetizer so we got it $2 off (I think) because it was Happy Hour. My sister got the Mac and cheese side along w/ a chili side. She was a bit disappointed that the chili came w/or rice though. We also ordered the cake/ice cream dessert (I forget the actual name). It was yummy and filling, so we actually weren't able to finish it all.  You make payment via the machine that's right on your table. Convenient!

Jada C.,"Honolulu, HI",158,281,2189,2.0,8/29/2016,"Convenience played a key to our coming to Chili's. After shopping at Whole Foods, we decided to stop over here for lunch. Unfortunately, it resulted in a bad decision.  We like coming to Chili's. However, I think the change in the kitchen staff made a huge difference. I ordered the guacamole burger. It tasted too salty and way too spicy. I was hungry. I tried to eat it but it got worse. I felt the salt stay on my tongue and it made me feel uncomfortable. I took sips of root beer but that did not make a difference. The fries tasted salty too. It made me think that the chef wanted to preserve the left over food from yesterday.  I told our server of what happened. He quickly took the fries back and gave me a new one. I told him of what happened to the burger. He asked me if I wanted a new one. I looked at my half eaten burger and said no.  Needless to say, I felt a bit unnerved about the whole issue. Our server told the manager and he came out to apologize for the situation. I explained to him the issue. He said he will comp me for the meal. He said he will speak for the fry cook about it.  For the whole day, I felt a bit uneasy because of the high salt intake. Not a good way to leave Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=20

But their was another worker who came to us and seated us.  Our waitor was nice. Came in often to check on us, but idk if were suppose to ask for napkins or he forgot? I need more napkins for desserts, & I he forgot, but not a biggie. But I need napkins especially with the kids lols.  Another downside was that they only had 1 pasta dish & it was cajun pasta. Im not a huge fan of spicy. I can handle a little but not a lot, so I didnt know how spicy it was. I asked the waitor how spicy it was, but he didnt know as well since he hasnt tried it  I did however like the fact that their keikis menu was 1 same price for all; unlike othet restaurant, it varies. The food was AMAZING!!!  Chicken quesadilla was good!! Not oily and3 the crisp on the tortilla was perfect. And it waa ready to eat, not hot hot.  Bf ordered the steak, he loves it! Not much cooks can cook steak the way he likes it.  Surprisingly, the kids ate all the food! I like the amount given, just right!   Desserts was SOO GOOD!! I ordered the berrys with cake & ice cream. Omg it was good!! The others enjoyed their desserts too  It is kinda pricey (minus the kids meal) when you have a big family, but it is WORTH IT!! Everything was delicious.

Nada C.,"Tacoma, WA",44,117,163,3.0,3/23/2017,"In Washington Chilis always plays a ton of commercials and we don't even have a real chilis. The only chilis we have is at SeaTac airport and it's not even the same. So when we got to Oahu we saw chilis and immediately said yup let's go.  I've been to 1 other chilis before and that was in Denver. I remember it being amazing and all the commercials that always play at home makes me crave that ish.  So anyways it wasn't as good as I remembered. The group I was with felt the same so this is a kind of a group review. The food was just okkkk....  The chicken crispers weren't really crispy. The steak I ordered had a weird sauce and the steak wasn't even that juicy. It was supposed to be medium but more like well done. The shrimp that it came with was tiny and salty. The salsa and chips were probably the best thing we ate. You get a free chips salsa and queso if you check in on Yelp!  We all felt that the service and waiter Kevin was great. He even gave us to go chips and salsa. All in all, chilis, it was ok kind of like applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=40

Michael K.,"Honolulu, HI",36,8,28,5.0,11/15/2017,"*Before I start my review, I just want to put in that I do not usually do reviews for large chain restaurants. As I said earlier, this is a very unexpected review for me, but the service that I received definitely made this review an exception. I go to Chili's enough where I already have an expectation of food quality, service, and atmosphere. The environment is usually loud, the food is alright, and from my earlier visits, the service was below par compared to other large chain restaurants. I went in with two other friends on Veteran's Day because we were looking at the sales for the stores at Kahala Mall. I was expecting it to be busy and for the service to be slow, but my friends really wanted to go to eat there. I was served by two ladies, Courtney and I believe the other girl's name was Laney. They were friendly even in the loud environment, serving us with a smile, and I really appreciated that. Our table decided to start with some appetizers. We ordered the Texas Cheese Fries and Chips and Salsa, along with some soft drinks. It was time to order, but I usually like to ask for suggestions just to see if maybe I will try something new. I usually go for the Old Timer Burger with Cheese. You cannot go wrong with a burger, and Chili's burgers are pretty decent. Courtney suggested a couple of items. She suggested the ribs , the Southern Smokehouse Burger, and the Cajun Chicken Pasta. She gave great descriptions on all the items, which I never knew about beforehand. For the first time there, I was stumped on what to order. My friends went first, getting the Steak Fajitas and Margherita Flatbread. I was indecisive at first, but I was pleasantly surprised that Courtney did not try to rush me. She told me to just let her know when I have decided, and she started asking my friends about why we were in the area and if we were from here, and other small talk. This made me pleasantly surprised, knowing that our waiter was definitely personable. While this was going on Laney came out with our appetizers, which I thought was very fast. I finally decided on the Southern Smokehouse Burger. Courtney closed up the conversation politely and left to put our order in. We only waited about 8-10 min for our food, and in that time Laney did not fail in making sure our drinks were filled. I never once had to think about if I needed to ask for a refill, which is very comforting for me. Our food came out steaming, and I was definitely pleased with my meal. My burger's sauces were amazing. There was a special sauce inside, a bbq sauce to dip in, and the onion rings were great. My friends seemed to enjoy their food as well, but I was too focused on my food. I was impressed when Laney came over to ask our table if we were okay, and then asked me if the burger was alright, or if I wanted to get something else instead. This showed that Courtney communicated to her that this was my first time ordering the burger, and that was very commendable. At the end of our meal (our drinks still did not go empty by the way) we were way too full for dessert. I paid through the Ziosk, which is very convenient, and we left a generous tip showing our appreciation for the great service. We all decided that whenever we go to that Chili's, we would ask for Courtney or Laney because of the great impression they left. This experience changed my whole perception on Chili's. I do hope that eventually they get promoted/rewarded for their teamwork, hospitality, and great customer service. Thank you again Courtney and Laney, my friends and I greatly appreciate your work ethic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=40

Mae F.,"Honolulu, HI",126,70,516,3.0,7/31/2016,"We usually stop here to fuel up for a day of snorkeling at Hanuama Bay.  The triple dipper is a huge plate of 3 appetizers and 3 dips.  It probably has a billion calories in it, just enough to fuel us for a fun day of snorkeling.  Pictured on the menu are 2 hamburger sliders, fried cheese balls, and southwestern style egg rolls.  I substituted boneless buffalo chicken wings for the cheese balls.  The service is always warm and friendly.  I didn't give this place 3 stars because the food was bad; rather because this is a place to fuel up on fried foods and then leave.  The food comes out fast, which is a good thing if you have French fry loving kids, and the prices are very reasonable for Hawaii.  If I wanted a true dining experience, however, I'd go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=60

Fran C.,"Honolulu, HI",460,954,11214,4.0,2/17/2015,"Are you a fan of rich NASTY food? Why, YES...........I AM! Lol!  Sometimes when I'm craving some Nasty Tex-Mex ribs.........I like to go to Chili's at the Kahala Mall Shopping Center. Yeah, the ribs are not the best that I've ever had, but at least they are consistent, and I know what I'm gonna get. They have two styles of ribs - the dry rib, & the bbq ribs. I've tried them both, but prefer the gooier sticky bbq ribs! :D  New on the menu, I hear they now offer a Dr. Pepper BBQ ribs, as well as a Craft Beer ribs too (will have to try that one day). With my ribs they offer several types of sides, but I'm a creature of habit, and I tend to get the same thing over, and over again............if it works, don't fix it right? Lol! I usually get the cinnamon apples, & steam broccoli for my sides.........so basically I'm getting a high calorie, high sugar meal........only to off set it with some healthy steamed broccoli. Well, two out of three ain't bad!  What can I say about the ribs.........tasty bbq flavor, meat on the ribs are not the meatiest, but it will do when I'm craving some ribs. The cinnamon apples are great! It's like eating a apple pie without a pie crust.........so basically your eating the apple pie guts! Lol! And of course the steamed broccoli, it's healthy........but nothing to write home about.  If you saw the Chili's web site on the calorie contents of their foods.............rest a sure, this is comfort food! Not the healthiest of food! The full rack of bbq ribs packs a 1240 calorie punch, and this doesn't include the addition 270 calories, and 24 grams of sugar for the cinnamon apples. For the steamed broccoli..........you know it's healthy as it's just 40 calories. For you folks that like to dine here, (and not feel guilty about it)..........they do offer some healthier fares too...........l saw some lower calorie entrees of fish, or chicken dishes, but you will have to read the menu & choose carefully (unlike me).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=100

Finally he came by to take our food orders. We ordered the beef nachos and a few other appetizers....the food came out fairly quick. Everything was great EXCEPT the nachos!

Andy F.,"Honolulu, HI",63,209,978,4.0,12/15/2015,"*This is from last week's visit* I found my home! I found DolphinNation! I have found my favorite place for NFL Sunday football! Each sports bar has a predominant fanbase of a particular NFL team, Seahawks...ahemm. They are seemingly everywhere, and are quite.....passionate (?), sometimes overly passionate. Though, there was one ""fan"" who rolled in very late, and the Seahwaks game was already out of hand and switched to a better game. After some complaining, she left lol. Bye-bye! Anyway... what makes this place fun and great is the fact the bar area has exactly nine TVs that show every single game rather than the first come, first serve on the TVs and you get the same 2-3 games on all the TVs. The place was comfortable and cool, and clean. The fellow football fans were mellow and laid-back, which is such a welcome. Located in Kahala Mall, there is plenty of parking in the morning. Chili's offers a breakfast menu, but no bar food during that time. Other than the French Toast and Pancakes, everything else has basically the same ingredients served in different vessels. On this morning, we just ordered the Flatbread Sunrise ($10.99). The flatbread comes with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and cheese, and salsa and pico de gallo and cilantro. This may sound ridiculously simple, but it was good. It was like a breakfast pizza! The scramble eggs was the key ingredient that made this a successful dish. Anytime I order eggs, I never think it will turn out the way it's supposed to, especially scrambled eggs. I only hope it's not super dry and overcooked. In this case, the eggs were actually cooked well. It was moist, soft, and warm. The service was average. It seemed like they was short-staffed front and back, so the food took a really long time to come out (unless it was totally forgotten), and we were rarely checked on. Overall, I really enjoyed watching Sunday NFL football here. Other than D&Bs, there's really no other place where you can watch every single NFL game sitting at one spot. The place was nice and comfortable, and the food was good. I'll definitely be coming here at least once before the regular season ends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=80

The server informed me that I can only use the Yelp offer if I purchase an entree, which it does NOT say on the offer. She even checked with the manager and said that they can NOT provide the offer unless I purchase an entree because the register will not let them do that. REALLY??  To the server... You made me feel really bad about asking for the offer. You made me feel very uncomfortable, so I left.  I just wanted a salad and a drink and I can get that at several locations in Kahala Mall.

Every time I go I end up having a worse experience than the time before. This time was the last time that I will give it another chance.  As me and my girlfriend walked in we were not greeted, just stared at until I said something. I then asked the host if it was happy hour, because that would decide if I wanted to sit at the bar or in the dining area, he checked his phone and then said, ""I dont know."" He didn't ask if he should go find out but just stared at me with confusion. I then said we will just sit at a booth. He walked us passed several open booths near the window to then seat us in the very back corner right by the kitchen entrance. Trying to be positive I thought to myself maybe it was this servers turn to get a table and figured we would get our food faster sitting by the kitchen. We then asked one of the servers of it was happy hour and they didn't know either. You would think they would know, but I guess no one cares about making sales.  Our server comes up and is very polite asks us if we knew what we wanted to drink. We order a water and a Bloody Mary. When the Bloody Mary finally comes it looks as if the top 1/3 was just water. Mixed it and it still looked and tasted terrible. We then ordered food. I ordered the crispy crispers with double fries instead of fries and corn on the cob and she orders a margarita flatbread salad with the dressing on the side. The server brings out her salad and says, ""I'm so sorry but the kitchen didn't put the dressing on the side. If you want I can take it back and they can just pull of the salad and replace it."" My girlfriend didn't want to be rude or waste any food so she opted to keep it. And of course there was too much dressing and it wasn't they way she wanted it. My food didn't come for another 6-7 minutes. When it did the server puts it down and says, ""oh looks like they put the corn there as well but there are definitely two sides of fries there"" That was definitely not two sides of fries. I look at the plate and it's the wrong kind of chicken. I ask the server if this is what I ordered, knowing it was not. She replied, ""Oh yah I think they changed the batter and that's how it's made now but I will double check"" She comes back about 5 mins later saying sorry and that I can keep that but they will bring out my original order in just a few minutes. 6-7 more minutes pass and they finally bring the chicken that I ordered still with only one side fries and another corn on the cob. By this time we both have lost our appetite by having such a bad experience we box up our food and leave. And of course on our way out the host just stares at us and doesn't say anything as we leave. Definitely will not be going back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=80

Rena G.,"Honolulu, HI",183,106,655,4.0,3/21/2016,"This review is for the excellent customer service we received at this location from both our server and the manager on the midday-shift last Saturday. So, my husband and I ordered drinks from the bar while waiting for our redeemed offer from Yelp, the check in deal of a free order of chips and queso. He got a beer and me, a strawberry patron margarita. Well, upon his first sip, my husband noticed a rough edge that almost cut his lip open. Upon further inspection of the glass, we noticed that the cup was chipped. We immediately waved down a server to transfer the remaining beer into another glass. She apologized and went off to do the exchange. We weren't trying to make it a big deal or anything, so when the manager came out to serve the newly filled chilled glass and personally apologize for the incident himself, it was a nice surprise. He even filled it all the way to the top with freshly drafted beer instead of just transferring the original fill to another cup. After that, we were waited on by both server and manager as if we were some VIP guests for the duration of our meal. They both really made this visit a pleasant one considering it could have been a negative experience had they not handled the incident well. Then, this review would have turned out completely different! But, instead it's left on a positive note thanks to the well-trained staff at this location. Good job on keeping your customers happy :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=80

Kelsi C.,"Honolulu, HI",230,66,89,2.0,5/13/2015,"Located in the shopping complex of Kahala Mall, we decided to stop here tonight for dinner, since we were in the area. As expected, the ambience is very American Bar Casual.  It's also very loud, and we had to shout in order to communicate with the hostess.  We had to wait for a bit, as this was during the dinner rush, and it was quite busy.   We started off with the guacamole, which they prepare near your table.  The guacamole was well, guacamole.  Nothing special, but definitely not bad.  It's a great appetizer to munch on, while chit-chatting with the rest of the folks in your party.   For my main entree, I ordered the chicken enchiladas.  The chicken enchiladas confused me, especially since the plate itself was HOT.  You could've melted plastic on it!  The waitress even handed it to me using a pot holder.  However, when I cut into it, the enchiladas were cold.  Not ice-cold, but they were definitely not hot or warm.  I notified the waitress of this, in which she apologized and offered to take it back for me.  When the food came back, this time the rest of the enchiladas were hot, and so was the rice.  I guess their microwave decided to work again.   All in all, don't waste your time here, unless there's nothing else in the area to eat.  The food tastes as if it's from frozen, and it appears that all they do is heat a plate and throw the frozen food on there.  I mean, the plate's hot enough to defrost the food anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=140
Traci T.,"Honolulu, HI",253,119,2233,3.0,4/28/2015,"My mom, grandma, and I often come to this location on Saturdays for lunch.  It's near where my grandma lives and we often have a discount that I'm urging to use.  The service varies...sometimes quick and sometimes obnoxiously slow.   B. Kaulana is THE server to have whenever you visit here.  She is absolutely amazing!  We don't come here every week, nor do we have her every visit...yet somehow she manages to memorize our exact order everytime we come!  She is always on top of it and very hospitable whenever we visit.  There is no other server there like her.   Discounts: 1.  Are you signed up to receive Chili's emails?  If you're not, you're missing out!  The first email they send you will give you a coupon for a free chips and salsa/guacamole/queso.  Emails that are sent to you after that are often for free appetizers, desserts, or kid's meals.  The junk part is that most of the time the discounts are only good from Monday - Thursday.  Every once in a while you'll get a weekend discount.  This past weekend, I actually got a text from Chili's and received a free appetizer coupon through the text.  Didn't get it through email.   2.  Do you have an iDcard?  I like to use this discount card whenever I'm craving Chili's, but they didn't send out a coupon in an email.  The iDcard gives you $5 off a purchase of $25.  Don't know what the iDcard is?  What planet are you from?!?!?  Check out   for more details.  You're missing out on some great deals! Whenever we come here, I always order the regular guacamole and chips.  Yum, yum, yum!  It also comes with salsa.  My mom and I also order the California Turkey Club.  We split it and they are always nice to put our order on two separate plates so we don't have to split it ourselves.  We usually get a side order of sweet potato fries, which are usually delicious...but on this visit, we were told that they discontinued the sweet potato fries.  WHAT?!?!?!??!  That's the reason for a drop in stars.  Boo to you Chili's!  Our server even said that it's a popular item, but they still discontinued it.  Bring it back!  I don't even mind paying the extra $0.50 for it!   If you pay with a credit card, the servers are instructed to tell you to pay with the Ziosk machines that are left on your table.  These machines are a fancy distraction for those who patron the establishment.  You can pay to play games or use other various apps on the machine.  It's like a tablet.  I think these things are a waste of table space, but I can see the convenience.  Just swipe and your receipt is printed out.  There's also a tool that allows you to calculate the tip for you.  The junk thing about these receipts though is that they don't register on my Shoparoo app that gives me points for places that I spend money.  For some reason, whenever I take a picture of my receipts from these Ziosk machines, Shoparoo says it's an invalid receipt.  I never had this issue with the regular checks I used to get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=140

I must say service could have been quicker but as a large group walking in a half hour before closing, they did an awesome job in accommodating us. The watermelon cooler was nice, strong enough but not too strong for a ""light weight"" like myself (not real weight, lol!).  The chicken enchillda with sour cream was also really yummy as was the taco. The tostada wasn't anything special and probably wouldn't chose that one again for the pick 2 or 3 mexican dish.

He attended to us, he gave us extra napkins, refills on water timely and got us exactly what we ordered. Yes some of this may sound like that's what he is suppose to do but he did it on point. We have been getting pretty bad customer service at some locations, so to get amazing customer service here after a really rough day at work was good for us. We ordered drinks, southwestern egg rolls, a burger and pasta. Everything was delicious! Chilis has always been a favorite but coming back again and getting the outstanding experience we got reminded us why we love them so much. Kevin was so great to even call over a manager right away to help us establish if we paid our bill since the machine on the table didn't print out a copy of our receipt.

Our waiter was very patient with us, (we were a party of 8) and for most of us this was our first time in a Chili's restaurant. There were so many choices to choose from, it took us awhile to decide what we wanted to order. In the meantime our waiter takes our orders for drinks, he brings four of us ours, then we ask where the rest of the drinks are, and he says the bartender is making them, um......the missing drink was a coke, how hard is it to make that? My niece ordered a budlite-rita (a margarita with a little bud light bottle stuck in the drink)...as the waitress is bringing it to the table she spills the drink not on one but two of us...by then half the drink is gone, and she plops it on the table and walks away....I told my niece to be sure to tell the waitress that she will only pay for half the drink since  that's all that was left in the cup! Anyway, back to the food, I had the chicken quesadilla which was really delicious, my son had the bacon burger sliders, my brother had the ribs, which he said was ok, but for the price should've been a lot better. My sisters had the salad one said it was really delicious, the other said it was ok! The chips and salsa were really good.We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip, which seemed a bit pricey and we didn't get any chips or bread to eat with it, so I am not quite sure why they call it a dip if there is nothing to dip with...Overall the service was ok..food was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=160

I took my mom there on her birthday at the end of December.  I had a newborn and my two year old and it was a very busy saturday night.  The host/hostess gave us a perfect table in the corner where there was plenty of space to put the baby carrier.  The service was really excellent and we left happy. I went for drinks about two weeks ago.  It was not busy at all.  Our server just really sucked.  She would disappear for long periods of time.  My friend had to ask several times for things.  And really...if someone orders coffee, isn't cream and sugar on the side kind of obvious??  My friend waited so long her coffee got cold and she asked for another cup and omg the server did not like that, what attitude!!   Sadly, I will go back again to this one but just hope I don't get the same server!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=160

Kettriah V.,"Honolulu, HI",11,11,19,5.0,3/21/2016,"We are regulars at this place. I tell you what. Every payday we treat ourselves out to Chili's because the customer service is SO amazing! They are so great, and you can't beat the prices. But thats not all.. First- The food and drink. I am a vegetarian, like super hardcore strict vegetarian. I absolutely cannot have any meat or meat broth in my food or I get super nauseous. So, because of that I often times find it hard to eat out. I can say this establishment is very vegetarian-friendly. I either order a meatless flatbread, black bean burger, meatless cajun pasta, or a burrito without meat. They accommodate my needs so well. With the burrito, they will put it extra vegetables (including avocados) to replace the meat. The beers are great, I recommend having a beer -or 4- during happy hour, just don't drink and drive, please! I love to go there and watch the games during football season. By the way, the Molten Lava Cake is bomb. Seriously, get it, you won't be sorry. Customer Service! They are awesome. There has been 3 times where my family has gone and my husband's hamburgers was undercooked or my flatbread was burnt. They are so quick to correct that. Just recently my husband's burger was underdone, we let our waiter know, and he came back with his manager not even 5 minutes later and they gave us 50% off his entree, we were genuinely surprised. We gave the 50% they took off the entree back in a tip, pay it forward a little bit. There has been times where I was in tears at the booth (bad news that day) and they helped turn that around. I could go on and on about their customer service, but I won't. Atmosphere. They recently renovated, and the ambiance is great. The booths are chairs are beautiful. You can come in and immediately feel relaxed. I also enjoy sitting outside -when the weather permits-. They have live music (on Fridays?) and it's a really great feel aside from being on a road of a busy mall, and that's totally okay. Great place, I recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good time and a place that is willing to accommodate YOU.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=180

Most of the food is greasy and heavy, filled with the same ingredients in just about every 40-odd items on the menu.

Also good for groups of people too - especially when at the Kahala location where there are few options for dining.   On this particular night, we rolled in with a group of 6 and were able to get seats right away. Our server was friendly though a little scattered, but I noticed she was covering a lot of tables.  We were there for drinks and pupus - for the most part it was great.  I especially like the chips and salsa here, yumm! I think they make the chips in house, they are light and fresh, while the salsa isn't too spicy so its good for everyone. Anyway, the bummer this night was that a friend ordered a drink, when it arrived she thought it didn't have any alcohol in it.  A couple of us tasted it too and confirmed that it didn't taste like it had any alcohol (you know, us being experts on the matter).   When we told the waitress her response was, ""Oh....."" then she walked away!!

Like where are the plates?!? The trays looked something from a cafeteria so they could save money and not like I was eating at a great restaurant. My sister got a salad that looked like it just came out of the bag and did not taste good. The picture in the menu had different lettuce on it and avocados so my sis was like where are the avocados?? We later got avocados on a plate and it looked sad. Very slim small slices also turning brown. Also the bathrooms looked nice but were not well maintained like there was no toilet paper or paper towels so my mom didn't know what to do. Overall, bad experience.

Cammie T.,"Honolulu, HI",4,50,32,2.0,2/28/2015,"I've been a loyal long time customer of this Chili's but I don't want to go back now because of one bartender in particular. I would say  her name but she never even introduced herself to us so all I can do is describe her. She has short hair, tattoos on her arm and is Asian.  She asked us for our drink order and  I got my usual the presidente margarita and it was the worst one I've ever had. After drinking half of our drinks already my husband and I had to track down the bar back to get someone to order for us and it wasn't even that busy! She totally forgot about us. Then after we were done with our meal I put a gift card down to pay. When she came over to pick up the tab she saw the gift card and she grunted as if it was a big hassle for her. (Hey not my fault I was given a gift card) So again she disappears until we finally get her attention to cash us out.  She had an attitude from when we arrived to when we left. We don't know why she had such a bad attitude  when my husband and I were nothing but pleasant with her. All we wanted was a quick and simple dinner.  She acted like we were a burden and was so displeasant and rude to us I almost didn't even want to tip and I'm usually a VERY generous tipper.  Sorry if you actually have to do your job!  This is very unfortunate because Kelly the bartender I usually get is very very nice and I always give 25% and more to her and other bartenders I've had.

Ariana M.,"Honolulu, HI",3048,735,3527,2.0,1/2/2014,"We wanted to celebrate the first day of 2014 with some Margaritas! So we decided to go to chili's for Happy Hour.  Once entering we were seated on the right side of the dinning area. A waitress came and took our drink and appetizer orders.  When we were almost done with our drinks and food, we wanted to order more drinks but was not sure how long happy hour was. So when we asked the waitress and she informed us that Happy Hour prices for drinks and appetizers are only good for the LEFT side of the dinning area.  - THAT'S STUPID -  I was really irritated that no one informed us about the fact that Happy Hour is only good on one half of the room. I was mad that the hostess who sat us didn't ask if we were interested in Happy Hour and I was mad at the waitress for not mentioning if we were only ordering drinks and appetizers that we should sit on the other side of the room to get better prices.  I feel that is bad customer service and makes me not want to come back here.  The Grub. [[ MAC & CHEESE $3.99 ]]   We decided to get the Southwestern mac n' cheese for an appetizer cause we just LOVE mac n' cheese!! :D The one served at Chili's is made with three cheeses, poblanco peppers and toasted bread crumbs! Super tastey! [[ NACHOS $7.99 ]]   Topped with 3-cheese blend, black beans, jalapenos. Also served with house-made pico de gallo & sour cream. We also added fresh guacamole for $1.49. I was actually surprised when this dish came out, because I was expecting, well you know a pile of chips covered in toppings. But the way this one is served was actually surprisingly good too.  [[ BOTTOMLESS TOSTADA CHIPS $4.99 ]] Extra thin corn tostada chips made fresh! These chips are surprisingly addicting. I definitely recommend getting these if you want something to share with friends.  Margarita Partyyyyyy.    [[ TROPICAL SUNRISE MARGARITA ]]   This drink is made with tequila, melon schnapps, pineapple juice and a splash of grenadine.Out of the three margaritas, this one is definitely my favorite.   [[ PLATINUM PRESIDENTE MARGARITA ]] Hand shaken tequila, orange liqeur, brandy and fresh sour.

First we ordered chips with spinach artichoke dip it was brought to our table it was ok it would of been better if the dip was a little hotter meaning temperature. It was more on the cooler side when it should be on the warm side.

Then I ordered a full rack of original ribs with corn on the cob, mashed potatoes with gravy and a side of fully loaded mashed potatoes for my daughter me and my daughter shared the ribs which even that was a joke. The ribs were over cooked to the point it taste like I was eating jerky the flavor was horrible I couldn't even eat it so I put it to the side. I was able to eat the mashed potatoes with gravy and the corn on the cob. My husband kind of enjoyed what he ordered which was some kind of chicken tenders he said it was ok but he would have gotten the sauce on the side instead of having it put on.

Jennifer S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,1.0,4/4/2016,"I tried to give Chili's Kahala Mall a chance after numerous times of messing up our takeout orders, and well I'm regretting it now. Never order the sweet and Smoky Burger if you're not into bacon like I am not. I ordered the sweet Smoky Burger without bacon and low and behold when I open up my order it was full of bacon. I spent the beginning of my meal I was hungry for doing a bacon excavation project then finally I found my burger. I said no bacon and it was almost like a joke with the way they went off on the bacon. Other than that the burger was bland and dry, I was very disappointed. I was thinking where is the sweet and spicy part? If I wanted a regular bacon burger I would have ordered that, and that's not what I ordered. If Chili's could put the energy they have on their baconating the heck out of a Burger on their sauces, we'd be great. Then my friends order of the Chipotle Chicken Crispers were wrong too. She instead got plain chicken crispers, the chicken Crispers weren't even crisp at all, very disappointing, and the fries that came with her order we're stail, as if they were leftover fries that were being passed on from plate to plate all day just so they can save time and money from fresh fries. The only thing in the order and our whole Chili's experience that seem to work out right were the Panko Onion Rings and the friendly staff. I know that people will say why didn't you stop and check your order before you left? Well you pick up your order at the side of a bar that is busy with Margarita fixings and I did not feel like putting my food on a bar floor and sifting through it to see if it was right, so I had to take my chance and see if it was right at home. I was very disappointed even more worse than other times. After spending $31 on two meals for one dinner I was very disappointed especially when it came to what we were expecting. I should have stuck to Burger King and Taco Bell, at least they get the orders right are way cheaper, fresher and their apps work to order online. I'll probably take my chance with Chili's in Pearl City next time, even if it means I have to drive to another town. If that Chili's don't work out like the Kahala one I should just stick with CPK.

Courtney T.,"Honolulu, HI",335,155,141,4.0,6/22/2013,"Whoa. This place hasn't been averaging very good ratings. Yikes.  Hope this review uplifts it a bit! Anyways, considering this isn't my first time here, this place has yet to disappoint me (knock on wood); although, I hope it doesn't plan on doing so in the near future. Some of my go to favorites have been the Sliders (complete with this ranch jalapeno sauce which goes good with the fries), and most recently, their Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers, which I will elaborate in just a moment.   For $14-$15 it is worth the money. There's no small helpings here. My plate came with 5 or 6 chicken pieces with ranch sauce you can dip the chicken in, seasoned corn on the cob (the trick is to use the knife to cut off the kernels so you spare your teeth some stuck corn), and french fries. Definitely is my new favorite. The fries compliment the Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers perfectly since it can have a spicy kick to it, but tanginess and sweetness that the sauce provides. The chicken crispers is still pretty crispy considering being under siege of the honey chipotle sauce, which in itself is pretty amazing! Everything on the plate seemed to work well, and all the flavors went well.  My mom's favorite is the sampler, she got three different things, which were the Southwestern Eggroll, Spinach Artichoke Dip (reminds me of CPK, but richer), and the Sliders (those good ol' sliders!)  One more thing to note was that I was able to score a free flatbread pizza, something that is new on their menu. I had signed up on Chili's to receive emails and alerts, and got an email for a free flatbread. Fast forward to today, I was able to use it, and it wasn't some lame portion like the small portions at CPK that you can get for free, it was the FULL portion. We ended up choosing the California Grilled Chicken Flat Bread Pizza, complete with all the bells and whistles: tomatoes, chicken, cilantro, bacon, and ranch dressing drizzled over, can't forget the avocado wedges! All atop a thin crunchy crust. SO GOOD. Really gives competition to CPK and for a cheaper price ($10.99 for this sucker).  Didn't had room for dessert today, shame on me.

Greg B.,"Honolulu, HI",6,314,,3.0,3/13/2014,"Chili's Grill and Bar is a middle of a road eatery.  The one thing that it has for it comes in the service.  The food and drinks are always prompt.  If one orders the iced tea drinks, there is always a person on hand to refill it, as so long as he/she notices it.  The menu has constantly changed from mostly burgers to fried things to (now) health based meals.  These health based meals are Mexican/pizza or variants on having a vegetable based dish on the side.   The deserts are fair.  Chili's does have a habit of eliminating the dishes that are popular in lieu of cocktails.  It does have an extended alcoholic list.  It is almost never fully crowded and one does get a seat on the restaurant side quickly.  I would recommend this place because of that and the swiftness of service.  The place also serves well as a backup due to a busy timeframe at another eatery. Parking is rather challenging because it's in Kahala Mall and you'll be lucky to get on right near the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=300

Ive honestly never gone to a restaurant where there are no waiters, servers, etc on the floor for 5 - 10 minutes at a time.  Our waitress, a blonde woman... michelle I think, would give us half arsed apologies about the wait, yet never seemed to give a damn about us otherwise. I timed her leaving the floor on one occassion, 12 min to get a fruit punch and one plate of ribs. Are you kidding me!! We constantly ran low on water and I actually had to get up and walk to the host to ask for our check and takeout containers as our waitress disappeared once again. The food itself was pretty good. My burger was pretty good, and the rest of my family didnt have any real complaints for food quality aside from the ridiculous wait. I dont think I'll ever come back and encourage people to stay away from this nightmarish service. Sorry chilis' but you ruined your chance for my family and I.

I asked for my steak to be cooked rare and  it came to my table a white raw piece of rubber that didn't resemble a ribeye.

I ordered their new Mango Chile Chicken which is a grilled chicken breast topped with a mango/tomato/avocado salsa that was a bit tangy, zesty, and slightly spicy. It came with steamed broccoli and rice. This dish was amazing and I wanted seconds! The only bad thing was the portion size. The chicken breast was a tad small compared to the rest of the plate. My friend ordered the Margarita Chicken which was very flavorful and came with marinated chicken breast on top of rice and beans. Honestly, his dish of food (and the chicken itself) was bigger than mine and his dish was a little over a $1 LESS than mine! For dessert, we just had to get the molten chocolate cake after seeing another table getting it. This is simply the most amazing dessert you'll ever have. It's basically chocolate cake (without the frosting) topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped up with drizzles of hot chocolate syrup that dries and becames a chocolate crust around the ice cream.

The main problem with the restaurant is that the service staff is completely disorganized.  I feel like this is why the waitress will often say there are two of them taking care of your table, simply because you won't see one of them for the rest of the night as another one shifts over to take care of requests.  At one point my friend got two more ranch dips than she requested because they both fulfilled the request.  It's not a bad thing, but this problem can definitely impact you in a negative way. I'm a fan of their BBQ chicken and it did not disappoint me when it came in the triple dippers fashion.  I've never had an issue with the food at Chili's save for some of their burgers being overdone, but it is just the service that concerns me.

As for the fare ... Well, I'm a big fan of the Presidente Margarita.  It's a bit weird ... no prices on the drinks menu.  Got to be worried about that, right?  Relax ... at $8.99, you get a generous shaker (2+ pours) of the Presidente Margarita.  It's a keeper.  Add to that the standard, good Chili's fare (burgers, salads, sandwiches all good, not to mention the Mexican stuff, which is maybe not why I would go to Chili's [but maybe that's just me]) and -- did I mention the outdoor eating area? -- you have good value for money.  This is without taking into account your proximity to the Jack Lord bust, just outside of Macy's.  I don't find the service at Chili's slow, but say it was... Wouldn't that be a great time to get your picture taken next to Jack Lord? Book 'em, Dano.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=340

First of all,  from the time we placed our order it took 45 minutes to get a portion of one of our order.

Worst mistake ever,  because I had to wait another 15 minutes for the manager to bring them.  And the reason it took so long is because she was in the  kitchen laughing and joking with her kitchen staff while I stood there watching all of this happen.

Jenel O.,"Waipahu, HI",209,359,475,1.0,5/29/2010,"Chili's is never my first choice but since it was my husband's choice, I agreed to go since we don't go often anyway. With 2 young kids in tow, we got there just after 6 and were seated not long after that (maybe 6:15).  Got drinks in a reasonable amount of time but the server lady didn't show up again to take orders for at least 20 more minutes. Many more minutes passed before our chips and salsa arrived.  We ordered the extra ranch-salsa and that didn't even arrive until the first round of chips was eaten.  I tasted it and it just tastes like ranch dressing and salsa mixed together so I have no idea what took so long.  Plus, the chips itself took so long to arrive that there should be no reason the side order of ranch-salsa comes 10 minutes later. It was at least 10 more minutes by the time I received my cup of soup!  Meals FINALLY arrived... my salad (parts of it) was barely chopped up.  It just looked like someone took a hammer to some iceberg lettuce, gave it one thunk and threw the pieces on the plate (yes, one portion looked like an entire quarter of the head).  And at $12 for a sledgehammered salad... I think not! After getting us some boxes.... we just sat and WAITED for who knows how long to get the bill.  Not wanting to wait any longer, once we received it, I physically took the bill and credit card to the server so she couldn't escape us AGAIN for another 15+ minutes.   I'm pretty sure we waited far longer than we actually ate there.  Also, I would've ordered some dessert but no one offered and it got too late at that point anyway.  Which would've meant more tip for her if we ordered more. This experience truly sucked.  For anyone out there with young kids or maybe servers who are serving families with young kids... I would say that most families are trying to get out of there faster (than not) so quicker service is usually appreciated! 1 star for food be ""ok"" - negative 5 stars for the terrible service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=340

It's a decent place for a casual restaurant night-out. My family and friends usually go to CPK Ala Moana or Kahala, but we decided to try something different. Plus, we had gift cards. Our default go-to restaurant would still be CPK over Chili's. I'm about to be nit-picky though ... I do not like the digital menu-ordering devices. I'd much rather tell my waiter the order. We were experiencing glitches, and had to wait a long while to figure out what was actually ordered and correct the bill. I understand though that technical difficulties aren't common. If I have to use the eMenu, it should at least include everything on the menu. To be blunt, the eMenu seems like a slight easy way out for the waiters. My opinions about Chili's eMenu don't affect my star rating. The service was meh. The food was decent, but if you are on a diet, I don't recommend Chili's.

San M.,"Aiea, HI",0,8,2,1.0,12/12/2012,"This is tonight's back up place since the municipal lot in Kaimuki was packed. There were a lot of open tables when we got there, but we got placed at a two seat table.  Which means no fajitas for me. Sizzling plate+ plate with cheese, guacamole and sour cream+ rice and beans plate+ tortilla plate+ extra plate they give so you can build your fajita= craziness on the small table.  Not to mention 1/3 of the table was already covered with table condiments, menus and advertisements.  I placed some of these things on the divider rail.  Which actually was a plus because it blocked one of the blinding over head lamps from shining into my eyes.  They really need to dim the lights a little. Okay I understand when it is busy food takes a while to come out. It wasn't busy when we got there and it took more than 30 minutes from ordering before we got our food.  Our drinks were refilled quickly but just made us colder being that the place was empty so the room was on the colder side.  A basket for the rib bones was supposed to come but never showed up, oh well. I tried something different, Sweet & spicy chicken, it was on the low calories menu.  Honestly if I'm eating at Chili's I'm not there to eat healthy.  Sad thing is I used to like how they had butter on the broccoli.  I could do without the over saltiness of their food.  Tonight the salt level was okay.  Low calories just means a small portion, which they charge +$15 for... boggles my mind.   My chicken was burnt.  I basically ate my rice and broccoli.  I also took a piece of rib from K.K.'s plate. A manager paused at our table and asked if everything was okay.  I really dislike saying anything because it becomes a big deal even if I insisted that I am fine.  You asked so I answer 'my chicken is burnt but it's okay.'  Solution would be maybe you might tell your chefs not to burn the chicken anymore.  BUT instead of hearing that I am fine with the burnt chicken and K.K. will eat it,  and I'm just going to eat some of his food so I don't starve.  I get the oh want me to get you something else.  At which point I say we already waited 30 minutes for our food and we are on a time constraint.   They then tried to get me to take a complimentary dessert.  I cannot recall Chili's ever having a dessert worth trying.  Oh and I guess they don't recall I said we were running low on time since our food took 30 minutes. The check took a long time to process.  A tray came back to us with another tab and someone else's credit card which by the way was the wrong color, red instead of green.  It also had a female ID photo instead of a male photo.  I think we waited more than five minutes for the bill to be processed.  For a while there we thought they had lost the credit card and it was off in someone else's wallet.

I enjoy sitting on their lanai on nice evenings, which is much more comfortable than their refrigerated deep-freeze dining room. There's rarely a wait to be seated outside, another big plus. I've eaten here many times and usually get good food and service. Some of my faves are their fajitas, Monterey chicken, and Shiner Bock burger. They are not low-fat but they are juicy and pack plenty of flavor. On the down side, their prices are a bit high for what you get, but then I feel that way about most restaurants in Hawaii. Parking near the restaurant is usually hard to get, since the restaurant shares its lot with Kahala Mall and other popular eateries. I don't really mind, since I need the exercise after eating here anyway. And a tip for the ladies: their toilets leak, so be careful in there for yourself or your keiki.

Jon M.,"Honolulu, HI",154,95,8,3.0,9/26/2011,"Our experience was a typical Chili's experience. If you've ever eaten at this chain you can expect the same as any other location. If you haven't eaten there.... The food was solid. Burgers, steaks, chicken dishes, soups, salads, apps, that type of thing. I always get the queso dip because it's delicious and it didn't let me down. I usually get a burger but went for the sliders this time. Bit size burgers sounded appealing. They were mediocre though. A bit bland. They didn't have any sauce on them I don't think. So I threw a little ketchup on them and they were ok, but they could use some bbq or something to spice them up a bit. They're speciality drinks are their margaritas and they didn't let us down. They were tasty. We tried a few different ones and they were all good. They do have a full bar and few beers on tap too if that's more your thing. Service was a little slow, not unreasonably slow though. We sat at the bar and they were slammed. It might have seemed like a longer wait had I been sitting at a table waiting around for a server, but watching the two bartenders running around like crazy people helped to realize how busy they were this night. They really could have used one extra bartender just to take care of servers tickets but service was still friendly and as quick as possible. The ambiance is typical chain restaurant type. Couple TV's in the bar with ESPN on with lots of tables and booths and families around. The layout was identical to a few of the ones I'd eaten at in California so you pretty much know what you're getting into if you've ever been to a Chili's anywhere.

Gary M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,1,1.0,7/15/2013,"Wish I would have read the reviews before I set out across town to come here. First I called to ask about the birthday email club. It wouldn't let me print out the coupon for the free desert so I called in advance to make sure they would do the birthday thing and not mess it up. So I get to the restaurant and get seated. The server came over and did not seem to be in a good mood, just what I love when I go out to enjoy a meal.  I tried to joke with him about getting two appetizers since I had two coupons; he was in no mood for that so that set the bar for our evening. I also told him that it was my fiancées birthday and let him know about the call I made earlier to the manager about it. We ordered and waited for our appetizers. The server came over and apologized that it was taking so long to bring out the apps and that it would be out soon.  After about 20 min or so they finally came out and he apologized again for it taking so long.  They actually tasted pretty good, they were some type of chips and but having the server as dry as he was and it feeling like we were bothering him being there made the experience less than pleasant, especially since I drove from Liliha to go there for my fiancées birthday. Then after another 15 min or so the main entrees came out. This is where it started really sucking. I ordered the ribs and fries and started to eat. The fries were dry and semi-warm, not hot and fresh but dry and semi-warm. The ribs were a little tough and also semi-warm. It was apparent that they held the meal because the appetizer took too long and they didn't want them both out together.  My fiancée had the chipotle chicken strips and she had the same experience with it not being hot, same with the fries warm and dry. As we were still eating I asked the server for a to-go box. The box came out and so did the bill and they started cleaning up right away to get us out of there. I was waiting for the birthday song and nothing. How nice of them to forget why we drove all the way there, FOR HER BIRTHDAY! So I mention to another server what happened and still nothing for another 7-8 minutes so I had to ask, again, my server for the birthday perk. After another 10 minutes I finally hear them coming. After they did their stint they dispersed quickly and without even giving us a spoon for the desert. Had to wait and find the server again. All in all it was a very unpleasant experience, the only good part was that I was with the one that I loved on her birthday and because of that I was not going to be in a foul mood! Save yourselves the hassle and frustration and avoid this location at all costs, I know we and our friends will not be coming back here anytime soon! Thanks!

So we go along thinking, okay, well maybe they'll just sit us at a short table and we can have a high chair there.  Nope, they sit us at the high tables.  The waitress is a young girl, and comes and asks what we want to drink.  She sees our baby.  She does not ask if we want a high chair or anything (I was waiting to see if she would).  So our waitress comes back and I ask her if we can have a high chair.  She says no, because the table is too high and the high chair would be in the way.  I'm about to ask if we can move, when she suggests getting us a booster seat.  Our baby is not large by any means, and sure as heck doesn't look like he should be sitting in a booster seat yet.  He could also slide right out of a booster seat, which doesn't have any way to keep them seated in it. I'm just really disappointed because who sees a family with a baby in tow and doesn't automatically get them a high chair, or at least ask if they would like one?  My husband and I still can't believe that they sat us in the bar area, with no high chair, and only offered a booster seat when we asked for a high chair.  Am I supposed to eat my food while holding a baby on my lap? When we ate at the Chili's in Mililani, they sat us in the restaurant area and automatically got a high chair for us, so it's not that Chili's isn't a family-friendly restaurant. I am really, really disappointed with the Chili's Kahala Mall staff and DEFINITELY won't be eating there again.  Shame on you guys!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=380

Christine L.,"Auckland, New Zealand",183,439,351,2.0,9/4/2013,"Okay this review is for the food. Because when we visited here last night our server James was excellent. Totally not his fault that the kitchen at this location SUCKS. Anyone who knows me knows I'm a foodie, so Chilis is really just an option if nothing else is open. But Boyfriend loves their chicken crispers so we went to the Kahala location last night. First we were seated in the bar next to this very loud table of 5 extremely drunk people. They were super obnoxious so we asked to be moved. This is strike one for me because I feel especially at a family chain, they should know when to cut people off. Our server later told us that they had been there for two hours and had 14 shots each! Um overkill much? Anyways our server was this adorable young guy named James, and if it weren't for him we would honestly have walked out and not even paid. Now foodwise I should have known better than to order steak at Chilis but they had this deal for $12 and it came with a salad, 6oz steak, garlic bread, and sweet potato fries. Sold. Boyfriend got a salad and his chicken crispers. I specifically asked for no onions on my salad . Onions were present. Sigh. Also my salad were topped with cucumbers that had mold on them. Um...ew. My medium steak came out and it was almost blue rare. I could tell without even cutting it that it was raw inside. I asked for it to be medium and my server took it away with many apologies. Nice kid. It comes back...same piece of steak (I could tell from where I cut it) only now it is officially dead. I don't think I have ever had steak that was soooo well done. I choked on swallowing a piece. Now to be fair the manager did take it off the menu but I was pretty disgusted with the food at that point. And poor James looked like he knew he wasn't going to get tipped. But still acted like a champ! So friendly still and joked around with us. We ended up giving him a 30% tip cause we felt so bad, although his service really was excellent.  Overall worst food I have had in a long time. But go see James V! Great server!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=380
Sam O.,"Madison, SD",294,46,31,1.0,10/26/2010,"I used to work for a Chili's in California as a server and a trainer, and was appalled the first time I visited this Chili's.  Service was slow, order took a long time (without apology), food did not meet corporate standards, and the waitress -- who's shirt said ""trainer"" -- seemed oblivious to all of it. I've been back a few times since because I miss my old Chili's, and this one always disappoints.  The food never tastes right or is plated incorrectly.  The price is way too steep for what it is.  And one time, I had a ROACH crawl out of my CHIPS.  Yes it's a restaurant, and yes this is Hawaii, but there is NO EXCUSE for that. If you've had a good experience at a Chili's on the mainland, steer clear of Chili's Kahala, lest it permanently tarnish you view of the entire chain.  The whole point of going to a chain is that you expect it to be consistent from restaurant to restaurant.  Not the case here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=380
Mateo R.,"Honolulu, HI",73,6,13,1.0,2/9/2013,"I went to Chilis to celebrate my birthday with my friends. My girlfriend called in advanced to ask about a reservation, they don't take any so we just said we would arriving at around 7pm. We arrived 10 minutes late due to the bus and traffic. Upon our arrival  we were greeted by who seemed to be the manager on duty, we told her we called in advanced that we needed a table for 8 and she rudely comments, ""We gave your table away, we didn't think you were coming.""  So far not so good, so we wait 10 minutes to be seated.      We arrive to our table and our waiter comes over takes our drink order. Since it was in celebration of my 21st birthday I was curious about the drink menu, I asked what the price of each drink was and he would just give me the run around and avoid answering my question. He kept playing with his long hair and seemed unfocused.       I finally decided on what drink I wanted and we all ordered our food. We waited about 10 more minutes for appetizers to come out. We ordered the loaded potato skins, regular nachos, and sweet potato fries. The food was bland, the skins had a rubbery consistency and it lacked flavor. The nachos were terrible, they are individually prepared, they had: chili, cheese, and olives. We got a total of 8 individual chips. All you can taste is cheese and grease. This was definitely not worth the price. The Sweet potato fries were descent can't really complain about fires.      We all ordered a steak entree, It was pretty bad.  The steak was dry, not charred at all, and looked like plastic. Truly.  It looked like something that would come out of a Fisher-Price plastic kitchen set.  It was low on flavor, which may not be a surprise for places such as Chilis, but the standard was so low that even taco-bell steak looks and tastes better. It was very disappointing for $17.       The server and manager did redeem themselves a little bit, all of our entrees were supposed to come with broccoli. They both came and apologized that the last batch of broccoli was bad so they didn't serve it to us. All the orders but one made it out to our table. We were missing one whole steak combo plate. We told the waiter to cancel the order since it was never sent out to us.       Since this was in celebration for my birthday, the waiter came out with a bowl of ice cream for me. I had a lit candle; It was a nice gesture but the ice cream was already half melted, so it was more of an Ice cream soup.       Overall it was a terrible first time experience, I will not be going back to Chilis. They lost a customer for good.                                              How to get here from UH Manoa      If you're feeling lazy take the 13 bus that picks up in front of Frear Hall and get off on the corner near The Fat Greek. Then take the 1 or 1L bus heading to Kahala mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=380
Kendra O.,"Honolulu, HI",192,113,22,3.0,7/17/2011,"I used to frequent the Kahala Chili's practically every week, then stopped for a while, and recently started going there again.  One thing about Chili's is that the food is pretty consistent, which it should be since it's part of a chain.  I like the variety of food they have to offer, particularly if I'm with a group of friends who may all feel like eating different things - salad, ribs, burgers, they have something for just about everyone. I'm not a big fan of the Mexican sides (rice and beans), and my experience with their drinks has been pretty lackluster, especially for the price.  I am a big fan of the chicken enchilada soup and garlic bread (which I'm pretty sure is Pepperidge Farm Texas Toast).  It's not on the menu, but you can order a basket of 5 pieces of garlic bread as a side order. When I feel like eating healthy, I order the cobb salad.  When I'm feeling not-so-healthy, I go for a burger or a triple dipper which allows you to choose 3 appetizers.  Last time I went for the potato skins, southwestern egg rolls, and spinach & artichoke dip.  Once in a while I splurge on ribs or a steak - I really enjoy the ribeye. As for service, it's usually okay - not bad, but not exceptional either, although there have been one or two outstanding servers during my many visits there.  It's proven to be a good option when lines at the other Kahala Mall restaurants are long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=380

John Y.,"Honolulu, HI",29,84,376,3.0,4/13/2013,"why oh why don't I ever learn, going out to dinner on a Friday evening without pre-arranged reservations is as enjoyable has having your teeth yanked with a pair of rusty pliers by a Hobbit on roller skates blindfolded. 1830- Our Friday evening turned out to be a disaster as our first 2 preferences were heavily booked with long waiting times. 1900- Someone (soon to be an ex-friend) recommended Chili's which is located in Kahala Mall.  Anyone who has been to Kahala Mall on a Friday evening should well enough know that parking is as scarce as a blind man entered in a Finding Waldo contest.  After circling around the various parking areas within the Kahala Mall parking lot, we gave ourselves another 10 mins or we would just put ourselves out of our misery and just order take out from Pearl's Korean food. 1930- Our bad Karma must have been in overdrive as a parking spot miraculously opened and we were on our way to another unforeseen disaster. Just our luck, Chili's was jam packed, a 30 minute wait, take it or leave it, our hunger was clouding our judgement so we meekly succeeded go the hostesses evil plan. After being seated, we hurriedly placed our orders while the gods smiled upon us, little did we know, he was punking us.

We were promtly seated and our order was taken then the wait began.. yes it actually took 37 minutes to get our main order. The salad we did order came within 20 minutes though. The place was pretty much empty and we were just ready to get up and pay for our salad and leave when the nice waitress brings our food. (we should have kept going) WOW?? The look of dismay when viewing the food we ordered and what they brought to the table.. were like 2 different worlds. First of all my wife had a combo meal of chicken and shrimp. (choice of 2 sides and she ordered steamed rice and broccolli) The portion looked like it was for kiddies/keiki menu.. or closer to.. infant (small infant that is) size. Oh dear, no we are not slobs or need buckets of food to quench our appetite but.. ""WHAT is this??"" $25.00!! for a kiddie portion??? OH my. Then I had to look at my order.. (with side of Rice and fries) of 1/2 rack of BBQ ribs. Please tell me.. what happened to the ribs. Was the porky fella ano'rexic or just starved before slaughter?? Really.. I mean no harm... the ribs did taste good it's just there weren't much to consume. 5 skinny ribs with very little meat. Did I order the vegetarian rib special or what? Now come on.. I could buy a much larger portion of rack of ribs at Times and BBQ them myself then suffer this torture. I know the menu shows a nice juicy rack of ribs.... but what I see on my plate and what is on the menu are 2 totally different things. Really.. not exagerating here. We came here with an open mind and healthy appetite. we left.. feeling cheated and hungry. Come on... where do you spend $50.00+ for lunch and leave hungry? I am tempted to stop by Times and pick up a rack of ribs and smoke and BBQ them myself and take it back to Chilli's and educate them to what a 1/2 rack of ribs actually looks like. So a lesson learned. We will not go to Chili's again. Not sure of the other Chili's but the Kahala one is for sure not the place to go when you are HUNGRY and want to leave full. For those whom speak highly of this place... Hmm that leaves a lot to ponder. Or is it just on slow Mondays they serve mini portions?  A lesson learned.

The food was better and the servise although slow was better.  The food was OK not good, but OK. I rarely eat Mexican food unless you consider Taco Bell LOL Mexican. But the food was good for the price you pay. Chili's is what you would call a quick serve restaurant/bar much like Ruby Tuesdays. And for a quick serve restaurant Chili's does a good job. The service was OK although it took a while for our food and it wasn't even busy. But the server made up for it by explaining it was the cooks fault for trying to over cook our steaks. She told us she tried to tell him to not over cook the steaks. She even waited for us to cut our steaks to make sure it was medium rare. She went far beyond what I expected.  Being a cook I get up set when my steaks are not cooked the way I like it LOL. But she did a good job to try and make us Happy.

I wasn't really in the mood for it but, I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  The party had already started but, the waitress was very much aware of my arrival. he asked me if I would like something to drink and even pointed out the perfect margarita for me to drown my Monday blues. It's Chili's fairly new margarita named ""The World's Freshest Margarita"". Now, I am a bit of a cocktailnista (meaning, I like a good well balanced - mixed drink and know when I taste one). Milagro® Silver Tequila (100% Blue Agave), Milagro Agave nectar and fresh-squeezed lime juice on the rocks - they can't possibly mess this one up...and they didn't. It was uber delicious. They could have shaved a few ice cubes off the top but, it was really yummy and punched the perfect kick.  For dinner I ordered the Chicken Fajitas. It's always exciting to have one of those sizzling platters delivered to you. Served on an obnoxious mound of grilled onions and a few slivers of green bell pepper, the chicken remained moist and delicious. Though the tortillas are rather small I still managed to get a good amount of filling packed in there. The manager must have known that they're a little challenged cause she stopped by and asked me if I needed more of them. I didn't want to share with her that the only way I would need more was if I was a fan of onion stuffed fajitas (cause that was all that was left after crafting an ingesting my three).

Peter C.,"Honolulu, HI",455,34,15,3.0,12/18/2014,"I went here the other night, it was nothing more then I expected.  You know what you're getting when you walk into a Chili's and I'm okay with that.   I wouldl like to review the Ziosk system though.  Chili's has these new computers at every table that allow you to re-order your drinks and possibly food.  I take issue with a couple of things regarding these devices.   First, Ziosk uses what appears to be a propietary android OS.  Its a little buggy, and glitchy from time to time, its not smooth like other operating systems.  It displays the specials, which is pretty neat and could potentially take a lot of work away from the server.  I'd like to think of myself as a decent tipper (20% at least), but in the future, if a computer is giving me more service then a server, then I suppose I would question my 20% tip.  I may give less, I'm not sure on that.   Now I assume that the big idea behind the Ziosk, is that big-picture-wise, servers will get more tables in their section, get tipped less, but more than likely it will even out.  If Chilis hires less servers, then more money from their labor costs goes towards the stores bottom line.  -again I'm fine with this... its Chili's not Vintage Cave. That being said, there were a few things that bothered me.  The Ziosk along with the table caddies take up WAY too much table real estate.  If your going keep the Ziosks, get rid of those table caddies.  No need for me to read out dated material on a table flyer when I could look at the Ziosk.   If a food est. is going to go tech, then go tech... don't half ass it.  It should be up to consumer on whether or not I want to use the tech... or even see it for that matter.  It was distracting me from my company.  I would rather Chilis just make an app similar to CPK's take out app.  They could have QR codes or something else for a phone to scan to get the point of sale system the info in needs from your phone.  Lastly, I would like to say the our food was what I expected it to be.  Our server, a nice filipino girl with glasses... she did her job, we got our food in a timely manner, and our drinks were never empty.   Overall it was it was an ""a-ok"" experience.  I'll probably be back but, I'll remove the Ziosk from the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=240

Instead of having the waitress put the bill in front of you, you can actually use it to pay your bill and get refills on certain things like drinks and food too, which I have never seen before.   Also the good news is that they now participate in the iD card (Isle Discount).  I need to find out how it works so that way I do know what I can use it for and make sure that I get to save $$$ as well as try their food too.  I was glad that my friend ordered the chocolate moten cake, which was very decadent and very chocolaty and deliciousness. ..I thank my friend for sharing this dessert with us so that I get to see how it tastes and let me tell you,  it was very good and tasty as well.   Thanks for the hostess for making sure that we were well taken care of and enjoyed this night for me and my buddies too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=240

Kuli O.,"Honolulu, HI",7,28,,1.0,8/25/2014,"Read my review, or read this first sentence and analogy: Chili's is the culinary equivalent of going to a refrozen sale at Safeway, and serving the twice refrozen goods at restaurant by heating them with a microwave or deep frier, however by marking up the food to prices higher than any reasonable competitors!   This may seem like a strong review but let me just cover some fundamental problems with this restaurant.       Firstly, although the waiters are quick to get your order in, they seem sloppy and immature without real training. I want to be treated by adults as an adult, I am not friends with the waitstaff. They need a serious manager.             Secondly, All of Chili's food is overpriced: everything is $13. For $13 I can go to Cafe Laufer and support a local business with excellent service and great clean food!  The cake is cheaper at Laufer, and ten times better than the boxed defrosted dessert at Chili's.    Thirdly, Chili's food is made on the mainland, and reheated here! There is no chef at this godforsaken place. Why don't people seem to know that?  When you order soup at Chili's it comes out of a big can!      Fourthly. the food is inauthentic. The Mexican dishes are tasteless and made by people who don't care about plate presentation or quality.  Everything was shocking: a tiny barely identifiable slice of avocado on my chicken sandwich, microwaved vegetables!!!!!  Finally, it hurt me to see a kind local family eating at Chili's spending their hard earned money at this dump when for the same price they could have gone to the Chinese across the street, CPK, or even kuru kuru.  IF you like Chili's slime burgers, phony chicken fried steak ( comes our of a freezer), you need to really stop eating campbell's soup, ramen from a package, and spam. Honolulu has great local restaurants and the last thing we need is another overpriced MCD's substitute! Why do we let such an UN-wholesome restaurant exist in beautiful Hawaii?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=240

The food is petty good.  The service is as average as you can get, but with a smile on your face.  The thing about Chili's is that it's kind of overpriced for what you do get.   I waited for 20 minutes for my entree to come and my drinks took 10 minutes after ordering.  It was Saturday afternoon, but come on!! The place was more or less a ghost town and I was sitting at the bar.  Apparently, someone was on break and someone else had to cover for them. The sides were pretty good, although not stellar as it once was.  I'm a fan of the loaded mash potatoes though.  Today, I had the baby back rib combination platter. It was good and tender.  The only gripe I had was the chocolate molten cake.  In years past, it was ginormous and costed $5.25, which fed 2-3 people.  Now its $6.99 and smaller. What a crock!! I guess its how they need to make money and cut down on waste. Maybe. it's still pretty good and tastey though Not coming back any time soon though.

The big mouth bites were more towards medium well rather than medium rare but I'm not complaining it still tasted just fine, however, our server never once asked if we needed anything else or how the food was. Water wasn't promptly refilled, in fact after about 10 minutes of my water being empty someone took it off the table, not sure if it was Amber or someone else, but they never returned it. I had to ask for a new cup of water later on.  Overall, service wasn't the best as our server was mostly absent but the food was good. As an employee of the Cheesecake Factory, I do see the difference in service standards between restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=280

Darcy K.,"Pearl City, HI",83,148,200,2.0,1/28/2012,"Aiyah what happened!? I ate lunch with a friend today and we were both really disappointed. The waitress failed...hardcore!! Supposedly wanted to recommend something but did not... BS ALERT!   I was really unhappy with my ""trio sampler appetizer"" dish. Ordered sliders (meh, they were nothing special. Found it strange that the patties were connected to each other and the elements of it were generic), fried cheese (not cooked enough), and chicken crispers (beer-battered, not a good combo for chicken). Apparently there is another method that they cook the crispers, called ""Country style"", and the waitress described it as ""Basically like KFC-style."" NO GOOD ALREADY! For dessert, I ordered the molten chocolate cake. got to the middle and the chocolate was not even completely melted.  Not too bad, but could have been better.  That hot fudge is so good with the vanilla ice cream! Food took longer than average. Also I find it disappointing that there is no happy hour specials, yet they have a full bar and many specialty drinks (especially margaritas). Poo.   Bad service.... with a smile. GOOD POINTS: Their Classic Bacon Burger is really good!  Instead of getting Chicken Crispers, I recommend their wings (bone or boneless, no matta).  The sauce is spicy (7 on a scale of 1-10)!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=280

For some reason I feel like all Chili's restaurants are different...this one in Kahala is not impressive -- every time I go the service sucks. Slow servers, rude servers, no server serving you, etc. The Chili's where my parents live is awesome, though, so go figure.  If you haven't had them before, get the chicken and steak fajita plate.

The last time I dined at this location was with step-mom and little half-sister.  My sister is pretty darn fickle when it comes to eating.  She only likes certain foods, and they've got to be unhealthy.  Luckily, Chili's has cheese fries with bacon bits... And on the kid's menu there's macaroni and cheese.  Yay.   She had both.  Us ""grown ups"" ordered a crap-ton of food.   I ordered the cup of chicken enchilada soup, shared the triple dipper appetizer, and ordered the chicken crispers and the half rack of the baby back ribs; and my step-mom ordered the mini-burgers.  Needless to say, our table was incredibly overcrowded.  In order to fit everything on our table, we had to stack and consolidate - it was a complete mess.  And due to the side dishes that came with the entrees, we had a ridiculous amount of starch.  Waaaay more than enough. In other words, portions are generous; starch portions are extremely generous.   The overall experience was okay.   The food was tasty and sinful as always...  Service, on the other hand, was not so good.  They were slightly busy and messed up on an order, then forgot several things we had asked for...  The water refilling was a little slow too.  Hmm... Understaffed??   We were in no rush, but felt slightly forgotten. :( We will be back, but hopefully when they are fully staffed or not as busy.

One thing to note is that most meals are big enough for 2; my boyfriend and I typically split an appetizer and a meal and are full. If you're traveling from the mainland it is also important to know that there are NOT 2 for 1 drinks and there are not free chips and salsa at the bar. That was hard for me to wrap my head around but using social media can get you freebees so take advantage of that.

Half rack of ribs were tender, and good.  The 10 oz sirloin was ordered medium, but came out well done and dry as hell. We let the manager know, and she was nice enough to give us a generous discount without us asking. (the half rack was the combo special $20-25?)

She seats us at a booth and the table is still dirty. We ask the waitress to please have it cleaned.  She looks at it, nods and walks away. 10 minutes later we had to ask her again. We placed our order pretty much right when we sat down...mind you I was starving.  Our food took 30 minutes, and everyone else was either getting their food or was already done. We ordered steak (medium rare) & salmon and a pepperoni pizza. the plate was hot...meaning it was under the heat lamp for a while.  The salmon was over cooked and the steak was RAW.

It was noisy enough that no one seemed to notice or care that our two kid were yapping up a storm and this fact made it easier for me to relax and just enjoy our dinner. Our waiter was overly busy (seemed like there was just two waiters for the whole place) but always friendly. We did have to wait quite a while, maybe 15 minutes, for our food. But we got a sampler appetizer platter with spring rolls and potato skins which made us happy and the fresh, crispy chips that came with salsa were really good.We ate the whole basket of chips! The bf ordered these wicked deep fried boneless chicken strips with tons of spicy honey chipotle sauce on it which was GOOD. I got the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger which had two really thick slices of maple bacon that were so yummy I ate one slice by itself.

The food isn't that good either, I prefer the Pearl a Ridge location any day. But there is one particular occasion that just made me never want to go there again. We went out for dinner for my father in laws birthday on Saturday, we were seated outside by these torches. My 3 year old son had just woken up so he was fussy and was freaking out, the manager knew but didn't offer us a spot inside.. Then we waited 20 minutes for the water to come, then another 20 minutes for him to take our order. We were going to get appetizers but we didn't because he took so long to come check on us so we just ordered our food. Then he messed up our orders, then we were dumb enough to order dessert. We waited a while more for that. Now this part, takes the cake.. Everyone paid their bills in cash except me. The waiter charged my card all three of our family's bills! My bill alone was $115 (with tip) then he charged another $80 & $70! Luckily I seen it on my bank account! I went in the next day and they were brushing it off like it was no big deal. The manager refunded me one bill but not the other. It's Tuesday now & still nothing in my bank. He said wait another day then goes ""I'll help you out like I did the other bill"" like he's doing ME a favor! I'm beyond disgusted with this location. I never am going back again! I bet that waiter pocketed the money.. He had no remorse the next day when we seen us, all he said was ""I must've charged the wrong card"" (keep in mind, they all paid in cash so there's no other cards he could've gotten it mixed up with) then he just walked away.

Teresa L.,"Honolulu, HI",120,215,240,2.0,8/11/2011,"I came here on a monday night around 630 PM. It wasn't crowded so we were seated immediately.  For appetizer we had their special tripple decker where we selected 3 from a list. I had the spinach artichoke dip, southwestern eggrolls, and boneless buffalo wings. The spinach artichoke dip was delicious despite the few large chucks of artichoke. It came with chips that were very thin and complimented the dip very well. The dip was not so heavy because it was topped with cheese and tomatoes. The southwestern eggrolls were also very delicious. I'm not a big fan of beans but I loved the beans in the egg rolls. The only appetizer I would do without is the boneless buffalo wings. They were too salty and tasted like something I could buy premade at costco and heat in the oven myself.  For dinner I had the rib eye which was 12 oz. I ordered it medium rare but half came medium rare and the other half came medium well. The sides that I chose were broccoli and cole slaw. Their cole slaw was okay but the broccoli was too soft and watery. I guess I'm used to slightly cooked broccoli that is sauteed rather than boiled.  My parents shared the same dish as I, but instead they got the loaded mashed potatoes and french fries as their sides. The loaded mashed potatoes is similar to a baked potato but without the potato skin. Their french fries were also okay. Not great, but not bad. The worst thing about this experience was the service. I took a while for the server to give us some boxes for our food and our check. I would come back again for the food, but I would be prepared to experience long waits for a table or for service. ** Happy hour is from 4-6 and it's something like $2 off appetizers and $2 off 23 oz draft beer **Order online To Go at ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=220

Our server let my boyfriend and I have a few minutes to review the menu and said he'd be back in a couple to take our order. I think he forgot about us. Strike 1. By the time he came back to take our order, my boyfriend's parents were receiving their food. I had checked into yelp (*duh*) and found that there was an offer for free chips and queso! Who doesn't like a  deal?! So of course we took the deal. Our food eventually came though our server totally walked past our table, forgetting who the food was for. At that point, we were like ""maybe he has a bunch of tables tonight..."" and tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. He also was not attentive to us and only cleared our dishes when we asked him to. Strike 2. The food wasn't terrible, but the reason this review is getting one star is because of what happened when we got the bill. My boyfriend has a mall discount so for Tuesday, it should have been 20% (or 25%?). When we tried to apply the discount, our server said that we couldn't apply two discounts (the yelp deal and the 20% discount) on the same bill. We didn't understand but we asked to pay for the queso and apply the 20% discount to the bill. FIRST our server tried to convince us that the discount for the queso was going to be the better deal than the 20% off. Um, let's do the math... NOPE, it was not the better deal. SECOND, he said that since he keyed in the queso discount, he could not override it to use the 20% discount instead. SAY WHAT? THEN the manager comes out and tells us that he is unable to override the computer and he cannot void the whole transaction so that they could start over. I call BS. Because we didn't want to make a scene in front of his parents, we didn't continue our fight (though the server and the manager were being ridiculous). So, whatever, we just paid the bill (their tip was us paying the part we would have been discounted). Strikes 3, 4, & 5 (yes, I know there are only 3 strikes in baseball, but that's how crap-tastic they were.)

Emmanuel D.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,5.0,5/2/2016,"I came in on a Sunday night with a group of 6, was pretty busy. I waited a while, but once we got sat everything got better. Our server, looked very young, but super professional and made our day. Al I think his name was Christian. He was so patient with our children and answered all of our questions not too mention thanks for talking us into that berry thingy. It was so good..  The food came out fast, drinks were always full, and anything we needed he answered with a smile. I'm just surprised by this bc i usually receive poor service bc of my age(being only 21). Yet, our service was amazing not to mention our food came out perfect (surprisingly). Usually there always something wrong when my family goes out. So thank you Chili's for the awesome family night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=220

The service is generally good but that depends on your server, and the food is delicious. The portions are a good size and the prices are reasonable.

One thing I will add is that after ordering our food, I checked in on Yelp and saw they offer a free queso and chips appetizer with check in.  The queso wasn't so good but the chips are good, crispy and really thin so they seem extra crunchy.  I think of all things I've had here, the chips are definitely the best.  It's too bad they no longer offer a complimentary basket of them. :( Oh, and also if you check in and get the free queso/chips, remember to double check your bill because they charged us for it and we didn't realize it 'til we had left...and...after I realized it, I remembered the last time I was at Kapolei they did the exact same thing, so DOUBLE CHECK your bill before leaving!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=120

Always remember to check in at Chili's, so you can get your free chips and queso. Margaritas are always fun, and they are served in the shaker, so you get more than one drink. I went with a healthy choice, which had sirloin, salad, and cherry tomatoes. I think it's a seasonal dish, but it was really yummy.

Usually when my husband and I order the margarita flat bread it's overcooked and doesn't look appealing, this one not only looked great but it tasted better than it looked. It wasn't overcooked, it was crispy in the right places and flavorful!! I got the spicy chile chicken and WOW WOW WOW. The chicken breast was huge, it was juicy and had so much flavor with every bite. The broccoli was done just right and seasoned well, the wheatberry and quinoa blend was tasty and perfectly cooked, not dry at all like the other 2 locations.

I ordered a mix plate of chicken tostada, beef enchilada, and chicken tacos. It came with beans and rice. Not too much to say about the food in general. It was satisfying and the portions were big enough for me to take home as leftovers. There are a lot of other menu items that I would like to try next time. I was satisfied with the service.

Anonymou S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,5.0,12/13/2013,"This is one of my favorite restaurants and I can tell you the good, the bad and the ugly. This review has 5 stars because I can, and I feel like it.  So many people are bashing this place like it's horrible, but it's really not.  Maybe my standards are lower, or maybe I just understand that this isn't just a restaurant... It's more of a sports bar, with a dining room area. Or maybe it's because every time I go there, I get bomb ass service from mostly the same servers... But I don't go frequently cause I'm not rich enough to buy really good expensive food all the time, but I usually get the same servers.  And every time, I get awesome ones.  I don't know all their names... but there's this really tall guy, he towers over everyone, he is very nice. This nerdy guy is on it with his servicing. This really nice lady Jessica, she always wears pretty makeup and has nice dark brown/black hair. This one server Nicole, has a super nice smile and makes you feel welcome! There's so much more, but I can't remember everyone. Also, the Hostesses are always nice and greet whoever walks in.  And sometimes, if it's slow, they'll even open the door for you when you arrive AND depart! Now for the food. I know what to buy, but I don't know what not to buy... I'll list everything that is AMAZING in no specific order. Big mouth bites Egg rolls Chicken crispers Caujin pasta Flat bread pizza Nachos (only if you have that green thing to dip it in!) Mac n' Cheese (because everyone has a kid food they love!) Steak and cheese sandwich (this fills you up if you eat a lot and it comes with fries) Spinach and artichoke dip with chips (when eating this, use your fork to pick up the dip, and put it on your chip. Chilis chips are thin, but better for you if you're going to have a full meal!) Ribs (They're good by itself, but taste amazing with ranch sauce, trust me.) Everything off the low calorie menu is good for you and that's probably why it doesn't taste as good as everything else, but hey, why go to a sports bar & grill if you're not gonna pig out like a sports fan? Salad is salad.  It tastes the same everywhere. Their desert though. ;D Oh my Oh My!!!!!! The MOLTEN CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE IS BY FAR the best desert I've ever had at a 2.5 star restaurant.  Seriously guys.  2.5 stars? WTF?  Just for this lava cake I'd give it 5 stars! I honestly think all you low stars should go back to chilis on a slow day, request a server by name and get at least one of the food choices I've said were amazing.  Just look in the good reviews, pick a name, and request that person to serve you.  Any time during the day is slower than normal.  Never go on a Friday night.  Fridays are crazy. And to all of those ""first time and last time I'll ever eat here,"" You're all dumb.  Just cause something was shitty once, you're just gonna say it sucks shit and you'll never go back.  Um excuse me? You ate there once and you judge it by that one time? I ate at this one restaurant in waikiki, the service sucked and the food was just pricey and I was still hungry, but that didn't stop me from going again because all restaurants are pricey, and people work so hard in waikiki, I wouldn't blame them for being cranky or forgetful. I know what it's like to work in the restaurant business.  If you've never worked at one, I understand why you would give it low stars.  You don't know what it's like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=420

I just tried their 10 things for under $7.  Which, for the bad economic times, are great for a restaurant to have.   After reading what they have I notice that everything is in a half portion (which is fine by me b/c I couldn't finish the full portion before).  So they had things like their quesadillas, nachos, hambuger, sliders (chicken or beef), etc.  All came with one choice of a side.  So I got the quesadilla (jalapeno steak flavor with a side of rice and beans.  You have to add $1.99 for that, BUT I got my one side on top of that... which was a loaded mash potatoes) and the bf got 2 chicken tacos and corn on the cob (I gave him my mash potatoes). The flavors are always spot on at Chilis.  I know it's not authentic, so when I say  ""flavors are spot on"" I don't mean the flavors are reminiscent of that time in Cabo.. lol.  I just mean it tasted good.  I could only eat 3 quesadillas (comes with 4) and I was pushing myself beyond stuffed (but I have my days when I can't eat that much)... and I've had their chicken tacos before and its awesome.  But, this place gets 4 stars for the value for our buck with good flavor, especially for a restaurant during these hard economic times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=420
Crystal B.,"Hawi, HI",27,119,,3.0,12/3/2011,"A Chili's is a Chili's is a Chili's, in my mind. I am reviewing it for what it is- a chain casual concept restaurant that I always consider myself slightly unlucky to end up in. I try to avoid chains at all costs, but it seems like sometimes when we're in kahala the options for casual sit down are cpk or Chili's, so I have now eaten here 3 times.  The first time was mostly for drinks and appetizers. The drinks were ok, but all from mixes (mojito mix, maybe even margarita mix) which I just hate. After the first mixed drink I just switched to beer, which I think was a good choice. We ordered the nachos, and imagine our surprise when out came a small plate with about 10 chips placed prettily in a circle. When I order nachos (and pay normal to high price for them) I want a big pile of chips, melty cheese, and gooey toppings. this dish just seemed to scream identity crisis. I expect that kind of thing at a fine dining restaurant, but not a Chili's. Plus, there weren't even good toppings or enough cheese. Boo. The other times I've gone I got the Buffalo Chicken salad, without the pico de gallo or bacon, which just seems like overkill to me. I also substitute blue cheese dressing because I have a personal vendetta against ranch. The servers have been accommodating of my strange requests, and the food has always come out the way I asked for it, which is more than I expect when I mess with the menu descriptions so much.  My complaints food-wise are just that it is overpriced for what it is. A fifteen dollar salad at a casual chain pains me a little. It isn't the end of the world, but it defintely keeps me from going more often. If I'm going to spend that much, I'd rather go to a ""real"" restaurant. 3 stars because it's fine for what it is.

Gidget T.,"Honolulu, HI",179,96,194,4.0,2/28/2009,"My favorite thing about this Chili's location is the ""Hawaiian Local Plate"".  You choose one meat dish and it comes with a side of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice.  It's delicious.  If not for that, I don't think I would be such a fan. Other than that, I don't find it any different from the other Chili's restaurants on the mainland.  They have a very small indoor waiting area, so on most weekends you'll have to wait outside.  They do have a considerable amount of outdoor seating that faces the mall (by the Counter).  Normally we don't have to wait more than 30 minutes to be seated.   Inside there is a bar area to the left and restaurant seating to the right.  The bar has TVs, tables for larger groups and booths.  I find most of their specialty drinks over very fruity and super sweet, which might not be your cup of tea.  One night they were giving out free Sweet Shots (their signature dessert) and every flavor we tried was awful.  I would not recommend it. The service is usually friendly, and we've never had a problem.  It is unusually cold inside, though.  I've heard many people complain, but there doesn't seem to be anything they can do about it.  I normally bring a jacket or sweater if I plan to eat there.  They have carry-out, but I ordered once before and found I only got one scoop of rice with my meal (totally unacceptable by any ""local plate"" standards).  It's a great place to eat if you like traditional American restaurants, they ca accommodate large groups easily, and I really enjoy that they have a dish that appeals to local clientele.  I'm a regular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=420

I've had five well done burgers here.   I don't know why the hell they even bother asking the customer what temp they want the burger since they're gonna zap the hell out of it anyway.

And when you're in the Kaimuki/Kahala area there are not many casual choices after 10pm. This review reflects the past two times we've been there. Tonight was the second time in the last three weeks We ordered the ribs, buffalo chicken sandwich, triple dipper with boneless buffalo chicken/chicken crispers/and spinach artichoke dip, house salad, and a cup of chili.  The ribs were nicely cooked with the meat falling off the bone, but I would've liked more sauce with it.  The chicken crispers were surprisingly good. Nice batter on the outside and juicy meat.  Buffalo wings and sandwich were good. Yes, you might say buffalo sauce is buffalo sauce, but I've had bad buffalo wings before.  I love buffalo sauce in general and theirs was up to par. The other thing that surprised me was the cup of chili. I'm used to Zippy's chili. This chili had a different spice to it AND there were no beans! Obviously I'm not a fan of beans. Like i said earlier you get what you get at chain restaurants. The food isn't why we rated it four stars. The thing that made our dining experience memorable and enjoyable was our server, Joseph, who waited on us both times. On the two occasions we went in near closing time and was his last table both times.  Working in the restaurant industry for 15 years we expected some negligence. Contradicting our expectations he treated us like we were his first table with enthusiasm and attentiveness going above and beyond what most servers in his position would do.  When were ordered he suggested meal combos to save money.  Even though they were doing their closing duties he was still attentive in re-filling drinks and kept checking if we were OK.  And in all honesty we both consumed the beverages quickly and he perfectly timed our re-fills (one of us had three re-fills of lemonade).  There was not one thing that we had to wait for or flag someone else down to get including our check but at the same time never felt rushed for more than once he assured us to take our time. All in all it was the service that will make us return again. When we go back we will be requesting him. ----""There is no love sincerer than the love of food""----",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=420
Michelle L.,"Honolulu, HI",857,554,237,3.0,1/7/2009,"mediocre food for a pretty hefty price tag.  started out with the spinach artichoke dip.  that was pretty good, tastes like the one at CPK.  i wish for the price they give more dip.  it came out in a little skillet and a huge basket of chips...makes no sense.  i ordered the guiltless salmon dish.  $17.99 for five pieces of broccoli, a bowl of beans, and a salmon fillet.  it was ok.  the only thing i la la LOVE is the molten chocolate cake.  that was the highlight  of my meal.  YUM. our server was super cool.  definitely made the experience better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=420

The other serves around everytime we tried to get their attention ignored us.. She ignored us & took care of everyone else around us giving them refills making sure there dinner time was comfortable but not once did she CHECK ON US the manager came out to apologize & comp a dessert for us but as we waited for our dessert we FINALLY got a refill of our drinks & again we had to wait 30 mins for our dessert.. As we waited for it our server came out with thee lamest excuse EVER! She said ""oh I was looking and looking I couldn't find it I think it's in a to go box?""

Dennis M.,"Honolulu, HI",13,271,14,3.0,6/8/2013,First with a warm and attentive welcome received and friendly professional answering to find me a single table. Apologized for not immediately getting a seat as the restaurant was almost full. Also hostess took to seat and ask for drinks. Water request came within 30 seconds. Excellent  start. But order taker did not come. After 10 minutes I flagged one down and she apologies as she thought order already taken by another person. Order taken just one simple flatbread but after 20 minutes I think the kitchen also has some problems getting the food. My waiteess did a good job by trying to apologies for her earlier mistake of order delay but she also knew they had some kitchen problems as most food was not coming out as seen by other tables. She stopped by several times and apologies and also offered another ready made similar dish if I could not wait. Finally after 30 minutes it came. Asst or mgr came by to apologies again for the ling delay. I informed her I was understanding as I know the business and informed her the waitress handled it well. In the end she gave me a complimentary lunch which was not necessary or expected. I thanked her and informed her the tip is still for the waitress. Hope they have better days.

I admit it, the crispers are the best thing on the menu but I hate to ask if the juicyness of the chicken breast is from the oil or not.  We'd come here all the time just for the crispers and give a 4 or 5 star rating but we'd also be 50 lbs heavier; hence we only come here when we have gift cards to use up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=420

Katie K.,"Honolulu, HI",46,73,15,4.0,4/22/2010,"Chili's is on of my favorite spots for a fun time with friends; its typically the place for margaritas on an almost weekly basis! The service: with a few exceptions- usually found in the bar area- is generally slow, and can lack personality and/or attentiveness. However, the chips and salsa and guacamole are amazing! The fajitas are bomb! The food keeps me coming back for more. Now let's talk drinks- many margaritas lack the amount of alcohol I desire, so fore go the classics and go for their newest: world's freshest margarita. You can taste the alcohol and its delicious, really can't go wrong!

Maile T.,"Honolulu, HI",0,9,9,1.0,10/24/2014,"My friend and I came to Chilis today to watch Thursday Night Football and get some drinks/Pupus.  We sat at the bar around 2:15 and was approached by a woman who said we could order drinks through her but that she was not the bartender.  I had a house Margarita and my friend ordered a beer.  The Margarita she brought over tasted like pure sweet n sour, but I tried to give it a chance.  As she was talking to us we saw a blonde girl walking around the bar who happened to be the bartender.  We wanted to order some Pupus but the bartender never came up to us.  A couple had sat down at this point who she tended too immediately.  As she was walking away from them, I said when you get a chance can we order some food.  She looked at me as if I was bothering her and she said K.  She then was in the well making drinks and had her back turned to us, looked over her shoulder and said I can take your food order while I'm doing this.  We ordered our food and she proceeded to tell us how we could save a little money by ordering the Pupus a certain way, which I thought.... now she is warming up and being nice.  After that I asked her name and she said her name was Kelly.  Another couple sat down beside us and she seemed to know them as she did the other couple.  She was very attentive to them and the other couple the entire time, but not to us at all.  We watched her walk around to tables with an angry look on her face as if she didn't want to be there.  The manager brought out our food.  So naturally we thought Kelly would come over and ask how it was....of course she did not. The first couple who sat down... she asked how their food was and engaged in a conversation with them as well as the second couple.  She passed by us several times but did not even look or talk to us.  Finally we were so fed up with the lack of any kind of decent service and asked the manager for our bill.  She brought it to us and I put out money to pay it.  After awhile Kelly took the payment, mumbled to herself I got to get them change.  She brought our change and barely looked at us and said Thank You.  I am a bartender who tips anywhere from 30 percent to 100 percent depending on the service I get.  I couldn't even leave Kelly a 10 percent tip.  She does not belong in the service industry.  She only tends to regulars which is fine, but had she given us good service we could have been new regulars for her.  Maybe a desk job would be more appropriate for Kelly.  Well Chilis, I suggest you train your staff to actually be nice to their guests and hire people who want to be there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=440

Rei J.,"Honolulu, HI",0,14,1,1.0,5/16/2013,Usually we have great service here but tonight was horrible.  We waited 30 minutes for cold food so the manager came out to replace it.  Our waitress was so weird too.  She wouldn't refill the beer fast but gave us double waters and plates.  She didn't come around a lot and wasn't friendly.  Not coming here for a while.  I was hoping for a great night out since I'm pregnant and don't have much nights out till I give birth.  So disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=440
Jaz C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,11,,2.0,5/14/2011,"I am a huge Chili's fan, but this Chili's in Kahala just doesn't cut it.  I have been to this Chili's about five times and have had the same lacking service 3 out of 5 times I have went.   One time in particular, we sat at a table with our menus and went unnoticed by a server for 40 minutes!  The tables ALL around us were being helped and yet we went unnoticed.  There were servers going back and forth all around us and not one even stopped to asked if we had been helped.  I work in a restaurant and there is no excuse for a server to see a table that has been sat for 40 mins and notice they don't even have drinks, and not say anything.  Finally, after waiting forever we chimed in and asked to be served. I honestly wanted to leave, but my boyfriend was hungry so we stayed and ate.  Once we did get  server, service was slow but okay.  It seems like every time we go here there is always some snag in the service.  I love Chili's and have had positive experiences with them all over the world, but this one is the exception!  I know not all servers are bad and slow, but the times I went there, that is the service I got. :( And to top it all off it is extremely expensive!

Colin Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,14,,1.0,12/9/2013,"Stay away from this place!!!  Horrible experience on Friday night, 12/7/13.  Ate here after my daughter's dance recital at Kahala Mall thinking it would be a fun quick dinner.  Six people in our party.  Place was packed and we sat outside.  We waited ONE HOUR for our food.  This included 2 kids meals and the adults had burgers and salads.  One hour for burgers and salads???  (on a sidenote, my mother in law originally ordered ribs but was told they were out of ribs.  That's right, a place known for ribs is completely out) Waitress kept coming around filling our water glasses and asking if we needed anything.  We shouted ""Yes, our food!""  Waitress seemed genuinely apologetic but it doesn't mean much when you have two starving kids that are on the verge of a meltdown.  I am curious how they prioritize tables because people who arrived AFTER us were finished with their meals before OUR food even came!  To add insult to injury, when our food came one hour later, they forgot my son's kid's meal.  Had to talk to another waitress and the manager to get his food.  Unbelievable.  When all was said and done, the manager came over and said she wouldn't charge us for the kids meals. WOW.  After all that, you would think they would comp us for the entire meal.  In any case, it didn't matter that the kids meals were free because by the time the food came, they just wanted to go home and sleep.  The next day, my son asked me why the restaurant gave everyone else their food but didn't want to give him his food.  Great job Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=440
Minda G.,"Waipahu, HI",2,12,,3.0,9/25/2012,"I hadn't been to Chili's in awhile (at least a good 6 months or so), until recently... It must have been the recent blue moon or something, because within the last 4 days I had gone to three different Chili's. The first one was Kahala, for lunch, with co-workers, the next was Mililani the very next night for dinner with family and the third time was at Waikele a couple days later for a senior dinner again with family. (senior dinner meaning around 4-ish). I usually like Kahala's location, bring seated right away with our party of 8. Our waitress was extemely friendly and accomodating.  Alot of us were deciding between the triple dipper and the lunch express.  With the triple dipper you can pick 3 different appetizers for one price, about $14, and  the lunch express, I believe was either soup salad and a sandwich, for about $11-12. I was surprised they had a lunch special that included the chicken fajita with a cup of soup for about $13, so I ordered that with a cup of the chicken tortilla soup.  Half way through our appetizers, one of co-workers let out a small gasp/scream.  She was drinking water and found a spider at the bottom of her cup, at the end of her straw.  EEeeeewww! We told another waitress who quickly apologized, took away the glass and replaced with another.  We were expecting the manager or at least acknowledgement from our waitress but nothing. As we were finishing our lunch... I also found an ant on my drinking water (outside not in...thank goodness!). Anyway, the manager came to our table afterwards and apologized AND comped my co-worker's lunch as well as my own.  Which helped since we also got dessert. Dessert is always good.   As for the other two locations.  Waitresses were also very friendly and eager to please, eventhough it was busy when we went.  The food is ok... Nothing to brag about or specifically go there for.  It is a good place to have appetizers and talk story.  It helps if you go during happy hour, since all appetizers are $2 off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=440

We were (especially me!) was very disappointed that there was NO applewood smoked bacon-just cheap bacon. I asked the waiter and he said that it's no longer available- for a month now. I told him (Kendi) that can't be since my husband and I had JUST had it last week-there & I had it last month at the Chili's Waikele. A mgr (I'm assuming she's a manager-did not introduce herself) came to our table. She stated the bacon has not been available for 2 months and the cooks did not know how to cook it correctly. What the..? I had already let the incident go...but Then another mgr came to our table and stated that it hasn't been available for 6 months. WHAT?! He too did not introduce himself. We've been going to Chili's Kahala since it first opened. And the menu has been updated and HAS the Applewood bacon. $14 hamburger! Extemely disappointed with no applewood bacon and the LIES! There's been other problematic time, but this took the cake-with the lies. My lemons was served in a plastic cup cap cover and Kendi the waiter states that the dishes were being washed. WTF?
