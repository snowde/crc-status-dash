Roger B.,"Mooresville, NC",15,51,77,5.0,8/14/2017,"Have taken my wife here several times for lunch because her work is nearby. Always great service. Love the 2 for $22 menu choices. Chips and salsa are one of our favorite appetizers. She likes the flavored tea here. Good burgers, awesome fajitas among other great choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Jamie M.,"Huntersville, NC",5,148,44,5.0,7/20/2017,"The only Chilis I'll go back to. We always seem to get the same waiter (still can't remember his name) but he always remembers us as well. He's definitely a hard worker, knows how to get good tips. The food is always on point. Staff knows how to make a mean raspberry sweet tea & best thing.... we're always greeted with a smile & when we leave we're always told to have a great day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Jeremy D.,"Denver, NC",126,2,,1.0,10/29/2017,"Order was incorrect, took 45 minutes to replace, replacement was incorrect, when we asked if they could do Something they took off five dollars from a 30 dollar bill. Not exactly correcting the problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Jonathan S.,"Atlanta, GA",0,8,,2.0,11/24/2017,"Definitely would not recommend this chili's. We started off with chips and queso. The chips were adequate but the queso was horrendous. It was very unappealing and tasted horrible + the plate was chipped. Service was was alright. The service provided was ok. We sat by the open kitchen, big Mistake in which we heard workers making loud noise in the back. My entree was the boneless chicken wings. Might as well have gone to McDonalds, get bbq sauce and save my $12. Overall my experience was unpleasant and am not returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Kim M.,"Cornelius, NC",77,35,29,2.0,1/6/2017,"2 stars only because management handled the issue extremely well. 94.5 sanitation grade almost has us walk out but decided to give it a chance. Based on the food alone, I wouldn't have even given it one star. But since the waitress and manager were apologetic and wanted to correct the issue I gave 2.  *see pics of burgers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Tori H.,"Charlotte, NC",503,523,290,2.0,3/7/2016,"My food tasted ok until the lady in front of me found not 1 but 2 hairs in her food. Now I'm pretty good at reading faces and she looked like she was being very honest. I was so grossed out I couldn't eat anymore! I loved our server and hate that the experience was not great. My husband's quesadilla explosion salad had chunks of chicken that looked like they weren't even grilled. Just blah blahhhh.  Oh, and for the record...I had to go to this chain because I lost a bet (Duke lost vs UNC) but I generally have enjoyed chilis in the past!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Sarah S.,"Cornelius, NC",27,56,80,2.0,6/19/2016,I went for lunch with my husband. Didn't feel it was very clean or anything over the top. The hostess had her hand on a piece of my salad when she brought t to the table. Our waitress was not friendly . I don't think we will be back knowing there are better options for food and service elsewhere.  We had a gift card so that's the end of that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Shahab A.,"Huntersville, NC",0,5,,2.0,12/20/2016,"Week before Christmas, with family and friends from out of town. The upper management at this restaurant decided to under staff. Really what are they thinking? There were empty tables but only a couple of servers. Not fair to the young servers or the manager on staff. We were going to have 8 people over but the host said ""15-20 min wait"" and we see empty tables . Oh well the party decided to go else where. We waited though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Courtney C.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,15,,1.0,9/2/2016,First visit and had the WORST service I have ever experienced at a Chili's.  Will never go back to this location. Food was mediocre at best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Dianna G.,"Charlotte, NC",31,25,11,2.0,2/12/2017,They have great food at this location always well cooked and always comes out hot but I'm giving this location 2 stars which I rather give them 1 star because management is awful and I'm saying that nicely the first bad experience I had was on my birthday and the second bad experience with management was last night . Let's just say this will be my LAST time ever eating at this location and for all my friends and family as well . The manager is RUDE DISRESPECTFUL and UNPROFESSIONAL. She is not a friendly person she honestly looks like she hates her job. I will be calling to get a hold of the district manager and will call cooperate to explain to them my horrible  experience. I don't want anything for free for the inconvenience it's nothing like that I just really hope they reconsider who they have as their manager here. This is not someone I would want managing my company.  I will not get into detail on here but I'm warning anyone who eats here stay away from the manager . If you look at any of my other reviews I am not one to write bad reviews I'm a very humble and easy going person .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Kevin M.,"Las Vegas, NV",174,19,4,2.0,7/2/2016,"After writing my review last November, I did receive a gift certificate and apology from someone with Chili's.  However, I never took them up on the offer to make it up to me.  I appreciated the customer service effort, but I have no desire to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Jose C.,"Sterling, VA",7,35,102,4.0,8/14/2015,"Great food as always had the buffalo boneless chicken salad, very tasty. Chili's is always a good place to come to if you get home sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Melissa G.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,,5.0,1/21/2017,Had a wonderful experience. Fantastic server and if you go ask for server named Bruce. Great personality and amazing service. Have to see to believe...... And the margaritas are fantastic........,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Reid R.,"Omaha, NE",141,238,224,5.0,7/24/2015,"Food was perfect, waitress was great, everything on time, food was perfect temperature, and their menu has a lot of new options",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Billy M.,"Huntersville, NC",18,20,6,1.0,5/16/2016,Eat here with my family often.  The service here has dropped off!  Horrible servers!  Not a happy experience.  Felt like I was at McDonalds!  Server has no interest in making us feel like we were dining out.  Treated us like we were an inconvenience! Not happy and hope management notices and fixes problem soon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Aline F.,"Huntersville, NC",17,1,,1.0,4/28/2016,"I walked in and ordered a burger and two kids burger to go. I was told 20 min but after 1 hr I was able to get my food. During the long wait I could witness how dirty and disgusting was the kitchen. The servers were taking orders, manipulating money and then preparing food without any sanitation. One of the servers decided to lick her fingers while preparing a dessert and then touched the food again. I threw my food in the garbage when I got home and will NEVER EVER go back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Ethan E.,"Caledon, Canada",0,1,,3.0,2/12/2016,"Great Food,Good Service! However I do not recommend you get broccoli from this location, they don't wash it properly and I tasted dirt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Maggie V.,"Charlotte, NC",105,93,343,3.0,6/5/2015,"Food always good. Had all shrimp  fajitas without tortillas. But service today was sloooooow. Server seamed distracted. Coffee was cold. No spoon  for coffee, no sugar. Had to keep calling him to the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Stephanie E.,"Stanley, NC",0,1,,1.0,7/6/2016,"Today was the fifth visit in a row that we have had to send food back. Each time, management comes out and blames the server. New food usually takes 20-30 minutes to come back out, so everyone else has eaten. We had a server drop a knife on our son and swear in front of him. We've had cold food, raw food, burnt food, etc. We kept going back because it used to be so well run and the food was great. Not anymore. Don't waste your time. There are too many other great restaurants around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Alex B.,"Huntersville, NC",0,4,,1.0,4/9/2016,"Ordered take out which was scheduled to be ready by 8:20....well 8:50 rolls around and I finally get my take out. The take out is right beside the kitchen and all you see and hear is yelling and cursing. Food was also below average which I expected from the chaos that was happening. Also, my apartment is 2 minutes from the restaurant and by the time I got home, everything felt like it was pulled straight out of the fridge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville
Ryan N.,"Hyattsville, MD",2,3,,1.0,3/15/2015,"We went in, set at the table for 10 min.  4 waitresses and the host walked by us without making any contact.  Table was sticky as if a dirty rag was used to clean it.  After walking out we find the manager hanging out at the door.  He did offer to take care of us but after sitting down for 10 min without any contact we left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville?start=20
Rick R.,"Ashburn, VA",0,2,,1.0,12/5/2015,My wife and I have eaten at many Chilis restaurants across the country. We love Chilis and in particular the fajitas. We have tried this restaurant a few times since moving to the area a year ago. Each time the service has been mediocre and the food OK but not to Chilis standard... Very disappointing! Tonight we sat in the bar.. The bar tender was not very friendly. We asked for fajitas with extra crispy onions... The steak was tough... The chicken was barely cooked and it looked like the peppers and onions were thrown on at the last minute! We will not be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville?start=20
Mark M.,"Huntersville, NC",2,16,2,3.0,11/5/2014,"Would be one star if it wasn't for Gail our server. Let's get it together here people, common sense tells me sitting 2 cops beside a couple enjoying a few adult beverages is an immediate buzz kill. Sending a socially awkward manager around around that ask 2 tables out of six in the area how they are doing...well what's the point? I use term ""manager"" loosely bc he never introduced himself, had no name tag & frankly looked like bum in his stripped shirt. Step it up Chilies...will update next visit",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville?start=20
Ryan L.,"Charlotte, NC",43,65,74,3.0,12/30/2011,"Went here during one of my lunch time excursions. I decided to give them another chance and see if a year or so had changed the chain. Well... The restaurant is your typical Chili's cookie cutter interior design. If you've been to one, you've been to them all. Tables and floors were clean, especially during the lunch time rush, so I give them a thumbs up for that. We were seated fairly quickly and our server came around in an adequate amount of time.  Looking through that menu though brought back memories of 2009. I could've swore it was 2011! Oh, I am right, it is 2011. Not much has changed in their menu, except the occasional ""Tex-Mex"" item dashed throughout the menu. I opted for an easy and hopefully satisfying unlimited chili and salad for $7 something. They gave us salsa and chips to snack on while we waited for the entrees.  I am a little particular with my chili, so don't get me wrong, I know what I paid for. But anyways, it was a very average chili bowl (didn't even qualify to be a bowl, more like two hand scoops). The meat was chunks of chicken and beef, each smashed into little bits and squished into small balls and sprinkled here and there until the quota was met. I swore I only had three solid beans in there. The rest seemed to be mashed in with the runny broth. I swear Wendy's has better Chili and they're fast food! The Caesars salad was just as disappointing. CHUNKS of cheese?! You couldn't take the time to grate it out and instead left me with four slices of cheese. Really?  Service was excellent though. Always attentive and speedy. My three stars go to the food and not the waiters or staff. I know they have some good picks here and there in the menu, which is another reason why I didn't give it a one for my mediocre lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville?start=20
Richard K.,"Charlotte, NC",1,16,,4.0,5/28/2013,"I would give 4.5 stars if I could.  I save 5 stars for really amazing experiences, that way I'm not an every-'like'-is-5-stars guy.   We went to this location Sunday because the Northlake location has annoyed us - they changed their kitchen line a few months or so ago and so now the grilled chicken for stuff comes out without the 'cooked' lines and it honestly looks / seems like pre-cooked chicken that has just been heated (although not microwaved).   So we tried this Huntersville location - and were very happy.  The waitress, although very recently hired, was super nice, attentive (brought kids' new drinks without waiting to be called).   She talked with the manager to put in my request for vegetarian fajitas as part of the 2-for-20 deal and it came out perfect, it was super good and more than I could have asked for.   The chips & salsa are fairly normal - I wish the salsa was more Sonoran style but you can't have everything.  The kids food (grilled chicken and various sides) and my wife's food (margarita chicken) was good and cooked properly.  The restaurant was not very crowded, which I understand based on location.  They are a bit messed up because of the crazy way they re-did that intersection.  The bartender forgot the orange wedge on my Blue Moon, but that's not a big deal, I only mention it in case the restaurant people read this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville?start=20
Brent F.,"Huntersville, NC",65,13,,4.0,2/24/2014,"Decent food, good prices. what you would expect from a large chain. This location stands out due to the staff. We've always had great service. Very attentive and we never run out of drinks or chips. Several of the staff have been around for a while and always take a moment to come say hello to our girls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville?start=20
Ann K.,"Jefferson County, KY",5,32,7,5.0,11/8/2012,I had the Cajun Pasta and Shrimp. SOOOOO good.. Always love Chilis! The waitress was super nice and friendly. Food was hot and ready pretty quick.

Kim J.,"Huntersville, NC",2,27,20,5.0,9/12/2011,"My boyfriend and i go to this location about once a week.  We always sit in the bar area (much better environment, no huge parties or kids running around), and we LOVE it if we get Gary or Nicole as our waiter/waitress.  We always get great food and great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville?start=20
Steve Z.,"Cornelius, NC",8,12,4,1.0,11/11/2012,"Went in to eat on 11-10-12 and ordered the nachos to start.  Getting toward the bottom of chips, I grabbed a handful of small chips and dip it in my salsa and start to chew, well guess what I chomped down on, a piece of glass....yes, GLASS.  Told the waiter and he took the glass and I guess told a manager but no one came to me.  Lucky for me, I didn't get hurt but still.  I proceed to eat my ribs that I love and at the end of my last rib I now pull out a long ass hair.  Now I tell the waiter again and I say, ""now I want something at least comped"". He says oh yes sir, so sorry.  Me personally, If I was the Gm at this restaurant, I would of comped the whole meal.  This guy didn't even apologize and all he gave me was 8 dollars off for my ribs.  I love the food at chilis but I will never order from this chilis ever again in my life.  Piss poor management.  I still may call to the corporate offices and explain this situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville?start=20
Barrett S.,"Charlotte, NC",208,68,12,5.0,4/9/2009,"Do everything here, but take-out for lunch. See Mary-Beth inside at the bar; she rocks. Dining inside is always a pleasure; also, before 6 there are great ""happy hour"" specials....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-huntersville?start=20
