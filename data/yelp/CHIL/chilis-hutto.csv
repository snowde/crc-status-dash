Mom T.,"Austin, TX",0,30,,3.0,6/30/2015,Good place for a reasonably quick lunch. The Margarita Grilled Chicken is pretty good and relatively low cal.  Being able to quickly pay at the table on the 'tablet' is great. No need to wait for the check.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto?start=20

Rodney W.,"Hutto, TX",8,4,,1.0,7/12/2015,I gave one star because I can't give zero!  This was so ridiculous. I'm still fuming!  Basically this us how it went down. I ordered a coke to be served in a frosted glass from the bar. Something thst I always ask for and happily granted. Today the waiter flat our refused to do it for me. Told me they NEVER put non-alcoholic beverages in those glass glasses. I told him they always do it for me. He wouldn't listen and basically just blew me off. We got up and walked out immediately!  I'm just blown away by the lack of customer service by this little ass!  I called the manager and he was just as shocked as I was.

Jacklyn D.,"Round Rock, TX",45,5,,1.0,6/9/2016,"Well to be honest we usually go to the Chilis in stone hill (Pflugerville) but now that we are closer to hutto and my in-laws live there we thought we would go there. I hate to say it but it was the worst experience we have ever had and I go to Chilis about 2-3 times a month. We ordered margaritas which we were all sure that they didn't add any liquor and I'm ashamed to say I am usually buzzed off 1/2 of a margarita.. it took 20 minutes to take our order, then they didn't bring out the salads, I finally asked about them about 15 minutes later.. I will say they were busy but it was just 2 salads. it took about 50 minutes to get our food, which we were patient because our server was new and they were a little crowded, but when the food came out it, there was no sauce on my MIL ribs, my steak which was supposed to me medium was WELL WELL done.. I literally scraped the char off the meat. I could keep going but my point is that it was very disappointing. Especially since we live so close now and I love going there and usually would go a few times a month. I sure hope that they work out whatever is going on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto?start=20
Jimmy L.,"San Jose, CA",33,854,133,4.0,7/15/2013,"I know that they are a typical Chili's, but since I set my expectations accordingly, I like the chain for what it is, and the food works well for my digestive system and gastronomics. Since they are a chain, they are also consistent, which I am phappy with. We're traveling from out of town, and they're close to the Holiday Inn. I know that Hutto is a small town, so it's nice to see that they have something mainstream. We came here right at their 10:30 pm closing, and the servers were all super nice, and treated us like regulars. I ordered drinks, and made sure I knew that they would stop serving at some point. This is what I ordered - ""Three flour tortillas with crispy chicken, applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, cheese, lettuce, honey-chipotle drizzle and ranch dressing."" This comes with rice and beans, though I ordered no beans extra rice. It was all good and fresh, peeps were nice, and they didn't screw it up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto?start=20

M F.,"Pflugerville, TX",22,82,41,1.0,7/30/2013,"I have never enjoyed the thought of going to this Chillis.  I thought I'd try it again with my family of six last night since we had a coupon for a free appetizer... Let me say again, I was greatly reminded of why I hate this place.  Put yourself in my heels... #1.  Our waitress was a girl with dark short hair and a red bandana tied around her head (maybe so someone can have a talk with her).... Doubt it though.  She literally approached our table by saying ""just letting you guys know my name is _______ and they just cut me from working an all day shift and I'm exhausted so I'll be starting your order but the other waitress is kindof new... (pause)... She's somewhere in the back.... (pause)... So uh, when she comes out I guess we'll just do it like that."" WTF??  She actually said this all very slow, with a little more talking too and my table was like, is she kidding right now???  Too much drama if you ask me, we're just here to eat and don't care about how unorganized the restaurant is OR how tired YOU are!  What ever happened to customer service?? #2.  It took ten minutes to get two house margaritas and one tropical sunrise, two kids drinks, and a tea.  (This is so late on a Monday there were only about four tables dining in at the time.)  When the other waitress dropped them off, the two house margaritas were missing the top inch and a half of drink!!  I said ""um, excuse me, but it looks like someone just drank our drinks so can you actually bring them full??"" the waitress, ""oh, you want them topped off?"" YES!  *head in hands* #3.  It took ONE HOUR... That's right, one whole hour to get four appetizers!  Nachos, potato skins, egg rolls, and fries.  Really?!?  Can someone please tell me why the hell it takes ONE HOUR for these simple little portions of food??  Wtf?  In one hour I could have changed my car oil myself, polished my toenails, watered my garden, sprayed some ant piles, and had a glass of wine.  What were they doing back there in the kitchen??  Is there even a kitchen?!  Cooks??  Jeez!   #4. I asked for jalapeños on the side for my potato skins, of course they didn't come out, so I asked Rosie The Rivetter who was cleaning the section around us for them and she said, ""oh they didn't come out?  Hold on a sec."". She goes back to the kitchen, then walks right by our table with a new rag to wipe down her tables and continues to clean... I'm sure you know I never got them... This place is slow, unapologetic, wrapped up in themselves, and severely lacking on their customer service.  STEP UP YOUR GAME and focus on your guests!!  Thank goodness we didn't order actual entrees cause we would have been skeletons with drinks in our hands by the time the food came out!  Ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto?start=20

Do not eat here. I asked to speak to a manager twice..first time I was told we are too busy...second time they laughed at me.

Shawn H.,"Hutto, TX",8,43,,2.0,6/6/2010,"Given this is a chain, so you can't expect anything terribly unique, but whether it's this location or the chain in general, this restaurant has fallen off our rotation (and considering the small number of options for Hutto dining, that says something). The food doesn't seem to have the extra zing that I remember Chili's having, and the waitstaff falls somewhere between mildly attentive to oblivious depending on the night. The drinks are overpriced, but I know that's the chain so I won't fault this location.

Betty R.,"Hutto, TX",125,82,,3.0,11/20/2011,"Ate at Chili's today and I was not impressed. We got our order to go and we do eat there on occasion, but today was takeout. We ordered two of their Old Timer burgers. The burgers were cooked how we wanted, and the bread was not soggy but it was bland. They were a little on the dry side, and the patty tends to be a little thick for my taste. We also got their crispy onion and jalapeno stack, and that was terrible. They were all stuck together in one lump of batter and onions (there were only like 3 jalapenos in the stack). The batter was way too salty, overly crispy, and dry. I did not like these at all and I did not even eat them. That was a wasted $4. We picked up on time so the food was not cold, but it was on the bland side. Their burgers need more seasoning. The restaurant was dead when we went to pick up our food, so it would have been nice to stay and eat. There is usually a long wait on the weekends! Service was average so no complaints there. Their menu does have too many choices and could stand to be priced more reasonably.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto?start=40

Meghan M.,"Hutto, TX",0,1,,1.0,6/22/2017,"Whoever owns the Chili's in Hutto really needs to get their ducks in a row!  We only visit this restaurant when we don't want to drive the extra 10-15 minutes to the Stone Hill location.  I think the only reason this restaurant is still open is because of the convenience and the brand.  The staff is hit or miss, some people are great but most of them need to be re-trained and then re-trained again.   On one occasion, I ordered a salad to-go and they FORGOT THE LETTUCE.  On another occasion, I ordered a side salad in place of french fries to-go and they forgot to give me the salad completely so I had to go back.   This last trip though really takes the cake....  My friend and I were seated and attended to quickly at the beginning.  We ordered an appetizer and one strawberry alcoholic drink that was new to the menu.  After about 15-20 minutes our server comes by to see how we are doing and then says ""Oh!  You had an appetizer..  It must still be cooking in the back.  I'll go check on it and bring you your drink in a minute."" then we order the rest of our food.  I have come to expect slow service from this place and we aren't in any rush thankfully so it's not a big deal.  Our server brings the drink out and the appetizer then walks away without asking if everything is okay.  The app is fine but my drink isn't the right flavor.  She brought out the original vodkatini thing instead of the strawberry.  Again, not a big deal in the grand scheme of things because I'm going to drink it regardless because that's just me but I did want to bring it to her attention that it wasn't what I asked for.  When she came back around and I told her ""It's not a big deal because I'm going to drink it anyways but I did originally ask for this to be strawberry."" her response was ""You want strawberries?"" Me: 'No, no, I had asked for the strawberry version of this drink, it's on the menu' Her: ""do you want me to bring you a side of strawberry syrup?"" Me: 'um, no that's..okay.  It's fine. Thank you.'           How odd, right??     Moving on to the actual meal, my friend gets her food and everything looks good, I get my salad (quesadilla explosion salad) and the lettuce is brown...  At this point I have given up all hope on this joint and its ability to handle salads. (Over the years I have gotten the burgers and the club sandwiches and they turn out OK) Other chili's restaurants kick this chili's butt majorly when it comes to quality and taste of food but again it all boils down to convenience. I never said anything about the salad because it's late and I didn't feel like waiting another 20-30 minutes for a new salad that probably wouldn't be much better.  FINALLY, once we have finished eating and our conversation has died down we realized we haven't seen our server once after she brought us our entrees.  My friend pays her half of the meal with her CC on the little tablet that sits on the table but I want to pay with cash so I have to wait until our server decides to come back and check on us.  About 5 minutes goes by and she finally comes over to us and I ask for a copy of my receipt because I would like to pay with cash then she looks at me like I have grown a second head.  My bill is $19 and some odd change, I hand her a $20 with my receipt and she says she will be back with my change. ..... ... ..... She brings me $20 in change back. Oh, also our server mentioned that the GM of the restaurant wants to make the menu smaller because it's hard on the waitstaff to remember everything-    note to GM-  HIRE BETTER STAFF.  You shouldn't have to change your restaurant because your staff can't handle their jobs.  I have worked in a multitude of kitchens and it blows my mind EVERY TIME how terrible this place is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto

At 2:00 my husband was finally annoyed enough to get the attention of a different waiter, to ask him to find ours. Several minutes later, our waiter arrived with our food. Our greasy, barely warm, congealed food. The burgers were dry, the steak was overdone, and the cheese on all the plates was hard as a rock. The food had obviously sat for a long time. My husband asked the waiter about his burger (which should have had onion rings but instead had raw onions) and the waiter argued with him for several minutes. The waiter apologized for the wait AND told us that he knew it wasn't our ""fault"" that we came at a busy time but we did. Finally, a manager came over and told us he could remake the food but it would take just as long. No thanks. We left and got our lunch at another restaurant. How disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto
Jose P.,"Round Rock, TX",0,25,7,1.0,12/9/2015,"Food is always the same!!!  Restaurant was empty on a monday night and the waiting for food was too much.  Waited about 20 minutes for a soup and about 40 for the entree.  I was sitting at the bar and it made no sence... Will travel more next time, but will never visit this chilis again!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto
Kathleen H.,"Hutto, TX",0,27,,1.0,8/5/2017,Man we were sooo hungry... we sat down sat for like 10 min no one came and asked us for drinks or anything. There was a stand behind us and 3 people standing there. The crisper tasted so weird and where is the chicken?? They were thin prices if breading. The one on limestone is worth the extra miles and time. Service is 3x better. I can not stress the chicken was awful the taste was weird like the sauce was made wrong. I promise this location is a waste of time. But the lime stone is amazing i am an assistant General manager  at a casual dining like this and if i saw any of my crew just walk past a table there wpuld be words and i would know that the table is not helped. We were looking around for 10 min for someone. Servers act like they only can help their table TEAM WORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK DON'T Y'ALL KNOW THAT SMH SAD PLACE  my babies pizza was burnt and my burger was undercooked. Food safety big thing. But it's ok we won't be back to this location HANDS DOWN WORST LOCATION IN RR/PF/HUTTO AREA,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto
Victoria R.,"Austin, TX",191,41,12,5.0,9/9/2015,"I am all for giving credit where credit is due. We had GREAT service coming to this location for dinner. Our server, his name was Sean, came to our table frequently to refill our drinks, he was very attentive, & worked hard. I appreciate servers like him. Going above & beyond for customers, he not only did his job but did it with PRIDE. Thank you Sean! The food was great as well. 5 stars for this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto
Dawn L.,"Hutto, TX",230,6,1,2.0,4/23/2015,"Food takes forever to come out, we've been here almost an hour just waiting on food.  It is sooooo cold in the bar, it's UNENJOYABLE!.  Last time we came, fajitas were served cold, and it took an hour and half from time we at down to order to get our food.  My waitress is nice, sweet and tenative.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto
diane b.,"Honolulu, HI",73,7,,5.0,4/4/2016,Had a great experience. We had Trevor as our waiter. He recommended great drinks and great meals. He was always around if we needed something. Our drinks and food came out quickly and he didn't show disappointment to get a table with two kids!  A good experience is always on the waiter and I recommend requesting Trevor!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto
Sylvia C.,"Harker Heights, TX",67,1,,1.0,3/5/2016,"What kind of restaurant throws their servers under the bus?  The hostess needs a reality check on teamwork. We were seated and obviously their ""buddy"" ""wasn't a very good server"" either. Verbatim. Chili's lost at least a $100 check from us. Starving from the Warrior Dash too. If you work at the same place, unless you are in corporate work, which is still petty, work FOR each other. I won't stop going to Chili's when the rare occasion to eat out comes along, but I will never go to this one again. Glad I see a lot of people in my daily business. They will know about the immaturity level and lack of helping one another at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutto
