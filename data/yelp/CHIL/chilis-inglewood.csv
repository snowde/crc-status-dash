Melissa M.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,9/10/2017,"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! Just picked up a to-go order, 2 for $22 special - we got the black bean veggie burger with the cajun shrimp alfredo pasta and the chefs prepared it perfectly!! Great atmosphere in the restaurant too, real family vibes.. They were even playing Flash Light by Parliament-Funkadelic - 10/10 service...The water cups were even top quality, not just rotted tap water with ice lol (First online review I've ever written in my life - honestly too many people are so quick to leave reviews when things go wrong, but when everything is just right it goes unacknowledged most of the time... so shout out to inglewood chilis!) good vibes - boyfriend",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood
Foodiekoo L.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,9,,1.0,7/23/2017,"Left the Inglewood Chilis WITHOUT eating at around 630pm yesterday. We initially were waiting for a regular table for 4 (30-45 min wait, that's fine) but saw an open seat after 20 min in the bar. So my  group and I stood next to the table thinking it would be cleaned off soon, I even asked the host... 2 more more tables opened up in the bar more guest stood by those. STILL NO ONE came to clean them. On group left after 15 min. I went to the host stand twice, they said they would call someone over. The manager Kenneth who I saw multiple times during our wait walking around aimlessly finally came over and cleaned ONE table in 3 trips VERY slowly. Seriously I've worked in restaurants, I can understand when it's busy however when a manager doesn't move to the current pace of the restaurant then it's a hindrance to the process of serving the customer and a burden to their staff.  Whether they were understaffed or under prepared for the concert down the street as a manager Kenneth needed to hustle better, be helpful to his staff, observant, and be more apologetic to waiting guest.  GO to the Red Lobster next door, the service and food were great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood

Kristinia R.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,6,15,3.0,1/7/2018,The waiter was wonderful. He gave great service and he made sure we had anything in a timely manner. My only complaint is the chicken on my fajita platter had a weird taste to it. Also there was not enough meat on the platter. The steak and shrimp portion taste was great but the chicken wasn't great at all. Also their drinks (alcohol) were good as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood

Polanco O.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/6/2018,"I love chili's but this location is very bad, very bad customer service. As I arrived the person that seats you was having a conversation with another employee as we waited for her to be done and then sat us. As I received my order we received the wrong order and had to wait for it, we received it and waited for another order we had done and the lady had forgotten about it so we had to ask for it again as we almost finished our meals. We were also so mad because we needed an extra fork that we asked for and never got it, luckily we found a fork our selves. Please don't go their and consider looking for another location!!!

Adrian P.,"Hawthorne, CA",37,97,468,2.0,6/27/2017,"This review is for the night of 6/24/2017 Came to chilis last night and the service was horrible, we came during happy hour and the waitress we had was terrible.  She took 30 minutes to bring us our first drinks, 15 minutes to bring additional ranch for our Texas cheese fries and left off a couple of things from the main entree I ordered, which were the fajitas.  The food was excellent, however, she forgot to put the white queso on the fajitas as I requested although it was showing up on my ordering kiosk.  She seemed out of place and was not very attentive to her area as she was often seen dawdling in the kitchen conversing with other staff.  The manager we spoke to ironed things out for us so he relieved some of the bad service that we did experience that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood

When we received our food, we were missing a few items, I asked for a substitute and they forgot. The also forgot to the ranch and sour cream we ordered.

Sad thing is all the staff is black and so am I, so I ain't just saying it to say it. They need to do a full re-hire from the ground up. They had tables dirty for over thirty minutes.

Tammy J.,"Los Angeles, CA",558,149,678,4.0,1/16/2017,"We went to this Chili's location because we did not feel like driving a long distance, and we were pleasantly surprised to find such abundant parking. We decided to sit at the bar rather than a table so that we would get better service and watch games more easily on the multiple TVs behind and surrounding the bar. My guy ordered a tall Angel City IPA, and I had Jalepeno Margarita, both of which paired well with the Three Combination Meats that we shared.  For the meats, we chose the Craft Beer BBQ Ribs, BBQ Chicken, and Spicy BBQ Sausage.  The meal came with fries, street corn, and pickles. The food tasted good, and the bartender served us pretty quickly. For  $38.80 (before tip), we thought that it was a pretty good deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood
Angie R.,"Fresno, CA",24,154,394,5.0,9/24/2016,"My sister, niece and I came here on Thursday (9-22-16). When we first arrived it was packed!!!! So there was a wait of 20 minutes. The host was very friendly and nice. So my family and I decided to go for walk until they text us that our table is ready. About 15 minutes they text us our table is ready and we report to Chilis. Upon entering we were promptly seated and they provided us a booster seat for my 2 year old niece. My sister was worried that Chilis did not accommodate little ones and I reassured her that they do! They gave my niece a little play book to color in but if you know 2 year old niece everything was in pieces before we ordered our drinks and the crayon was no where to be found! Sorry Chilis! Gotta love kids. My sister and I ordered our food and didn't know my nieces play book was a menu too! And so we ordered her food. But she didn't like her meal she had Mac and cheese along with French Fries. She loved the French Fries! I tried the Mac and cheese and it wasn't too bad. She is just too picky! So our meals arrives about 5 min after hers and we chow down. I had a chipotle chicken bowl and my sister had the Rib burrito so yummy! The food was amazing. My niece was having a good time and playing with the staff members by giving them high 5s as they walked which drew attention from other patrons who thought that it was too cute and wanted a high 5 from her too! Overall my sister, niece and I really enjoyed our time at Chilis. My first time dining at this chain and it was nice to see a dominance of color for once! Also when we left there was live entertainment outside! Can't get better than that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood

Just keep it real, we I had a gift card in my wallet from Chilly's and I was both hungry and try too save some money so know all this and knowing they have a HALLY HOUR! Give it another try.  I was pleasantly surprised not be because the service in the restaurant but of Crystal, the young lady that was taking the to go order's.  I told her what I said here on Yelp and her response ""well hopefully I can change your mind and that she did. She was attentive professional and explain to me and answer all my questions in the menu and what I was still kind of confused she gave a suggestion which was the Cajun pasta take care of it for me even got me a glass of water when I was waiting.  There was gentleman before that came back because his order was no right and she toqok care of that real quick fast and hurry also apologize for the inconvenience. It doesn't sound like much  but Crystal's customer service was very much appreciated​.  So much so that I let the manager know.  So does it sound like I'll be back?

They closed at 11pm we got there at 10:40pm and we waited in the lobby until 11:15pm until anyone even acknowledged us . My friend asked the manager who did we need to speak to in order to be taken care of and he said he needed to take care of the lager party before he could do anything for us. He didn't end up seating us until about 11:30 . The staff had bad attitudes . Our waitress slid our drinks and food on the table and just walked away w|o straws for our drinks or even asking if we needed anything else . I will not be returning to this place . We didn't even have napkins at our table . I asked for some and more lemons for my water ... it took forever for me to get them !

I went the night of 8/28/16 and was treated as if I was a random person on the street. initially, I wasn't greeted when I walked in and when I finally received a greeter's attention and asked if a section was open, he directed me to ask another waiter. I walked out of the restaurant after a waiter motioned to me to move out the way because I was blocking the bar and said I needed to move rudely and I had to ask for a wash cloth to clean my own table. There was food all over the table and floor and the staff looked at me as if I should have been fine with the table looking the way it looked. It was the absolute worst service I have ever received. The manager did not know how to correct the customer service issues and his staff after one of his staff members cursed him out.  I would never recommend anyone to go to this location.

Robyn C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,36,16,1.0,8/26/2017,"Went to chilis on Wednesday for my big sisters birthday. It's sad cause we go there pretty often and that day was special and we had the worse experience. First off we got there at 9 didn't get seated till 9:20 & it wasn't even busy at all. We sat down it took 15 mins for us to get drinks. We didn't get straws, silverware or small plates. We had to ASK FOR THEM. Which that common since to bring those things first. It took us almost an he to get food, some of the plates had cold food, others were totally wrong orders. When they gave us silverware it was actually plastic my friend had to cut her FUCKIN steak w a plastic knife like are u serious. Then another waitress kept ear hustling coming to our table giving excuses on why are other waitress didn't do certain things making us more irritated. Like this was suppose to be a good dinner for my big sister and it was ruined. I live down the street but won't be coming to this location ever again I'd rather take the drive and go somewhere else.

When I ask for my kids drinks with no ice she said they don't have ice.She will b back to take our order. she came back after 25mins like really my kids were hungry and asking for their food. By then their drinks haven't arrived. Finally after my babies drinks arrived the sodas they come in adult size and with ice! And Still forgot to bring chocolate milk!

Paper all over the floor, the floors are wet and since they're so dirty it looks like it's filled with mud!! Then we finally get seated 30 minutes later, it's about 15-20 minutes after that before someone asks if we've had a server come to us. We order our food and it arrives 40 minutes later.

Krystal C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,23,17,1.0,6/8/2017,The staff is not customer focused at all. They were highly unprofessional as I sit near the kitchen hearing them curse back and forth at each other. They were threatening each other because of a heated discussion. There was a man eating food off the plate in the kitchen. This was right before closing so I understood that they might be tired. I did voice my concern to the server and she said that they were highly understaffed due to some unforeseen events with their employees. My server was great. She was on point and very thorough although she did get my drink order wrong. That could have been the bar tender though. The host walked away from the door and was MIA for 13 minutes. Guest got angry and were making a scene. No one came to help. Just let customers gather at the door angry.

Jason N.,"Hawthorne, CA",11,8,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Where to begin? My girlfriend and I took my parents to this Chili's for my mother's birthday. First our waitress seemed confused on how to place orders on the handheld device. Once we had placed our orders (we had to remind her of who still had not ordered). First we were told that they had run out of the ingredients for virgin margaritas, then we had to wait an obscene amount of time before our food came which wouldn't have been noticeable if not for the fact that all of the tables around us who were seated after us had received their food before us. Then once the food had arrived, it was either overcooked or undercooked (it should be hard to mess up quesadillas but here we are) My mother had to send back her plate because of the burnt rice and to make matters worse, we asked for the staff to sing happy birthday to my mother and after they sang to every other birthday in the restaurant, I had to remind them to sing for my mother too.

Once seated the benches are torn and look like a spring is about to bust through when you sit down. Now the reason for at least 3 stars was our server, I believe her name was Jackie. She took our order and got it right she took great care of the girls and remained attentive. Hats off to her! !!  So Chill's get it together and fix this location to fit the service.

I was so frustrated seeing that everyone around us had there food and drinks. It's no surprise they have 2 stars, my fault for not checking the yelp review before I stepped in to this horrible place.

Re'Aunna A.,"La Mirada, CA",35,17,2,1.0,5/16/2017,"Why didn't I consider checking reviews prior to visiting? ‍ At her choice, I treated my grandmother to a late mothers day lunch at Chilis. I understand its not going to be parallel to the service if a five course white tablecloth restaurant but, professionalism at least?  Upon entering, my grandmother and I were greeted with ""we dont have no seats right now you can sit anywhere at the bar""  No option to wait, no ""HELLO"" or ""WELCOME"", nothing. Luckily we found a booth in the bar area as I dont want my 85 year old grandmother on a barstool. After more than 10 minutes we were finally greeted by a waiter who wanted to take our drink order. Nice try sir, we wont see you again for a while so you're taking our food order as well.  We politely asked for ice for my grandmothers iced tea, did we ever get it? Nope. We just gave up and ordered another. We were here about 4pm. The bar area was not crowded at all and majority of the parties there when we arrived had already had their meal so it wasnt as if we had to wait for multiple tables to receive their orders first.  There was no sense of urgency or care to the customers there. We had to ask for items that should have already been available like,silverware, napkins, etc.  Granny and I agreed that was our last time visiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=20

The guest joking around with the waitress in the middle of the aisle while others are trying to enjoy their meal. Some idiot going from table to table flirting with other guest and passing waitresses. The lousy service my friend and i received. The waitress took my order and left. Didnt even ask my buddy for his order until she came back and he was ready before i was. So dysfunctional here. My food was warm... warm! Its shouldve been hot. I ordered pasta.

I had to find my own table and when i found it I asked three servers to clean the table none of them did so. It took for me to ask for a Manager (who didn't come by until 45minutes after me asking for him) The bar area and surrounding area was filled with dirty plates, dirty glasses and several serves and bartenders playing ""basketball"" with napkins I made a comment to the server about the dirty glasses by the bar and she said ""there's a sink behind there thats why the glasses are there"" i then repeat the same comment to the manager his response was "" I've been in the business for over 20years trash will get on the floor) The overall experience was the worst and it wasn't busy in the store at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=20
Kim K.,"Northridge, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/22/2017,"My experience at Chili's, Inglewood on Century Blvd. on Saturday, October 14, 2017.  I called in an order for pickup, which was the Cajun Chicken Pasta. I drove to the restaurant and picked it up and when I got home, I started eating and noticed that the chicken was NOT cooked all the way. I was not about to eat raw poultry, so I immediately called and the woman who answered (did not get her name, but she sounded like the woman who rang me up, when picked my food up) and I explained to her that my chicken was not fully cooked. She asked me if I wanted to drive back to the restaurant and exchange the pasta for something else. I told her that I'm not driving all the way back over there and I asked her to please just refund my card. She then asked if I wanted to come back tomorrow and get something different and I again said no, and to please refund my card. She said that she'd have to have her manager, Will do the refund, but she'll make sure he does it right now and we then got off of the phone. I called back about 20 minuets later, just to make sure they already refunded my card and when I called, a woman answered by the name of Lakisha and I told her that I was calling to make sure my card has already been refunded and she said told me to hold on, then slammed the phone down and hung up on me. I called back again and a different person answered the phone and I told them the situation with the raw chicken and that I was calling to make sure Will refunded my card already. She then put me on hold and said she'd go ask Will. She came back to the phone and said that Will told her that he was waiting to speak with me on the phone, so he could get my card number, but said he's on his way to pick up the phone now and to hold for a couple of minutes. Will finally came to the phone and was super dry and didn't introduce himself, so I asked if I was speaking with Will and he said ""yes, who's this?"" I told him who I was and that I was told that he was waiting to speak with me, so he could refund my card. He said he didn't know what I was talking about and that his staff just told him that someone was on the phone for him, so he came to the phone and he knew nothing about my situation. I did not believe his story, but I proceeded to explain to him what happened with my food and that I wanted to be refunded. He NEVER apologized once, but instead, started defending his cooks and saying that they are very properly trained and they would never under cook chicken and so on. I told him that it sounds like he's implying that I'm not telling the truth, because he never apologized for my inconvenience, but instead defended his cooks. He then said that he's not implying anything, but he can't say that what I'm telling him really happened, because he never saw the meat himself. I told him, that statement right there implies that he's calling me a liar and that I don't appreciate, as a CUSTOMER, being insulted! He said that his staff always opens the to go box, to let the customer see the food, before they leave and he asked me if that happened and I told him that it had not. But, even if they did open the box to show it to me, it was the inside of the chicken that was not cooked all the way, so I wouldn't have been able to tell, just by glancing at the chicken on top of some pasta, if the middle had been cooked all the way through. I told him that I don't have time to call in an order, take my time and use my gas, to drive to the restaurant, pay for the food, then drive back home, just to call them and make up some story, for $15! I told him that I'd be making a complaint against him, because this is not how you treat customers and that he needs SERIOUS training in customer service. I told him that I wanted his information and he said that his name was Will and that's all I need to know. I asked what his managers name was and he said, Nico. I  advised that I'd be calling Nico about my horrible, insulting service that I received from him.  I called Chili's, the next day and Nico answered the phone. I explained the situation to her. She just listened and then said she'll have a conversation with Will about how they could have handled the situation better and she asked me if Will asked me to bring the food back and I told her, no and even if he had asked me to, I wasn't about to drive all the way back over there again to return the food to them and further inconvenience myself. Nico did not make me feel any better about the ordeal and what I went through. She was very dry and seemed very unfazed about the way Will treated me. It pretty much felt like she just wanted the call to be over and she sounded very fake in her apology. Will really made me feel extremely insulted. I am a very high integrity person, so to make me feel like I'm being deceptive and totally insulting me, about THEIR restaurant undercooking my poultry, is a horrible feeling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=20
Ada R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/11/2017,"Awful service!!!!!! Came on Saturday night, the hostess kept on sending everyone to the bar area, which didn't even have a single open space to seat!!!  After we got seated, I had to actually get someone's attention to order drinks, at least, because after fifteen minutes NO ONE had come to even get the drink order!  After we finally ordered drinks and two appetizers, another twenty minutes passed by with no drinks, nor appetizers.  We finally got up and left the place!!!! Without food or drinks ( after exactly 35min)....  It's either they don't have enough staff or they need some customer service training!!!  Either way, it was the worse experience ever!!!!!

We are seated and we noticed that surrounding tables are still not cleaned and at this point was an eye sore. Our waitress Lakesha was AMAZING  but at this point I was over it. She informed us they were trying a new system and I told her clearly this isn't working and we asked for the manager Justin and he was very indifferent and just merely nodded and walked away even though we pointed out the dirty tables and went floor leading to the restroom.  At that point it was evident that the problem started with management.

We waited for one to get clean, and then the server proceeded to help us and curse in front of us while taking our order. My margarita was terrible and 90% ice, I drank it in 5 mins.

THEN the food comes out COLD, and I ask for a beer and she says they only have 1 beer right now on tap. I said okay, and she just walks away without saying anything. This was the hugest waste of money I've ever spent. The servers don't even go back to the kitchen to get things, they just call into the kitchen on a walki talki.

Christian M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,13,4.0,4/26/2016,"I come here for the happy hour. The nachos are pretty damn good, every chip has  pretty equal amount of beans cheese with a choice of steak or chicken on it, topped with a slice of jalapeño. The bartenders are attentive and always nice. I really like this place for happy hour because of the prices and because it's so chill. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they don't have wifi. If they had wifi I'd be here more often but since they don't I always think twice about going there only because I know I'm not going to have any internet during the duration of my visit there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=100
Client C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,1,1.0,9/6/2016,"Let me start by saying I use to live in zip code 90302right down the street from this Chili's establishment. I have been at this Chili's location in Inglewood since they have opened being a member of the community since the mid-1990s. I am very dissatisfied with the lack of professionalism in the customer service area and also the quality of product that is brought into a minority community by big franchises. In the past I have gone to this establishment and have noticed how dirty the floors are and have stopped going to this establishment since around 2010. Now fast forward to today myself and someone that was joining me I will not disclose decided to have lunch at this Chili's in Inglewood right across the street where the new Rams stadium is being built. I was happy to find that the floors were very clean and the establishment look clean.  I figured it's lunchtime we'll sit down in the bar area. l wasn't greeted by anyone all the eye contact was made by the bartender and server female, no big deal. So we seat ourselves at the bar closest to the kitchen since that was the only full booth that was available at the time. Now mind you this is approximately 1:30 p.m. and there is not much of a crowd there happens to be female working the bar and a female server ----after about 15-20 minutes I was approached by the server asked if we wanted drinks, I ordered a beer my partner ordered mixed drink.  I pick my beer up from the bar because the bartender was having a communication error with the server since they were out of stock of a certain bottled beer . Instead of having to wait 10 or more minutes for a simple transaction I just went to the bar said I'll order this in replacement and I'm good to go. Now I don't know about you but it is rude for me to start sipping my beer when my partner is still waiting on their mixed drink so I communicate to the bartender that mixed drink you're making, is that ""such and such we ordered"" and bartender says"" yes"" ---I say okay that's our drink at this table.  For whatever reason they don't put a lemon in the drink, no big deal. I politely asked for some lemons I receive the lemons.  We ordered appetizers and the food was very good. The food was freshly prepared. Now this is where they lost me folks: just as we were thinking about ordering some food mind you the waitress did not come to our table to ask how our appetizers were or if we wanted to order entrees a gentleman comes from the kitchen and he's clearly starting his shift and he puts his hand he's in the middle of his crouch / bottom of his torso, where you can clearly see him under all of the flat screen TVs playing ESPN highlights This Server who started his shift puts his hands inside his crotch area zipper down, button off, belt unbuckled sticks his hand in his crotch and then starts to touch hisself again. Excuse me but is there not a restroom for employees to go and make adjustments wash your hands do what they need to do is it appropriate on the floor to stick your hand in your crotch as a server I'm sorry but I left with a tip you know I didn't want to seem like the type but I left for a minute it which was a 15% and I left and I'm out of there now the person I was with you may not have mind The Secret Snake sauce but I was cool and we actually had a heated conversation because that person was still hungry when they left although they're like are you just took me out here Order apps in a drink and we out of here but I just wanted to let you know is that appropriate for your gentlemen server to stick his hand in his crotch on the floor under the ESPN monitors and mind you you the words that came out of his mouth while he was ready to start his shift was"" how many servers called off today ---how many servers do we have today who's working the shift "" so I could clearly see that his mind mentally and his actions physically was not ready to be there. The only person that was helpful ( looked like Action Jackson / Carl Weathers--- and I could tell was overworked appear to be maybe an undercover LAPD officer or perhaps a security officer or perhaps the store manager the gentleman he was busting tables he was taking orders he was getting drinks she was getting condiments the bartender left the server was talking to some guy I don't know her boyfriend or something and then this other guy that was working like I said all he did was stick his hand in his Crouch like ---don't ask me for anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=100

Greg A.,"Gardena, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/3/2017,"Sunday night my wife and I decided on Chili's Ingelwood and we couldn't have made worse decision. We arrived at 5:15 p.m., as we entered there were two small parties seated in the waiting area, my wife asked the hostess what the wait time was and the hostess responded thirty minutes for the dinning area, she placed our name and then told myself of the wait time. We were both a little confused as we could see eight open tables within eyesight and several employees about, we decided to wait. After 10 minutes or so I noticed two open tables in the bar area and suggested we take a table as we could have a drink and either eat there or when our table in the main dinning area was ready we could move. As we entered the bar area to claim a table we noticed both tables had the previous parties dishes still on each table, not a problem we would take a table and wait for it to be cleaned and order a drink. We noticed right away there appeared to be one employee working behind the bar and one employee working the tables. We sat at the table for roughly twenty minutes and watched the waiterss working tables all around us, never once a word or even eye contact to acknowledge us. At this point my wife and I began to wonder if we were going to receive service let alone the table cleared. After serval more minutes we noticed the couple that was seated next to us stand up and the male said ""that's it we are out of hear"" that was when I realized they had been seated at their table prior to our arrival and their table had not been cleaned from the previous party as well or the waitress acknowledge them, they walked out. After another ten minutes and 0 (zero) customer service I asked my wife if our name was still on the waiting list, she said yes and we should be paged soon as it was at least thirty minutes sense she put us on the list, we decided to go back to the waiting area. The waiting area had filled up from when we had originally entered. The two couples that were in the waiting when we first entered were now standing at the reception desk looking rather irritated so my wife asked one of the parties if they were still waiting and he replied ""Yes, but we are leaving as they had been waiting almost an hour"" they did leave and shortly after the other party walked out as well. My wife went to the hostess and asked for an update on our wait and again she was told thirty minutes, my wife told the hostess we have told thirty minutes when we first put our name in, the hostess responded we our changing shift's and it will be thirty minutes. We decide to wait a little longer but after another twenty minutes my wife asked to speak to the manager. We are not sure if the employee ever told the manager of our request to speak with them as they never came out to speak with us. While we were waiting for the manager we watched several additional parties that had been waiting walk out. After another fifteen minutes waiting for the no show manager and we walked out as well. I can't tell you how their food was or even how their customer service was as the only thing we got from the staff after an hour in their establishment was ""thirty minutes"".   I do have one additional regret, as we were walking away I looked back into the bar window and over one hour from the time we entered Chili's that bar table still had the dirty dishes stacked on it. I regret not taking a picture of that table and posting it here. Don't waste your time...  I have never called a corporate office to complain but after the holiday I will be calling Chili's, hope the upper management responds a little quicker then their on site no show management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=100

My friend just had water and I ordered a Stone IPA and water. We received our waters quickly but I didn't get my beer until after our appetizer had been served. They didn't seem too busy so I was wondering what the hold up was. When my beer finally made it to the table it had a lime and a straw in it... I knew instantly (mainly because of color) that this was the wrong beer, and I was correct. I had instead been given Corona (definitely not Stone IPA). Our food came out fine, but It felt like we were inconveniencing our waitress if we asked for something.

After waiting a long time had to ask for our salads and then waited again.  Ask asking about our food a couple of times the food arrived cold and warm.  The Alfred sauce on the pasta was cold as if it had been poured from a jar and my burger was warm and the plate was hot.  The bun and Patti were dry and the lettuce wilted.  We shared the pasta because we were starving and left the burger untouched.   They still owe us the dessert we ordered, they will have to mail it because we are not going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=120

This time we sat in the bar area at one of the high chair tables. It has been the worst service ever. We got there around 2pm. Our waiter, Michael, greeted us and took our drink order, we waited for that for about 15 minutes. It took another 15 for him to come to take our lunch order. We waited for about another 30-40 minutes for our food, not once did our waiter come and say anything as to why our food was taking so long or even to apologize and say they were busy. Other people that got there after us but were waited on by another waitress were served before us. When our food finally came out, I went ahead and ordered a bowl just like mine to go, I figured if I order with enough time we shouldn't have to wait longer. Well since he would never come and check on us we had to wave him down to get our bill. At this time we were frustrated as to the time we had been waiting altogether so he just brought us the receipt of what he charged, we gave him a gift card and a credit card to charge the difference. We asked if the to go order was almost ready and he said yes, just to later find out after waiting another 10 minutes that he had not put the order through, he brought us another bill for the to go plate. After another 10 minutes we had had it and just walked out. I understand that there are very busy days and sometimes they are short staffed, however when the person waiting on you doesn't acknowledge the fact that you've waited so long it's just plain rude and irritating. And if you forgot to put the order through just admit it and apologize and don't keep telling us it'll be right out. He should consider another day job. Waiting tables isn't his calling. At least we weren't alone, a table behind us was having the same issues with trying to get him to come to their table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=120

Heather Z.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",135,183,102,4.0,2/22/2015,First time at a Chili's & it wasn't disappointing. If there's a wait time they ask you for a cell phone number so when your table is ready they text you so you can walk around the area if you don't feel like staying in the restaurant. Our waiter was really nice. We ordered to Arnold Palmers (mango & blackberry) & because it was taking a while to come out he brought us 2 strawberry ones to sip on. Always checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  Their chips & guac are good but those chips need to made thinner or something because every time you dipped it they would just crack into pieces !! My friend & her mom ordered the steak w/ mashed potatoes & mac n cheese & it was delicious ! Steak melted in your mouth & both sides were to die for ! I had their margarita chicken which comes with beans & cilantro lime rice. For a lighter fare menu item it was really good. Chicken could have been seasoned a little better but I still enjoyed it. Every table comes with a little tablet & if you're going to be paying by card you just pay on that ! You have the option of splitting it into 2 or 3 even ways but if you want to split it a different way just let the server know & they can adjust it for you. Tablet also has things to do while you're dining like playing 0.99 cent games !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=120

However, today I was trying to make a phone order for the company I work for and I was hung up on twice because the employee ultimately had no patience to get a large order in. It is uncalled for, unprofessional, and quite disturbing. This is a business and it should NOT be ran in such manner.

I think that this chilli's needs to work on making their food a bit faster so tarry don't put their waiters in a bad situation and get a low tip .

We sat on the bar area which was no waiting for a table. The table we sat at was dirty and the waitress walked by us 3 times before she cleaned the table. She took our order and never came back to check on us until we was almost done with our food. Mean while there was 2 white ladies sitting behind us and our waitress kept asking them if they needed anything else. Also, the setting area at the was nasty. The bartender was so nasty she was taking used napkins to cleaning the top of the bar. Instead of the bartender taking the dirty dishes and placing them under the bar, she was staking them on a table close to the bar. The server's appearances were awful.

I left before she did but with no soap how did she clean her hands properly? Changed my baby on a dirty changing table. Thank god I had a changing pad. Another overflowing trash can in view of dining room. Unfriendly greeter/seater 100% attitude and angry face. Did not say one word except my name when I told her we used the No Wait app.  Waiter took long to come, walked by and said ""don't trip, I'll get to you"" but I was not tripping.  He kept darting in and out so fast that we forgot what we needed. Long waits before seeing him Again. No automatic refill. Food came out in bits. Dish Machine broke so extra dishes took forever.

Nechae J.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,4,1,2.0,6/19/2014,"A few friends and I came here around 8:00 Sunday night... It was PACKED! I mean there were people waiting in the lobby, packed in the entrance, & waiting outside. We were told it would be a 40 to 50 minute wait before we could be seated, but one of the waitresses approached me and said he could get my friends and I a table near the bar now. (yay for being cute!) We totally skipped the line.  We all ordered the same thing - the fajita trio. I got mine without the shrimp. (I'm allergic) He gave us complimentary chips and salsa which I appreciated because I was starving!! I finished the chips within 5 minutes and about 20 minutes later we got our food.  The fajitas were OK. That's it. It came on a skillet yet everything was cold. The steak and chicken tasted like it was precooked and microwaved. Same for the rice and beans. I ordered my steak well done and of course it came medium rare. I was so hungry I ended up eating it anyway. (See attached pics) Our waitress was very friendly. He checked on us a few times regardless of it being busy. Though my food was cold and bland, I did tip my waitress for being so sweet.  Not sure if I'd return again. If I did, I definitely wouldn't purchase their microwaved fajitas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=160
Jones B.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,41,69,2.0,5/7/2015,"Despite the reviews here on Yelp, I truly, really wanted to give this place a second chance, because when it first opened a few years back, it truly was a great establishment in Inglewood. Sadly, to report that the place once again failed to live up to any glimmer of hope. We went on a cold/rainy Spring evening, and were assigned to our waiter, ""Mark Za"". I don't know if he's new, but he certainly is far too shy to be a waiter. When we asked what he'd recommend, it was more or less us going through the menu and getting a nod from him 'yay or nay'. On top of that, table service was rather atrocious -- Mark only came around, 4 times total (including the time he came around to take our food/drink order). I mentioned it was a cold/rainy evening because the restaurant seemed to be running at about 40% capacity-- So it wasn't full nor was it busy. For appetizers, we had the Chicken Nachos, Tableside Guac, and the standard ""salsa/chips"". Let me tell you, the best part was the Chicken Nachos. They were fresh, great tasting and the only thing to come out that kitchen that wasn't BURNED! The Tableside Guac was really bland. They bring you the guac on a plastic 'molcajete' and they do the Guac on the spot at your table. They need to add cilantro and certainly garlic salt. Without those two ingredients, Guac simply does not attain the taste everyone familiar with authentic Mexican Guac. That Guac stayed untouched by our party of four. For our main course, we ordered a Trio Mix/Match Fajitas (Steak/Chicken/Shrimp) and paid extra for the special rice/beans that was an optional add on, the Fresh Mix Pairing Trio (2 soft tacos/1 enchilada), Grilled Chicken Salad, and the Chipotle Fresh Mex Bowl with Grilled Chicken. (These are all pictured in the attached pics below.) It took us 25 minutes to get the Margaritas we ordered when we first sat down (Someone from the bar brought them over). It's saying a lot (about how slow service is) when we were all done with our lemonades before our appetizers came out. The appetizers I've already gone into detail previously, with the Chicken Nachos and salsa/chips being the highlight.  About 15 minutes after we got the appetizers, our waiter, Mark, was walking about when he looked over at me and realized we still didn't have our main course then signaled at me as though to say ""I got you"". 10 minutes after that, he came out with our plates. I should have known something was wrong when my Mix/Match Fajitas Trio was giving off a burned smell. You know when you over-cook something at home you can tell the difference between it being fully cooked and burned? Yeah, that's the smell that was coming from the Fajitas. Sure enough, it was so burned, that all the onions and bell peppers were stuck to the bottom of the cast iron plate they serve it in. Not only that, but the beef was very rubbery, which lets you know this isn't fresh meat, but rather par-cooked beef that is highly processed before it's served at your table. The picture of the shrimp on the menu showed medium-sized shrimp, the shrimp on the plate, as you can tell from the picture below, are small shrimp-- Certainly not what I thought I was getting when I ordered the dish. I left the plate alone after only eating the chicken, which is the only thing that didn't appear burned. I had to fetch Mark over and remind him that I paid extra for the rice and beans, to which he looked puzzled and instead of saying he would bring it right out, he said he would credit me for it on the bill-- If I ordered it, I want to at least taste it, not ordering for you to tell me what I can or can't consume.  I like how you can order other stuff from the little machines on each table-- I went ahead and ordered myself an appetizer of Smoked Wings (pictured). I don't know why I even bothered. Fool me once, shame on you, Fool me twice, shame on me. After I ordered the Smoked Wings, 20 minutes later, Mark came by the table to let me know that my order would be delayed because (these were his exact words): ""The cook burned your wings, so the kitchen manager is in there re-doing your order of wings"". Everyone in our table laughed hard, and all Mark could do was apologize for the delay. The wings finally came out and were good, but undercooked (as you can tell from the picture I uploaded - Wings should never be light yellow, especially not smoked wings.) I don't know what they put in the Pico de Gallo but it certainly wasn't your run-of-the-mill 'mild' PDG. It was extremely spicy, and we had to return the Grilled Chicken Salad due to the salad being flooded with pico de gallo throughout the entire salad, making it not edible. The Fresh Mix Pairing Trio was good as the person who had it said it tasted good, but the extra tortillas we ordered for it came out COLD! We put those tortillas on the side and left them alone. All in all, I have to give this place 2 stars. It just isn't what it once was. I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=160

That alone made my Chili's experience a memorable one!  I came to Chili's to test whether or not they can accommodate allergen-friendly eating... And guess what?! This chain restaurant is a dream come true for those suffering!!! Little tablets are located on every single table so you can look up specific menu items and whether or not they have allergens you cannot consume! And when you want to modify menu items, they TAKE NOTE (seriously) and accommodate your wishes without judgement!  I ordered the chicken fajitas, no sour cream, rice or tortillas... Or chipotle butter, and my entree came out EXACTLY the way I wanted it! And I know for a fact that it did because I'm not suffering from my food allergy/intolerance symptoms right now! SCORE! My friend ordered the same meal as me, except she didn't ditch the food allergens. She rated it a 2 out of 5 stars, where I rated mine a 3.... But honestly, I knew prior to coming to Chili's that the food wasn't going to be life changing... That being said, it wasn't disgusting either! The guacamole gets a 5 out of 5 stars for sure! My friend also ordered the Chicken Tortilla Soup, which apparently is a favorite among customers and she exclaimed that it was pretty tasty. Oh and it just so happened that Chili's was having a $5 Margarita special so of course THAT happened, but without even drinking it, I'm sure you can tell ME how good it was!

Erick D.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",23,36,16,1.0,2/17/2016,"This has been the worst service I have received at Chili's. It has been a while since I have visited a Chili's.  When we sat down it looks like they just started to slow down.  Our waitress came up to us and left the menu while introducing herself.  She then walked away. Usually they ask if we want something to drink but she did not ask. We decided to then just order all at once.  When we finally decided what we wanted the waiter was nowhere to be found. I kept searching for her but I did not see her. After 15 minutes of waiting she finally came out of the back.  We asked for an appetizer and our meals.  Our appetizer took about 15-20 minutes to come out. Luckily the appetizer was delicious so we did not mind. After that we were waiting about 30 minutes and we still have not received our food.  I was looking for our waiter again and again she was nowhere to be found.  I then saw a supervisor walking around and I asked him if he would check what was going on with our food. He said ""Sure I will check on it right now.""  He never came back.  20 minutes after that our waiter showed up saying here are these chips and salsa on us for the food taking so long. She said that the order she put in never went through but that it should be only a couple of minutes before it is out.  That was not true. We waited another 20 minutes and our food finally came out.  The food was terrible quality. The Mac and cheese felt like it had been sitting for a while. The steak felt really over cooked and the mashed potatoes did not taste like they usually taste.  Our waiter came over and asked if we wanted desert on her but at that point we just wanted to leave.  Overall we felt like our waiter was not tending to us like she should have been.  Our food took way to long to get to our table.  The food also did not taste good.  We were there for about 2 and a half hours and not once did we feel like our time was worth it.  The free chips and salsa and desert was a nice gesture but that does not excuse the fact that we were basically forgotten.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=180
Ryan P.,"Seal Beach, CA",167,1402,21379,1.0,1/6/2014,"Don't be silly and eat at this CHILI'S Are you FRICKIN kidding me?  Here we go again with me having to put you on BLAST!  There REALLY needs to be a NEGATIVE rating on YELP! Let's start with the reason I was in dreaded LA in the first place and then it only got worse from there!  There is a reason they call it a blind date.  For one you don't know the person and two you don't know how good or bad it is going to be!  The fact that he picked this place to go and not some place in the middle between the two of us was strike one and two.  So we were NOT off to a good start! This place was packed I am guessing because of the game!  I drive up and my first sighting was of  a motorcycles blaring music like he was at some Slick Rick concert!  The sounds of... Uncle Ricky, could u read us a bed time story please, o please (Alright you kids get to bed I'll get the story book. Yall tucked in?)yea Here we go, Once upon a time not long ago... So needless to say I had the chance to join the concert while still inside my own car!  My heart was even invited as I could feel it vibrating in my chest to the bass in the song!  Toto we I not in the OC anymore! So I meet him out front!  A word of advice to women ...""DO NOT LET STRANGERS PICK YOU UP FROM HOME.  MEET THEM IN YOUR OWN CAR SO YOU CAN HAVE AN ESCAPE VEHICLE IF NEEDED!""  So we walk in and he wants to sit in the bar area not a table where we can try and talk and get to know one another!  Strike three!  Really, really, are you FRICKIN KIDDING ME!  And now I am RET-2-GO (leave)! So he finds a seat at a DIRTY, NASTY TABLE!  NOT one server is remotely trying to CLEAN off a table because they are nowhere to be found!  What the H*LL was I thinking agreeing to go on a blind date in the first place!  I'm gonna kill my friend when I see her!  He may be nice at work but this FOOL has ABSO-FRICKIN-LUTLY NO CLASS at all or knows where to find it!  On I forgot to mention he was dressed like he was going to work out!  Sweats, tennis and a sudo-sweatshirt.  WHAT the H*LL!  You can't even bother to try to look decent!  I'm in-a NIGHTMARE...this is my NIGHTMARE! About 15 to 20 minutes passed by before I even saw anyone to ask to clean off the table!  Finally I was able to wave my hands wildly enough to get someone to take off the plates but they left the used glasses!  What did they somehow think I wanted to drink what was in the glass!  Another 5 to 6 mins and Mr Ghetto Fabulous flags down one of his homies that works there to clear off the rest of the table but he didn't bother to pretend like he was going to wipe it down!   I am sitting with my arms folded as to not accidentally put them on the table!  Finally after about another 20 minutes someone comes over to take our drink orders.  I got water with lemon no ice!  Pretty easy right!  So why did I get ice in my glass?  I needed something stronger but I also NEEDED to be alert and on guard to dart out the front door and to the safety of my car if need be! Finally our food orders were taken and I stuck with a salad!  I figure I needed to end this DATE from H*LL ASAP!  How hard or long could it take to put lettuce on the plate and grill up some chicken!  And he ordered soup!  I wanted to stab myself in the eye with a hot poker!  I'm SURE I would have enjoyed that more than his company!  While we waited we sort of chatted!  Limited vocabulary on his part!  I don't think there was one sentence without the 'F' word!  Hey I'm no prude but REALLY!  You can't express yourself WITHOUT using that word!  I was ACTUALLY thankful for the SAINTS GAME that was on!  My beloved SAINTS that WON by the way, kept me from going INSANE! Our food finally arrived and I tried to scarf it down so I could leave!  It wasn't good or bad it was bunny food NOT even field greens or spinach!  The lettuce was wilted and the chicken was dry tasteless!  How can you mess up with lettuce and chicken?  I was SUPER HAPPY when I was done and he asked for the check!  I could NOT get out of there quicker!  When he did speak he seemed more interested in what was in my underwear than if I had a brain and he kept leaning into me on my side of the table!  I think I threw up a lil in my mouth...EPIC FAIL!  LOOSER!  This was MOST certainly the DATE from H*LL!   I'm sure you can GUESS THAT I WILL NEVER BE BACK!  Between the CRAPPY service and the food not being all that great!  I was SUPER glad to be back home on the other side of the orange curtain!  I had a drink and a shower to wash off the bad date and LA...WHY ME?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=180

We were seated and greeted promptly by our waitress but it took a long time to get our drinks and appetizers. We ordered 2 appetizers, the Chips and Queso and the Texas Cheese Fries. The chips and cheese fries came out together then 1 hour later the queso arrived with 4 out of 5 of the main dishes. The 5th dish arrived 30 mins later due to the Kitchen burning the 1st. After we finished our meal we ordered the Molten Chocolate Lava Dessert. We were informed that the Kitchen was out of ice cream and the manager went across the street to Target to buy ice cream. We waited about 30mins for our dessert; the chocolate cake was cold, the ice cream was not a full scoop and there was no chocolate shell on the top as advertised, I have pictures for proof. We also heard the table of 6 next to us had the same issue. In all, our experience started at 7:35pm we did not leave until almost 10:00pm, which can be referenced on our receipt, due to all the issues at the Inglewood location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=180

Will H.,"Corona, CA",16,211,,3.0,10/21/2014,"Came in to redeem my Birthday Dessert coupon and pig out on the Molten Chocolate Lava cake a la mode, which is the best in the world (even better than what is offered at Flemings steak house at double the cost). For my entrée, I opted for the super yummy Cajun chicken pasta Alfredo, which is always good here, but could use a little more sauce to be sopped up with the garlic toast. Service was excellent by friendly  server Lucy.... The main reasons for the 2-star deduction from a perfect visit are as follows: 1.  My garlic toast came as my dessert after I was 100% done with my meal. How is it that the chefs can't get a piece on the plate when the pasta comes out....or at least a couple of minutes later?  No excuses. 2.  The entire inside front page of the menu where the cocktails and assorted beverages are listed has NO PRICING.  WHY?  Customers today want 100% transparency in prices for all items they will be buying.  I WANT to know if my milk  or Coke is $1.50 or $3.00 and if my Cocktail is $5 or $10....By hiding this info from the customer it is just a major way to squeeze more dollars out of each of us without us knowing until it is too late and the bill arrives.  What is very, very sad, as this deceptive practice has now become the norm at at least 80% of the restaurants I visit.....Looks like someone wrote an article in a trade journal about how to bring more money to the bottom line and the chain owners/managers read the info and decided it was a GREAT IDEA.....NOT!! 3. Nice color photos and promo menus for the NEW Craft burgers (which look very yummy), but there is NO indication as to their SIZE (quarter, third or half pound??).  Why?  That is a very important fact and even the servers are clueless, as that info has not been passed along to them. Same goes for the steaks:  the sirloin says it is CHOICE grade but the Ribeye listed next to it has no mention of the meat grade.  Is it also CHOICE or SELECT.  The customers want to know this simple info.  Servers have no idea either and don't know that meat even comes in 3 major grades:  Select (the nasty stuff you get at most grocery stores), Choice which is a middle grade and O.K., and PRIME, which is what you usually get at higher end steak houses like Flemings, Morton's and Ruth's Chris.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=180

Rey L.,"El Segundo, CA",119,851,1991,4.0,2/16/2012,"i liked this place. obviously, it's a chain and the food is ubiquitous. the only thing to really gauge is price and service. price: we took the lunch combo special. mama had some salad thing with soup, i had the mini burger thing with the potato soup, and our buddy had the enchilada with the potato soup too. no more than $7 for each of items. that lunch combo is an amazing deal. there is really a lot of food on the plate. plus it includes fries. oh, and sofi had the pizza and tangerines with choco milk. 1 beer, 2 ice teas added, came up to less than $40 for 3.5 people. pretty cool. service: i had some hesitation visiting this specific location due to previous reviews. however, i was pleasantly surprised by our server and the service. she was a really sweet lady. on top of us as soon as we sat down and pretty much at our beck and call. drinks and food came in a timely manner, 8 mins from ordering to gorging. great service. overall, a nice lunch and if ever we're in the area, we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=240
Fernando C.,"Culver City, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/1/2015,"My family and I ate here today and the food was okay, just a little bland, and the service was terrible. Our waitress, who didn't give her name, constantly left our table to attend to tables that had already gotten their food. When she finally served us it took ten minutes for her to input our order and another 45 to get our food. The soda was mostly water and the Crispy Chicken Crispers I ordered weren't crispy, as the name would have you believe, and we're overpowered by the BBQ. The ice in my drink made up most of the space in the mug I was drinking from, so I easily ran out. Going back to the waitress, she hardly cared about our experience, not even asking us for a refill. This our 3rd time visiting Chili's, all of which were terribly failures, so needless to say, we won't be visiting for a very long time, or until the other Yelp reviews prove me wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=240

I don't like it when I have to scream at someone to ask them how their meal is when they're sitting next to me haha. Other than that the rest of my experience was so awesome. Came in for a late night dinner with a friend a couple weeks ago when I was in the area. We ended up sitting at the bar because there were no booths open but *shrugs* I don't care. Bartenders were nice and efficient despite being really busy on a Thursday night and possibly short staffed? Props to those ladies because they didn't even break a sweat. Despite being really busy, these girls did not let it get in the way of their customer's experience.  Beers took a while to get out but it was something about the mugs and not our server.  I got a classic bacon burger but substituted the beef patty with a turkey patty. I can't tell if it was because I was pretty lit (drank my beer on an empty stomach :( ) or if it was just that good. Seriously one of the tastiest burgers I've had.. And I've had a lot of burgers haha. I wouldn't compare it to innout but it was satisfying. Perfect amount of food. My friend's steak was also cooked to perfection, too. We left very happy!  I used to go to Chili's all the time but haven't been since 2009 (My hs sweetheart and I went to Chili's every Friday for date night) BUT we broke up and I avoided this place like the plague... until now!

Samantha C.,"South River, NJ",1,25,4,1.0,10/26/2013,"I wish there was a no-star rating. At around 7pm, my boyfriend and I were shopping in the Best Buy in the parking lot of this Chili's. We decided that was going to be our dinner so I called when we started shopping. It rang about 7 times, asked if I wanted to be transfered to the host. It then rang another 7 times, same message. I hung up, tried again. Same thing. I wasn't really paying attention to how many times I called because we were shopping. Finally, 15 minutes and 12 phone calls later, I realize it and get pissed. My boyfriend starts calling. 5 minutes later he finally gets someone and he hands me the phone. I had no idea if I was on the To-Go line or the host line, so I said ""Hi, I've been trying to call to place a to-go order?"" The guy on the other end, very snarkily replied ""Yeah, and?"" I was caught of guard and asked if I was on the to-go line or not. His reply? ""Uh, yeah. Why do you think I'm asking? What do you want?"" I was quiet for a second because I've gone here a few times and never had that rude of service. He then rudely snipped ""Are you going to order?"" So I placed my order and he told me 13 minutes. Not 10, not 15. 13.  So we paid for out stuff and headed over, getting there at the 15 minute mark. We then waited another 5 minutes while ringing the bell for someone to acknowledge us. The girl who got our food was very sweet and got the food quickly, which was nice. We got home and opened the orders. I ordered a bacon burger with just ketchup and pickles. Well, that didn't happen as it had everything on it. I then checked the queso dip and they filled it half-way if that.  Needless to say, 50 minutes, 20 of them being a ringtone, for wrong and pitiful food is not a good way to get customers to come back.

Lady S.,"Culver City, CA",30,33,17,1.0,1/24/2016,"This used to be a great place to eat, service and menu choices were awesome. I've visited twice this month just to see if I went on an off night but no this restaurant is just off. Each visit took forever just to get drinks and chips/salsa which used to grace every table upon sitting, now you order it and it may take 15-20 mins just to arrive or show up at the same time as yr meal. The server forgot about my table once the food was served. Never bought napkins, and took forever to refill a drink so I cancelled the refill last time, bought utensils for one person in a party of two, Nvr refilled the endless chips also and after keeping me waiting for one type of drink for 15 mins she returned to tell me they were out of ingredients needed to make it so I had to get something different. I think this might just be my last visit at this particular location. Food taste good when it finally shows up but the poor service and long wait for EVERYTHING is just not worth the frustration.

The artichoke dip also amazing. Grilled chicken sandwich with avocado and bacon was so flavorful! Lots of good feedback on the mango tilapia, sliders, and trio fajitas!

I generously gave this Chili's location 2 stars only because the locations is clean, typical nice chain atmosphere, the menu selection is decent, and the salad I had was pretty tasty. However, if I had to rate this location on quality of service I would have given it 1 star.  My friend and I waited about 15 minutes to be seated on a busy Saturday night. Then once seated we waited another 30 minutes before my friend finally got up and walked up to a group of waiters chatting and asked if someone could help us. One waiter apologized profusely and volunteered to assist us. Then we waited another 30 minutes for our order to arrive. When our food finally came they got my friend's order wrong. So we sat another 15 minutes waiting for them to correct his order.

Ordered online and went to pick it up. Understandably, the restaurant was crowded due to the football game that was on. No one was at the pick up counter but a waitress did pass me a couple of times. On the third pass the young waitress asks, ""whats the name on the order BABY?"" Now, being called baby clearly threw me and obviously showed on my face because of the sarcastic look the waitress gave me. I asked for a manager and was directed to Mr. Newell. He stated that the waitress had already told him what happened. I asked what that may have been and he stated the waitress said I was upset because she called me ""baby"". My question is why didn't he address me immediately? Anyway, he apologized as managers are supposed to. While waiting for my order, this waitress passed between me and another customer, closer to me, and did not say excuse me or anything either time. A security officer passed between us and said excuse me. She also had the sarcastic, immature laugh each time she passed. I shouldn't be infuriated on a trip to pick up food.

Chicken strips or whatever they are called here and the chicken fajitas w the guac and chips. We wanted Mac and cheese too so we got a side of that. Guac was prob the best thing I ate but wasn't amazing at all. The chicken was disgusting. Like frozen and microwaved....chewy and just not good at all....thrown w some frozen onions and peppers. Even the flour tortillas were nasty I don't even know how. I usually eat all my food because I hate wasting food but after the second taco I made w the fajitas I had to stop. My friend said the chicken strips weren't good. I had a piece and they were whatever to me but I feel like its hard to mess up fried food. The Mac and cheese came out after the main food. It looked worst than Kraft....soupy w some random bread crumbs thrown on top. It tasted worst than Kraft and was cold. Got it taken off our check and sent back.

We were seated and didn't have our drinks ordered until 15 minutes after. No waiter stopped by or said we will be with you soon, absolutely nothing. A waitress was kind enough to stop and ask us if we had ordered yet. She took our order. Our drinks arrived. Meanwhile we were given chips and salsa on the house due to the inconvenience. After ordering, it took 20 minutes for appetizers that came with the 2 for $20. My moms and sister appetizer arrived but mine didn't. I waited and just hoped it was a mistake. I complained and asked for the manager 3 times before he arrived. He was confused as to why my chips and guacamole hadn't arrived because it ""takes 30 seconds"". I waited 7 minutes for my guac and chips. Then, our food or should I say their food arrives. My food had to have fallen off the radar because it didn't come. I waited 15 minutes until everyone was finished eating to receive my food. When I did receive it, my steak was burnt and I couldn't stand to stomach it. The manager insulted me by saying ""well didn't you ask for well done"" as if I could not recognize a burnt steak. I sent it back and didn't even ask for another. My sisters' fajitas were burnt and disgusting. They are seriously lacking. I have been here since 4:12 pm and I didn't leave until 6:00 pm. They had a whole staff on duty and none were attentive to our needs. The check was wrong. Everything is wrong. I am just so agitated with this restaurant and everyone except our waitress and she wasn't even supposed to be our waitress. Her name was Lashondra and she was very apologetic and gave her best effort to undo the damage. Unfortunately, there was not much she could do. I will not be returning to this chilis although it was my usual spot for quick lunch or dinner with my sisters and mom. I don't like the way the situation was handled. I had to call for the manager multiple times. He was not very attentive or apologetic.

That being said, be ready for the level and amount of uncouthness (if thats a word) that occurs at this location.  The first time I came here several years ago when it opened, from walking in the door to storming out, I was there an hour and had all of three stale chips and water in my belly. Second time I was chased down in the parking lot because I left after refusing to pay for my meal that was incorrect three times in a row and they tried to say I was running out on the bill. I am a vegetarian and meat was repeatedly put in my dish, and after a manager came by who basically told me I should not come to Chilis if I dont eat meat, I walked da f*k out. Third time was smooth service. Now all three of those were a while back with various company.  During the playoffs I attempted to go here because it was convenient and down the street. It was ridiculously packed and with the expectation that service was going to be delayed and crazy, the experience was mediocre. Recently I went there a couple Fridays ago and sat at the bar.  The people at the bar were extremely friendly and ended up having a great time. It helped that they apparently were regulars and knew the bartender, so I was getting strong drinks, excellent service and an absolutely wonderful experience. Essentially, it is hit or miss. Go in knowing service is going to be mediocre at best, customers are vocal, so speak up or keep ya head down.  Other than that, order it to go because it is the same Chili's menu, if u dont want the other added stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=320

The waitress sat down next to me and grabbed the menu. She kept asking questions like "" so no Pico de gallo?"" Or no saut?"" I didn't know what saut meant so I assumed it was either salt or sauce. I finally guessed it was salt and said yes. Then another waiter came and asked our waiter if I wanted sauce. I quickly told her that I didn't want sauce because I had figured out that saut meant sauce. When the waiter brought it an hour, it just had chicken. She asked if it was missing anything and I said that the lettuce and cheese were missing. She left and came back with uncooked mozzarella cheese. She asked if anything was missing again and I told her that the lettuce was. She came back with coleslaw which has nothing to do with lettuce.

This location was okay -- not outstanding, but not awful either.  I ordered the Express Lunch which comes with soup, salad, and chips & salsa.  The latter is to die for -- the salsa spicy with just the right amount of chunks, and the chips greasy yet crisp. I opted for the Sweet Corn soup, being a pescetarian, and it wasn't as warm as I'd like it to be.  I was starving and didn't want to wait for them to heat it up, so I lapped it up anyway. The salad was a salad -- nothing too memorable there.  But I did eat it with their honey mustard dressing, which is one of the best out there! I was displeased with the cleanliness of the facility.  It wasn't busy at all while my party was there, so I don't see why someone couldn't have noticed the chewed-up chicken bone on the floor near our table.  Also, I didn't use the restroom but someone I was with said it was disgusting. I was also annoyed with the lack of happy hour specials in the dining area.  There were signs everywhere for happy hour, but once we were settled into our seats, we were told the specials were only available at the bar.  We ended up not buying drinks, because why go full-price if I don't have to?

Sunshine P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",12,88,16,1.0,3/23/2013,"I use to like this place and frequent it many times with my friends BUT, the last time I went (yesterday) was Happy Hour and Karen was bartending. Any other time, I had no issues with her AND when I'm satisfied with service, I tip VERY well but the last two times, and especially this one,. her attitude was HORRIBLE and people at the bar were noticing this also. The lady next to me said that her and her husband will start goin to the Chilis in LAkewood where they can get better service because Karens auora/attitude was FOUL, my friends, the people to the left of me, and a couple across the bar were talking about it also. So NO, I didnt tip her because of her attitude and when she looked at my credit card receipt and it said ""$0"" in the TIP section, her eyes got HUGE and she said ""oh really?""- I looked at her and said ""REALLY"". Thanks Karen for saving me money that I work so hard for. You've lost a total of 8 customers in one night and people talk, so with that said, you might want to get your attitude tuned up because all you're doing is putting more money in shelleys pocket. Shes a better bartender anyways with a VIBRANT personality. I dont mind tipping HER $20 for her service. And the next time you say ""These customers are getting on my nerves"" make sure you use your LIBRARY VOICE because people heard you, and you'll never know when one of 'these customers' is a Secret Shopper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=340

She came tool put drink orders then took another 25 minutes to bring them and take our order ! After that the fire alarm went off for like 10 minutes and I have a two year old toddler with me so the fire alarm was driving me crazy that shit kept ringing for like 10 minutes straight finally went off people started clapping , then the waiter came and brought us our appetizer that tasted like it had been sitting there to be brought to us uhggg! Then I got a chicken avocado sandwich tasted horrible ! No taste no flavor I was smothering it in honey mustard to get flavor I'm so upset with this chilis made me not want chilis anymore and sadly they mango tea drink tasted more like tea no mango in it so so upset do not recommend coming here at all !!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=340

My experience was ok.  We had to wait for a few minutes, but were seated soon, thereafter.  The appetizers were good enough.  But, one of the waitresses had a weird attitude, don't know what that's all about.  Except for that one, the other waiters were pretty cool.  The entrees were good enough, I mean this isn't P.F. Changs or Cheesecake Factory, what do you expect, lol!  The only thing I didn't appreciate was how other customers treated the waiters.  The customers can be really demanding at this particular location and sometimes they have stuffy attitudes of their own.  Then, it doesn't help when the waiters respond negatively.  It just makes the experience daunting for other patrons who are witnessing this whackness.  When I go out to eat, I am looking to relax and have fun, not to witness wanna-be bourgeois treat people like they are mere servants.  Come people, where's the manners?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=360
Rocky T.,"Glendale, CA",28,50,3,1.0,4/24/2014,"On 4/23/14 dined at this location and it was one of the most unpleasant experiences ever. The food was not the worst, although my pasta was over cooked but the real issue was the service. Our server came to our table to take the order and drop off the bill. Fortunately, the food was delivered by another employee, otherwise, we would still be waiting... The server never returned to check on us or refill tea or water. Never inquired about the food and when asked for napkins let us know by his demeanor and attitude it was an imposition. Perhaps, the servers should be put on notice that the customers pay their salary and keep them working; a point that should be driven home with a vengeance by the Managing Partner, Jose Villareal and Chili's Corporate Management. Unfortunately, I will now be apprehensive about dining at any Chili's Restaurants in the future.

It was never about the freebies... I love Chili's and I think the money I spend on Chili's is worth it to me because I don't cook...

I don't even eat the appetizers at Chili's, but its the principal and so for that... the managers there are GHETTO , RUDE and LIARS.

I've always been a fan of fine dining and chilis is an expert of making me feel like I'm living the fancy life while also wearing sweatpants.  Today, I thought I'd visit the chilis is Inglewood, CA. Before eating there I had heard that this chilis is the 3rd most popular chilis in America... yeah ok, we'll see about that.. So I walked in and as an experienced yelp reviewer I asked to see the manager right away to let him know that I am a food critic (on yelp) and that he better treat me nicely or he can expect a one star on yelp (I'm not afraid to ruin someone's business!!) Unfortunately, the employees said that the manager isn't available and has been hiding out in the back room for the whole day.. So naturally I decided to investigate... I entered the back room only to find the manager camping out in the back playing clash royale!!! He said that it was an urgent matter because the clan chest needed to filled up I then showed him my deck in clash royale and he gave me some great tips on how to improve my game The manager then said I can just eat my meal with him in the back room and we can play clash royale and of course I accepted. I ordered the Santa Fe chicken quesadillas which apparently aren't on the menu anymore but he said  he can make one anyway. (What a guy!) He let me join his clan called ""That's cool"" and it's a pretty good clan.

However the few staff who are attentive and caring are easily overshadowed by the unruly majority of the clientele.   It is extremely loud in this bar section. The environment on this side is extremely disorganized and unbelievably harsh on the ears.  A busy day is understandable. The inability of the staff to address the issues: 1)  Unruly behavior, due to alcohol, being tolerated.  2) Absolute indifference to the rest of the clienteles level of overall satisfaction.   3) The visibility of the TV completely blocked due to the absurd number of people standing and yelling without any regard to the people around.  This is just unacceptable.  Your location currently holds a 2 1/2 star rating in Yelp. This rating, in my opinion, is beyond nice. It is maybe a rating of pity.

Jeremy X.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,14,,1.0,10/13/2016,"If I could give negative stars I would, my sons family birthday dinner was ruined last night at this poorly run joke of an establishment.  It was my sons 17th birthday and he picked Chilli's and boy was that a mistake.  Every possible thing that could go wrong went wrong.  When we ordered our food and drinks we sat there for over 20 minutes and had to ask 3 times about just receiving our drinks or even just water.  The appetizers finally came out before the drinks and they didn't even bring us plates, napkins or silverware for the appetizers.  Finally half of our drinks came and we still had to ask for the 2 margaritas, coffee for my father in law, and sodas for some of the kids and then just requested if they could bring more waters in the meantime since we had finished the appetizers.  So we finished our appetizers without getting any napkins or silverware or plates.  After asking 2 different servers passing by I decided to go to the restroom and I grabbed the paper towels from the bathroom so we could at least clean our hands.  Finally my father in law got his coffee but we couldn't get sugar or creamer so he drank his coffee black. My sister in law got her margarita but it was nothing like the picture, it didn't have the berries in it, the salted rim or the pineapple wedge, nor was it served in a margarita glass but it was the right color at least, my wife received a margarita but it was a flavored one and not a plain one on the rocks.  When our dinners arrived after about an hour and 15 minutes wait, and mind you, it was not very busy, at all, the server said watch out hot plate coming through with fajitas.  The fajitas were not sizzling and they we're actually cold and you could grab the skillet by the handle, so no sir they actually were cold non sizzling fajitas on a cold plate, so how long were they sitting there? Anyways I was so hungry so I ate them.  My friend sitting next to me didn't even get the fixings for his fajitas so he asked for them but by the time the rice beans and sides came for his fajitas, my friend had eaten everything and had no need for the sides anymore. When all the plates were delivered to the table, my sister in law asked where her food was.  Server asked what she ordered and she said the fish tacos, the server replied oh we don't have fish tacos.  So why didn't he say that at the start of the order.  So of course by the time she got her steak tacos everyone at the table was done with all their food.  My wife asked for limes for her tacos several times and what do you know, those limes were never seen.  My friend and my brother in law asked for refills and they grabbed our glasses and then never came back so I guess no refills.  I actually shared the silverware with my brother in law, because we didn't get enough silverware for everyone. So I shared his fork to make my fajitas tacos and then I would pass the fork back to my brother in law so he could eat his burnt to hell steal that was supposed to come out medium rare. We also needed tortillas for the fajitas and after I myself needed a refill and tortillas, I decided to get up and get them myself since our servers were incapable of simple requests.  I went to the side entrance of kitchen and asked for my tortillas and then received them, then I took a couple of our lemonades to the bar and got the refills there, then retuned back to the table. So we said we were there to celebrate our sons birthday and they never came and did the happy birthday song.  We sent the kids meanwhile to cold stone which was best decision of the night, so while we waited for bull or manager or anyone, the kids had time to go to cold stone and got ice cream and finished it and returned back to chillis and then we waited.  I also had a coupon for free kids meal that was emailed to us and I ordered the cheeseburger sliders for my baby girl and those never came, yet when we got the bill there was all sorts of charges on it that we didn't get, we had 2 margaritas yet they charged us for 3, they charged us for the sliders which we didn't receive which I had a coupon for, the sides for the fajitas which came late, they charged us for a queso dip which we never received, and they charged us for blackberry tea which we didn't receive and table entertainment which we didn't use either, we did look at the table screens to figure out our bill and to discover these horrendous overcharges.  So after not receiving all our food orders, appetizers, drinks and getting cold food and no birthday song and overcharging us on our bill, the manager came back and told us that she took care of the items we didn't receive, so wow we actually got free steak tacos for my sister in law that received her tacos when everyone was done.  WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE AND SONS BDAY DINNER RUINED!!!!  2 1/2 hours of my life I won't get back, so safe to say I will never go to a chillis ever, and I used to go once every other month and never was treated like this!  Zero stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-inglewood?start=140
