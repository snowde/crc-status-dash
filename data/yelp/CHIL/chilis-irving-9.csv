Lorna M.,"Irving, TX",41,8,1,3.0,11/5/2017,Food was okay as usual. They have been advertising about bigger ribs and burgers but my ribs were still small ( looked smaller),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9
Courtney V.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/13/2017,"If I could, I would give zero stars. This place makes me want to never eat at any Chili's ever again, and I won't. Angela Fox, I would highly suggest you train your staff before your restaurant loses business and shuts down for good because I see it going in that direction if my experience is anything to go by.  My family and I just had dinner here. We're not super picky or finicky but the service here was just horrendous. Right off the bat, we were seated at a booth where the seats were wet, which made my pants damp. I got up and my sister asked our host if we could have some napkins. Rather than offering to wipe down the seats for us or getting a server to come with a dry towel, the host named Jason, gave my sister a single napkin. You heard that our seats were wet and so was our table. What were You expecting us to do with one napkin, Jason??? So my sister asked if we could have a few more, and he sarcastically grabbed a large stack and asked, ""Is this enough?"" Okay, whatever. We let that go. There was food on the ground which my sister tried not to step on.  Our server (I didn't get a name) took our orders and brought our food but never once returned to our table to offer refills or napkins. It's not like the restaurant was full. Where did he go? Why didn't he bother to check on us at least once when we needed napkins and got to the end of our meals with empty cups?  Maybe we should read the reviews on here before dining. Angela Fox, I got your name off of the door where you're listed as the General Manager. Please take these reviews seriously. Train your staff and have them clean up the place. I'm very surprised that nothing has changed because it seems like others on here have had a similar experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9

Gail O.,"Irving, TX",15,143,1132,3.0,10/10/2015,"Not sure if I care for the interior, but it appears to be more accommodating to larger parties.   With a party of 2, we find ourselves eating in the bar area more than the restaurant ...you'll get a table faster.   The food is good.  Their menu continues to grow which can become overwhelming to customers.  And when they add new items to their menu, you that either take off your favorites or don't include them in specials. Their wait staff is hit-or-miss when it comes to service.  You can place orders and pay for your food via their table top computers.

Tired of depending on someone to release me into the public.. after waiting for someone to bring a lousy refill or just shut up and do your job.

Maricel J.,"Euless, TX",15,35,66,3.0,2/19/2017,We were seated immediately. The service was good. She gave us extra napkins which is always a plus for me and refilled drinks without being asked. We ordered an appetizer which took forever. I was hoping it would not come with our entrees but it did. It defeats the purpose of munching on something while waiting.  The food was average.

Steffanie B.,"New York, NY",249,339,75,2.0,2/12/2015,"I stopped in for a to go meal. We made the order at the bar which was probably a mistake, should've went to the window labeled TO Go. It took forever to get our food and of course, it was all room temperature upon arrival.  Hmm,  I wonder how long our food was sitting in the window ready? This obviously effects the flavor. Even blah food can make it if it's hot and you're hungry as hell, as I was tonight.   I ordered chicken fajitas, cadillac style. Where do I begin. Chicken was minimally flavored. Rice was hard, seemingly undercooked. Despite awesome sounding fixings - pickled jalapenos,  guacamole,  sour cream, salsa, Pico de Gallo - my fajitas proved significantly underwhelming. I only scared them because I had entered into a hunger - induced irritability. My other plate on the ticket was a triple dipper consisting of chicken crispers, sw egg rolls and big mouth bites. All room temperature damn near reverting to its frozen taste. The bartender was overwhelmed by the drink orders coming in though she was decent enough. For $30, it reaffirmed why I don't really ever eat at Chili's. It's been years since I've been there and looking at their new menu I was impressed but my food told the tale. Maybe dining in would've proven a different experience.  Ah well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9

Ricardo A.,"Dallas, TX",16,43,69,1.0,5/18/2015,"I just returned from a thoroughly unsatisfying lunch experience. I decided to split the 2 for $20 deal with a coworker since there were a few of the ""lighter options"" on the 2 for 20 menu. Tried the Mango chile tilapia which was somewhat salty but otherwise okay.  I paid $1 more for the fresco salad and that was disappointing. for my second side i chose broccoli which was the best part of the meal.  The other entree was the 6 ounce sirloin - absolutely terrible. Extremely salty and almost completely gristle. The other person who ordered it tried to cut around the gristle but gave up since there was no actual meat within. So we switched. Officially the worst piece of meat I have ever eaten. They also had the beans - extremely salty. We ordered the guacamole as the appetizer. If you are betting I will say salty then you would be 100% correct.  For $27 with tax and tip it is safe to say that I will be avoiding chili's in the foreseeable future. For that amount I can have way better food in Irving (Andalous or Kebabs to Go just to name a few). I just have to write this review down so that next time when someone suggests Chili's I can glance at this and say...I'll pass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9

Gracie G.,"Irving, TX",76,10,3,4.0,12/23/2015,"I have been to this Chili's twice very recently and I have to say, the staff is so positive and friendly, it makes me want to come back! I was particularly impressed with our waitress, Brandi; she was very upbeat and had just the right balance of not interrupting our conversation but being around enough to be helpful. Thanks to the waiters and waitresses, this Chili's is a really happy place.  The quality of the food is also quite good; you always know you'll be happy with what you get. The reason I didn't put 5 stars is because I think in general, Chili's has really gone up in their prices - It used to be affordable (but not trashy) family dining. Now it's quite expensive! I went to lunch by myself and paid $17 for a pasta plate and a soda. :( That being said - You get what you pay for, in a good way - Very friendly, accommodating staff & satisfying food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9

This Chili's menu has so many options, I was very pleased. However, what I wanted wasn't on the 2 for $20 and thought I could make a substitution.    I brought this up to our waitress who rudely said,""No we don't do that"" in the same rude/monotone voice she greeted us in. (Note: the restaurant was noisy and our waitress was very tall). It would probably be a good idea for her to bend down if she couldn't hear.

Christopher D.,"Richardson, TX",59,35,18,3.0,7/25/2014,My husband and I agree that this location deserves three stars. Tables and Booths were all dirty. New ziosk machines and salt & pepper shakers  also sticky and dirty. Tables not pre-set with silverware for lunch crowd. We got there at 11 and were originally sat in a closed section. Server was hurried and somewhat friendly. Food was good. We had a voucher and needed to pay our server but had been told to use the new machine. However it's not equipped with the ability to accept it. We waited almost 5 minutes for someone to return but just ended up grabbing a manager. He was fabulous. Very friendly and helpful.

Stacy M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",48,63,60,1.0,2/7/2015,"I came in for dinner tonight for a party of two. The hostess informed me the bar was open seating, as they are at all Chili's locations. However, when I asked her to have a server bus the dishes off an open table, the hostess refused and said it wasn't her job, and a server would do it when they get around to it. Since there was no sense of urgency I proceeded to put my things down anyway and waved at the bar server for assistance. Before I could even sit, a different hostess stopped me and said she could not seat us unless the table was cleared, and she would get fired if she allowed it. Excuse me, but didn't the other hostess say the bar was open seating? Because of their incompetence, I literally picked up my things and walked right out. A note to management: fire your current staff and replace them with people who know what they are doing. You have lost my business and if I could give this location a rating of zero stars I would. I will never come back here even if you paid me to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9?start=40

I like that you can look at the menu/order at your table using an electronic touch screen device. Our waitress Naomi was so great keeping our bottomless chips and salsa full, bringing extra napkins, plates, and drinks. She was on top of things and the food was great! I suggest the blackberry sweet tea, it was just right. Also, the Mango Chili Tilapia was good but you probably need a sweet tooth if you are going to order it.

A soup/salad with Sandwich and fries for between $7 and $9.  I had the chicken quessedila instead of the sandwich and got Jalapenos instead of the bacon. It was very good.

Jason L.,"Irving, TX",13,15,7,1.0,8/20/2012,"I went here last Saturday and had a terrible experience. Our waiter was all over the place and just didn't to seem to have time for us. Granted, there were two different tables in the restaurant celebrating birthdays for their kids but that doesn't mean I should have to wait 15 minutes to get a refill on a Sprite. It sad when you have to chase down somebody like you work there. By the way, if you know you're going to sing a birthday song to some kid because it's part of your job then being obnoxious as possible while you do it really makes for a awkward experience for people who are just trying to enjoy their baby back ribs. This actually happened twice within 20 minutes of each other and trust me, the second show was even louder and obnoxious than the first show. Order our food was also a hassle because the original waiter that took our order and wrote everything down and walked off and about 10 minutes later a new server came over an indicated she heard some of what we ordered from our previous server but he said he wasn't really paying attention and to just go ask us again. My first question I was thinking after bein told was, ""Then what was the guy writing down on the notepad? Doodles?""  This was not the first time my experience was unpleasant and I won't be dining inside anymore. The 'to go' area is quick and friendly and I fully recommend that.

My wife ordered the mango Talapia and when she took a bite it tasted like pinesol or some other cleaner.  It was in edible and we has the general manager ""josh"" come over.

Because they have made some exciting changes at this location (and possibly others - I'm not a Chili's frequent flyer). My beau and I came in on a Sunday after church and we were pretty lucky to grab a spot in the bar without a wait. Larger parties were waiting to be seated and restaurant was buzzing, but there definitely was some space for smaller parties. We were quickly given a crash course on a new system called Presto that changed what would be an average dining experience for the better. Pretty much, it's a self service tablet where you can view the menu, place orders, and even pay for your meal when you're ready. It is so stinking easy to use and really a fun concept! It also has games and other features for tables with kiddos. I hope that more restaurants will start to use this system (or something like it) in the future.

I ordered and ate, then debated on even getting the offer but decided I would. I was asked to put my phone number into the machines at the bar and it said ""whoops!"" And that I didn't have an account. I showed them I had received rewards emails the same day and asked if there was anything they could do. After not only telling them it was the actual day of my birthday and showing them the email I had received I was denied by the bartender and also the manager Rick. I am appalled as someone who has worked in the restaurant industry that a manager values a slice of cheap cake over a customer's satisfaction. This is the first time in my life I have not left a tip. If someone tells you it's their birthday, even if you can't find it in your company's bank to fork over the promised cheap cake, you can't even SAY happy birthday to them?

I thought that was really neat. It even let's you check out at your table and,have your receipt emailed to you. Now I love that!  My lunch was great! small portions to eat and not be too full for work. Thanks Chili's my experience was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9?start=20
Kate K.,"Euless, TX",9,72,54,5.0,8/25/2013,"I actually never liked Chili's for the longest time, but I bit my tongue and went with my boyfriend.  My only real problem with Chili's is that their chicken was always greasy and gave me food poisoning, but they've changed since I've decided to not hold a grudge... They have new flatbreads that are to die for! The crust is perfectly crisp and the basil pesto taste soooo good! And no food poisoning three times eating there ;) The new Presto tablet type thing with the games, and you can order on it and pay was amazingly fun and nice to have. Perfect for impatient people. Waiting service though....we have had the most amazing waitress, Jessie, twice. She was kind, compassionate, and really cared to serve us.  But the last time we went, we had an awful experience with Jerremy, but I won't take off a star just for a bad apple.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9?start=20
Jimmy O.,"Houston, TX",82,39,25,4.0,3/15/2011,"Never fails to satisfy. For some reason we always get sat in the section along the windows overlooking the parking lot and Target.  We always get the same waiter, I think Karl, and he's pretty good. I'm here all the time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9?start=20
Anan228 A.,"Irving, TX",65,5,2,2.0,11/1/2015,"I went on Saturday and I asked for reservations  but we still had to wait.... then we had 10 ppl and the waiter was so rude she was a tall black lady it was 10 people and instead of her walking  over to everyone she decides to stay in one spot and one end of the table and had us YELL our drink orders and food order so my friend said ""corn on the cob cut in half"" she yelled it 3 times since the waiter dint come to our end... and my friend  yelled  did you get my order and the waiter said  yes all annoyed like okay i heard you ...  then they brought it back it WASN'T cut in half.... .... really.... then when she came back she would have us pass down the drinks instead of her handing it to us... then we told her we had 2 more people coming in and she said ""what yall gonna do""  like as if she can't help us get a table.... so then we just decided to ask the host... the host was so friendly and so nice we asked her for more other than the waiter... then we never got asked if we wanted refills we would have to tell her our selves... she never came by often.... so she really ruined our night we wanted a different waiter... our party of 12 was dissatisfied  and im.only giving a 2 because of the awesome host",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9?start=20
Michelle B.,"Dallas, TX",109,233,16,3.0,6/29/2012,"Chili's is Chili's.  You're not coming here for innovative cuisine or a unique atmosphere. Why we come: low cal menu makes my stress of finding food within my calorie counts vanish.  Even during peak times, we've never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes.  Service at this location has always been good and efficient.  Food is good value, especially if you go with the 2 entrees and an appetizer for $20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9?start=20
