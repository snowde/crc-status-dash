Cameron L.,"Jacksonville, FL",37,25,2,4.0,1/9/2018,I love their chicken crispers (original beer batter) and my wife loves the Texas Cheese fries. And the chicken and steak fajitas are the best. Decent prices on the kids meals as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Linda V.,"Jacksonville, FL",64,310,790,3.0,11/28/2017,"Since we had this $25 gift card we came to this Chili's which has been here forever! 1st time on a Friday night and we're told would be a 45 min. wait. I looked around and a huge room of tables was roped off.. not in service, we left. We came back on a Tuesday and were seated on the side where it was pretty packed with customers and only 3 servers.  Took about 10 min. to give our order. Then we waited... I got up to look around and the restaurant was not busy.. seemed two places on the sides had the customers... very few any where else including the bar.  As I was looking the hostess asked could she help me and asked if we ordered drinks, I said a couple of beers. She said she look into getting them so I said how about some chips to for our wait.. she said sure! When they came, they looked wet! They were covered in grease so we only ate a few, normally I'd send back but since free we just didn't eat them! Our order came 25 min. later and it was warm..not hot! It looked to be plenty of meat but some was grisly; I had to spit it out. The extras were plentiful and tasty-grilled onion, red/gr. peppers, not warm black bean soup, rice, sour cream, guat, tomatoes, shredded cheese.  After we got our bill they charged us for the greasy chips! I asked hostess about it and she said she'd call her manager, he came, I explained and he took them off the bill. In general the staff was friendly but I think they are understaffed so service is slow and food is only warm! I hope I don't get anymore gift cards for Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Dona P.,"Jacksonville, FL",19,12,,1.0,11/20/2017,"Waited a full 5 minutes at the door before anyone even greeted me. It was not busy at all. When I finally was acknowledged and seated it was another full 5 minutes before I even saw a server. He acknowledged me and said he'd be with me shortly as he went to take the order of the table next to me. They were there when I got there and he was just getting to them to take their drink order! Again, it was not busy at all! At that point I decided this was going to take way too long for lunch and left. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21

Sean M.,"Jacksonville, FL",206,472,237,4.0,12/27/2016,"I came in for lunch with my wife a couple of weeks ago and had a solid, if unspectacular visit.  One of the reasons for our visit is the Chili's Reward Points I've accumulated that needed to be used before the year ends. I figured I'd get some food (we were starving) and I'd save a little cash too.  After being seated and drinks being served, I come to find out that the points I'd like to use didn't work for what my wife or I wanted. We had plenty of the points, but since we always get the ""Two for $20"" deal I was told that it wouldn't work. Not a deal breaker, but now I know that I have to come back again by myself to get the free entrée I wanted.  Service was very good though. Our waiter was friendly and made sure to check in on us a couple of times while refilling our drinks and such plenty of times.  It was a nice time, a good meal and we left happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21

Ashton J.,"Jacksonville, FL",366,68,178,5.0,1/9/2017,"I have always had great service here! I love that there is a vegan option on the $22 for 2 and the $35 for for 2. This option being the fajita with no butter, no cheese, no meat, instead add broccoli and beans to the already existing onions and bell peppers. This comes with a little scoop of guacamole and remember to request for corn tortillas instead of flour. DElicious!!! I love the layout of this Chili's!!! It has a bar section, and different areas that are either focused toward smaller groups/couples or large groups/parties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Thomas T.,"Saint Johns, FL",0,6,,5.0,12/20/2017,"Swung by chili's tonight for dinner and my expectations were exceeded!!! First off the food was amazing I got the steak fajita.

Kinsley V.,"Fruit Cove, FL",55,166,21,4.0,3/5/2017,"My boyfriend and I decided to stop in for a quick causal dinner last night and weren't disappointed. We almost didn't walk in when we saw how many people were waiting to be seated but I'm glad we did because we were seated within 10 minutes of walking in. Our server was friendly and attentive and we never had to wait long on anything. We ordered chips and the loaded queso to start off and the queso was divine! We both enjoyed our entrees, my steak was cooked just right and his fajitas looked delicious. They also have great bar specials all day everyday. 2 for 1 select beers, and house margaritas! If you are looking for something that's a step up from your regular margarita, I recommend their famous presidente margarita! Overall, this is a great casual place to grab lunch or dinner right off of bustling San Jose Blvd.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Susan A.,"Jacksonville, FL",100,228,506,3.0,11/17/2015,"It's a 3 1/2 star... Service was good, food was okay. I got the triple dipper where you can pick 3 of what yo want from a list. I got, boneless honey-chipotle wings, good. southwestern egg rolls, eh. Wont be getting that again. And big mouth bits (sliders) good! Hubby had classic nachos, he said it was good but he added guac for $1 and when we saw the amount of guac you get we both laughed. It was small. very small.  My favorite part was that they have small touchscreen computers on each table. I love that I don't have to wait for the waitress and wait some more for my check. You can just pay right  from your table and leave. Love it!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21

( i loved the grapefruit margarita!)  2) bar food...the food is just ok..I would stick with the apps, maybe the quesadillas, but the rest blah 3) they are open late!  When it's 11 and we get a hunger pains, this is one of the few places still open!  4) good food deals with the app, and 2 entrees for $20 bucks deal",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Bradley H.,"Southside, Jacksonville, FL",108,10,,2.0,7/27/2017,I came to eat dinner here with a party of 7 for a birthday. Service was very slow and the waitress left for long periods at a time and when we got our food 2 of my friends had a piece of hair in their food. It's a clean place but would not recommend for the lack of service and hair in food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Devindra P.,"Tampa, FL",14,12,,1.0,5/9/2017,So went here and no one came to the table at all ended up walking out and going somewhere else this place is a joke,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Derick L.,"San Diego, CA",375,24,132,5.0,2/18/2016,The place has a good vibe and the service is great. They changed their menu periodically so you never tired of the same old type of foods. I like their steak and their Fajita. Their desert looks great too but I always full after the main course to order them later.  Each table has an individual ziosk so you can pay and leave faster not have to wait for the bill. You can also order drinks on there as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Jeana L.,"Jacksonville, FL",77,177,893,3.0,12/8/2015,"Haven't been to a Chili's in a while. This is my first time at this location. It's funny that I live on this side of the city and never went to this chili. The interior has changed a lot from what I remember. It looks much cleaner and more modern. Of course, we had to wait about 15 minutes before they could find us a table. I love how they have the tablets on each table. You can scroll through each menu item and see how the foods look like for the items that do not have pictures in the menu. I came here with my future father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her daughter for dinner. We came for the family bundle deal for $30 which includes an appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 kids entrees, and a shared dessert. Very great deal for a family. We got the Fresh Guacamole Chips and Salsa, Margarita Grilled Chicken with skillet mashed potatoes & steamed broccoli, 1/2 rack of ribs with fries, 2 grilled chicken kids meal. The chips and salsa was good. The chips are thinner than what I remember in the past. The guacamole was fresh and tasted just right.  The Margarita Grilled Chicken was tender, very moist, and my sister-in-law made a point that it looked and tasted like ""fake"" chicken. I can see and taste by what she meant. It was kind of awkward to see chicken breast being sliced to cleanly and rarely any chicken mean streaks that you usually see. I still ate it anyways as I was really hungry. The skillet mashed potatoes was good and the steamed broccoli was cooked just right, not so soggy and not so raw. The best part was the Molten Chocolate Cake. Love the ice cream in the choco cake method. LOL. Always my favorite. You can never mess up on that dessert. Very cold and warm at the same time. Overall, it was good to pay for the family deal, however, I wished the entrees looked and tasted more real. The chicken was what threw me off a bit. Mostly likely to come here once a in blue moon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Joe C.,"Union, SC",36,8,,4.0,3/8/2017,I really enjoyed my visit to this location not only for the excellent food but for the outstanding service that I received. I was fully informed on all of the specials when I was seated and had a really great rapport with the waiter that was at our table. If you are going to Chili's be sure to check out the fajitas fully loaded they are awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Cathrine C.,"Newport News, VA",389,343,506,4.0,3/20/2014,"DELISH!!! Chili's has definitely stepped up their game in the sit-down restaurant category.  I went to dinner here with my coworker for her 20th bday (which we mentioned to 2 different workers, but went unacknowleded). The menu is HUGE so a lot of page turning...over and over and over again. My coworker and I finally settled for the 2 for $20 dinner. We got our chips and salsa appetizer about 5 minutes later and they were so good! The chips were super crispy and warm and the salsa was the right amount of spiciness. As we were eating we toyed around with the little black tv machines on the table. They are definitely pretty neat, but I wouldn't pay 99¢ to play games on there. I did like that you could order dessert and pay your check on there with a card. And you could even split the check up to 3 times - sweeet! About 5min after that, we were approached by by this awesome balloon guy (his name is Joe) and asked if we had any requests. My coworker said it was her birthday and shed like a turtle. He did that and made me a cat one, and boy were they do cute. We felt bad that we didn't have money to tip him :/ Anyways, our food came in about 15min later and it was so great! I got the chicken crispers with buffalo sauce and my coworker got the same with no sauce mixed in. We only ate about half because we munched through so many chips and salsa.  The server we had was kinda slow on service but he was very nice. We had a great experience just because of how good the food was (and Joe was cool too!). Definitely going to go back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Maya C.,"Jacksonville, FL",208,525,2100,3.0,4/6/2016,"Some friends and I decided to have a spontaneous dinner here just because it was close and we were already in the shopping center, otherwise I'd be like ""let's go try something local"". One of my friends mentioned the 2-for-1 margaritas and I was all in. But when I looked over the menu, I decided to get the Blueberry and Pineapple Margarita instead. Those are not 2-for-1 because they use a top shelf tequila. Fine. I was very happy with my drink that I had to do a little chair dance. I'm not real impressed by the food selection but I did get the ""Make It A Combo"" with half rack of ribs and seared shrimp and sides of broccoli and mashed potatoes. The shrimp were not quite baby shrimp but the next size up. I kinda expected it so went with the flow. The meal was nice and I didn't hear any complaints for any of my friends. We tried to pay using the kiosk at the table but the paper was jammed and we had the kiosk email us our receipts. Service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Scott L.,"Saint Johns, FL",4,25,9,2.0,5/20/2017,"Good food at a great price.  Too bad we ended up with a waiter who didn't speak.  No greeting, he never asked about our food, no refills of drinks, nothing.   A great night out ruined by a waiter who was too good to serve us.   Maybe he will get fired and our next experience will he better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21
Tracey B.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,3,,3.0,1/3/2015,The food was pretty good but the curb side takeout is horrible.  I had no dressing for my salad.

Maggie B.,"Southside, Jacksonville, FL",1,1,,2.0,8/16/2014,"Had lunch with my husband today and the food was pretty decent.  Burger bites and delicious southwest chicken flatbread. However this place is in dire need of a good cleaning and better service.  Server only came back once, after we got his attention, for a refill on our long-empty drinks.  Lots of small bugs flying around our booth which was near the kitchen.

Jim H.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,22,,1.0,4/13/2013,"Not the place to go if you want to have a conversation with anyone at your table. The place has terrible acoustics, and is ridiculously loud. The drinks (even the beer) seemed watered down, and the beer mugs are smaller than average. When one of our party told her the margarita was awful, she whined ""You didn't like it?"" She still charged for it, but had such a rotten disposition it was easier just to pay for it than to argue with her. And the food is just adequate at best. Not a place I'd return or recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=40

When they did, they tried to seat two young girls who came in after our party first.  Our party of seven were all seated at a table that was clearly not made to seat more than four.  We asked a young waitor to move to the larger table once it was bussed. He was the only redeeming factor of this establishment, working quickly to clear a table for us he didn't even wait on.  We waited at least 10 minutes for drinks and 30 for food. A delay would have been understandable had the resturant been busy however there were many empty tables.  Once our food was received the majority of it was either undercooked or cooked for far too long.  The black bean pattie was good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=20

The beautiful thing about this trip is that they have updated their menu since the last time I was in and it's quite impressive. So, today I had a Caribbean salad which is a green salad with pineapple, mandarin oranges, cranberries, bell pepper, green onions, cilantro, sesame seeds and a sweet vinaigrette dressing.  I asked them to hold the green onions and cilantro add grilled chicken, and this salad was pretty dang good.    Not to mention that we had amazing service, I was pretty happy with lunch today!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=20

Not the greatest food and service but rarely is a ""bad experience"".  This was typical. Hostess sat us quickly. Server was prompt and nice. Food was average to good. Overall  goes down as a reliable go to lunch spot.  I have found the bars can have different vibes depending on the location.  Young singles to old regulars. Just depends.

Ursula W.,"Sanford, FL",0,18,,5.0,3/27/2017,"Went to see friends,we decided to go with Chili's order to go. I live in Lake Mary, we always go to that Chili's but there curbside was horrid, something I will never do again. However at this location it was awesome! I went to there order on line, after I placed the order it kept telling me they did not have this or that? So I called Andrew was amazing! He took my order over the phone, went over everything with me two times to make sure it was right. I got there about 20 minutes later to get my food, I wish I remembered the wonderful woman's name who brought me the food also got Andrew for me so I could thank him. The food was fantastic, order was all there and correct,  super hot. Our friend's  live about 11 minutes from this location, even though there were super busy, they made me feel really welcomed, also Andrew took the time to quickly come see me so I could thank him for all his help. I love our Chili's in Lake Mary, but not so much there curb side, but this location they have new fans. My friends had never gone, nor did they know they offered this service, they loved how easy it was, also how great the food was.

I will say if you order the nachos be prepared they're not like any other nachos you would expect they did have a lot of seasoning which tasted good but ultimately way too salty also they had no lettuce no tomato nothing but cheese and chicken on tortillas cut into triangles...also the little touch screen thing at the table that you can pay your check on is useful except you can order anything on it except for drink refills or dessert...very frustrating! go at your own risk,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=20

It took a minute to be seated.  The lunch menu offers soup/salad and half a sandwich.  I chose a house salad and half turkey sandwich.  I requested the bread not be toasted, the server wanted to know if I wanted my cheese melted....I had to let her know if I wanted a cold sandwich.  (It got a little complicated) The salad was ok, the bread (wheat) on my sandwich was a little hard.  It tasted ok, but I did not eat most of the bread.  The server let us know that we should use the device on our table to pay by plastic or pay her with cash. This was my first experience with the ""new"" way of paying.  It calculates the tip for you and you can slide the scale to the percentage that you are comfortable with.  The server sat in the booth with me to explain the device and to clear the table.  (I was not crazy about that)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=20

Ashley D.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,8,,3.0,2/6/2015,"Great food great customer service but I wish it was cleaner. We go to the one that is 10 mins farther just because that one is cleaner. You see food on the tv, wall, table. If it was kept clean then we would start coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=20
Jade P.,"Saint Augustine, FL",0,11,,1.0,10/20/2015,"Don't plan on ordering to go and pulling up in your car for carside to go. Very unreliable if you want to stay in the car with your kids. I had to go inside. A waitress had 2 tables that she was cashing out. She offered to help me. I had a coupon and she had to call a manager. After I cashed out, she then had to go MAKE my food! what? What's the point of ordering online and arriving on time if they don't make your food until you show up? She had to pour our soups, bag chips, pour salsa, make drinks. 15 mins later I was back out the door. NOT an easy process. The food is great. The service and the system for to go is a joke!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-21?start=20
