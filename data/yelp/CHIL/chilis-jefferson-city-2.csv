Chuck H.,"Jefferson City, MO",81,15,2,2.0,6/4/2017,"Basic chain. Service is not great but it's a really high calorie meal. There's this weird deal where a dude and his father are some time your waiter ""team."" Weird when he says ""my dad will be over with your soda.""  PLates are hot, btw. I'd rather do ruby tuesdays but if you gotta eat, it's a place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Heather H.,"Jefferson City, MO",64,108,200,5.0,3/10/2016,"Chili's always outshines Ruby Tuesday's and Applebee's in my opinion. The staff has only gotten better over the past few months. The food is always great and most times you can sign up for their email club and get a discount. They now have little kiosk's at the table (think a tablet on a holder) to play games and you can also pay there with your card. Loved that part. I've yet to have an entree I didn't love from here. Me and some friends always have our lunch dates here, even when we have the kids. There is sometimes a wait but it's never too long and has been a good experience in the past few months.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Mark M.,"Morrison, CO",16,119,30,3.0,1/27/2016,"It's a chain, what can I say.  If nothing else they are consistent and you know exactly what you're going to get eating here.  So if you like the food you're safe.  If you have had a bad experience in the past, they're not changing your mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Alyssa B.,"Wenatchee, WA",0,14,7,3.0,7/2/2014,"Very bad experience. I will say we've gone in the past and it was okay, so that is why I've given three stars instead of two. The service was incredibly slow (we came for appetizers in the bar area and it took us around 1.5 hours to order, eat, and leave). It took a very long time for our server to arrive and take our order. The bar seemed almost empty. Our drinks sat empty for quite awhile a few times so we had to flag someone down. When we asked about specials in the bar, the server didn't know any. We had to ask her if she could please find out.  The salsa was like water, which is a bummer because we came there for their tasty chips and salsa. I do appreciate that they gave us our chips and salsa free because of that. My mother ordered a burger and got probably half the fries she would normally get. My appetizer quesadilla was good. So, poor service, bad salsa (but not always), skimpy amounts of food. :(  Also, our table was falling down. It was slanting badly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Steven B.,"Jefferson City, MO",4,2,,2.0,5/14/2015,"Waitress is obviously high. Just came back after 20 minutes to ask us what we ordered and that was after 10 minutes ago when she said the other waiter asked her if she put in our order but she was ""sure"" she did. Now the other waiter just came and took our order again. Wondering at this point of we will ever get to eat. *Update* Manager was nice enough to comp our lunch and fire the waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Cindy A.,"Saint Louis, MO",14,16,6,5.0,12/2/2014,"Amazing service delicious food, this was my first time in Jefferson City and I will definitely eat here again after we move here or if we visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Adnan O.,"Jefferson City, MO",2,28,,2.0,10/26/2014,Went 3 people. Only my experience was horrible. They got 'okay' experience.. It was dad&daughter's night and they allowed us to sit with my 5 month old withput waiting... Thanks again... Ordered chicken&steak fajita.... Steak side of fajita was gummy and not joking couldn't eat any piece of it... chicken side was also below average because it did not taste as it was grilled... Told the waitress the problem. She was understanding and told the manager the problem. She approached to our table and offered to change it but we were in a hurry i had to refuse it. She was polite enough to offer free desert unfortunately had no time. Approach of staff and management was positive but fajita steak was just bad.. Hope next time i won't have any issues like that,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Jodi L.,"Jefferson City, MO",0,58,42,2.0,9/17/2014,"We usually have better luck here but this week the service was severely lacking and I was served these potatoes with dry,  crusty,  been-under-the-heat-lamp-way-too-long potatoes.  Gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Z D.,"Jefferson City, MO",0,3,1,1.0,6/15/2015,"First of all if I could do a half star I would; the service was terrible, food was cold, and I felt like I was sitting in at a Jerry Springer show. The staff was extremely rude talking about their personal lives in front of all customers. We vividly heard one waitress talk about her paycheck, night watching Netflix, boyfriend, and children.  Overall the experience was awful!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Robin L.,"Chamois, MO",0,1,,1.0,7/1/2014,Went for lunch with a group and everything about this experience was horrible.  Our waiter was rude and slow and disappeared for great lengths of time.  We waited 30 minutes to place our order.  Had to ask 3-4 times for water to be refilled even when after 3 times other drinks were refilled but no ice was ever brought.  After and hour and 15 minutes the manager callously comped our food and we still waited for it to be boxed up.  A couple of us went on back as we were already 30 minutes late back from lunch.  When the food got to us it had bee tossed into boxes.  I had to put my sandwich back together as it was slung all over the box.  I was completely disgusted with everything about this restaurant and would rather starve than go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Thomas L.,"Jefferson City, MO",0,5,,5.0,4/7/2016,"The wife and I were looking for inexpensive food, served on non-paper.  We've got an assortment of chain restaurants in Jefferson City, and Chili's is generally the best; though not the cheapest.  We had a 2 for $20 special: onion rings for an appetizer, cajun chicken on pasta for me & mango chili tilapia for my date; and a couple of their inexpensive margaritas.  The food was good and plenty filling, though not entirely worth writing home about.  Waiter gave great service; he even brought out go-boxes just as we finished eating - without being asked!  The manager stopped by and apologized that the margaritas weren't out sooner, though I personally like to drink a glass of water first so as to take the edge off my thirst.  For the price ($27+tax for the two of us), tonight - Thursday - Chili's was much better than I expected.  If you are in town and don't mind chain restaurants, this is a good one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Hal V.,"Jefferson City, MO",0,13,2,2.0,5/22/2015,"Have to bdelieve Chili's was having one of those bad evenings when everything was snake-bit, because they couldn't stay in business, otherwise.  Food was wrong & cold.  Service slow and uninspired.  I blame this on poor staff training and that's management's first job.  The menu is really mostly bar food, which I know may be preferred by many (younger) guests, but not me.  Sorry.  I'll go back in a month or so and if no improvement, I'll really let loose on 'em in this venue...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Virginia F.,"Jefferson City, MO",0,15,,3.0,4/30/2014,The food is ok but the service is always bad. Been here multiple times and usually have a problem. Usually don't get the appetizer until after the food and instead of taking it off the check they offer to give you a dessert instead. Food takes about 45 minutes to an hour. Good bar menu but takes forever to get drinks. Good if you aren't really in a hurry,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Bob N.,"Helena, MT",0,15,,3.0,10/3/2014,"I wasn't impressed with this chillies. We went on a Wednesday night. Took a while for our food. The food was decent to good. Some small portions. The waitress was nice, she never even offered refills though. Then we got the bill, I felt very overcharged for basic burgers and fries",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Dusty M.,"Columbia, MO",1,48,2,4.0,6/20/2010,Pretty spicy but I always enjoy my meals at Chilis.  If you are into quiet place to eat this is not the place but it is family orientated.  Make a point to eat lunch or dinner its worth the stop.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
Anthony D.,"Jefferson City, MO",1,28,1,3.0,2/2/2009,Pretty good food.  Pretty spicy.  Not your place when all you want is something bland like meatloaf.  Tacos and steaks are pretty good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jefferson-city-2
