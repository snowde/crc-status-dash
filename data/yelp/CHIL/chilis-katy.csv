Niece J.,"Panama City, FL",1,8,3,4.0,1/3/2018,"This is my favorite  chili's in the houston area! The food is always good,  drinks made well,  and the service is always good.  The bar area is my fave,  just seems to be where the best service is. I refuse to go to any other chili's because I love this one soo much",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Theresa A.,"San Marcos, TX",73,2,,1.0,12/30/2017,"Chili's is by far my favorite restaurant of all time; I even got $75 gift cards over Christmas. We went there today and ordered the guacamole. By the time we got our meal, my stomach was already upset and I couldn't eat any of it. My stomach literally had me throwing up on the way home and I'm still sick. My husband hasn't eaten since after we ate there due to his stomach as well. I'm so sad, and don't know when I'll be able to eat there again. I've NEVER gotten sick from a restaurant before, so I'm going to be a little Chili's gun shy for a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Irving G.,"Sugar Land, TX",54,16,5,4.0,8/4/2017,"I ordered cheese fries, Cajun chicken pasta,   Chipotle honest chicken! Cheese fries and side fries were saggy but it's understandable because I had take out. Pasta was pretty good, I'm going to ask for extra Cajun next time though.  Service over the phone was great and she got my whole entire order right and same as the kitchen. I can't complaint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Troy S.,"Katy, TX",24,1,,3.0,10/24/2017,The food was not bad at all but the service to be desired for. Ordered a beer and thought was going to have to get it myself and then only saw server one time during meal and that was when brought the food until we were ready to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Jerry H.,"Katy, TX",126,53,2,5.0,1/26/2017,Much better!!! We stooped going here a year ago because the service and quality had declined so badly. We decided to give it a try again and the server was super attentive and the food was great and prompt.  They must have changed management or something and I like it! Thanks for improving things. Always loved Chilis before and was disappointed we couldn't expect better before. We will try again soon! Great job!  Sweet Tea Rating: 8/10 The sweet tea is very good! Better than it used to be. Not sure what they changed but I'm glad they did.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Heather G.,"Katy, TX",29,21,3,1.0,1/11/2017,"I wish I had reviewed this place before coming here.  The table we were sat at literally had an entire order of French fries and corn under it.  Took over 5 minutes for a waiter to take our drink order. Another 5 minutes for the drinks to come out.  Chips and salsa. 80 percent broken crumbs. After 15 minutes of waiting for the waiter to come around we gave up and asked the hostess.  The hostess is the only one who does her job. Our drinks were not refilled for 15 minutes and 25 minutes have passed since we ordered our food and still nothing.  My husband's drink refill wasn't even correct. He had sweet tea, the waiter brought regular. ***final update*** Food took 40 minutes. I asked to speak to a manager, this while my drink sat empty. I explained the various issues we had. She basically just looked down and never apologized. When the food came out, my daughter's ribs were cool, not even warm. My sour cream on my quesadillas was warm. Sour cream should be cold.  The actual manager, Juan, did come out after I asked for the check. I do feel he was genuine in his apology for the awful experience we had here tonight. I appreciate he took the time to apologize. I hope this place can take the constructive criticism and improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Renata S.,"Katy, TX",7,75,17,1.0,11/23/2016,"I don't leave this negative review lightly... It takes a lot for me to give such a poor rating. But we gave them every chance, and they just didn't deliver. Now I know why they have a 2-star average rating. I went there because we hadn't been in years, it's here close to home, and I'd been going to Chili's since I was a teen! My husband and I even went there while dating, and I took my kids there as babies (other locations of course)... So why not? They have a diverse menu anyway... But we will not be back. Not only did the food take 40 minutes to arrive (burger, chicken tenders, ribs, and a turkey sandwich)... But it just wasn't good. Even the chips and guac/salsa were very disappointing. I can go to HEB, Kroger, or even Target and purchase way better Tortilla chips and dips! My simple Turkey sandwich was greasy (not in a good way!), the bun soggy w mayo and butter, and not tasty. The onion rings were over-battered, the French fries under-cooked, and the Mac & Cheese thick and pastey. My husband did not like the chicken tenders much, my daughter said the ribs were OK, and my son said the burger was OK (but he adores bacon burgers, so he'd eat it no matter what). The service was very slow, although friendly. We did have to ask about our order after 40 minutes, and then were told that they were just waiting on one thing (while the other plates sat under the warmer)... The manager came over and apologized, but made no attempt to offer any reparation, discount, or comp a beverage or dessert. So we are left feeling frustrated and hungry. One last thing, the bathrooms are extremely messy, one clogged toilet, and no toilet paper in 2/3 stalls. It was just a bit gross, honestly. It was just such a poor dining experience... I enjoy eating out with my family, and I hate coming home disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Lauren E.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,5.0,6/23/2017,"I had a really positive experience two nights ago.  Sat at a booth in the bar area, the bartender was extremely attentive to everyone's needs.  She was very friendly!!!

Veronia J.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,5.0,10/29/2017,"I was honestly not a big fan of chillis, until I visit the chillis on grandparkway.  I am more than pleased with the food & service every time me & my fiancé dine in. we usually get a different server but overall we get the best service.

M G.,"Richmond, TX",0,41,25,2.0,5/6/2017,The food was perfect ! The hostess was a moody person. She looked like she didn't want to be there and NEVER smiled. She doesn't care and gives you a bad vibe. Our waiter was overwhelmed. There were screaming kids and none of the staff addressed that. Not going back.

Ishnella R.,"Richmond, TX",290,13,2,1.0,9/1/2016,"1) not clean, 2) long wait for orders to be taken during days (22 min, 18 min & 19 minutes on 3 seperate occasions), 3) they bring the entree out about 3-4 minutes after they bring your appetizer, 4) my medium burger was still bleeding so they re-cooked the same meat and this time burned it black. I think I'm done. Shame. I usually love Chili's. Older blonde manager actually said that since I hadn't bitten into the burger she was legally allowed to re/cook it. After they burned it - no offer to make a fresh one or to take it off the bill. What outstanding customer service. Wow",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Alex D.,"Mansfield, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/7/2017,Very poor service by all staff. The bartender was the worst. The manger Dustin made everyone at the table feel extremely uncomfortable and didn't help address the issue. Just made it worse.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Sheridan J.,"Katy, TX",61,27,3,1.0,5/6/2017,"Tried to come here for lunch today. Multiple tables were filthy, very little staff available, and never got seated, because a hostess never came to the front. Waste of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Janann G.,"Katy, TX",8,14,1,2.0,1/2/2017,Not sure what's going on here. The service is horrendous today. I ordered soup and it is awful. The waiter broke 2 margarita glasses and just left the glass and all the ice on the floor. Not impressed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Sarah P.,"Houston, TX",106,183,229,2.0,2/9/2015,"I ordered to-go tonight for my family. The girl who took my order was polite, but I can't say the same for the rest of the staff.. extreme profanity and vulgar language heard at least every minute while I was waiting for my food.  6 oz avocado sirloin (1/5) - I'm not going to give it zero stars because I was able to eat half of it, but it was way too salty. Way way way too salty, and it came out extremely rare. I asked for medium rare, but as I got more towards the middle, blood started oozing out. If I didn't to-go this, I would have asked for another.  I'm only giving my order another star because my parents enjoyed their baby back ribs. I'm really hoping that this isn't undercooked either...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Romina M.,"Richmond, TX",6,37,1,1.0,1/15/2017,"I'm not a big fan of chilis but this chilis takes the cake for having the worst service and food. A few years ago my brother, mother, and I decided to come to chilis since there was not much around at the time. Long story short, my brother was about to take a huge bite into the sand which until he realized how hard it was. He removed the bun and there was a Half thawed RAW chicken cutlet. It was the most disgusting, despicable thing I have ever seen at a restaurant. The best the manager could do was comp the sandwich. After years, my mom and I got a coupon for a free molten cake (the only thing I like there). After waiting for someone to seat us for 15 minutes, we left. This place just sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Rattaya N.,"Houston, TX",250,190,285,1.0,2/21/2016,"Had horrible service and the food was mediocre. Chili's used to be great, but the quality in food and service was lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Victoria R.,"Richmond, TX",0,22,4,3.0,3/12/2017,"Oh my. What can I say about Chili's. It's not fine dining or anything but I feel they have gone way down in the past several years. I used to go quite often (different location) and we actually enjoyed it! This was my first time at this location. The woman who took us to our table looked puzzled when I asked her to measure out one cup of milk for my son (he has Type 1 diabetes and I need to count his carbs). Our server was very nice and the food came out quickly. Okay now for the cons. The music. I get what they're going for with the music but it was very loud. My husband and I were literally yelling back and forth just to be able hear each other. No wonder the group seated behind us was also yelling. The food was okay. My margarita was weak, probably could've used the alcohol to make the meal taste better. I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos. They were cold and the shrimp were so tiny! It came with more slaw than anything else. I also can't stand the yucky rice and beans that come with any ""Tex-Mex"" entree. My husband didn't really appear to enjoy his either. He had leftovers but didn't ask for a box. We will not be returning to this location. We had a gift card so that's the only reason we went in the first place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
Andrew G.,"Katy, TX",4,10,3,1.0,1/31/2016,"It the type of place you pick because nobody in the party can decide where to go eat.  The kids want something wife wants something else.  The menu here has something for everybody,   Unfortunately none of it is very good.  The menu price reflects a high quality burger,  or tacos or Cajun chicken pasta.  But when the food come out you find cheap ingredients and a severe lack of flavor.  The service was good,  we went on a Sunday around noon,  and it wasn't busy yet.  But the meal was so expensive (and disapointing) it was hard to leave a good tip.   I say don't go.  Don't do it man.  Find anything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
ShaNele F.,"Richmond, TX",191,77,77,3.0,11/21/2015,"My family and I visited this location and we were told it would be a 30 minute wait; initially we thought that was too long but decided to stay and we were seated in 15 minutes!  Service was good and so was the food with exception to the food presentation which was messy. The first pizza we received was burnt, but the waiter immediately put in a new order for another. Great value for the food! We will most likely visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy
RealTalk R.,"Houston, TX",0,7,,1.0,11/29/2015,"It had been awhile since I visited this Chili's, I should've stayed away. I ordered chicken fried chicken, fries and corn on the cob for me and my husband. They forgot to give us white gravy and the chicken fried chicken was so dry. The fries were not fresh, I ended up putting them down the garbage disposal HORRIBLE!

Moneer S.,"Katy, TX",0,3,,1.0,11/7/2015,"We where happy to go to chili's we walk in. The staff aren't polite don't greet us or even look at us. She asks us how many people, and we reply 6. We ask for a booth and she takes us to a table. So we ask her again and she says there are none available AS WE HAD JUST PASSED 2 BOOTHS!

Tiffany L.,"Katy, TX",0,23,7,1.0,4/3/2016,"I will not be back to this location for a long time.  I love the menu update, but the service is terrible.  The people are nice enough, just incompetent.  We couldn't even get chips and salsa for over 30 minutes!  The waitress said they were out of chips and had to make more.  Yet the table beside us seemed to have them.  We ordered the famous skillet queso and was told it was cold in the back and they were waiting for it to warm up.  We finally cancelled the order after about 40 minutes.  The food took over an hour to come out, and when it did it was cold.  Could not get drink refills for tea, but used the table kiosk for beer, so that was nice.  We sat next to a huge table covered with disgusting food and empty cups for over an hour, as it seemed no one wanted to buss it.  For our trouble, the manager gave us free dessert, but it took another 20 minutes to get those boxed up to go, honestly I just wanted to leave without them.  This is the second time we have had slow service and cold food.  I wanted to give it another shot, but clearly that was not an isolated case.  Avoid this place if you can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40
Austin Y.,"Katy, TX",12,12,4,1.0,1/21/2015,"On a recent visit we sat in the bar area at a table...place was moderately busy but way understaffed.  Waitress had a ""I don't care attitude"".  After 15 minutes we finally got the ""i'm busy I'll be with you in a bit""  we got up and left.  Manager saw us leaving and did nothing.  Restaurants that focus on cutting labor so much that service lacks will in the long run hurt their business.  Rather than offering all of their cheap specials they should focus on service and could actually charge more.  #whathappenedtogoodservice",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40
Holden F.,"Dallas, TX",125,10,6,1.0,1/23/2016,"I generally hate giving one star reviews, but in this situation I feel it is deserved. I like Chilis usually. It's a pretty decent chain and usually the service is good. This location had some major major problems on our visit though. First off, a couple of reviews have noted the smell when you walk in this place. I immediately noticed a bad smell when I walked in, so the previous reviews have some merit. It didn't take us long time get seated, but it did take us literally forever to get our food. I can't blame this on our server, he did as good of a job as he could considering he was juggling about 6 tables. The restaurant was clearly shortstaffed tonight and it showed. We only ordered soup, salad, and a kids pizza, and we literally didn't get our food for over an hour. We finally got our salad and then had to wait another 10 minutes for our soup. That is just really bad service. Apparently the kitchen lost our ticket. The only saving grace was our server was a great guy and gave us a free dessert to go for the trouble. But I'd highly recommend finding another place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40
Katherine D.,"Houston, TX",1,9,,1.0,6/12/2015,"I have been to several Chili's and this is by far the worst one I have ever been to. The service was horrible! Once the waitress took my family's order, we didn't see her until she brought us our food15 minutes later. Our drinks were empty for 10 minutes and she didn't even offer to refill them when she brought out our food.  Our fries were cold and the list goes on and on.  I will definitely never go back to this Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40
Sharon H.,"Rayne, LA",40,5,,1.0,3/27/2016,This location use to be so good but the service and food has been awful the last two times I have went. We went on a Thursday night for dinner and the food literally took 45-50 minutes to come out. When the food finally came out everything was cold. We asked for the manager and she came over and said she was sorry and took off half of the ribs and offered to remake everything but when it takes 45-50 minutes to come out why the heck would we want you to remake it. Ridiculous! I advise you not to go here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40
Leah H.,"Houston, TX",0,12,2,5.0,2/8/2015,"Honey and I wanted a quick drink and a fast meal so we visited our local restaurant. Was told that they closed at 12 and it was 11; mostly all of the sections were closed as they prepared to wrap up their day. It was mostly empty as expected to be so we seated ourselves and waited for server. Who happened to be this young lady who was  extremely busy working a table or two behind us, cleaning.  Once she came over she was like a breath of fresh air! Funny; energetic and filled with jokes! Amazing customer service at it best! She was knowledgeable about the menu and drink selections .. just a prize! Although we didn't care for our dinning course, the service was superb!

Sean R.,"Richmond, TX",5,5,,1.0,12/8/2014,Just left this Chili's location at hwy 99 and westheimer without even eating.  I walked in with a friend to no host. We decided to sit in the bar side although there was no bartender at that station either. We did see someone walking around after a few minutes that we identified as the host from last time we came in 2 weeks ago. He came to the bar area and spoke with another customer less than 10 feet away from us that was sitting at the bar alone. No greeting at that point or let me get someone for you. We had decided on what we wanted and after over 15 minutes my friend actually had to get up and go in the employees only back area to complain we had still not been assisted.  Shortly thereafter we gave our drink orders only to see the host from last time who also took the order this time around go behind the bar.  He started then flipping through a book to figure out how to make our drink which was their featured drink 901 blackberry smash. At that point we decided it was our best bet to leave. I am writing this review from a different Chili's at I-10 and mason rd because we wanted the food and drinks we saw at the original location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40
Hector L.,"Katy, TX",0,5,,1.0,3/20/2015,Ordered a Margarita and was drinking it until I found a chilis receipt in the bottom of the glass.  The server was great- she apologized and told me that the manager would come by to speak to us.  The manager was horrible - It took him 10 minutes and he didnt apologize and just said that he would discount the drinks.  ITS NOT about the money but CUSTOMER SERVICE.  He didnt apologize and just walked away.  I will NEVER visit this Chilis again.  HORRIBLE,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40
RJ K.,"Houston, TX",15,13,6,1.0,11/11/2012,"My fiance and I ordered two Santa cruz steaks with lime shrimp and it was all terrible.  The plates were piping hot, from what I guess they were sitting under the heating lamp for a lengthy amount of time.  Our waiter Justin I think, was ridiculously slow, too busy hitting on tables that had young ladies from the local schools. He also forgot to tell the kitchen no cheese on my mash potatoes, as I am allergic to milk.  It was not even busy, but it was not worth our time to even complain! We paid, asked for a small to-go container for our guac, a few minutes later our waiter was still no where to be found so we got up and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40
Cristal B.,"Katy, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/1/2015,"I visited this restaurant tonight with some friends that came to visit from NYC. We had a bad service food was good. We walked out of the restaurant a couple of minutes after the restaurant closed. 10 minutes later I noticed I had left my glasses on top of the table and called the location immediately. Spoke to the manager who said my glasses were no where to be found. We were the last ones to leave the restaurant and it seems impossible that my Prada $500 glasses just grew legs and walked out of the restaurant after I left. Manager said she asked the server who assisted our table but still nobody knew what had happened to my glasses. It seems surreal to me that someone that found my glasses specially an employee wouldn't return them. Specially after the owner calling! This is such a disappointment that you can't trust a place where you are being served, that this place has no integrity towards their customers. Smh!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40
Debbie J.,"Katy, TX",0,4,,1.0,2/3/2015,"I have been eating at the same Chili's restaurant out here in Katy for 8 years. In the last couple of years I have been going about 2-3 times a week. On January 2nd, I had a horrible experience there and I was given a business card to make a complaint which I did via email. I left on vacation for two weeks and when I got back I went to Chili's. I saw one of the managers there that I like and she heard my complaint, apologized, paid for my meals, and I left a happy, satisfied, complaint-resolved customer!! On January 26th, I receive a phone call from a man in the Corporate office of Chili's in Dallas stating that he wanted to talk about my dining experience. He called me on Tuesday, January 27th, and he did not talk to me about my experience at all. He immediately told me that I was no longer welcome to dine at the Chili's Restaurant!! I was in total shock! I hadn't done anything wrong except to make a complaint! I contacted KPRC Channel 2 News last Tuesday and they called me right back and wanted to do a story on it. Keith Garvin, Anchor and Reporter with Channel 2 News came to my home on short notice with the camera lady and did the story. Well, today I asked them if they were going to air it and they said no because Chili's never responded to their phone calls which is shocking to me. News stations do stories all the time without permission; I don't know why they needed Chili's approval to do the story. Anyway, this was sad to me as I loved eating there; it was my favorite restaurant. I even celebrated my 55th birthday there back on August 1st!! What an injustice to their best customer ever!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=40

James P.,"Tomball, TX",11,150,4,1.0,6/17/2015,"We returned to this location about 2 weeks ago and were really regretted it. They recently remodeled the inside which makes it look completely different than the old Chili's style we were used to. It's now kind of depressing inside. Our first sign that things were not going to be good was when the parking lot was pretty empty for a Friday night. We should have known better! We ordered the queso which came out completely inedible. It was thick as mud and was chocked full of beans. We asked the server for a new one and he said they only make one batch of queso a day so we were stuck with it. We told him we were not going to eat it as it was nasty. The main entrees came out and they were disgusting too. All the food was cold and not fresh. The quality went downhill. The boneless wings were cold and my wife's chicken was cold too. I then called over the manager and advised her that the meal was totally unacceptable. The food was terrible and I wouldn't eat it in fear of getting sick. She even looked at the queso and remarked that it didn't look right. I told her we would pay for our alcoholic drinks and that was it. On another note, the cleanliness of the establishment was also not to par. The floors were filthy and there was food and utensils all over the place. It was not clean. If the dining area was not clean, I cannot imagine what the kitchen looked like! I had to use the restroom during the meal and that was gross too. It looked like it had not been serviced in ages. It stunk, the floor was completely wet and there were towels everywhere. Someone took a huge dump in one of the stalls, didn't clean up and there was poop on the floor! Usually, when a restaurant remodels, things turn around and it's a pleasure to visit. This Chili's is now depressing and nasty. I now know why there was nobody in the parking lot on a Friday night! We will not be returning.  We did not eat our food as we didn't think it was safe to. My stomach would have been out of control and I would have needed to wear a Depends for about 24 hours in fear of soiling myself.  Chili's is going downhill unfortunately. There are way too many other options in the area that offer quality, edible food with a clean atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Alexander W.,"Houston, TX",999,708,5699,3.0,4/1/2012,"It is a chain restaurant... Service was great today. Restroom was very clean, which is always a plus for me. Tried several of the deal items. For the pick 3 appetizer, tried the new cheese steak slider. Seasoned well, but not enough filling. Wings & southwest egg rolls were as expected. Decided to steep outside my comfort zone & not get ribs! Decided to try the Crispy Honey-Chipolte Chicken Crispers.  Decent tasting, but nothing truly to write home about.

Christian D.,"Katy, TX",170,3,,1.0,6/17/2016,"Horrible service, came for lunch and drinks took 20 min. We ordered our app and lunch by that time and the white queso came out in a huge clump of cheese with greasy soft chips. Service and time was so bad that we left before our food came out. Do not go here",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Katie P.,"Houston, TX",67,27,1,2.0,3/16/2015,"Food is good but the service is regularly awful.  Not that the servers themselves are necessarily bad but they are consistently grossly understaffed.  I counted maybe 3 servers at 12:30 pm lunch rush.  We waited forever to be seated (no hostess... Finally seated by a manager) then forever to order and eat.  This is probably the 6th time I've dealt with this from them and likely the last.   A word to the wise from someone who runs restaurants for a living, servers are cheap!  Hire some!  Staff up!  You're losing a lot of money due to these terrible reviews.   As the mom of an impatient 18 mo old, I can't afford all the extra waiting associated with an understaffed restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Joel H.,"Allen, TX",16,227,31,2.0,6/13/2015,"2.5 stars.  Service is okay.  Food is meh. The Fajita trio is a good value.  You get 12 ounces of your choice of 3 from steak, chicken, carnitas and shrimp.  Not the best fajitas, but good.  Enough for 2 people.  Under $16.  Beans and rice $1 extra.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Donald G.,"Katy, TX",0,4,,3.0,12/4/2016,"OK chilis right now, definitely improving and on the up & up. Looks like they still have pretty high turnover amongst the staff. Good bartender and manager though",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Jenny G.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,6,1,1.0,8/31/2016,"I have consistently had terrible service from this Chili's. Anytime I order something for takeout, the order is missing something or is made incorrectly or missing an item. I have addressed this with employees and management before and they are completely unconcerned. I waited several months and tried to order again recently and of course part of my order, my side salads that I paid extra for, were missing. I don't even bother calling anymore. They're just awful. If the service can't be organized, I can't imagine what their kitchen must look like. Save your money and try Black Walnut, Cheddars, Longhorn Steakhouse, really anything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20

Michael T.,"Fulshear, TX",14,10,4,4.0,11/27/2016,"This Chili's location is always clean looking, and service good.  Food is of course typical Chili's fare and I've never had a reason to complain.  I'll keep coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Erich S.,"Richmond, TX",4,4,,1.0,4/16/2016,Ok. We were in the area and it was getting late. Walked in at 8:30 pm and hostess took us to a table immediately. We sat there for about 15 mins before anyone came to the table. Finally someone took a drink order and we immediately ordered an appetizer. Some of the drinks came out. And some didn't. They brought he wrong appetizer. And had to take it back. And then asked to take out order before we even had an appetizer. We told him we would wait for the appetizers. A little later the other drink came out. Refills? Forget about it. That would never happen. We tried to order a second beer. It came at the end of dinner and we told them to take it off we were ready to go. Food is over priced for the quality. Service is non existence. The dumb computers on the tables don't work and are annoying. This will be my last visit to Chilis.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Monique B.,"Katy, TX",0,1,,1.0,4/15/2016,"Horrible! Hair in my drink, service is non existent and food is not synchronized with how meals need to laid out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Michael S.,"Katy, TX",2,12,,1.0,3/12/2016,"Even though their Baby Back Ribs have always been to die for, I tried to call in a Pick-Up order at around 1:30pm today (Saturday). The phone rang 40 times. Hung up re-dialed then hung up after another 20 rings. Gave it one more try. Someone picked up after 12 rings and asked me to hold. After five minutes listening to raucous background ""music"" I hung up again. For good. (Good Bye, that is).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Edgar L.,"Katy, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/28/2015,Horrible! Came by at 10pm and there was hardly anyone here. I was expecting average to mediocre. Long wait for food and food tasted stale.

Michael K.,"Katy, TX",0,3,1,4.0,3/22/2016,"We have dined here a couple of times and it has been overall a good experience.  We went on Valentine's day and last Sunday, our waitress was the same girl with lots of earrings in her ears.  I forget her name, but she was very nice and took great care of us. The only complaint I have is the cleanliness of the menus and restaurant, especially the smell and the bathrooms. We will be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Marcel H.,"Richmond, TX",136,107,28,2.0,9/18/2014,"My wife and I had not been to this Chili's in a while.  Should have checked Yelp before going.  The food quality and taste is below par.  I had the Fajita Trio and my wife had a steak.  Only thing that did taste good was the guacamole we ordered. The chicken is not a chicken breast but processed chicken patty.  Really?  I'm not at McDonalds!   They used to have a Cajun rubbed steak that was amazing.  If I'm going to spend $40 my meal it better taste good!  Also, the place was not crowded and it took a long time for our food.   I also noticed that the hostess cleans the table before seating you.  Why not clean and spray the tables before your customers come in so they don't have to wait.  Wow!  Whoever is managing this place needs a lesson on how to run a restaurant.   Sorry Chili's!  We used to think your places were good but we will never be back.  Also if your not careful the kiosk will charge you 99 cents for playing a game.   Now I know why the parking lot was not crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Jacqueline R.,"Stafford, TX",4,12,1,4.0,11/7/2014,"Visited this Chili's location on a Friday night. It was packed and we arrived around 8pm. For a table for 2, we were told that there was a 20 minute wait. We were seated in only 10 minutes. The manager actually seated us, seemed that before we got there, some customers were not happy about being told incorrect wait times. I must say that the primary reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because of the hostesses. They serious suck. You are the first person to interact with the customer, why are you not facing the door??? After coming up from behind the hostess and giving her a scare, we were seated. The food was excellent, the waitress was efficient. I never had to ask for a refill, never had to look around for her. Excellent service.  This particular location has been the best chili's spot by far. The Pearland location is awful, the Sugarland location is dreadful, the Katy location on I-10 is horrible, but this one saves the entire chain! I can't speak for the large parties, they seemed to have a different experience, one lady even told me that the hostess lie about the wait times.  I say a 9 out of 10 for this location, definitely will come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Sean H.,"Katy, TX",0,12,,3.0,8/11/2016,"I was a very reluctant Customer given the recent reviews, my daughter chose it. Overall my experience was positive. Service was prompt as was the food and the quality was acceptable. The  system for paying at the table was innovative and quick. My main peeve was the smoking at the bar drifted through the restaurant and that might stop me from returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
Jeremy L.,"Richmond, TX",1,90,14,1.0,2/16/2015,"The food was pretty good. They have made some significant changes in the flavors since my last visit. My wife and I decided to give it another try and would have been happy if the table next to us wasnt so roudy.  The new electronic order menu from their table flew to ours. If manager would have asked them to sit not jump up and down in the booth that might have stopped it.    I approached the manager homer garza.  Who was more like homer simpson from the smell of booze and inability to manage.  I started with the good food ,great service but the table behind me, only to be cut off with we cant control our guests. (Ok card and corp number please.)   The server came over asked what was wrong I told her she apologized then the manager reappeared with the card spouting he cant control, only to be cut off by me saying my conversation didnt concern him he had made his managerial decision already.  Thats when he asked me to leave. I informed him that is one way of controlling a guest just the wrong one.  I think when I informed him the booze was clouding his judgments he wanted to hit me. Corp called me assured me he didnt want to hit me and would i give them another chance( face twitch is what was my first indicator that he wanted to pumble me)  No They will send 40 gift card they say but thats not the point.  If this manager is this way at work how will he react on the streets.  I will keep an eye out so as not to get attacked by what appeared to be a drunk hostile manager, we will also avoid at all cost risking our safety at a place that had no concern of people getting hit with electronic order kiosks. Cant believe that is what I just typed ANIMALS",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy?start=20
