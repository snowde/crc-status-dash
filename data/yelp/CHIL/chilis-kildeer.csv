Ann G.,"Wauconda, IL",0,14,,5.0,1/13/2018,"If I could give this place more stars I would, not only because my food was great, but the staff was too. My servers name was Jackie and she was so friendly and helpful when I was looking over the menu. When I first arrived this young girl with brown hair said welcome to chili's with what she calls ""jazz hands"" and it was so nice to see her enjoy her job. I cant remember her name but it was unique. I cant wait to come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer
Karyn S.,"Barrington, IL",26,146,12,2.0,5/27/2017,"Food is OK, it's Chili's. Didn't get carded this visit, despite being told ""they always card"" (neither of us got carded).  Just heard someone in the kitchen say loudly ""he's half black, so it's fine!"" and then laughter. I'm sitting here in stunned silence and trying to figure out if I want to keep eating or just take my food to go.  My dinner companion just came back from the bathroom and said 'I changed my mind about going to the bathroom', I asked why. He said 'well, it smells like sewer....'  So even though we've come in the past (we are never sure why...), I'm not sure we'll come back to this location. Whatever the comment in the kitchen meant, or was intended to be, it was said loudly by tables, and it feels incredibly inappropriate... I'm actively uncomfortable, and so annoyed that I'm sitting here at my table and writing this in an obvious way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer
Patoots S.,"Mundelein, IL",0,19,,1.0,12/26/2017,"As I went onto Yelp, I noticed that it said the wait time is zero minutes. The wait time is zero minutes to sit down but to actually get somebody to come and acknowledge you or take your order is probably more like 20 minutes. I wouldn't exactly know because we had to go ask the hostess if we could get waited on. We placed our order at least 15 minutes ago and are still waiting for our food. after delivering our drinks I had to go out and get straws and now after getting our food finally delivered,my husband had to go and grab silverware himself, so the service is sub par.They get one star for being friendly and comping is chips and salsa. Wish we would have gone to Red Robin instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer

Sal D.,"Wauconda, IL",0,6,4,1.0,6/1/2017,"Probably the worst service of any Chili's in 5 states that I've been to. No one at the front of restaurant to seat us at 1:30pm. We sat there and watched staff walk right by. We saw an empty booth and sat ourselves. We sat and waited again. I finally asked a server for drinks and she proceeded to say ""your server will be right there"" this after waiting for 15 min in our booth. Sam our server shows up with an attitude and I just no thank you and left. No way I'll spend money at a place like this. Never go there pls read other reviews regarding food poisoning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer
Leslie J.,"Lake Zurich, IL",60,76,12,2.0,1/23/2017,"Ok, it Chilis, it's not the Ritz, I get it. But, it's a restaurant that has been around for a long time and under the circumstances I don't think it will be around much longer, this location anyway. To begin with, service was aweful! We were there ( 10 of us) at 6pm on a Sunday night, the place was DEAD! Why is a CHILIS dead at 6pm on a Sunday night?  You giys are going to have a very hard time getting the locals to come back when you have so much competition surrounding you. So, I'm going to make this fast/ easy. Ordered pink lemonade,  brought it to the table looked funny, wad told sorry the machine is broken. Never got more iced tea, was told sorry the machine is broken. Ordered a mushroom Swiss burger, brought cheddar, was told sorry, no cheddar oh and sorry, no mushrooms. Sent back 2 burgers TWICE not cooked properly. Oh, they also forgot to serve my moms salad after they delivered it wrong the first time. Water machine must have been broken too because we never got more. I DO NOT blame the server, I blame her lack of training,  that is not on her. I did speak to the manager Jaime and she was GREAT,  Chilis better get their act together because she can go anywhere,  she was that good. She was sent there 2 weeks ago to figure out why this location is such a disaster.  ( my words, not hers) I would have given 1 star but because of her I gave 2. Good luck Chilis, you are drowning quickly and I hope thete is a life raft in your midst.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer

Don G.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,9,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Very deceptive, just to get us in the door. Called ahead to get an estimate of how long the wait for a table would be (they do not take reservations here).  They told us that there is no wait for a table.  Drive over there with the family and upon arrival, am told the wait would be over an hour.  I get that the wait time is an estimate and the situation changes, but an hour? Of course I proceed to tease my wife for calling the wrong restaurant.  So, she pulls out here phone, calls the restaurant to ask how long for a table, and is once again told no wait!!!!!!! She confirms that she called the restaurant we are standing in waiting for a table.  She informs the person on the phone that we are at the restaurant waiting for a table.  The person on the phone had no shame whatsoever. With honesty like that, we then left and decided to wait for a table elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer
Gina D.,"Palatine, IL",135,187,253,3.0,6/9/2016,"Decent.  I enjoyed the food but maybe overall average. The waitress go better as we ate, but started off rocky. We had the warm spinach Queso with chips and salsa. The shrimp/steak fatitjas and the cajuin chicken pasta. I got the tito punch cocktail and my mom ordered the blueberry margetrita.  I thought overall delicious and okay service. I'm surprised with everyone's bad ratings but it's also not the greatest.

Heidi M.,"Lake Zurich, IL",6,12,,1.0,10/2/2016,Every time we order from here they screw it up.  This time they didnt give us tortillas with our fajitas.  I ordered mine without onions and they added at least a full onion.  I wish we could get fajitas somewhere else but the meat is good (when they put the correct amount in the order),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer
Danny G.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,2,,1.0,10/5/2016,Do not come to this location they give very poor service. My buddy and I stepped away from the table for a few minutes and came back to a table that was half bused with other people's dishes on the table. They filled our beer halfway and said we should be happy with it. Not to mention the bartender practically threw the check at my friend. When we spoke to the manager she didn't care. I guess you will lose my business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer

Jennifer L.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",113,564,985,4.0,7/18/2015,"I've been to this location numerous times. It seems fairly consistent both with service as well as food!  It's in the shopping plaza across the street from Deer Park mall, in a stand-alone building. It's usually fairly busy. Seems fairly clean. Food is usually good and the waiters/waitresses are nice. I can't remember ever having a bad experience here.  They also do carry-out! So if you're in the mood for their food, or for something other than drive-thru's, order some carry out from Chili's! They have curb-side parking so you can run right  in the side door to grab your food, and get out quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer

Katie S.,"Rolling Meadows, IL",0,5,,4.0,11/6/2016,"4 stars solely because they made right with not putting my order in when I got food to-go. I got there and they didn't see my order in the system, then it turned out they never started making it. I had to wait about 15-20 mins, but they gave it to me for free, so I'm very happy with their customer service.

Amber R.,"Chicago, IL",25,6,,1.0,8/7/2016,"When my family and I first walked in the host sat the five of us at a four-top table even though the restaurant was pretty much empty. Our waitress was nice but she couldn't even remember our drink order.. that she wrote down... She messed it up twice. I don't mean to throw her under the bus but we saw her messing around with the staff more than actually making sure her customers were happy and taken care of. When we finished our chips and queso we pushed our empty soda mugs to the end of the table for her to take and she walked past our table at least 3 times without even glancing at it and so did several other waiters as well as the host. No one brought shells out for my fajitas and we had to ask twice for a side of sour cream. The fajitas normally come out sizzling hot, but this time they came out luke warm and limp. When the food runner brought out our meal we were confused by the two different plates of quesadillas we ordered. When we asked him which ones were which he looked like a physical deer in headlights. We had to look at a menu to figure out which ones were which. We sat for about 5-8 minutes waiting for our check while our waitress walked back and forth past our table filled with 5 empty mugs and empty plates stacked high even though the restaurant was nearly empty. My family and I are always kind guests and we're very laid back about service but this experience was just a clusterf***. If a manager was anywhere in the restaurant it didn't show because all of the staff was just standing around. I guess it's our fault for going to a two-star rated Yelp restaurant but like I said, we usually aren't very picky.  We stuck it out but the disappointment was real.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer
Jeana B.,"Barrington, IL",0,11,,2.0,5/12/2016,"Today we decided to go Chili's for lunch. We had not been there for a year or two. We were seated promptly by a girl who said she would be waiting on us. We placed drink orders and received them in a good amount of time then placed our lunch orders. We both ordered lunch combos, I got the chipotle fresh mex bowl and my husband ordered the double burger & fries. They both came with soup which took the server 15 minutes to bring to us and the soup was barely warm. After eating our soup and finishing our drinks it took our server a very long time to come back and ask if we wanted drink refills. Finally we received our drink refills then asked about our food order as it had been 40 minutes since we ordered, I mean it's only a burger and a chicken bowl. She said something about the kitchen and walked off and after waiting some more we finally got our lunch with a half hearted ""sorry for the wait"". Again none of the food was hot just barely warm. My husbands burger was dry & well done and the chicken in my mex bowl was rubbery like it was microwaved. I should also mention that they were not busy while we were there but rather empty. Now we remembered why we haven't gone to Chili's, slow sub-par service and unsatisfactory food. Not again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer

Taylor M.,"Bloomingdale, IL",562,1072,903,4.0,8/21/2010,"I have no issues with the tap water they serve and I always heard that legal all restaurants have to filter their tap water before serving it. Anyways, I this is the Chili's I always go to and I have never had an issue. As far as Chili's go, I think this is one of the best! The service is great, my order is always right and the manager is always walking around greeting customers and asking how their meals are. I went for lunch two weeks ago to try the all you can eat soup and salad and it was really good. I liked the cheesy enchilada soup and Caesar salad.

David K.,"Mundelein, IL",0,6,,1.0,3/21/2014,My first slam on yelp. I don't like to slam anybody but I couldn't just ignore how pathetic my meal was yesterday. Dry rub ribs. Thinnest ribs I've ever seen. Whatever animal they sacrificed had an eating disorder. The food was so overcooked I struggled to eat anything. I should have gone to 7/11 to buy beef jerky. It couldn't have been any worse. Didn't have the time to return the meal. I was in a hurry.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=40
Diana I.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2014,If I could give this chili's no stars I would.  Karen is very unprofessional.  We waited 40 minutes for our food. When our food arrived it was missing sides and it was dry.  My friend took one bite of her burger and it was bone dry.  We asked Karen the manager if we could switch her meal and she said you'll have to pay the difference. The waiters were more worried about their own personal problems than the customers service. It was a very bad experience.

We did see his back several times at a friends table.  We asked the blonde waitress in the bar area to get our waiter we said we didn't get the water nor the soup for the combo. She was very nice to bring it to us. Eric still didn't show up. We finished and  got his attention. With the bill he asked did we need anything else. We said no the other waitress got it.

However, this visit was far under par. I've had several visits to this particular Chili's location that fit in this category, unfortunately. The water is funky, the servers are rather unengaged, and the food is handled poorly. I had the shrimp tacos, which I LOVE at every other Chili's, but these were wrapped in stale tortillas, and extremely-over-ripe-borderline-rotten avocadoes.

Stephanie A.,"Lake Barrington, IL",8,3,1,1.0,5/1/2013,"I'm a chili's regular but I will NEVER return to this location. Dined here yesterday and had my worst chilis experience ever. We sat in the bar area and there was only 1 other table. The menus were beyond disgusting! They were caked with so much food and something sticky that the pages were getting stuck together. Drinks were delivered promptly but when our pretzel sticks came to the table I was extremely disappointed. The cheese looked as if it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while on top of the fact that the ramekin was only half full. (Luckily they were free since I'm a member of their email club.) Our server never returned to take our order until we were practically done with the app. When a server returned, not our server because he was ""too busy"" since he had 1 other table, she took our order for him. When I asked about the cheese I was told that's how it always is and that its one of the things she really dislikes on their menu. Dinner took awhile to arrive and it was just ok to say the least!!! The fact that the best part of our meal was the carmelized onions on my fajitas is embarrassing!!! During our visit a single man was also sat at a high table in the bar area. I watched him get up and go to the server station to get something to clean his table because it was never wiped down. He then asked one of the servers to clean it for him. He did not look happy!!! I will return to chili's but never to this location!! There are so many other places in deer park to dine and I'm sorry that we chose chili's!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=40

Joseph P.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",30,471,1434,2.0,1/22/2012,"Saturday night and nearly dead at 9pm.  Not a good sign. Came here for an after-movie dinner and came away wishing I'd gone somewhere else, as they have slipped from past performance.  Started with the Southwest Egg Rolls - 3 ""tubes"", each sliced in half, for $9.  Ok, but not worth it.  The Spicy Chicken Wrap was pretty good.  The Buffalo Chicken Ranch sandwich was not - a dry, hard coated chicken patty deep fried, with a little ranch dressing & hot sauce dabbed on top, on a bun.  Both come with plain fries - fresh, but nothing special. Service was friendly, but sloppy - server spent too much time gabbing with the bartender across the room, and didn't deliver the hot sauce requested nor refill drinks in a reasonable time. All around us, others were loudly cleaning up the place as if getting ready to close - at 9:30?   The new wireless ""Video Toys"" on the table are novel, but have limited use - they are mostly electronic menu suggestions and a pay-for-play game machine.

The kids had chicken fingers that came with mandarin orange slices - great idea and both the kids finished the fruit. My friend had salmon which must've been OK as she finished it - with a little help from her kids. I wish I could recall the server's name because she really was attentive and deserves a mention - especially since many of the previous Yelpers had a bad service experience.

Lefai K.,"Chicago, IL",282,636,421,2.0,6/30/2013,"I remember going to Chili's to be a treat. This was probably because I grew up in the city and there were no any. We would go to Lincolnwood Town Center and go there when we were in highschool. I remember it was the first place I experienced a chicken quesadilla and I thought it was fine dine cuisine.   Fast forward to 15-years later and living in the burbs where I'm constantly bombarded with suburban mainstays like Applebees, Chilis and Olive Gardens. Now I remember why I don't come here much anymore. This place reminds me of Chicago weather -- if you don't like it, wait a few minutes and it'll change. The waiter informed us that their menu changes every 6-months. It's interesting that they have this policy as the menu was 10-pages long and it seemed like there was at least 100 items offered. It was almost like the Walmart of restaurants, except the prices weren't walmart prices.   I opted for the $8 lunch special which came with a soap and lunch. The soup I got was the Spicy Southwest Chicken & Sausage Soup. It should have been called the Spicy Salt & Salt soup. I think the chef must have dumped a whole bag of salt in it... it was barely edible. We also ordered the Chipotle chicken Margarita flatbreads and it was burnt, the chicken was barely there, and the tomatoes where barely there. Not so good either. The chicken fajitas were decent. BATHROOM REVIEW: The bathroom was somewhat clean, but it smelled like a  giant urinal cake. What was interesting was that the paper towel dispenser was right next to the sink, while the soap dispenser was further away. Meh, I guess its not complicated, but I dont like to think when I'm peeing. Its my Zen time and I like to be at peace. Sit or squat? Squat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20

Dina L.,"Chicago, IL",4,20,8,4.0,10/8/2015,"I was contemplating meeting friends at this Chili's for drinks later today and looked it up on Yelp, not to see the reviews, but to remind myself exactly where it was in relationship to Deer Park. I was so surprised to see the dismal reviews! I am no fan of chain restaurants and will normally scour Yelp, especially when traveling, to find ANY place besides a chain restaurant. However, a few months ago, some friends and I were going to go see a movie at Deer Park and one suggested we eat here first. I didn't want to be *that* chick -- you know the one -- the high maintenance one who puts her nose up at the others' choice of restaurants -- so I agreed. And I was so pleasantly surprised. The food was above average, the service was great. We were only disappointed that we hadn't left ourselves enough time before our movie to order dessert. I even remember what I had, the Fresh Mex Pairing with a Tostada and a Green Chile Chicken Enchilada. Sorry my date is not specific. To give you a timeframe, we saw ""Gone Girl"" right after it came out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20
Doggielover H.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,11,,1.0,3/4/2014,"We had the most awful experience here today. Our waitress was rude, when asking for more chips and salsa she said ""give me a minute"". It took 40 minutes for our lunch to come, the manager apologized and offered a dessert. When the waitress took our dessert order, she took my daughters orders and walked off, not asking if anyone else wanted one. I think that Chilis is a good restaurant, but this location seems to be going downhill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20
Danielle S.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,3,,2.0,12/22/2015,"I visited this restaurant a few weeks ago and I believe I got food poisoning from either the pico de gallo or the lettuce on the plate of nachos, as the others who ate the nachos did not get sick.  However, I was the only one who ate the lettuce and the tomatoes. I've never been so sick and this makes me never want to dine at this restaurant again. Be careful with the sides for everyone who visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20
Linda W.,"Barrington, IL",0,2,,1.0,12/7/2015,"We arrived at 3:30 and didn't leave until almost 6, mind you Chilis was completely dead. After taking our drink order the waiter was too busy hanging out in the kitchen with the rest of the staff to be attentive. We were actually contemplating getting up and looking for our waiter so we could order. The rest of the staff just walked by us even though we needed refills. Maybe 45 minutes later we flagged down our waiter, who did not apologize for the lack of service, and ordered. This was hands down the worst dining experience that I have ever had. The staff was lazy, dismissive, and incredibly inattentive. I would not recommend this location to any one and will not be visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20
Archie P.,"Palatine, IL",23,28,11,2.0,4/27/2014,"04/27/2014  Food was good, service was good.  I'm rating my experience today with a 2 stars, because the utensils are filthy, you can see the marks from previous use. Even the plate my food came in, you can see it was not washed that well. I could've sent it back, or not have eaten it. We all know what could happen when food is sent back. This should be one of the main priorities of restaurants. Make sure the utensils, and plates are clean.    The menu I had was clean, cleaner than my plate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20
Valerie D.,"Deerfield, IL",447,613,101,3.0,10/3/2012,"Before my recent visit, it had been YEARS since I had stepped foot into a Chili's.  Probably at least two.  And probably two before that. Chili's was the place I frequented in college, because, let's face it, when you had to get out of the dorms for a ""real meal,"" Steak and Shake didn't cut it, and Alexander's Steakhouse was out of the ramen noodle budget. But... I'm not in college anymore.  So, I like to frequent independent places when I can, instead of chains. At any rate, we went to the movies on Sunday and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat afterward.  My BF wasn't very hungry, and neither of us wanted to break the bank.  He remembered that they had cheap drink specials.  Win. We sat in the bar area at a booth.  Our server was prompt, and brought drinks quickly.  We ordered two appetizers to share: Texas Cheese Fries: the cheese wasn't very melty, and there were many fries underneath that didn't have any cheesy goodness. Triple Dipper with chicken crispers, big mouth bites, and southwestern eggrolls.  I always remember the breading on the chicken crispers being really thick, but the chicken underneath (which i pulled the breading away from all together, was tender and juicy.  The wrapper on the eggrolls seemed pretty thick too, and a little chewy.  I didn't try to big mouth bites. My BF thought everything was delicious.  Of course. What I REALLY wanted, was the southern smokehouse bbq bacon burger, but... my diet said no, you can still make a more responsible choice. We'll see next time...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20
Ashley S.,"Lake Bluff, IL",65,228,13,3.0,9/11/2012,"Well the service kind of stunk here, but the food was great and the deal we got was even better!  We decided to do the 2 margaritas, appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert for $35.  It was a fantastic deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20
Mike F.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",12,31,4,1.0,11/8/2013,"I don't know what is going on at this place, or why I am stupid enough to keep going back. The service is absolutely terrible. The last time we went there, the water was BROWN. The server says, ""we have well water, so sometimes it looks like that. It's fine though.""  What?! The most recent time we went, our server would disappear and not check on us. In the meantime, me, my wife, and 3 kids had all run out of drinks. He dropped off our check and disappeared again! After waiting 10 minutes, I finally walked to the register and waited for another server to ring us up. I'd say that I will never go back, but I probably will. I'm dumb like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20
Alex ..,"Lake Forest, IL",21,63,3,2.0,2/11/2015,"I tried that Chili's to go as I placed an order on there website. I did arrive little early more like 15mins. I did place a specific time for pick up thinking I would get there late. But coming from 53 on the way home traffic wasn't to bad around 7pm on a Friday. So I walked in and asked if my food was ready. They said no plus your early It would take them 15mins to make it. Ok fine as it would be right off the grill and hot. Was my thought!!!   Well, soon as I got my food home to eat it. The burger wasn't to great kinda dry and didn't taste to well. Southwestern Eggrolls taste like crap.. I have to admit eating inside Chili's is a different experience and pretty much there carry out is garbage. Twice this has happen and each time a different location. ""Never get it to go your better off eating inside"". To be honest Chili's is very similar to Fridays, Applebee's and I'm getting sick of them. They were great as a kid growing up now it's disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20
