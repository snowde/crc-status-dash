Monica C.,"Pasadena, CA",1074,494,537,3.0,1/9/2018,"It's a Chili's- made popular by awkward first teenage dates and large family gatherings. If you don't know the food then you haven't been living in the US in the past decade. This is a rather large Chili's that exists in it's little mall. Service for lunch was A OK, although the orders came out wrongish. If you order iced tea- they pretty much give you a bucket of it, which makes up for the order mistake in my book.  It was 114 degrees the day I went and the AC was working very well. That's worth all the good service in the world to me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore
Kery G.,"Palmdale, CA",98,30,11,2.0,1/6/2018,"Service was slow, waitress did not come around until after we received our food which by that time all of our drinks were empty. Ordered an old timer with a black bean patty. I specifically told her ""no"" when she asked if I wanted cheese. Burger came with cheese, had I wanted cheese I'd have been highly disappointed as it was almost indistinguishable but for the crispy bits on the side. When my burger came back it came with fries and garlic pickles thrown on the side, no mustard and a mushy black bean patty that wouldn't stay together. The 2 stars is due to the 3 other people being satisfied with their food. The last time we ate at a Chili's (Santa Clarita) the service and food (mine) were also unsatisfactory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore
Daniel A.,"Anaheim, CA",208,208,98,1.0,12/27/2017,"my family met another family at this restaurant on tuesday 12/26/2017. the restaurant was crowded but because of the online reservation, we were seated quickly and the server took our drink and appetizer order. a few minutes later, we ordered and the food came out quickly... I have to tell you: I rarely leave negative feed back for a restaurant but this time I was really disappointed.  my daughters quesadilla salad was not edible. The leaves of lettuce throughout the dish were brown and wilted, the chicken was undercooked and had a mysterious slimy coating, the entire dish including the quesadilla slices was drowned in waaay too much dressing. no part of the the entire dish was edible. unfortunately, she did not say anything until after I had closed out the check.  another thing that was not pleasant: the Ziosk tablet computer terminal that was left at our table was covered in what felt like the last several hundred customer's sauces and sugary drinks which had dried to a sticky / greasy mess on the exterior surface of the device. when I went to pay the bill my hand was instantly contaminated with the food residue from what felt like every patron who had ever sat at that table. I actually had to wipe the screen clear of dried sauce just so i could sign the bill. just plain disgusting. I mentioned the situation to the waiter and he said it was because they were so crowded and understaffed. I get it. It is not the waiters fault. I would expect a chain like chili's to at least offer to the terrible salad off the ticket but they did not.  I find it disappointing that a big chain restaurant like chili's would have a nice family dining experience destroyed by careless housekeeping and a terrible presentation on such a simple dish. Maybe this was just an off night for this restaurant's staff... but I can tell you that I will not be back to this location to find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore
Stephen C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",18,35,41,4.0,12/30/2017,"Chili's was busy this afternoon, we waited 15 min before getting a seat. I don't mind the wait, but there was empty tables and tables that had not been cleared off from the last guest plates and drinks (seemed that someone called out or restaurant is short staffed). I ordered the spinach queso dip for me and my wife to share. Dip was good, however the paper thin chips did not work well for scooping dip (need to upgrade to a thicker chip). Also I ordered the old timer cheese burger, this is a great burger, fresh patty I had cooked medium and would definitely order again. Overall the staff was friendly and did the best they could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore
Jen S.,"Laguna Hills, CA",606,512,3353,2.0,9/30/2017,"1st star for dining-in tableside guacamole 2nd star for the awesome cookie skillet dessert we got complimentary for a birthday bonus~ Thanks Chilis! We've tried visiting this location now on several occasions. We typically don't dine in, but did so a few weeks ago and I forgot to do a review then. Service dining in went well and our server was great and attentive at the bar. Our table can now order and pay our bills with their tablets actually, but our drinks and tableside guacamole Service still kept us content.  However, on a more recent visit this evening, and like many takeout service evenings, it's very disappointing. Hoping our critique can help improve their training. Called to place an order for guacamole, queso, chips and salsa. First call, young lady transfers us to takeout but disconnects us. Photos will display this sequence of events. Called back and we were in hold for 8+min so we hopped in the car to just drive there and for giggles stayed on the line to see if we would beat them to picking up our call. Since I wasn't driving I proceed to place my order online, rummage around emails and password retrievals, place the order online by 8:20 Sat PM and online confirmation stayed it'd be ready by 8:40. (20 min) We park and I wait in the car on hold while my guy picks up the food. End of the story I am on hold for almost 30 min. My guy exits WITH our takeout in hand before anyone even picked up the phone. It was hilarious, after all was said and done. The only saving element to our experience tonight was that logging in to our Chili's account I learned we had a birthday dessert credit and could be redeemed tonight. So, left with a delicious cookie and vanilla ice cream skillet treat. Hope their takeout service improves and take our notes to heart. Thanks!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore
Anthony S.,"Las Vegas, NV",486,26,6,5.0,1/3/2018,"My wife and I come here regularly and we've always had a great experience, but this last visit went from what could have been a bad experience to a really great one. Our appetizer was a little cold so we they offered to bring a new order without question, but it ended up coming at the same as our entree which I was bummed about, but then Mel the manager offered us the appetizer on the house and I thought that was really cool. They could have not really cared, because it wasn't that huge of a deal, but they went out of their way to make sure their customers were satisfied and that's rare to find in restaurants these days.

Yolanda R.,"Murrieta, CA",37,7,,1.0,12/31/2017,Let me start by saying that chili's is one of my favorite restaurants but this location in lake elsinore is not a good place to eat. My husband and I had the worst experience. We ordered the fries and cheese jalapeno appetizer and it was over cooked and left solid as a rock. So we asked them to exchange it for the traditional cheese and chips appetizer and that was awful. We should of got up and left but we didnt. We said maybe the steak meal will be delicious like at all the other chili's restaurants. We were served 2 sirloin steaks with their loaded mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. My steak was not done the way I asked so it was taken back to cook a little longer and it got burnt. The mashed potatoes were very dry on both plates and broccoli was barely steamed. We will not be going to this location ever again. Also the restaurant was very dusty where we were sitting the wall between the booths were very dusty like they haven't been cleaned for weeks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore

My husband still has his favorites on the menu, however mine have left. The Southwest salad is gone; the Chicken, bacon, avocado sandwich is available but the pretzel roll is gone. I like the salmon but only like it broiled, not with all the sauces and spices. The Chili's in Lake Elsinore will accommodate me, however, in Hemet, I have to scrape off the spices they cook on the salmon plus they don't cook it done enough for me and no matter how many times I have asked them, they still cook it ""their"" way.

When I first moved to Lake Elsinore 4 years ago I went here to eat. The food was terrible, the service was terrible and it was just an overall bad experience. I thought maybe it was just a bad day that we all have. So I went there again the following week. The same terrible experience. Then a few months ago after not being back for a few years I took my two young sons there to eat since we couldn't figure anything else out. I was expecting the same poor service and bad food. To my surprise the service was great and so was the food. The servers and I assume managers or hosts kept checking in on us to make sure we had everything we needed and to do if we were satisfied with our meals. Was a great experience. Today, decided to give it another try. So I went out on a limb and took my girlfriend and her daughter there because they have a decent kid friendly menu. Again, the service was great and the food was good. I don't know what happened to make them turn around for the better but whatever it was I'm glad they did.

I ordered the crispy style chicken crispers. My boyfriend liked his wings and said the the shrimp tacos were actually spicy, and he isn't weak to spicy like I am. I enjoyed my crispy chicken crispers that are served with French fries (nothing special) and corn on the cob :D Something really neat at Chili's is this little touch screen device they have on all the tables called a Ziosk. You can play games on it (for a fee). You can cruise drinks, desserts & appetizers on it and you can pay your check on it!  We noticed that the ""watermelon"" lemonade hadn't been removed from the bill, my boyfriend mentioned it to the waiter and he took it off. We decided to pay using the Ziosk. The Ziosk also prints out your receipt!  All in all not a bad evening :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=60
Bret G.,"Perris, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/21/2015,Came to have dinner...watch the game and maybe grab a drink... Walked in to dirty plates sitting on the table and everyone just walking past us like they had no desire to clean them away. .bartender grabbed them and moved it across to the other side of the bar (still there 20 minutes later)  Then when i  ask for a menu she informs me everything i need to order is on the computer which has nothing on it..not to mention it was sticky and stuck to the counter.. Finally i get a menu from her and it's covered in food...SeriouSly chick clean your menu!! Let's move onto ordering drinks...one beer one pineapple  margarita...two dirty glasses...handed to us by the top of the glass where she expects our mouths to go...um no bitch not happening.  At this point Im done.  I'm not a fancy girl or high maintenance but i would like a clean glass and place to sit. After all those rolled up into not wanting anything at all from that place we decided to speak to a manager about not paying for our drinks we didnt touch and leave.   We waited 15 minutes for a manager to inform us that he was understaffed tonight and he was sorry and we were welcome to leave in his most smart ass wanna be punched in the throat voice. I know this will fix nothing...but it made me feel better. Now off to someplace far better!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=60

Along the way several tables including  a large table were full of dirty dishes and no one seemed to care as they walked by of the condition  of the  dirty tables. Waiter came introduced himself, took drink order and walked off, since beverages ordered were non alcoholic, it seemed to take a bit before he returned. Restaurant did not appear busy yet. Waiter then asked if we were ready to order, we asked for a couple minutes, he returned took our order, and then we never saw him again, other servers brought our food. I ordered the ribs much to my disappointment they were lacking meat but slathered in barbecue sauce, the asparagus was thin and very unappetizing.  My son's burger was dry and not once were our beverages checked. We had to ask for our check.

Charlie C.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/2/2016,"The husband and I wanted to stay local so we decided to go to Chilis.  The service here is usually ok, nothing to rave about but decent. Well Saturday night service was awful. It started when we were seated. The waitress was in a super rush taking our drink order and when the blackberry iced teas came out, they tasted awful. She did what she could to make the drinks right so I figured no big deal. We ordered an appetizer and shortly afterwards we ordered our meals. The appetizer came out just fine and my husband, daughter and I enjoyed it. Well then the real issues came about. We sat for at least 45 minutes and our actual meals still hadn't come out. My husband flagged down the waitress to find out what the hold up was. She went to check and came out with my daughters food (kids corn dog meal) which was piping hot that she couldn't even eat it. At this point I'm just pissed. They obviously put a rush on the kids meal or else why was it so hot? I think they forgot to put our order in. Well I flagged down the waitress and asked her to call the manager over to our table. When the manager came over he apologized for the delay and said the food would be out shortly. I mean he did try to make it right, I'm not going to lie. But at that point it was well close to an hour and our food still hadn't come out. He said he was going to take care of the bill for us and asked if we wanted our food to go. I was so done I didn't want any food to go. I just wanted to get out of there and honestly I wasn't even hungry anymore . I've worked in a restaurant before so I am usually extremely understanding when it comes to kitchen screw ups or wait staff issues but the thing is I had to flag down our waitress to find out where our food was. She should have come over and explained and apologized for the delay before I asked to speak to a manager. Oh and we also noticed that two parties that were sat after us, were done and leaving because they had already eaten. And here we were still waiting for our food.  Needless to say, we won't be coming back here anytime soon. I would rather make the drive to the Murrieta location where we have always had good service.

When walking in a host was holding the door for us.  After we walked in we were seated right away. Our server came up quickly and asked for our drink orders and then gave us some time to look over the menu. I noticed at that point they didn't give my son a kid menu. So my son went up and got one on his own. Our server came back and took our order and we had an issue with that tablet thing at our table (our kids wanted to play and it didn't work). Our server then reset it and soon after our apetizer came out. Soon after that our food came out.  The food was great as usual. No complaints in that department.  Although it did take awhile for our plates to be cleared. and we did get to go boxes. We ended up paying at the table on the tablet.  My only issue with this visit, while the the service was there and the employees have all the technical skills to do their job. I think they are lacking the soft skills. There wasn't any personal service at all. We did leave a nice tip (we always do). I just think this visit, like all my visits there, was mediocre.  The tablet thing wasn't explained very well and we were only table touched maybe three times throughout our visit.

Anna R.,"Corona, CA",0,9,12,1.0,5/23/2015,"I wish I could give no stars, came in with the family for dinner after my baby sister's first communion and there were multiple mistakes made throughout the dinner. First, the waiter forgot to ask me what I wanted to drink so I waited while my other family members have received their drink and everytime I would try to ask the waiter would turn away. Second, my mom's ribeye was well done when she asked for medium rare and they took it back but when she got the new one after we were all done eating her new one was very rare. Third, my baby sister's steak was medium rare when hers should've been medium well but she was hungry so we let it off. Lastly, we paid through the new kiosk that they had on the table and still gave the waiter a 10% tip even after all of the mistakes and it said to ""pay & go"" so after we paid and printed our receipt we left but the waiter chases after us out of the door and sternly asks us if we paid already, my dad was upset and said, ""we paid through the kiosk, do we look like we would not pay for our dinner?"" And she argues back and takes the receipt from my mom's hand and takes it in with her, while we were walking away she yelled, ""Ya, runaway, runaway!""  Very disappointed with the service and will never ever go back to another Chili's, the food is not even that good. Another thing, they said they would take off my mom's ribeye steak for the trouble but still kept it on the receipt but we decided to just pay for it anyway.

I ordered the 10oz sirloin RARE came out Well Done same with my wife's (keep in mind Valentines Day, which should be special not messed up) The manager came over (John) very politely apologized for the mistake and said they would redo our meal and it should be another 5-7 minutes. Well, it wasn't. How about another 40-minutes. About now I'm pissed. The meal finally comes my wife's 6oz Sirloin is perfect a nice small thick steak done rare and me I get the 10oz thin Sirloin steak done medium...Arraguah! Normally when you order a rare steak it's not a thin cut because it's harder to cook it rare and they failed to make it rare. The manger John said we'll comp your whole meal and again apologized and said when you're done get a dessert on us as well. How nice? So the waitress jokingly said she'd place the dessert order and GUESS WHAT???? Another 25-plus minute wait. Okay it was free and we will always remember Valentines Day at Chili's.

Rhonda S.,"Sun City, CA",0,9,,2.0,2/2/2017,Me and a friend went to Chili's after work on Tuesday 1-31-17. What a mistake wish I would had went somewhere else. First didn't get half of my meal Order was incorrect AND then when the first half came out the Fries were stone cold. Finally order saying something to the waiter which didn't even notice was the wrong meal he went back to the kitchen and the rest of the meal came out and actually some warm fries came out with it. Inadequate service and Poor food. Asked to speak to the Manager and was told he would come out AFTER waiting over 10 minutes he didn't appear so I told the gentlemen that said he would be out to forget it obviously he didn't care to speak to a customer.

The server was so unprofessional and even treated us like we didn't know what we were talking about. It took us 2 hours to get the food and pay the bill. That's way too long! The only one that had their shit together was the man who delivered the food. He had a good attitude and was very precise in his delivery. Chili's used to be great.

The current manager needs to be thrown out on his face and the original brought back! Once again, a Lake Elsinore business crumbling to the ground because they just don't care! Best if you go to another location, because Chili's food, when it's hot is delicious. Problem is, this place no longer knows how to serve it that way. Given all these reviews, evidently the District Manager is a ""Yes"" man and doesn't have a backbone or a heart. I had to stand by a dirty table in the bar for over 5 minutes before it got cleaned. The waitress came by in a reasonable amount of time to take my drink order and then took almost 15 minutes to bring it. The food was another excruciatingly long wait and was only warm when it got there. If you don't care about your time or food, this is the place for you.

In a town starving for good restaurants, it was nice to know you could count on Chilis Lake Elsinore. They used to cook my burger a perfect medium rare, but the past two times, even after my reminding them when ordering and pleading with the server to get it right, the burger was dry and waaaay over cooked. Yeah they offered to redo it, but that's not reasonable when your wife is already eating and you have time limitations. A restaurant needs to get it right the first time.  So we went back a week later after one bad meal because they promised it wouldn't happen again but it did, so I'm done with Chilis. On a separate visit at the bar, they also blew it. They don't know how to make a Long Island Ice Tea. Tasted horrible, after I sent two back, I gave up .

Fitness to put back on all the fat I had just burned off.  And that usually means a good time. But this time, I may have gotten sick there.  I had their ""All you can eat soup and salad"" and ice tea.  (Usually, I have a few beers, but I'm trying!)  I had two bowls of Terlingua Chili and two salads with vinegarette dressing. While eating the chili, I chewed on a piece of meat that just wasn't right.  I didn't want to spit it out in front of my date, and frankly, I was afraid of what I might find, so I just swallowed it and prayed that it was just the bottom of the pot.  Well, by the end of the night, I'm not feeling too well.  You know, I couldn't get too far away from a bathroom? Now I know that it is hard to prove, but I had cereal for breakfast with toast that had honey and peanut butter on it.  Chilis was lunch.  And I just had noodles for dinner, but symptoms started too soon after that.  I can't prove in court that it was Chilis' chili, but suffice it to say, I won't be eating that again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=120

If you have children you can authorize a .99 cent charge on the computer thing they have on the tables to unlock games, but beware, if there isn't one on your table they still charge you. No big deal it's a dollar but they should be more attentive. The food is ok I've been in 3 times and one the food was over salted, second the food was cold, third the food was bland. The prices are $$ so since the service is bad, the wait is horrible, you expect at least the food to be delicious.

I never go alone and whomever is dining with me almost always has an issue with their food as well. As for the service, no one is great over there.

When the food came out, the waitress asked my boyfriend to cut into the steak to make sure it was cooked the way he wanted. Well when he cut it, it was pure raw meat. So gross! Looked like it jumped from the freezer to his plate. Blood from the meat was coming out on his mashed potatoes and broccoli. We told the manager who was not very attentive, but the waitress got him a new plate. When it came time to pay, I asked if there would be some kind of discount or something, because my and my boyfriends appetite was completely ruined after seeing this bloody piece of raw meat. The waitress went to ask the manager and came back to tell us that the best she could do was $4 off.

I've been to so many restaurants where my drink is empty and they just stroll by not noticing or they are never around when you need something and I just leave unhappy. not her she's on top everything and is what you want as a server! Thank you Scottie for being so good at what you do.  I've never had a problem with their food and I love the deals they promote.  I think the service defiantly makes the restaurant.. Some places I just hate going to because I know I will have horrible service. I will be looking for this server every time I eat at chilies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=140
Mizv R.,"SUN CITY, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/15/2012,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced.  Julia, the manager needs a class in management and customer service.  My partner and I waited over an hour for our meal and when it arrived it was incorrect.  I had to have mine packed up and then I had to throw it away because it sat in the car for too long while I attended an appointment.  Never ever will I go back to this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=140
Nikki D.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",95,8,,1.0,6/24/2013,"I don't write reviews very often, but I felt like taking the time to write a review about this place. Went there with my husband, sister, brother-in-law, and 3 nieces; we got there around 7:30/8pmish. It was after the dinner rush, but since it was happy hour Sunday we sat in the bar area. My husband and I did the 2 for $20 and so did my sister and her husband. The 2 for $20 is an appetizer and 2 meals. I also ordered a side salad. We waited for quite some time, and then finally after my husband got up looking for our waitress and asked the waitress where our appetizers and salad were, then they were brought out, BUT what followed them were our meals. The table was bombarded with plates and food and we wanted to eat our appetizers first which then made all of us eat our dinner cold. We expressed our irritation to the waitress and the runners but of course nothing but and ""oh sorry"" was done. At this time the manager should have come out without us even having to ask to check up since we very much so expressed our irritation. Another problem, the 3 nieces had kid meals and the waitress never brought out their soda's, so again my husband went back to find her and told her that she forgot, and she came back with an attitude saying that we never told her to bring them soda. I heard my brother-in-law tell her to bring them sodas. Both my sister and I used to waitress at a different Chili's when we were younger and this by far was the worst we have experienced from them. Typically the highest/best server works the bar area and this server acted as if it was her first night. She obviously didn't put the food orders in correctly and caused all the food to come out at once. Which is fine, I get it we are human, but make up for it. Tell the Manager what you did, apologize for your mistake, and make up for your lousy service. To top off the experience, I called my sister just now to ask how she was because both my husband and I had stomach issues (reason why I decided to write the review) and her and her husband and kids also had stomach issues! Save yourself the stomach bug and horrible service and try either another Chili's or Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=140

Ray F.,"Sun City, CA",1,26,2,1.0,1/4/2015,"Their food tastes like they accidentally spilled salt in it. I had a salad with buffalo chicken in it that was inedible. My understanding of how Chilis restaurants work is they don't actually make the food from scratch but it is shipped to the restaurants and re-heated, so the buffalo chicken probably was just fried there. My guess is it's over salted in all Chilis restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=100

Somer C.,"Corona, CA",91,26,4,2.0,7/9/2014,"Only giving it 2 stars because of the nice Server that took over when the HORRIBLE one's shift was over (thank goodness)!!!  We arrived and the hostess told us we can sit in the bar.  Ok.  Not busy at all but I guess she was too lazy to walk us to a table.  It was not a question as to whether we preferred to sit there, but just....""sit there"". Once we walked over to the bar there was one clean table.  There was other empty...just filthy.  The one table did not accommodate our party, so I asked the hostess to clean the table.   After being seated for about 10 min I had to get up and ask the hostess if there was a server there, because not only had Noone helped us, I had not seen ANY server in the bar at all.  After the hostess hunted down the server we asked the server what was the specials for happy hour that the hostess had mentioned.   Blank stare was all we got then told us it was on the new ziosk tablet they now have.  So we had to read it for ourselves which must not have been convenient for her either since she asked if we wanted more time.  Uhhhhh NO!  I was afraid we would never see her again.  So we ordered our drinks and a couple appetizers so we would not starve just in case she disappeared.  Enter new waitress with our appetizers.  Other lady never came back as guessed.  She introduced her self and let us know other lady was going home.  Whooo Hoooo!  Troubles over?  Heck no!  The table side guacamole was served with hard, unripe avacados.  I asked for a new one just as the Flatbread cane out.   Finally I can eat...NOPE...raw dough on the flatbread!  Sent that back.  We did get a decent guacamole and the flavor was pretty good after that.  We decided to order dessert and had the cookie and ice cream thing.  We ordered two.  Took a while to get them,  and when they came....guess what?????  RAW!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=100
Jessica S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",6,24,5,4.0,8/19/2014,The only reason I give this place 4 stars is... I've been here more than a few times and it's either a 3 star experience or a 5.  With that said... The 5 star experience-service was excellent. Very much on top of everything and never waited for anything. They were so sweet from the front door to the table. The food-awesome. I remember hating chilis because of the food. Definitely picked up their game. Everything my family and I ordered was delicious.  The 3 star experience-the food. Still DELICIOUS. You can't beat the chips n gauc. Every item we ordered on the menu again was superb. The only downfall? The service- but I don't blame the servers. I blame the management for not staffing accordingly. I went with my family on a random Wednesday night and the place was full (as it should be!) but there was only two servers in the bar (as it seemed) with no busser. I feel they did as well as they could but they couldn't keep up with the business flow. That's what happens when you step up your game chilis! Staff for it and the business will continue :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=100
Keith J.,"Sun City, CA",0,13,,1.0,11/25/2013,"UPDATE 2/28/2015: (Our original review 11/25/2013 below still stands, beware.) Terrible wait (lunch on Saturday). (May be an overloaded kitchen, but service is STILL sluggish.)  And a ripoff now! ""Half Rack Ribs"" is pathetic: 4 puny/skimpy  ""piglet"" ribs with some basted potato chunks, but no vegetable, no slaw or salad. Well, the ice tea was okay but refills slow to come. They want you to use this funky monitor touch-screen on the table to order. No way; a real server has answers and recommendations but this dumb TV-thing is an insult. Perhaps Chili's is trying to increase profits by paying servers less, or maybe wanting to look cool with a little computer screen on each table. (I turned it away facing the wall and demanded real service!) ================================= PREVIOUS 11/25/2013  REVIEW: IMPORTANT! This review is for one particular lunch at Chili's. We live close by and thus visit Chili's often, usually satisfactory but not remarkable, like some of the bar-restaurants in town are. Firstly; the downer experience on 11/13/13. The waiter was totally inattentive. (""John"" perhaps was his name?) He was mostly in the kitchen scamming on the lady waitresses. Totally indifferent, uninterested, even arrogant when we ordered a single lunch combo plus an extra salad, and a couple of Iced teas. No alcohol, minimum bill. None of those ""designer"" cutsie-spendy items on the menu. So I guess he figured it would be a ""Duh"" tip so that's what we got: ""Duh"" service. Painfully slow. Usually lunch at most places is fast, since many folks have work to return to or other business planned for the afternoon. It seems to be vogue these days for restaurants like Chili's to put servers in ""teams"" of two. Presumably to streamline service.  Amusing since the only time we saw the ""partner"" lady was when I finally went to the kitchen door and asked for the bill, and everyone snapped to! Now the best part. ""John"" padded our bill. He added some kind of designer fruit drink. (Is Chili's on a kind of quota system?) Instead of $17, it came to about $20. When asked, ""John"" said ""Oh, my finger must have slipped."" First time EVER I've left a  zero tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=100

Greg B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",23,24,,5.0,8/30/2014,"Finally writing this. Well it was two days ago but who could forget a spectacular turn around for Chili's. I never really ate there before the last year or so. After going to Chili's in Moreno Valley and having terrible food, rude, delayed, wrong items service and the manager doing nothing to correct it really, we decided that Chili's can kick rocks. According to friends in MoVal it has not gotten any better with the staff that that location even after the last year of cooling off.... Now to the good part. Chili's took me at my word listened and took down the names and times. They sent me chili's bucks (lack of a better term) in the amount of $25.00 for my bad service.  We decided to give the Chili's in Lake Elsinore a shot.  Server: Scotty (she was the best) Server: Cammie (not our server but came to visit and make fun of Scotty and see how we were doing. Sarcasm heals all wounds) Manager: Jeff (he came over checked in on us and made sure Scotty was being good) Sarcasm aside they were all nice people and we all interacted great. The food was perfect, hot, on time, and the way we ordered it. They never really forgot about us or any other table as they all appear to work together at this location. Jeff and the management staff deserve a round of applause for encouraging their servers to be outgoing, friendly, and yet professional and detail oriented.  Scotty took care of all of our needs and was so funny when she saw the Chili's bucks and how much her eye got a surprised look. I explained and we both agreed that Chili's Lake Elsinore is definitely not Moreno Valley.  I wish other restaurants would realize that the staff is the face of the company. The food is second to them and that the atmosphere really does make a difference when we are paying for dinners. Lake Elsinore Chili's seems to have figured it all out. Bill was over a hundred before the discount's (chili's bucks and senior citizen for my mom) they made every effort to be the best they could after a long and semi negative day they knew nothing about. The three people mentioned in this case deserve a raise and high five.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lake-elsinore?start=100
