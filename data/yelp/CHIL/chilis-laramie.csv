Candice B.,"Wheatland, WY",1,9,,4.0,12/29/2014,"Great staff and great food!  My family went to dinner late, maybe 1 1/2 hours before closing. We were given the same great service had we been there for dinner rush. Our waiter was friendly, helped us with keeping our 1yr. Old happy. The food was wonderful, the kitchen made sure the quality was what they would like to eat. We never felt rushed, enjoyed our meal and drinks with three children. It was nice to see the staff not be in a hurry to get out of there that they would compromise the service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Connie C.,"Hesperia, CA",19,66,55,1.0,11/11/2017,"Well, great service till my old timer came out with cheese. I just can't catch a break. Not sure this place is worth the trouble. We came here due to long lines in down town. Food came out quick. Wrong but quick.... my Bf got the steak and shrimp fajitas and that is really 9 tiny shrimp and a tiny piece of meat cut into 9 tiny strips with a bunch of onions and bell peppers at best are warmed. Ugh how can you mess this up so bad? Just skip this place. Totally save the money and cook at home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Amy C.,"Lafayette, CO",114,3,1,1.0,9/22/2017,"Tried this Chilis on a Friday night for some drinks and dinner...table of 8...started out with great service and great drinks..had to send back our second round as it was undrinkable....after 50 minutes or so, our food came out cold...unfortunately there was also a hair in one of the entrees...please step it up Chilis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Kerry S.,"Laramie, WY",28,1,,1.0,8/10/2017,"We were giving Chilis another chance. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Won't happen again. We normally spend around $70 anytime the 5 of us go to dinner & that is without tip. The food is good, just like any chain. Just like most of the other posts we have read the service is horrendous. We weren't tucked away in the back, we were at a large 6 top at the front of the restaurant where we watched 7 different waiters/waitresses stand around, talk, look at their phone, anything but come & see what we would like to drink. As we were leaving they meekly apologized. DON'T GO THERE. When you go out to dinner you pay for an experience & good food. Give your money to an establishment that takes care you. And to top it off we drove from outside of Laramie to eat there because the kids love it, very unfortunate this had to happen again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Susan C.,"Placentia, CA",8,3,,1.0,5/1/2017,"Horrible!  Came for lunch.  Not busy at all. Absolutely NO ONE could take the time to even seat 5 of us!  Very sad situation  hate giving a bad review but after waiting for 30 minutes, we gave up and left!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Stephanie S.,"Bend, OR",0,27,9,4.0,5/18/2017,"Great lunch, excellent service, good prices, clean establishment. We came here for lunch during a freak storm (stuck in Laramie for a couple of days until I80 opens again). Our server, Rachel was friendly, courteous and very attentive. Our food came out within 7 minutes which was awesome because we had our hungry lil toddler with us. The food was better than I expected. Also everyone working here seemed super friendly wish I could say that about the customers (the women who was upset she was waiting 20 minutes before anyone came and proceeded to make a nasty remark about the girls working here only having a 2.0 GPA. Btw she and her friend came in after us and was waiting only 9 minutes not 20. Sad my hungry 2 1/2 year old has better manners and patience than most adults these days. Lady learn to calm down and don't put people down...what kind of example are you setting?).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Megan W.,"Laramie, WY",20,3,,1.0,8/24/2017,This is probably the worst restaurant in town. Never have I had a good meal there and the manager Andy is very rude to customers and his employees. I will never be returning to this location again unless something changes with the menu and the management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
J A.,"Casper, WY",0,9,2,2.0,8/9/2017,"I gave Chili's another chance, unfortunately i must have given that 2nd Chance too soon!  No hostess still, waited 5 min to even be acknowledged by any staff, while several walked past. 2 of them were on their phones in the bar area.  Once seated we noticed the floors were not clean and a little sticky right in front of our table, as well as our table had sticky spots. I told the waitress and she seemed a little annoyed having to wipe the table.  When she came back 10min later, she was friendly and attempted to answer my questions about the 3 course meal deal.  The waitress although her attitude was improved she obviously didn't understand the concept of courses, 2 of the courses were served together and then forgot about the 3rd course twice!  We ended up getting the desert course to go because we had been there already close to 2 hours.   The only improvements that seemed to be made was in the bar and kitchen. My cocktail was great and husbands beer was ice cold.  The food was a delight, exactly what you expect from any Chili's location.  I hope that management is able to correct the rest of the issues, however i will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Cody W.,"Sheridan, WY",1,10,,2.0,3/11/2016,"Get your happy hour facts straight, please. Signs say 4-7, yet I am told that happy hour only lasts until 6. ??? Okay then. Also, who doesn't have piña coladas? I mean, what is this Canada?? Anyhow, service was splendid, but restaurant chain was not. I will be taking my business to Applebee's from now on. Tata chile P.S. CHILE'S SUCKS MAJOR NUTS",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Steve E.,"Fairbanks, AK",0,13,1,5.0,6/7/2016,"My steak looked exactly like the picture on the menu.  The chef delivered it on a ""crackling"" hot pan. He asked me to cut it open to see if it was cooked to my satisfaction. It was perfect. I'm impressed.  Kassidy took good care of me at the bar. Super service and great desert recommendation. I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Spencer K.,"Laramie, WY",0,6,,4.0,6/16/2017,"The food here is really good. The tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole are a fantastic inexpensive appetizer. The service is average, although I have only been here when it's busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Momma B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,90,26,1.0,6/24/2016,"Ok, I have to run and get something for my heartburn now!  Good grief!  EVERYTHING on my plate was bathed in pepper!  My tongue is burning and now I dread my sleep tonight as I am going to be tainted with a bout of serious heartburn.  Help!  I also had to have two different dishes brought to me as the first one had a hair in it!  Disgusting.  I should have trusted my better judgement and not come to eat here.  Might I add...that even after the hair I still had to pay for my meal.  Will not return, even if my son does go to school here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Steve T.,"Rock Springs, WY",0,1,,2.0,5/15/2016,Food was good.  Service was poor.  Had to get the manager to get our waitresses.  She rarely checked on us and it took 35 minutes to be served a salad. Needs some improvement before I go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Julie V.,"Canton, KS",16,19,1,2.0,7/18/2016,We went later on a Sunday evening. We had to wait even though there were tables open.  The server was very nice and did a good job serving us.  But it took a long time to get food.  The food was like any other Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Lindsay S.,"Carr, CO",0,16,14,3.0,6/18/2014,"I come here a lot. My food has always been consistently good especially for casual dining. Courtney was my server this time. She did a great job and was very friendly.  This is a good place for kids. Highchairs, free sippy cup, changing table in restroom, etc. Try one of their  pizza appetizers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Ashleigh T.,"Laramie, WY",56,7,,2.0,4/9/2016,"We went in for my grandmothers birthday, there was 7 of us, we all wanted a drink, my grandmother ordered a Coors original, they brought us a Coors light, the waitress didn't know the difference. We watched all the servers stand around  talk about their night partying then actually working! Food was okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Rae M.,"Dallas, TX",7,12,5,5.0,9/17/2015,"Best service I have ever received at any chilis ever. I came in with a huge team and they were more than accommodating. One of my teammates ordered the cookie and they were out so they gave her a free brownie, they kept our chips and drinks filled and checked up on us! Food was normal, but what would keep me coming back would be service. Kassidy was our servers name!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Gustave A.,"Elwell, MI",11,29,15,1.0,8/8/2015,"Once again a really disappointing visit. It took 14 minutes to get our drinks after being seated, another 12 to get the appetizer we ordered with our drinks. Food finally arrived a shocking 58 minutes after we arrived. Server just said sorry couldn't even pick up the empty plates from the table. Manager never stopped by to apologize or see what was going on. Dive another 1/4 mile up the street to Applebee's where the food is better and the service is solid!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Jennifer C.,"Rock Springs, WY",0,2,,1.0,9/15/2014,We couldn't even get seated. The staff was busy drawing with chalk in the parking lot while one guy stayed inside and played on his cellphone in the corner. I can't say much about the food since we walked out but I have a feeling we would have been lucky to get our drinks,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
Don C.,"Laramie, WY",2,3,,1.0,5/24/2013,"Slow, inattentive waitstaff. Food took well over an hour to arrive. Was only given one refill all evening. Salad was filled with brown, rotting lettuce. Avocado was poorly peeled resulting in skin chunks left on it. Guacamole had turned brown. Overall, save your sanity and go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie
S B.,"Cheyenne, WY",2,114,19,2.0,8/24/2014,Typical Chili's food but the place is not great.  Staff is slow and ignored us when we went there.  You would think being so close to the stadium they would work harder but no.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie?start=20
Tom J.,"Riverton, WY",2,31,,4.0,2/3/2013,Food was good. Staff was great. Host was the best and was very helpful for a busy Sat. Night getting our party of six seated. Great for a chain restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie?start=20
Joe J.,"Denver, CO",68,474,93,1.0,11/1/2011,"Poor quality food.  Of the two times I've eaten here, two times I've had to find a bathroom 45 minutes post-dining.  Yeap, its like clockwork.  Right off the top of my head, I can think of 7 better places to dine in Laramie.  Avoid this place if possible.  I don't need to say anything more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie?start=20
Carol M.,"Kampong Pasir Ris, Singapore",1,226,2,1.0,9/16/2011,"Greasy food, overcooked, no real service...go to 17th street grill....Chilis  has been open for 3 years and is consistently terrible...true waste of money....DO NOT BOTHER YOU ARE BETTER AT MCDONALDS",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie?start=20
Vincent I.,"Kansas City, KS",0,3,,1.0,3/20/2013,"Poor service, I went there a couple of times and received the same service each time. The drinks are watered down. The staff jokes around and are not very professional. Will not be returning",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-laramie?start=20
