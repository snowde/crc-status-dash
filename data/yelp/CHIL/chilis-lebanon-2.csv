Brenda S.,"Birmingham, AL",0,5,,4.0,11/10/2017,The great thing about chains is that you know what you're going to get.   Up the middle good.   Decent TeX mex food.   I like the beer specials!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Rachel W.,"Des Plaines, IL",94,590,1474,2.0,9/2/2016,This place is just as bad as the Ruby Tuesday in Lebanon. Food was so salty.  Bathrooms and kitchen were horribly dirty. I'm not sure why they keep the entryway to their kitchen open. Anyone returning from the (disgusting) restrooms can see right into the kitchen and the mess of food all over the floor. Omg. Scummy and wasteful.  2/5 for the service.  Would never come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Jim L.,"Lebanon, TN",81,6,3,1.0,5/27/2017,My family and I were there tonight and we were served the appetizer queso dip and I believe it was spit in. There was a white bubble substance floating in one spot.  I I'll not be returning and I would urge others not to go to this location.  We left before dinner could be served.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Camilla J.,"Lebanon, TN",77,163,780,1.0,1/13/2017,"I keep coming back here because its convenient close, but its like playing roulette... There is no way to know if you are going to get good food or good service. I have had everything from 1 star to four start treatments here, food is 1-3 stars depending on which day you show up. The last visit we had was the worst.... we promised each other to NOT come back for a long while. We waited for a table, was supposed to be 5-10 mins it was almost 25, and right there we should have known better... When the wait is that long and you see a lot of open tables = problems in the kitchen. Finally got a table. Watch our waitress walk buy picking up trash at other tables for 15 mins before we waved her in to at least get something to drink. We were three people ordering nothing difficult, but the food still took another 30 minutes. By the time the food arrived we were SO hungry (we were not offered any bread or chips or anything, add up the time we arrived at the door...VERY hungry). We would have eaten almost anything by now, but believe it or not two of our dishes were COLD! Only the flat bread pizza was warm. We asked to talk to the manager, he was very busy we were told, but he finally came out and talked to my husband, I had already left. The manager said they had not enough staff in the kitchen, that still doesn't explain why two dishes were served cold... We paid for the pizza and took it with us and went to McDonalds instead.  Should have just gone to MDs in the first place :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Angela B.,"Carthage, TN",45,9,44,2.0,11/3/2016,This is the best place to eat for lunch but after 3 pm the service sucks...couldn't get drinks food nothing waited too long,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Danielle P.,"Nashville, TN",0,10,,5.0,6/2/2017,"My family and I ate here last night and it was so great! There was a total of 7 people and even with such a large party our food was prompt, accurate, and delicious! My sister-in-law actually accidentally threw her retainers away. BUT our waitress, along with the manager, were kind enough to search for them. They found the retainers and we were all just so grateful for her great customer service. She really went above and beyond to make sure she did all she could to find them! We'll surely be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Jason B.,"Kailua, HI",39,1,3,5.0,5/21/2017,Greta place to eat whenever u want nice people and parking never seems to be a problem here. Get seated quick and even quicker to get your drinks and food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Jeff P.,"La Vergne, TN",0,13,,3.0,4/26/2017,"We found the service to be the best in town. The only reason for the three star is they were out of Ribs. The home of the Babyback rib song was out of ribs! So I tried the Buffalo style chicken tenders with blu cheese. The tenders we okay but they had three chees crumbles and only a small drizzle of buffalo sauce so I basically had ordinary tenders. The food was hot so the rest of my party was pleased and our server was tremendous, but you cant run out of your signature item and expect great ratings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
S S.,"Lebanon, TN",0,2,,1.0,7/14/2017,"My family generally likes Chili's, but this restaurant in particular has gone downhill over the last several months. Everything from the little computer pods on the tables to the bathrooms were extremely dirty. Disgusting actually. I ordered ribs of all things, at Chili's, and they came out bone cold. Whatever is happening at this restaurant I hope they address, soon. We'll start going to the Mt. Juliet location until there is improvements.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Chris T.,"Cookeville, TN",2,10,9,2.0,9/17/2015,"Visited the location at approximately 9:35 PM. We were not greeted with hospitality and it took about 4 minutes for a hostess to actually come up front to seat us. We placed our drink orders and then our meal. During our hour stay the waitress visited our table for a refill 1 time. I actually had to get up and walk over to her to request a to-go box and the bill. I could understand if the establishment was busy, but there may have been 5 other tables besides ours. On top of the slow service, the wait staff left tables and the bar area unattended instead of clearing them after customers left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Gabrielle T.,"New York, NY",8,29,2,5.0,1/15/2017,"I'm mostly writing this review to counter the bad ones, as I've had numerous great experiences at this Chili's. I typically do not write reviews for chain restaurants, but anything I've ordered from here is delicious and the servers have been polite, friendly, and accommodating. Admittedly I order to-go from here more than dine-in. I have been to numerous other chains in Lebanon and have left disappointed every time. However, this Chili's location has been the only positive dining experience my husband and I have had at sit-down chain restaurants in the area. I recommend the steak from the ""lighter options"" portion of the menu. It's fantastic with the salad that comes with it. Will keep coming back! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Liam F.,"Lebanon, TN",0,1,,1.0,4/24/2016,Food cold took an hour and an half for our food and they were creepy and it was so cold,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Benjamin L.,"Hermitage, TN",0,3,,3.0,6/20/2016,I like the food here and I was craving the ribs because they put pictures of it everywhere and when I asked for it they said quote we are out unquote. I was pissed. So I ordered something else and it was ok. Next time have ribs CHILIS which you are known for goddamnit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Chelsea H.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,3,,1.0,7/24/2015,"Absolutely terrible experience. First of all, we walked in with 3 hungry kids and were told a 20 minute wait. A cursory glance through the restaurant spotted at least 5-6 empty tables ( some cleaned off others not). After about 15 plus minutes we went inside to wait. I looked around and counted at least 10 empty tables and there were at least 4 parties waiting besides us. I asked if those were reserved for some reason. Hostess said, "" um, no."" So we wait another 5 minutes before getting out table. Server was ok. But after ordering our food ( again 3 kids), we waited at least an hour for food... Salads, Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, etc. not hard food to prepare). By this time we went through 3 baskets of chips just waiting. By the time the food came it was mediocre at best. My daughter wouldn't even eat the Mac and cheese ( and they eat everything Mac and cheese all the time). We were so tired and full of chips that most of us didn't even finish the meal. Absolutely worst dining experience we have had in ages ( if ever).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Josh D.,"Pennington Gap, VA",0,2,,1.0,7/30/2016,"We were traveling on interstate I-40 and decided to take an exit to grab some lunch.  Well, I wish we made a different decision.  We were seated, then we had to wait 20 minutes for our server.  When he finally came over he began to take our order.  As I begin to speak, he interrupted me and said he had something on his shirt then walked away to clean it.  We had to wait another few minutes for him to return.  We finally were able to give him our order.  When he finally brought out our appetizer (chips and salsa) the chips were mostly crumbs and not whole chips to dip in the salsa which by the way was thin as water. They weren't abnormally busy but it took appx. 30-40 mins for our food to arrive at our table.  The actual quality of the entrees were below average for chilis including my corn on the cob was cold and had no seasoning and the hot portions of the entrees weren't hot. While we were eating, I had to flag down another chilis employee to ask for something because our server wasn't attentive.  After that he finally came to check on us and wasn't very friendly.  I enjoy other chilis that I have visited, however this was one of the worst dining out experiences that I've had in a long time.  We felt as if we weren't a priority and overall were very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Brian C.,"Nashville, TN",1498,241,2047,5.0,6/14/2011,"An excellent experience!  Being on a diet, I was concerned about calorie count.  The manager went WAY above the call to dig up the counts and actually highlight them all for me. The food was amazing.  The service would shame of some Nashville's finest restaurants.  Given a choice, I'm driving to this Chili's in the Greater Nashville area for this brand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Fatima I.,"Lebanon, TN",0,2,,1.0,8/6/2014,"We ordered the $20 dinner for 2. We got the onion strings jalapeño appetizer, which was horrible and greasy. I ordered the quesadilla and the bacon burger, which is taking a long time to be served to us. Food finally came, the bacon burger was very bland and my quesadillas I thought they were very greasy.  Service was just ok. I haven't been to a Chillis in a while, and the last one I was at was a lot better than this one here.  I won't be coming back for sure,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
angela t.,"Lebanon, TN",0,22,16,4.0,10/6/2014,"I love This chilies! I've always had great servers and good food for the most part. I come here often.. A wonderful lunch menu. Love the chips and salsa!  The only reason I can't give it 5 starts is for the few times they get my order wrong or making me wait forever for a refill on my drink or simply not getting me a refill at all... Picky? Maybe, but I paid 3 bucks for that drink and it's mostly ice so yes, I want refills and I shouldn't have to ask for them. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Stan R.,"Lebanon, TN",0,11,,2.0,8/4/2014,"Service is lagging and they weren't busy, We arrived around 330 and hostess seated us in the bar which had only two men at a table. The waitress arrived and asked for drink orders. I ordered a tea but wanted it In a go cup, but large not child's go cup which I was given the last time. I guess $3 tea has to be pondered over because it took her awhile to respond. After we received our fajitas we had to ask for plates, but that took awhile since the waitress was busy talking to the hostess. My husband received a tsp of cheese with his $15 dollar order and very few condiments. I think Chili's believe sour cream is finger food, because there was no spoon. Our waitress disappeared, we could see her standing behind a counter talking to another employee,  so since the hostess was staring our way we tried to get her attention. No luck, she was to involved with TV.  They noticed I was on my cellphone so the waitress did come over and looked behind my back. She did offer a refill on our drinks at that time. I have been before and had good service, but when there is no customers you think it would be better. We felt like we were intruding on their time. My husband mentioned they must not like to use plates and silverware because they don't want to wash dishes. Apparently they don't like to give you more then a tsp of cheese and finger food sour cream.  Maybe their new name should be Elcheapo Chilli's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Chris B.,"Duluth, GA",0,14,2,2.0,5/28/2014,Ok at best. I wasn't ready for the video game/electronic waiter at the table. I guess they gave up on trying to find staff that can take an order and bring food. Taking Chilis off of my visit once in a while list.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2
Andrew M.,"Philadelphia, PA",10,13,8,3.0,2/19/2012,It's a corporate chain and is consistent with other chilis. You at least know what to expect here. Good service and good food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2?start=20
Lorri H.,"Lebanon, TN",1,2,,5.0,10/28/2013,"We stopped at this restaurant on our way home. It was clean, food was as expected but Jenny was above and beyond kind, sweet,helpful and friendly! Thank you for suggesting the blackberry margarita!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lebanon-2?start=20
