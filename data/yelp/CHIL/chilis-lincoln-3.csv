Kristen A.,"Lincoln, RI",66,184,189,3.0,4/13/2016,"As far as Chili's goes, this location is OK. When you take out location as a factor, this is how I see it: PROS: The restaurant is always clean Rarely need to wait to be seated Friendly staff Can actually taste the alcohol in drinks CONS: Frequent errors w/orders - at least one every visit Inconsistent quality SLOW diner service Monday-Thursday Can often be packed with borderline obnoxious diners on Friday/Saturday nights I come back simply because it's convenient, not too pricy, & there is always something on the menu everyone likes. Not the best Chili's I've been to, but not the worse either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3
Mason S.,"Providence, RI",2,14,5,1.0,1/7/2018,"If I could give this place negative stars, it would be a negative -5.  Awful service.. upon entering, hostess made us wait only stating that it would be a few minutes.. when we asked exactly what a few minutes meant, she responded, well more like ten minutes.. meanwhile it's 2:15pm on a Sunday, and they are not busy.   Finally seated at the smallest booth on earth for two people.. ordered the trio app and a drink.. the margarita mix was spoiled and tasted mad funky, when asked to fix it, the waitress just said order a replacement, no apologies.. the second came with little/no alcohol, just mix..  The app trio was ""dropped"" by the food runner with two plates tossed on this small ass table.  The sliders where over cooked and dry with congealed cheese.. the southwestern egg rolls where dry and looked like they were sitting in a pan waiting to be freed.. they had a film on the filling.. disgusting.. the best was the fact that our apps were served, within minutes the entree was served.   Like no room on this small ass table and the runner left us literally holding the plates in the air while they took off.. the salad had quesadillas on the side, which were rock hard with congealed cheese in the center.. and the chicken waffle crispers had the most sawdust dry waffles I have ever tasted.. they were cold and dry and bland.  Did help that they served that entree wrong with incorrect sides.   The best was after this dining experience to be handed the check, and the waitress disappeared, we sat for over twenty minutes trying to exit this horror show of nightmare customer service.  Finally had to get the hostess to cash us out, and yet the waitress was still no where to be found!  AVOID CHILI'S In Lincoln!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3

Patrick M.,"North Smithfield, RI",17,67,345,2.0,10/30/2016,"So I went to Chili's the other night with some friends and it was packed so obviously the service was slow, the waitress was nice though. I got the triple dipper with the original chicken crispers which seemed different this time and the honey chipotle chicken crispers that were barely crispy. Someone at my table ordered a tex mex bowl that was supposed to have avocado in it but the waitress didn't tell us they were out of avacado until AFTER she brought us our food.

Figured the bartender when serving them to us would realize they were burnt.  She obviously ignored us, maybe she was embarrassed...when she asked if everything was ok and I said ""you can take the nachos back, they are burnt.""  She responded with ""you didn't like them?""    Sweetheart, they weren't touched....

Kelly F.,"North Providence, RI",169,309,45,2.0,12/29/2015,"No bueno. This was my favorite locations until yesterday. We usually just sit in the bar area but when we walked over, the floor was sticky, and there was a smell.... So we asked to be seated in the main dining area. The host said he had to clean off a table so we waited. When he showed us to our table, the seat was dirty and there was literally a pile of trash under the table. My husband was like ""No thanks we'll just sit here. "" So we sat at the booth across from it that was clean. I don't know how he didn't see it. Gross.  The watermelon margarita is really good. It's made with tequila, sour mix and watermelon puree. I ordered the chicken bacon quesadillas and they were a tad too greasy. The Texas fries were scrumptious. They're served in a skillet and topped with bacon and cheese. We opted for the half order. The portions are huge here. We split dessert. The toffee brownie Sunday is perfect to split. My little guy had pizza. Meh. I like you can pay at the table kiosk but was surprised at the $1.99 charge for games. No big deal but I would have rather let him use my phone had I known. Overall I feel like this place needs a really good bath. It's just dirty all at around. My kitchen with a smelly old dog and 3 guys is cleaner....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3

Laura T.,"Lincoln, RI",3,12,,3.0,1/3/2017,"I would not recommend going here unless you have a party of 5 or more. The waiters don't care.  I work right next to this Chili's so I order food from here a lot. However I have not had very many good experiences.  On 1-2-17 we had stopped in late to grab some dinner. Our waiter Adrian seemed much too distracted. It took a long time for him to come and take our drink order and even longer to bring them over. He just ran by and dropped the glasses without stopping.  It took even longer to get the check, and even thought we really wanted dessert, we were unable to order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3
Cuitlahuac G.,"Woonsocket, RI",1,25,,4.0,3/25/2017,"Decided to go out for lunch and the restaurant looked very full but we walked in and sat right down, it was surprising. I love the chips and salsa it's a solid choice. We decided to get burgers, I ordered the ""ULTIMATE"" bacon burger. The bacon wasn't ultimate I don't think it even had 1 full strip of bacon. The burgers are good I just found it funny that the bacon burger lacked bacon. I loved the strawberry lemonade and the service was on point. Didn't have to ask for a refill at all. The only down side was the lack of bacon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3
Elizabeth B.,"Lincoln, RI",1,18,4,5.0,10/15/2016,"I've been going to this Chili's consistently for the past four years. The 5 stars is because of the staff...I also have to average the amount of times the food is really good and weigh it against a couple bad experiences. We have had the same servers for years. It's nice to come in and have someone recognize you, remember your drink order or come over to say ""HI"", even when they don't have your table. I want to give a shout out to them because even though it's a chain restaurant,  it doesn't feel that way!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3
N. Z.,"Woonsocket, RI",1,90,,1.0,10/3/2015,"2nd time in three months....the food sucks there! Beans and rice served cold twice now...its like the cooks don't have the microwave down yet Very bland rice Paid an up charge for Steak and shrimp fajitas..... it was a 2.5 -3 oz piece of meat and about 6 very tiny shrimp, like baby shrimp. $16 bucks for this rip-off! I tried the new steak burrito last time. It was 3/8"" pieces of meat, about 5% of the filling, 90% rice?? It does not get any worse than this, and way, way over spiced, a piss poor formulation Soup are horrible and also served cold I had a couple decent meals a couple of years ago....and I suspect there is a GM/Manger there and kitchen manager now who just don't have the proper groove.  I walked by the kitchen it it looked chaotic. Seems like they were just slinging out the food  Just about 5 bucks for a Corona.....my wife like to go there for the Margaritas, but its time to move on.

Joanna R.,"Portland, ME",140,223,3362,4.0,12/3/2014,"It's a Chili's, a chain I know. But it's a great Chili's! I am usually here during the week for lunch and each time the service and food were prompt. I never had the anxiousness that I was going to be delayed in getting back to work. It's the little things that go a long way with me. I love as I walk up to the door there is a greeter that welcomes us and holds the door open for us :) Typically we arrive around 11:30am and I have NEVER had to wait for someone to greet us or for a table to open up. There is always the option for high tables or dining room. Once seated the servers are usually at our table in 1-2 minutes taking our drink orders. Drinks arrive within 5 minutes and usually we are not ready to provide our order,  but no worries, they don't stray too far and seem to always appear when we look up from our menus. Here is where they lose one star. For some reason, the chips tend to be overly salted or stuck together, while edible it is not necessary. If I have time, I usually ask for unsalted chips and it is worth the wait. The food times very well, as soon as we are about halfway through chips the orders arrive. My orders have always arrived as expected based on the descriptions and prepared as requested, for example, medium for a burger, is typically medium. The lunch combo menu is a great value, good quality and takes no time at all to arrive, but if you are a slow eater, you may want to pass, because it is a lot of food for lunch portions. I love the chili - they use chunk tomatoes and shredded beef and a touch of melted cheese on top. Very tasty and terrific to dip the chip appetizer in as well. For me, the quesadilla is my go to entree - chicken, bacon, ranch. Very flavorful sometimes a bit too salty, but that's rare. Refills are not a problem - the lunch staff are ninja like and very attentive. They sneak up with soda refills without us having to ask and take away empty cups and plates so it doesn't look like we are hoarding dishes. The place has only gotten better recently with the pay terminals at the table. LOVE that! You can split the bill, it has a tip meter and it prints your receipt! It really can't get any more convenient and efficient for me. I highly recommend this place for a work lunch. I know, the staff and food keep us coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3
Gina B.,"Raleigh, NC",234,334,,2.0,6/30/2014,"I had a mixed bag experience at this Chili's unfortunately. I'm gluten and garlic free so I came in and sat at the bar and chatted thru the menu with the waiter. We worked out a plan on what to order and he was very helpful and mixed up a delicious drink. Unfortunately, when the meal came, it wasn't to speck. He quickly, and without request, comped the meal. Very kind of him. I wasn't quite full, so I ordered a dessert. This seemed to take forever to get the cheesecake and the original order.  I thought he did a pretty good job trying to take care of the situation, but the kitchen wasn't doing him any favors. I'll try them again if I'm in Smithfield, but hopefully the order is prepared correctly without any allergic substances on my plate ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3

They jip you on food so bad and the new spice they use is awful.  The fajitas I got were literally one string of meat loaded with fat. I picked up one piece and the whole thing came up by strands and chunks of fat.  Yuck!  The service is awful and food is not far behind. I've never gotten good service at this location ever. Come to think of it chilis in general has awful service and awful management as well as sub par food that has somehow gotten way worse. We refuse to go here anymore.

Well, when we arrived (about 5-10 minutes early) our food was not ready and the staff claimed that our orders did not come in. I physically called the restaurant with my order, so I have no idea how that is possible. We waited about 10 minutes until our food was ready. Not ideal when you are on lunch break.

Steven P.,"Chepachet, RI",102,122,,4.0,7/30/2013,"When I go to Chili's, I expect the food to taste like it's from, well...Chili's! Chain restaurants stake their reputations on keeping their food quality the same from location to location so you know what you're gonna get. Why folks complain about that boggles my mind. So whenever a middle-of-the-pack chain restaurant breaks the mold (and isn't serving it) I think it extra worthy of praise. On our most recent visit, we were served-up two outstanding burgers -- both fresh, piping hot and equally mounded with Swiss cheese, mushrooms and other fixings -- as good as you'll find in many of the trendier burger joints. And it was served with fries still steaming, at a most inconvenient time, on a warm evening just before closing. Excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=20

Stephanie P.,"Central Falls, RI",37,151,26,4.0,6/26/2013,"I am not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but Chili's is right near the movie theatre I like to go to and we usually stop after a movie for lunch. The bartenders offer better service from my experience, but the tabe service is decent too. The food isn't top notch, still though, you can find things on the menu that are pretty good. My hubby loves the sliders and I like the flat breads. Some of their salads and sandwiches are decent too. If you're in the mood for an all- American sit down, try it. You'll be satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
Jeffrey L.,"Harvard, MA",0,2,,3.0,1/8/2015,"Its a Chili's; As always, they aren't brilliant at most of the things on the menu that aren't either burgers, fajitas, or fried chicken. I've always had the exact same experience with this one, though, which can't be said for the one up in Westford. Though what bugs me about this one though, is why the H. is it backwards??! The door is in the back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
Ed G.,"Providence, RI",0,13,,5.0,12/28/2013,"This is one of the BEST Chili's.  Whenever I go here I always have a great experience.  Very friendly staff, food is consistently good ... and an all around great environment ... with good music.  Definitely recommend Chili's in Lincoln!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
Bread Man S.,"Cumberland, RI",17,230,195,3.0,5/1/2013,Good for a chain. Greasy sandwiches. good service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
Kai O.,"Lincoln, RI",0,8,,2.0,12/10/2014,We used to go to Chili's all the time! Now they have changed their menu and it is not the same. My boyfriend usually gets the fajitas which used to be great and now they are bland and not as sizzling anymore. They have changed the way they make their burgers they now taste like an slight upgrade to McDonalds. The burgers now have a ton of mustard on them and they are served on new rolls which never needed to be changed in the first place and their homemade pickles which are salty and tasteless. They no longer have mushrooms which I loved on the mushroom swiss burger and with a steak. They are trying to turn more towards a mexican style restaurant and I thought it was way better as a mixture of american and some mexican style food. I am very disappointed because we loved Chili's and now we won't go back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
Shannon C.,"North Providence, RI",9,4,,2.0,11/24/2012,The music was horrible... All of us ordered the same dish and none of use enjoyed it .  We also all did not feel good the night of after eating the food.  All of us had some type of stomach issue.  Overall I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I can say that our server was good with the correct orders and making sure that we always had full drinks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
Steven N.,"San Jose, CA",129,222,68,3.0,10/20/2011,Our go to place when we are looking for a night out to eat. I havn't a bad experience here yet *knock on wood*,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
S W.,"Douglas, MA",0,10,,1.0,3/3/2013,"Staff is the only positive thing, very friendly and helpful.  However, I was forced to eat at this chain restaurant last night.  On my way to the restroom I caught a glimpse of the kitchen....and I started to throw up in my mouth.   I know most chain restaurants have vile kitchens, but this took the cake. I ended up only eating the celery sticks that came with the chicken wings. My kids said the tortillas were soggy and the boneless wings ""hard.""   Wow, how can you mess up frozen food?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
Jessica C.,"Stafford, VA",1,7,1,1.0,6/20/2012,"This place is not good. The food is greasy and generic. Ordered a salad today and it was disgusting, not to mention it was basically just lettuce with chicken on top. Service was terrible. Go next door to Five Guys instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
Alan R.,"North Attleborough, MA",39,5,,2.0,8/19/2013,"I love Chili's and will say up front that any other time I have gone has been a 4 star occasion.  However tonight they were very crowded waitress was overwhelmed but still friendly.  The one thing I cannot tolerate is when someone forgets to bring 1 person their meal.  Especially if its a child ordering from the child menu.  Parents will attest that its difficult enough to keep a 6yr old entertained but if you are going out then SERVICE is number 1.  Waitress had issues with computer system and erased our sons meal.  We had to wait addition 1/2 hour for his meal.  ...its a pizza!!!  Dominos could have delivered faster To their credit the Manager did comp our sons $5.99 kids meal. Yeah.  The food was excellent and overall they get 4 stars with me.  Just a note to the organization, please get it right when it comes to parents looking for a break and expecting some basic service.  You loose 2 stars for making us question why we needed the aggrevation but your quality food and ownership of your mistake will keep me coming back.   Again...just make sure your waitress look to see 3 plates of food when there are 3 people at a table.  Screw ups happen,,,,but we expect them at McDonalds...not here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
John O.,"Cumberland, RI",15,14,,4.0,11/30/2012,"typical Chilis's experience.  Same as you would get at any Chili's.  Service was a bit sluggish, but it was a crowded Friday night. Food was good and prices were, too.  Took advantage of the 2 for 20 deal - well worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3?start=40
