Leo M.,"Livermore, CA",0,37,,3.0,8/25/2017,"Family dinner -  Shared chicken fajita and bacon burger with wife. Had a Texas cheese fries for appetizer. We gave 3.5 stars for the burger, 3 stars for the fajita and 4 stars for the Texas cheese fries. Kids had mac and cheese and pepperoni pizza. Kids gave 5 stars for their meals. Speed of service was slow. Then again it's Friday. Overall service was fair. Value of food is excellent... Going with the lowest solid score, I would give today's experience 3 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore
keith r.,"Tracy, CA",85,39,15,1.0,10/9/2017,Chili's in livermore Went to this place for lunch / dinner cant remember what the waitress mixed my meal up with another customers meal.

Jennafer C.,"Danville, CA",62,16,2,1.0,3/23/2017,"I have always been a fan of Chili's! Well not anymore!  My first crummy encounter was a to-go order. I waited at their to-go counter for almost 10 minutes before someone offered to help. I got the smothered smoked chicken burrito and it was horrible. There was no sauce and was the driest thing I have ever had. I specifically asked for no sour cream and apparently that meant give extra sour cream and no burrito sauce! I also asked for the side to be rice, again not included. Being that it was to-go there wasn't anything I could do. I played it off as a bad visit.  I decided to return with my company. We were seated promptly and already I thought it was going to be great. We waited for 20 minutes before someone wanted to claim our table. Now, there was a party of six who sat directly in front of our table about 10 minutes after we sat down and not only were they greeted, they had their drinks and their food ordered before we even were greeted. Again our food was far from spectacular with sides missing and never a check in to see how we were or even drink refill.  Well why would I go back? Ugh, because I thought MAYBE it was just the holidays and the service/food was rushed. Today I again ordered online. Food was ok but I opted out of eating it and donated it to the dumpster after what I witnessed. I walked in the to-go door and waited in puddles of water as there seems to be some sort of leak. Standing water attracts bugs and other things! As I stood there waiting to be acknowledged.. AGAIN, I witnessed a server walk up to the food, touch the food with her bare hands JUST AFTER SHE WAS TOUCHING HER HAIR. She proceeded to lift up the hamburgers and go through the condiments. I witnessed this on 2 orders. She then asked where ""Luke"" was but with other choice words. I was disgusted. I threw my food away and I will never come back. All three visits were at this location. Maybe one day I will venture into another location but never this one! Chili's corporate needs to address this location! ASAP!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore

Amara J.,"Lathrop, CA",272,4,4,3.0,10/4/2017,Very disappointed. I placed an online order that was subpar to say the least. My crispers weren't pre-sauced. My salad was hot because it was put with my hot food. My salad had tomatoes which I very clearly ordered to be removed from the salad. It added cheese and charged me for it when it was only about 5 pieces in total. Beyond disappointed. I'd give 2.5 if able to but I can't unfortunately.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore

Robin S.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,,1.0,9/29/2017,"We ordered dinner to go. First off, their website did not offer a specification on how we wanted our burgers cooked so I had to call the restaurant to tell them medium rare. 2nd, we were told our order would be ready in 35 minutes. I arrived at the restaurant to pick up 40 minutes later and still had to wait for our order to be put together.  While waiting, the cashier helped pack our order up which was fine. The gross part was she took our onion rings out of one container and moved them to another with her bare, unwashed hands and wiped the crumbs on the butt of her pants. I quietly told her (in the nicest way I could, despite how grossed out I was) that I saw her using her bare hands that she uses to exchange money to touch our onion rings. No apology, no comment. All she said was ""Ok"".  If our experience wasn't bad enough, I get home to find our salad missing, and the extras that we ordered for our burgers (jalapenos, bbq sauce, guac, etc.) that I paid EXTRA for were missing from our order. Needless to say, we will be ordering dinner elsewhere in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore
Brendan M.,"Livermore, CA",13,10,,5.0,1/21/2017,"I figured it was time I finally gave this place a little praise. Chili's is always the answer for my wife and I when we don't know what either of us want for dinner.  Chips and salsa, Two for $22 and Trivia or Life on the tablet at the table. Never fails to satisfy me. It's so simple.  My wife is pregnant so she can't drink, but when she wasn't we loved experimenting with all the different fun mixed drinks Chili's has. She loved the watermelon cooler. I like the presidente margaritas. When our kid finally comes we are totally looking forward to this being our family night out restaurant. Don't break the bank, and get food where you get exactly what you expect. Best part about this place though? Not driving around 30 minutes for parking like you do downtown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore
Kathleen J.,"Livermore, CA",4,34,,2.0,2/16/2017,"I ordered the special which you get 3 items for $10. I ordered a chicken fajitas and also chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were delicious but the problem I had was the chicken was not really grilled .Also the chicken, the onions and a peppers were cold.

Sherry P.,"Patterson, CA",2,52,47,1.0,3/8/2017,"This was an unusual late dinner after work. Even more unusual that we chose Chili's since we've never been big fans but it was here or Denny's. I think we made the wrong choice. We sat in the bar. The atmosphere is kinda cool though the TV's were quite loud. Our server Brayan was attentive and polite. Now for the critique- My Caribbean salad had only 3 pieces of pineapple and those had bits of peel and hadn't been cored (uneatable), the cranberries and raisins were dried out(old), the lettuce wasn't even real cold. On the plus side there was plenty of shrimp. But be forewarned- the ""Honey-Lime"" dressing doesn't taste like either but it does taste like mustard, -the Balsamic dressing tastes like someone mixed Honey-Lime with a shot of vinegar, yuk. I love big, bold flavors but chewing on warm mustard seeds doesn't qualify. $11.89 and I ate 1/3 of it. Hubby's Prime Rib Tacos were equally disappointing. The meat was less like prime rib and more like pot roast slathered in some kind of fake ""grilling sauce"", VERY little avocado, black beans were room temp and didn't get eaten. Then, on my way to the bathroom I walked all the way through the mostly empty restaurant and saw food scraps under every table. One gal was sweeping (kinda) and the others were....? Needless to say I won't be back. At least at Denny's I know what to expect --like kitchen help that doesn't know how to properly cut up a pineapple but at least they know which foods are supposed to be hot and which are supposed to be cold. By reading all these reviews it's really surprising they are still around. The management reads these and must not really care that they are on the same path as Applebee's as nothing is changing. Fine by us, we'll wait for another hot spot to take their place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore
Tara G.,"Livermore, CA",16,144,18,1.0,5/28/2014,"By far one of the worst dining experiences I've had. Far worse than BJ's a few weeks ago and I really thought that was bad. Walked in at about 5pm, restaurant is generally empty. No hostess in sight. Lots of staff walking nearby and completely ignoring us. I finally yelled to one of them to be seated.  We get seated and our server was decently attentive and accommodating. He brought one set of silverware for 3 of us and a pile of napkins. I guess he figured my children would eat with their hands and thus need cleaning afterwards.  Napkins had blood, or what appeared to be blood on them. I pointed it out to the manager and the waiter did not take away the other napkins in the pile. He did, however bring me another napkin with blood on it....From the same bin. Manager ""investigates"" and determines that it's not blood but rather a watermelon sauce. I'm not convinced, nor am I impressed. I am a nurse so I feel fairly confident in recognizing blood. But...ok.  Food was mediocre at best and now I'm nauseous because I can't stop thinking about the blood and wondering what else had blood on it. I should have left then but any mother knows that leaving with two starving children to attempt to start dinner over again somewhere else is a perilous task.  I convinced myself that it either wasn't blood or that it wasn't in the food processing areas. I hope I was right. No. I will not be eating at Chili's...ever....again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=40
Steve B.,"Livermore, CA",4,32,,4.0,2/24/2016,"I'm a long time Livermore resident.  For some reason I have always went to Applebee and not Chili's.  On my last two dinner outings I decided to go to Chili's instead.  I was very pleasantly surprised by my visits.  Service was very attentive, food was tasty and the atmosphere was good.  The wait to be seated and to get the food out was a little slow but the waiters I had more then made up for the difference.  They made sure we were ok, kept the drinks full, and checked in on use to let us know the food was on its way and they hadn't forgot about us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=40
Kristi O.,"Plainfield, IL",391,410,1452,4.0,8/25/2013,Had a late lunch here on 8/24/13.  We sat in the bar and our server was Ariana.  She was nice and very efficient.   We like Chilis partly b/c of the chips and salsa so we started w/ that and added some guacamole which was rather tasty- they add corn to the guac which I liked.   We decided on the 2 for $20 option where you share an appetizer and you get two full sized entrees.  I ordered the Margarita Grilled Chicken (Lighter Choice) and added corn tortillas b/c they are my newest addiction.  The portion was perfect and the taste was good- I would order again.  My boyfriend ordered the Crispy Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers- he said the corn on the cob was over cooked- it looked like it- and everything else was fine.  I would visit this location again and I would sit in the bar area again as well- it's open seating- you can't go wrong w/ a comfy booth and several tvs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=40

Tonight was the same- fast service, friendly waitress, and good food. The appetizer of chicken nachos was a bit dry and could have used some guacamole (so I was told). :) My bf ate his crispy chicken tacos so fast I'm surprised I actually got a picture of them!

Tonny S.,"Livermore, CA",0,2,,5.0,3/20/2016,We really like this restaurant.  They allow to customize the French fries. Their French fries is the best .

YET.  Happy hour appetizers are substantially great prices and are meals in themselves, sliders/fried, fries/jalapeno/chili, pretzel sticks, chicken nachos, bonless or bone in chicken wings, all only either $2.99 or $4.99.    Not to mention you can watch your any of your favorite sports on the various televisions they have.

Paul G.,"Livermore, CA",20,373,174,3.0,5/1/2012,"Recently remodeled store, though the exterior color scheme now vaguely resembles BJs, which oddly enough, is due to open a few miles up 580 near the new Target at Fallon Road.  Anyway. Not a fan.  A number of the walls are down, and the rows of booths parallel to the kitchen on the right (as you walk in) are now open tables ""floating"" in the center of the floor.  Which is fine, but I feel somewhat like an animal at the zoo in such settings.  They still have some booths, but apparently a party of five (not to be confused with Party of Five) are often relegated to this area.   Can't hate the player for the decor, but the service wasn't super-duper, either. Three of us were here and ready to graze on some chips and salsa (graze, geez... another zoo implication) with a tasty beverage, but the server didn't appear until the other two folks arrived.  Refills weren't too speedy either, and not like I was downing my soda with the same fervor of a few years back (our table decided to test a Planet Hollywood's ""unlimited refills"" speed... 45 second to 1:15, by the by -- impressive). Here, less impressive.  Finally surrendered and ended up drinking the last of a clear, non-carbonated, non-flavored complimentary beverage I stole from another at our table.  Met the need, but wasn't nearly as satisfying.   All told... *now* I remember why Chili's isn't part of my regular dining out line card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=40
Carin C.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,12,1,1.0,6/10/2016,"Hoping Fabian Alonzo (manager name posted on door) will see this. Just left after eating at this very filthy restaurant. TWICE we were brought a stack of ""clean"" dishes to our table that had food on them (LOTS of food- noodles with cheese and wet lettuce on another). The friendly waitress quickly brought us paper plates at our request. Food was okay. As we left we walked by kitchen after leaving restroom and saw a filthy kitchen. Overall- very friendly staff with prompt service but hygiene is a real concern. I do not recommend this place until they implement the necessary workflow to be compliant with health code.

Staci S.,"Livermore, CA",46,11,2,1.0,2/24/2013,"I used to be a huge fan of Chili's and we used to go all the time.  About a year ago, my husband daughter and I went one weekend, and I got sick.  I figured it was just the flu but the following week we went back and my daughter got sick so it took us a year to venture back in. Last night was the first night that we ventured back in.  The only reason they are getting one star is because I do like the new decor.  Other than that, it was a horrible experience. First of all, the service is horrible.  Our server was Leslie.  She could not get rid of us soon enough.  Every time she came by she seemed very rushed and it was not even that busy.  Trust me, there were plenty of open tables and she spent plenty of time in the corner.  She brought us our dinner and then as soon as she cleared our plates, she brought us our check. She didn't bother to ask if we wanted anything else or if we wanted dessert. My husband and I both ate light so we could have dessert.   Second, the food looks horrible and was luke warm.  My husband had some buffalo wings and a side salad.  Some of his lettuce was wilted, his wings were thrown on a plate, and his ranch dressing was hot rather than cold.  I ordered the crispy chicken tacos, with no rice or beans.  The tacos came out cold but had clearly been sitting their for a while because the cheese had melted.  These tacos used to come in a rack, now the tortillas are thrown on a plate and all of the stuff is just thrown on top.  My daughters Mac & Cheese and cord were cold and looked old.  I didn't send anything back because Leslie looked irritated already and I didn't feel like wondering what would happen to my food if I sent it back.  As it is, she took a very long time at the cash register in the corner, so I am beginning to wonder if I am going to have some extra charges on my credit card. I must say sorry to the poor hostess who was probably all of 17 years old.  She asked us how our dinner was and I told her it would have been better if I would have even been offered some dessert.  I am pretty sure she was expecting me to say that everything was great but don't ask me a question if you don't want the real answer. Here are my suggestions: 1.  Get rid of Leslie.  She is going to drive your customers away. 2.  If Michael is still a bartender, have him give your waiters some tips.  You should have kept him as a waiter.  He is by far the best waiter that Chili's has ever had.  He is one of the reasons that we went back week after week in the past. 3.  Get your chefs to go back to culinary school.  Have them focus on presentation.  When the food looks bad, it makes the taste even worse. 4.  Have a manager at the front or someone who can handle complaints when people are asked how their meal was.  That poor girl that was there last night had no idea what to do or say to me.  What would have been nice is if she asked if I wanted to talk to an manager. Other than that, all I can say is good luck.  If more people experience what we experienced last night, you will be with Chevy's....out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=60

DH got a big burger and he said it was pretty good.  Better than ordering their BBQ BBRibs.   So, I would come back here - even without a GC to order the soup.  So far its the only thing I really like here.  And our meal was pretty inexpensive... so we will be back to use up the rest of the GC. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=60

The crispy onions were greasy and not as spicy as I would have liked. We were then brought the Chicken Fajitas and Cajun Chicken Pasta we had ordered. Once again the food was mediocre. My pasta was very bland and lacking in spice and so were my husbands fajitas.  We were pretty full by this point but decided to order dessert since we had a coupon for a FREE dessert of our choice.

Jennifer C.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/27/2017,"Just got back from eating at this place in Livermore.  I was quite surprised how bad my order came out.  Even worse, I am a bit shocked at the lack of concern from management.  I ordered the chicken crispers meal.  First, the chicken came out soggy(not crispy and I asked for the crispy version).  I took the breading off and tried to eat the chicken.  I don't know what happened to it but the chicken was not edible.  Didn't taste like real chicken.  It had a rubbery weird texture.  After one bite I decided I couldn't eat the chicken.  Next I tried the corn on a cob.  It was tolerable though had some places that was over seasoned and was really salty and peppery.  The fries were OK.  I am picky so thought it was just me and wasn't going to say anything.  However my boyfriend also tried the chicken and he couldn't get past one bite (note he had a chicken breast and it was fine).  He said it was worse then the worst Chinese chicken he has ever had.  So we let the waitress know about it.  She apologized and said she was going to take it to her manager.  Having worked in customer service, I actually thought something would happen... But to my surprise not only were we charged for everything, the manager never came out to apologize or at the very least check-in with us.  While I do understand mistakes and issues happen, I do not get the ignoring of those issues or lack of customer service.  So unfortunately those actions have caused this negative review (and I found out that this seems to be a common experience) and more then likely the Livermore chili's has lost two more customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=20
Melissa W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",117,45,21,3.0,9/29/2015,"Me and my boyfriend went here after a long day then driving for an hour and a half back to Sunnyvale from Sacramento so we thought we would make a pit stop because even though we wanted to grab a bite for the road, both of us didn't want fast food.  When we walked in from the wrong door apparently because the parking lot we came from was right outside of the side door so we walked in, not being acknowledged much until we both went up to the host and told her we sat ourselves down on the side since no one noticed. That didn't bother me much. I ordered my favorite appetizer, the chips and salsa, the salsa was so watery i gave up after trying to get something out of it which was disappointing, luckily it was happy hour and it was free or I would have complained how watery and gross it was, the chips were even beyond greasy, my boyfriend told me not to eat them anymore cause they were so greasy and flimsy. He ordered wings and I ordered a chipotle bowl, it was pretty decent, the waitress was sweet but I still probably wouldn't come back here if i was in the area.

Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,549,286,4.0,6/29/2013,"I frequent this Chili's quite often with my daughters and/or my friend. We come for both, lunch and dinner. For the most part, they are really consistent, food and service wise. There's only been one time when I've had a so-so waitress. She was just a little...blah, for my liking. But other than that, the food has always been good. They've always taken really good care of us. Even when it's busy, the wait to get a table usually isn't that long.  I've sat in the bar one time with my daughters, since it is open seating. I liked our waitress, but it seemed to take longer for everything to happen. Maybe because there was only one waitress in that area and it was busy that night. I probably wouldn't sit in the bar again, with my kids. Maybe fine with a group of friends.  We always seem to order the same thing: chips and salsa. I order the original chicken crispers with double order of fries with ranch. One of my daughters orders the chicken crispers with fries, the other a hamburger with fries and the third one, grilled chicken breast with oranges. They always talk me into getting a molten lava cake too...although they usually don't have to do too much convincing.  Chili's usually sends out good coupons for the weekdays. If you come here often, I'd suggest getting on their e-mail list. The only thing that was weird the last couple of times that we went here was with the molten lava cake. The first time my daughters and I ate one, it tasted like they had put pepper in the mix. I smelled it when she put the plate down. The entire thing didn't taste of it, just one side of it. I thought it was my imagination. Then when I went there again with my friend and my daughters, I smelled it again. My friend said she didn't smell it until she took a bite of it and said that it tasted like pepper. So weird. The place that they're storing them or where they're making them or something...it's somehow getting pepper on it. Not really that good...

Miss K.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,71,14,4.0,9/29/2011,"You can't beat Chili's for the value. The $6,$7,$8 lunch specials are the best deal in town (so to speak). The food is good and the service is friendly and usually efficient. They're good about resolving issues as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100
Lisa P.,"Pleasanton, CA",217,316,7,5.0,8/30/2008,"This review is all about the server.  Our servers name was ""James"" and he was one of the best we've ever had.  He was friendly, joked with us and helped make sure we ordered exactly what we wanted.  They have a ""design your own fajita"" thing and I was having a hard time deciding what to order so he helped me with some suggestions and I loved how it turned out.  I hope the management at this location take notice and acknowledge James accordingly.  And for the record, we didn't know James before we went there, haven't talked to him since, and had to wait to figure out his name because I knew I was going to yelp about the visit.  He told us when we were first seated, but I wasn't paying much attention because I had no idea that I would leave wanting to yelp about our great experience. I did go with just my oldest daughter and let her pick the place.  We had a nice time.  Ordered chips and queso, I ordered the make your own fajitas thing and my daughter ordered some sort of burger.  It was all outstanding and we will definitely go back provided we can be seated in James area. Thanks James for the great service.  We plan to return and ask to be seated in your are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100

Deirdre P.,"San Francisco, CA",31,311,11,2.0,2/22/2009,"2 stars sounds rather harsh, however its not that great, so thats whay they deserve. Service isn't the best, although the last time we went it was better. They had some issue with not giving our table to other party's like they kept forgetting about us?!?! whats up with that? I really like their presidente margarita! you get the little shaker thing and all, gets me rather buzzed, but i'm a light weight and I do not like to taste alcohol. food is always meh. Its not great food, its chilis food. In fact, I could make it much better at home, however sometimes you are just not in the mood to cook nor clean up--hence you are going to crappy places like chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100
Julie J.,"Livermore, CA",0,8,,4.0,2/12/2012,"Very knowledgeable about gluten-free menu choices.  I was recently in and asked the server if their tortilla chips are fried in a dedicated fryer. He went back to check, said they weren't, but that they were going to change the oil and fry up a new batch (it was early- 11:30, so they had the time to do this).  I loved the thoughtfulness of the server and the cook and I savored those fresh chips... YUM!   The next time I came in for lunch I asked the same question, but this time I wasn't as lucky. However, the manager did come over and explain how the fryer worked and when they changed the oil, etc.  He was very knowledgeable about food allergies and cross-contamination and made me feel very secure in my meal choice.  His staff was also educated and that is very important to anyone with a food-related allergy/intolerance/disease.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100
Clint S.,"Livermore, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/5/2013,"Had the country fried steak which came out burnt, sent it back and came out burnt again (maybe if they put more than a tablespoon of gravy could if at least tried to hide they burnt taste).  The manager was the person who brought the food out and when I told I didn't want it she just said ok and walked a way.  Terrible place will never go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100
Sara T.,"Livermore, CA",112,11,3,4.0,11/6/2010,"We absolutely love this place for 2 reasons. One, it's kid friendly, and two, our server for our most recent 3 trips has been Michael, who is just about the best server ever. We eat out frequently, but I can not sing this guy's praises enough. He is the reason we return. He is so on the ball, our drinks are never empty, he always bring extra napkins if the kids are with us, and he's obviously a hard worker. He takes the time to relate on a more personal level, sharing stories about his babies, and it's just an all around pleasant experience when he is our server. In the past we've had good service with others as well, but Michael just makes our meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100
Lauren F.,"San Diego, CA",656,700,112,4.0,4/15/2007,"You and seven others just threw yourself out of a plane....where are you going to go next??? Chili's in Livermore...thats where!  Suburbia at its finest.  Are we in Nebraska?  Are we in New Mexico?  Who knows, but it all looks the same, and it all tastes the same.  I like Chili's....always have, so 4 stars to staying a consistent corporate restaurant...and feeding our depleting adrenaline highs, and for being the total opposite of what we did in the morning.  But really, where would you go? We even got chocolate shakes for the birthday kids, and they sang to us!  How long has it been since that has happened?  A while I'd bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100
Sal L.,"Dublin, CA",147,47,9,2.0,5/27/2010,"When I lived in Livermore I used to frequent this location often.  I was in the area yesterday and decided to drop in for a bite to eat.  I remember this place usually being pretty busy, even on week nights.  So I was surprised to see the place pretty much empty.  What surprised me even more, was the slow service that came with the empty restaurant.  Took over an hour to get my food.  We had a party of 5, everyones food came out correct with no issues, hence the 2 stars, but EVERYONE'S food was cold!  I mean come on now, there was like 5 parties in the entire restaurant, very SLOW service and COLD food is just unacceptable in any situation, but even worse when its that slow.  Just goes to show that they don't really care much on customer service or quality of there product.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100
Chrissy F.,"Livermore, CA",8,107,,4.0,12/28/2012,Most of my four star rating is because of the service Kasie provides in the bar area.  My fiance and I eat here once a month and always sit in the bar area.  Kasie never ceases to amaze me.  She always has the entire bar area to herself and she delivers superb service.  She is very friendly and personable.  The food is fairly consistent but we always stick to burgers and salads.  If Kasie ever leaves Chili's they will be losing a huge asset.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100
Amanda G.,"Livermore, CA",0,18,,1.0,7/10/2013,"So chili's is okay! The food is alright, they have some good deals though. Just went in there for lunch today and I was so disguised, after I had ordered my food I look over to see women laughing , I then notice a HUGE really fluffy dog in the restaurant. I thought I hope that is a service dog! It was not! How gross! I am trying to eat my food and there is a huge dog sitting there. On top of that, every server, hostess, and manager walked right over it like it wasn't even there.  I would have left had I not ordered my food. I will not be back. That is so gross, the person I was with is allergic to dogs, and that is  huge health code violation. GROSS CHILI'S!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100
