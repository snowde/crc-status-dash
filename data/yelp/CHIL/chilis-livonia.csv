Anna S.,"Franklin, MI",183,331,24,5.0,8/24/2012,"I recently discovered the whole ""lunch combo"" dealies they have at Chilis and this is now my favorite lunch spot a couple times per week. I've been here about 6 times already the last few weeks and the service, consistency and cleanliness is great.  The waistaff I've had is always so friendly and attentive. Very nice for a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia
Shelly A.,"Detroit, MI",93,110,319,4.0,6/7/2017,"My family and I have been long time Chilis fans so this review of this particular location is going to be short. We tend to go during lunch time so there is never a wait. I always bring a jacket because Chilis is, well, chilly. Servers work in tandem now, which I find weird having worked there myself years ago and didn't need to tag team to give great service. Chilis menu has taken a complete overhaul, many new tasty items. This is the best thing about this location though, compared to others in the area, they make the BEST table side guacamole. I'm not sure why other locations get it wrong, but it's right here every time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia
Frances D.,"Westland, MI",111,11,7,1.0,10/6/2017,"I'm sorry to say but I was very disappointed with the ""carry-out"" last night.  I ordered a triple dipper and Queso dip and received cold food that needed to be heated up in the microwave.  What if I was eating in my car or a hotel that didn't offer a microwave?  I waited 20mins for cold food and then above all they do not give you guacamole in a separate container they put a spoon full in the dip guacamole is supposed to be cold not hot and some people do not like it, apart from that there was little to NO queso dip leaving nothing for my chips to dip in.  20 dollars I spent and everything had to be thrown away and wasted food because this restaurant did not follow protocol.  I expect the food to be prepared and hot when I receive it especially if I waited 20 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia
Kiesha S.,"Farmington, MI",185,9,2,1.0,7/27/2017,This Chillis is extremely slow. I have been here twice and the place was practically empty and it still took 30-40 minutes to get my food.

Kenneth B.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",12,9,,1.0,4/20/2017,"Me and a friend went into this Chili's on 4/19/17, the restaurant was about 1/2 full.  We were seated, and noticed that the table was very sticky, a waitress folding silverware was sitting in the back, we politely asked if we could use her rag,to wipe down the table, she said NO and, didn't even offer to wipe it down for us.  She stared at us for the next 20 minutes uncomfortably where we ended up walking out.   Our waiter came over and took our order , and we waited 20 minutes and still no water.  This place is poorly run in my opinion.  No management to talk too. For cleanliness I'd give it a 1. for service "" no comment.  Please get it together, I used to enjoy going to your establishment.  Hopefully this was just an off night for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia
Mandi B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",134,353,30,3.0,4/13/2016,"Its not like Chili's is a place you need to review ... It's pretty standard.  However, I had some amazing margaritas and great service, so thought I'd review on that.  Good margaritas are my kryptonite, so I decided to sample a couple...   The Presidente was amazing. My fave, hands down.  I also had the blueberry pineapple, which was really good, a little sweeter, but good.  Props to bartender Nicole for the killer drinks! I really appreciate that Chili's has a lot more veggie items on their menu now.  Unfortunately, they were out of quinoa so I didn't get to try it (I'm told by staff that they're always out of quinoa by the dinner hour... perhaps prep a little more in the morning?). I did eat my weight in chips and salsa, and had a shrimp taco a la carte, both went well with margs.  =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia
Greg H.,"Buffalo, MN",0,10,,1.0,1/24/2017,"Well, I try to give Chili's a chance.

Niky K.,"Westland, MI",494,136,23,4.0,12/28/2015,Visited on a Monday night. We were seated right away. Our server was nice. Our food came within a reasonable amount if time. It tasted awesome. The price was fair. Last time I was in I had Shekida aka keda not sure how she spells it but she was an Amazing server! Cant wait to be seated in her section again!!

Katie M.,"Livonia, MI",0,13,2,5.0,4/7/2017,They are great! There was one time when we came and they were out of chicken crispers (really?!) turned us off but ended up trying it again and enjoyed our food. The 2 for $22 is such a great deal!

Amanda K.,"Dearborn, MI",17,117,37,2.0,4/8/2016,"I hate even writing this review since we've had better experiences here before, but what we witnessed tonight really isn't acceptable. We ordered black bean burgers which came out covered in bacon. Veggie friends, here's where things got gross. We told them we didn't order black bean burgers with bacon on them, so the waitress took them back. 30 seconds later, she brings the same burgers out with the bacon peeled off (for the most part.)  When asked if they just peeled the bacon off, she said yes. Gross. We told her we are vegetarians and don't go for having meat on our food at all. She took them back just to return with (probably the same) burgers.  Great. Third time is most definitely not the charm. I dissected mine and could not find any bacon on it, so I ate half anyway. My boyfriend ended up sending his back after finding bacon still in it. Apparently there is a lack of respect for people with different dietary restrictions here, so if you're veg, be very careful and check your food.  The two stars are for our previous decent experiences and great margaritas. Otherwise, I'd give one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia
Martha V.,"Livonia, MI",0,6,1,4.0,11/13/2016,Pleasant service and good food. The 2 for 20 is a great deal and they also have some healthy choices!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia
Brett C.,"Brighton, MI",102,47,5,2.0,11/6/2014,"For a Friday, I was reasonably surprised that we were seated in 20 minutes. This location is typically jam packed and I understand that it's a longer wait at dinner on a Friday night. My disappointment here is with the actual service at the table. This location has implemented a new tabletop iPad-like menu and payment service that's supposed to speed things up. You can literally order your drinks, appetizers, food, and dessert all from this device that sits on your table. It's got games on it for the kids to keep them entertained while you wait. I'll be candid here: it's pretty pointless. Our server was still coming to the table to ask for things before we had a chance to use the device to move on to the next item. And when he did come to the table to ask us if we wanted more of something it then took an additional 10 minutes. It's a great idea in theory, but the execution was horrible. Other than that, it's Chili's. Nothing too special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia

Shunda B.,"Redford, MI",61,417,570,4.0,5/21/2012,"I highly suggest sitting at the bar especially if it's only 2 or 3 people, then you wouldn't have to wait to be seated. Service at the bar was tend bit slow but as long as you start with appretizer, then you shouldn't notice it.  Lol!   $2.00 for bottomless chip and salsa (I love it) Bartender was very fun and talk with everyone -- if you happen to sit near the employee door make sure to watch ur back because someone is always coming around but they do say when they are coming through.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia

Aaron L.,"Canton, MI",0,8,,5.0,8/10/2015,Stopped here one day after work with a rather large party.  Nothing to complain about.  The hostess made small talk while she showed us to our table.  We were seated right away even though they appeared to be very busy.  Our drinks came out quickly and our order was taken right away.  Our food was hot and our orders accurate.  We never had to ask for a drink refill since it was already done by the time we thought about it.

Krystle C.,"Novi, MI",0,17,,4.0,4/2/2016,"9 times out of 10 my service has been great here and so has the food. Most of the staff is personable and fun to talk to. Drinks can be a bit slow at times when they only have one bartender so order a double round if you're worried about it and it's busy. Only one bad experience and will likely done at tables instead of at the bar due to the lack of attention the bartender can provide while doing all their duties. Was served a very greasy meal there that hadn't been properly drained (the batter was sliding off the chicken like melting butter) but it took a long time to get the bartender to come back to fix it. I wanted it taken off the bill and to just finish my appetizer instead, but was charged for two of the meal instead somehow, and double charged for my drink. It took 3 explanations of what was wrong with the bill to get her to correct it. Aside from that, every other experience has been great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia?start=20

Craig L.,"Chattanooga, TN",134,409,79,1.0,2/11/2013,"I hate writing this review.  We have been to this Chili's a number of times and the service was good, the food was Chili's.  Our last experience, however, was unbelievable.  I try very hard to give allowances for service failures as anyone can have a bad day but this time it was over the top.  My wife and I drive a semi truck and parking often determines where we can relax.  We also only drink about once a month as we cannot move the truck once we have had anything to drink.  That being said, our ""60 square foot condo"" was parked 50 feet behind the restaurant. Super Bowl Sunday and the place was less than 25% full.  We, along with another trucking couple, ordered appetizers and a round of drinks.  We then proceeded to watch the game and eat dinner.  Our original server disappeared after about 30 minutes and we never saw her again.  We found out later she had gone home.  We had to ask over and over again for everything.  We were ignored for 30 to 45 minutes at a time to the point that we finally started busing our own table and moving dirty dishes to the empty table beside us.   Our drinks were empty for over a half hour.  When we finally flagged down a server for a refill he had to make the drinks himself as the bartender was too busy watching Beonce.  He made the drinks and then left them on the bar.  Ten minutes later they still sat there and we could get nobodies attention.  So my friend got up and grabbed the tray and served us.   For dinner I ordered the Ranch Bacon Chicken Quesadilla.  When the food finally came there was no ranch.  The server did not say anything so I asked for it.  He said ""we are out of the spicy ranch""  On a side note, when the word ""Ranch"" is in the title of the dish, it is a little important that you inform the person ordering the meal you are our of the ranch dressing.  I asked if they have regular ranch dressing and hed said sure.  Can I have some please?  He walked back to the kitchen and did something for a couple of minutes, then walked out and made a hard right turn, walked across the restaurant and into the bathroom.  The manager came by and asked how our evening was going.  I asked for ranch and he went and got it.  When he came back I told him what we had been dealing with.  I told him I knew it was not a systemic problem as we had been here a number of times before and service was always good.  I also told him we had one server, out of the four different ones,  (the one who had made our drinks) who was actually trying.  The manager apologized and I saw him pull his staff together in the kitchen and read them the riot act.  Three minutes later our server came by the table and asked if we needed anything.  I asked him for a new drink as mine had been empty for over a half hour.  He walked away shaking his head.  A couple of minutes later the manager walked up with our bill.  It turns out our server had cut us off.  We had all had three drinks in 3 1/2 hours.  I would REALLY have liked to have had a couple of more drinks but we could not get a servers attention.  I asked him to look at the bill and tell me if he thought we had had to much to drink.  He said no.  I asked if we were acting like we had had to much to drink, he said ""No, but I have to back up my staff""  I said, you mean the staff that you just yelled at for sucking?.  He just kept repeating that he had to back up his staff.   I used to be a management consultant for restaurants and this was just amazing.  I would appreciated being cut off if I had imbibed to much but this was ridiculous.  Never going back.  I did tell him to make sure the young server knows that his decision to retaliate against me cost him a $25 dollar tip since, for only the second time in my life, I was leaving no tip and I had planned on tipping him as he was the only one who seemed to try. I am also writing a letter to corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia?start=20

S J.,"Ferndale, MI",11,12,6,2.0,12/1/2013,"Well, that didn't go well. We should have turned back when we weren't greeted for a few minutes at the door.  The menu has changed, which is really unfortunate for vegetarians. I know it's a meat-centric restaurant, but we should be able to go places our friends like to and not always get salads. I'm sick of salads. So apparently Chili's got rid of their Portobello mushroom fajita. I asked the waiter if the mushroom fajita was still available, and he answered that it was. So maybe this is my fault for not being more clear, but what I got was the old mushroom Jack chicken fajita (also covered in bacon, which I was just going to work around until I noticed it was all chicken). Our waiter quickly put in an order for a veggie fajita. The problem was is that I waited about another half hour to get the corrected version (mind you I'm with friends and my three year old, all trying to be polite and not finish their meals). I was pretty disappointed with the waiter during this period, as he only acknowledged that I didn't have my food yet once. Eventually the manger came out and was apologetic and polite. We were given half off my meal, but still had to correct another issue with the bill. My husband's meal was also very mediocre.  The food was all edible and this wasn't a disastrous situation, which is how it's retaining two stars. I'm really disappointed with the Chili's franchise in their new menu. I'll have to go there next.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia?start=20
Claude J.,"Canton, MI",3,77,20,3.0,8/1/2014,"Their specialty is fajitas, quesadillas, and enchiladas, what else can you say the day we went they had numerous menu changes or were out of the items I wanted to order.

Robb T.,"Milford, MI",71,121,17,3.0,1/24/2011,"The service here has always been a touch slow, if not inattentive, and they are often inaccurate. In fact, the service rarely anything approaching good. The only thing they seem to be good at is getting it wrong.  The food is always ok, though. They are ok with making it right... If only they started there in the first place. If you want something, you have to ask for it. That goes for extras like mustard (why this is an extra I have no idea) and often refills.  I don't want this place to hurt for business, because it is one of the few American food options in the area. But all the same, they need to work harder on the service side. The food does all the heavy lifting, bringing me/friends back.  It is the only saving grace, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livonia?start=20
