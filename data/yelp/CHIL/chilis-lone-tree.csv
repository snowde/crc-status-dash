Connie S.,"Littleton, CO",12,37,19,5.0,4/27/2015,"Excellent service, selection, happy hour, & location!  I  had unlimited soup,salad & chips with salsa and my boyfriend had fish tacos both delicious & served in a timely manner. Nice bar inside the dining area with    lots of tvs/sports. It was 3pm since we were at the nearby medical offices before we were starving for lunch...lol! Great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Rowena B.,"Centennial, CO",80,501,1131,3.0,8/30/2015,"We came here for an early dinner before heading out for a big night on the town. We only had limited time so being able to pay the bill via the screen thing at the table was really handy....especially with the level of service. Really friendly girl, but everything was a bit of a shambles.  It wasn't busy, half the tables were empty. We waited ages for our beer and she forgot the lime. She said she would bring it over. We waited, and waited then really slowly started drinking the beer, by the time she remembered it was half gone.  The guys got chicken sandwiches and I got the sweet & spicy burger. I asked for it to be cooked medium, it was well done. I didn't complain or send it back because we had to get going and it wasn't too dry. They came out in pretty good time but she forgot my ranch dressing, she got that pretty quick smart. The guys said the sandwiches were really tasty. My burger was good but the onion rings would have been better on the side, couldn't really taste them in the burger. The bill for the 3 of us came to about $35 so not bad really.  The screen thing on the table also had an ad for a $30 uber voucher, so we did it and it worked! That was out free trip home from the city. Thanks for that chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Craig P.,"Denver, CO",1,360,617,4.0,4/9/2015,"Yes, it is a chain but who can't help loving their chips and salsa? We always receive good service. In fact may time we get treated better here than we do at the more upscale independent restaurants. The food is tasty and fast. Honestly what more can you expect from Chilis?!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Denise R.,"Aurora, CO",651,491,905,4.0,6/15/2016,We went to Chili's to get a quick bite I have to say we got the appetizer it was good we got to try pretty much everything Plus our waiter was very nice,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Lin M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,8,,2.0,11/30/2016,"I went here for my 62nd birthday. While the waitress was attentive, she was also too busy. Staff seemed stretched. Food was presented well but overly salty. We ordered dessert via the table technology, but the dessert brownie seemed a bit too chewy on the bottom--and then I realized it had baked parchment paper on the bottom! I realize I probably need more fiber in my diet at my advanced age into senior citizenry, but please!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Correy H.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",197,444,181,4.0,12/24/2013,This is a great location with awesome customer service. They always seem attentive and have sincere attitudes. The food has always been as promised.  The great benefit to this location specifically is that they are so close to Park Meadows and shopping --- but out of the way so you can easily get in and out without issue. Big plus -- they keep my drink full with free refills.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Drew B.,"Denver, CO",270,22,11,5.0,9/26/2014,"We visited Chili's at Lincoln & Park Meadows Drive in Littleton, CO last night and after MULTIPLE meals at the restaurant over the years, this particular time was better than ever, because of our waitress, Jenny.  Jenny went above and beyond for us last night even though they were short staffed during their peak dinner rush last night. My dad, girlfriend and I ordered apps and entrees at the same time but Jenny made sure our app came out before our meal, per our request. She was prompt with drink orders and we didn't have an empty glass of water, coke or wine during dinner. She was attentive and stretched VERY thin last night. I sent her to the kitchen for a couple additional condiments and side of onion rings, and with her MANY tables last night, she fulfilled my requests within minutes. Deb was courteous, friendly and attentive to our table. I can only assume she gives every table this same treatment (as there was no reason to hold us to a higher standard).  I LOVE Chili's and frequent many different locations often, but because of Jenny, I will be eating at this Chili's location as often as I visit. Thank you for going above and beyond for my father, girlfriend and me last night, Jenny. You've made a customer for life out of me and a raving fan!!

Joseph P.,"Littleton, CO",0,22,54,1.0,8/17/2014,"What a disappointment.   We were really looking forward to this new location and the menu changes advertised.  We should have realized what we were in for when the less than attentive hostess seemed disinterested in a party of five.   We were seated in an area without anyone else and had a succession of THREE servers all indicating that they were in fact our server!    We finally got our drinks and appetizers ... 10 minutes later we were still awaiting refills and an answer to a menu question we'd raised.  Very frustrating.   At 15 minutes we went looking for our server - to no avail.  I decided enough was enough and utilized the convenient table payment system to pay for the drinks and appetizers so we could leave - a word of caution, in playing with the system I somehow purchased $0.99 unlimited table games.  As 3 of our party were out the door the manger appeared asking if she could make it right.  Too little - too late.   Chipotle sets a high standard that Chili's is nowhere near matching.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Cathie M.,"Golden, CO",2,5,,1.0,10/24/2015,"I ate there with my daughter about a month ago. Never again. The drinks never did make it to our table. After about 20 minutes I noticed they were just sitting and melting at the bar so I went and got them myself. Also, we were in a time crunch and the place was empty so should have been a quick in and out, right? Nope, food took 30 mins to get to us, I ate a little and took the rest home. Then a few hours later became extremely sick. After vomiting a couple of times during the night, I finally felt well enough to go to the refrigerator and throw my leftovers away. I've eaten at many Chilis and this was by far the absolute worst experience ever. I know the food and drinks are not the best but usually the service makes up for that. Not this time, and never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Renee B.,"Littleton, CO",39,85,9,5.0,12/31/2015,"One of my favorites.  I love their ""2 can dine menus"".  The only thing that i dont like is their tablets.  Its easy for kids to purchase games and you dont know until the bill comes.. should be a way to block this or waiters to let us know before letting them play on it.. but still a favorite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Nicole W.,"Denver, CO",254,1723,580,3.0,4/17/2011,"It is what it is, a chain in suburbia... Hostess is less than friendly and has been there since we used to have a house down there. We visited with a group of 20 on a Saturday night, we called to indicate we were coming, and they said no problem. We were all in town for a conference at the Marriott down the road. Our waiter was very cool, straight forward, was able to split all the checks and did a great job making sure all the food was correct and came out on time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Bryan M.,"Denver, CO",9,91,100,5.0,10/11/2013,"One very well maintained restaurant.  The staff have always been nice and attentive.  My dad and I used to come here on a consistent basis.   The menu has changed a little bit, but that's to be expected.  I highly recommend this Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Thor C.,"Englewood, CO",254,139,47,1.0,9/2/2012,"I got a Mushroom Swiss burger for takeout.  Nothing but bad news here. Fries were cold, limp and under seasoned.  Patty was way less than awe inspiring.  Buns were thoroughly soggy.  Mushrooms were undercooked  and were cut way too thick to stay on a burger, Swiss was barely evident. For a $10 meal, I expect way better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Jeff S.,"Washington, DC",50,74,17,3.0,5/10/2010,"Good service, they make an effort to keep your drinks full, make sure you are all set, without being pushy at all. It is nice for a chain to have this type of service, very happy to report it. Typical Chili's food (which i like), very heavy and satisfying. Location is just off of I-25, Lincoln exit, easy to find.  The southern smokehouse bacon burger is awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Kristina Y.,"Parker, CO",220,34,66,3.0,2/18/2013,"The happy hour is decent, 2 for the price of 1 on house wines and select draft beers. The margaritas are not suggested as they taste like straight sweet & sour.  Free chips & salsa in the bar or with a foursquare check-in. You get a free dessert every 3rd check-in on foursquare as well. The service is typically very good. I enjoy the combo fajitas Cadillac style.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Corrie A.,"Littleton, CO",1,9,10,5.0,9/28/2011,We've had awesome service at this Chilis!  I love the New Santa Fe Sizzling Skillet,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Billy T.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,2,,3.0,7/20/2015,On a previous visit to chillis park meadows an issue in the restaurant happened that ended having to go to the regional manager but after he promptly called he was very professional and actually listened to the issue. Made the situation right and will definitely return to chillis again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Brad C.,"Lone Tree, CO",11,60,21,1.0,2/8/2014,"Lunchtime with the family. My 3 year old boy orders chicken strips off the kids menu. Problem is that when they came out, they were RAW inside. Raw chicken...not the best way to enjoy your lunch. Disappointed; especially since this was a kids menu order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Erin S.,"Lakewood, CO",49,138,2,3.0,2/12/2013,"Came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my boss on our way back from Colo. Springs.  The service was great, considering it was the lunch rush.  Our waiter was attentive and never left our drinks empty.  Food came out quiclky and hot (which is a plus. I have been to some where you could tell that the food had been sitting around for a while before it was brought to the table). One of the better chain restaurants around as far as food and service in concerned IMO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Jafey A.,"Parker, CO",6,398,,2.0,7/16/2013,"Chilis is Chilis, my expectations aren't much- the chips and queso are great- but the service at this location is the worst out of all the Chilis- especially in the bar area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree
Kevin S.,"Lone Tree, CO",65,39,4,3.0,5/16/2011,"Been to one Chili's, you been to them all, for the most part.  Don't expect anything different from this one.  The food is OK, not bad, not great.  Selection is typical of middle of the road chains.  Service is usually good.  They don't pester you and they keep your drinks full.   Waitress tonight was the bartender Kelly, nice girl and good at her job.   Food was good, drinks were good.  It is exactly as you would expect from a Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree?start=20
Lance L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",7,24,17,5.0,10/16/2011,"This Chili's stands out for me, as the staff has provided exemplary service time and again.  My girl and I enjoy the two-for-twenty menu, as the portions usually mean a couple meals for each of us.  It's a consistently nice experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree?start=20
Anne R.,"New Orleans, LA",21,118,77,2.0,1/15/2011,"2 vegetarian options on the menu (btw that = crap ""black bean burger""  that was made from sodium or custom salad you had to request???).  server was pushing apps and desserts and crap.  is this what dining at a chain is like? kill me now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lone-tree?start=20
