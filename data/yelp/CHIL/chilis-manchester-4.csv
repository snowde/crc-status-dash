Tiffany A.,"Manchester, CT",142,71,8,5.0,9/15/2017,"I don't know why this business doesn't have a lot of stars because I came here last night for thirsty Thursday and from now on this is my go to bar whenever I want to get drinks with a couple of friends.  Came here with my boyfriend at around 7 o'clock, we asked if they had happy hour and amazingly they have happy hour all day. I got an appetizer of the spiciest wings they have I forgot the name of it but it was very good and well said. Most places when they say spicy sometimes but  doesn't have a kick to it but these one sure do! We also ordered an appetizer of nachos and when they mean loaded, they mean it. Each an individual chip was loaded with cheese, beans ,beef, lettuce tomatoes ,avocado , onion, and sour cream. At first when it was served to us it didn't look very appealing and it didn't seem like it was enough for both of us but considering the fact that every tortilla chip was loaded it was pretty feeling surprisingly. Now let's not forget about the drinks. Usually their specialty margarita is $10 for a glass BUT on Thursdays it's five dollars off so me and my boyfriend had four margaritas for just $20.  I WILL DEFF COME BACK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4
Cory S.,"Hartford, CT",135,21,4,1.0,9/27/2017,"I really love Chili's as a chain. I think they're a reasonably priced, fun place to go out with friends when you're not looking to do any intense foodie exploring. However, I was severely disappointed with the customer service during my visit here.  I came with a group of friends, and we called at least half hour in advance to warn them and make sure they would be able to take us. We were told they could certainly take us without any issues at all. Once we staggered in and begun taking our orders things went straight downhill. Overall, once we had all arrived, the service was pretty slow and several mistakes were made. My friend's burger was severely undercooked, orders were given to the wrong people, and one friend had to wait nearly 20 minutes before the waitress remembered to bring out her food, even after we asked. My friend with the undercooked burger had to wait nearly 45 minutes for a new burger. I ordered a second drink but never actually received it, but it was still on my bill.  Now a lot of my friends and i have worked in food service. We know horrible days happen and we didn't want to handle this with anger. We were informed that they were short staffed and that our waitress was somewhat new. The manager tired to be accommodating of all of our needs, but it still took far too long to actually assist us. While my friend with the undercooked burger received his meal for free, the manager only offered to take 10% of each our bills. If the issues would have been handled well then maybe I'd be okay with 10% off, but we were all inconvenienced by these prolonged waits for our friends' food. 10% off is such a laughable attempt at fixing the issue, especially because the first time they brought out the bills all the charges were mixed up. Our total time spent at this restaurant was nearly two and a half hours. I was completely disappointed in the attempts to resolve these issues. Worst Chili's experience I've ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4
Maggie K.,"Central Manchester, CT",140,312,375,4.0,6/7/2017,"I'm not sure why there are such bad reviews for chili's... I absolutely love their corn on the cob and the desert menus... good number of options for vegetarians (fajitas, salsa, guacamole, salads, etc.) The chocolate molten cake is my new favorite here! Good ambience with large group seating facility and they also have a bar area... good to watch a game and to celebrate! Sometimes the wait staff is busy and you might have to wait for couple of minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4
Mary R.,"Tolland, CT",79,66,32,3.0,11/6/2017,"This is our closest Chili's and we've been here several times a year since it opened. The last few years, however, actually since they added the Zoosk tabletop devices, it became abysmal. (Not the end of the story - please keep reading) Most memorable was an evening that my son and I spent waiting for service. Then waiting for someone to tell that our order had issues. Then to receive our replacement order... when we flagged down a manager he gave us a quick lecture on using the Zoosk and advised we start doing that instead of waiting for service. Um... NO. Popular with families with small children, on that visit the restaurant was filthy and destroyed by previous customers with a lot of screaming kids, uncleared tables and debris scattered on the floors. It was really, really bad. SO we stopped going. Fast forward a  year ... THEN, recently, I received a 50% off coupon for fajitas and a separate one for a free birthday dessert in my email and decided to give it another try. VERY glad I did! They seemed to have come to grips with the fact that Zoosk does not make up for a live server. Still popular with loud children and babies, our meal was accompanied by a lot of nearby hungry crying - but at least it wasn't us!  We had an awesome, attentive waitress who was very open and friendly and offered several quick thinking options to my fussy son. As frequent restaurant diners we have learned to ask for what we want, including extra plates and pre-split by the kitchen desserts. Our food was tasty and well cooked and we had zero complaints. I had the beef and chicken fajita combo and it came with more fixins than I remember and I was very pleased. Kids had burgers and were equally happy. The salsa that comes with their chips is really good also. We were pleasantly surprised that Zoosk accepted our multiple coupons and felt like the evening was a total success. Now, all they need to do is renovate their restrooms... **addendum: worth mentioning that the street sign and all parking lot lights were not turned on and anyone coming for the first time would have thought they were closed. Reading through other recent reviews that read more like my introduction about how this place had ""gone down hill"" I think this location really seems to have spotty management. I noticed they stopped having a manager respond to bad reviews here. Surrender? I hope not. I removed one star for these reminders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4

Deeksha S.,"Manchester, CT",0,7,6,5.0,10/4/2017,"I am surprised that I am actually giving Chili's a 5 star rating today! When we were served a little stale quesadillas and a Mango glazed chicken was replaced with some random sauce last minute, I was sure to come home and give them a 1 Star on Yelp. But the management surprised us. Not just did they give us a discount on our bill but also we were given a free dessert plus a 15$ gift coupon!! Well that's what I appreciate.. You've done a mistake and then u take steps to rectify it... what better than that! Nevertheless this was my second visit in less than a month and I had loved the quesadillas the first time.. so don't worry... today might just have been the Chef's bad day!

Anup B.,"Manchester, CT",38,92,296,2.0,8/20/2016,"Very disappointed with the service. Took about 10 mins for the server to notice us. She probably was not supposed to serve us and was covering up for someone else. Order was served 25mins later. It was thursday evening.  We ordered: Guacamole burger, Sunrise burger Both burgers were above average, expensive. Its not worth the wait and money. Overall this place was dull as compared to other Chillis i have been to. Probably a little more enthusiasm and interest would work well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4
Gretchen L.,"Ellington, CT",0,5,,4.0,10/25/2017,Good food.  Decent service.  The new menu is good.  Not as many choices but everything was delish.  Chicken enchilada soup always a winner.  The house salad was really good.  Quesidilla explosion salad was very tasty!   Nice choices in on kids meals.  Chips and salsa were good but tons of broken chips just bits of chips.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4
Mariceli B.,"Hamden, CT",13,3,,1.0,10/6/2017,"I've given the place more than a try, from the bar trying drinks and apps to the dinning ordering entres.   Each time a disappointment. The quality of the margaritas very low. The southwest egg roll really bad. As for entrees today we ordered chicken fajitas and the chicken was cold. Just contrary of the sizzling hot fajitas we were expecting. Bummer... So we thought to order the Molten to make things ""feel better"" and oh no. The molten was warm and the middle wasn't melted! It was cold! Shaking our heads... What is it with Chillies from the US!!!

Vicki B.,"Tolland, CT",66,358,1076,3.0,11/27/2016,Everyone knows what they're getting into when deciding to go to chilis. Average food at decent prices.  We pick chilis to sit in the bar for $5 margaritas and appetizers.  Skillet queso and salsa one of my faves. The trio of pick three appetizer is great with a group because everyone can get what they want.  Don't expect gourmet and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Great watering hole after getting the post thanksgiving shopping done.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4
Seth B.,"South Windsor, CT",115,23,11,1.0,5/17/2017,"Food was horrendous. Salsa with the chips was watery. The enchiladas cheese was overcooked, crusted, and looked a day or two old. The guac with the fajitas was brown when it came over. The fajitas had a ton of onions with three slices of green peppers, and the lava cake dessert was overcooked!! Every single part of the meal was awful.  The one saving grace was our server was nice. She barely was able to come to our table as she was the only one working apparently. She was behind the bar and checking on everyone in the sit down area. Still, the worst food I have had in the area. The tvs are also very sparse and extremely small.  AVOID!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4
Noah B.,"Vernon, CT",38,95,86,1.0,8/13/2016,"I usually like Chili's.  Tonight's experience might make me change my mind. We were seated immediately at around 5:45, ordered our food around 6:05 (no servers came to our table for 10 minutes and then it took another ten minutes for the waiter to come back with our complicated drink order of two waters and an iced tea. Our food finally arrived at 6:45. The people at the table next to us were irate because they'd ordered before us, and their food STILL hadn't arrived.  My son's fajitas were delivered with the wrong meat (it came with prime rib cubes that were overcooked and flavorless), none of the upcharged avocado slices and chicken that looked like it had been dumped out of a bag of Perdue shortcuts, not cooked in the kitchen. My friend's hamburger came our correctly! My chicken crispers were cold and overcooked, but my corn was delicious.  At least the part that was still warm.  I was still hungry so I ate it anyway. A manager came by, and we flagged her down.  She did the right thing by taking the fajitas off the bill and comping our dessert. Overall, this was not a good experience  I will try another Chili's elsewhere, but will not return to this location..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4
David C.,"Manchester, CT",0,17,,4.0,8/13/2017,"We eat dinner here often, as we live close by. The last two times, last night being the most recent, the food was terrible--over cooked ""hockey puck"" type burgers and cold fries, both of which are usually excellent. On a brighter note, our waitress was wonderful (we did not bring issue up to her) and the service fantastic. I know the food was not her fault because she has waited on us several times and always gets it right. There's obviously a problem in the kitchen. I hope that the burgers and fries return to what I am used to because I really want to continue to eat here, but am considering another location.  Returned several more times and things were back to normal. Great job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4

Chris W.,"Ellington, CT",0,6,,1.0,10/22/2017,"Been to this Chili's a couple times per year and based on last night's visit, will be a long time till I'm back and I'm a reasonable guy.  Host would not commit to any type of range with how long till we'd get seated. Waitress seemed overwhelmed and very disorganized, causing me to have to remind her multiple times what we needed during our meal. Food was average, not hot when it came out, between the chicken sandwich, burger and turkey club we got. Pet peeve - waitress disappeared after leaving us the bill for at least 10 min - leaving us to pay on their tabletop device.  With so many non-chain restaurants offering better food and service in the area, as well as fast casual offerings up there, in popularity, I'm hoping last night was an anomaly for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4

Lauren M.,"Fairfield, CT",0,3,1,1.0,2/26/2017,"This branch of chilis is a disgrace to the chain name. We waited 45 minutes for a table just to be told that they ran out of 1/2 of the appetizers on the menu. Though the service was good, the food was awful. I could've eaten at a gas station and felt more  satisfied. Not only was the food an extreme letdown, but I have never sat in a dirtier restaurant! The floors looked like they hadn't been moped in years and the bathroom was repulsive. If that's how dirty the eating area is I can only imagine how dirty the kitchen is.

I decided to walk around to find some who could help and there were three employees sitting at a table talking and having a good time. Asked if anyone was working here and they replied "" not us, but we'll find someone"". Waited another 5-10 minutes, still no one showed up. Walked to the kitchen and asked if anyone was working and got a very rude reply of "" yeah we're actually pretty busy"".  Needless to say we left and went to the Friendlys next door, which had much better service.

If it was a jam packed  night I wood under stand. But if  never be back free  not even worth the experience.

Adam W.,"Meriden, CT",69,23,3,1.0,12/16/2016,"It pains me to write this but the last two years I feel like every chilis has gone down. This one I had several issues with but felt I wanted to give them a second or third shot. I came on a Tuesday evening with my wife. Not very packed but looked around and everyone was waiting for food/drinks. We had to waive our server down or call the manager over to even get a simple refill. Apparently several cooks had called out and I legit felt bad for the manager who apologized. Her server however could have told us from the beginning and focused on drinks and chips coming out quick. When the food did come out after 1 hr, it was cold as ice. The manager apologized and gave us gift cards to come back.

Brian H.,"Colchester, CT",82,10,2,1.0,9/2/2017,"It was my daughters birthday, due to the lava cake this is the main reason why she chose this for her birthday location.. after waiting to be seated, we placed our food order quite promptly - to the tune that I wasn't fully ready to order, but wanted too because it seemed quite busy. Looking around after we ordered, the majority of the people around us already have been served their food so we just assumed that it wouldn't be that bad of a time lapse until our meals came. Well it was almost an hour to be served a burger, side salad, mac and cheese and chicken tenders. The mac and tenders were standard as far as quality but my burger was a joke. Literally got a chunk of bell pepper and 1 onion ring on a rubber patty with bacon that looked like it was microwaved. The corn on the cob was slimy and nasty. I asked the server, with all due respect could you ask the manager to try again - this is disgusting and not worth the $12 you expect to charge me. Came back with another burger held by the boss which wasn't much better. He said he would discount our bill and give us a free dessert. He had no explanation for the quality of how the food was prepared.

They said it would take 45 minutes, which seemed excessive considering the order.  Actual time to get the food was over an hour. When I got there to pick it up at the 45 minute mark, I went to the take out entrance where I was greeted by 6 staff members just standing around who told me that I had to go to the bar to pick up my food.  So after sitting at the bar for over 15 minutes, my food arrived. Having no confidence, I checked the food.  Good thing I did because they forgot to include fries wth the burger.  It was just the burger in a large styrofoam container and a response ""oh, did I forget the fries?  Oops.""  I should have checked the burger, because when I got home, I found that it was made wrong and the stuff we asked to be held was on it.

When he came back I asked him for a salad and he said he'll get me one to go after I waited to get his attention for 15minutes after I was finished with the 1st round.

Then walked over and seated me and my two friends at a dirty table because it was the end of the night and they had cut off certain sections. But the whole section they were searing customer in was completely a mess, it looked like fireworks with food and napkins and trash.

However when we walked in the hostess gave us a dirty look... Seriously, like mean mugged us. She continued to then rest her head on her hand on the hostess stand like she was bored and miserable. A party came in a few minutes after us.. And this hostess walked up to us.. At least we thought.. I kid you not helpers she looked my fiance dead in the eyes and asked ""how many"", which she started to answer.. And the woman cut her off and said ""I was actually going to seat them first"" and continued to escort the 5 FIVE 5 people who walked in after us to a table. What kind of rude BS was that?!?!? Our experience only got worse from there. When the miserable hostess finally sat us We must have got the new waitress. :( Poor girl couldn't tell her butt from her elbow (keepin it clean). We ordered $5 margaritas and chips and salsa. I again kid you not we didn't receive our drinks until about 20 minutes after we ordered. It gets better..... Those chips and salsa came out 10 minutes after the drinks... WHAT ARE THEY DOING BACK THERE????  We then placed our order with her when she finally brought the chips.. Mind you, at this point in time all of our drinks had been empty for about 15 minutes with no promise of a refill. After she took our order she did not come back.. I repeat ... She did not come back to our table.. Period.  With that being said we enlisted the help of the waitress who's section was next to ours.. She had minimal tables and was the happiest peppy little 21 year old you could imagine. Bussing her own tables and working hard. I slipped her a $10 and told her not to share it... At this time she became our waitress. She literally brought over our food refilled our drinks and generally speaking treated us like we were her very last hope at a tip.. WELL! when we were almost done with our meal our original waitress came back and asked ""how is everything"" ... Now I'm not normally this way but the words just blurted out ""great no thanks to you, can you go get the other waitress""?.  Our bill came to $140... A 20% tip would have been $26... I slipped the REAL waitress another $10 instructing her again to not share it. Now she had a total of $20.. I left the original girl $6, and she is very lucky she got that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4?start=20

Chaviva G.,"Denver, CO",407,298,140,5.0,2/26/2009,"I love, love, love the Chili's menu. For a chain restaurant, you can really go all out here, without breaking the bank, and you get a delicious, flavorful meal.  I was craving Chili's -- more specifically, I was craving their bottomless chips and salsa basket (for $2.99, this is a STEAL), so I convinced the boyfriend to go. Paired with a margarita, it was the perfect start to our evening meal. The salsa is definitely spicy, and the chips are almost light and flaky in your mouth. The margarita, just your classic style, had the perfect kick and a nice amount of salt.  I ordered the Margarita Chicken, which came with black beans and a Spanish rice and homemade pico de gallo. The portion was, in a word, HUGE. The black beans were lightly seasoned, and the rice with the beans was outstanding. The chicken, flavored with margarita stylings and atop the rice/beans and topped with the pico, was hot and cooked just enough to make it incredibly juicy.  Overall, the meal was outstanding, delicious, and even though I ate way too much ... I still have lovely memories of that meal :) The waitress was the friendliest waitress I've probably ever had, and she was INCREDIBLY attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4?start=60
Evan G.,"New York, NY",45,332,35,4.0,2/26/2009,"Typically I am not a huge fan of the Chili's chain. I have never previously been very impressed with their food. My gauge many times of a place is their chicken fingers (yes I still eat like a kid sometimes). To me the kind of chicken fingers they make at Chili's is just disgusting. I have been to this location a few times after theater performances because we want to go out and get a beer. I would typically just have my beer and munch on some of the $2.99 bottomless chips that are very good. Last night the girl wanted to go there for dinner so I agreed and we went. I many times when we go out will get a buffalo chicken sandwich (they are just so good!), so when I saw them listed on their slider menu I started searching for a regular sized one. Much to my surprise they had on their guiltless entrees menu a buffalo chicken sandwich. Lately when I get a buffalo sandwich I have been asking for it grilled instead just to be a bit healthier. I was pleasantly surprised to see that their sandwich was already grilled, so I didn't need to worry about my order being messed up. Of course, since I cant go completely healthy I did sub fries for the vegetables, but that's just me being me. The sandwich didn't come with very much sauce on it, so the waitress very willingly and quickly brought an extra side of it for me. Between the sandwich and the bottomless chips it was way more food than I probably should have had, but it was definitely reasonably priced and quite enjoyable. Do I dare say she might have converted me to a Chili's fan??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4?start=60

BIG MISTAKE......almost missed the funeral the next day, we were all sooooo very ill. Sounds like that are not meant to be experienced..... gurgling around in a human body. Not being gross here, i'm literally just talking about the actual gurgling sounds u could hear thru our bellies.  The rest u can imagine on your very own.  The family was thanking their lucky stars they ate elsewhere, as they could hear our stomachs from 2 rooms away! Not sure what exactly poisoned us, but OMG it was the worst.  Have never, nor will we ever, eat at another Chili's again....yuck! I have always suspected the 'fat free' sour cream they use (u have no choice in the matter, thats is ALL they have, for sour cream is the fat free variety.... anyway, Tony Romas is a great ribs place, and Red Robin is great for burgers.....sooo many other places have awesome Margaritas....so right there, i have eliminated the need for anyone to visit a chilis!

Food is never soggy or cold by the time we get home (10 min drive) Definitely recommended for take-out, at least.

John R.,"Amherst, MA",90,246,38,2.0,5/3/2009,"First of all, let me start off by saying that I like to cook. I take pride in what I cook and how I cook it. When I cook for friends, I cook as if my reputation is on the line because quite frankly it is. So when I go out to eat, I expect that if I am paying for a meal, the vendor that I am paying is going to take care in not only what they cook, but how it is served. I have been to this Chili's about three times in the last year. Twice alone, and once with my wife. The time I was with my wife probably would have rate 3 stars but sadly, the other two times would have resulted in a single star. Hence the 2 star rating above.  The two times that I was alone, I sat at the bar. Both times were during lunch and with different bartenders. When I sat down I was the only one sitting at the bar and each time was left sitting there for about 5 minutes before anyone approached me. After what I felt was a longer than normal wait time, my food arrived cold...on both visits! There was no reason for this other than poor server attention to detail. Once me food was served, I was never asked if everything was all right. Finally, once finished and my dishes removed, another chance to ask me if everything was alright was missed yet again.  I live in the area so I don't have to travel far to come here but I will never do so again.

Stacy L.,"Conway, NH",0,5,,1.0,12/16/2016,"So we were traveling through and stopped in at around 1:30 Thursday afternoon.  There wasn't many cars in the parking lot.  We just wanted a quick bite.  The first thing I noticed was that the grounds were nasty with garbage all around the front door and all through the parking lot.  We entered and there was no hostess.  We saw no waitstaff.  We waited for about 5 minutes before seating ourselves in the bar area...no bartender there either.  In the meantime a party of 3 came in and were waiting to be seated by the invisible host as well.  We continued to wait..and wait...before finally seeing a waitress emerge from the kitchen where apparently lots of fun was being had.  In the meantime, the party of 3 had left.  So we were the only party in the bar area.  She took our order for drinks, a draught beer and a water with lemon.  The waitress doesn't go to the bar...no no... she goes back to her friends in the kitchen.  Waited 10 minutes for that ONE beer and a water with lemon...no lemon...We ordered food.  I ordered a garden salad and my boyfriend ordered a burger and fries.  15 minutes passes, 20 minutes...in the meantime another party had come in and had not been acknowledged.  Two people came in to get their to go orders...also had gone unnoticed....Anyhow, food came out after about 45 minutes.  No fries for my boyfriend.  Waitress said that they weren't ready.  She didn't come back for 30 minutes when she brought the check.  We told her that she never brought the fries that were part of the burger meal.  She laughed.  Yes laughed.  We complained to her that we were disappointed and asked her to comp some of our bill.  She comped us $2.32.  Wow.  She was bar far the worst waitress that I have ever seen, and traveling for work, I have seen some very poor waitstaff, but this girl takes the crown.  Food was lousy, service was nearly nonexistent, and common sense and professionalism went down the tubes.  Oh I should also mention that she had barely burnt her finger...that's what happens when you don't pay attention and do your job...but she soaked it in some water with a paper towel and dripped it in peoples food.  Horrible horrible horrible.  Wont ever return to that crap shoot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-manchester-4?start=40

Tom C.,"Ellington, CT",52,99,58,3.0,9/2/2013,"With so many other options in Manchester and surrounding towns, Chili's is often overlooked as a dining out option.  I travel a lot for work so I often pick Chili's when traveling when I want a known entity rather than being surprised by what could be great or could be terrible at non-chain restaurants.  That said, you know what you're gonna get when you go to Chili's. We stopped in on the way to the movies across the street.  Service was quick and efficient on a Saturday early afternoon.  Drinks came out right away.  Food was brought out hot and sizzling (I ordered the fajitas of course!).  As is Chili's standard practice, they only brought out 3 (very small) tortillas to go with the heaping plate of sizzling steak, peppers, and onions, so I had to ask for extras which our waitress brought out right away.  It's a shame they don't bring out 4 tortillas to begin with... that's all I ever use so having to ask for extras means 2 go to waste! The food is A-OK.  It's not great, it's not gourmet, but it's a standard all its own.  For a quick, tasty bite before heading to the theater, it did the trick!

Andrew T.,"Tolland, CT",0,2,,2.0,3/6/2015,"Tortilla chip appetizer where all the chips were mostly broken and crumbs. The salsa was not very flavourful. The fajitas looked like they came out of a can. The enchiladas tasted microwaved and soaked in grease, but I guess you wouldn't be going here to satisfy any reasonably high expectations anyway. Everything felt too overseasoned, too salty, and generally bland (when you weren't getting hit by grease and too much seasoning). I could probably find a recipe for these online and make them A. more authentically, B. Cheaper C. better tasting.  They also have this weird attempt now at requiring a server to ""make"" guacamole at your table and honestly it's really unnecessary. They kind of just mix a paste awkwardly at your table, in something that I think the employee is required to do even if the customer doesn't want it necessarily hand made in front of them .

Our waitress would not check in when we needed her, and to put the cherry on top, she was RUDE! She blatantly ignored our request for help with the Ziosk. She was too busy socializing with her co-workers to do so. She continued to ignore my friends, and because of this they were pretty much forced to pay in cash. After two attempts to get her attention, she got 'annoyed' with us butting in on her conversation. I'm sorry, but my friends and I were ready to PAY AND LEAVE!

(If you've read my White Hut review you'd know that THOSE are my favorite burgers, but they're a different style burger altogether.) Drinks:  The margaritas are naturally better at Margarita's then here.  They're very sweet (too much so really).  We tried all the flavors and passed them around and what not, they were all pretty tasty (Strawberry, Mango, Raspberry, Regular), but I question that they put any alcohol in at all, despite carding us when we ordered...
