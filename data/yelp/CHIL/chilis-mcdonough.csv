Renee F.,"Phenix City, AL",5,14,40,3.0,8/1/2017,Enjoyed the new black bean and veggie fajita. Service was quite slow despite the few clients seated. I ordered the fried pickles but sent them back because they tasted like fried cucumbers minus the pickling process.  I have frequented this establishment before and it's usually top notch. Not sure as to the reason behind the slow process and bad pickling today. Of course I will give them another chance later in the year to make sure this was a one time thing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
LaTyess H.,"Morrow, GA",25,70,176,2.0,7/30/2017,"Went to Chillis this past Friday and omg service was horrible. It was crowded which is expected for a Friday night our server seemed like a nice guy but he was extremely slow. I don't know if he was overwhelmed or what but we had to constantly keep reminding him of stuff ""hey you never brought us any napkins""... ""Hey, can we please put our order in now"".. Or ""hey can you please bring my nephew a kids menu"". He took so long for the kid's menu I ended up walking to the servers desk myself and grabbing the kids menu and the crayons to go along with it. Every time we stopped him and ask for something he would say oh sure give me one second... Dude how many damn seconds do you need?  The food was pretty good and the drinks were watered down. I basically paid 12 dollars each for two glasses of water with ice in a margarita glass. If you decide to go here for just drinks don't do it. Just go to a bar afterwards. If you're coming for just the food that's a good idea, the food was delicious. It's a great place for lunchtime. Hopefully, that particular server was just having a bad day. It happens to all us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Meg E.,"Inman Park, Atlanta, GA",41,63,89,3.0,10/7/2016,"I use to like chili's but I don't think we will be back. My husband and I ordered from the 2/$20 menu. We both got the 6 oz sirloin. I added a half order of seared shrimp for $2.99. I got a side of steamed broccoli and a side salad as my two sides.  I'll include a pic, but the shrimp was so small and not exactly seared but just cooked and kind of slimy to be real. The steak was suppose to be medium rare was well done. The broccoli was 100% raw uncooked. Like broccoli you would get on a vegi tray at a baby shower I'm serious.  I would come here if I were wanting to go somewhere for fun mixed drinks with friends. Or to watch a game at the bar.... maybe. I would not come here for the food only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Tammy K.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,25,49,1.0,9/6/2017,"Arrived just before 9pm and the bar was a mess, where we wanted to sit. The hostess did clean a table for us so that was nice. We ordered and our bartender came to tell us they were out of turkey. So much for the turkey club. Skip coming here. It's not worth it. They really need to up their cleaning abilities.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Shane M.,"McDonough, GA",82,48,95,2.0,5/1/2017,"The food is just ok, nothing too interesting but the wait staff is friendly and the bar area has plenty of tv's to have a drink and watch a game",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Michelle B.,"Hampton, GA",0,20,,4.0,7/16/2017,I enjoy this Chilis. My only complaint is that the server didn't point out the special 2/$20 deal. The items we ordered were on that deal and we ended up paying so much more.  Food is always consistent and good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
AnnMarie J.,"McDonough, GA",4,12,9,3.0,3/22/2017,"Ordered curbside (to-go), cashier was really friendly,(her shift was ending shortly), food was ready in the stated time. I tried the new Oreo Lava Cake, did not like...I'll stick with the original henceforth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Jenniver S.,"Sandy Springs, GA",17,70,184,3.0,7/12/2015,"I placed a online order for curbside service. I arrived at 7pm and waited on my car for 10 minutes. I got tired of waiting so I walked inside. I asked the cashier Erica if they were no longer doing curbside? She said no because I get too busy and can't see the cars. Well that's odd considering that I was the only car parked in CURBSIDE PARKING, when I placed my order online I was asked what type of vehicle AND my receipt clearly states CURBSIDE. Of course by the time I get home my food is cold. I WILL NOT RETURN instead I will go to O'Charleys because they do have curbside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Daniel B.,"McDonough, GA",3,9,,1.0,12/26/2016,"We just got back from chili's.. And there was a wait of 45mins to get in, but we got in little less than 15m which is awesome. The food was good, and fair. I tried the hottest thing on the menu and it really wasn't spicy, and theres no peppers beside food items on there menu.... so idk what I want.(please fix this for spicy lovers).... But the thing that got me is they had ipads on tables, and I was just tinkering with it, but they charged me for games... like 2.59$ (which I was just skimmiging through when sitting waiting for food......... but I had no window with no terms an agreement for touching it.)  I get paying for atmosphere but THEY mean it apparently.... chillis let me down for a slipped fee...... and menu items, other than that its fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Josh A.,"Stockbridge, GA",0,2,,1.0,6/4/2017,Horrible. Dirty tables left uncleaned while guests waited on a wait list. Sat down and got no service. Someone finally came by got us drinks them disappeared. Only saw 2 servers in the entire restaurant. We have eaten here before but will not be coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Latonya F.,"Hampton, GA",0,2,,1.0,5/25/2017,"I will never go back!!!!!! The lemonade taste like dirty water. I should I got up and left right then. I ordered the salmon meal, one hour later I got food poisoning :'(  :'(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough

Jay T.,"Fayetteville, GA",31,74,627,2.0,7/21/2015,Lunch with my daughter. Ordered plain pasta with grilled chicken and nachos. 40 minutes to get the food to us. Manager did come over and let us know that the nachos took longer than expected. Other than the long wait and having to leave with our food in boxes everything was ok,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Keturah N.,"Hampton, GA",31,7,,3.0,6/19/2016,"My husband and I came here for his Father's day lunch, and he left not happy at all and feeling like the waiter was insinuating that he was lying. He used his Chili's app that HAD 100 points on it and was going to get a free dessert but somehow when trying to use it, it deleted his 100 points and the dessert we had to pay for. The manager told the waiter what to do but apparently it didn't work, and he said IF the app was suppose to give him a free dessert he didn't know why it didn't go through. My husband got fed up because our points were deleted even though it didn't work and said we'd pay for it so we did and left. The food was good except for my broccoli which was raw but warm, not steamed at all. Trying to decide if we ever want to go back again or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Kimberly N.,"Jackson, GA",11,10,,1.0,11/7/2016,"It's not like I expect some high end meal and top end service at Chilis, but I do expect prompt, attentive service and decent, hot food served in a reasonable time frame.  The place was relatively slow at lunchtime but our waitress was completely oblivious that drinks were empty (admittedly a huge pet peeve of mine) and that our food (2 lunch sandwiches and an appetizer) was taking a really REALLY long time to come out.  When it did, my burger was way over cooked and there were literally 11 room temperature French fries on the plate (I'm serious).  My wife's BLT looked like it came from a gas station and if I looked hard enough I could make out the 2 tiny pieces of bacon on it.  She did, however, have a few more of the not so hot fries, so she had that going for her.  Anyway, this used to be a place we would come and get the 2 for $20 dinner deal because it was decent and a change of pace but the last couple of times it's been bad and I think we are done going.   We will spend our time and money elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
John C.,"McDonough, GA",18,2,,3.0,5/27/2016,Craving ribs and had a coupon for extra Chili's points for ordering ribs. 6:00 pm on Friday night. They said the ribs won't be ready for two hours.  They are usually pretty good though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Keya B.,"Marietta, GA",4,32,6,5.0,2/21/2015,"I have been coming to this Chili's location for years. I am not sure why there are bad reviews. This location has never disappointed me. Unlike the Kennesaw location where servers are just plain rude and hostile. But here, the always serve with a smile. My favorites are the Spinach Dip and The Triple Berry Margarita is the best ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Danielle C.,"McDonough, GA",13,2,,1.0,7/1/2015,"Absolutely disgusting - is there a negative rating? Had the quesadilla explosion salad. One bite seemed to have a minty flavor & extra chewy lettuce - until I realized I was chewing someone else's GUM!!! Have never been so disgusted in my life! Manager & waitress were both very nice about it, but told me that ""neither of the two people making salads were chewing gum."" Naw duh- it was in my salad!! Will never eat Chili's ever again!uh",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Keirsten F.,"McDonough, GA",80,3,,1.0,1/22/2016,"Horrible service. Server walked past our table numerous times when our drinks were empty and plates stacked from our app. Asked for mayo for our burgers and didn't come back with it until the end of our meal. Our appetizer was fried pickles but there was just more fried batter than pickles. As a previous server at 3 dollar cafe, this is not at all how customers should be treated. My manager would've handed me my own tail. I understand things get hectic if it's busy, but the place was almost empty. There is absolutely no reason for the experience we had eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Sandy W.,"Hampton, GA",0,24,10,1.0,6/11/2016,Chili's has never been my favorite restaurant but my mother had a Chili's gift card that she wanted to use. So we came to this Chili's today. I ordered the margarita chicken. The chicken was rubbery and did not taste fresh. The beans were horrible. I've ordered this dish before and it was decent but this time I had to send it back. I now hate sending meals back because you just don't know what you will get in place of it.  But I could not eat this at all. I ordered the baby back ribs and these were dry and overcooked with very little meat on it and it was plastered with BBQ sauce (and I hope nothing else). The appetizers were decent.  Chili's is a place to get drinks and appetizers. Don't expect a decent meal. The waitress and hostess were very nice but that's it.  I don't think I will return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough
Patricia M.,"Hampton, GA",0,27,31,4.0,9/6/2015,I ordered take out this time visiting chilis. After waiting 10minutes (I ordered to pickup at 1) I received my order within 10 minutes then waited another 5 for my dessert. The food was room temp when I got where I was going. Overall I wish my food had been made within the time I was going to pick it up. I also wish my food wasn't just sitting there when I arrived and told to wait 5 minutes (yes I saw it sitting in the kitchen when I arrived not knowing it was mine). Who knows how long it was there. I ordered the honey chipotle chicken and Texas fries. Some of the chicken was a little over cooked. I like this chilis restaurant and I usually have good service when I visit. I'll go back as it is one of the few non-fast food places  I like to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough?start=20
Kristin A.,"Hampton, GA",16,9,1,3.0,11/22/2015,Ordered takeout and had to wait nearly an hour for a burger. Worried my other food might be cold because I had to wait on the burger. They were nice and gave my a larger drink for free. Food is always great when we come but tonight was kind of a miss. Especially since they said they were running out of food... Better luck next time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough?start=20
Brett O.,"Decatur, GA",8,4,1,1.0,2/15/2015,Worst Chilis I have ever been too! They brought out fajitas and didn't bring the tortillas for about 10 minutes later and potato soup came out cold and Southwestern egg rolls tasted like they just reheated an old order. I definitely will not eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough?start=20
April C.,"Stockbridge, GA",3,11,,1.0,1/1/2015,"Every time I come here, I remember why I tell myself not to and of course, today was no different. I attended this establishment with a group of friends. We ordered and received our drinks smoothly, however...that was the last time we saw our waitress, she never came the entire time we were there to refill our drinks nor, check on us. The appetizer took forever, and came with our entrees we ordered. What was the point of having a appetizer? And of course the food was disgusting. We asked for a manager and he was rude and disrespectful. But did grant us a ""no charge"" for some of us in the group whose food were to nasty to even eat.   I will not come to this chilies again, I've gone to others and they we're never as bad as this one. Every time I come here, it's never a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough?start=20
Ray Q.,"Hampton, GA",41,148,356,3.0,6/3/2013,"Great location just off I-75 and convenient to all shopping as well as many other restaurants. I ordered the Guacamole Burger medium that features jalapenos, spicy cheese, and bun. The burger was fantastic and well worth the price. The only negative at this place was that the manager decided to send the hostess home (discipline issue) and the service suffered greatly-poor decision on managers part. The overall experience here was good and my server in particular was attentive; however, very busy due to the hostess being sent home. Deducted 2 stars for this issue alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough?start=20
Patrick M.,"Stockbridge, GA",20,19,4,1.0,8/1/2012,"My burger came out wrong and when I told the server about it, she picked up my bun to see if it was wrong...which it was and then said sorry and walked off.

Darren H.,"Atlanta, GA",95,1030,517,3.0,6/19/2012,"This place has always been hit or miss for me.  I'm not a huge fan of the chain restaurants but sometimes it's your only option or you just have a craving for a certain thing on their menu.  For me it was location & I knew they would be showing the game [Celtics/Heat].  Whenever I stop in & stay the service has always been good, drinks strong and everything happy, happy.  Whenever I get my food to go it's always like I'm bothering them by coming in to pay for my food and pick it up.  The two sides of the house have to get it together or really I can stop coming in all together.

Ashley K.,"Calera, AL",4,42,6,1.0,3/21/2013,"The worst Chili's experience of my life.  The waitress was completely lost and paid no attention to our table.  Drinks were sitting at the bar for 30 minutes, and she kept blaming the bartender saying the drink wasn't ready yet....YET we were looking at it....for 30 minutes.  Bathrooms were gross, and the clientele....too loud and abrasive.  Not a good experience.  We found several food items in our plates that obviously belonged to other plates.  I.E. lettuce in our french fries, shrimp randomly on a hamburger plate...etc. Will not repeat the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough?start=20

Sarah W.,"McDonough, GA",2,10,,4.0,2/28/2009,"It's your standard Chili's. Pulled in on a Friday night at 6pm - had a thirty minute wait for a table for three. When we got in our waiter was right on it - had some drinks and an app order immediately. Got that part out very quickly. Both my husband and I had the black bean burger off the Guiltless Grill Menu (they'll let you sub out any other side for the steamed veggies if it isn't your thing) I declined any of the normal toppings on mine and just asked to add cheese as did the man. Our daughter got the Mac and Cheese, which sadly was only a buck less then our entree's. When the meals came out the burgers were exactly as ordered, but oddly the fries my husband had substituted for the veggies also were smothered in cheese - the waiter apologized, didn't offer to fix it (apparently knowing that the man LOVES cheese) and we all carried on. No extra charge for the random cheese.  Overall the burgers were good, a little spicy but right. Nothing compared to a veggie burger at Vortex up in Atlanta, but we're talking Chili's here. The only odd thing about the whole experience was that the waiter brought the bill with the entree's. A habit I REALLY dislike. For only $28 before tip not too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcdonough?start=20
