Catherine A.,"McHenry, IL",0,34,2,5.0,5/10/2014,"Even though it's a chain, this Chili's is outstanding.   The service and food are good, but what makes them stand out is they will accommodate any special dietary needs.   Most chains aren't that flexible. I also like that we can get in and out of there during our lunch hour.   We don't have many choices in McHenry, but this is a good one..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3?start=20

Michele G.,"Island Lake, IL",0,11,1,5.0,1/8/2018,We had a great dinner and great service. I wish I would have kept my receipt because our waiter was great. I think his name was Matt. He took good care of us. My husband is a guzzler and his drink was never empty. I added on an item and it was no problem. We usually go to the Vernon Hills location bt we were in the area so figured why not. Glad we stopped it wAs a really good dinner!! Got a lot of food for our money too!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3

Jennie C.,"Fox Lake, IL",0,6,,1.0,8/8/2017,"Tried to eat at Chili's in Mchenry tonight. (We usually drive to the one in gurnee). Tuesday must be a bad night for this location. Slow.... very slow! About 7 tables were seated the place was empty but for some reason, It took 20mins after being seated to finally get a waiter, we put in our drink order and he walked away! We were ready to request both an appetizer and our dinner but we're not given this option. We waited an additional 15 mins for our drinks to arrive, gave up and left. 10 mins to a different restaurant sat down, realized we left a phone at chili's, drove back for the phone and the table had yet to be cleaned (phone was still under the menu where we left it.. so sad as I really enjoy eating at chili's but will not return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Jimmy H.,"Sarasota, FL",0,15,,5.0,6/24/2017,"I always get great service here! Food and drinks are really good, always consistent. Honey chipotle crispers are probably my favorite thing on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Cyndi B.,"McHenry, IL",3,2,,1.0,9/24/2017,"All my favs  have been removed from their new downsized menu. Why Chilis wants to be a burger place is beyond me because we have plenty of burger joints in McHenry. Chilis was at its best when they offered the pick two pairings with various enchiladas and taco choices. My family and I were visiting this place two or three times a week . Then they removed the pick two pairings and we were left with having to order three enchiladas or tacos and paying more money for something we couldn't  finish.  We cut back to once a week visits. Now with this reduced menu,  chilis is no longer offering cheese enchiladas and instead is only offering chicken enchiladas with sour cream. I asked if they had another sauce and I was told no. Not everyone likes sour cream or can eat dairy. Why Chilis wouldn't at least offer green chili sauce is beyond me.  I always thought this place was suppose to be a Tex-Mex restaurant. As far as their ribs, their ribs haven't been good for a couple of years now. Hardly any meat on the ribs. I stopped eating them awhile back. Their plates of enchiladas were always hot to the touch,  but the food was usually lukewarm, but I didn't complain.  Yet this time  I felt it was important to mention to the waitress that I didn't see anything on the menu that would make me want to return. I knew she couldn't do anything about it but I thought she could pass the word to higher management in her next  employee meeting along with other customer's comments. Well instead the manager appears at my table,  gets right in my face and  proceeds to tell me that I am threatening him. He must have argued with me for ten minutes. I shared my thoughts of the new menu and stated a fact that I no longer saw anything on the menu that would make me want to return. No threat, just a statement. Unbelievable! My family and I would have walked out but we had already ordered our drinks. He made us feel like he wanted us to leave right then and there. If we had a male figure at the table, he never would have talked to us in that manner. A manager should make a customer feel good about being there and not act like he could care a less if we eat there or not. He doesn't even know his clientele. He had to hear from the wait staff that we were good customers. ""Were"" is the key word here. I will never return to Chilis in McHenry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Jennifer P.,"Addison, IL",385,946,2328,2.0,10/14/2014,"Mom's pretty into chain restaurants (I think they make her feel safe), so this time I suggested Chili's over Applebees.  Not totally convinced it was the better of the two, though.. Service was slow despite there not being a huge rush - it took at least 10 minutes for anyone to come by after we were seated. We got our drinks and then needed two more minutes to finalize our orders, but 15 went by with our server nowhere to be found.  If you're a vegetarian or like having meatless options that DON'T include a salad, be warned that Chili's is NOT up on the times. Most choices are chicken, chicken, or beef. (And, no, that's not a typo.) A bit of a bright light was an option to sub a turkey patty or a black bean patty on your burger. I got the latter on the Guacamole Burger. When our server finally returned, I ordered a water for my nephew (who had sucked down 90% of his choco milk). Our server was confused taking our order - since my aunt also ordered the Guacamole Burger, he thought she wanted a black bean patty by default since that's what I chose (and that's what she would have gotten had I not caught it). He never came back for refills, including my request for water for the kid. Meh. I don't think places know how to cook a veggie patty. It should have a bit of a crust/sear, not just warmed, since then it's mushy and falls apart.  Mom liked her Bacon Avocado Chicken sandwich, and the kiddo ate some of his hamburger patties, though they were overcooked and dry. His mandarin oranges were plentiful.  In all, total mediocrity, but I've come to kind of expect that. McHenry needs some better family dining options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Annika L.,"WI, WI",19,7,,5.0,2/2/2017,"This is my go to resteraunt. Everything on the menu is delish! From the chips to salsa, to the soup, the drinks are great. The meats are well marinated as they are full of flavor. Everything on the menu is great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Elizabeth D.,"McHenry, IL",13,52,,3.0,4/22/2016,Why do you need five people to stand and page for your seat when you only need one. The menu is at the table. The waitress that was supposed to be at the table didn't show and some other person took over. The way you pay is dumb because the machine died and need a new one. Not everyone wants to pay by credit card some people pay cash.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Ann S.,"Vernon Hills, IL",0,8,1,1.0,3/3/2017,shitty service... ordered original chicken crisper and they were not crispy. they were tempera style and soggy as hell. i asked for a manager and he proceeded to say he would take it off the bill (thanks) BUT he took my whole plate away and wouldn't let me have the fries or corn... and i told him i didn't want them to remake them. well he brought out actual crispy chicken fingers but by then i had lost my appetite so i left with barely any food in my stomach. i would rather go to the crystal lake location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
None Of Your B.,"Fox Lake, IL",0,15,,1.0,8/17/2016,"Slow service, dumb useless waitress that had no clue what is on the menu.  Food is worse than a microwave frozen dinner, overpriced, $15 is a flatbread that is stale with very few toppings.  The atmosphere is dark and gloomy.  Ordered well done burgers and received a bloody mess that was raw on the inside and burnt on the outside.  How is Chilis still in business, a hyaena would not eat there, maybe a starving vulture would, but than it would get sick and vomit.  VOMIT sums up Chili's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Walter J.,"Crystal Lake, IL",126,90,109,4.0,3/7/2015,It's chili's what can you say? They have some new specialty drinks.  A fruit margaritas that is really good.   I think they are trying to eliminate waitresses with there new at the table computer system.  That would be a mistake... folks go out sometimes to be waited on. They also have a really great lunch deal going on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Angie H.,"Chicago, IL",0,17,1,1.0,11/21/2014,"In all fairness I am a fan of Chili's, I like the food and the margaritas.  Whenever I can manage to talk my husband into eating at a chain restaurant this is my treat.  I have to say that I've eaten at this particular location twice and both times the service is slow and inattentive.  It's never particularly busy but there is not a server or a bartender to be found.  I've sat near the bar both times.  Worst of all the food is cold and the ingredients look old, my husband ordered fajitas the beef was overcooked.  They brought my husband a drink refill never asked if I wanted one, even when my glass was empty and I asked for one. I am so annoyed with Chilis I submitted a formal complaint to their corporate office and they never replied.  It's obvious why no one cares at this McHenry location since no one cares at their corporate office either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Erika D.,"Genoa City, WI",24,4,,2.0,3/21/2016,"I used to be a big Chili's fan...but I don't remember why.  Went to Chili's for lunch yesturday and was really disappointed.  I ordered fish tacos and my husband order a primerib burritio.  FIsh tacos are my fave but these fish tacos ruined my fave dish for me. I mean they were edible but I won't order them again.  The tilapia was the fishiest tasting tilapia I have ever had and the tacos were really dry.  There was some kind of spicy red sauce on them but not enough to keep them from getting stuck like dry bread in my mouth.  The cabbage on the taco was also very dry and hard to chew.  I was expecting the cabbage to be doused in some kind of tangy, citrusy, sweet cream based sauce as every other fish taco I have ever had has been.  I brought them home and made my own dressing to put on them.   My husband loves burritos and he loves prime rib...but this prime rib burrito was not to his liking...he picked at it but in the end only made 1/4 of it disappear which the waitress noticed and offered to get it removed from the bill but we denied.  The burrito just had too much going on and all of the flavors clashed, the ""prime rib"" tasted like stew meat or pot roast.  Oddly enough my father had this same dish last time they went to chili's and he said the same thing....this was not prime rib. My daughter got two chicken sandwiches and corn on the cob off the kids meal.  She barely touched the corn because it didn't taste like anything.   I will say that their over priced drinks are always yummy though. After our visit my husband remembered why he never wants to go to chili's...Olive Garden all the way!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Justin G.,"McHenry, IL",10,167,11,2.0,12/9/2014,"Chili's was never one of my favorites, but I never minded coming to the McHenry location in the past.  Well, about a month ago I visited here for the first time in about a year and a half, and it's safe to say that I probably won't be back.  Service was worse than ever, and I do not like the menu change that they implemented.  Granted the 'craft' burgers sound good, but they removed a lot of my favorite menu items such as the broccoli and cheese soup and the chicken fried steak just to name a few.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Nicole R.,"Wonder Lake, IL",0,4,,1.0,4/16/2016,"I visit the chilis in crystal lake all the time. After being seated we were greeted by our server and ordered our drinks, but before getting our drinks he decided to joke with another female waitress. After about 5 minutes we got our drinks and still hadn't decided what to eat yet so we ordered chips and salsa, this is where I started getting upset. The waiter walks by my table 4 times and we were the only table in his area and i finally said something to catch his attention and ordered. My girlfriend had then at the same time ordered a side of guacamole and we received both and we had then prepared to order. At the time of ordering I had remembered a few nights back I had order to-go from this location and had gotten a 2 for 18.99 deal. I asked the waiter about it and his response was, ""I'm sorry, We don't have that we have 2 for $20."" I had then relayed the message of, ""I just ordered that here a few nights ago."" He then proceeded to get the manager. After the manager comes by I remembered he was the same manager on call from the other night when the computers were down that helped the customer in front of me. So I again asked the same question and the response was pretty shocking. ""I was on duty the night the computers went down, and No we do not have a 2 for 18.99 we only have 2 for 20, you must be mistaken that I gave you a few dollars off due to the inconvenience."" He then proceeded to walk away. So I ordered and proceeded to enjoy the appetizer. Then everything got very interesting. My girlfriend looks at me and hands me a piece of guacamole, I then told her how I don't like it. Well she put it on the plate and there were chunks of steak in the guacamole. Now note we had not gotten any food yet with any type of meat in it. So I then asked the waiter, ""After receiving my food why there was steak."" His response was we prepare everything from meat to vegetables on the same area, so it happens. He then proceeded to say he will grab the manager. I ate my cold fries and dinner. The waiter returned to tell us he took the guacamole off the bill. We asked why didn't the manager come out. His response ""My manager is in the back taking care of business, and as you can see we are tremendously busy. (Note we are 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant.) and he told me to take it off your bill."" So needless to say the manager probably left for the night or just didn't want to handle his own business. I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Caroline P.,"San Diego, CA",165,408,111,3.0,5/29/2012,"It's Chili's. Home of the family night out, date night, and margarita meet-up. What I like about Chili's is that they have some gluten free options, and are one of the few places in McHenry that do. Ask for the gluten allergy list and talk to your server about your needs.

Salena A.,"Spring Grove, IL",0,3,3,2.0,4/1/2015,"Food is ok... Restaurant was Clean... But showed up during shift change... So we were forgotten... No biggie... Enjoyed our lunch paid with there little kiosk thing... Realized we were the only ones seated on that side of the restaurant and we had again been forgotten... No refills on drinks... Finally got up to go get some to go boxes and asked for a chips and salsa to go... Gave us the boxes but never gave us the chips... Still never came to check on us... Finally asked for the chips and salsa again and asked if we could have a bag to put our  to go boxes in... And could  hear our waitress go in the back and complain that we had asked for a bag... ""now they want a bag to put it in"" this all happened after we had filled out the questionnaire saying that we had gotten good service and tipped 25%... But the waitress was put out that we wanted a bag... So I can say for us we won't be going back... I don't like their food that much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mchenry-3
Jim T.,"Marengo, IL",10,229,81,3.0,8/20/2011,"What can I say if you wanted Wendy's you would go there if you want Chili's you come here. The hostess and wait staff did not make me feel warm and fuzzy.  They have some new electronic gadget that takes the personalization away from the wait staff. I just see it as downsizing the staff and less face time with them. Boo! corporate America. Our waitress brought me a 2nd drink after I said no thank you. I thought I would try the new tablet on the table for paying the bill. Hmm.... I am still looking for the slot that takes cash.
