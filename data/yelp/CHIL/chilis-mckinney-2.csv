Tiffani R.,"Dallas, TX",126,6,,4.0,11/6/2017,"Checked out the new menu tonight. Had the southern smokehouse burger with fries and the skillet queso. I think they need to go back to the drawing board with the skillet queso. It tastes like canned cheese with a can of Wolf chili. Very bland and does not look appetizing BUT the burger so made up for the blah app. Nailed it. It was so good. I was never wowed before with their burgers although they were never bad. Just mediocre. They've done their homework. Bravo Chili's!!  Burger was juicy, bun was soft with a good taste, the produce was fresh, bacon was crisp and the sauce was spot on. Not sure what it was called. Secret sauce maybe?  Anyway, kudos on the burgers! ( fries were good too). We will definitely be back and won't wait so long next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2
Kaley V.,"Allen, TX",51,4,5,1.0,10/14/2017,"Got here at 7:30 and just now at 8:10 got our food. Haven't had a single person come by to refill drinks or see if everything is correct and it isn't. Have asked two people for what we need and still don't have it. Service is optional here.  Also when food came...the blue cheese was boiling hot, almost a gravy. The bone in wings with buffalo has no sauce and taste like bacon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2
Arjun B.,"McKinney, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/26/2017,"Horrible experience! My family came to get a quick dessert to go! And they failed to let us know that any hot desserts they have aren't given hot to go... we only bought it to eat on the road not at home. Before we left the lot we went back to ask them if they could kindly warm it up but they said they don't do that with to go orders. The women would not let us inside and was yelling at us through the doors, definitely wouldn't have too much of an inconvenience to warm up our $20 dessert not to mention we left them a generous tip, I would not recommend this chili's. It may be in a nice area but nothing nice about the staff inside. Going to 380 and 75 next time, never have had a problem with to go orders there. Staff was rude. Food was disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2

Virginia G.,"Orange Park, FL",9,7,,2.0,6/23/2017,"Prefacing this with saying that they were busy tonight. But still. Ordered drinks at happy hour, but waiter forgot to ring it in until I asked where it was and then I missed HH price. The quest dip sat under the warmer so long that the guac turned brown and there was a hard layer of cheese on top of queso. Entrees came out and had obviously (again) sat under warmer. The kids queso was so ridiculous; it was burned cheese and what looked like tortilla toast. The tacos were cold and grease was dripping off of it. The cx on the buffalo chicken salad was cold and dry. The only saving grace was the hot fries. The whole experience was a disappointment for a chilis and we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2

Khanh T.,"McKinney, TX",12,20,37,4.0,12/13/2016,"Stopped by for lunch as I wanted to try the new Smokehouse Combo.  Lots of food for lunch.  I could only eat half; took the rest home for a second meal.  The smoked meat was better than some local BBQ eateries so I was pleasantly surprised.  The sausage was tasty, with just the right amount of heat.  The BBQ sauce was excellent with a nice vinegar base.  My only complaint is that the toast and dry rub on the ribs was a little salty.  Overall good meal .... 8/10; service was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2

Ryan P.,"McKinney, TX",15,7,,2.0,9/5/2016,"This used to be one of our top places to head to for dinner since we moved out here to McKinney. The food quality and service were usually pretty consistent and you could usually count on a good experience here. The past year or so the restaurant has declined. Every single time we've been here the past few months there have been issues with our food. Steaks well done instead of medium, missing orders, incorrect orders, lukewarm good, slow service, etc. We keep giving them one more shot to get it right but it just hasn't happened. I'm giving two stars because the dishes that haven't been incorrect have been decent and they have a decent variety of food and good chocolate shakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2
Phoebe D.,"McKinney, TX",31,4,,5.0,8/26/2016,"The staff were super helpful and nice as usual!  I almost always get the chicken bacon ranch quesadillas and they are the  ! Tonight at this location they were even better than usual, I don't know who the chef was tonight but he was on point! I got the chips, salsa and quacamole and that was also on point tonight! The margaritas are all amazing and I'm pretty sure I've tried them all over my many visits to chili's locations.  The only thing I've ever tried at chili's that I wasn't a huge fan of, was the burgers and it was only because I didn't really like the buns they used.  Over all, chili's is my favorite restaurant because I always leave so happy because it's such a fun environment, I love the food and the people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2
Cheddar J.,"The Colony, TX",1,1,,1.0,7/28/2016,"I just picked up To-Go.  I ordered online and I had selected to have the food brought out to me (as I was on a tight work schedule).  I even tipped 15% on the online order, to go to the person bringing me out the food.   I get there 3 mins before the email told me it would be ready.  I waited 5 mins after the time listed and went inside where I had to wait an additional 7 mins for the bartender to gather everything (It was clear my order was not ready even when I walked inside) I was supposed to receive pickles on the side, did not receive them.   I was supposed to have Blue Cheese on the side, not sauce on the side.  The $1 (2 oz.) Queso I paid for was less than half full and was seemingly the reason my whole order was not put together when I arrived, because I was asked about if I 'was sure that is what I wanted' .   This was an experience that will prevent me from ever ordering from here for lunch again.  This is not my family's regular Chili's, so I do not see myself ever coming by this location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2

Ashley J.,"McKinney, TX",111,6,,2.0,8/3/2016,Very disappointed with the service. Second time to bring my boys here during lunch hour and had issues both times. The first time we were sat towards the back and listened to the wait staff yell at their manager for not making enough money during lunch.  The second time my boys and I sat for 10+ minutes before we were ever approached by a waiter. They weren't even full or during a rush. And then I watched another waitress walk up to a table and tell them to just order food through the console on the table. She didn't have time to take their order.  The food is decent but the experience is lacking  will be looking elsewhere for lunch spots for the kids and me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2
Gar S.,"McKinney, TX",93,275,1445,4.0,8/21/2014,"I like Chili's and have been going for years. This one is in a good location and is nice and clean. Service was okay but not great. We ate at the bar area, not at the bar. The waiter took our order and every time after we got our food, he just kind of ran by out table asking if we needed anything. I know he was busy but the place wasn't packed full of people. Not a huge deal, but he could have taken a few minutes with us. The reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because the bun my hamburger was on was so very stale! I love their burgers, but having a really stale hamburger bun is the worst! This is not the first time this has happened at Chili's. Life goes on but it's just annoying not to have a fresh hamburger bun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2
Nitin S.,"Lewisville, TX",5,65,15,2.0,10/1/2015,"Meh is the best way to describe this place. Our kids love Chillis else I'd never even step into this place. Our last trip here the waitress was amazingly helpful especially since we had a party of 12. But the food just leaves so much to be desired...devoid of flavor or originality or freshness (strange considering they are running an ad campaign about it) The bill at 300 dollars for the party of 12 (6 kids with kids meals, no alcohol across the board) was outrageously expensive. Hate to say it but given the kids liking it and it's convenient location - we will probably still go there occasionally",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2

Sarah M.,"McKinney, TX",37,58,76,4.0,7/11/2016,"My waiter misheard when I said cheese enchiladas and brought me chicken instead. He quickly corrected this however and I did not have to wait long for the replacement dish. The manager came out and checked up on us to make sure we were ok. They definitely took care of it. However, when I tried to pay my bill on the ziosk (that thing on your table that you swipe your card on) it told me that a twenty percent tip on a $34 bill was over $8. At first I thought it was some sort of gimmick to make people over-tip without thinking. The waiter wasn't sure either at first. He came back later and said that he figured it out. He said that it was calculating the tip based on the original chicken enchiladas dish he has brought out. It had been voided from the bill, but the tip meter was still calculating the tip like it was part of the bill in addition to the other replacement dish he brought. Long story short, double check the tip meter. The people, service, and food are good and everything came out promptly. A genuine attempt was made by management and staff to correct any mistakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2

I do this, honestly, more than I'd like to admit because there are just days my husband and I just aren't in the mood to cook. They have great deals all the time, and the 2 for $20 gets us in and out and well-fed for not a lot of money.  They only lose a star because there have been one or two times that the order was wrong (I just check everything before I leave now) or it wasn't quite ready by the time it said it would be.

What have they done?  Ick. I took 3 bites then decided it wasn't worth the calories. Same thing with the queso. What was that thick brown goop?  Gross. I don't even think it had cheese in it?  Nevertheless, the chips and salsa rocked and the French fries were perfect. My son loved his chipotle chx crispers. Our server was awesome!  Great job Tyler!  The place was clean and very busy but we were still seated right away.  The host was slammed but still friendly and kept his cool. They have a fun new gadget at each table with lots of games. And u can pay your tab. It even calculates your tip!  At the end of the day we will always go back.

Julie S.,"Frisco, TX",108,69,11,5.0,7/16/2012,"Ok, it's Chili's- not a typical 5 star kinda place. Please hear me out and have an open mind. First off... The food at this location is consistantly good. It's our kid's favorite place to eat, and the staff always go out of their way to make the kids feel special. When my 5 year old ordered her cheeseburger and ""cob on the corn"" our server never missed a beat.  The service here is really what makes me come back again and again and again. Took my daughter to lunch the other day. It was clear that there was a staffing shortage in the kitchen- I think only 2 cooks showed up. So the orders took a little longer than usual. It was no big deal to us because we had no where to be and I told my server to relax... we were fine. The food was good and staff friendly and ever-apologizing even after I told them no worries. Here's the kicker... I was waiting for the check when my server came over to inform me that it was all on the house. Really? I was stunned. Of course I tipped him and told him that it really wasn't necessary but I was really beyond grateful for the service. I've been to 5 star restaurants where the staff behave like the patrons should feel lucky to be in the same room with them.  This Chili's- corner of 121 and Custer- is really doing something very well. Very little turnover with the wait staff and they really know how to do their jobs.

I really enjoyed their queso despite the fact that I am impossibly picky about cheese. I am giving minus one star because my burger could have been a little rarer, but I don't come to Chili's with terribly high expectations so I was satisfied with the medium to medium-rare patty that I received. What I really appreciated was our waiter--he was very attentive. I decided in the middle of eating my fries that I wanted a side of ranch. I turned around only to see him walking off and I thought that I had lost him. But then he came back and asked if I needed something--as if he had eyes in the back of his head!

Our waiter (Kenny, I think?) was nice and brought our drinks promptly. We ended up ordering the $20 dinner for two deal which includes an appetizer plus 2 entrees. We had both chosen entrees that were on the list for that that anyway, and the price was a dollar cheaper with the deal, plus we got an appetizer. We got the onion strings & fried jalapeños for our app, which tasted pretty good, although some were a little too doughy. The jalapeños were fresh, not pickled like the ones that TGI's used to have, but were still good. I got the Margarita  Grilled chicken, which I've had before at the Frisco location and really liked. The beans and rice were good, but the chicken was extremely bland. Otherwise, everything else was great.

Derek B.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",6,2,,4.0,10/20/2011,"First off, I agree. Chili's is a chain and as such, you don't except some of the things you would at a higher end or privately owned restaurant. There's always the proverbial crying child, obnoxious couple, or terrible service. However on my trip to Chili's yesterday I was both impressed and later a little annoyed and I will explain why. Atmosphere(3/5): Not much to say. It's Chili's you either love it or hate it. Food(5/5): Chili's is one of those places where I go for one certain dish. I don't go crazy I don't try anything new because once you find something you like at a chain it's best to eat it while it lasts. My particular favorites are starting with Skillet Queso and some fried jalapeños (yum!). After that I usually get Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers with two sides of Loaded Mashed Potatoes. Some times I come on separate occasions for dessert and it is always the Molten Lava Chocolate Cake. All of the above are superb comfort food. Service(5/5): My server was  Brenda and she was by far the best server I have gotten at Chili's I was downright impressed. We got waters and there was none of the snideness some waiters give you when you order water and she dutifully refilled it without exasperation every time I was sucking it down. She got my fried jalapeños without taking an arm and a leg and was willing to work with us when we said we were in a small time crunch. She was friendly and personable but not checking on my table every 30 seconds. In summation she was awesome and I'll probably ask for her every time from now on. On a side note, I did end up leaving my cellphone with Brenda yesterday and since I had work right after I did not think to come and get it the next day. Brenda turned it into her manager and her manager placed it...oh...somewhere. When I called Chili's the next morning frantic about the location of my phone, I was assured it was there and could come pick it up at 10:45AM when the doors were open. That was fine by me and around 10:50 I showed up to retrieve my missing appendage only to be greeted by false sincerity and condescension of the day manager. According to him the manager last night put it somewhere...and he had no idea where it was. Awesome. They knew they had it. They just couldn't find it but I was assured it was safe...wherever it was.  The reason I'm writing this yelp review is not to gush on Brenda it's to call out the asshole manager who spoke to me the next morning. I know in your Chili's management training packet it says something along the lines of ""confront any guest issues"". What it means sir is you fix my problem. YOU DO NOT CONFRONT ME WHEN YOU LOST MY PHONE. I don't care what happened. I don't care what your excuse was. I wanted you in your office looking for my phone because I know the night manager didn't take it home with him so he could play Angry Birds with his kids he had for the day. You should not me asking me what to do and trying to make me feel stupid like a snide asshole you should be figuring out a way to fix my problem. That's what happens in a service industry. Your false sincerity and lack of empathy when I told you I was going to be in surgery for the rest of the day and couldn't wait on your night manager to find my phone. You just give me a bad taste in my mouth for the first time EVER since going to that Chili's and I probably go to this location twice a week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2?start=40

Im not going to waste my time here when there are a million other restaurants out there who want buisness. They are usually dead at this location too. This is definetly a no for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney-2?start=40
