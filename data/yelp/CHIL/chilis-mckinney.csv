Kacey R.,"McKinney, TX",113,190,265,3.0,10/19/2017,"It's Chili's... I mean, that's how I'm starting my review. You can't have super high expectations for the place, but it still gets the job done. I've been coming here for years though (not often, but every now and then). The food is always good. Last time I went, I had their chicken enchilada soup. I've had it before, and it's pretty tasty. You know the go to is Chicken Crispers and their queso which is money. Trying to be ""healthy"", I stuck with the soup on this trip. Our service was very good. We sat in the bar area, and it was pleasant. Had a little issue with the bill being incorrect, but our server got it taken care of quickly. One interesting note, we didn't have cable at the time of the past Presidential Election. We drove around trying to find a spot to watch it. Came to this location, and the bartender said they were not showing it because they didn't want there to be any trouble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
Tonia M.,"Dallas, TX",16,4,,1.0,10/4/2017,We've given this place 3 tries over the last year and have been disappointed every time.  The first visit took over an hour to get food then the food was cold. It was a random Thursday night around 5pm so the place was practically empty. No reason to wait an hour then get cold food. About 2 months ago we went for dinner with our 4 year old. They brought out her food and said ours would be put in less than 5 minutes. 20 minutes later we get our food. My chicken was raw. Sent it back and just asked for a burger since I thought it might be quicker (and didn't want to chance raw chicken again). They brought me a burger ... completely raw!  Tonight I went with my 4 year old. They said they had burned her pizza and needed a few minutes  to make another. 5 minutes later they delivered a half frozen pizza and my salad with raw chicken. Just stay away ... maybe they'll close and we'll get a restaurant that knows how to properly cook food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
Tressette S.,"Frisco, TX",129,23,68,4.0,9/1/2017,"We have an awesome waiter named Bo.  This place was packed.  Although the wait was 30 minutes, no fuss here since we're hanging out on a Friday with the fam.  About to grub on various delicacies....Let's go.  Our waiter kept the drinks coming without request.  Only gripe was the place was too cold and the salsa wasn't that great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
Rebecca B.,"Washington, DC",35,164,81,2.0,11/27/2017,"Service was awful but I feel like they were extremely understaffed on this particular day. The Deep Eddy's lemonade was delicious, though it took about 20 minutes to get my drink in. I ordered the soup as not much else on the menu is gluten free. My housemate ordered a giant burger which did not come with fries until about 15 minutes after she finished her hamburger. I feel pretty bad as this place was busy and there were only two servers, but I feel as if restaurants should account for these kinds of incidents. I gave an extra star because the manager came by and apologized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
Tandy J.,"McKinney, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/1/2017,This is the worst restaurant ever i waited 20 minutes on hold to order food and they never came back to the phone. So i went in because it's on my way home and it took me standing in the to go line alone six minutes before they said someone will be right with you and took him another 3 before he took my order. As i was ordering he when in the back for at least 2 more minutes so i left and i will never return. They always have poor customer service. I'm not giving them anymore chances.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
Carrie C.,"McKinney, TX",153,91,24,4.0,7/31/2017,"Chili's has good bar specials, so I definitely recommend going during those times and chilling in the bar area.

Matt D.,"McKinney, TX",22,9,,2.0,5/13/2017,"We've had issues before at this location, and they continue to have horrible service and mediocre food. If you're a fan of Chili's, just go to the frisco one. Don't waste your time here. We had to ask for everything at least twice if not three times from our server, and most of our food was cooked poorly or cold.  Drink refills were non-existent unless we harass the server. Luckily it's only this location, the other location in Frisco and other Chili's in the area have always been consistent and good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
Shelly K.,"McKinney, TX",38,4,,2.0,12/4/2017,"It took forever for the front person to even show up to take our name. He was walking so slow that I saw 3 other groups walk out in frustration. On a Monday night, they had ""run out"" of chips. They were then ""having problems with the fried foods"" which resulted in us not getting the fried pickles that we ordered in lieu of the chips and queso. When our burgers arrived, the fries were missing. When they were finally done, they were nice, hot, and crispy.  While our waiter was friendly and apologetic, the rest of the experience was definitely subpar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
Christine H.,"McKinney, TX",1,35,,1.0,8/20/2017,Dear Chilis you are going downhill. Chilis use to be a favorite of ours. Not anymore!! We thought we would give it a try again and ordered take out. What a complete disappointment. My husband ordered chili and it was liquidy and had a film of oil on top. We both ordered salads and asked for extra dressing and grilled chicken. The chicken on my salad wasn't edible it was chewy and tasted very strange. They have us 2 small containers of dressings both half filled. Overall bad meal and wouldn't recommend this Chilis ever!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
Chris W.,"McKinney, TX",2665,646,963,4.0,11/15/2015,"We came in on a busy Saturday evening.  They were on a wait, but the bar area is self seating, so we found a table in there.  We first started with the queso because,  I am addicted.  I need an intervention.  I think they may put crack in to to make you keep coming back.  I can't go in without eating it.  Did I mention I love the queso? I don't know how they do it, but is is literally chili meat with cheese dip.  It comes in a cute cast iron skillet that is convenient for me to lick clean.    Ok, onto the food.  I ordered the soup and salad.  I know boring, but I did just eat the queso so I have to eat a healthy dinner.  The chicken enchilada soup is AWESOME!  I get it without pico, so just be warned it doesn't say it on the menu, but they put pico de gallo on top.  I like the house salad with ranch dressing.  The ranch tastes homemade.   The waitress was friendly. Please note they have a very convenient togo area.  You just pull up to a stand and they come out to your car.  You know for those queso emergencies and you are craving it and you need it right now, but you don't want to go inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
Antony M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",78,118,9,1.0,11/5/2016,"I walked in at approximately 10:40 pm on Saturday night. Frankly, the condition of the restaurant was disgusting. The bar had trash and dishes everywhere as did the dining area.  I asked to speak to the manager, and while apologetic she said she had only just started her shift and seemed rather exasperated.  I haven't been to a Chili's in a long time, but tonight I elected to give them another chance. Tonight this restaurant reminded me why I should continue going elsewhere.  Note to Chili's: I don't want anything for free. I'm merely trying to warn other folks that there's no reason to come here with so many other options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
D A.,"Plano, TX",0,18,12,1.0,6/25/2017,"Food was slow and when it finally got to me, the burger looked like it had been dropped on the floor and haphazardly piled back on the tray. Had almost no taste to it and the vegetables looked old and wilted. The fries were served in a paper sleeve and set in to a metal basket to disguise how few there were. They also had no seasoning and very little flavor.  If they had sent someone to Whataburger and gotten my burger there and brought it back, it would have been faster, better quality, and they would have made three dollars profit on the price difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney
Tori T.,"McKinney, TX",123,1,,1.0,6/23/2017,"The food here has no flavor, and I am highly disappointed. It used to be so nice and I felt more welcome. Now, I am left feeling unsanitary and disgusted. The waitress was very nice, but she did not look clean enough to be waitressing. I feel terrible, because I used to come here all the time. The restaurant feels dirty and the food was bland.

Angie B.,"Farmersville, TX",44,60,19,1.0,9/2/2016,Came here a couple of weeks ago and they had multiple tables open and made us wait for 30 minutes before they could seat us.

Tara M.,"San Francisco, CA",51,2,,1.0,5/12/2017,"We had a table of 5 and our server seemed overwhelmed with this. He got our food orders and when they came and dropped our food off they didnt have a plate. We looked over to where our server was and you could see it in his face that he had forgotten to in put that order. We waited another 20 minutes for that plate to get to our table and by then everyone else had already finished eating. He only came by once to apologoze. Didn't even offer to take the meal off the ticket or offer anything else because it was his fault that he had forgotten to put the order in. He also didn't ask how we wanted the tab split. He just assumed and we spent another 20 mins just waiting on that to happen. We didn't even have complicated orders. We had 2 burgers, Cajun pasta, and chicken fingers. He wasn't sympathetic about any of this. Mind you I used to be a server and if this was me I would've paid for the food that was forgotten and gave them a dessert for free out of my own tips.

There was a wait (it's Friday night) and while we were waiting for our table the waiter came around and asked everyone if they needed a drink. We were across from the bartender and he was so attentive and polite to all his customers. The wait was supposed to be 30 min and we maybe waited 15 before a waiter came and sat us.

Heather D.,"Anna, TX",0,9,7,1.0,3/24/2014,"The last few times we have been here the service has been less than satisfactory all-around. We have been twice in the past month and at least one of our food orders was wrong each time. We asked for extra ranch or cheese when the meal was served, but it was never brought to us. I feel that the wait staff may be waiting too many tables at once. On our most recent dine-in, our waitress was at our table maybe five times the entire night. She seemed to appear when the manager was waiting on us or someone else was bringing out our food and drink refills. It took so long for someone to bring us our food it was cold! When she picked up our plates, after we were done eating, we sat at our table for fifteen minutes waiting for her to come back.

At around 7:30 she finally came back out and asked what she could help me with and I showed her my confirmation. She stated, ""you paid online so I have no record of your order."" It had been sitting on a shelf likely since I had been there and she had never even checked for my name. Further, neither of the items were correct and the steak that comes with asparagus (which is why I select the pricier steak) was missing that and the sauce.

We were seated promptly but then didn't get noticed by our waiter for about 10 min. The service was pretty bad throughout dinner. Ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer and got the standard wattery chilis salsa and cold chips. Two kids ordered kids cheeseburgers and fries which they said was good. Two adults ordered two different burgers and fries which were both tasty as well. I actually substituted a beef patty for a turkey patty which was nice.

This location depresses me. It needs to be remodeled. I kept expecting the 90's cast from Friend's to pop out and sing ""I'll be there for you."" I don't think it has been remodeled since before Ross and Rachel got together. The food hasn't upgraded itself either from the 90's. The chicken fingers are mostly fried breading. The fries are covered in so much salt, you may need to chug a lot of those mugs of water. The staff is young, maybe too young to be waiting on tables, as they seem spacey. I did get a good burger one time. I picked it up, and saved myself from eating inside. That was a good burger! There is a Raising Cane's chicken fingers going in right in front of this location.

Thomas A.,"Dallas, TX",16,29,,1.0,8/15/2011,"If I ever have to go to Chili's, I make sure to lower my standards as much as possible (not that I have high standards to begin with--see my review of Taco Bell). Today's lunch was so much worse than expected that our group was laughing by the end of it. (As a rule, I never complain to a waiter about my experience. If you're stupid enough to eat at Chili's, the joke's on you.) Since the movie Memento came out 9 years ago today (not true), I'm going to write this thing in reverse chronological order. The lunch special I got was $11 before tip. Toss a couple bucks on top and you might as well be at Rick's Chophouse. The food was less good than your average Chili's food, which is really saying something. The food took fivever (like forever but even longer) to show up. We were in and out in just under an hour and a half. This is the worst part: there's a beeping noise that plays a high E at 200 dB in three-second intervals. It went on so long I was able to investigate and find the source of the problem. They started a Sonic-style drive-up at this place. When someone gets to the special parking spots he presses a button to signal the person inside that he wants to place an order from his car. That button-press sets off the aforementioned beeping, and it doesn't stop until someone answers it. The problem is that no one ever answers the beeping, and everyone is looking around like ""hey, where's the dang button guy?"" We're talking 10 minutes straight of beeping noises; it was like watching George Carlin edited for television. Maybe it was the button guy's day off.

Rachel I.,"Burlington, WI",7,45,1,2.0,2/6/2012,"I hate coming to this location. We have been here a handful of times (since July till now) and if it wasn't for it being dinner time (= traffic), we would go to the Allen location. All but the last time, the place was dirty and the servers sucked. Each time I told my husband I didn't want to come back and so we finally tried Applebees which is next door to Chili's. MUCH better experience there. We only went back to Chili's this last time because I was given a gift card. The last experience was actually pretty good. The server, Erica, was great and the manager walking around (a blonde older woman, cannot remember her name) was very nice. We got the Chicken Crispers original and the chicken was very spongy and gross. The manager brought us the crispy Crispers and they were much better. Erica offered to take one of our meals off the bill, but we were not telling her they sucked for that reason. I had eaten almost all of it until I couldn't take another bite for fear of throwing it back up due to how gross it was. I only told her my complaint as I thought it might be the brand of chicken (I've had spongy chicken with certain brands)... Apparently it's just how it's cooked when it's the Original. My husband only ate one or two of the Original ones but did eat up the Crispy ones.   In the end, despite another ""bad"" experience at this location, Erica and the manager saved it. We normally do not get that meal at Chili's, so I'm not going to hold it against them. Since we had a much better experience w/ the staff that day, perhaps we'll be back instead of going to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mckinney?start=40
