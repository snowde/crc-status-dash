Paula P.,"Melbourne, FL",121,41,85,3.0,11/9/2017,"I mean this place wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. I went on my lunch break because a co-worker and I wanted a change of pace.  We were seated very fast and I thought that it was strange that it was not busy at 12:15pm for lunch.  We kinda knew right away what we wanted.  Our server was named John and I swear he didn't crack a smile or seem to care the entire time.  That is a put off to me when you are a server. Our salad came out very fast and it was good. Nice lunch size. Before we ended up getting our quesadilla lunches he walked by and kicked the server station cabinet door.  Now that wasn't very professional at all. Finally we got the food and it was good.  I have no problems there and we were asked about our check in a timely manner.  When I went to use the little kiosk on the table it errored out for me but said everything was done. A complaint about that is that it was very dirty and sticky.  My co-worker also asked for a soda to go and he actually rolled his eyes.  Seriously? You asked if there was anything else that you could help us with and when we give you something you roll your eyes.  NOT PROFESSIONAL!   From years ago it does seem as if this place has gone a little down hill...not very clean and very sticky.  I mean I am not going to stop coming here is someone offers to go out but I will not go out of my way to actually come over here.  If you just clean more and get your people to smile more, the reviews might be even better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Sean B.,"Melbourne, FL",3,27,31,3.0,8/14/2017,"Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Chilis.  I rope it into the Applebee's style of dinning and my life would not be affected anyway if Chilis were to ever go out of business.  With that said, we have a lot of our office lunches here as their menu is very diverse.  All the different walks of life in our office can easily find something on the menu they would enjoy.  I normally get the shrimp tacos, and they are always fairly decent.  I recently tried the cauliflower buffalo bites and it was a very healthy alternative.  If you're looking to entertain a large crowd and everyone likes to eat something different, Chilis is perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Jeff S.,"Melbourne, FL",27,8,5,2.0,10/26/2017,Only my opinion but they have a lot of work to do. Their greeter lacked people skills. Our server was tentative to our 2 top party with sweet tea. I had been seeing their new and improved menu on tv and radio about their ribs. Highly disappointed with lacking flavor and dryness even though I got the sweet chipotle sauce. When I asked for extra sauce they brought out a super cold side which killed the warmth of the ribs. Hold off on paying an extra dollar for onion rings because they were blah and no dipping sauce. The corn on the cob was fantastic so get that on the side. I don't think I'll be spending $40 on any of their meals anymore! I also hope our server finds another restaurant because she won't make much there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Fran D.,"Melbourne, FL",1,2,,5.0,8/26/2017,"Always great food and great service.  Whether we're only going in for drinks and appetizers or a couple of meals,  the waitstaff at Chili's is always great.  We always leave feeling that we got our money's worth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Weare T.,"Satellite Beach, FL",1,3,2,1.0,10/23/2016,"Up until today, my family of 4 have been patrons of this restaurant for many years.  I have noticed over the past few months that the wait staff is becoming less and less friendly as though they would rather be elsewhere. I have also noticed the restaurant getting dirty and today experienced pure disgust in the men's bathroom. Disgusting toilets and urine on the floor in each stall, obviously not having been cleaned all day long.   Years back the restaurant stopped serving free chips and salsa in all general areas other than the bar lounge area.  Now they don't serve it there either.   We spend a minimum of $60 every time we come out for dinner.  $3 for a basket of twice fried chips with a tiny cup of salsa? Really? Applebee's here we come.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Becky B.,"Melbourne, FL",35,118,140,3.0,8/17/2016,Our first time to Chillis in a really long time. It was so so. The Loaded Boneless Wings were amazing..the rest of the food..not so much..I would not recommend getting the Fajitas ..my son got the bone in wings..in BBQ sauce they were ok..we finished our meal with cheesecake with strawberry sauce..ehh..it was also ok..we ate it. Definitely not worth our bill of $50..but we left full..but probably won't be back anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Nikia C.,"Melbourne, FL",220,7,,5.0,5/2/2017,"This is my favorite chili's. Haven't had a bad experience yet. Last night, my girl friend and I went for dinner & drinks and we had an awesome server. Nate was very attentive and just a joy in general. He definitely made an impact on the quality overall. Nate is great! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Albert M.,"Melbourne, FL",0,4,,4.0,1/7/2017,"Love Chili's. The servers here are always great, personable and attentive. They also seem overworked. We usually spend 15 minutes trying to decide where to go for dinner yet we often end up here",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Aynot R.,"Titusville, FL",0,5,2,1.0,6/14/2016,"Worst food I've had in a long time. We were there for a late lunch... First mistake. I ordered potato soup and they were out ( at 2 pm?!) so i got chicken enchilada instead. It was decent. Then I ordered lunch fajitas. What i got was bagged chicken product (tyson's?)  dumped on onions in a sizzling skillet. I took one bite, that was enough. It was disgusting and didnt remotely taste like chicken. I never took another bite. To add insult to injury, to waitress never returned to our table to ask how it was so i couldn't even send it back. We finally paid our bill via the table top kiosk because it was apparent she wasnt returning to bring is us a bill... Or a refill. Just stay away from this place. Dont waste your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Mario A.,"Melbourne, FL",0,6,9,2.0,7/29/2016,"Place has gone down hill. I ordered salmon, shrimp, broccoli and mash potatoes. Salmon was super over cooked and dry, shrimp was soo salty i might as well drank out the salt shaker. Didnt touch my broccoli because it smelled bad and the end stems where black. Potatoes where not too bad. My wife ordered the chicken soup and it was bag tyson chicken...nasty. Waitress was nice though. Yah, we will not got back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Jamie S.,"Orlando, FL",8,7,4,4.0,9/13/2015,We had dinner there 2 for $20. It was good our sever was wonderful she was on top of making sure we were taken care of. We didn't have to ask her for anything.needless to say she got a good tip. We will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Jeremy V.,"Patrick Air Force Base, FL",0,10,,3.0,1/28/2016,"Chili's is a good restaurant chain, it is family friendly and good on the wallet. I like the all you can eat soup and salad at lunch.  The Chicken crispers are still a family favorite.  The only critique I would have is the silverware and the dishes could be a bit cleaner coming out.  We usually have to send at least one out of the four silverware back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Kevin M.,"Palm Bay, FL",88,50,4,5.0,10/28/2015,"I love this restaurant. I have probably been here over 100 times since moving to Palm Bay in 2011- the best wait staff, no wait times, food is on point every single time- atmosphere is always great and the restaurant is always clean. Can't complain",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Joseph G.,"Melbourne, FL",38,21,9,1.0,9/16/2015,Sorry not a fan of Melbourne Chili's. The wait staff was incompetent and very slow. The food was not worth the wait it was mediocre at best. I felt a little sick after having baby back ribs. This was not the first time going there. And it was not better then either. The table next to us was filthy and had dishes of food from customers before us and it was not  cleared until we were getting ready to leave which was about three and a half hours later. If they cant keep the dinning area clean I hate to see what the kitchen must looked like.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Virginia B.,"Manassas, VA",9,161,8,4.0,9/22/2012,"I'm not a huge chain restaurant fan, but when I travel I tend to seek out the reliable chains and Chili's is one that I seek out wherever I go. I was there around 3:30p to have a quick meal before my flight out of the Melbourne airport.  I sat in the bar and was immediately taken care of by my server, Kathy.  She brought my food out quickly and took care of my check ahead of time so I could run out as soon as I was done. Everything about my quick meal was great and I would definitely go back again on my way to the airport next time I am in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Zaira G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",102,2,72,3.0,11/26/2014,Chili's is perfect for grabbing a beer after a long day at work. Food is great and everyone's super nice. Ask for Mark Wheeler! :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Hilda D.,"Belgrade, MT",1,4,,4.0,8/2/2015,"I'm not a huge chain restaurant fan but I did try Chili's for the first time today and just wanted to say that the Prime Rib tacos were amazing even though they missed the queso fresco. I didn't say anything to the waitress but then again I'm scared of returning my food after watching ""Waiting"". The server could have been a bit more upbeat and asked us for refills on drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
Justin W.,"Melbourne, FL",0,4,,4.0,9/6/2016,"I've only been to this location for To-Go, maybe every other month for the last two years. The food is always good, but they get very disorganized when they are even a little busy. If ordering to go, I highly suggest checking your order before you leave, as they tend to get things wrong often (adding toppings you specifically asked be removed, using the wrong kind of cheese on burgers, etc.)  Once, I showed up at the scheduled time and the girl said it would be a few more minutes. There were 2 large bags sitting in the counter when I arrived. After 10 minutes, she went back to the kitchen, scooped some chips in a to go bag, put them in one of the large bags on the counter and called me up to say my order was ready. I believe they pay a bit more attention to in store diners, but I really cannot speak to that. Still, If you just want to grab something delicious and reasonably cheap on the way from home, I recommend it. Just check to be sure you get what you wanted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne

Carolyn F.,"Savannah, GA",0,2,,1.0,11/3/2014,"I had dinner at Chili's with my daughter tonight. We waited for 30 minutes for our order.  Fajitas and a burger. The only time the waiter checked on us was when he asked if we were ok was while he was wiping off an adjacent table. The food was ok .  It was looking like we were going to have another long wait to pay our bill,the bartender took our bill for us. It wasn't even that busy. I used to be a fan of Chili's but not any more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne
HR Tech Partner ..,"Las Vegas, NV",16,58,80,5.0,6/23/2013,I have to admit sometime my service and food as not been up to Par BUT !!! when this happens I get the managers involved and they will take care of you. I can tell you I go there on a regular basis and yes they are not perfect but the managers care and that is whet makes the difference and if the GM is not there and you walk out not happy call General Manager and let him know. Make sure you talk to the GM not the manager on duty. He really cares and wants to make sure you are happy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne?start=20
Chuck F.,"Melbourne, FL",156,115,314,5.0,11/3/2012,"The best, most consistent food and service in the industry. Great prices, always friendly service.

Abi D.,"Melbourne, FL",4,29,15,3.0,9/2/2014,"Chili's is a common chain restaurant in America. I expected decent quality and that's what I got. Upon arriving, we were seated and then served chips and salsa, endlessly. Our waitress was nice but she seemed distracted by other tables the entire time, not focused on the task at hand. The new addition, table side guacamole, where you get to create your own personalized guacamole, was a unique add on and made up for the lacking service. My food however, was complimented by the jazzy music and sports on television around me. The sweet potato fries were very good, but probably oilier than that of McDonalds. I don't know if it was me but they were just addictive. The broccoli side and the black beans side were mediocre, nothing special. A plus to Chili's that I don't often see is that they offer to convert any dish into a meatless one, which is nice. The meatless mushroom and Swiss burger was one of the biggest burgers I've ever eaten so you will get the bang for your buck. Overall I had a nice experience but it wasn't particularly memorable.  This Chili's is a place to go if you're looking for a fast but quality dinner and are low on cash but don't care about carbs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne?start=20
Diane C.,"Viera, FL",1,28,,3.0,4/22/2012,"Typical Chili's chain restaurant.  However when I walked in on a Saturday night at 6:00, there was no wait and I found a seat right at the end of the bar.  They had 2 for 1 drafts which the bartender pointed out to me when I ordered a bottle beer.  So I went along with draft beer, I ordered a new sampler blackened chicken sliders, cheese steak sliders and southwest egg rolls.  $10.99 for the meal.  It was very filling and quite good.  I will make every effort to return to this restaurant.  I was also told that they have happy hours 1/2 price appetizers during the week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne?start=20
Alice E.,"Melbourne, FL",0,19,,1.0,3/1/2014,I used to love this place.  Things have gone way down!!  The French fries tasted baked and had strange flavor. The burger was greasy and not seasoned well.  Service was the only good thing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne?start=20
Sarah H.,"Indialantic, FL",29,97,1,1.0,11/6/2008,"I've been a server, hell I practically ran the shit hole Italian place I worked at a few yrs back. So I understand the nightmare of running 8 tables while answering phones for delivery/take out, writing up all the tickets and ringing out dine in and take outs. I feel your pain. I also tip no less than 40%. Unless I'm seated in an area where every unoccupied table (8 out of 11) is DESTROYED. So gross. Disturbing the manager walked thru the section 7 times and never once blinked. It stayed that way thru out the entire meal.  Took almost 20 min from when we sat to when the girl took our order. Fine on a busy night - it wasn't. She had 1 table already eating, one who already ordered and us. Really? When we can see you standing around talking to your co-workers? Not cool. I had nothing to drink the entire meal.....yeah - I kinda finished the ice tea I had gotten 45 min before. Go figure. She stopped by the table when we both had our mouths full and said ""Oh everthing's ok. Cool"" and walked away as I reached for my empty glass. Finally flagged down some other server who got us refills.  That's fine. You want to give shitty service cuz you know the food's that good? It's not. It's Chili's and it's not all that good. I wasn't expecting 5 star food & service. Just some basic decent food and average service. When you find yourself in an establishment who can't muster either, you know what you do? Never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne?start=20
Wesley S.,"Manhattan, NY",263,395,43,2.0,1/6/2012,"I am not such a  big on the chain restaurants such as this one, however usually they get a one up for their exceptional service, coupons and large menus. Well this one has the large menu and the Chili's Corporate Deals, but the service was very poor. I have been here enough to comment now and 2 out of 3 times I have gone here the service has been a two on a ten point scale. Having once been a server myself, I also take a lot of variables into account, but when you have someone who introduces themselves as your server's helper, the staff  really need to get it together and work as a team to make sure your customers have what they are needing in a timely manner. That being said the food is typical Chili's, which usually is not bad. It is too bad the service does not match what I have grown to know as typical Chili's Service. It would quicker at this location to order your food with their Smartphone App and get a table to eat it. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne?start=20
April B.,"Casselberry, FL",0,4,,1.0,2/20/2014,"My bf and I are chili regulars in oviedo and always have a pleasant experience. Therefore we decided to try the chilis in veira since we're here for a cpl weeks. Not the same at all! My bf was drinking bl draft which are 2 4 1, he paid for two and was only served 3. The bar was not busy so maybe if the bartender was less concerned about shift change and more concerned about her job she wouldn't of missed something so simple. We also ordered 2 shots of rock lobsters. Before she had poured them I asked her to change them to royal flushes. She then brings me 1 of each..? And to top it off she charged me 9.55 per shot. Lol 9.55 for a half shot of crown a dash of peach shnp and cranberry juice. What? Its not like we ordered crown on the rocks or even staight up. We will never go bk to this chili's and my advice to those of you who go, look over ur check before getting over charged and ripped off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne?start=20
Marsha S.,"Melbourne, FL",2,27,4,2.0,8/23/2011,"I've avoided Chilis for several years now as the quality of their food has gone down and they removed the spinach and artichoke quesadillas that were perfect for vegetarians.  I was excited to see they now have a vegetarian options menu.  So I went with a couple of friends and ordered the lunch break with the house salad and cobb salad with black beans.  For $7 I got about a third of a head of iceberg lettuce (which no restaurant should still be using), avocado dressing (not bad) and not quite 2 tablespoons of black beans.  Yeah, I won't be going back again.  And I'll be steering all my friends away from your restaurant.  Iceberg lettuce?  Really?  Don't they realize it has no nutritional value? There was almost nothing else in the cobb salad -- a couple of tiny pieces of avocado and red peppers.  And black beans are CHEAP.  Why would they be so stingy with them. Very, very disappointing. On the plus side, our waitress was okay, even though she got 2 of the bills wrong and didn't show up for a while after we got our meals.  She did manage to get our somewhat unusual meal orders correct.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-melbourne?start=20
