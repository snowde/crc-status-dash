Mindy V.,"San Marcos, TX",7,2,6,4.0,7/11/2015,"Went in on a Saturday at 11:30 with my mom & sister. We had the place to ourselves aside from 2-3 other small parties. Received our food right away & placed a to go order for our father which we revived just as we were finishing our lunches which was nice.  Strawberry lemonade was a little warm, you could tell ice had just been added but not too big a deal. Ordered the guac & chips as part of the 2 for $20. Guac is good, comes with salsa as well. Chips were crispy but for a few which were fairly oily & salty. Entree was the honey Chipotle chicken crisper with corn on the cob & fries. Crispers had the honey Chipotle sauce poured over them on the plate. Fries were seasoned nicely & corn was good also.  Quick service, nice waitress , nice atmosphere, clean bathroom, food was good & served quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Sheryl B.,"Laguna Vista, TX",0,2,,1.0,7/23/2017,Waitstaff was very slow to respond in fact we was totally ignored. One of our dinners was cold. We will not be going back to this Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Lauren H.,"San Antonio, TX",10,17,,1.0,8/12/2016,"Not a good experience from the moment we walked in.  God forbid the hostess do her job and actually seat us, instead we sat ourselves bc she clearly couldn't be bothered to do what she gets paid to do. She preferred to return to the table that other coworkers were sitting at.   The music in the restaurant was deafening. We asked for it to be turned down bc we could barely hear each other talk. There wasn't anyone in the restaurant so for the music to be that loud was uncalled for. The manager BARELY turned it down and then turned it back up when the next song started. We left there with our ears ringing as if we had just been to a rock concert.  My fiancé ordered a regular bacon burger and asked for avocado slices. Big surprise when he got his order and there weren't any avocado slices. The waiter/ bartender acted like it was our fault bc we didn't tell him as soon as we got our order. Kind of hard to do when you don't check on your tables like you should. Not to mention all the nats flying around all the tables. So gross!  Thankfully we don't live here and are just visiting family, but one thing is for sure. We won't EVER come back to this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Trisha S.,"Mission, TX",30,50,12,1.0,3/2/2016,"This place is the worst restaurant that I have been in so far. The service was extremely shoddy, taking at least 20 minutes before we were even acknowledged at the table. Food was so salty we could hardly eat it. We spoke with the manager about the slow service and he was very belligerent. Trust me this is the last time I will ever go to this chilies",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
David L.,"Mission, TX",59,8,10,1.0,9/6/2015,"Who hasn't been to dine at a Chili's restaurant?  You can't avoid one!!  And sometimes they are pretty darn comfortable and food isn't bad...... Unless you and your family would prefer to get ignored and belittled and patronized at the Chili's in Weslaco. Just save yourself the bad karmic vibes and avoid coming here to endure a great heaping of neglect.  You could wait for close to an hour for a table on a late Sunday night as the restaurant tables sit empty and lied to repeatedly by the manager as to why your family cannot occupy those empty seats.  Customer service is just not a priority here.  You could watch those empty tables as they sit barren while others eat heartily only to be told your family cannot sit there ""for your best comfortable experience""......whatever the hell that means.?   We left after waiting patiently in the hopes that the manager (lady) would have some sensibilities kick in and realize that making a group of tired travel weary hungry family members did not need to have their late night meal ruined because she didn't want to open up a couple tables........God forbid they actually have to work before closing time.  I truly cannot believe that a human being would lie so blatantly to justify a lack of professional customer service which is exactly the line of work they are supposed to do. Chili's food is pretty good, and I will probably visit one closer to our home at some point, but never returning here to Weslaco ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Dawn L.,"Cypress, TX",26,43,5,1.0,4/8/2015,Apparently all of the wait staff call in (see the previous review from August 2013!). Worst service and I'm sitting at the bar.  No one was in the bar waiting on customers. Sat here for over 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged me and they had customers in the bar already. Food is taking forever too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Marlene P.,"Weslaco, TX",0,3,,1.0,2/21/2015,So I went with my husband to celebrate some good news and let me just say the staff turned our good mood into a horrible one. First we called ahead and our table wasn't ready. Next waiter comes up to us with a whatever kind of attitude no kindness whatsoever. Appetizers are brought out to us with no plates and when I asked another waiter for plates he rolled his head as if it was an inconvenience to him. Refills were mixed so my husband had his water full of my strawberry lemonade drinks next waiters were discussing who should care for our table right in front of us so rude. When we asked for a refill of our salsa and chips all she brought was salsa and no chips. Really? Then the chips she brought later were so stale you could literally bend them as they were tacos. When I finally had enough I spoke with the manager and she told me sorry and comp half of our bill. As we  were waiting for our bill the waiter brought it and rudely slammed the pen down and turned and walked away. Bad service. Ok food. Ok accommodations. Really expected more from this franchise. As I said we were celebrating good news but left with a horrible time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Greg T.,"San Antonio, TX",1,10,16,1.0,8/22/2013,"Apparently, several staff members called in and they were short handed.  The food was typical Chili's.  We were seated quickly but it took over 20 minutes for the waiter to make his appearance. It about 30 more minutes to get our food and about 20 minutes to get our check .... Bad day at Chili's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
AnnMar C.,"Weslaco, TX",0,8,2,1.0,10/12/2014,"The food is okay, once you get it.  It took approximately 1 hour to get it after we placed our order.  Drink refills were very slow and so was checkout.  We were also charged for using the electronic devices that were on the table without letting us know there was a charge for using them during the one hour wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Muhaya E.,"Harlingen, TX",1,5,5,1.0,1/26/2014,Well we placed our full order took us half hour to get our drinks without straws another 15 min to get one of the appetizers  and soup and everyone's order would come separately our waitress was an idiot would disappear from the floor completely 20 min at a time  good luck getting refills an hour an a half in I'm the last to get my plate my husband returns his fajita trio mind U she didn't bring the beans or tortillas w it  our second appetizers didn't come w any dipping sauce for the wings  soup was lukewarm and the best part when we decided she isnt getting a tip for her ugly service she actually added tip into receipt for a party of four. The manager is trying to tell us that the computer does that automatically yeah right we paid in full and got out of there this was chilis by the outlets what disgraceful service for a franchise like that,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Eric H.,"San Benito, TX",0,16,,4.0,4/13/2014,One of the best bartenders we've seen in the rgv. Plus added the touch screen to each tables and you can go wrong,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Happy T.,"Round Rock, TX",33,125,9,1.0,9/2/2010,"This is your typical Chili's and there is no reason to comment on the food.  I've eaten here many times for lunch and everything would warrant a good comment for their lunch service. The last couple of visits have been during Dinner.  Their dinner service has been atrocious.  I've had to wait almost 10 mins each time to be serve, every time I arrive they try to stick me by the kitchen and then when I do order they take another 10 mins to get the drink.  Place seriously needs help in the evening.  Go to The Blue Onion on FM 1015 foods better and so is the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Jose S.,"McAllen, TX",93,235,129,3.0,12/17/2010,"This has been my preferred Chili's lately.  The service, and food have always been spot on.  Watch out on the weekends though, as it gets really packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
Eric E.,"Ferris, TX",20,101,36,5.0,8/13/2009,"Outstanding service! I have been to several outlets of this chain, and this is by far the best I have ever experienced! The servers are attentive and fast. The food is up fast and perfect every time. I enjoy dropping in while on business to the RGV.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mercedes-2
