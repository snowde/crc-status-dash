Tom S.,"Spring, TX",0,4,1,3.0,6/10/2016,"By American standards the food and service stinks...I ordered the Guacamole Burger and it was hard to eat. I was hungry and almost didn't finish it.   I ate at the bar.  Waited almost 15 minutes before anyone handed me a  menu and equally long to get the food and the bill. Just simply not very attentive but hey, that might be the way they do things here in Merida.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-merida
