Les W.,"Meridian, MS",19,38,17,4.0,9/6/2017,Hostess did not smile at all but did not growl. Waitress compensated for the former employee by giving the greatest smile and welcome I have seen to date. Food order was painless. Ordered the Oldtimer with cheese. I was asked several  times for refills. Burger was very good and being a first timer to this resturant. Now to the bathroom. I would give bathrooms each a 'B'. I am trusting my wife for ladies.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Larry C.,"Demopolis, AL",39,33,50,4.0,5/21/2017,This visit started out slow but got better as time went by. They have one server call in so we went in knowing that they were short on servers. We were lucky and got Amber as our server she is fantastic. She helped us with our menu selections made sure that we all had our drinks and helped each of us get every little thing that we needed. I really enjoyed the baked potato soup it was very good. For an appetizer we got the guacamole chips and salsa with your always fantastic. My daughter Rachel had a steak and it was cooked to Perfection she really liked the broccoli and side salad but when she saw the grilled asparagus on another table she wished she had gotten that instead of the broccoli. Suzette had the grilled chicken and it was very good and healthy we will be back and we will ask for Amber our next trip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Khondker I.,"Meridian, MS",496,100,457,2.0,1/21/2017,"Price is average. Big lists of food in the menu. Did not like chicken tortilla soup, really disappointed about the taste . Southwestern egg rolls are good with honey mustard sauce. Noisy place. Service is slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Jared G.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",169,11,1,5.0,6/25/2017,"Seriously amazing service. The manager offered us a free dessert and my fries came out late and the waitress offered to give me new fries if they didn't taste good. Our glasses were always full and very friendly people work here. ""I feel God in this Chili's tonight."" - Pam from The Office",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Eric B.,"San Antonio, TX",31,304,197,1.0,9/10/2015,"Along with all the rest of the review, I wish I would have read them before going.  We decided to eat at chili's because there were fewer cars in the parking lot compared to Olive Garden and we didn't have much time to eat lunch... now we know why there were fewer cars. :( I ordered a sandwich and my buddy order the salad... it took almost 45 minutes for our food to arrive and the salad was not fresh at all.   Management definitely needs to look at changing how they do business..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Winston F.,"Galveston, TX",0,20,3,1.0,5/20/2016,"Pass on it. I wanted a burger, and had the following: a greeter who seemed annoyed I was there, slow service, and ok food. Added avocado, and got two small lumps(the manager did fix this) It wasn't worth it for me. They need some serious training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Coral E.,"Ridgeland, MS",111,330,12,4.0,1/21/2016,"Despite the reviews, we had a good experience at this Chili's location today. The one in Jackson,MS is terrible - so I was hoping this location would be better and it was. We had friendly service, good food and the restaurant was clean. Our entree was a tad slow, but nothing worth complaining about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Kathryn E.,"Meridian, MS",0,8,,1.0,9/7/2015,"Wow. We wish we would have read the reviews before going in!  The food took over an hour to get. The salad was hastily put together and absolutely drenched in dressing. The fish tacos were suspiciously cold and extremely soggy. We don't understand how it took an hour for this food to get made. The food and service need a lot of help. Will not be going back. Negative experience.  Management (if there is any) needs to retrain their staff on hospitality and promptness. Our waitress was as easy to find as a shooting star, And would fly by equally fast.   Unfortunately, can't put down less than 1 star. 1 star is too much of a compliment to this experience. It's almost worth it to go here just to see the awful experience. Just don't come hungry. At all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Tim R.,"Kapolei, HI",12,48,27,1.0,9/11/2016,"Salt salt and then more Salt.  Our waitress was wonderful. The food was not.  I ordered a prime rib taco that was made I believe out of pot roast.  My son had the buffalo chicken sandwich which he stated was just ""ok"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Gary H.,"Meridian, MS",0,3,,1.0,5/10/2016,"Absolute ass. The whole experience. Unless you want to piss off your entire family in one fell swoop, go eat at a convenience store. You'll be better off. Ass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Calvin B.,"Butler, AL",0,3,,1.0,10/8/2016,"Horrible. Arrived and was seated in 5 minutes. Not very busy by the looks so I was expecting good service. Waitress was very slow getting to us. She seemed to not care how slow she went. Finally received our drinks and placed our order. Very simple a burger with fries and a 6 oz steak med rare. 35 minutes later and nothing. Waitress never stopped to ask if we needed anything, complete slob. I had enough after waiting 45 minutes asked for a manager and the best they can say is ""its almost out"", no apology. I say forget it I am leaving. Never ever go here. Only thing that was apparent was the level of incompetence.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
David P.,"Meridian, MS",33,1,,5.0,10/1/2016,"Just had dinner, great new loaded fajitas. Jennifer the server was awesome. Also try the fried pickles they were awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Taylor E.,"Houston, TX",0,6,1,2.0,1/16/2016,"We went in about 40 minutes untill closing time, just wanting to get a drink while waiting for a to-go order. The bartender was leaving right as we walked in and noted that another employee would be making the drinks. Fine by us, untill we realized she may not have even been qualified to do so... just an assumption based off of us asking for a fireball shot and she asked what was in it. *For the non-drinkers fire ball is brand of straight whiskey, not a mixed shot. For our dinner we ordered something we always order at home, the classic nachos, they came out not so great. Looked nothing like they are supposed to, tasted sub-par and just thrown in the box. I assume everyone was ready to go home but they could have been prepared better and we still would have been out before closing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Jenna Gardiner G.,"Barnesville, GA",0,3,,1.0,7/17/2016,"When calling in an To Go order and being told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes and getting there and having to wait another 20 minutes is not very good for business. Customer service was also very poor, would not suggest this Restaurant to anyone , with all the Traveling I do and Restaurants I attend , this is by far the worse  one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Susan L.,"Meridian, MS",16,36,13,1.0,10/25/2015,"The only reason we came back here again was because someone had given us a gift card. Service still slow and horrible, seemed like it was the kitchen staff having issues. Our waitress was trying her best and mentioned that she had to "" fight and beg"" to get our food. We had fried pickles for an appetizer, the pickles were floppy, mushy, and downright gross. We also had the Chipotle chicken tenders with corn and fries. The chicken was hard and tasted old, fries and corn were cold. The constant arguing and cussing coming from the kitchen was loud and annoying (I have small kids).  Will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Emily S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,7,,3.0,3/21/2016,"We ordered two meals to-go, and when we came in at pickup time, there was a line of other waiting customers. A manager offered us something to drink while we waited, and was extremely friendly, but our food took another 20 minutes (50 total from the time ordered) and was cold (with soggy fries) when get got it back to the hotel to eat. Sub-par for this reputable chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Dakota R.,"Los Angeles, CA",152,3,,2.0,10/7/2015,Two stars for my waitress who was really sweet. My order was wrong twice and I heard them yelling in the kitchen...time for some new management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
David H.,"Meridian, MS",10,13,16,1.0,2/16/2014,Horrible horrible service. Extremely slow. Took forever to get our food and then our ticket.  We had to go ask for someone to cash out the ticket.  Server was unfriendly and never smiled. Not helpful. Crappy attitude. Dropped a knife on the floor and just kicked it to the side. Never picked it up. The knife was still laying there 30 minutes later when we left.  Corporate management needs to step in and take this place over.  Don't go here. You will regret it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Hamish B.,"Collinsville, MS",0,10,1,3.0,3/30/2016,"I ordered a sweet tea without lemon & a glass of water. Both came quickly. I wanted to order the artichoke dip as an appetizer & was told Chili's no longer carries it. My waiter recommended a spinach & cheese dip as a substitute. It was OK. I then ordered a hamburger w/o lettuce & w/fries to split with my wife. It was split in the kitchen as requested. The fries were mostly room temperature or less. I didn't really care because we rarely eat such fried starches. However, it was bad enough that my wife commented that the fries tasted like they had sat around for awhile. There was lettuce on the sandwich. I just took it off. The staff should pay better attention to customer requests. What if I were allergic to lettuce, taking it off would not have worked? Service was not the best. We were greeted by a manager, I believe, & seated by the same. Nice enough. Our waiter did put forth some effort but, could use some training. I left a good tip because I could tell he wanted to do well & still not hover. I will not be going back for awhile. There was nothing really wrong, I'm just ambivalent about the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Sean T.,"Enterprise, MS",0,28,3,1.0,3/7/2015,"It's almost worth going just to witness the legendary bad service. Bring your own food, drinks and seat yourself, because the staff seems to struggle with all three things I just mentioned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4
Brian W.,"Meridian, MS",0,7,,1.0,9/25/2015,"Absolute worst food I've ever eaten. I don't know if it was just than one night, but my wife and I vowed to never go back, it was that horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4?start=20
C -.,"Glendale, AZ",1,22,,1.0,1/16/2015,Horrible service!!!!!  Chili's corporate needs to change something here.  From the moment we walked in to the time we left without even ordering it was bad.  Hostess seemed to have a chip on her shoulder and was extremely unfriendly to the fact that no one ever came to our table after we were seated.  We left and will never return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4?start=20
Justice P.,"San Antonio, TX",1,2,9,1.0,4/23/2013,"Do Not Go Here To Eat! We were greeted five minutes after we arrived, our server was slow in getting our orders, our server was also switched halfway through the meal, the food was salty, salad gritty, and they didn't bring out part of our order. It's really sad when a franchise ruins the name of a great restaurant. And this one almost made me never want to go to Chili's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4?start=20
Vickie C.,"Jackson, TN",0,1,,1.0,8/10/2015,Wish we had read reviews before stopping here.  Service was slow - 1 hour to get terrible food. Then they cooked the wrong pizza for our child. The Tex-Mex enchiladas were not edible. The only barely decent entree was the flatbread pizza. Don't waste your time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4?start=20
George M.,"Meridian, MS",0,3,,1.0,6/15/2015,Well went back today heard it was better.. Walk in and waitress walk right past us as if we are not there.. Finally ask one do we seat ourselfs or what? And she said where do you want to set?so we set in the bar area and wait and wait and wait and finally push the waitress button and she said my i help yall.. Lol.. So she takes our order and 10 mins later another waitress said why did you push the button? I told her that was 30 mins ago. She got really pissed and said no it has not been that long. ( seemed longer) any way the lady finaally takes the food orders and stuff. ( almost walked out). Please someone hire a manager to run that resturant before you have to close it..my god it can be a really good place to eat..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4?start=20
Robert H.,"Inman Park, Atlanta, GA",0,11,,1.0,11/27/2012,Place was dirty. Food was sub par. Tasted like chemicals and preservatives. Server was nice but very slow. Won't be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4?start=20
Jesse M.,"Marietta, GA",1,101,9,1.0,6/16/2012,"Worst ever!!  Stopped on our way down I-20 for lunch. The place is sooooo dirty, don't even want to mention the nasty restrooms with no TP or soap. The food was even worse. The buffalo chicken sandwich was dried up shriveled piece of leather. The sauce was on it but totally dried. Everything looked and tasted dry and prepared hours before. Save yourself and pic somewhere else to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4?start=20
J C.,"Meridian, MS",1,2,,1.0,4/30/2013,I do like the food here but it is impossible to enjoy it. The last two visits the orders have been wrong and taken an hour or more to receive.  The last visit took 30 minutes to receive chips and salsa and an order of wings. It was over an hour for the food to get there and then it was cold.   The waitress we have had both times is clueless.  Maybe it is just her.  I just do not see myself going back.  Besides the delay the place  was dirty.  Just an overall bad experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-4?start=20
