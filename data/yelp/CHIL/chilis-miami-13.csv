Karina T.,"Miami, FL",20,6,2,3.0,11/27/2017,"Love chili's!!! Food is great, service is great, wait time is not too bad, however my favorite drink of all time is the frozen mango margarita and the machine that makes the frozen margaritas is broken!  I visit this location quite often with friends and family since it's close to home and the machine had been broken for months!!! The bartenders have even recommended that I contact corporate since they also feel it's been a long time since the machine has supposedly ""shipped"". It's so sad and it's the only reason why I didn't rate this restaurant 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13
Rachel P.,"Miami, FL",14,88,186,2.0,11/14/2017,"I have been to Chili's plenty of times.  This experience though has been the worst one I've ever had at a Chili's.  We had to ask who our server was after waiting to be greeted for 15 mins (after already being seated). They took our order, and we waited another 20 mins for our food.  By the time our food did get there, it was our main course with the appetizer.  I mentioned the appetizer, they took the main course back and finally brought out the app 10 minutes later.  You could tell it was just sitting there - not sure if someone forgot to bring it out or what but we ordered the white queso dip and the guac on top was brown, the pico de gallo was dried out and the cheese itself was almost hard rather than saucy from being under the warmer for so long.  The then brought out our meals.  You can tell this was all also sitting under the warmer while we finished the app.  My pasta was dry despite asking for extra sauce and they didnt garnish the pasta with any cheese like other locations do.  My father's burger was soggy and the pickles inside the burger were hot and soggy instead of crisp -- again, this is from sitting under the warmer. I asked for a coke, but they completely forgot.  I would usually go for dessert, but I just wanted to leave this place so I didn't order any.   I've been here other times and it was never this bad, but this experience has made me not want to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13
Damian R.,"Miami, FL",22,53,1,1.0,7/16/2017,"This is the worst restaurant i have ever been to. My wife wanted to come here because for some unknown reason she seems to enjoy these chain restaurants which are all awful. Any who, lets just say it started out wrong from the moment we walked in when the hostess was the most unenthusiastic person i have ever met, if you hate your job that bad then just quit. When my wife, our daughter, and i were finally sat the waitress took our order but was impatient with us to the point that she walked away without letting my wife decide which sides she wanted and what food we were ordering for our daughter. Our food came out but not our daughter's, my wife had to request it again. Isn't it restaurant policy for the kids food to come out first? She then had to request for her apple juice which they also forgot. Back to my food, the ribs were cold so i had to tell a waitress that passed by which called a manager and he quickly swapped it out for a ""fresh"" half rack. The ribs were room temperature so clearly they're just sitting in the kitchen under a light since they came back within a minute. Another problem with the ribs were that i asked for them to be dry rub and they came out with barbecue sauce, i didnt complain about that. Then the waitress gave us a refill of our iced tea without ice so the tea was hot. Clearly this waitress needs to be retrained because wow this was the worst service i have ever received. I dont remember her name if she even said it. All i remember was that she was a black girl and we were on table 22. I actually tried calling the store twice to ask for her name but the people that answered didnt want to give me her name and hung up on me when they were going to ""put me on hold and ask"" I will never ever go to another chilis simply because of this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13

Nicole B.,"Miami, FL",17,3,,1.0,11/25/2017,I was a lover of chillis! Never again!!!! Food was ok but doesn't compare to their old menu. The service was horrible!!!!! Our waitress apparently had her sister and friends in the table behind us and ignored us. Appetizer came after our food. We had to chase her down for napkins and refills. Once the food was taken away we weren't asked if needed anything like dessert. Not to mention we didn't have that little kiosk at our table. We sat there for a some time while she socialized. My husband had to go ask her for the check and her lame ass excuse... she's training somebody and is bombarded (not hectic enough to socialize though) never again!!!!!

Anthony G.,"Homestead, FL",51,173,301,4.0,12/18/2016,"At at chilis today. Typical chilis quality which is pretty good and gets the job done.  What made the experience was the service. Our server was Tatiana (I think that's how to spell her name). Awesome server, friendly and attentive. We never had to ask her for refills....she would always be checking her tables and when she noticed a table was running low she would quickly make sure we got new drinks.

Alexandre H.,"Miami, FL",257,253,121,3.0,7/23/2016,"This is a difficult review to write. I have come to this Chili's several times, and almost every time the overall experience is very different. I believe the problem is that they are almost always very crowded, working beyond capacity, which puts a lot of pressure on the serving and cooking staff. Service quality depends a lot on the person that will serve you. I have had great service, and I have had awful service (to the point of almost standing up and walking out without paying my bill, and screw it all, in anger). The overwhelming crowds create parking problems (most people park at Walmart and walk over), cleanliness problems (yes, the place does not feel clean, as a restaurant should always), frequent errors on orders (ours was wrong last night), staff that is missing in action, and the place is extremely loud, making it hard to even have a normal conversation with your table mates (wait till the kids start screaming, then it feels like a nut house). But ok, got the bad off my chest, here's the good: - Prices are good, and they have specials like 2 entrees for $20, including fajitas, great deal. - Drinks are always 2-for-1, order a beer get two mugs, nice ($3.79 Bud Light, 2 mugs) - The place is fun, if you are younger than me - Most staff members do they best to control chaos, and I feel for them. Kudos to those that keep their cool and try their best to serve well. - Food quality and taste is above average, I never had a dish I didn't like. So, here you have it: if you are ready for a hectic and noisy experience, with good food and decent prices, and can be forgiving if things don't go exactly as you wished, this Chili's the ticket. But if you want quiet and great service, with excellent dishes but a bit more expensive, go to Tony Roma's up 87th ave close to 33rd street, it is the ideal alternative. Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13
Carolina F.,"Miami, FL",12,7,,1.0,3/31/2017,"Terrible experience, fajitas not good at all  The only good thing was the 2for1 beer  But it you want to eat don't come to chili's you end up with an upset stomach  Restrooms are filthy dirty",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13
Adriana R.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,2,,5.0,8/31/2017,Chilli  is one of my favorite restaurants ever!  The server was wonderful and prompted with our food. And our glasses were never empty. I love to go to this place in Doral it's the best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13
Monica F.,"Miami, FL",0,9,11,4.0,4/23/2017,"The food was yummy and our waitress Yeisel was very nice and attentive. She was very professional and brought us water even though we didn't ask for it which is something that we appreciated since many waiters and waitresses forget that simple touch. the only reason I am only giving four stars is because the service was wonderful but the food took extremely long to come out from the kitchen our waitress even asked the manager to come to our table to apologize, we never complained about the delay but it was nice that they came to just advise us that things were taking long in the kitchen while we were waiting for our food several tables around us didn't even wait to get their order they just got up and left.

Seeranie M.,"Miami, FL",34,4,5,2.0,9/17/2016,"This is my second visit to this location and sadly nothing had changed. The food was brought out in a semi warm temperature. I always order the fajita trio, which I have to say, it not worth having if it doesn't come out sizzling. Our tortillas were brought out with no cover. Within minutes they were hard and dry. Our usual appetizer of the skillet Queso was watery and it barely had any meat. The nachos for the Queso were clumped up, greasy and stale. Both visits merit the same complaints. The only reason the location gets an extra staff is because of out waitress. She was on the ball, friendly and outgoing. We only saw her a couple of times being that she was running around but she made those minutes exceptional. Not too sure if I can waste anymore money at this location again. We are very disappointed with this spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13
Daniella C.,"Miami, FL",40,88,331,3.0,10/13/2016,"I went there last night to eat after house of horror. Or waitress was really sweet and attentive. If I'd ever go back it would be because of her honestly. I waited way too long for my food, over an hour. The manager came and apologized and fixed an order that was wrong which was thoughtful. When the food came, it was okay, not really a big deal. I'm not crazy about chain restaurants because I feel that they don't pay attention to the quality of service but our waitress was great it was just the kitchen that was way too slow, I'm assuming. If I'd go back it would be for happy hour. Not necessarily to sit down and eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13

Drinks, appetizers, refills, etc. Waitress wrote down the order and still managed to bring the incorrect side orders to one of us. Once corrected, she was confused and didn't understand that the order was wrong. She also forgot my side order of ranch and my partners beer. Then, when the correct side order arrived, it was freezing cold Mac and cheese which we had to return.

Yaoska P.,"Miami, FL",33,33,16,3.0,5/5/2016,"I give this chillis an average rating because it can go smoothly or just plain bad. The food is pretty tasty, so can't complain there. However, sometimes the staff can be rude. It depends on who you get as your server, but sometimes they're just not having it. They can take long at times as well, but I'm guessing sometimes they're overcrowded and understaffed. Their biggest hits are the margaritas, the 2 for 1 drinks and of course their molten. They're 2 for $20 also gives people a chance to have a quick meal for a moderate price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13?start=40
Sugey Z.,"Miami, FL",6,14,21,1.0,7/20/2015,"I am very very disappointed in what I received in this Chili's.  I love Chili's. It's my go to place for a casual night out with friends, a nice place to eat. I usually go to the one by Dadeland Mall but I decided to try something new. How unfortunate.  I ordered carry out: Two orders of Honey Chipotle Crispers with southwestern mac & cheese and fully loaded mashed potatoes. I was running a bit late because of rush hour traffic, so I called to make sure my food was still there. It took them 10 minutes to be able to tell my my food was there. But hey! It's fine. I'm sure they were very busy.  I finally get there, extremely happy that I was going to eat some amazing food that I had been craving all day. I'm checking my order and I see that I was given fries. Hmm. I don't remember asking for fries. I tell the waitress that I asked for southwestern mac & cheese. So I'm late, and they STILL get my order wrong. At this point, I'm very annoyed.  I take a seat, waiting for my mac & cheese. THIRTY MINUTES later, my first order comes out. Have to wait another FIFTEEN for my second order to come out. I ordered carry out because I wanted to quickly leave. This wasn't the case here. I was extremely upset. No way I'm going back.  On the plus side, the mac & cheese was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13?start=40

Cesar L.,"Charleston, SC",88,305,307,1.0,1/7/2015,"We had visited this place before and although it was a disappointing experience, we decided to give them a 2nd change. Well, this will be the last time and we recommend you take your hard earned money someplace else. We ordered the guacamole and although my finger was pointing on the menu to the guacamole we wanted, the server brought us the wrong thing. We decided to keep it anyway. The appetizer had a side of guacamole and salsa with chips. The guacamole had chunks of guacamole, one so big that it took literally 2/3 of the cup. I called the server (Marino) to complaint about the dish. He stated that I didn't specified which guacamole I wanted, seriously??? So you are telling me there are two kinds of guacamole being offered and you took it upon yourself to order whatever seemed appropriate without asking me to clarify which one I really wanted, disregarding the fact that my finger clearly was pointing at the guacamole dish advertised as being prepared by the table and serve on a big dish?? Anyway, he called the Manager who comp the appetizer since we didn't even touch it. I ordered a draft beer (blue moon). Again, the server didn't even mention there was a happy hour, so he brought two glasses without asking if I wanted both at the same time. Therefore after drinking the first glass, the 2nd one was already warm. We also ordered chicken wings and Cajun chicken pasta. Again, nothing especial on either dish. In a nutshell, stay away from this place. They have problems starting at the top. One last point; NFL playoffs were playing on T.V., however only the bar area have T.V.s. The main seating areas around the bar don't have T.V.s. I was told they are working on it. Stay away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13?start=40

As a party of 15 we always understand that the wait time will be a bit longer than most. We visit this chilis on 3/20/16 and since the moment we walked in the Host Angie was very blunt and unwelcoming. She told us the wait was 2 hours, we still wrote down our name and called the hooters right next door they gave us a wait time of 30 mins. We were contemplating since Chilis is always our first choice. As we waited the girls decided to use the restroom and we bumped into another host, Jaz. She told us she didn't think the time frame was correct, and that we were probably be in within 40 mins to an hour tops! Within 20 mins we got our table!

First visit was an undercooked slimy chicken. The second visit was drink cocktails that were half done, chicken that was (still) unbearable, fries that even I an avid fry eater could not continue to eat.

Long story short, food came my brothers was perfect. Grandmothers stake was NOT WELL DONE. Mines HAD PEPPERS, no spicy. My moms NO PEPPERS AND SPICY. I had to ask a DIFFERENT waiter to take my grandmothers steak back because ours was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. As far as my plate & my moms I personally was just over it at that point, we did not realized we had each other's plate until later on, my mom did not felt the SPICY until about half way into the plate, was building up at which point she needed water, I made a signal to our server, to which she acknowledged me but never came by instead went to the table next to us to get payment, I was done, I stood up went to her and asked her for water for my mom, she says yes I'll be right over, as I am sitting down and we are waiting for water my mom told me where is she? And looks back only to see OUR SERVER having a FULL ON CONVERSATION & LAUGHING with other servers at that point I stood up went to the bar and told a girl that i just wanted water at that point we are just leaving and never coming back, I told her about the food and how they are allergic to spice she asked what table I was on, showed her and went back to it, she then brought 3 cups of water.  I paid and we left.  I do have to say that girl, I wished I had gotten her name, the one that took us the water, was the only right person there, at least that attended us other than the GUY (not our server) that took my grandmothers steak back. Only those 2 were good. It's really a shame! I never had a problem like this or even close at any chilis. They just lost me and anyone remotely close to me as a customer.  Just HORRIBLE SERVICE, from the extra charging for the food, (which I gotten substituted before, today they didn't want to it, because they didn't, but I know could be done) to the unprofessional treatment by the server, confusing all the foods and sides, to the lack of attention for simple WATER!  I only hope my mother is okay, and that simple mistake from their end doesn't harm her because it that turns out to be the case, that would be a different ball game, for Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13?start=20

Randy R.,"Homestead, FL",198,134,358,4.0,11/18/2015,Well this will be my 3rd time coming to this chilis and enjoying good service. I have came twice for lunch and once for dinner. Yet to experience bad service or waits. This location is super busy but efficient and always moving. Their food comes out pretty quick and hot which obviously is important to anyone. I finally tried the Smoked Carnitas burrito and it was pretty good. I really enjoyed their spinach cheese dip with chips and salsa. That stuff was fire!  Overall its a nice spot to hangout and grab some grub with friends or family. Phone service kinda sucks depending where you sit and there is no wifi. If you sit by the bar you get free chips and salsa!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13?start=20
Crystal M.,"Miami, FL",259,14,15,2.0,8/13/2017,"Usually I love Chilis. I used the app to wait in line, Uber's here and when we arrived we got seated right away. However the food took long, when it finally arrived it was cold and it was sloppy. I ordered the triple dipper appetizer as an entre with the south western egg rolls, the cheddar bites, and the honey-chipotle crispers. When it arrived the dipping sauces were spilled all over the food and mixed in together. We also got the new smoke house combo that looked delicious on the menu. It came with house smoked BBQ ribs, hand battered chicken crispers, roasted sweet corn, home style fries, chili-garlic toast, and garlic dill pickles. When it arrived the corn was plain and 1/2 the size (unlike the picture and description), the ribs barely had any meat on it. Bones with BBQ sauce. Honestly it seemed like the kitchen people really didn't care what product they were putting out. The bar was worse, we ordered blue long islands, and it tasted like cleaning products. Honestly horrible. I usually don't like sending things back, but the drink was truly unbearable. We stuck with the regular long islands, which wasn't too much better. Our waitress was great though, she honestly had nothing to do with the bad experience we had. I would rather drive further and go to a better chilis than come back here; 10 mins away from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13?start=20

At first thy brought only two of the three meals. The third meal took another 30-40 minutes and by then wasn't even wanted. The manager had no proper customer service communication skills and although he comped PART of the bill, he wasn't sympathetic whatsoever. If you ask me, everything should've been free.

Finally 45 minutes later we finally meet the server and the drinks took another 25 minutes where the appetizer arrived before the drinks. The right when the food arrived there were no utensils on the table and we had to wait another 10 minutes to see our server so we can get our utensils to be able to eat our meal. One of the guys I was sitting down when he went to move his chair forward almost slipped and fell on the floor because the floor was slippery and dirty it was very unhygienic.

Jose V.,"Miami, FL",84,10,,1.0,1/28/2017,This place is pretty bad for dinner. Came here last night and the waitress we had was pretty bad. She assisted us with what we needed which was good. But the table that was across from where I was sitting at was her group of friends. She gave her friends basically VIP treatment. My table would order drinks and it would take like 10-15 minutes for us to receive them. But her friends would get their drinks in 5 minutes. She would also sit down and talk to her friends and there would be times where she would take sips out of her friends alcoholic drinks. I'm sorry but working in the restaurant business drinking on the job even just a little is unprofessional. Also my girlfriend ordered a Bloody Mary to try it out and she didn't like it. She asked the waitress if we can possibly exchange it for something else and she said she wasn't gonna charge us for them but she did. Wouldn't come back here again.

I came today with my boyfriend to eat. We walked in and waited to be seated for about 2 minutes as the host was no where to be seen, servers walked by but no one acknowledged us. Then the host come and we tell her table for 2. She tells us we can sit by the bar area and my boyfriend asks if we can get a booth by the outer side of the restaurant. She tells us that it's slower service so we kind of looked at each other and decided to sit at the bar area and she just pointed to the booth. The table was extremely sticky and wet, the menus were dirty. I tried to put those issues aside because I really wanted to eat there. My boyfriend was upset by the issue and we sat there for 10 minutes without being attended or looked at. We decided to leave and as we were walking out the host didn't even stop us to ask what was wrong due to the fact that she was too focused on her phone. This is probably going to be my last time at this location.

Antonio A.,"Miami-Dade, FL",86,142,1688,4.0,2/27/2011,"I happen to love this Chili's. Even when it's packed, I'm usually seated fairly quickly. Bottomless chips and salsa (best salsa ever) for about $4 are perfect. And 2-for-1 drinks are always a great bonus.  Lost a star because: The drink menu they used to have is now completely gone and waiters/waitresses have no idea what drinks are twofers. Gets a little frustrating having to decide on the fly instead of looking at a menu with time to decide. Off the top of my head, I think these drinks are always available 2-for-1: Frozen Mango Margarita, Frozen Strawberry Margarita, Calypso Cooler, Margarita on the Rocks and that's about it. I'm sure there's tons more but again, the menu doesn't list them. Another reason they lost that star is because THEY NEED TO BE OPEN LATER. Seriously! They close super early during the week and ridiculously early on weekends. Most times, I end up at Ale House or Flannigan's for that reason alone. :/ Anyway, sometimes it takes an eternity for your drinks to arrive - mostly because the bartenders are eating shit and flirting with eachother - but what can you expect? It's Chili's.  Food has always been a little bit overpriced - for what it is - but it's always tasty. However, the new lunch menu (with half sandwich, fries and bowl of soup) is a really good value.

The skillet queso is always great, so are the free chips and salsa by the bar, the Texas cheese fries are always extra greasy. You can get away with the obviousness of the grease by asking for the fries to be extra crispy. We also LOVE the baked potato soup.

Another plus are the bottomless chips and their ranch dressing...  So if you're in the mood for drinks and chips, this is the place.

Fussy F.,"San Francisco, CA",5,45,,1.0,11/29/2007,"How did Fussy get to Chili's in Miami?  After a short vacation in Cancun with my hottie Blade there was a long layover in Miami - time to see my old friends Mr & Mrs L.  We wanted someplace near the airport where we could spend a few hours, have lunch, relax and catch up on the past few years.  Chili's was nearby so we went there.   Bad decision.  Very very bad. This was one of the worst meals ever.  Ick. And to make things worse - it turns out we were there at Happy Hour where drinks are 2-for-1.  Now we all know that Fussy usually likes Happy Hour and 2-for-1 drinks but not this time.  Because Mr. L's usual two Jack Daniels & Coke turned out to be FOUR Jack Daniels & Coke.  He was done with the second and starting on the third by time the food arrived.  His face was turning red and eyes glazing over.  By the end of the third drink his story about the corruption of the Miami-Dade government was getting loud and a little offensive.  When Mrs. L tried to steer the conversation to something more pleasant she got a very loud and unexpected you-women-dont-know-nothing-about-nothing right there in the restaurant. So not only was the food crappy but the whole experience put a damper on an old friendship. Chili's near Miami Airport gets 14 of 50 Fussy Fusspot Points... and 1 Star. I recommend this place only if you want to eat crappy food and ruin friendships. --- Clean table and dishes?  2 of 5 points. Dishwasher spots on everything and scratched-up everything.  -1 point. Dried food on my ice cream dish.   -1 point. Sticky plastic menu.  That was the worst of all.  I had to wash my hands after touching the menu.  How many hundreds of thousands of people touched than menu before me?  Can someone just wipe them off with a clean towel?  Disgusting and -1 point.   Clean server?  4 of 5 points. What sort of low-life-crappy-job-service did Chili's use to find this loser?  OK so he was clean but gets -1 point for having a dirty mouth.  Actually he was hot in a motorcycle gang leader sort of way. Clean bathroom?  2 of 5 points. Why was there long black hair in the sink?  Did someone wash his hair in the men's room?  And it was stinky.  Dirty and stinky.  Icky icky icky. Subtotal = 8 of 15 Fussy Points on the Clean Scale. Service?  0 of 5 points Slow and surly.  I was actually a little afraid of this guy.  Is he going to pull a knife because I asked for some mustard? Fussy says:  I think I'd like some ice cream - may I see the dessert menu? Surly waiter says:  You want ice cream?  We got one kind - vanilla.  You wanna see the dessert menu?  Ice cream is not on the dessert menu.  Which one you want? Fussy thinks:  Please don't kill us! Ambiance?  2 of 5 points.  I wanna give Zero but I'm trying to be fair so they get the same 2 points as Black Angus. Friends from Finland Practical Scale - 4 of 5 points.  Well actually it is kind of practical - close to the airport, easy to park, wheelchair friendly. Food - 0 of 10 points.  Really.  Zero. After several days in Cancun and some really excellent meals, I wanted something simple and light so ordered the ""guiltless chicken breast sandwich plate with steamed veggies"".  It sounded just right. The chicken breast was actually 1/2 breast, overcooked and dried.  The bun was stale, the shredded iceberg lettuce was limp, the tomato slice was tasteless. I asked about the steamed veggies before ordering.  Scary waiter dude said that is was steamed broccoli.  Fussy likes steamed broccoli - it's good for you!  Too bad it turned out to be steamed broccoli with julienne carrots, zucchini and bell pepper slices covered with melted Parmesan cheese.  It looked like the food scrap pile. So the ""guiltless plate"" turned out to be ""guiltless"" because the food was so bad you didn't want to eat any of it no matter how many calories or carbs there were. Price/Food ratio?  0 of 5 points. The food was so bad it doesn't matter the price because it wasn't worth one cent. Bonus?  0 of 5 points. No bonus points.

Alicia T.,"Hollywood, FL",134,96,32,1.0,11/19/2012,"WHAT IN THE WORLD IS WRONG WITH THE FOOD/MANAGEMENT HERE??!! Even though I'm in this area often, this is my first time at this Chili's and I will never go again.  My hubby and I stopped in on a Saturday late afternoon for lunch. We are really Chili's lovers and frequent other locations all over Dade/Broward (and the US). The place was packed so we thought we were going to have our ""regular"" tasty meals. NOT! All we ordered was a bacon cheeseburger and the Triple Dipper appetizer, neither one of us came close to finishing our meal, something just wasn't right and I didn't figure it out until some friends told me the following Monday that some restaurants of this stature in Miami mass produce their food on the weekend. A light bulb came on then because this was the WORSE Chili's location EVER. (same exact experience here as at the TGI Fridays at Dolphin mall, a complete and utter disaster). I guess they stay packed because of so many immigrants/international visitors to the malls in this area? Even the Hialeah Chili's was 10X better than this location.  We would've been better off stopping at McDonald's for a Big Mac, at least it would've been semi-fresh. If this place makes there most popular dishes and keeps them under a warmer (as it seems) the manager needs to be fired. I'd rather wait longer for a meal than get it in 5 minutes because you made it hours ago. Specifics below: Chips & Salsa: *sigh* the chips were not fresh, they were as stale as a workday is long. Bacon Cheeseburger: My husband is not a foodie, expert, or good on descriptions, all he knows is his burger (for the first time at any Chili's location) sucked and just didn't seem right to him, he left half of it on the plate and didn't even finish the fries. He lost his appetite.   Triple Dipper: My southwestern eggrolls were old and a bit withered, it was about 2-3PM and it looked like they'd been kept under a warmer since 11am (or yesterday?). My boneless honey chipotle chicken wings were SUPER CRUSTY as if they'd been fried a LONG TIME AGO and again kept in a warmer until I ordered them, then drizzled with sauce. No, you heard me right, DRIZZLED, not dipped, tossed or covered. That's how I could tell they were so old, they were naked.  They were like plain, crusty pieces of chicken. Some so hard, you could barely bite down on them. My burger bites? Oooohhh, do I even have to go there? The burgers were OLD! The bun was stuck to the cheese, and not because it was melted, but because it appeared they had been again kept under a warmer so long the cheese was welded to the bread, the sauce that comes on the little burgers was dried out, and the meat was dry.
