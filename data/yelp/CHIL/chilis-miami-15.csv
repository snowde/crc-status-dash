Willie R.,"Miami, FL",14,8,3,1.0,9/13/2016,Food was great but the service was horrible first our server instead of attending to us she decided to sit with a group of cops at a table for about 20 minutes totally ignoring her customers then she also decides to get on her phone infront of computer where u put in all the orders and pretends to be doing something on their all the while she's on her phone for another's 15 to 20 all the while completely ignoring her customers again when I wanted to asked her for my check Check she completely blew me off walked away and disappears for like 10 to 15 minutes I had heard this chills was horrible and I will not say that about the food but your service is horrible and I will probably never go back there,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=20
Nancy O.,"Coral Gables, FL",683,242,292,1.0,11/16/2014,"I don't recommend this place. Although it's such a convenient location the customer service and quality of the food is bad.  I ordered two orders of traditional wings and they came out with one order of boneless wings. They were uncooked. Then I ordered a margarita and there was a strand of black stuff (unknown substance ) kind of gross. Then i asked for it to be changed and it came back with no salt on the rim. Then I had to ask for a empty cup with salt on the rim and poured it myself. I wish I was making this up but it was beyond reality.  I ordered fries and wasn't asked if I wanted ketchup, I had to get up and walk across the room to get some.  When the check came, there was no pen to sign! Wow! Really?  If you come here. Order hard liquor only or just drinks and check to see if there's stuff floating in it. Good luck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=20
Mickey C.,"Miami, FL",0,30,11,1.0,7/14/2015,"This place is horrible. Expect the worst when coming to this place. I came on a Tuesday afternoon when the place was empty and the bartender was talking to her co-worker and they looked at me and came over and said: ""What do you want?"" with the worst attitude possible. Like I came here for food, what do you mean what do I want? Then the lady proceeded to act like she didn't know that they serve chili soup at Chilli's restaurant and like I haven't ordered it a million other times and continued to talk down to me in a aggressive manner. So she named me every soup they have; until I pull the menu and see...you guessed it, chili soup. I walked out. I have filed a complaint with cooporate to have her fired. I won't be going back until they do.  If the customer service is garbage on a Tuesday, what can you expect on the weekend? Skip this place completely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=20
Shaneva M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,6,2,1.0,5/10/2016,"I wish I could give zero stars...came into this location almost an hour ago (and yes I'm sitting here waiting on my check), we sat down at the table and it was dirty as well as the seats no worries we advised our waiter of the issue and he corrected it. Our waitress came to the table and took our orders that was not a problem. I ordered the white spinach queso and egg rolls. The spinach queso came to the table with absolutely no spinach I told our waitress as she was standing there and actually stirred the queso to show that there was no spinach. The waitress said ok I'll let them know. She walked away and not even 3 min later she came back with another spinach queso that was so watery we needed a spoon. I told her this was not what it should look like and she agreed and I asked for the manager. The manager walked by twice and finally after I called him he came to the table I explained the issue and he said he would personally make the dish. Not long after he came back with another white spinach queso and yes there was spinach and it was super cold. That was very odd since he came out with a cover on the handle and the pot was cold as if it never been used. How is that possible did u really just combine both of the dips that were incorrect and bring it back to the table. I sure hope that wasn't the case. The manager never came back and said one word he walked by the table several times and I watched to see if he would look at me and say something and he did not. That made me feel like he did something to my food and even if I wanted to suck it up and eat it I shouldn't. This is the worst place I've been to and it makes no sense that they expect me to pay for something that wasn't prepared with the correct ingredients and was cold because we had to wait for it. Do not come here !!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=20
Virginia C.,"Miami, FL",12,52,314,4.0,10/22/2015,"I am a big fan of Chilis and visit most of their locations in Miami. This one is particular is the closet to me and I've experienced a little bit of everything. However, ultimately I truly enjoy it. The bartenders are amazing. I actually only sit at the bar. I feel I get the best service from all of them. Once I didn't like the queso dip, the manager was informed, he visited my boyfriend and I asked why very politely and apologized and removed it. I usually get the same pasta with the same appetizers and it's always taste just how I want it to therefore, I keep coming back. The floors can use something to avoid it from being so slippery. One of the locks in the women bathroom latch can be repaired for proper locking as well.  A nice view while you eat from the outside .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=20

This Chili's has such a wonderful location, yet the food is seriously lacking. The drinks were great and strong as I like them.

Zephannie B.,"Anaheim, CA",92,31,5,4.0,12/28/2014,"There was a bit of misunderstanding with seating, but it was handled well. I am very pleasant with a server or hostess(I think her name was Lala). Our main server was the bar tender. He had a great sense of humour and was very friendly. One problem with him is that since it was so busy, he wasn't able to go to our table a lot. The hostess/server that help figure out the seating problem, helped us when he was unable to.  The food was very good! The steak was tender and had a lot of the flavor! The onion rings were delicious and crispy.  The fries, however, was a bit cold, but the hostess got us a new batch of fresh ones. I was very pleased with her and our server.  The view was also very nice! It gave us a good point of view of Miami.  I am very pleased with my visit and would come again if I go back to Miami.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=20

But now, this Chilli's in Downtown Miami, right by where I WORK, sucks too! I sat at the bar with a co-worker for lunch, the place wasn't even packed. The bartender took forever to come take our order, took even longer to refill our water and brought us our lunch COLD. The fries were so cold. How can you mess up french fries? By letting it sit in the kitchen! It wasn't even busy. Finally, I asked for a box to-go, TWICE, because the bartender forgot the first time. My co-worker and I had to leave and I didn't even get a chance to pack up my food.  The only reason for the 2 stars is because the lunch combos are actually good (when you get them nice and hot.)

Living in the area we visit Bayside very often, because it is convenient ands we enjoy the walk.  There are no good restaurants in Bayside. Yesterday, we wanted something light for lunch so we came here. We have been here plenty of times and the food is OK. The service seems to be hit or miss. Let's face it Chili's has a decent menu, decent prices, good drinks for a chain.  Our waitress Chantelle was very nice, refilling our drinks, bringing napkins, salt etc.......We sat on the outside patio area which has a great view of all the passing boats. Be careful sometimes the smell of the fish can be very strong.  We ordered the chips and salsa for $3.79 all you can eat and some spinach dip. Man their chips are light, crispy and their salsa is good. I could sit there all day eating them. Maybe some Mexican restaurants should check them out to get it right.  The spinach dip was perfect. Just the right amount of cheese and freshly cut diced tomatoes on top.  This is a safe place to come, well the only place that is decent in Bayside, so skip everything else and just visit them....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=20

Nathan H.,"San Diego, CA",3,4,21,1.0,6/17/2013,"I've been to multiple Chili's before over the years and have never had a problem. However, this particular Chili's had issues as soon as we walked in the door for an early dinner. It smelled of some strong cleaner throughout the restaurant that lasted the entire meal. We waited for a few minutes at the entrance before we were greeted, although a waiter was counting out all of his tips at a front table and looked at us occasionally. He must have just got off his shift and was wearing just his undershirt. He enjoyed yelling to multiple employees across the restaurant but never called a hostess over. After eventually being seated by a nice hostess, that was the last friendly service we received. Our waitress took a long time to reach us which fortunately gave us time to place our full order. She did not smile once although she did get close a few times, which was almost encouraging. After bringing the wrong appetizer, she actually argued with us a little before telling us that it would take some time to make another one. Wasn't that big a deal for it being a little longer since it was only corn guacamole. When she brought it out (which consisted of setting it on the table without a word), it was brown--probably didn't take that long to make a leftover batch...  Besides having to ask multiple times to ask for our first glass of water (thought that was the first thing served), our meal actually came out quickly and didn't have any problems. We did get to have the tip-counting waiter come back (thankfully with his work shirt back on) and clear our table. He did manage to almost drop a steak knife on my girlfriend and didn't say a thing. Fortunately we were able to leave, keeping most of our tip money with us. We did get the satisfaction of watching the previously absent manager actually start yelling at the employees for other issues throughout the restaurant. Would have recommended he done that behind closed doors and not in front of all the customers, but nothing really surprised us there anymore.  Alright, that's enough complaining and I'm sad to say that wasn't all the problems we had. Altogether, the main course was good, but service was slow and forced at every corner. Would recommend going anywhere else in that mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=20
Danelle W.,"Calgary, Canada",89,212,61,4.0,3/18/2013,"After my cruise in March, I had most of a day to spend in Miami before heading home early the next morning. Since I'd never really spent any time in the city, I spent most of the day on the hop on, hop off buses and exploring Miami. It wasn't sweltering but still pretty sunny and muggy.  Since I know Mexican is pretty easy to swing with my dairy allergy (minus the cheese and sour cream) I decided to head to Chili's in the Bayside Market. Oh, and I love margaritas. Really love. They have an indoor restaurant and an outdoor, covered bar area. I opted to sit at the bar since it was outside and less noisy/crowded.  The bartender was awesome - he had a good sense of humour despite being very busy serving all the bar customers in addition to the tables in the bar area. The El Presidente margarita was ample and yummy - I should know... I had two. I also had the tequila grilled chicken, which was divine. Cooked well and tonnes of food, as usually happens in the States (I ended up taking the beans & rice back to the hotel and eating for light dinner). All in all, a fun experience and exactly what I needed when I was feeling pretty tired and overwhelmed.

The outdoor seating is the way to go because it looks over the water at Bayside and you can see all the boats going in and out. My only problem with this Chili's was that unlike every other Chili's in Miami it did not have the 2 for 1 specials on all drinks.

Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",937,1412,6952,3.0,1/4/2018,"Sadly as it is, I don't really expect much when I come to a Chili's, ESPECIALLY when a Chili's in such a tourist trap like this Chili's is. Hungry, not caring what to eat, we came in here one evening after a very long day of travel. The location is on the second story of the Bayside Market in Miami. It was somewhat busy, but we were able to be seated immediately. We ordered the unlimited chips and salsa which is always the thing to get. the chips are $3.99 and you get as much as you want. What more could you ask for? Our server was pretty good. He had a lot of tables so you could tell he was running around like a crazy person trying to take care of everyone. I ordered their chicken tenders on waffles. Sorry, I don't know the technical name, but either way, it was much better than I expected. The waffles were thick and sweet with a kick of spice from jalapeños topped with their chicken tenders coated in their famous sauce and placed next to is a side of syrup. And don't forget the fries. The portion was huge. Four pieces of chicken and waffles. I could only eat half of it and had to take the rest home with me, sad, I know, but it made a great snack for later. I like being able to pay for the meal at the table on the machine to get in and out quicker.

Just as we were about to eat, this BALD HEADED JERK started yelling at me because of our drinks...""YOU CANT SIT HERE WITH YOUR DRINKS, YOU CANT HAVE THOSE DRINKS AT THIS BAR!"" Other guests were looking at us as if we committed a crime. I told him ""we ordered appetizers you didn't have to yell at us, there are nicer ways to get your point across"" he packed our food to go and my husband and I ate our appetizer along the railing of bayside mall. To say I wasn't embarrassed would be an understatement! We were standing there like animals . My brother and his girl paid their tab and left because they felt bad how we were thrown out.  I was so upset I couldn't hold it anymore and NEVER have I ever had to talk to a manager but this guy went too far I had to speak with a manager. I went inside and asked for the manager I explained what happened to the hostess and manager both asked ""was it the bald bartender?"" ....how he is still working there after clearly having other yelling matches with patrons beats me! The manager spoke with him and ""said you can't keep yelling at the customers"" of course he denied yelling at us! I use to serve and bartend so I know how to tip and I try to never give whoever is handling my drinks or food a hard time. We are great tippers, he's an idiot and lost out on money.

Alexsis A.,"Bronx, NY",114,53,27,2.0,6/10/2017,"Ooh!!!!!! This was the absolute worst experience ever. And I mean ever....particularly because of the way the encounter began. First off, this is Bayside. The location calls for outside seating and drinking. However, their outside seating (In front of the store with a huge bar including 4 t.v.'s) was closed. Mind you....it's NBA finals night. Why is the area closed Chilli's?! On a Sunday.....you all are super whack for that. But hey we wait the 45 minutes to sit inside. The hostess started out with the ""mostess"" by trying to accomodate our need to watch the game. However, that turned into an additional 25 minutes insude. Yes, u read correctly. The young lady attempted to seat us at a table with a tv. But so much was happening!!! The table she does guarantee us.....has 6 seats and by this time the Manager was the hostess. She told the young lady we couldnt sit there and to sit us somewhere else. It was such a horrible exchange of words....that I stepped im to speak with the manager about when we would sit and eat dinner. Smh!!!! She apologetically responded and sat us. #WrongMove The waitress was horrible and the table was filthy. From the surface it appeared to be clean. But the sides and underneath the table was disgusting. Ask me how I know? It dripped onto my clothes and on my hands as I sat down. #JustDisgusting Now the only reason they received 2 stars is because the food came out great well except my son's chicken tenders.

Normally I try and go to local restaurants when possible, but I was invited to lunch here recently.  This Chili's has 3 seating areas: There's a bar area in the middle of the 2nd floor at Bayside which is located across from the entrance to the actual restaurant. It's a good place to go if you're in the mood to sit at a bar and eat (they also have a few tables along the the sides) and people watch in a semi open-air setting. If you go to the restaurant itself you can either sit inside or out. If you ask to sit outside it's actually quite nice as you're seated in a second floor open balcony area that overlooks the docks, the bay and the causeway.

Dirty floors, dirty tables - loud staff (waiter WAS nice) - feel like you are infringing on their personal break or party. It was not crowded, but the staff was more concerned with personal phone calls, talking to each other and mingling with diners than dealing with real customers. Appetizers came out - then before three bites were taken our meals were just shoved onto the table. I had less than 1 mozerella stick before my dinner was brought. Fajitas were bland, steak was ok, veggies were cold and what I tasted of the cheese sticks? Tasted like I grabbed them from my freezer.

A little bit more quiet and love sitting out on the patio with the view of the waterfront and you can also enjoy the music coming from back side of Bayside Market Area. They have the lunch combos with the half sandwich with fries and  a side of soup or salad. Not bad at all. I had the Classic Turkey toasted sandwich. It had your basic; lettuce, tomato and mayo. For my soup, the only one I would get here is the Chicken Enchilada Soup. I can't believe they took out the BROCCOLI CHEESE SOUP! I'm still mad about that. But overall the lunch combo got me really full.  For dinner, we went here after a Miami Heat game and there was alot of people. We got the 2 for $20 deal. The deals doesn't have alot of choices as before. And THEY TOOK OUT THE COUNTRY FRIED STEAK ENTREE! I'm not sure if its only here, but I wasn't to happy with that! That is my all time favorite dish!!! For our appetizer we had the texas cheese fries and I didn't really like the cheese. It was dried and when you grab a a piece of fries, you end of grabbing a whole bunch. I didn't' really like it. As my entree; there wasn't that many choices, so I got the Chicken Crispers Honey-Chipotle- it was too saucy and the chicken crispers were too floury and when you take a bite into you, you can't even taste the chicken. I wouldn't order that again. Don't get me wrong the service was great and the staff was friendly but I don't know if they're taking there time with the food part of it.

We waited and waited for a server and were told that we had to go up to the bar and order? I order a Margarita, which is served in a dirty glass with a huge lipstick stain, Nice! My daughter had a pineapple juice which took about 15 minutes to receive and was basically thrown on the table by the bartender. When the bartender re-made my margarita in a clean-er glass he just through it up on the bar, with not even a word, a nod, something so that my husband knew that it was for him. We sat there for a minute and decided it was in fact mine, so he went and grabbed it. At that point I said, ""We're outta here!""

The minute my friends and I sat down, the bartender started to tell us about his job, apparently he was fired several times--little did I know I would be finding out the possible causes. Watching him behind the bar, he would run his fingers through his wet hair slicking it back then pick up limes and squeeze them into drinks or break up mint *gag*. His hair never did dry, so I don't even know if his hair was wet or full of lime residue. Thankfully I ordered a drink that didn't involve limes or mint.  Having the sweet tooth that I do, I ordered the chocolate chip paradise dessert. Thanks to this Chili's, I think I can now cross this dessert off my list of foods I enjoy.

I was shocked againg , I asked to speak with the manager, before icould speak to him, the hostest stoped him on his way to the front and had a little chat with him. When he approach us he smelled alcohol on his breath, his eyes where blood shy, he began to insult my wife when she demanded an explanation concerning the tables outside, he not only began to raise his voice but he did it in a confrontational way. I asked him to lower his voice and to change the tone he was using .this is when hecame aound the hostest stand and tried to push me towards the door yelling at me "" get out of my store"".

Naty K.,"Miami Beach, FL",282,1043,10006,2.0,9/30/2011,"I'm sorry, but either I had a bad server, or my fellow Yelpers were too generous with their positive reviews of this joint. I came here for lunch this afternoon with 2 of my co-workers, and sat down to eat.  We specifically asked for the lunch menu, assuming the waiter would know or assume that lunch menu = people who are on lunch break = people who are in a rush.  Apparently not.  Not only did the food take over a half hour to come out (for a salad and a sandwich? Really? Did the cook have to run over to Publix to get the ingredients? That's the only way I could justify the long wait).  Not only that, but the waiter lied, which is a big turn-off.   He upsold me and a co-worker of mine claiming the sandwich and salad portions from the lunch menu were tiny and we should instead get the full portions.  When I asked how much extra it would be for the full portion, he said it would be a dollar.  Well, the lunch portion was $7, and the full portion was $10.50.  Now, I have never been known to be a math whiz but I KNOW that there's not a $1 difference in price here, but a $3.50 difference! So in the end, $17 for a salad and coke (oh, and now they tack on gratuity)? Definitely not worth it. By the way, once we asked the waiter about why our food was taking so long to arrive, his personality did a 360.  I guess that was the wrong question? He gave us a ""deer in the headlights"" look and from then on, asking him for anything was met with complete apathy and coldness.  I asked for extra dressing for my Cobb salad and got a sigh.  My friend asked for a soda refill and he just nodded and walked off.  We had to ask for 3 refills between the 3 of us and we felt as if we were asking him to draw blood.  Very awkward.  I am used to more enthusiastic servers I guess.  At one point, when my co-worker got her food and asked him to bring the check (signaling we were in a rush), he sighed and took longer than necessary to bring the check, or so it seemed.  She asked to take her soup ""to go"" and was given a container with the soup.  When she said ""no bag?"", he reluctantly brought a bag...about 5 minutes later, mind you.  I know the a/c was broken, which was uncomfortable for all, including us, the patrons, and I am sure that only helped to put our waiter in a bad mood but honestly, there's no excuse for treating people like that. The food was okay but nothing impressive.  I can get a better Cobb salad from Wendy's.  My friend's sandwich was soggy.  The fries were the only thing on her plate that we found worth noting.  I told my co-workers we should have gone to the food court instead, as we would have gotten more food for less the price and without having to leave a tip and I guess that is what we will be doing next time.  I don't mind leaving tips, in fact, I understand waiters rely on tips and I am usually generous, but if you want a tip, you should be willing to give decent customer service in exchange, and it isn't fair that because you will get a 20% tip out of me regardless, that you feel like that suddenly gives you the right to treat me and my friends like we are not welcomed.   I definitely will not be coming back to this location.  We were not only 20 minutes late in arriving to the office thanks to our slow waiter, but we were very offended by the rude treatment we received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=60

Chili's delivered.  Their Texas Cheese Fries are some of the best hangover-cure eats known to mankind.  Crispy fries smothered in cheese, with bacon bits and pickled jalapenos, served piping hot in a little skillet, along with a side of ranch.  Yum and yum.  Ditto for the skillet queso.  And these are just a couple of the goodies Chili's has to offer to quiet that alcohol still raging in your tummy. We both opted to go a little ""lighter"" for our main course, with some salad choices.  Yes, yes, I know that salad at one of these chain restaurants isn't really a ""healthy"" choice, but hey, at least I made the attempt!  I opted for the quesadilla explosion while my friend chose the buffalo chicken salad.  Both were delicious, but I was too full from queso and fries to do any damage.  Lucky for me, it was just as delicious a few hours later fresh out of the fridge!   Thanks Chili's!  You came to our rescue, for sure!  Oh, just a side note, upon seating us, the hostess was sure to point out the location of the restrooms, since I'm sure we looked a little worse-for-wear that day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=60

Food took more than an hour and it was cold. The ribs sauce looked like it was still for +3 days, and it was cold. When my cousin (who just came from Cuba) tasted the margaritas that were unknown to him in Cuba said that if that's how they really taste, that he dislikes it. I was in shock because chillis is my go to place for margaritas! I took a sip and it was lemon blended with ice and barely any liquor or mix. It tasted rancid and bitter because they had blended the actual cover of the lemon! I know because I have a Really good sense of taste, especially with my favorite drink! That was NOT a margarita!  I then saw the ""bartender"" when I was going to the bathroom. It was an 18-20 year old. What does she know about drinks?

The only chillis I'm safe going to is the one on Kendall drive and 117 with beautiful sightings of the turnpike! Jk. Seriously, It's such a shame that a chillis on the beautiful baysides sucks THAT much!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40
Tina L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,11,,1.0,10/2/2015,omg . this food isn't even good or safe enough for a homeless man to eat. we ordered delivery and it was ice cold and tasted like garbage. should have listened too all the reviews instead of our bellies. the steak was gross no flavor and way over priced. and the onion rings were so over cooked you couldn't even eat the onions inside them.... oh and the burgers .... let me stop... just save your time and money this place needs too be shut down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40
Janisse R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",19,8,1,1.0,4/26/2014,We asked to be sat at a booth and even though their were over 10 empty tables they said we would have to wait 45 mins to be seated. We decided to sit at the bar. 45 mins to an hour wait on food! Asked the bartender for a watermelon margarita absolutely disgusting and she put salt instead of sugar on the rim. The safest bet here is beer. The customer service here deserves a negative rating.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40
E R.,"Miami, FL",0,24,,1.0,2/10/2014,"On February 9th, 2 pm, Went to front greeter station, waited in line to be greeted, asked to be seated outside on balcony for 2 person.  We noticed 3 or 4 tables spread out throughout the outside deck were empty.  All parties waiting were 4 or more parties, asked if we could sit in these areas, greeter told us those tables were reserved for large party, although they were spread out separately throughout the deck.  After I questioned her, she got really nasty and said you will have to wait, I politely told her I did want wait, she proceeded, to give me an attitude and made a face and said ""well, to bad"" Seriously, giving me attitude, she obviously does not know what the word greeter stands for, I smile would have been nice. Too bad, her sour face was observed by others coming in, and they left. That is not how you get customers, no more chilis for our future. Woman needs to go in the back of the restaurant to be dishwasher, where her face can get softened by the steam.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40
Justin K.,"Miami, FL",1,17,3,1.0,6/6/2012,"These guys don't honor the coupons that Chili's corporate sends out to their mailing list. Glad I called first to ask. The response I got was a one word answer... complete absence of explanation, apology, or empathy. The only reason this place is still in business: it's located in a tourist trap, and therefore does not rely on local or repeat business. I've been once or twice, but never leave happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40

Holliewood R.,"Miami, FL",9,4,,2.0,2/3/2013,"We only eat here out of desperation and shear hunger.  Service is ALWAYS horrific and food is sub-par. Good luck getting seated within the hour that you arrive and if you ask how long its going to be, be prepared for  the daggering stares from tired employees.  Just this last visit, I overheard a tired employee asking his boss for a ten minute break. I felt so bad for the guy.. especially when he was denied his request.  If you can wait to leave Bayside to get your dinner, then I would highly suggest you do so. Otherwise, there's Bubba Gump Shrimp around the corner that isn't half bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40
Rachel S.,"East Meadow, NY",743,832,2223,4.0,11/1/2011,"I have a tendency to order things that are not on the menu or to change the menu item around to suit my eccentric taste in food. Sometimes it's frustrating when my requests are forgotten. This time I was impressed. The waitress got my salad order right and kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed. We also tried the southern spring rolls which were delicious. As a matter of fact the menu looked so appetizing, we came back later that day for dinner and had the 2 for $20 menu of onion strings with jalapeno, chicken crispers, and ribs. The food was ok but my friend had to send the ribs back because they were burnt. They were quickly replaced with a fresh non burnt dish.  We also tried the red velvet molten cake which was outrageously good and only on the menu for a limited time. I think I will have to be at the gym 3 x a day for the next week. The best part of Chili's? Sitting outside on the terrace. Incredible views of the bay, boats and the breezes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40

Ashley M.,"Hollywood, FL",781,529,395,2.0,11/20/2009,"We visited Chili's while in Bayside Marketplace today for a quick lunch. They have nice seating outside on a patio which overlooks the marina, which makes for a great intimate lunch while watching the boats go by.  We happened to get a server who didn't seem very happy to be working there, she was very short with us and took an eternity to bring everything out. She took our drink orders with an attitude, and took over 15 minutes to bring us sugar/splenda packets (we had already received our food by the time she decided to bring it).  Other than the service, the food was decent (what you might expect of a chain restaurant, not spectacular by any means, but acceptable) and the two for $20.00 deal is a really good value. We ordered the chicken quesadillas, which were literally chicken (no marinade or flavour), onions and cheese on a grilled flour tortilla. I guess we shouldn't expect much more, but it definitely leaves room for improvement flavour-wise.  The dessert we ordered was the molten lava cake, which was really good. Vanilla ice cream over a moist chocolate cake with hardened chocolate on the top.  For $20 for two people, including appetizer, 2 entrees and a dessert, you really cannot go wrong. If they could just improve on the service they would definitely earn three stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40

Nicole T.,"Wellington, FL",114,110,15,3.0,10/16/2011,"Ehhh, we stopped here to grab a quick bite and a few drinks before heading over to the AA arena for a show. We decided to sit at the bar outside of the restaurant. There wasn't much space, so we moved the chairs to one side of the bar that was completely open. After hauling the chairs over and sitting there for a few minutes, we found out that we had to move the chairs back because it was a fire hazard. Buzz kill, lol. IMO you shouldn't have an entire bar top that is just there for show, but oh well. I'm used to Chili's having 2 for 1 drinks all day every day, but the bartender ended up just making our drinks doubles, which would have been fine if she had told us that in advance. I was sitting around waiting for that second drink that was never coming, lol! I did however enjoy the food. I ordered my typical sampler trio with the eggrolls, chicken crispers, and potato skins. Yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40
K B.,"New York, NY",0,15,,1.0,6/15/2015,"Worst service we have ever seen. The waiter taunted our vegetarian family member for requesting a fajita without chicken then promptly left the table before taking the order of our final family member. This was after incredibly brusque interactions all the way through. We understand the difficulties of an understaffed restaurant, but that does not excuse the utter lack of civility.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40
Danny N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",22,99,9,2.0,12/5/2011,"Meh.. Ive experienced ALOT better.  I should have known better being from South Florida. But I keep giving Miami the benefit of the doubt. Just because 95% percent of things in miami are low class doesnt mean it is everywhere..righhhhtt? I know Miami is touristy but when its not tourist season or some fesstival is going on Its expensive and meh!!!!  I figured Chilis is a chain restaurant and will serve us yum food but after being here I realize that some Chilis like the ones in Lauderdale are actually nice restaurants. This one here is served by miamians and a bit dirty and dingy. And my burger was served and tasted bad. The fries too- they tasted Mircowaved.  This Location was a let down, but thats ok its only Chilis! Cant smoke outside on their patio! Hello, What kind of place is this.

Adetoun Tina A.,"Hollywood, FL",512,156,101,2.0,4/11/2012,"After a Miami Heat game, a group of friends and i decided to go to the Chilis in Bayside for desert and some drinks. Expecting the wait to be long (which it was) when we finally got seated we all order drinks and desert. After our server rudely took our order, a friend from the bar joined us.  Facts seem to be confused. At the bar we recieved Chilis normal 2 for 1'S. Yet when we order we were told they didnt give two for ones.  30minutes after we order our server comes to inform us they had no ice cream and we wouldnt be able to have the one things we ordered.  Very fustrated experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=40
