JorgeandStephanie H.,"Miami Gardens, FL",13,62,21,3.0,7/26/2017,"Giving 3 stars because the waiters and staff are extremely friendly! The place is always clean and the food comes out quickly, a little too quickly like if it was pre cooked or they are giving it to you under cooked, in my case the food was undercooked and not like it is at other chili's in the area",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9

No ice in my tea.  No burger.  The restaurant is 1/4 full. And... I am at the BAR.

Carlos K.,"Miami, FL",740,73,151,4.0,5/22/2017,Visited this location recently for lunch and I must say I had a very good experience. I ordered the half slab of ribs with street corn and they were both surprisingly good . The chicken quesadilla soup was as I expected and probably one of the better soups I've ever had . On my visit I was with my 2 year old daughter and everyone was extremely accommodating and I received constant service . Good food and attentive service is all I ask for and I received it . Keep up the good work !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9
Semaj D.,"Miami, FL",1,4,2,1.0,9/12/2017,"After hurricane Irma my coworkers and I went to chilis to eat, I understood days after the storm there would be some issues but the service I received was subpar. We ordered sodas only to find out the fountain soda were out so we had to pay for individual cans, something I feel the waitress should've mentioned upon ordering. My order margarita chicken and broccoli took an hour to some out, by the time I received my order everyone from my party had already finished their meal, but to make matters worst the broccoli had black spots over it ( not black pepper) so I mentioned it to the waitress and ask her if I could have my bill adjusted. She acted as if I was being unreasonable and I ask her would she eat this broccoli and her response was ""I don't eat here"". If a waitress at a restaurant refused to eat the food she's serving, that says a lot about the quality of service/food at this establishment. This will prob be my last time supporting this particular chilis establishment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9
Candy A.,"Silver Spring, MD",64,14,5,1.0,12/21/2016,"So I am visiting from D.C. And my family members brought me here to have a few drinks. I have honestly never been this upset about service. It took about 30 minutes for the server to get to us... and the serve was just s....l......o.....w......  we only ordered drinks, chips and salsa, and two appetizers for a party of four, and had to wait about 20 minutes in between each time we asked for something. They ran out of napkins, and the restrooms were also out of the necessary products (per the people I visited with). Our server was unapologetic, and it just seemed like maybe they weren't working towards tips?? Luckily my sister accompanied us, because she got up to get napkins, straws, and almost beat the server to our drinks at the bar because they were sitting there for about 10 minutes.  I hate to be b*tch about about it, and maybe I'm just used to the service up north. I don't know how people go to an establishment like this.  I hope the manager reads this, because I'm not from here but someone else may benefit from better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9
Marta S.,"Miami, FL",0,11,1,4.0,2/11/2017,"My favorite go-to restaurant that's good on prices and flavor. My favorite deal is the 3 for $10. You get an appetizer, an entree of your choice from a list they provide you with, AND a dessert! Waiters are really nice, but because it gets busy quickly, they can get a little distracted sometimes. Just make sure to put your cup at the end of the table if you're ready for a refill. You won't even notice that they've looked at it when they're coming around with your next drink. Overall a good spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9
Rune L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",834,27,2,1.0,12/10/2016,"This place gave me the worst service I have ever had in my entire life, anywhere, at any restaurant - ever.  I have honestly contemplated calling corporate to complain about how terrible the service was here. Me and my girlfriend sat in the bar area and we waited for 20 MINUTES and no server came to our table to even ask us what we wanted to drink. That was strike 1. Then we went to the hostess stand ( where there was NO hostess) and waited for like 5 minutes. We were starving so decided to seat ourselves in another section. We sit in a section were there was obviously a server, and still another 10 minutes and nobody comes up to the table. They basically did not want our business. I went up to the manager and he was extremely unhelpful. He seemed annoyed by my complaint that we had been in this establishment for 30 minutes, switched tables, and still nobody asked us what we wanted to drink.  When I tell you I am talking to this man and he is barely even looking at me or acknowledging my existence, I am serious. I could not believe this was the manager. When we FINALLY got a server she was weird and gave us an attitude and said ""I was coming to you"" with this passive aggressive smile. We ordered asparagus fries. God awful. I write these harsh reviews because I feel bad for the owners who let other people run their business and then wonder why they are going bankrupt. The entire staff in this place needs to be fired and replaced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9
Samantha G.,"Chicago, IL",1090,1717,2677,2.0,7/11/2016,"Meh. This Chili's is below the usual Chili's. The staff are not exactly pleasant. And they are definitely inattentive. My first time here, I waited over 15 mins. before being handed a menu or even slightly greeted. I sat there and watched as three staff fiddled with the computer system right in front of me as I sat at the bar. The food here also takes an incredibly long time to come out. So definitely don't come here if you want a quick-ish meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9
Brenda C.,"North Miami, FL",109,2,,1.0,8/20/2017,Waste of time - I am giving them  1 start just to write this review. Sat for 15 minutes without being approached by any staff member.

Crystal M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",139,2,,2.0,2/1/2017,"I decided to come to this Chili's for a quick eat with my boyfriend at 1 o'clock. It wasn't busy so I got sat immediately but our server (Renecca) took about 10-15 minutes to greet us. Took her an even longer time taking our order. When we finally got our food is was cold, like c'mon now really? Thankfully, it was time molten cake! It didn't taste like the original at all and the ice cream had freezer burn. Now I had to speak with a manager. After hearing all that his words were ""my job is not to apologize, but it happened"" WHAT?! We left at 3 o'clock; two hours later for two entrees and a dessert. At least it wasn't filthy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9
Rosy T.,"Miami, FL",37,43,79,1.0,2/27/2016,"Wow! I can't believe that I waited 5 minutes to get a table just so that the entire wait staff can ignore me. They all just walked by us for 15 minutes avoiding our eye contact. No one to take our drink orders,  no water, no acknowledgment, its as if we where not even siting there. The server taking care of the table in front of us was way to busy talking about how over whelmed with tables he was and how upset he was about that to the very table he was taking care of. All other servers seem to be having a terrible time at work as well because they all had a terrible attitude. So I found the host and let her know we where going. I am always so taken back when I get bad service. I get awesome service 99% of the time.

Moraine S.,"Miami, FL",80,74,187,2.0,8/27/2016,Came here after church for lunch and I don't think I too much like this Chili's location but my fiance claims it's better than the one in Aventura.......NOT TO ME........This is not the first time that I came here and they always seem to take time to seat you. When we finally got seated our waitress came and she was great. I hate that I can't remember her name but she was truly pleasant and attentive to our needs and made sure our drinks were filled and we were ok with everything we ordered. NOW........THE FOOD....... they either need a new cook or they're just slapping things from microwave to plate for you without making sure the food is hot. The steak was ok but my loaded mash looked stiff. The cheese didn't even melt on the mash and the bacon looked like bacon bits that they bought from the gas station.  Next time I'll drive past this Chili's to the one out of my way in Aventura. Find another location......not this one!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9

Charelle B.,"Miami, FL",9,30,59,2.0,5/25/2016,The waitress was on vacation the whole time she would disappear for extended periods of time leaving us with no refills and the restaurant wasn't even packed when my family and I got there. However the food was memorable but I expected that since I LOVE the Chicken Cajun Pasta. I usually get the same entree most of the time when I go done here. It was HOT and moist and quite delicious the garlic toast was just crisp enough but not tooth breaking or crusty. We simply wanted to go celebrate and eat after my nephew dedication last Sunday I wish service had been as delightful as my dish though I want crazy about the appetizer and how come the spinach and artichoke has been completely removed from the menu that used to be my absolute favorite must have COME ON PEOPLE lol.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9

Belinda B.,"Miami, FL",38,316,165,1.0,6/8/2015,"Co-workers suggested this spot; we are new to neighborhood, so I took a chance..I gambled and lost!!  First issue, asked for the new Fresco salad, waitress brought me the house salad with two side dressings.  House salad looked tasty, I accepted it - sometimes things happen.  Entree order - chicken tacos ""Miss, please, do not place avocados on the tacos..I am allergic to tacos.""  Order of tacos placed on my table, server says ""Taco - no avocado."" Took one bite, right into an avocado.  Allergic reaction begins, as well, as some strange human reactions from manager and waitress that do not represent proper service etiquette or manager responsibility.    I don't know what happened next because I had to run out of restaurant to the nearby CVS to avoid a significant allergic reaction.  My entire day was ruined as I attempted to control the itching and queasiness of my belly.  Finally, my body rejected the entire lunch and I was left to drink benedryl and drink black tea all day.   I gambled and I LOST.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9

Rick V.,"Miami, FL",0,334,510,2.0,9/7/2015,"I like a server to take care of me, not a computer. You get seated and a ""server?"" brings you a little computer to place your order on. I tell him ""I don't want to use that. I want you to take care of us"". He says OK and I think I am going to get the good service I am used to at Chili's. After too long, he returns and takes our orders. Drinks come out in good time but not the meals. Finally, my wife's hamburger comes out but 5 minutes before my enchiladas (not good). The food is just OK but the service sucks. Had to flag down a guy to get refills. Having the little computers probably allows Chili's to cut back on servers. When I go to a ""sit down"" restaurant, I want to be taken care of by ""my server"".  Not just a delivery person.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=20
Tammy F.,"Miami, FL",44,15,22,5.0,1/24/2015,"Okaaaaaaay! So, I went to chili's last night. I was having such an awesome time, I didn't write a review. Well here goes... It was rather crowded at the bar, but a good kind of crowded. I always go with a group of people I know from Facebook and we always turn the place out. The bartenders know us and the waitresses are very attentive to us as well. For a crowded place (due to the sports games), it didn't even take an unusually long time to get our drinks and food. They even separated the tab for us. Unlike a lot of other restaurants that doesn't like to separate the bill when there's a large party. The vibe was nice, the food was fresh and CORRECT as we ordered, and my favorite team won the game. What more could you ask for?! The restroom was pretty clean and the manager even came over to check on us. Made us feel important lol..  Awesome spot for a weekday or weekend. Very laid back!

It filled my belly, and the BBQ sauce for the fries was nicely smoky. My complaint is related to the service. In addition to the food order mix up need above, my delayed soda refill was regular iced tea instead of the blackberry iced tea that I asked for. Also, the restaurant didn't seem that packed when my friend and I were there yet our order appeared to take awhile.

Myrick M.,"North Bay Village, FL",3,2,,1.0,3/6/2016,"Hands down, the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. EVER. They could have shit in my food and I would have had a better experience. I should have listened to all the warning signs not to come here but my gf was so persistent on eating Chilis that we decided to go to the closest one. Where do I begin, first we waited 30 minutes to be seated, which was expected in a weekend. Once we sat down, our waiter did not arrive to our table for a little over 20 minutes. Following those 20 minutes, the waiter did not bring my drink (and there were three of us) for about another 20 minutes, which he spilled in my brand new pair of Air Yeezys.  That alone was enough to piss me off. My sons food arrived first, 40 minutes later, our food arrives. And if u know kids after they are done eating, they get restless. When I get my food, half of what I ordered was missing. The waiter tells me ""they ran out of egg rolls when I went to grab ur food."" Why wasn't I informed about this so I could make a decision on whether I still wanted it or not? My food came with 2 sliders, the guy put both sliders on a regular burger bun and tells me that they ran out of mini burger buns. Wtf. Again, why wasn't I informed? Btw, I'm still sitting in the restaurant and I have an empty drink that has never been refilled. Worse experience ever. Avoid this restaurant at all cost. If reviews had negative stars, I would give this restaurant -100 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=20
Zainab O.,"Hollywood, FL",256,89,64,2.0,11/20/2014,"I will give this place 2 stars because of the amazing waiter I had but other than him this place fails to impress. My plates for my main course and dessert were filthy. I mean, you could see the grime and filth around the plate. It looks as if it was dipped in hot water and wiped with no soap. The ribs were not good at all. I'm not a chef and I could probably cook better ribs with my eyes closed. The sauce on the ribs tasted like sweet ketchup.

We were greeted by a lackadaisical, surly hostess lacking any social skills who seated us without a smile and when asked if they had a kiddie menu simply stated ""NO"" and meandered off... [minus one star right there]  Well...OKAY THEN!...  But then she was redeemed by a wonderful server by the name of JUAN who proceeded to make the whole dining experience a whole lot nicer. Telling us with a sense of fun in his attitude of wonderfulness such as two for one beers and house margaritas, and a verbal run down of the kids menu which they had simply run out of the paper copies of and we were back on track.  Nobody was mad hungry but we needed some sort of dinner coming from a failed attempt at making the Transformer's movie at Aventura Mall and the subsequent trek around the mall to hit up Brookstones and the games stores...so the kids opted for MacNCheese and Burger and maw went for the special they had, two buffalo chicken sliders and paw went for the Fajita chicken.

I eventually asked the manager to bring a cup of water for my five year old.  He brought it right away.  Our drinks came out after that.  By the time we were about 1/2 way done with our meal another waitress took over our table because the first waitress had to go home.  She asked could she refill our drinks. She took my cup and totally forgot to come back with it.  She also started socializing with other waiters/waitresses.  So...as good as the food was, I have to give two stars because socializing interfered with quality service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=40

Stephanie A.,"Hollywood, FL",0,62,,1.0,1/1/2013,"UPSET ENOUGH TO WRITE TO CHILI'S CORPORATE FOR THIS EXPERIENCE: i love chilis.  but i hate this location.  i've tried several times but this last time, i'm convinced it's this particular location.  i went there for a late dinner with my husband.  i ordered the bacon ranch quesadillas and suggested we share since it's such a huge portion.  not!!!  i'm convinced this location uses a smaller tortilla because the other chilis i go to, i can never even finish this meal and this one looked muuuuch smaller.  also, they didn't have the chipotle? (orange colored) ranch dressing that comes with the bacon raaaaaanch quesadilla.  what?!?!?   we were still hungry so we decided to order wings, one of my favorite things from chilis.  the wings were mushy and not crispy.  some of them were not even fully cooked through.   i wanted desert and figured that they could not mess that up.  i was wrong again.  my chocolate molten came out and did not have that crispy shell over the ice cream.  there was some runny chocolate syrup spread over the ice cream but definitely not a shell.   i am never ever ever coming back to this location.  something is wrong with the kitchen there.  someone needs to check it out for sure.  service was fine but the food sucks!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=40

Neal O.,"Miramar, FL",69,28,2,4.0,7/30/2013,"I've been to this Chili's location many times with my family and my grandmother. There where 5 people in my party and waitress was nice on this visit. We had 4 appetizers (Texas Cheese Fries, Salsa and Chips, Wings Over Buffalo, and 4 Ceaser Salads). I had the Chipotle original chicken with french fries, wasn't able to finish it because I was full from the appetizers. The drinks are good as I had the strawberry lemonade. The service was good overall as I rate 4 stars for this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=40

Luis M.,"Hollywood, FL",1,14,2,1.0,4/16/2013,"Consistently stale food from this place. Nasty stale fries, stale chicken crispers, etc. the Aventura location, while average, is way better. Not coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=40
Chris C.,"Miami, FL",431,333,18,3.0,8/5/2009,"The service is a bit on the slow side, and the people are less than friendly, but still one of the better places to eat when I'm at work. The food is the normal Chili's food, which is fine, it's kind of nice to know what to expect.

Indya R.,"Washington, DC",118,147,69,3.0,4/23/2011,I frequent this Chilis often and here are some tips: sit at the bar. Dining service is terrible. I can be semi-impatient about being greeted so for faster service sit at the bar! I almost always get the mojito with the triple dipper. Double SW eggrolls and wings over buffalo. Great chill spot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=40
Mariam M.,"Miami, FL",180,23,,2.0,8/7/2011,"The food is OK; pretty much the same as every other Chilis. However, the service is awful. I purposely drive a little farther to go to a different Chilis to avoid the terrible service...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=40
Carolina G.,"Miami, FL",0,254,,2.0,5/1/2014,Chili's is one of my favorite restaurants but this location sucks. I came to this location once and never again. The only good thing is I didn't get ID when ordering drinks but aside from that they took forever to even ask if we wanted to start off with some water and the food was cold and took long to bring out. I wasn't even agknowledged as I walk thru the door. I'll stick to my chili's in aventura,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=40
Oscar A.,"Miami, FL",2,4,,3.0,7/5/2011,"The food is ok. I live 2 mins from this location,and I rather walk to the next one.

Mercedes M.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/31/2012,"this place is horrible and most of all very ghetto! i ordered a california club no! avacado, instead of the waitress listenting to my order she (sheila ) gave me an avacado burger, (and through my food at me as she was talking to a co-worker), mind you i ordered this to go! there is nothing worse than getting home and realizing you didnt get the right order. when i drove back to get my money back ghetto sheila decided to laugh at the disgust on my face. i got no real help from the managers, i have yet to get the money put back on my credit card for my order, not to mention how stink the floors smelled from the liquor that had yet to be cleaned behind the bar, and the rude service here. i would never recommend this location to anyone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-9?start=40
