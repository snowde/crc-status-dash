David L.,"Flushing, NY",30,7,,4.0,9/25/2017,Was in the area because me and my lady are thinking of moving to the area and it was noon we didn't have any breakfast and we were hungry so we decided to eat before we went exploring plus I had a $10 gift card that chilis sent me for one of the most horrendous experiences ever eating out at a different location . I've always had good experiences at chilis before that so I wasn't worried. Place was pretty empty for a Saturday lunch time during college football season but who knows maybe everybody out there goes out on Friday night. Wasn't really checking but place seemed pretty clean. Our server was polite and attentive. Food came out in decent time at a good temperature. The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta which was pasta with alfredo sauce and Cajun flavored chicken which is what it said I was hoping the Alfredo's sauce was mixed with the Cajun chicken giving it a little spicier taste instead it was like one dish on top of another still not bad. Overall I would go to that location again if I lived out there or was in the area or wanted to watch the jets game but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. Still not a bad lunchtime experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Charity D.,"Weiden, Germany",80,52,230,2.0,1/5/2017,I never come here but decided to try it out with my sister. She received gift cards from corporate for a previous bad experience. It was not busy at all but somehow we could never get our waitress attention. So we got our own napkins and ketchup. My steak was cooked pretty good but there was no flavor. Also the shrimp was nasty. I could taste the ocean. Yuck. My sister said her bean burger was overcooked. We then ordered the triple berry crumb cake and got a soaked pound cake. The flavor was ok but it was NOT a crumb cake. Maybe they were having an off day but I will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Faith S.,"San Clemente, CA",103,39,140,2.0,2/16/2017,"i said i would never come back to this chilis due to the horrible service i got prior, but when i emailed higher up because i was so very disappointed in the way my friend &i were treated by the waiter they sent me $30 gift card so i thought ill give it another try. this time the service was much better &she was very kind almost made me forget about my previous time. i understand peolle have bad days but when you work customer service you cant wear your feelings on your sleeve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Yani E.,"Middletown, NY",3,13,4,1.0,8/3/2017,"This place is digusting.  Anyone who disagrees should stand by the to-go counter and watch how the food is touched and handled with no gloves.  I watched how the manager (not wearing kitchen attire) poked around plates with his bare hands, and how waitstaff touched food (moved a burger with hands, placed fries back on plate, etc.)with the same hands that cleared off dirty plates from another table.  The floors were filthy and had smooshed fries all over that nobody bothered cleaning.  This place was actually good at one point.  Dont know what happened...but the food and establishment have gone down hill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Adrienne T.,"Port Jervis, NY",0,43,5,5.0,8/18/2017,"Always a great meal at this location.  The staff is wonderful especially Emily, Darren, and Coleen.  We come usually once a week. The point system and e emails give us some special items like deserts or appetizers. Worth a visit if your in the mood for Tex Mex.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Brant R.,"Goshen, NY",0,43,10,3.0,9/17/2016,"Went there for our birthday dinner, food was good service was good, my cocktail was watered down and bitter, I ordered a hurricane, I got a tropical storm. My girlfriend ordered a strawberry margarita she said they were good 2-4-1 . I ordered baby back ribs with Dr Pepper sauce they were very good along with the fries and corn on the cob. My g/f had the sirloin with loaded mashed and corn on the cob. She said it was great. And we finished off with the lava cake, also good would have been better with chocolate ice cream that they don't have. Place was somewhat clean, my seat had a straw cover shoved between the seat and wall and the floor could have been cleaner but no bugs. I would go back but no drinks from the bar",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Kristen B.,"Middletown, NY",0,27,,3.0,6/30/2017,"We don't go to the chain restaurants very often anymore and Chili's style of food isn't among my favorites, but we had a gift card so we decided to drop in on a Thursday evening for dinner. It was busier than I expected for a week day night, but we were seated promptly. Our service was excellent - our waiters (two men working together) were polite and super quick. No complaints at all - our drinks, appetizers and entrees came out fast and hot, and when the tablet you can pay on wasn't working our waiter manually got us the check in literally seconds. So kudos for the awesome service. The food was so so. We ordered skillet queso as an appetizer; the chips were very crispy but a little too oily, and the queso dip tasted good but it didn't seem super fresh - I got the impression it was microwaved. I ordered the big mouth bites and fries as my entree, which were good, but I filled up too much on the appetizer and took most of it home to have for lunch the next day. It didn't reheat very well - the fries were greasy and the mini burgers didn't taste as good, so I probably won't ever take leftovers to go again. I didn't even finish them as my lunch - it gave me a stomach ache. My husband ordered chicken crispers which he said were good, as were his fries, but his corn on the cob was DOUSED in salt and inedible. We have had better experiences here before pertaining to the food, so we will probably be back at some point but it won't be a go-to destination for us to grab a bite. Service is great, food needs some work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Brooke H.,"New York, NY",120,83,494,3.0,1/26/2016,"Stopped in here while I was on a road trip.  This spot is very conveniently located next to the exit making it an easy lunch/dinner spot on the go. Food was average nothing spectacular.  Bar staff was friendly and attentive.  I love how they have numerous healthy options on their menu. I wouldn't go out of my way to stop here as it is a typical chain restaurant.  However, if I was driving by again and it was of convenience I would probably stop back in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Angela M.,"West Harrison, NY",1,29,72,4.0,10/29/2016,Came here tonight with family and we were seated and served right away. The food was very good and fresh- Especially the guacamole/w the chips and the chicken enchilada soup. Would definitely return here when in the area,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Lyra R.,"Warwick, NY",200,7,2,2.0,10/13/2016,Waiter didn't understand that I wanted bleu cheese and brought me dressing instead of cheese. Chips were broken in the basket like 90% of them. Bathroom toilet seat slid on me cause it is loose and that was gross. Kitchen was filthy and hadnt been swept in a while. Food was mediocre and pricey. No thanks. I wanted to take a picture of how dirty the kitchen was but i didnt wanna be rude.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Robert S.,"Providence, RI",122,1126,804,4.0,8/16/2014,"Love their varied menu...from light choices under 600 calories to $20 dinners for 2...to rib specials, happy hours, etc. I always find this restaurant chain reliable and consistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Niya S.,"Highland Park, IL",0,23,,1.0,7/21/2016,"My family and I have been to this location several times with no problems, but my recent visit was very disappointing. My son decided on Chili's for his birthday on July 19th and we arrived around 7pm. Our waitress was April but she had lousy customer service skills. She would constantly talk over me when I was asking a question and rudely reached over our heads to grab the bill that I requested change for. Instead of ""thanking us"" before we left, she began taking orders from another table without uttering a word. I felt very rushed and not valued as a customer. Usually, I would have spoken to a manager but we decided to leave and go elsewhere for dessert.The food was great but the waitress spoiled the night for us and my son declined his favorite dessert on his birthday and he just wanted to leave. Restaurants are always asking how can they make improvements...well you have to start with great customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
John M.,"Middletown, NY",0,1,,5.0,10/28/2016,"A regular here and absolutely love the service. When you stop you have to ask for Steve, Dan, or Jess if not all of them absolutely amazing. Love this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7

Kay R.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,47,25,3.0,12/15/2014,"You know, beggars can't be choosers! What more would a person want from an international casual dining restaurant like Chillis?   It's simple: Be seated quickly, a nice waitress/waiter, decent food, a drink where you can at least taste the alcohol, and a bill that won't make you consider becoming a dishwasher for an hour or two. With that said, Chilli's was decent/""A-OK"".  I really liked that my husband and I played games on the tablet at the table. I especially liked the fact that I was able to pay right at the table and not have to wait for someone to bring my bill.  The food was good. I loved my Pina Colada and I would definitely return.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Rachna K.,"Chicago, IL",46,36,6,3.0,7/27/2015,"So we were staying at the nearby Marriott and decided to come here for dinner. I originally ordered chicken, quinoa, and broccoli. I was promptly told they were out of the quinoa which I found odd. My husband had the sirloin steak. My chicken came out and it was tough and rubbery.I told our waitress and she asked if I wanted it remade or a different entree. I decided to get the same sirloin steak as my husband cooked medium well. After waiting now a good 20 minutes since my original chicken dish, the sirloin was tough and cooked well done instead of medium well like my husband. In the end, the waitress made great strides to rectify the situation and bill and I appreciate her for that. Otherwise, this place was nothing to write home about. However, with the limited choices to dine out, I would come back for a drink and maybe a salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Jonathan B.,"Belmont, MA",5,30,,2.0,11/29/2015,"They were out of both things I first ordered. They messed up our drink order. The drinks were watered down and the food just ok.

Wms W.,"Middletown, NY",2,103,132,1.0,4/19/2015,"Food was good however when it comes to customer service they fail. When the food came to the table I almost cut my hand the edge of the plate as it was chipped badly. Told the waitress who mentioned it to her manager and he came over and mentioned that they go trough so many plates. I mentioned this one should not have ever been used, again he agreed apologized and left. Maybe I should have sliced my hand on the damn plate and he would have shown more concern. On top they now have a tablet on the table advertising all their new dishes. Which also has a trivia game on it, which you can play while  waiting for your order. It's not too clear but when asked if you want to play and you respond yes it doesn't tell you there will be a charge for playing. When the bill came my wife told the waitress, who said if you played games there is a charge. We got the game charge waived when another waiter came by and we complained about the charges.

Margaret A.,"Astoria, NY",69,108,228,5.0,2/19/2013,"Considering it was Valentines Day weekend this past weekend, the wait wasn't bad at all at this place.  Everywhere else it was a 45min to an 1hr wait and although this place was packed, it was surprising when they said wait time was 10-15 minutes.  We got seated withing 10 minutes and were waited on within 5.  After ordering our food, it came within another 10-15 minutes.  The steak I got was amazing and the loaded mash potatoes were out of this world.  My boyfriend ordered a full rack of ribs and french fries ... those were good too but nothing beat that steak I had.  Also their strawberry lemonade is the best.  Next time I'll definitely get the 10 oz steak instead of the 6 oz.  It was worth the trip and wait so I'll be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7
Manny M.,"Middletown, NY",73,274,70,4.0,3/3/2014,Another standard chain. The food was good and exactly what you expect. I tried one of their new enchiladas (chicken) and it was good. The extra star goes to our very nice waitress and the fact that they had a tablet where you could order drinks from AND have your kids be entertained with apps. For 99 cents my daughter played a bunch of their apps. And some were good and let her draw pictured freely instead of playing angry birds or barbie dress up. One of the chain rest I would go back to if no time to cook.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7

Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709,4.0,9/23/2009,"I went to this Chili's to use a birthday coupon because it is just off the highway on my way back home. I was in a party of one. When I got there, the greeter was a bit too quick to suggest sitting at the bar when the dining area was not full but that is a minor problem, if at all. The service and food were decent. I had the jalapeno smokehouse bacon burger and a white chocolate molten cake. The burger and fries were fairly standard for a chain restaurant. The cake was very decadent. I had a decent time there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7?start=20
Rachael H.,"Delhi, NY",2,15,3,4.0,7/29/2011,"I love Chili's, especially the honey-chipotle chicken crispers. The food is almost always good, and the service and atmosphere is great. I went with a group of friends one time and we actually made friends with the waiter!  I try to support family businesses as much as I can, but I come to Chili's when I want an experience that I know without a doubt I'll enjoy. The food is quick, easy, and I know what to expect of it. It has the ""forced"" personality of many chain restaurants, but I really can't fault them for that; it comes with the territory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7?start=20
Venus L.,"Middletown, NY",0,5,,1.0,7/22/2014,Bad service poor food. Close this place down and hire new people and new management. They got my order wrong and acted like it was my fault.

Dan F.,"Middletown, NY",0,6,,1.0,2/19/2014,"Awful service.  I've walked in to get a pick up order and stood in front of the counter/bar at the TO GO station for 20 minutes without being acknowledged on two separate occasions.  The TO GO meal I ordered was cold each time. The steak tasted like some sort of over-processed, pressed-together deli loaf.  I even once received their rendition of a Molten Lava cake, but it was cold with a frozen--yes frozen--chocolate center.  Never ceases to disappoint.

Timothy W.,"Asheville, NC",34,423,37,4.0,8/31/2008,"Feeling sorry for the local businesses, I thought I'd give Chili's some love.  All of the usual chain resto's have put most of the local places out of business.  If the DW and I are looking for a quick bit to eat we will usually go here.  Nothing jumps out as a signature dish but the service is good and the food is edible so I can't complain.  As an added bonus the bar always has 2 for 1 draft beers and they typically have one of Sams seasonal brews on a rotating tap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-middletown-7?start=20
