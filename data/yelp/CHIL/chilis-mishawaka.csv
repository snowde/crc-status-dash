Michael M.,"South Bend, IN",9,68,155,4.0,6/17/2017,My mother and I were going to go to Fridays but I accidentally came to Chili's.  I'm glad I did as I really enjoyed my meal. I had the Mango-Chile Chicken. I replaced the rice with broccoli and got a side order of Fresh Asparagus & Garlic Roasted Tomatoes.  The only problem was my food came out cold so I called over the manager.  The manager ended up replacing my whole meal as well as my mother's which we didn't expect.   The Asparagus were not cooked and were hard. The new batch that was made was still hard. I guess the asparagus at home are the best.   I have yet to find a restraunt that makes asparagus that are cooked and easy to eat.  I did enjoy the meal and the taste and I will be back again. Let's hope the food is hot or the food is going back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Sherry F.,"South Bend, IN",73,49,49,5.0,2/2/2017,"Took my parents out to lunch for their birthdays. Chilis is one of their favorite places to eat. Our visit today was as expected, restaurant clean, waiter very attentive and friendly.  Food was very good and great value for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Travus T.,"Benton Harbor, MI",0,2,,1.0,2/12/2017,"I'd give a negative if I could. I never do this, but literally the worse experience. Food came late, one person in our party received the food after we ate.  Two bills for the table was jacked up and I ended up paying more because I was so frustrated.  I asked to talk to a manage away from the table to not create a scene, and one never showed up.  Poorly managed and if I could hit repeat on this negative review I would!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Obaidullah R.,"Notre Dame, IN",0,7,,4.0,7/15/2017,"It was my first visit. Nice ambience, bar and lounge. The waitress was nice and friendly. I ordered guacamole burger and it was really really good and the aroma of the provolone layer was just the icing on the cake. I usually like my burgers well-well-done. I'll ask them to do that next time. Their default is well-done but it was surprisingly good. Visit again? Sure",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Samantha H.,"Mishawaka, IN",27,6,,1.0,5/5/2017,"Your Cinco De Mayo party in Mishawaka, Indiana was so loud that we could feel and hear your music a half a mile away.  I never thought that Chili's would make it near impossible to enjoy being inside my own home with the windows shut.  This is so inconsiderate that it astounds me.  Apparently your restaurant doesn't keep into mind people who need to sleep or may become sick because of the thumping bass music inside of their homes.  The only way that I could be more miserable is if I actually ate your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Janelle J.,"Bay City, MI",0,4,3,5.0,3/21/2017,"I love Chili's especially on Taco Tuesday, but overall as a chain, the service is a little lacking. This one is an exception. They're super friendly, attentive, and quick! Tonight, I actually walked in, and granted it's later, and no one was at the hostess stand, so I just seated myself in the bar area. I wait and wait...no one comes up to me. Finally after about 15 minutes, a gentleman comes over to the couple seated near me to check on them. As he walks away, I asked if I could put in an order. He apologized and quickly brought me my food and drink. Why is this important? Because this is unusual and I just happened to slip through the cracks of their usually impressive service, they comped my meal. And the bartender came over and apologized. It was so kind and shows how much they care about giving good hospitality, even in a fast casual restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
D J.,"Chicago, IL",1,89,24,1.0,3/28/2017,What a rip-off this place is!! We paid $10 for 6 very small wings. I live in Chicago and you definitely get more wings for this price. Then to add insult to injury the wings were smoked (and were SUPER dry)! We will NOT be coming back here EVER!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Jason H.,"South Bend, IN",270,260,201,1.0,6/20/2016,"Its been awhile since I had been to a chillis. we had stopped at  one on I 80 more for a bathroom break than the food... but I digress, Chillis has updated their menu to reflect current trends, unfortunately execution is awful. My daughters steak was well done.... ordered medium. I noticed... it was obviously not even the tiniest bit pink on the center. The server never noticed.  My chicken avocado and bacon sandwich was dry, underseasoned and served on a tough pretzel roll. My wife indicated her carribean chicken salad was not the best either, full of canned mandarin oranges and the lettuce was limp. I ordered a cup of chili and got a small portion of decent chilli drowned  in government quality cheese. i had to ask for crackers, and they took forever to arrive. Ive never been a fanatic about chillis food or menu selection , but geesus h. krist it was a memorably horrible meal tonight. on a scale from 1-10 I give it a 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Fleu M.,"Osceola, IN",1,18,1,1.0,4/2/2016,"We arrived around 7:30 and it was not very busy.  After being seated it took around 10 minutes before I finally stopped someone if we could get waited on. Our waitress was kind but very inexperienced, was afraid to pour our drinks because she might spill them she said. Later a manager apologized for our wait.....then our food came.  My wife ordered the turkey burger, completely raw.....pink in the middle.  I sent it back, 20 minutes later she got her food delivered from another manager, in the mean time everyone else was finished so we asked for a box to take it home.  You would have thought we asked to borrow his car. Anyway I know its just chili's but there lack of quality employees showed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Brandon O.,"Plymouth, IN",0,6,,3.0,8/21/2016,"We arrived around 5:30-5:45pm and beat the Saturday evening dinner rush so we were seated quickly.  The regular Coca-Colas tasted flat.  The Dr. Pepper BBQ baby back ribs had a good flavor but had very little meat.  The fries were tasty but there wasn't a lot of them.  One of my daughters got the crispy chicken strips and she enjoyed them. My wife and oldest daughter had the prime rib tacos and said that they tasted great.  The service was prompt but they were stingy with the napkins.  I found this very odd.  I can't understand why they didn't give napkins when they brought out the silverware???  We had to ask multiple times for more.  So, since the pros slightly outweigh the cons, I gave the visit 3/5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Oscar W.,"South Bend, IN",0,6,,1.0,3/2/2015,"My friend, whom, for the sake of privacy, we'll call Shmevin, and I were slated for a classy dinner date yesterday evening. And what could be more fitting for our ""Classy Sundays"" series than two frozen margaritas at the Chili's where everyone you went to high school with now works? In poorly lit parking lots across our great nation, spoiled kids are racking up charges from the games on those sinister credit card machines, recently released convicts are enjoying their first over-priced but under-cooked burger on the outside, and 27-year old dudes are drinking Coor's Light and wondering if milfs truly exist. After a brief debate with Shmevin about whether to go to Outback Steakhouse (I've always considered myself more of an Applebee's man. Friday's wasn't even entertained as an option), we shelved our pride ( I did at any rate, Chili's was Shmevin's idea), and stepped in from the cold.  We were greeted by a tired server and a massive lie (There's Nowhere Else Like It), and Shmevin negotiated the details of our table. We've all eaten at a Chili's in an airport: there's no shame in that. But there is shame- a profound, midwestern, artificial lime-flavoured shame- in voluntarily patronizing a Chili's when there are literally dozens of superior establishments less than a mile away. It's a decision that says, ""I don't respect myself."" To be fair to this Chili's, I made several mistakes. Rather than emulating the wisdom of Shmevin's comically over-sized mug of Sam Adams, I opted for the two margs with the girlfriends move. The result was a bit of a shock when the bill arrived. Shmevin also went for the KISS strategy on his onion ring barbecue burger. Maybe it was the deluge of intensely phallic plastic chiles protruding from every surface, but I wanted to eat something southwestern. I ordered my enchiladas as Shmevin looked on through the eyes of a man who knows when fate is being tempted.  I cleverly filled up on salt chips and processed salsa before my meal arrived. It was ice cold and of a consistency that suggested that expense had perhaps been spared on the front end. The onions were as rubbery as they were un-caramelized. A hit to the wallet, a punch to the soul. Chili's are, without doubt, shameless scam artists, sucking dry the husks of those paddling in the cultural shallows. There is something brilliantly pointless about reviewing a Chili's. And while documenting my experience will bring me no satisfaction, and even less notoriety, I am happy to do it. I suppose the reason for that is that our waitress, whose name I've sadly forgotten, was excellent. She was energetic, prompt, and genuinely tactful. I hope she makes it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Ramsey B.,"Palos Hills, IL",401,538,21,4.0,8/10/2015,"Excellent service and food preparation!  Our server (Anh) was amazing!  She always ensured we had sufficient beverage.  We never had to ask for a refill.  Also, she was friendly and a professional as can be.  The food we ordered was prepared to our liking.  The Caribbean Salad with grilled chicken was excellent.  My family's entrees from the kids menu and my wife's chicken sandwich was the BEST!  I found a new favorite restaurant in Mishawaka, Indiana.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Grace O.,"Palos Hills, IL",72,1,,5.0,4/23/2016,our waiter Larry was amazing. Super funny and attentive to our big group. Great bottomless soup and salad. Great experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Mary G.,"Indianapolis, IN",206,104,51,3.0,11/24/2015,"Normally I would never even write a review on Chilis, but it was just an experience.  First of all, the hostess was a space case. She asked if we were all 21 and wanted to sit in the bar, and we answered yes, we were. However, when we went into the bar, no tables were available.... What? We were seated at a table in the normal family section.  Next, we order drinks that took about 20 minutes to arrive.  The appetizers took another 10 after that.  And the topper of the evening.. A locksmith was apparently instructed to change the locks in 20 degree weather and kept the door open for minutes at a time making us all freeze to death. After complaining multiple times, the manager finally addressed the issue by asking the man to leave. She handled the situation well and took care of all of the food for us, we ended up only paying for the drinks.  The food was decent, basically what you can expect from a chilis. I had the chipotle chicken bowl and actually really enjoyed it.. Fo free in my coat because I was freezing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Chris D.,"Cassopolis, MI",8,20,,2.0,6/15/2016,Came in for lunch at 1 pm. There are maybe 6 tables filled in the entire restaurant. Poor service all around. Food is typical of chilis. Hopefully this was just a one time occurrence,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
Big B.,"Shipshewana, IN",1,32,2,3.0,1/1/2016,"For the most part I consider chain restaurants just a step up, in some cases a couple steps up from fast food. As far as chain restaurants go Chili's is one of my favorites. We eat here often. The food is usually pretty good. The servers are friendly. Their chicken enchilada soup is delicious. I like the triple dipper also. People can knock it all they want, but it's hard to find EXCELLENT food in a chain restaurant. It does happen occasionally though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mishawaka
