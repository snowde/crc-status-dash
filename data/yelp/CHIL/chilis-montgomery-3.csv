Ben W.,"Montgomery, AL",37,69,103,1.0,11/1/2015,"Sat at the bar with the Wife she had Corona Rita and I had the crappiest Bloody Mary I've ever had... Bar none!  We shared the Southwestern Egg Rolls. They are always a safe bet a Chili's. The most disturbing part of this visit was the men's rest room....""NASTY"" I've been in port a johns that smelt better!

Rex L.,"Montgomery, AL",5,22,19,1.0,11/29/2015,"The service at this location is the worst I've seen and have experienced ever. Most times I have visited, I have waited 6 to 8 minutes for someone to greet and seat me. Keep in mind, only a handful of tables were active with guests. Upon seating, it was another 15 minutes before being greet d by our server! I really had a hankering for chicken crispers this day or I'd have left.

Jamie M.,"Montgomery, AL",6,56,96,2.0,12/26/2015,We have been here before and the food and service have always been great....but this most recent time was very disappointing.....service was not the best.  Waitress gave us the ck before asking if we wanted anything else...like she was too busy (not really just half cleaning up and talking to co workers and not filling up our beverages),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3?start=20
Jacque C.,"Jacksonville, NC",97,3,,1.0,7/10/2015,"This is probably the worst chain restaurant I've ever been to. Our server got our app order wrong, she kept giving wrong food and drinks to people.

Brett L.,"Ellsworth Air Force Base, SD",0,2,,2.0,5/5/2015,"Pretty standard as far as Chili's food goes, but this is a very poorly managed location.  You're almost invariably going to wait, even if there are 10-15 open tables in the restaurant and you hit it at off peak hours.  Service is hit or miss, but tends to be slow.  My kids are huge Chili's fans, but I'd recommend checking out other options if you can get away with it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3?start=20
C F.,"Atlanta, GA",0,5,,1.0,6/24/2015,"Worst Chili's ever. I get much better service at a McDonald's. There were just a handful of tables seated, and it still took 35 minutes to get our food. I understand if a restaurant is busy completing complex orders, but all we order was a kid's quesadilla, kid's mac-n-cheeese, a bowl of soup, and a buffalo chicken sandwich. The quesadilla was greasy, the mac-n-cheeese dry, and the soup was probably already made. So why it took so long still puzzles me. My always cool, calm and collected husband had to voice his frustration with the manager and just until then, voila, the food magically appeared!  We normally like chili's, but this was a very disappointing experience, especially while traveling and needing to fet back on the road :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3?start=20
Alan A.,"Honolulu, HI",41,82,133,3.0,6/18/2011,"This is a good location for a Chili's; this place is clean and has good parking. You can't go wrong with their fajitas, burgers and boneless chicken wings. I am a fan of their Presidente Margarita, but had one bad experience where it was made too strong; they did promptly correct the issue. Lunch is the best time to go, as they have ample seating.  If you are planning to go as a large group, I would recommend that you call ahead so they reserve a large seating area for you (looks like it can handle 16).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3?start=20

Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,35,11,2.0,11/11/2010,"Standard Chili's food served here. Decent place and its possible that I caught the waiters during a bad time. But, I wasn't impressed with my experience and would have rather taken my business elsewhere where we'd have been welcomed as customers. I had the Chicken Pasta and Fried Cheese. Food: The food was satisfactory but the portions could have been better for its price. For $6 you get about 6-7 fried cheese sticks which in my book...isn't that great. Service: Pretty poor service at this store. Our greeter wasn't friendly at all and our server was stone-faced the entire time. Didn't really feel like our business was welcome at this establishment.

Applebees would have been WAAAYYYY better!!! so so restaurant with novice staff and big headed micro-managing supervision...  go there at your own risk, i can see this being a 4 star for some people and a 1 star for others. a hit and miss place....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3?start=20
Billy P.,"Montgomery, AL",66,5,2,2.0,6/24/2012,We haven't been to Chili's in years and only went because we had a gift card. The food was good and our waiter was very pleasant and attentive. The hostess on the other hand was very short and acted as if we not welcomed. She was not presentable as well.

Alex R.,"Seaside, CA",3,6,,2.0,10/19/2013,Terrible service so far from the to-go girl. All i wanted was to find the status of my order and how much longer it would be. She kept answering the phone and taking orders totally oblivious even after she started talking to me and asked my name. So after about 10 minutes of that she asked me to wait so she could get her drawer of cash. Its a shame courtesy came after the fact that she was being rude. And there was a damn cockroach on the counter,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3?start=20
Rick V.,"Millbrook, AL",26,26,6,1.0,2/14/2012,"Went for lunch, awful service. The hostess sat us at a table between 6 big firemen and 5 or 6 old ladies, had to suck in my not that big gut, just to squeeze in the chair. After sitting I noticed that the whole back side of the restaurant was empty, wtf? I ordered a hamburger, twice I stated NO MAYO (I despise mayo on a burger, nasty!) After 30 minutes, I'm served a burger, you guessed it, with mayo. I placed the plate right back on the waiter's tray and said, it has mayo. He mumbled something about another and I told him no, I do not have time now. He shows up 2 minutes, no exaggeration, 2 bloody minutes later, with another hamburger. So let's review, it takes 30 minutes to make the first hamburger, but only 2 for the second? I repeat, wtf? Against my better judgement, I take the proffered hamburger To my continued chagrin and mounting anger, the meat is cold ( I find this after I bite) and the fries are dried out and cold as well. I ate the bacon off of the top of the burger. As I took took two bites from the burger, I feel obligated to pay for it now. I received no apology from the waiter (who stayed as far from our table as he could get, we had to semaphore across the dinning room so we could get a check), nothing reduced on the bill, and I was late getting back from lunch. I wrote ""This Sucked"" on the back of the check and we left, never to darken their doorway again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3?start=20
Luis R.,"Las Colinas, Irving, TX",234,334,890,3.0,11/25/2017,"Tropical sunrise with a Triple Dipper. Can't beat it. I enjoy the sliders, honey chicken and the southwestern egg rolls for my three choices.  Sometimes the burgers/sliders come out over cooked but for the most part it's good and the chicken and egg rolls are pretty standard no matter the location.  Service was good but not great.  The bar tender looked like she was waiting the tables around the bar and servicing the bar.  Hey, management? That might be too much, when the place is full of people, for one person to handle.  I would come back.  Check it out if you get the chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3

Simon N.,"Lee's Summit, MO",218,62,27,2.0,9/29/2017,"Service was friendly, attentive and suggested multiple items off the menu.  Atmosphere is as expected of a chain Like Chili's.   My major gripe is the food portion of this location.  In all the Chili's I've eaten at across the US, the portion size of the chicken crispers here was THE SMALLEST EVER.

Paris F.,"Montgomery, AL",4,7,,1.0,1/4/2018,"Absolute worst Chili's I've ever experienced. I sat at the bar for almost 10 minutes.

Skip D.,"Enterprise, AL",0,18,2,1.0,8/21/2016,"My family and I are fans of Chili's and wanted to stop in for a quick bite as we were traveling home from Georgia. The service, and food was deplorable to say the least. Once we walked in, the hostess asked us ""how many?"" I told her ""Three."" she replies ""Umm, okay I gotta clean a table I will be right back."" a few minutes pass by as we wait for our table. My Wife goes off to the bathroom while we wait. The Hostess returns to the podium and does not acknowledge me, or direct me to the table. She she just started watching the television above the bar. ""This is awkward."" I thought. I guess after a minute or so goes by she realized that she still needed to seat us. ""Okay your table is ready."" She seats us next to the bar, and leaves. My wife returned from the restroom and met us at the table.  Once we ordered our Entrees, our server and virtually every employee in this establishment disappeared. No servers, bartenders or managers were on the floor at all. At the point where we were going to get up and leave, our server comes to our table with our food, after an incredibly long wait. I get my ribs, and they are as dry as desert sand. My Wife's quesadilla was dry, with burnt cheese and bacon inside. My son refused to touch his macaroni, and when asked why he isn't eating, he replied ""My spoon smells funny, kind of like smoke."" My wife inspected the utensil, and as did I, and on the handle of the spoon it smelled like marijuana smoke. ( I am a former police officer, as well as a restaurant manager, so I am well versed on both subject matters) Our server was gone and we could not find him, so my wife went to the bar and spoke with the bartender and asked for a manager.  The manager arrived and explained that she examined the spoon and could not identify the odor we happened to smell. While the manager tried to discredit my wife's claims, I had to interrupt and explain how bad the service was from the moment we opened the doors of the restaurant. she stated that she was sorry and would make adjustments to our receipt. To my surprise, the entire bill was taken care of. Not one of us ate our meal, all we did was consume nachos and beverages. I believe the staff all went outside together (this explains why there was no one on the floor at one point) all had a smoke session together, while my families food sat under a heat lamp for an excessive amount of time. Once they all came inside, our server probably did not wash his hands and grabbed a spoon and put it into my son's macaroni. I was glad to just get the heck out of there and never look back. Taking care of my bill for me was not enough. Other people will eat here and they need to know what type of food and service to expect. It would be a disservice to not publicly state my experience here. Kitchens are supposed to have standards, as well as in the front of the house. I hope that the right person reads this review, takes it into consideration and uses it as a tool to fix the deficiencies. I love cooking, and I want no restaurant to fail. I however, refuse to let bad food practices, bad customer service, and irresponsible managers get away with collecting a paycheck when millions of Americans are unemployed and would happily have their job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3

Kimberly P.,"Montgomery, AL",0,5,,5.0,7/24/2017,I eat at Chili's around five or six times annually. It is one of my favorite eat out spots. Yesterday my fiance and I went. The service was pretty good. I tried something different that they had new on the menu and was very impressed. It was the honey Chipotle glazed chicken over waffles. It was absolutely amazing! One thing I will say needs to be worked on is them cleaning the floors as there was bits of trash here and there in the runways. Also if a customer does order an mixed drink I think it should be asked whether or not they want salt around the rim. I like sweet drinks and in turn my drink was very salty which did cause me to not enjoy it so much. Other than that I think the staff as always was very friendly and consistent. I'll be bragging about my dish to friends and coworkers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3

Antionette G.,"Montgomery, AL",17,25,1,4.0,5/11/2017,I like chilis . Every time I go the service is not bad but the wait is long. The food lately tho have not been up to part. I usually get the burritos those are good. The other stuff is ok. My favorite thing is desert especially the molten lava cake . Omg it's soooo good . The other thing that's pretty great is the titos punch. The alcohol was mixed well and it tasted really fruity instead of like flavored gin. I usually enjoy the atmosphere but they need to start really cleaning the place because the low hanging lights are starting to collect dust and you can see it and that is not appetizing at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3

Michael S.,"Matthews, NC",0,3,2,1.0,7/8/2017,"Eat here if you enjoy regret.  This is the worst Chili's I have visited.  The racist hostess ignored us as long as possible.  Then when her friends came in she let them jump us in line and proceeded to ask again how many people were in our party (after forgetting the first time when she got distracted by her buddies coming straight in the door and walking around us) followed by a nasty look and response that there was a 30 minute wait to run us off.   She did us a favor, we went across the street to Taziki's.  It was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3
Lawanda S.,"Montgomery, AL",3,46,201,2.0,3/17/2016,"This was my second visit and it wasn't worth it. I ordered some onion rings on yesterday and I was dissatisfied with them, because it had more bread on it than seeing the actual onion on the inside. The onion was very thin on the inside and some of the onion rings were hard and it wasn't worth the $6. Unless they changed the vendor company to where they ordered their onion rings and looked like or compared to  onion rings like Red Robbins or Sonics, for example, I won't get them again.  Also their Double Burger, I was displeased with that because on the meat.   They left a piece a char off the grill burnt pieces including on the cheese and the one tiny piece of lettuce that was very withered, not fresh.  Also I had to have them to put tomatoes on it which came back with one tomato on it.  More likely, I probably won't be going back, unless I'm desperately that hungry for their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3

Ciara M.,"Washington, DC",240,1,,1.0,7/15/2016,"My first review on Yelp, specifically because this is the worst dining experience I have ever had. We were there for an hour and had yet to get our food, also waiting 10-15 for drink orders to be taken and another 10-15 for appetizers (that were decent but not great.  The employees were not at all focused on actually serving. Most were on their cell phones texting or talking or talking to each other and goofing around. After how unsatisfied we were with the wait, we asked to speak with the manager on duty and was told she'd be right out. 10minutes later; no manager, still no food. Finally our good came out and my order really couldn't have been more wrong. Someone else got the Triple Dipper and the buns in the sliders were like rocks, not to mention the fact that the sliders themselves looked decrepit. After begrudgingly swallowing down as much of the meal as we could, I got up to go to the restroom. To my displeasure, I found water (and possibly urine) on the floor, literal dirt all over the floor in the back of my stall, and someone had puked, not in the toilet, but in the sink. It took everything in me not to get sick myself. By the time I got back to the table the manager had finally come back out and we expressed our innate dissatisfaction and she comped most of the 'meal'. It was nice, but I still feel like it doesn't make up for how miserable of an experience we had.  I used to love Chili's in general, but this one could barely be any worse and really makes me second guess whether I'll be back to any Chili's ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3
Mary W.,"Hope Hull, AL",0,51,10,1.0,6/19/2016,If it hadn't been for the good server at the bar i would rate this place a zero.

Sitting at the bar we had to listen to the folks In the kitchen who didn't sound happy to be there at all- food was not very good - I had some of the Mexican - horrible - other half had the bacon Cheeseburger that literally had so much grease dropping out of it he had to stop eating - just not happy and will not come back here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3
Dave C.,"Montgomery, AL",0,1,1,1.0,12/5/2016,"My wife and I made the mistake of visiting this restaurant two days ago. It was 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon and it was less than half full so there was plenty of seating available and there was no wait. That was pretty much the high point of the entire experience. Our server made an effort to take care of things but he was busy working many other tables as well. Why was he working many tables? Well they were apparently short one server, because that server spent almost the entire time hitting on the ladies at the table behind us. He literally stood there for the majority of an hour constantly asking if they were single, what they were into, etc while our server tried to pick up his slack. The rest of the staff seemed to be more interested in standing around chatting than doing anything productive. When we arrived we ordered water and tea and an appetizer of chips with spinach queso dip. The server brought our drinks a few minutes later and took our meal order: for me, the loaded fajita with grilled shrimp and prime rib, with rice and beans, and requested the ""loaded"" cheese sauce on the side, and for my wife the Santa Fe chicken salad. Ten minutes later and we got our chips -- chips and salsa! We were told by the server the spinach queso would be right out. Another ten minutes later we get a miniature pan of melted yellow cheese with specks of green that was barely warm. It tasted like it was made from a combination of velveeta mixed with spray cheese and had maybe a single spinach leaf torn up in it. Horrible! To make matters worse it wasn't the server who brought it, it was brought apparently by a member of the kitchen staff who walked out and essentially dropped it on the table between us before stomping off. Meanwhile the server standing at the table behind us was loudly continuing his game of trying to get all the ladies to come home with him and ignoring his other tables. When our food finally arrived we had been there well over 30 minutes. That would be acceptable if the food was high quality, but it was pathetically bad. My wife's chicken was slightly undercooked and the seasoning was caked on it. It seemed like it was a cold chicken breast heated in the microwave and then had seasoning dusted caked onto it, not cooked into it. My fajita had small bits of slightly overcooked prime rib -- tender but with a burnt taste. Still it was edible. I also never received the ""loaded"" cheese sauce on the side. But the shrimp, oh god. The shrimp weren't grilled at all -- it seemed they put cold cocktail shrimp in the microwave for a few seconds then tossed some seasoning on it. I could only eat a couple of them and shoved the rest aside. It was disgusting. The rice felt and tasted like cold plastic. My wife loves chicken salads and could only eat a portion of her meal. Our plan was to eat half of each meal and take the other half home for dinner or lunch the next day but it was so bad we just left it there. We were already late for our next event because of their delays so I didn't even bother waiting to speak to a manager, which judging from their timetable could have meant another half hour wait. What I find shocking is that the price you pay at Chili's is equivalent to the price at a restaurant like Sinclair's where the food is actually cooked to order and is delicious. The value-per-dollar at this location is virtually zero. The fact that this Chili's still exists amazes me. Other locations are usually at least up to normal quality standards but not this one. Judging from the comments here and how long these issues have been happening it seems like they just don't care.  There are many superior local eateries and even chains that could easily take over this location and perform far better than this ridiculous joke of a restaurant. Please if you care about quality take your money elsewhere and put them out of our misery once and for all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montgomery-3
