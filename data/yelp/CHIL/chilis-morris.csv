Conrad K.,"Ohio, IL",1,7,,5.0,12/17/2017,"Our waitress was very kind even though I was hungry, thirsty and grumpy. Our loaded boneless  wings were more than we could finish and hit the spot. The waitress brought us refills and waters and some of the quesadillas went in the doggie bag with several wings. If you visited one or two years ago, Please give this restaurant a second chance. The food was very good; the portions were generous. We got drinks, refills, appetizer, and entrees for only $40.00.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Chris J.,"Naperville, IL",132,117,35,5.0,11/24/2017,A marvelous restaurant the best place in the world to get food and to enjoy it with family. Price is always right and the food is always good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Heidi G.,"Lincoln, NE",3,12,,1.0,10/23/2017,"We ate here last Saturday evening, since it was right next to our hotel.  The service was good, but the food was not so good.  My husband had the chicken crispers, which were of variable quality.  Some of them were ok, but others were very tough and stringy.  The corn on the cob was super spicy, and was not hot when it came out.  The fries were great, though.  My husband doesn't like to complain, so he just ate it in silence.  My grilled chicken salad tasted good, but after a couple of hours I developed symptoms of mild food poisoning.  I have been to other Chilli's in the past, but likely will never return (and will definitely never go back to this one).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Jeannie T.,"Mazon, IL",0,1,,3.0,9/26/2017,"Just want to say that our waitress Rachael, was the most helpful ever. I am newly vegan with no oil and she talked to the kitchen and got us the asparagus with no oil as well as remove chicken cheese and chips from our bowl. I do wish we didn't have to pay the price of the meat though. Good experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Michael U.,"La Vista, NE",1,11,6,4.0,4/19/2017,"I wasn't much of a Chili's fan in the past, but that has changed due to the new(er) menu. It had been a few years or so since I had been to Chili's, but it was conveniently located next to the hotel I was staying at for work, so I thought I would give it another try. I was very impressed with the menu. I had the bacon cheeseburger a couple of nights, tried the fried cauliflower, and had the bottomless soup and salad a couple of nights. No disappointment with anything! Prices were well within reason too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Don S.,"Minooka, IL",17,49,,1.0,11/23/2016,Officially never going to chilis...at least this one ever again. Been going there off and on for years..most because of its location...near hotel..Expressway etc . Went there last night... got the enchiladas... they were so freaking hot n c spicy my face went numb...l8st my appetite... took me about 15 minutes to get Myself together...keep in India I took about 2 bites... pushed it off to the side... the waitress came over... by the way she was great... great service from beginning to end.  She said a lot of there food gas been like that lately... blamed the peppers...took it off the bill...I tried my wife's egg rolls... they really really sucked...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Lisa L.,"Chicago, IL",0,63,,4.0,5/22/2017,"I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants but this Chilis is better than most. I've been here a few times and can't think of a time I was dissappointed. Tonite I had the $10 special which came with a small garden salad, a black bean burger with fries and a chocolate cake dessert. We upgraded to a cookie dessert so my meal was $12. The food was very good, the fries were so fresh, the salad was just the right size and my burger was very good but it's the bun that made it delicious. The server was very attentive without being annoying and listened to our order and got it right even with my special requests. I really like that we can just pay at the table with the gizmo you run your credit card through so we could just pay and leave without delay. I took a star off because it is kind of loud.  You can hear every conversation around us and have to lean across the table to have our own. Other than that, everyone was very friendly, the bathroom was clean and we brought home leftovers for later. I'm very happy with our visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Joe P.,"Coal City, IL",0,40,8,1.0,9/27/2015,"I have yet to come to this Chili's and be seated in a timely manner. It never fails I walk in & am left standing there looking around....waiting....waiting. Then when I do get seated it's the same wait....wait... I have sat, looked at the menu, decided my meal & ordered on the app while sitting in the restaurant before. When the waitress finally arrives to get my drink order & I tell them I just ordered on the app they look completely dumbfounded. So here I sit, waiting for Taylor to fill my drink or my water, I'm thirsty!  Bad management? Bad training??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Dolores M.,"Sheridan, IL",67,17,9,5.0,8/19/2015,Had a great meal with hubby here. 2/$20 deal was reasonable and we had great meals. It's nice that there was something open after 9:00 in the area  Our servers were friendly and attentive. We got in and out in no time. Love the little kiosk at the table to check-out although we didn't need it as our server was right on top of things. I'd recommend this restaurant  Especially love their chips and salsa/guacamole  yum!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Kelly P.,"Marseilles, IL",0,8,3,1.0,3/2/2016,"Went on 2/26/16 about 730 pm. Place was busy but not crazy. Waiter was terrible,  never smiled once. Acted like it was killing him to wait on us. My steak was fine, except he never offered any options, and just brought undercooked  fries as my side. My husband's quesadilla had no fillings,  was basically empty. He had gotten quesadilla in past and had always enjoyed it. Drinks were not refilled until meal was over. Never checked on us once during meal. The only good thing I can say is when we sent email to corporate they did apologize and said they sent gift card. We will not use it at that location though since this is second time in a row we have had bad service there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Nathan M.,"Greenwood, IN",1,5,1,2.0,8/15/2015,My waitress was somewhat new but very nice. It was busy so I understood that it would take a little longer. That's fine. However wen they bring our salads at the same time they bring our meals. That was strike 1. She had me check my sirloin it was under done she took it back. She brought it back still under done. Potatoes were alrdy cold I just took it and ate it as it was. Good service poor food our server is the only reason they got 2 stars..ps they don't have Caesar salads ?! Really ?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Marvin M.,"Milwaukee, WI",33,175,66,3.0,8/6/2013,"Chili's seems to be consistent from town to town, which is good, especially since the location for this particular Chili's is a little strange. Sex shop and motel next door and right off the highway. Parking in the rear. Not a great location, but inside was nice and the staff very friendly and efficient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Taylor M.,"La Moille, IL",9,32,23,4.0,6/27/2013,Very satisfies after my trip to Chilis. I had the lighter choice grilled chicken salad and it was full of flavor! It was delicious! Plus we played our bill right at our table using the kiosk. It was super convenient and really cool!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Eric H.,"Ottawa, IL",10,3,,5.0,12/18/2014,Excellent food and great service!! The staff was wonderful everything was done fast and friendly!! I will defiantly be back=),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Miller T.,"Morris, IL",29,15,10,2.0,11/13/2015,"Bar service is slow and impersonal, but that is expected on a weekend. Food? Well, being a former chilis employee I've noticed a decline in the quality of their food over the past decade. They did surprise me with a new offering of grilled asparagus with grape tomatoes which was amazing, however the familiar classic ""Cajun shrimp pasta"" was awful at best. I know the prep and storage process of that dish from memories past and I'm not sure how it has become such an inedible dish. Pasta was/is horribly cooked. The texture is like a chewy sticky dough...... (That would be a good description) Sauce was an afterthought, but the shrimp........ Severely undercooked. Clear opaque with a slimy fishy taste which was very unsettling. This is a review based on several recent visits to different locations as far as food goes. Service was par for the coarse. I hope brinker intl can go back to the days when food and hand crafted drinks and generous portions were the focus and stop trying to cut corners with to make money and stay ""competitive""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Lola J.,"Frankfort, IL",0,41,2,1.0,2/29/2016,"What's that saying, fool me once?... I can officially say the Morris Chili's is the Chili's that has forever ruined Chili's for me.  Maybe the company needs to step up their chili's to go system, because whatever they've got going has not been working for them.  It's never a good sign when you go to pick up your food, give your last name and they ask if you are Benjamin.  I'm definitely not Benjamin. Can't even say that I know a Benjamin.  Long story short, they don't have my order. I have an email confirmation that I placed it. I had a panicked moment and thought, dear God did I select the wrong location?? I did not.  While one man looked around in back for what could have possibly happened to my order, another offered to take the order so they could begin to make it. I declined. I chose to pick up food due to not feeling well and their chicken avocado sandwich was the only thing that sounded good to me The thought of waiting 15+ minutes for my food sounded like the last thing I wanted to do.  I don't know what's more disappointing, Chili's or the bad fast food we ended up with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Carmen B.,"River Grove, IL",59,95,17,3.0,8/18/2013,A basic Chili's. Can't go wrong with the ribs or a burger. Friendly and the tables are clean. Have done call ahead curbside numerous times as well and never an error with our orders which is awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
Jef F.,"Morris, IL",2,1,,4.0,11/18/2012,"Better than expected. Ok, I know this is a chain restaurant but this chilis was clean and had great service. Use the new ziosk tablet at each table to order dessert, food, or even pay your bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
m m.,"Ottawa, IL",13,99,42,1.0,9/5/2013,"Went last week on a Tuesday. The WORST Chili's experience ever, by far. The waitress was pissed we were there. She barely came to our table, I think 4 times total. She never introduced herself, was irritated we were looking at the menu, and never smiled, once. It took 2 hours for our whole ""experience"" most of which was spent waiting on said pissed off waitress. I have never spent over an hour and half at any other Chili's locations with my family of 5. The food was subpar, over cooked, over fried. Yet our chicken fingers had raw dough. The corn was a weird yellow color. We couldn't even find our waitress to complain. Pretty sure she hates her job, hated us, and SHOULD NOT be ""serving"" people. It was so bad my husband (who never complains) said how bad the service was. The tables were sticky and my daughter sat in a high chair that was clearly not cleaned Ina VERY long time. We won't be back to have another sh*tty experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morris
