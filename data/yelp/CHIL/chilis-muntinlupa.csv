James M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",583,19,82,5.0,10/7/2016,"Chilli's phillipines is very comparable  to the  Chill's  in the United States, food was delicious  and served  hot and in a very short  time , the servers  are polite and want to make sure  your food  and your visit  to Chill's phillipines  is a exceptional  one , we sat @ the bar so we could  watch  the sports on the tv they had on the NBA basketball  game   and our bartender  name  was Ejay he made my drinks just the way i had requested  i give all the employees  of Chilli's Phillipines  5 stars! I would  highly recommend  u come  and try  for  yourself its worth  the trip! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-muntinlupa
Issa T.,"Parañaque, Philippines",40,203,142,4.0,4/27/2015,"Forget about your diet when you visit Chili's; this is no place to count calories. Their dishes are hearty, come in huge servings, and satisfy that little monster inside all of us that demands to be fed something more than salads and protein shakes, and fed a lot.  I had huge helpings of almost everything my family ordered. Personal favorites were the fajita trio - juicy grilled beef, chicken, mushrooms, shrimp, and bellpeppers to be wrapped in toasted tortillas - and their chicken and bacon quesadillas with just the right amount of cheese to hold the fillings in and stop them from getting dry. To make you feel a little better about overeating and like you're still trying to be healthy, Chili's offers some pretty tasty salads as well. I especially liked how the lightly sweet mandarin orange-sesame dressing complimented the crispy chicken salad. Don't leave without trying their desserts! The skillet cookie is gooey and chocolate-y, and the fried cheesecake, while covered in an unappetizing crispy batter, is worth a try because the cold cake inside is pretty good. Both goodies come with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream, and are big enough to share with the whole family. Final verdict: comfort food overloooaaaad. One of the top restos to have a good time with family or friends with great food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-muntinlupa
