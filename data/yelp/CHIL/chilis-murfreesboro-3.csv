Michelle S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",7,4,,5.0,10/11/2017,"The food was delicious.   I really had a great time for our server was really kind & very polite.  She knew what was good and what was great!   I loved my meal the ribs and the chicken would just melt in my mouth.   And my son got a hamburger and it was to die for, it tasted so good.  He ate it all up in know time.  The corn and everything else was all good. Well, be returning as soon as we are able to go back.   Hope we can get Madyson again.  She is a really hard worker.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Robert E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",215,153,,4.0,4/13/2017,"Enjoyed soups, appetizers and sandwichs today at Chili's. Our party arrived about 1 p.m.- the restaurant was fairly empty, which was surprising. We were quickly seated and our wait staff approached us immediately for our drink order. She quickly returned with our drinks and left for a couple of minutes and returned to take our order. Our wait staff did an excellent job during our entire meal-always being available just at the time we needed refills or sauces. The appetizers were yummy and hot. I had the signature Chili and it was excellent. Others had sliders and fried chicken dishes-everyone remarked how well the food taste. The restaurant was clean and the restrooms were maintained. Good lunch, good environment, excellent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Wendy D.,"Williamsburg, VA",33,3,,5.0,8/18/2017,Chili's on Broad Street is my favorite location! I love the lighter take menu. The food and service are always perfection!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Melanie R.,"Manchester, TN",13,6,,1.0,8/7/2017,"I am sitting here waiting for food...it has been 45 minutes and our waitress couldn't care less. She really doesn't want to be here. I don't know how good the food is because it hasn't shown up yet. I don't think we will be back here. If you have lots of endless time and don't mind bad service this place is for you, otherwise take your chances somewhere else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Valton R.,"Paducah, KY",26,6,1,1.0,7/1/2017,"Never even got a table, the host refused to seat our group of 5 at a table that could accommodate us even though they had several suitable tables nearby, instead she insisted that we sit at a 4 top and have a chair at the end. Will not return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Gene G.,"Tacoma, WA",4,15,15,4.0,11/14/2016,Today my wife and I went here for our anniversary. The service was amazing we were seated promptly the server Alexis was great. The food was amazing both dishes were well made and full of flavor thanks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Jane D.,"Murfreesboro, TN",11,7,,2.0,6/16/2016,"Perhaps we went on kid's night. I've never before seen and heard so many preschoolers and toddlers at one time here. Between the constant children's squawks and din from the kitchen and overall diners, the noise level was chaotic. It's not that the hostess wasn't helpful, I was just so distracted by all the noise going on I could barely think what to order. The smothered chicken burrito wasn't bad, but I'm really tired of everything being served on those smallish rectangle plates which just seem to point out that the portion size seems to be less than generous. Overall, we did not enjoy our experience, we spent over $60 for not terrific food in a tense environment. Sorry, Chili's, it's just not working for us anymore. BTW, always have hated the on-table payment machine which blatantly says we can't be bothered to take your payment in person anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Cheyenne S.,"Mt Juliet, TN",0,6,2,1.0,1/9/2016,Don't use the app that seems so great to reserve your table. They cancel your reservation before you make it in from the parking lot! Also the hostess is a smart mouth.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Brittany W.,"Murfreesboro, TN",108,15,3,4.0,12/24/2015,"Normally pretty great food, but tonight I want home feeling miserable. It was a feeling over overeating without even eating half of my dinner. Service was great considering how busy it was and I'm Christmas eve, but I still can't shake the pain and nausea in my stomach from almost 4 hours ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Dylan M.,"Atlanta, GA",10,29,,4.0,7/11/2014,"Can't stand the food but the 2 for 1 well drinks from 11 AM to 10 PM is hard to beat, especially when Jack Daniels is considered a well drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Allison B.,"Brentwood, TN",0,7,,1.0,12/11/2014,"I am a frequent diner at Chilis Bar & Grill in Murfreesboro & Brentwood. Tonight I had the WORST experience & will NEVER return. I have encountered the manager here before, he is very in-your-face & the staff is never very friendly, so all my other visit I've tipped flat 15%. This last visit really took the cake though.  My license was expired, but I had paper work from the DMV that extended the validity 20 days because it was being shipped in the mail. Chili's wouldn't take GOVERNMENT documents, which really hacked me off. But that's not the part I'm upset about. The manager came over & was completely obnoxious & loud, calling so much attention to me and embarrassing me that a table across from us actually told him to keep it down. I felt so disrespected. Will never return to this location because of the utter disrespect for any one who looks a day under 30.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Jena S.,"Nashville, TN",5,74,16,3.0,4/4/2012,"Overall, this place is pretty standard for a Chili's. Decent food, decent service. I do love the limitless chips and salsa, and the jalapeno stacker appetizer. However, I still haven't gotten over them dropping the boneless habanero wings from their menu. Boy do I miss those! But what keeps me coming back to Chili's is their buy 1, get 1 draft beer specials. Love it! They don't really have a large selection of draft beers, but they always have a couple on tap that I like.  They also offer well margaritas for the buy 1, get 1 deal as well, but don't bother. Those well margaritas are some of the worst I've ever had. But if you're looking for a good quality margarita, try their Presidente. That one even has some Mexican restaurants beat! It costs more, but it's worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Hollye Ann G.,"Shelbyville, TN",14,2,7,5.0,6/29/2012,Great place to grab a bite. Staff is top notch!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Tanya R.,"Mt Juliet, TN",38,31,3,3.0,5/26/2015,"Don't sit near the restrooms.  It smells like dirty seaweed at the ocean.  Other than the assault on my olfactory sense, the food was delicious and the service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Michelle W.,"Murfreesboro, TN",17,4,,1.0,2/6/2014,"My family loves Chili's and used to go there often.  However our recent experience has permanently soiled our taste buds, at least for the Broad Street location.  Chilis was very slow moving this Monday night, which doesn't normally bother my husband and myself, as we like a nice evening away from home.  Unfortunately, as we enjoyed a delicious appetizer (chips with avocado and corn dip) my husband watched a small cockroach crawl on the booth behind my head. I turned to see what he was talking about when he exclaimed, ""That's just disgusting!""  I watched this little creature crawl right into the crevice of the vinyl booth.   We quietly told the manager the problem and offered to pay for our appetizer so that we could leave, but the manager kindly let us go free.  We filed a complaint with the health department.  The health department ""saw no signs of roaches.""  We encouraged them to look in the booths, but I'm sure that will be the end of the Chili's tail, but not mine.  I want to make sure that people are aware of what is happening where they sit their tooshies down and pick up their forks. Beware of the uninvited guest that may join you at your Chili's booth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
Erin C.,"Loveland, CO",0,7,3,4.0,6/29/2013,"Everyone knows chilis but not all are the same.  This location is by far my favorite with amazing service and great food cooked to your specifications because, yes I'm difficult like that:) our server was very attentive and friendly I dare say the best I've ever had and my last dining experience there will be one I always remember. ... in a good way!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murfreesboro-3
