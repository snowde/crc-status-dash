Willie R.,"Washington, DC",83,309,465,3.0,11/28/2016,"I have been to this Chili's many times and generally have found it to be really subpar (with ""par"" being ""Chili's anywhere but Muskogee). That said, based on my visit yesterday, they have cleaned up their act.  The service is often painstakingly slow, leaving you looking around for a server, parched and longing for some chips and salsa. Our server was friendly and came quickly to take our orders. They've really expanded the menu and are even offering some more healthy options like quinoa instead of rice. The menu has been restructured such that there are actually options besides fried chicken/something else, which is great.  The bar service is hit or miss. It really all depends on how the bartender feels, which the last time I was here, was meh.  If Chili's stays on the come-up like this, it will truly be welcomed because the options on Shawnee are lacking. Do check your bill at the end because of server gave us another table's ticket and it took a few minutes to sort that out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-muskogee-2

Richard C.,"Muskogee, OK",0,30,,5.0,7/31/2016,Good food and service. Sometimes it's too crowded so you have to wait. Food is fresh and favorable     They change the menu enough to keep you coming back for new items.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-muskogee-2
Heather S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",15,3,1,1.0,4/8/2015,I'm visiting Muskogee for work from California. I just walked into the restaurant and received some of the wost customer service. A waitress (Virginia) per the host immediately rolled her eyes. I'm assuming it was because the restaurant was closing in an hour and she didn't want any more customers. We sat down and she proceeded to rush us. We immediately left. Very upsetting to be treated like an inconvenience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-muskogee-2
Kevin D.,"Muskogee, OK",0,14,3,2.0,11/7/2014,"Came in and the hostess say is at a very inconvenient location. We used a high chair and she sat us in a booth that had two chairs so it was very awkward. The table was very crowded with a pay at the table machine and a large menu with salt, pepper and all the condiments. Our waiter was good, he kept the drinks up and took our order well but was not a people person at all, more like a mindless zombie with yes, no answers in a monotone voice. The food came rather quickly, not a surprise since everything on the menu may as well be fried. I ordered the triple appetizer meal with the onion rings, chicken crispers and boneless buffalo wings. Wow, what a let down. Everything was over cooked/fried. Very tough and just gross. The onion rings sounded great on the menu but boiled down to nothing but old oil soaked panko crumbs, the chicken crispers were very oily and really tough from being overlooked and the same goes with the vinegar coated buffalo wings. I will not go back, that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-muskogee-2
