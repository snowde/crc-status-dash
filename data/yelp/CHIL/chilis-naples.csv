Linda A.,"Naples, FL",35,36,69,3.0,8/26/2017,This chilis is so convenient and my daughter is a chilis fanatic. I'm not too crazy about chilis but we were sooooo hungry. We had the 2/$22! The chips and salsa are always good. I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta and it was okay! I didn't eat the chicken but the pasta was so delicious and flavorful. My husband ate the fire cracker chicken and fries he always enjoys eating that. Overall there is nothing spectacular about eating here but definitely fast and yummy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Jenna H.,"Santa Clara, CA",3,2,3,1.0,2/23/2017,"I have ordered take out from this place for the last time of MANY.  Everytime , NEVER FAILS, Mistakes !!   Tonight ordered 2 simple Cheese Burgers, onion rings, and 2 Strawberry Lemonades.   Got it home and found the Drinks were all ice and NO FLAVOR.... A light pink color watery liquid.   Onion Rings have such an awful RANCID OIL flavor.   One Burger had the sheet paper inside of my Sandwich!!   The tomato slice was the last part of the tomato edge, a PARTIAL slice.  The onion amazingly just as shitty.  How can you mess up a CHEESEBURGER!   Well they do manage it to perfection at this location.  The whole cheese stuck to the paper.  Needless to say 33$ down the DRAIN.  NEVER WILL GO BACK THERE!!!!    Do not order for take out!!! This is Chilis on IMMOKALEE RD,  NAPLES FL  ( TARPON BAY )",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Dan P.,"Brandon, FL",54,4,2,5.0,5/17/2017,Service is speedy and friendly not your standard outta the box meal.   They put a lot of effort and live into each dish.  One of my favorites.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Natalie B.,"Chicago, IL",8,49,40,3.0,4/17/2017,I used to love me some chilis but the quality of the food and the service in southwest Florida has a lot left to be desired.  The only time I would say it's worth going is during their happy hour.  Paying full price you are better off anywhere else in the area that is not a chain!  We had the 2 for 1 margaritas and the buffalo chicken bites during happy hour and it was fine. Still a lot left to be desired but decent for a chain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Jay W.,"Vancouver, WA",24,642,605,2.0,2/1/2016,"We planned to meet friends traveling north and this Chili's is in a great location right off the freeway.  There were six of us meeting for lunch.  We've all eaten at a Chili's someplace so were a little familiar with the food.   Between us we ordered a variety of different items off the menu from hamburgers to sandwiches to appetizers.  Overall, sandwich type items were fine, nothing special but okay.  This place is not where I would recommend ordering chicken wings though or even the nachos.  The nachos were pretty bad. However, even more than the food was the service.  It was terrible.  Before writing my own review, I read others and it seems service is not something this Chili's is good at because there are lots of complaints about the service here. To begin with it was very, very slow.  Then, no service items, no refills on drinks and no return of waitress.  The waitress even took a glass of ice to refill it and never returned with it until we asked when she finally stopped by our table. So, I'm giving it a two-star.  I don't know why.  It should really be a one-star but the hamburger was good and the place was clean.  Would we return?  Absolutely not!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Rebecca F.,"Naples, FL",0,3,,4.0,4/26/2017,I frequent this chili's at least once a week . I always get fair service and fair food.   You get what you pay for.   Sometimes things are perfect.   Other days things are mediocre.  I suggest sitting at the booths inside the bar as I tend to get better service there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Matt P.,"Bonita Springs, FL",109,140,106,3.0,12/7/2015,"I have been here several times and everything is what you expect.  I do enjoy the chips and salsa. Here's a tip, if you sit in the bar area, the chips and salsa are free. Otherwise, you pay for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Dave L.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",0,19,,1.0,10/24/2017,This place is garbage. Wasted our time yestetday. I ordered the greasiest hamburger imaginable and my wife had the worst chicken salad. The chicken was rubbery and the salad was soggy. The hamburger was SUPER GREASY and the fries had no taste. This rates as the WORST restaurant experience of my life! Not worth the time or effort. Eat at McDonalds and you won't be disappointed,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Quentin S.,"Kansas City, MO",172,42,56,2.0,10/22/2016,"How can one mess up a Chili's experience? I fancied it nearly impossible considering that it's a chain! Same food, same menu, same everything as the thousands of other locations across the US.  I ordered carryout and everything appeared to be fine. My order was accurate. Food was hot, service was decent considering I was merely ordering it to go. However, my five-star experience was immediately reduced to two-stars when I got back to my hotel and realized I didn't have any silverware! How could someone forget something as fundamental as silverware in a carry-out order?! To say I was livid is an understatement. So by the time I obtained utensils my meal was cold. $25 pissed down the drain cause of a pattern (based on the other reviews) of forgetfulness and oversight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Jamie K.,"Naples, FL",72,614,5,3.0,12/19/2016,"Went to this Chili's after shopping. Sat in the bar and the booth was so dirty, chips all over the floor and table filthy. We cleaned the table ourselves. Service was fine after that, but server was a little busy.  Food was good, cheese enchiladas were tasty and hot. Free chips and salsa are always good. Two for one beers are always good too. Newer location and and kinda cookie cutter restaurant, typical boring just like all the rest. Good prices. Prefer other Mexican or texmex places, but it worked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples

Alexus C.,"Naples, FL",25,1,,1.0,9/24/2017,"Walked in and wasn't even really greeted by the ""hostess"" if that's what she was. She just kind of rudely asked us how many were in our party than without saying anything grabbed menus and started walking away very fast. We got a good table a nice booth and we're happy with the iPad and the games we could play, it was a nice touch considering we ordered our apps as soon as we sat down and didn't get them for at least a half hour later, the ""hostess"" is the one that brought us our apps and without a word just kind of dropped it at our table. We never got any appetizer plates so we kinda just awkwardly ate over the small plate the nachos were placed on. My boyfriend was not ever even given a fork in his little ""sack of silverware and straw"" thing. So we had to share. We ordered entrees which showed up about 5 minutes after the appetizer we waited forever for from the same hostess who did not even ask who's plate was whose, we had to tell her and she silently plopped down our food again and walked away with no words said. Our drinks were not refilled once and or waiter came to the table only once to first apologize that it was taking so long and than when we were almost finished with our meal he showed up again to ask how everything was going and if he could get us anything else- we had already paid. We just asked for a box. I understand that it may have been busy although it was not, but I have had better greetings walking into a Taco Bell than I did today at chilis. The short brunette with the two braids standing at the front with her sour face let me know my experience wouldn't be that great from the beginning. Guess I should've left then. Thank god for the games on the table or me and my boyfriend would've been two very hangry people while we waited. The only reason I tipped is because I understand that is how waiters make a living and regardless of service that man needs to eat too. Just step it up chilis. Word of advice, fire your hostess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Maddie M.,"Naples, FL",2,10,1,4.0,4/8/2017,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE chilis. The only problem with this branch is that the waiter or waitress I get is never attentive. I always find myself searching for the server so I can get a simple chip and salsa or drink refill. I highly recommend the fajitas, though, you can never go wrong with the fajita trio dish!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
L H.,"Naples, FL",0,4,,1.0,1/17/2017,"The first time we went here I noticed a man getting a coat out of his trunk, then I saw people at the bar, in coats. It's a hot day in Florida, but if you eat here bring a Parka, it is freezing in here.  The food is awful for a Chilis.   My food tasted like it was microwaved.  I hate soggy green peppers. Since its like eating in a meat locker, the food cools off quickly.   If you can't find your wait person, they are probably outside warming up.  We have not been back.  IT IS WAY TOO COLD IN THERE!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
John M.,"Bonita Springs, FL",1,21,20,1.0,5/26/2016,Don't even know why I've come to this location more than once because the service has remained horrible every time. I typically sit in the bar area and the service is the slowest out of any place I've ever been.  It usually takes about 10 minutes just for someone to come to our table.  It's never even that busy so I assume  it's laziness on the part of the servers or incompetence on the part of the managers for not knowing how slow it is.   I only come here because it's close to my home and every time I visit it's a reaffirmation that the service is still as bad as the last time. Also it's ALWAYS FREEZING in the bar area.  Seriously even the bartender complained to us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Norma G.,"Miami, FL",340,109,1026,3.0,6/24/2015,"This is your regular Chillis, the difference you may ask? Ummmm the distance from Miami, that's it! The  service at this location was fair, the food was decent but my biggest complaint was the cleanliness of the place. We got the terrible seats...you know which ones.... The ones next to the bathroom :/ well those are the ones we got.  On the other hand the food was ok, my boyfriend didn't like the chipotle sauce on top of the flatbread but I did.  We loved the Texas potatoes with all that cheesy crust on top and the slices of jalapeño :P  So all in all, it was a good experience, Chillis is still a good place to grab a quick bite to eat and even more if you're on a 4 hour long road trip. Oh and I have to confess I totally LOVE their Molten lava cake!!! Yumm",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Terry P.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",0,18,,2.0,4/27/2016,"I ordered ""dinner for two"" to go.  I picked up my food and got home and only had ""dinner for one."" I called Sean, the person who waited on me, and told him I was missing half of my food. He said he found the rest of my order sitting on the counter after I left and he I could return to the restaurant and get it! I told him to just credit me for one-half the bill, plus take off the $4.00 tip I left. He said, ""I can do that."" Well, he didn't, so I called my credit card company to have half the total charge reversed.   This restaurant has always been well below par for food, and certainly, service. While I was picking up my order, another To-Go customer couldn't get lids for his three drinks because the restaurant had ""run out"" of cup lids! Sean offered no apology or ""comp"" to the customer, just the reason. The customer had to take the drinks to his car first, then return for his food. Top notch customer service nor great food is not given here, so don't expect it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples
Anthony M.,"Sandy, UT",8,87,,2.0,10/3/2016,"We love Chili's as a chain, and we usually have a really good experience. However, since the location out on 951 is so slow, we decided to go to the Tarpon Bay location. Service here was slightly better, though the waitress still left us with empty drinks for long periods of time. The food was good, as usual, so that is nice. But the payment method...which is done by hokey touch-screen devices always covered with other people's greasy fingerprints (um, yay?)...is so weird. Also, after I paid, I was typing a comment about the slow service into the touchpad, when suddenly the waitress appeared and actually grabbed the device out of my hand. She pretended (badly) to be concerned about whether or not the device accepted my payment (the receipt was laying right there on the table) while I watched her remove my comment and exit out before I could send it. Then she carried the device away. Chili's, the key to receiving a good review is to provide good food and service at a good price, not snatch the touchpad from a customer and delete a comment. Poorly done!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples

Lee W.,"Naples, FL",0,4,,2.0,5/2/2016,My wife and I stopped in for a quick dinner. It was not busy and Service was slow...they changed servers twice. I had a burger that was overdone yet greasy.

Blue Duck Y.,"Naples, FL",71,70,48,1.0,11/8/2014,"I could go on and on about what was wrong with experience but it comes down to they do not have enough staff in front or back of house to handle their volume, pay the workers more, improve benefits package, do what you need to do to recruit and retain staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=40

Kareena S.,"Miami, FL",203,75,295,2.0,5/27/2013,Wasn't impressed by the food at this location. Service was kind of slow but the server was attentive. I ordered the 2 for 20 deal. And got the chipotle chicken flatbread which was good. And for the meal I got the sirloin with loaded mashpotatoes and broccoli. The steak was a bit over done and the loaded mash potatoes was cold and looked very stale. I didn't touch one bite of it. The broccoli didnt also taste fresh. It was a bit cold like maybe it was microwave. This is why I gave this chilis 2 stars. Hope this review helps.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=40
Marcia W.,"Naples, FL",0,6,1,1.0,12/10/2015,"If there were negative marks one could award, this Chili's would get Negative 5!  We walked into Chili's at about 8:00 pm on a Thurs. night.

D K.,"Phoenixville, PA",10,20,2,1.0,5/31/2014,"Junky, over seasoned,  crappy food. Everything is over-coated in sauces or cheese to cover the fact that it sucks.

Chain restaurants seem to hire anyone,  not chefs with any creativity or skill.  I would always rather spend the extra few bucks to go somewhere and help a local business owner before I pay to some corporate chain that serves the cheapest crap they can order in bulk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=40

Amy W.,"Naples, FL",1,8,3,1.0,10/4/2014,"I work in Customer Service and I am usually patient by nature. I'm older and have a lot of experience but once in a blue moon, there is the right time to speak up about service. We were told a 25 minute wait, which was fine, after all, it was Friday night.  We had a group of eight. We waited over an hour just to get seated. It felt like we had been forgotten.  After we ordered, it was another 50 minutes. The first food they brought was totally someone else's order. It was 9 pm by the time we had been served. We ordered sandwiches an one appetizer. That food was alright. Two of us had the Buffalo salad. The chicken was so soggy and cold, we asked for new salads which was another 25 minutes. Served chips with no salsa, you have to buy that. The staff was friendly but they were so slow! The whole experience was so disappointing, it makes me not want to ever go to Chilis again. I had  zero expectations going in but after we left, I was left with such a bad impression of the whole establishment. The atmosphere was nice but that can't make up for the rest. I will never go back to a Chilis again. There are so many other good places to eat that know how to make you feel like a priority.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=40
Lisa O.,"Naples, FL",10,33,15,2.0,12/1/2014,"We live close by and have been to this Chili's restaurant quite a few times.  I am compelled to give it a review based on the many times I've eaten here.  This is a pretty good location, right off of I-75 in a shopping plaza with a Super Target, this place can get pretty busy.  However, if it is busy, go somewhere else, you'll thank me later.  Even when they seem to have a decent amount of staff, no one seems to know what their doing which causes delays and confusion.  We've never had great service, mediocre yes, but just a few times, most of our visits we walk out very stressed saying we're never going back..some reason we always go back.  We want to love this place, it's close to home and has good food, the food hasn't ever been an issue at least for us, they just need knowledgeable and attentive staff.  I think they tried to replace the staff with these Kiosk computers at the table but you can't order food from them, all you can do is either play games, look at the food and drink items, reorder drinks and pay your bill.  I think it would be great if you could order your food then I wouldn't have to worry about dealing with the half-ass wait staff you have.  Get it together Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=40

Bill B.,"Naples, FL",0,5,,1.0,12/22/2015,"Writing this on the spot. We have been here 10 minutes and have yet to have anyone even acknowledge us in our booth. Not to mention when we walked in, an employee was on her phone the whole time until she realized we were standing there waiting to be seated. When a server finally came by she asked us if we have been seen yet and we said no so she said she'd go grab our server and at that point we just left. The only person who seemed to be actually working and paying attention was this guy with blonde hair. He wasn't our server but maybe we should have requested him. This chilis is probably the worst out of the chain. Each time we come here the tables are dirty, employees are slacking, and the food comes out either wrong or overcooked/undercooked. All we wanted was some lunch and unfortunately we won't be recommending this place to anyone ever.

It was mid day (not even peak lunchtime), and all I did was order a burger to go. I waited WELL over 30 minutes and even then I had to ask what was taking so long because all the other staff completely ignored me in the 'to go' area even though they were NOT busy. The bartender was on his iPhone most of the time. No apologies when the food came and then the burger was overcooked. I'm done with this place, at least this location.

Kristine S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",161,163,588,1.0,4/23/2016,"So let me just say that I love chilis. But this particular location...is a JOKE! There's a reason why it has the star level it does, and what's more apparent is management isn't doing anything about it. Let me begin with the fact I sat at the bar and was greeted by an obnoxious bartender who made it a point to be sarcastic, TRY to be funny, complained about customers and cursed the entire time I was trying to eat. Oh yea and bring your sweater it's a warm 60* in the restaurant . As I was waiting for my food, an interesting incident occurred in which another waiter asked the bartender ""Hey where's the mucinex?"" (Did I hear that right?!) he grabs a bottle of liquid mucinex off the bar and takes it to the kitchen in the back. WHAT valid reason would there be for ANYONE handling or preparing food to need that? If they are sick, GO HOME! Not a minute later my food arrived, my only consolation being that the mucinex waiter did not handle or prepare my food.  I ordered the tacos, 3 different kinds. To say they were overly salted is an understatement. ALL of them.  I had to wash down every bite with water. What's more, the rice was undercooked and hard. When my waitress Jessica (who was actually wonderful) asked me how my meal was I told her the truth, it was horrible. She asked why I didn't say anything sooner and I told her because I'm not one to complain after getting my food, especially if I can't see it being made. She brought the manager over and the manager wanted to comp my meal but I refused. I wanted my complaint to be valid and not look like I was trying to score a free meal. I also made her aware of the mucinex incident. She also asked why I didn't say anything about the overly salted food and I told her I didn't want to risk someone spitting in it or worse. Her words were ""I guarantee you none of my employees would do that, but I understand"".  I paid for my lunch and gave a 20% tip to my waitress Jessica. NOT A MINUTE LATER after talking to the manager, another waitress walks up to the bar saying a customer complained there was something floating in her drink. Bartender replies it's just a seed. Waitress: ok, but she wants a new one she doesn't agree it's a seed. Bartender reaches into glass and removes seed. Waitresses response: Ok let me stand here a minute so she thinks we're making a new one. YUP that's it! None of your employees would spit in my food if I complained, but they would certainly get drugged up on mucinex and reach their fingers in your glass.

Michael B.,"Naples, FL",22,32,2,4.0,9/16/2016,Patricia our server was great.  So friendly and was smiling the whole time.  The food was good.  It's chili's so my expectations weren't real high.  The service was great for us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20
Rachel K.,"Naples, FL",93,85,66,2.0,10/14/2015,"I haven't been to a Chili's in years, and my visit to this one reminded me why. My entire family decided to have lunch there this past Sunday. There were 8 of us. We started with a couple rounds of happy hour 2 for 1 drinks. The Bloody Mary's were fabulous! Next up, appetizers ... Chips and salsa, DELICIOUS southwestern eggrolls, and the best darn fried pickles I've ever tasted. Then, our meals came ... *BARF!*. 3 of us ordered steak and chicken fajitas. The chicken wasn't fresh--it looked like a sliced McDonald's chicken patty. You could literally SEE its rubbery consistency. The steak was ... weird--I don't know how to describe it. (We were pretty disappointed, since Chili's is known for it's fajitas.) My mother-in-law ordered a turkey burger; they prepared her a beef burger. My sister-in-law ordered a sirloin, which was lacking juiciness and looked like it'd been previously frozen. After a couple bites, she gave up and decided to eat her broccoli instead, but it was undercooked and crunchy. She ended up sending her entire meal back for a refund. I give credit to the service, though. The manager personally came out to fix all of our problems, and immediately offered to take my mother-in-law's burger off our tab. The waitress was also good at keeping our drinks filled, and bringing anything we needed in a timely manner. I don't think I'll be going back to this, or any, Chili's unless it's for drinks and appetizers--and even THAT'S not enough to make me choose Chili's over somewhere else.

Jeff D.,"St Thomas, Canada",0,3,1,1.0,12/24/2015,"Very very poor...we frequent Chilli's all over in Michigan....and for the most part they're great! This one does not hit the mark. Too bad as we're on vacation and would like to go again. Bartender has no idea how to take care of customers. She had 4 guys in the one corner who had 95% of her attention. 3 pm and it took almost 10 minutes to get seated, in the bar area!!!??? Had to find utensils and wipes because the menu was very sticky, probably from margaritas... Waiter says he's been working double shifts for the last 4 days, not happy and now has an excuse for the poor service that awaits us. We should have left then but we persevered. Should have noticed the bar area full of empty glasses too. The food arrives and the waiter apologizes for the wait and tells us that the other chef left and is amazed that the remaining one is able to keep up (there's only 4 other tables occupied in the whole restaurant).  Glad I'm not the owner at this establishment. Stay away if you're going in for any food, unless you're there to kill time or are really bored.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20
Heath N.,"Naples, FL",0,39,3,1.0,1/15/2017,"Ordered to go online and was supposed to be ready 10 mins ago, in fact they were supposed to bring it out to me. I went inside, order is not ready, the girl looked at me and ran into the kitchen, this is stupid just standing here waiting for bad service. Won't be coming back. Don't waste your time ordering from here or have a sit down meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20
Erika D.,"Knoxville, TN",4,29,15,1.0,4/15/2015,This is the worse chili's I have ever been too! The service was super slow. I asked the gentleman that brought me our food to bring me the manager or my server and when the server came back his attitude changed quick. NOW LETS RECALLL THAT HE TOOK 35 mins to bring us a refill. He walked by Us multiple times before we stopped him.  This place needs help,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20
Evie L.,"Naples, FL",0,14,,2.0,4/28/2016,"Every time I've tried to enjoy it here the service is always terrible and the food tastes like it's loaded with salt. Expect your food to be extremely oily, wrong, salty, and gross. There was 4 of us and we waited an hour for the food, it wasn't busy, and one of the orders was wrong. We asked to just have the toppings that weren't on it to be brought out and waited 20 minutes, no one ever came over, and decided to just eat it without them. The wrong drinks were brought out, and when we asked for the ones we wanted the girl came back with them, didn't very apologize and gave a dirty look.  It's also pretty dirty and cold inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20

Joselyn R.,"Blue Ridge, GA",1,5,,1.0,4/5/2016,"I give this chilis a 1 star. I would be giving it no stars but I guess I have to give them one. I'll give them one for the great bacon burger I had this afternoon. But sadly this restaurant has lots to work on. First there should be a hostess standing at the front at all times. I saw people coming in and not being greeted and they stood there for minutes wondering if they should seat themselves or not. Not once did I see a manager walk by. The serving staff is very very slow and it took us 20 minutes to get our drinks in and for a server to realize we were sitting down. We were obviously ready to order when the server decided to show up. Horrible service the server did not deserve a tip at all. But since they live off them I couldn't be rude. Managers, start hiring people who care and make the restaurant a better one. This one sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20
Williamnkat A.,"Naples, FL",5,3,1,1.0,10/10/2015,"Horrible food, Fresh from our Freezer to your table. With bad service to boot. I am glad they put the auto payment tablets at the table so I don't have to talk to the rude server any longer. Only If they come back to the table.  And it makes giving a bad review that much easier along with a tip that Is commensurate of the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20

Robert C.,"Naples, FL",15,57,118,2.0,8/10/2014,"I don't know why we torture ourselves with the service here. My family and I like Chili's food and the staff is polite. The problem is no matter when we show up it takes forever; even just to order our drinks. They have ""partners"" which make you think their more efficient as a team. Not the case. It is a convenient location for me so I continue to stop in and frustrate myself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20
Jean C.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",97,36,170,3.0,9/22/2015,"Pretty average Chilis, close to the house so we come here when we don't want to travel far for food. The service isn't bad but it isn't great either. Waitresses sort of just laze around, and don't seem real enthused to be working. Service at the bar is usually pretty good, bartenders are usually real lively and can keep a convo going.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20
Dede S.,"Fort Myers, FL",15,17,23,1.0,5/5/2016,"I can't do a half a star so one is what it is. DO NOT come to this chili's location. On Cinco de mayo every restaurant in town was jam packed, so we decided to go to chili's because it's usually a safe bet. The restaurant wasn't crazy busy but you could tell they were short on waitresses. After a very VERY long wait we ordered drinks. An hour later (no exaggerating) the waitress came back to take our food order. An hour after our food still hasn't arrived at the table. Growing frustrated we called on the manager. She told us she'd take something off of our bill! We didn't come here for hand outs we came for a good meal and good company. By the time our food arrived we were full on chips. Our waitress was snippy saying she's doing all that she can. The restaurant is freezing. All in all, HORRIBLE experience and needs new management. Will be driving the extra distance to Gulf Coast Town Center Chili's from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20
Rachel I.,"Naples, FL",56,47,130,4.0,5/2/2014,"My most recent experiences at this location have pushed it back up to its original four stars. I believe the mix of tourist season and exhausted/lazy wait staff during the winter is what caused the wait to be even longer than the usual during season down here. Now that the snowbirds are gone, the service is faster with less crowds and happier and more lively staff as well. The food is good as always--the same quality you'll find at most locations of the chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples?start=20
Bill H.,"Naples, FL",37,409,36,2.0,8/15/2012,"It's your typical chain restaurant.  I tried the take-out a couple of weeks ago and the nachos were awful.  We decided to eat in the restaurant and give it another try.

Randy R.,"Carmel, IN",2,37,110,5.0,11/20/2012,"The food here is good. The interior design is very nice and comfortable. It's everything Applebee's wishes it was.
