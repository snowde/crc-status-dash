Ash K.,"Katy, TX",2,79,,2.0,8/7/2017,I usually have decent luck with Chili's but I will think again before I come to this location. I came around 5:45 PM and was seated promptly. There were hardly any guests at this time so I expected my food to be prepared quickly. While I was waiting I decided to go the restroom which was dingy and smelt like puke. My meal took around 20 minutes to come out which was unacceptable considering the amount of people inside the restaurant. I had the chicken crispers with corn which was on par with others Chili's i have visited. The only problem was that it  looked like someone took a bite out of my corn because there were two colonels missing from the center.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-natchitoches
Chantay M.,"Hammond, LA",12,31,15,1.0,9/30/2017,"Chili's is really getting worse. The hostess is also the buss boy. So needless to say ppl decided not to wait to be seated, they sat themselves. Waiter took forever to get our drink order. He was really nice tho. I suppose they can't find good help because they are in the heart of a college town.  Food was good. Temperature was fine. Do better chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-natchitoches
Miquel V.,"Lafayette, LA",166,4,,1.0,8/27/2016,Service is very lousy. Waited 10 minutes before our waitress came. Waited for 20 minutes for our water. Will never return again. And it wasn't even busy. They seemed to be cutting up in the kitchen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-natchitoches
Justin M.,"Coushatta, LA",0,9,3,1.0,5/29/2016,"We arrived at 14:30 and the first thing we noticed is there was not a hostess at the door. The restaurant was only half full and we had to wait to be seated because there was no hostess there to seat us! Once seated we placed our order. The waitress was very friendly and prompt. I ordered a full rack of ribs with the honey chipotle sauce with fries and southwest Mac and cheese and my wife ordered the triple play. We ordered my 2 year old chicken strips with mashed potatoes. We also ordered a appetizer of loaded boneless wings. The appetizer arrived first and it was very good but we were not given any small plates. Since the loaded boneless wings are served on a fajita skillet they stayed almost to hot to eat for a while. My 2 year olds food arrived next and he ate all the mashed potatoes and they were good as well j tastes everything before we give it to him. When the waitress brought out our food she immediately asked what sauce I had asked for. The wrong BBQ sauce was on the ribs and she knew it and apologized and said she would get me some more ribs but I told her it was okay and I would take the ones she brought. Upon tasting the ribs they had no flavor or salt to them at all they were very bland. The Mac and cheese was cold and I asked her to take that back and she did and brought another one. When the waitress brought us refills on drinks there was a thick white coat of grease on the inside of my glass. I stuck my finger in the drink and literally scraped what seemed like crisco off the inside of the glass. I showed my wife and we immediately stopped eating. I paid the check and left a tip on the screen at each table. I let the waitress know about the glass and told her we were leaving. She apologized for our experience. The place is very dirty inside and I posted a picture of what there bussed tables look like. I will never eat at this child's again, completely nasty and dirty and the sad part is a few years ago it used to be good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-natchitoches
Wendy B.,"Lena, LA",1,62,71,1.0,12/31/2014,"Tragic experience! I should have listened to Julee's review.  I came in for a quick snack and that was not going to happen. Even sat in the lounge so I would not have to wait for a table. I ordered water with lemon.  The sweetener was hard and clumpy and would not dissolve. Perhaps it had been wet before and dried??  Strike one. I then requested a cup of hot water and lemon to squelch the cold. They were extremely short handed like they had been the last two times I'd been in. I got water straight from the tap no lemon. Strike two. Appetizer was ok until I got to the ROTTING celery on my plate! Both ends were brown and wilted, even dehydrated! See pictures! Strike three! We were done. Won't be back for a while! Help needed here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-natchitoches
Annette F.,"Natchitoches, LA",0,14,,2.0,4/10/2016,"Tried going there around 3:30pm yesterday.There was no hostess.8 tables in the bar area alone weren't bussed.The bar itself was empty but wasn't bussed.We waited about 5min for even an acknowledgment for service for before leaving. Tip #1:Sit at the bar.You may not get faster service,but food is quicker than sitting at a booth or table. Tip #2:Order your appetizer first,than entree when they come back for your order.Every time an appetizer is ordered with my meal it always comes out with my meal,so my meal gets cold while eating the appetizer(even when I've specifically asked for it not to come out together). Just another terrible place is Natchitoches with terrible management and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-natchitoches
Lexi B.,"Kaneohe, HI",5,6,,1.0,1/5/2015,"TERRIBLE!!! This is the worst Chilis I have ever been to. The management is awful and the food is a sad excuse for bar food. The food comes out slow and tastes old and dry. It sucks that it's the only big chain restaurant in natchitoches. If you are looking for a good meal,  make the drive to alexandria or shreveport. Don't waste your money or time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-natchitoches
Billy L.,"Compton, CA",0,35,,4.0,7/8/2015,"The food quality at this location isn't any different from the other Chili's I visited in the past. I would definitely come back again the next time I'm in the area. Our server was friendly and polite, all of our dishes came out at once and we didn't have to wait too long. And the food tasted good. The restaurant was busy when I was there so I really appreciate how quick they were able to seat us, produce a good meal at a reasonable price and make us feel at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-natchitoches
Julee' W.,"Hot Springs, AR",4,15,9,1.0,6/23/2014,"Horrible experience! We should have known better when we walked in and saw 6 dirty tables, and the restaurant/bar wasn't that busy. We waited for the young lady to clean a table. She wiped everything off of the table onto the floor. At that point, we started to leave, but we didn't.  Our waiter was very personable.  He took our order and checked on us several times while we waited for our food.  I ordered the 3 item special (Mexican food), and I only received two of the items. My husband ordered a dry bacon burger, and it came with lots of mayo (which my husband will never eat). I had completed my meal by the time his food arrived.  It will definitely be a while before we come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-natchitoches
Leah M.,"Seattle, WA",10,30,49,1.0,10/5/2015,This chili's SUCKS! The only reason I ate here was it was free due to a gift card. If I had to pay with my own money there is no way you could convince me to go here. I ordered something you think would be simple to get right [sliders]. It was a sad excuse of food. The slider itself was ok the glazed onions alright the bacon was rubbery -_- to top it off they used processed yellow American cheese [that plastic stuff]. Apparently a multi million dollar corporation or maybe this establishment can't do right by their customers and place REAL CHEDDAR ON THEIR BURGERS. The service was alright clearly not trained in customer service because I told the waitress I needed more time and she just stood at our booth like a deer in headlights. She literally didn't move until I made a decision which was awkward. It sucks coming from a big city and having chains you can't even rely on. DONT WAIST UR PRECIOUS TIME HERE IT AINT WORTH IT. If I could give it zero stars trust me I would.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-natchitoches
