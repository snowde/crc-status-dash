Andy R.,"Lafayette, IN",13,138,234,3.0,12/18/2017,"A mixed bag of service, food, seating, and cleanliness. Overall it's decent and I classify this in the ""not a fancy destination but an acceptable alternative"" genre. On the good side, the food was hot and plentiful. Large menu with plenty of choices. The service was so-so. The expediter who delivered the food was game on, they quickly fixed a couple of mix ups (no sides for fajitas, no fries for another order). Good quantity and value with the meals we received.  My worst complaint is the seating, very cramped at the six-top tables on north side of restaurant. It's like they designed the space for booths, then realized there wasn't enough room, so jammed some tables in the same amount of space. We had to exit the chairs by frog-hopping single file. No room to stand up, slide chair in, and exit like normal. Another downer, the kitchen floor was a mess from spilled chips getting crushed in the busy kitchen entry/exit area. This location has some pleasant decorations using Noblesville High School jerseys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Cat J.,"Carmel, IN",51,41,46,2.0,11/11/2017,"There's something about this location...I have a hard time pinpointing what the problem is. Maybe it's the fact that the kitchen is loud and the workers are running into each other all over the place. Maybe it's the fact that it's like an ice chest in the restaurant. Maybe it's the fact that the server had no issue vigorously sweeping the floor literally inches away from my plate of food. Ugh. My husband enjoys the chips and salsa and their fajitas; if he didn't request it, I'd be fine not returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
James S.,"Noblesville, IN",7,46,9,2.0,10/2/2017,"Mediocre at best. Food was just ok. Order was wrong.  Ordered Cajun pasta, warmed over chicken, dried pasta, sprinkle of Cajun spice.  Wife ordered chicken over rice pilaf. Rice was under cooked and cool. Chicken was cold..broccoli was cool and what wasn't crunchy was over cooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Dale H.,"Fishers, IN",10,95,37,4.0,8/20/2017,"I stop in here Avery few weeks for dinner due to the wide variety of food on the menu so it's easy to stop in here with anyone so that everyone gets something they want. I often get the fajitas. They are very consistent with cooking every time I stop in. I have also had the BBQ burger here which is good as well as a wrap. The beer is cold, the staff is attentive and the restaurant is well kept. The only thing I don't like is the change of the silverware being dropped in a bag instead of wrapped in a napkin. (I know this sounds dumb but here is why) The problem with dropping my them in a bag means that once we take them out of the bag, there are multiple little bags laying on already cramped table space. It's just a small annoyance with the overall experience.  I highly recommend stopping in here for the variety of food available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Marcel C.,"Carmel, IN",75,14,1,5.0,12/9/2017,Great location and fast service. No complaints here. Food was great. I didn't order it but got to try a friends chicken and waffles there which I highly recommend. Interesting sauce they use on it which was delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Melissa S.,"Fishers, IN",20,2,1,2.0,8/15/2017,"We went to Chilis on a Saturday night. There weren't many people there but we still seemed to wait a long time for our food. The big shocker was the check- my significant other ordered fajitas- 3 strips of beef, some chunks of chicken and shrimp slightly larger than the size of a quarter and it cost $17.99. It also came with peppers and onions and usual toppings and tortillas but as I looked further at the receipt, we were charged another $1 for what was labeled as ""loaded fajitas."" This became a $19 meal for one person at Chilis. I could literally get a 16 oz prime rib meal with 2 sides and bread for $3 more at O'Charley's next door. My meal was a quesadilla made with an extremely hard tortilla. Our waitress brought the bill and I paid at the table electronically and we never saw her again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Nadia M.,"Tipton, IN",75,16,2,1.0,1/24/2017,"Came to Chili's today for lunch with my mom and we had a very poor experience. 1. Walked in and there was no one to be found, not a single employee greeted us and offered to seat us, so we went to the bar. 2. My mom went to the restroom and she said the moment she walked in, she saw smoke in the room as of someone had been smoking in there. She also said the bathroom was dirty and there was no toilet paper to be found! 3. The entire restaurant was dirty looking. Stuff on the floors, etc.  4. It took at least 5-7 minutes for us to be greeted by our server in the bar then he took our drink order, dropped off the drinks and was gone again for at least 15 min. We decided to leave after finishing our drinks and go to a different restaurant.  It was nowhere near busy in there and the last time we will ever visit Chilis. We've had problems at other locations too with food, etc. I do not recommend going here at any time during the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Linda M.,"Noblesville, IN",15,373,239,4.0,3/14/2015,"I decided to try some different menu items.  I ordered the fresh guacamole with chips and salsa and the skillet smoked chicken quesadilla with smoked potato wedges.  They were all excellent.  The chips seemed bottomless. My only concern or misunderstanding is that the server thought my points could only be added if I ordered carryout.  So now, I have to see about adding my visit to my reward program.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Maella P.,"Noblesville, IN",0,7,,1.0,9/19/2017,"Worst service ever! They forgot everything including silverware and straws, had to ask 3 times. Then they forgot my soup, then they forgot my sons pizza, then I asked for extra salsa and they forgot that!! Seriously how hard is it to take care of your customers? It wasn't even busy. I will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Jaime R.,"Noblesville, IN",4,9,46,3.0,4/10/2017,Ok for a quick lunch of they also have great specials throughout the week for dinner. It is decently priced and good place to go when you don't want to cook dinner. A lot of cellphone usage by staff though. The manger needs to find them something to do like clean.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Lori B.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/29/2017,"Their selection of music tells me they're must be trying to appeal to 14-16 year olds, but that age aren't the ones who have money to pay the prices they charge. This place needs to play music that doesn't get on people's nerves and make them want to leave quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Kay G.,"Strongsville, OH",4,14,1,1.0,6/28/2017,"Stopped in for lunch with my Dad. We were in before the noon rush, so they were not busy. Slow to be acknowledge on arrival, and no improvement through lunch. We received our food and first bite was cold. We waited a few minutes for our waitress to check with us. When that didn't happen I approached the two hostess and ask if they could get our server which they did. They microwaved our plates and dropped them off. It appears that the wait staff spends most of there time in the kitchen, which isn't goid for customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Matt H.,"Anderson, IN",171,116,5,3.0,10/28/2016,"The chili is always good.  Today i ordered the chicken bacon quesadilla.  It was decent, but not really good.  The best part of the meal is the chili and fries.  I question the value on some of the lunch menu items as the quality is just not there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Jason H.,"Noblesville, IN",6,44,129,3.0,3/31/2016,"Came here for lunch and it was OK.  The handshaken Margarita was excellent. However the lunch burrito, which is a smoked chicken burrito, was not impressive. At first glance it looks like it would have chicken all the way through. However after your first bite you realize that there is going to be no more chicken. This burrito was 95% rice and I don't recommend it. Only reason for three stars is that I have been here before and they have much more to offer. Very clean and the staff are very nice. Get you lunch menu together Chili's!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Dana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,136,20,3.0,4/6/2015,"Popped in here to get some dessert because I wanted a lava cake. Did you know that they've replace people with computers in Chili's now? I don't like it. I felt like I wasn't being served or being given any attention. All I wanted was a lava cake. I looked around and that kind of seemed to be the theme. A lot of customers were looking around waiting for waiters, and the waiters were just explaining how to order on the computer. WHAT IS THAT?! But. Once we got our pan brownies (we changed our minds on the lava cake)... it was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Will C.,"Noblesville, IN",0,8,1,1.0,11/29/2015,I got take out from chilies and they completely screwed up my order. I'm pissed! I ordered the original chicken tenders and I open the box and I see a few pieces of shit in my box (not literally) but it was crispy chicken tenders (not what I ordered) and it had honey barbecue all over it which made this chicken tenders look like shit. I didn't feel like driving back so I just sent my chicken tenders through the dishwasher.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Sue M.,"Carmel, IN",3,7,,2.0,9/24/2015,Not so good this time..just got soup and salad but soup arrived first and was not hot..a wait for the salad that had some wilted leaves... Usually a good menu,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Alyssa D.,"Bourbonnais, IL",88,29,26,5.0,8/18/2015,I see negative reviews for this Chili's but this is the friendliest location I have ever been to (and I've been to a lot of them). We walked up to the door and it was immediately opened for us by a guy and we were greeted by him. We walked up to the hostess station and the lady greeted us and was very friendly. She took us to our table and our waitress showed up quickly and was ALSO very friendly. A manager looking guy brought our appetizer out and also had a great vibe. Our food was great and then a different guy said thanks and bye on the way out! Loved the experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Sqirrl B.,"Noblesville, IN",7,69,119,3.0,8/14/2013,"Ate here last week on a whim. The place was packed, but the food was good and came out in a timely fashion. I had the habanero chicken, which lived up to its name. They didn't quibble about the shrimp thing either, just let the kitchen know. Over all, it was really nice, except for the digital ads kiosk sitting on each table. The things flashed ads at us throughout our entire dinner - not just ours, because we turned it away, but the ones on the other tables that other people had also turned away. The thing was so irritating, I gave this one a three star instead of the five they otherwise deserved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville
Amy E.,"Fortville, IN",50,11,1,1.0,3/12/2015,Came in on Thursday  night and my food was great  but the bartender  was awful rude acted like we bothered him when asked for anything.  Will walk out and not stay if I see him behind  the bar next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville

Blake C.,"Indianapolis, IN",149,8,,4.0,10/16/2015,I always find something at chili's that is good. I had the chicken and beef tacos tonight and they were great. They were loaded with chicken and toppings. Service was great as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville?start=20
Nicole B.,"Greenville, SC",6,18,6,4.0,2/23/2010,Thank you for keeping background music just that. Even though we sat directly under speakers it was easy listening and low enough that we could have table conversation with ease.  Server was able to accomodate an item no longer on the menu and was prompt with refills.  Very pleased with our visit today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville?start=20
Mike T.,"Noblesville, IN",11,28,2,4.0,2/18/2010,"Nice selection of enterees, reasonable prices, pretty good service. Not a place for health nuts, lots of fried food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville?start=20
Cody S.,"Noblesville, IN",7,2,,2.0,8/29/2012,"Went with family. I was the only one getting an alcoholic drink, the Tropical Sunrise, which is an awesome margarita. Waitress asked for ID and then told me she can't verify it was a legal ID and had to take it with her. That was very embarrassing in front of my family to do. I was about to just go home and show them my birth certificate. The ID itself has no bad markings on it and it isn't falling apart. It's mostly brand new.  The chips and salsa we got as an appetizer was stale and tasted bad. We know they can do better than this. About everything else was about as bland. I won't be coming back to this chilis anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville?start=20
Tim W.,"Indianapolis, IN",46,164,78,3.0,2/25/2011,"Chili's is my favorite comfort food spots. I know it's a chain, but when I find something I like on the menu, it's usually well-made at any Chili's. My current favorite is the Southern Fried Steak.  The large portions are definitely satisfying as is the spicy seasoned gravy. The queso and chips are a great appetizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville?start=20
Harrison P.,"Noblesville, IN",428,33,19,3.0,7/2/2010,"Average chain restaurant food. Nothing to get excited about, but not bad either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-noblesville?start=20
