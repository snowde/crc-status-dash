Evie B.,"Livonia, MI",202,407,51,3.0,10/31/2015,"I've always thought child's was one of the better chain restaurants- the service was great- not too busy n a Halloween early eve picked u as we were leaving- I had the tortilla soup and explosion Santa Fe salad - the soup when as good as I've had at other chilis The salad was great, but the cheesy tortilla that came with it was lame- Bloody Mary was ok...didn't inc. pickle like other chilis. Bottomless chips and salsa were good but first round of chips were just the crushed bits with a few full chips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20

James M.,"Newport, MI",57,709,347,3.0,7/28/2015,"This was the first Chili's location I ever tried. That was nearly 20 years ago.

Mike D.,"Novi, MI",0,12,,1.0,5/6/2016,It's a Friday nite and this place is empty.  After being seated and ordering I understand. Slow food prep and food served not as ordered.   Don't bother with location. Sad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20
Ernie M.,"Northville, MI",42,396,58,3.0,3/28/2015,"I had not been to  Chili's for years, but when  I met some friends here for a change, I was pleasantly surprised by the current menu.  I was not very hungry and saw the option of south west pair two (could have also had three) and I got two excellent tacos---one soft and one crispy and they were both great. The avocados  on each were fresh and tasty. The whole thing was only eight bucks. I'll go to Chili's more often now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20
Tom F.,"Farmington, MI",964,419,152,3.0,11/17/2013,"The Chain Gang! This is our later evening gotta have dinner in the mood for a steak what are you in the mood for place.  Had the the sirloin MW, loaded mashed potatoes, and corn on the cob. The sirloin was well prepared and had the nice seasoned taste. The meal is what I have always come to expect from a middle of the road, reasonable priced, eatery. The service was outstanding as they returned often, filled everything, and smiled. Very good customer service that I have come to epect. Like Liz R. I was tempted to give them four stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20
Dawn H.,"Northville, MI",87,1,,1.0,6/5/2016,"I have given this location multiple opportunities to change my opinion of the service and quality of food. It is in such a great location and has lots of potential. My last experience sealed the deal. We will not be returning. It's a Saturday night at 730 pm. There are more unbussed empty tables than there are occupied ones and still a 5 minute wait to be seated. When taken to our section we see that this side of the resturant is completely empty and tables are ready for customers, so we are unclear on the reason for the wait. Then there was the headache when using the rewards points. The issue was eventually resolved but the server made it clear that the manager was making an exception. We had ordered the white queso dip and chili con queso dip was what was delivered to our table. At best it was comparable to dog food. I had to show the server the photo that was displayed on the rewards offer for understand what I was talking about. Everything about this visit was awful. Our salad came out before the appetizer. Then when the correct appetizer came it was literally 45 seconds until our main course was delivered. Our table was so full of plates that it was hard to eat in a comfortable manner. Lastly, the server was pretty much ushering us out I had to remind her that we had ordered dessert with our meal. That was another 8 minute wait. What a poor example of a Chili's resturant.  I'm surprised they are still in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20
Lynn H.,"Northville, MI",312,514,291,2.0,3/16/2013,"It's been a while since I've been to Chili's.  And it will probably be a while before I go back again.  I just don't like their menu.  While other chains like Ruby Tuesday and Applebees have revamped their menus to feature an extensive selection of healthy foods, Chili's has given a week nod to healthy food and still primarily features the same ol' artery-clogging Tex-Mex that they've been serving up for decades. Couple the old menu with slow service and you come up with... Meh.  I've experienced better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20
Dan R.,"Canton, MI",0,12,,1.0,5/15/2016,"Worst Chilis in the area, and that is saying something.  Slow service, average food, not clean.  Tried it 3x, I'm out.  Best of luck to you.

Russell S.,"Beavercreek, OH",52,112,18,2.0,8/17/2014,"Good food and good service. The patron margarita is the bomb! The expensive types of food like steak and such is not very good here but if you stick to burgers, chicken tenders, salads, etc you will enjoy it. Edit: wrote this review before I paid the bill. They have portable iPad type ziosk on the table and you are able to pay the bill which is cool but it was out of paper. Had to wait fifteen minutes to get the receipt.

Liz R.,"Livonia, MI",299,742,880,3.0,1/9/2011,"Yes, we did Chili's... and I was tempted to give them 4 stars.  So there! We got a $25 gift card for Christmas (sigh), and it didn't sound hideous to either of us tonight, so we thought 'what the heck?'. They're running a two for $20 special which equates to two $10 entrees and a free appetizer.  Started with the roasted corn guacamole.  Not bad!  Large-ish bowl, served with tortilla chips and a similar sized bowl of their delicious smoky salsa. I ordered the Chicken Crispers for my entree.  Five crispy, juicy fingers served with ranch and BBQ dipping sauces, plus an ear of corn (which tasted good and not defrosted) and cinnamon apples instead of fries.  Ken had the half rack of baby back ribs with mashed potatoes.  He ordered them Memphis dry rubbed but got regular BBQ.  Our waiter immediately put in an order for the correct dish and left the ribs for us to eat.  I know they'd just toss them, but it was nice to have such quick service to rectify. With Ken's beer our bill came to a bit over $25.  Not a bad meal for the $7 we kicked in to cover the overage and tip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20
Deanna M.,"New Hudson, MI",42,6,3,1.0,3/7/2016,"Not pleased with service or food! Ordered a appetizer which was queso spinach dip before ordering entrees, waited 15 minutes for a appetizer that should have taken   5 -8 minutes tops, your putting chips on a plate and heating the cheese sauce.The server should have been checking to ensure it was being made or ready but not until my pop was sitting empty along with the chips and runny salsa did she bother to check on our appetizer. So we get the appetizer it's ok and within 5- 8 minutes are food arrived, so we didn't finish the appetizer, and you could tell they held our food in the kitchen because my skillet meal was not sizzling like other skillet meals around me and the chicken meal was barley luke warm! My sirloin was chewy and tough, but I guess I should have known better then to order a steak at a Chili's...It was obvious they had our  meals ready right after finally getting our appetizer and had to hold the food so it didn't come out within minutes of the app. The server should be more attentive to her guests food order, and when I ordered I mentioned 2x what size steak I wanted and after she walked away she came back and asked me again ( which makes 3x now) what size steak to ""just make sure"" I guess the 2x I told her was not enough. All in all it was not an enjoyable meal and service is mediocre at best, considering the server doesn't even take the payments, they have their guests pay their bills which wouldn't bother me if the server was doing a better job and was more engaged in making sure her timing and the foods timing was done appropriately.  Disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20

Jenny K.,"Detroit, MI",311,195,2139,3.0,2/20/2014,"My husband and I tried this place before our movie started at AMC 20 down the street, during happy hour. Upon walking in, I was greeted by a gentleman who later turned out to be our waiter. His name was Harold; he was very nice and attentive and seated us right away at the bar. I ordered a frozen Strawberry Margarita to start, per Harold's recommendation. It was so good! My hubby ordered his Blue Moon and we sipped away waiting for our food. It took a little longer than normal to get our food out. For the sake of picking out something quick and of minimal options to choose from, we did the 2 for $20 deal which included one appetizer and 2 entrees. It seemed a bit rushed once Harold realized we both finished our beverages and nothing had come out yet.  When our appetizer finally did come out, our food came out 2 minutes later. I have to say...I hate that. There is no point in ordering an appetizer when this happens because all you'll want to eat is your actual meal. We ordered the fried cheese as our appetizer, which is 7 mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce. I love these in general, but these were ok and a ""safe"" option. They came out semi-warm, which indicated they had been ready for a bit before being brought out. I ordered the chicken fajitas for my entree and my hubby ordered the honey chicken crispers. The fajitas came out sizzling, as they should, and tasted good. The tortillas were soft and warm; everything tasted fresh. My husband enjoyed his crispers as well. They came with homestyle fries and a corn on the cob. They reminded me of the honey BBQ boneless wings from BDubs. Everything tasted very good and came out fresh. Overall, I liked our meal and enjoyed our quick stop in there. I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would hope to go at a time when it wasn't so busy. Our waiter was really trying his best to accommodate us but was given too many tables all over the place. Worth a try if you're in the area; you can't beat getting 2 decent meals and an appetizer for $20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi?start=20

Nikki M.,"Salem, MI",18,130,,2.0,11/27/2010,"I have experienced better, yes but this chili's is the most convenient so I know to expect less then 100% service but still it's a bummer.  If you get carry out you have to be careful cause they will burn things or give you tortilla chips that aren't cooked all the way, cause most people aren't going to want to drive back up there and then wait for new food. The other bad thing with their carry out is they often say 20 minutes and really its about 45minutes so if you are in a hurry order way ahead or you'll be running late. Service inside is okay, the 2 for $20 promo is nice and they do have coupons on their website, something different day of the week, I think monday is free chips and salsa day...

Ann W.,"Northville, MI",63,299,984,3.0,12/7/2017,"I'll admit it. I'm highly suggestible so when I heard Jay and Allyson of WNIC raving about Chili's nachos and fajitas on-air earlier on in the day, I knew that I had to make it there. Timing was perfect since I was doing a 'Target Run' nearby.  The tableside guac was substantial, two whole avocados mashed but chunky, the way I like it, with cilantro, diced red tomatoes, and onions. I asked the server to leave out the jalapeno disks so the end result was a bit flat until I added the salsa. The tostada chips were outstanding, extra thin, light, salty, and warm. They were fragile, to be sure, so scooping out the guacamole was a no go and instead, it was more about spooning it onto the chip. I also had the shrimp and steak fajitas combo that was more onions and peppers than anything else. As always, the portion was huge so there was more than enough for dinner the following evening. Service was friendly and relatively quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi

Our waitress was nice but very absent. Had to run her down to cash out.  Crispy asparagus?  Don't. It's gross. Just don't. Overlooked to hell and a waste of money.  Had grilled chicken.

Jeff W.,"Novi, MI",90,199,56,1.0,4/29/2016,"We should have read many of the recent reviews before stopping in here.  It seems like this place has been on a steady decline in service and quality.   To be honest, we usually come here once a year as the food is just mediocre, but the 2 for $20 is a pretty good deal.  Their advertisement for the prime rib fajita intrigued me, so we stopped in.  We found ourselves in the lobby with another couple.  We stood there as server after server walked right by.  After about 5 minutes a large party came in behind us.  It was now getting terribly awkward as the lobby was filled with guests, but no one showed up.  Quite a few minutes later, a host finally showed up, but we were already on our way out the door. My wife was upset that a place would have such a slow reaction time on a Saturday at 2:00 pm.  She called the location to speak to a manager, but it rang and rang and rang without a response.  She immediately went to their website and left a comment, email and phone number on the feedback website.  Over a week later and there was zero response.   We are not terribly concerned that this place has been crossed off our list of restaurants to visit.  Chili's doesn't really do anything better than any of the other chains.  On the Border is in the same area and does everything Mexican better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi

Scott O.,"Novi, MI",0,62,13,3.0,10/22/2015,"Improved since we were last here a year ago. Service was polite and efficient. Food very good. Salad, chips and fajita all fresh and well presented.  The tabletop kiosk for reordering drinks and paying is an awesome innovation. Easy to use too. Only issue was a couple fruit flys. And we were a distance from the bar too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi
Kelli H.,"Hershey, PA",1,1,1,2.0,1/7/2017,"Seriously unhappy with my experience. Had to send the ribs back twice because they were cold. Then manager acted like he didn't believe us because ""they temp'd the meat in the kitchen.""  Just awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi
Magnus L.,"Denton, TX",95,603,258,3.0,3/8/2014,"Chili's is pretty consistent typically. This location is pretty decent, on the particular day we went it was just cold inside the restaurant and it didn't help that we sat close to the togo door even though no one came that early to get anything to go. We had the skillet queso which was good, thick the way I like it. I prefer Chili's queso to the ""cheese sauce"" they serve at the ""mexican"" restaurants in the area. We came for lunch and I wanted something lighter and I finally tried their ""Lighter Choices"" menu. Their mango-chili chicken was really awesome! Less than 600 calories but still had a ton of flavor. They have free wifi and unlike many restaurants their wifi actually works!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-novi
