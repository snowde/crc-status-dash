Beth H.,"Amaron, Midland, TX",14,3,,4.0,10/5/2017,"The food was great, me and my husband both loved it. Unfortunately I'm cursed since I started serving and never get good service. She forgot something every trip to the table. However, I'm reviwing the restaurant not her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Sylvia R.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/28/2017,"The worst customer service, starting with the hostess and the supposed manager.  The establishment did not want to seat us because we were too big of a party so they made the excuse of an hour wait when when we could see there was seating available and they sat 10 people after us.  Former resident of Odessa--- and I can say this Chili's has always lacked in the department of customer service. Even after giving them opportunities by going back (not by my choice but other friends, family ( and even after renovations ) , they still can't get it right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Jessica P.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,5,,1.0,12/27/2016,"Stay away ! This is by far the worst chilis I have eaten at. My husband ordered a water. The first one cup had a full bottom lip of lipstick on the rim . After sending the water back and getting his second cup it had lipstick in it as well & it was a different shade so I knew it was a different up.  The Margarita class that was given to me was chipped on the bottom . The edge was sharp enough to cut me.  I ordered fajitas for dinner , my onions and bell peppers weren't cooked . My chicken was cold & my shrimp were raw . This is by far the worst experience my family and I have ever had at a restaurant. Bad enough that I don't think we will ever eat at a chilis again.  After complaining to the manager nothing was really done . He took $6 off for the shrimp & could careless about our bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
D W.,"Whitney, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/20/2017,Will not go back took 45 min after the appetizer arrived to get our order I could understand if it was a difficult one but it was your fairly common chicken strips and fries and a order of 3 carnitas if that's what you want to call it tacos.. The kicker is all the good was warm at best !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Davin T.,"Antelope, CA",5,27,6,1.0,12/29/2016,"Not very clean...the bathrooms, the silverware, the glasses...even the table had a grimy film on it.  Our salt shaker was so crusty that nothing would even come out of it.  Service is pretty slow even if they're not busy.  Very loud, especially if you sit near the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Kevin C.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/3/2017,This place has seriously hit the skids. After checking in with their app and arriving I was told I was the third person in the queue. After several tables had been seated I was told I was still third. They were out of the first two items I ordered off the menu. It took 30 minutes to receive an appetizer. I shared the triple dipper with a friend and one of the two Big Mouth Bites that came with it did not have meat in it. Seriously! A tiny bun with no meat in it. The manager of this place really deserves the axe. This is mismanagement at its worst.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Jysette O.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/28/2017,"We drove for 6 hours to visit family and after a long day we decide to go eat we walk in at 9:20pm a total of 8 adults with 2 high chairs, I inform the hostess of how many and right away she made a ugly face and told me to hold on, I then saw her go speak to someone (manager) and I go inform her 4 more will be coming, then the manager herself made an ugly face and rolled her eyes. She then tells me it will be 45 minutes to an hour. I go let my family know of the horrible customer service and we sit there thinking of what to do, they proceed to sit 3 different groups (2 top, 3 top, & 5 top) we make a decision and decide to leave. I go let the hostess know and I ask for her manager, she then tells me that lady she was talking to was her, I reply ""the one who rolled her eyes"" she tells me oh she rolled her eyes, that's just how she is. The customer service was horrible, the hostess was rude, and so was the manager, no wonder the employees act like that, the manager is their example.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Kate H.,"Lewisville, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/6/2017,Walked up to the host stand and stood there for 4-5 minutes before the host acknowledged us. Then said she would be with us in a moment. Before that servers walked by and still nobody offered to seat us at a table. Ended up walking out and going to cheddars. Service is always terrible anyways,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Jim T.,"Katy, TX",1,50,17,1.0,5/5/2015,Slow! Slow! Slow! I even sat at the bar thinking it would speed up the service on a Tuesday night. I only ordered a salad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
S S.,"Odessa, TX",0,31,32,2.0,6/1/2015,"My family went to chili's for dinner and what a disappointment. The staff was attentive and friendly the food was very attractive. However, the wings were so salty when my husband picked them up salt just cascaded down to the plate. He had to remove the skin in order to eat them. The salmon was dry and the broccoli undercooked. The celery had brown spots all over them! This was a dissapointing dinner. We also waited almost an hour to receive our food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Cindy C.,"Overland Park, KS",4,5,,1.0,1/15/2015,"I would give 0 stars if I could. The restaurant floor was filthy. It took forever for someone to sweep the floor and clean dirty tables even though there were barely any customers. The lady sweeping the floor finally came around to cleaning the tables around us about an hour into our stay, blasting music extremely loudly from a radio in her butt pocket. All the waitresses and hostesses were practically shouting at each other across the room, talking about personal things.  Now the food...we ordered fajita and quesadilla and they were both just ok. In fact, they were fantastic compared to the atmosphere in the restaurant.  The bathroom was disgusting and obviously no one cleans it or anything. Two of the stalls were locked from the inside even though nobody was in there. One just had water flushing like mad for a long time, and the last one was filthy. I decided to just hold myself for the entire 2-hour duration, which was miserable.  The only good thing about the experience was our waiter, who was the only one doing his job right. Don't go here if you can help it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Tony H.,"Tucson, AZ",4,43,18,1.0,9/6/2015,Not impressed with this Chili's.  The bar tender was really off his game.  He forgot to give everyone napkins and utensils. Bar was so dirty.  Dirty dishes everywhere.  No manager in site.  Menus were super greasy. Boulder even hold them.  Feel like I need hand sanitizer.  Not that great of a dining experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
FrankyRosie H.,"Andrews, TX",20,1,,1.0,12/23/2015,"Haven't eat here in a while. Waited 15 minutes before the waiter came to get our drinks order. Then they took another 30 minutes to take our food order. I came here to eat their chicken fried steak, but was very disappointed that they did not offer it anymore. So I ordered the half rack and sirloin then they tell me they're out of ribs. Really this is a place where ribs are there specialty. This is the last time I eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Lauryn H.,"Odessa, TX",91,27,10,3.0,8/19/2015,"Always hit or miss :/ Has one of my favorite dishes but I'm always disappointed with the cleanliness of the restaurant. For me, the food can be delicious but my surroundings have to be clean! This last time we sat next to a window and there was a dead fly in the window seal and 2 flies pestering during our meal. (Which I understand sometimes that is out of their control). Overall... Good food but cold use a deep clean!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Simi J.,"Garland, TX",44,82,8,1.0,12/5/2013,"This restaurant is absolutely horrid. We ordered the Fajita Trio and Spinach dip from Chili's to go... sadly, the chips were the best thing we got- and even those were incredibly salty. Ugh... I've never been so annoyed. Here's my problem: 1) The shrimp in our fajita trio was raw... like literally defrosted and plopped into our to go box. 2) After grilling the shrimp on our own and heating up the meat again, it still tasted sub-par. Meh. Overall, it just added to our oh-so-wonderful Odessa food experience. -____-",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Scott G.,"Washington, DC",0,48,4,2.0,8/26/2013,Slow service. Dirty restaurant. Same menu as any Chillis. Place is only in business because Odessa is booming and there are more customers than restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Arman T.,"Lewisville, TX",0,12,,1.0,8/25/2015,"We went to this Chili's for Lunch. This place is dirty. The tables, floors, bathrooms are filthy. Please do not go there. This place deserves a -10 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Justine H.,"Odessa, TX",1,15,2,4.0,4/6/2015,It's been really hit or miss with this place. The long waits can be discouraging. The food is the same as every other chili's although sometimes here it's already cold when you get it. We have had pretty decent service most of the time. The kiosks they keep at the table are entertaining for the kids when they are working. It was the manager that really stood out to me. After my wallet fell out of the diaper bag she held on to it for me and returned it which was a great relief.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Jessica A.,"Minneapolis, MN",1199,710,870,2.0,8/18/2010,"What was I thinking? It was a long day, and after a delayed flight into MAF (Midland airport) I just wanted something to eat and at 10pm my choices were extremely limited.  I won't bore you with a long, detailed review of the poor service I received... or the fact that the server kept rolling her eyes at me, because she brought me the wrong entree....or that the friendly manager tried to correct the situation by bringing me a complimentary small dessert (which i really didn't need or want at 10:30pm), and then no one delivered.  I'll just say that you know what kind of food you're getting here -- it's Chili's. It's a chain... they have the same menu as every other Chili's in the world. The food was the same as every other one... just alright. But tonight, the service was a thumbs down. Is it really that hard to refill coffee? Sorry! (and now I'm rolling my eyes) And if Chili's truly is the ""best restaurant/bar & grill in Odessa"" per jamielee d's review -- yikes!...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Yessenia E.,"Odessa, TX",28,93,185,3.0,8/9/2014,Is like any other chillis but the only thing I dont u like about this chillis there staff is slow beside that is good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4
Isbach S.,"Odessa, TX",2,10,1,4.0,11/13/2014,"Good service , good food. I had the shrimp tacos and I have to say they were pretty good for being this place.  We also ordered the crispy chicken kids meal, also good, and their table tablets keep the kids occupied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4?start=20
Bert G.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,51,35,1.0,6/7/2012,"Consistency in a restaurant is a good thing when you find it. When you travel it is especially a good thing. This is the most inconsistent Chili's I have ever been in. Floor was nasty when we walked in - trash everywhere. We chose open seating in the bar and it was a long time before we got anyone to talk to us about what we wanted to drink, or, eat. When I travel I try to stick to known places and meals - I have had the Monterrey Chicken all across the Chili's chain and this was the worst I have ever seen it. My advice is to skip this one - as I will do next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4?start=20
Mona B.,"Odessa, TX",33,6,,4.0,9/29/2015,"We decided to give Chili's another try and have been there to eat three times in a couple of weeks. First thing that was noticeable is that the staff seems to have entirely changed. The servers are definitely more professional and friendlier.  The restaurant is cleaner. Our food arrived in a timely manner and was consecutively better in the last three visits. So thankful that someone, whomever it was, realized that there needed to be some big changes made and made them.  Giving a 4 star for now. Hoping to be able to give a 5 in a few weeks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4?start=20
Allen U.,"Odessa, TX",10,175,580,3.0,7/2/2014,"Great weekday joint for happy hour, not too crowded except on weekends, good luck trying to get good service or food for that matter. I made a visit to my local Chili's recently because I wanted to go socialize with friends and what better way than meeting at Chili's. I arrived around 5:30pm and we were seated quickly to my surprise but yet again it was on a Tuesday. Our waitress was rather friendly and catered our needs in a timely manner, chips and salsa were good however by the time our entrees arrived we went through two servings of chips and salsa. My chicken crispers were a bit dry so I dipped them all in honey mustard as much as I could for better flavoring, the fries were also cooked to a crisp and corn on the cob not too bad. Overall it was ok for a Chili's, it didn't wow me like Chili's had back in the early 2000s or 90s when it first opened. The 3 stars is mostly because our waitress did an excellent job even though I waited for a refill once and took about 20 minutes for her to get our ticket, good thing the Cinnamon Molten Cake kept me occupied otherwise I might have had to go fetch her. Food was ok, service was ok, OK for your social gatherings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4?start=20
Greg M.,"Odessa, TX",1,16,7,1.0,9/11/2015,Okay 5 minutes in an almost empty place.  Another 10 to gat a can of beer.  Ordered steak which I think is the worst cut of meat.  Potatoes okay.  3rd worst meal.  Good method to pay and get out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4?start=20
Jim D.,"Odessa, TX",12,21,7,4.0,6/15/2014,"Coming here on Father's Day looked to be a mistake but turned out pretty decent. We decided to eat at the bar and the bartender was one of the best I've ever seen (customer service wise). Everything came out pretty quick, the drinks were made to perfection and everything tasted as good as you'd expect from a chili's. Not a bad place to stop for a Sunday dinner and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4?start=20

Tamara C.,"Hamilton, TX",6,5,,1.0,10/15/2014,"I have never really had a bad experience at Chili's until tonight. This was my first time at this location and will never be back. They had a wait but we were seated pretty quickly since it was just my husband and me. After we got our drinks everything went down hill. It took our waitress 15 mins to come back and get our order, we got a 1/2 order of cheese fries and I got a salad with my meal. It took almost another 15 mins for the fries and 5ish mins after that to get my salad. We then waited another 45 mins for our food. We didn't even get our food until we had asked for a manager (who never ever bothered to show up.) Our waitress (who maybe came to check on us 3 times the entire time we waited) proceeded to tell us the kitchen had gotten back up which is why our food took so long, mind you 1/3 of the place was empty. To top it off my husbands beef fajitas were burnt and my grilled chicken was super dry. I have always really liked Chili's it's pretty much our go to place to eat, but we will never go back to this location!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-odessa-4?start=20

Danny R.,"Odessa, TX",0,17,,4.0,7/29/2011,"I'm surprised to see so many low reviews. Could be i just got lucky, but i have a nice time here.

Marie L.,"Odessa, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/30/2014,"Heard this Chilis had new manager, so decided to give it another try. Bad idea.  Sunday lunch time. One of us ordered soup for her meal. It came 15 minutes ahead of the rest of our food. I ordered shrimp tacos. Shrimp and rice cold. Sent it back. Got it back with shrimp still cold. My husband ordered chicken crispers.  Hot on the outside but not on the inside. Gross. No sign of a manager. Glass between bar and other dining area smeared with something.

Mac G.,"Green Valley, AZ",0,1,,2.0,3/29/2012,Understaffed. We arrived just before 1 pm and found several waiting. Since there were several clean and empty tables we assumed it was a large group.
