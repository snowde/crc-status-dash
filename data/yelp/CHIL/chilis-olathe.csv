Todd B.,"Power & Light District, Kansas City, MO",0,11,3,4.0,8/15/2017,Just another Chili's not sure how this location is still open. The place is almost empty. Good service and food. Just get a little creepy when you are one of four tables.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Susan B.,"Leawood, KS",29,77,66,1.0,12/11/2017,Okay so they asked me to call them and explain what happened on our horrible visit. They then proceeded to send me two $10 gift certificates after I wasted $70 and wasted almost two hours. No thanks Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Autumn G.,"Kansas City, KS",0,2,3,1.0,12/6/2017,"It was pretty gross. Definitely the worst chilis I've ever been in. The table we sat at (booth closest to the door in bar area) was pretty gnarly. The window had a bunch of splatters on it, it was super dusty, looked like it hadn't been wiped down in ages. The women's bathroom was gnarly too.  FYI, not writing this to be mean. I love Chilis but the GM here needs some better staff members or be better at their job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Calico S.,"Olathe, KS",72,17,40,1.0,8/1/2017,This was one of my worst restaurant visits that I've ever had.  It started from my greeting at the door by the hostess.  She had to ask me to have a seat while she cleaned my table off.  Then it took 15 minutes for someone to come to my table to take my drink order.  Then another 7 minutes for my drinks to come out.  I wanted to order an item from the happy hour menu but because it took so long to come back over to my table to take my order Happy Hour was over by 15 minutes.  Then my server walked away and didn't come back for another 18 minutes.  By this time I asked to be cashed out.  As I'm sitting and waiting for my check to appear on the kiosk I was informed that he forgot to send it.  So needless to say I spent 45 minutes of my life waiting for service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Deb G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",59,531,66,4.0,12/22/2016,"In an area with very few restaurant options, I was pleased to find this Chili's does an excellent job on their original buffalo chicken sandwich and fries.   The sandwich was prepared well and tasted like their old school style; and the fries were some of the best I've had in a while.  I also ordered an Appletini and it was fair; not quite the real thing, but still good.  The wait staff was also very friendly and provided good service.  Really glad the sandwich was so good; I went in looking forward to that dish and I was not disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Linda D.,"St. Louis, MO",0,2,,5.0,5/5/2017,This chili's has a remarkable general manager. ..makes the experience just great!  The food is really better than most all texmex and mexican restaurants. ..the margs are superior.  Highly recommended! !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Sydney S.,"Olathe, KS",18,45,35,5.0,8/15/2016,"Ordered carryout last night, since we were at the hospital across the street with my grandma.  We ordered a couple orders of the Southwest Egg Rolls and the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. The girl who took our order was very friendly and thorough.  The food was ready when they said it would be. The manager also had the egg rolls cut for us, like they are served in the restaurant, even though they are served whole when togo.  Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was hot and delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Don E.,"Salina, KS",4,199,8,4.0,4/1/2016,"Very busy. Service for our bunch was good. Only had to ask for water once. Salads, bacon cheeseburger and smothered chicken burrito were above average. Although a typical Chilis, would go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Tricia S.,"Olathe, KS",0,1,,2.0,9/5/2014,"Wait time was ridiculous... Not to busy, the hostess was not trained very well... She'll take your name but won't remember... Once seated the wait staff are impossible to get great service.. I would pass this location at all cost this isn't the first time of terrible service here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
C L.,"Olathe, KS",19,160,7,3.0,4/28/2011,"I really want to give Chili's 2 stars, but I'm not going to do that. They didn't do anything wrong aside from being a part of a chain. That said, I hate Chili's. But we went because my child wanted to partake in a ""Major Saver"" deal - those punchcard coupon thingies that kids sell for their schools.  1. It ended up not being a deal at all  2. The thought that I spent $35 at Chili's makes me want to vomit  3. Even so, my son enjoyed his 12oz ribeye ""w/ carne asada rub"", medium-rare, and I also thought it was well-flavored  4. How could I have forgotten that their nachos (getting an app was part of the deal) are terrible?  5. At least the server was nice  6. Remember not to buy a Major Saver card again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Bryan T.,"Gardner, KS",18,16,2,4.0,3/29/2013,This particular Chili's always has quick service and low wait times even on Friday night.  The staff is always friendly and the store is clean.  This is one of the better Chili's we have around.  The food is just like every other Chili's.  I will say if you've never had the Salmon... try it.  It's delicious!  Always tender and tasty. And I highly recommend starting off your meal with some Skillet Queso.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Jacque T.,"Gardner, KS",20,5,1,1.0,10/17/2013,"do not waste your money or time!!! food was cold, service was not good at all!!! yuck! :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
Dan M.,"Sheboygan, WI",0,2,,4.0,12/20/2010,Chili's is Chili's.  A national chain serving casual dining fare with a texmex flair.  I've never gotten a bad meal here.  Usually get burgers but chicken strips are great also.  Did you know you could request different kinds of batter?  I have always liked their ribs.  I know that's a bad word in KC but their ribs are reliable good. Although I get a little confused over the six different kind of sauces available.  I'm loving the current promotion of an appetizer and two entres for $20.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe
