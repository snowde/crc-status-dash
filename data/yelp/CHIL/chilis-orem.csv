Peter K.,"Provo, UT",5,42,60,3.0,7/21/2017,"I'm giving this Chili's establishment three stars.  First off I ordered my food online through the chilis app. And I was told it would be half an hour wait. I didn't care because I knew it was busy especially being a weekend and late night. I ordered myself chicken strip with fries, and my sister got a vegan burger with a side of extra fries. The processes of ordering online was really easy and simple. You can even customize your order to how you want it!  When I got the text message that my food was ready. I made my way to chilis. I parked in the area where ""pick up only"". I made my way into the restaurant. I waited roughly 10 mins to be helped. You think if a worker saw you they would stop and ask if I've been helped? Nope that didn't happen. I had to ask and was told by the waiter he would come back with the person who was suppose to ring me up.  Finally after 20 mins of waiting they brought my food out and paid for it. When I got home and opened up the plates of food I ordered I was so shocked to find out that the extra side of fries that I ordered was so little. (Due to my sister eating the fries right away I couldn't take a picture.) But the amount of fries on the plate shouldn't be 5.00 extra!? It was my fault for not checking the plates of food.  Also another thing it's seems like all the co-workers didn't to care to work as a team, but rather state ""oh that's not my job!"" Their professionalism lacks big time. Ji would just rather go to another chilies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem
Richard H.,"Graham, WA",325,1203,2707,4.0,5/8/2017,"Had dinner here tonight, and was very pleased with it, we got the 2 for $22 special they had, soI went with a Chili, which was very good, and for the entree went with a Mango-Chile Tilapia  - which was spicier than I like it, but still pretty good! I went with the local Hefeweizen option they had also. My wife went with the Nacho's (the sauce with it was very good!) and she got the Margarita Grilled Chicken (I think) which the chicken was very tender! And for drink a Watermelon Margarita. I would most certainly come back to a Chilis and would recommend this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem

Shayla G.,"Oxnard, CA",59,12,8,2.0,12/27/2017,"It's been a few years since I've came to chili's and it wasn't all that great.. I was so excited to try the street corn and it didn't taste like street corn at all, they used a Cajun spice on top and added lime, not to mention the corn was so soggy. It just really didn't taste good. And they were out of about 3 different dishes so I finally had to settle for a sandwich that was mediocre, I'll only come back for beers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem
Brady E.,"Provo, UT",376,87,21,4.0,6/9/2017,"Crowded (which is usually a good indicator). Fast order-to-eat time (always good). Delicious food (you'd hope so).

Still, good place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem
Aubrey U.,"Orem, UT",0,2,4,1.0,1/1/2018,"I wanted to order to go, so I went online and every time I tried adding an item to my cart, it would crash on me and say my session expired and reload the page. I did this twice before giving up and downloading the mobile app.... which did the exact same thing to me. I finally decided to call in my order. It was ready on time, the girl who rung me up was friendly. But I get home and there is a plethora of problems with my order. My burgers have no mayonnaise (when I ordered and paid for extra). I ordered beef nachos (which were about 5 dollars more than regular bachos), NO BEEF. And I didn't get my side of pico with them either. The only part they got correct was my mashed potatoes. So I paid $9 for literally 6 chips with cheese which I could have just as easily done myself. Not to mention 40% of the cheese on them is burned to a crisp so it's going straight into the trash. Awful to go service, would NEVER do it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem

Brett B.,"Provo, UT",0,4,,1.0,4/25/2017,"Had dinner tonight.  It might be a stretch to say that we saw our waiter twice.  On the menu in big bold letters it says CRISPY CHICKEN. It was soggy...and cold.  The mexican bowl was small and way over priced and the southwestern salad had twice the dressing it should've had.  Since we never saw our waiter we couldn't tell him. Finally, after waiting way too long we paid and left. Our waiter beat us out of the door as he must have gone home.  We won't have to worry about this again as we're done. Won't be back. It seems as though Chili's might have changed ownership because what was once a great place is now pretty average (as measured by our last 4 experiences).  Don't waste your time or your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem
Sara P.,"Provo, UT",239,233,88,3.0,5/31/2016,"I came here with my in laws and some family from out of town on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch. The wait staff was pretty cool! Everyone has personality here, I love that. It doesn't feel so ""corporate"" when the staff is chill. The food was pretty good, if you love spicy, try their chipotle ribs! Appetizers were delicious and hot. Our food came out about 10 minutes later! Not bad for a table of 7!

Ryan H.,"Provo, UT",1,6,1,1.0,7/3/2017,"K this has happened several times this restaurant, and the entire franchise- they're literally horrible. Somehow the bread sandwiches were soggy (3 sandwiches- all the same kind). Then, they made the burgers taste like fish and the ones that didn't taste like fish tasted like saw dust. After taking 3 bites 3 of us were forced to send the burgers back while not asking for another. Needless to say most of us went home hungry. Following, my ribs barely had any meat on them and zero flavor. The food was expensive, and gross if possible I'd give it zero stars- to anyone who is thinking of dining here run, run as fast as you can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem
William K.,"Laie, HI",11,24,2,4.0,6/17/2017,"My wife and I go here about once a week. Love this place. We've gone every week for the past year and half, food is always good, and service is usually always good. I believe they just recently had a change in servers, and the service has been way slower and a lot less attentive since then. Once that changes, my rating will go back up to a 5-stat",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem
Bryan A.,"Herriman, UT",620,61,109,2.0,12/3/2016,"We were severely disappointed in our visit to this location tonight. Granted they were very busy and seemed to have an abundance of large parties and perhaps that contributed , however this is very disappointing. Not only did too of the seven orders not come out , but my ordered sides we're not available. The manager came out and offered me a replacement to which I agreed to a cup of corn which was then brought out ice cold. LOL. Hardly what I would call making amends. I would probably give this location another chance based upon the friendliness of the staff but I would definitely steer away if it was on a weekend night",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem
Curtis C.,"Lehi, UT",163,430,81,3.0,5/7/2015,"We came here after my Mom's graduation at BYU.  After sitting and watching a line slowly progress I was ready to eat.  The place we planned on going to was sold out, so we ended up at Chili's. I've been ordering the triple dipper here since the beginning of time.  You get to pick 3 appetizers for around the price of any other entree.  The southwest egg rolls are fantastic, the boneless wings are okay, and the cheese curds I got were awful.  You can pick from other things as well, but definitely get the egg rolls as one of your 3. I had a watermelon lemonade with the meal that was okay as well.  Skillet queso makes an excellent appetizer. All in all, nothing that I will go back for anytime soon, but if you find yourself forced to go to Chili's, maybe this will help you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem
Kepler R.,"Rexburg, ID",3,4,,3.0,11/5/2016,"A group of three of us came here and as far as service goes it was quick and friendly.

Kaylee H.,"Springville, UT",70,3,,2.0,10/19/2016,"The service was great! But the food was honestly the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. I order the steak and chicken fajita, and the meat was disgusting. The steak was so burned it was black, it looked and tasted like the meat was old and had been pre-made and then microwaved after a couple hours of sitting there. The meat was so tough I couldn't even chew it. I would advise not getting anything that could be pre-made, only order something that they will have to make fresh for you like chicken tenders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem

I. L.,"Lehi, UT",3,56,1,4.0,10/19/2015,"I have, in the past, frequently made the mistake of putting Chili's and Applebee's in the same category: all-around chain restaurants that serve the American spectrum from Tex-Mex to steak and fries. And while their menus and their atmospheres bear out the comparison, there are some definite differences between them, which my wife and I discovered after receiving a gift card to Chili's. See, I hadn't been to Chili's in many years (perhaps never) before a few weeks ago. But in the interest of using our gift card before we forgot about it, we ate there twice within the course of a month. Here's the biggest difference: the food at Applebee's is entirely what you'd expect. Some items are a disappointment, some are tasty, and all are slightly overpriced. The food at Chili's, on the other hand, is consistently above par and reasonably priced. I was impressed both times we ate there. On the first occasion, I got the bacon burger (because how can anyone ruin a bacon burger?). It came with an abundant helping of fries. It was miles ahead of fast food in every department: the bun was toasted, the bacon was thick, and the vegetables had a great presence. Even the pickles were a surprise: firm, garlic-toned and crunchy, with a balance of cucumber and vinegar that I've only ever tasted in one other restaurant (and in the occasional homemade pickle). It was totally delicious. I should warn you, though, that like most burgers this one isn't so great after a night in the fridge. This most recent time around I got the honey chipotle chicken crispers. Frankly, I wasn't expecting them to taste like real honey or chipotle peppers. I mean, when was the last time either of those flavors was fairly represented in a restaurant meal? I was shocked when the crispers tasted strongly of both. Apparently someone at Chili's got the memo: ""honey"" and ""chipotle"" aren't just buzzwords that sound good on a menu, they're actual ingredients. The crispers were plentiful and yummy and paired well with ranch dressing. Our only complaints had to do with the service. We ordered onion rings as an appetizer, and the waiter came back 10 minutes later to tell us they were out. I don't know how you run out of onion rings at 6 PM. I understand that forecasting demand is difficult, but at the very least we should have been informed of the situation before we ordered. Aside from that, there were three of us there and we all ordered items that qualified for the ""2 for $20"" deal. A skilled waiter would have billed the two most expensive items under the deal in order to give us the most favorable price on our check. Instead, our waiter billed the two cheapest items under the deal, leaving the third item at full price. I called her out on the mistake and, after some resistance, she fixed the check (saving us a little under $5). A small issue, but one that a more well-trained waitstaff could have avoided. Overall, I recommend coming here for the (excellent) food, and bringing a good attitude in case the service flounders, which it probably will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=20
Freddy Z.,"Orem, UT",36,7,15,4.0,2/13/2016,"Today my me and my wife ordered from the 2 for $20 menu, although I did also order a house salad since that wasn't an option on the 2 for 20. We chose the guacamole, salsa, and chips. I forgot how good the guacamole, salsa, and chips are, seriously as far as a restaurant goes I don't know if Chilie's or Rubio's has better guacamole!( I may have to do a tie breaker between chilie's and Rubio's guac.) My wife said the guacamole that I make is better, but I think she was just trying to be nice.  As far as our entrees goes, I ordered the chili mango tilapia and my wife ordered the sirloin.  The mango chili sauce has a stronger kick than I was expecting my tongue was actually burning, and I LIKED IT!  Very well evenly seasoned. My wife's sirloin looked very much as excepted. She said it was really good. The only thing about the menu is you can't change anything on each dish, but it does say that on the menu but the sides that they came with was a really good combination.  Over all it was a very good experience.  Side note: the Diet Coke was exceptionally good today for some reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=20
Jacki M.,"Twin Falls, ID",0,32,3,3.0,11/27/2016,"My experience lined right up with the overall 3 star rating for this location.  Not good, not bad..Food was actually pretty great overall but they forgot to give me plastic to go silverware, which sucks when you aren't taking your food home and need it.  They usually ask or put it in.  My salad was squished into a tiny to go container, which was strange.  My tiny dessert was in a HUGE container, which was also strange.  Food was done on time and the guy that checked me out was very nice.  Minor things..We will come again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=20
James F.,"Irvine, CA",353,89,97,3.0,3/28/2014,"Alright so there are some good things about Chili's that I do have to note: 1) The 2 for $20 deal is a pretty good deal. You get to choose two different entrees AND you get one appetizer. My wife and I got the Chicken Fajitas and the 6 oz. steak with broccoli and mash potatoes. With an appetizer and two meals our total was $21.57. And we left completely full. So Chili's is good bane for your buck. The Chicken Fajitas were pretty good. Some of the onions were a little overcooked, but what can you do. 2) The bottomless chips and are pretty good. Fresh baked chips, yum. Seriously, this was my favorite part of our meal. These chips are freshly baked, thin, and crispy. I liked how salty they were as well. Entrees: The food is good, but nothing to write home about.  Service: Our waitress was nice and attentive. I like lemons with my water and our lady made sure that we always had a bowl full on our table (+1 for her)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=20

We love getting the different dips for chips with salsa. Tonight we tried the white spinach queso and it was good, nothing extremely special, though. Their skillet mashed potatoes are amazing. The sweet and smoky was delicious. The tex mex pairing is alright. Wouldn't recommend the soft taco. The tostada and chicken quesadilla are pretty good. I switched the rice for the potatoes- which was a great choice. The black beans are pretty good too. We were planning on getting dessert but we were way to full.

J C.,"McKinleyville, CA",1,12,2,1.0,7/1/2015,"Chili's food is mediocre, at best. The kitchen, at the Orem location, has a problem with speed and timing, when the restaurant gets busy - we have been served cold food... and also had only half of our table served while we waited for the kitchen to complete the remainder of our order. But... what really sets this chain restaurant apart from other local dining establishments is their incredibly HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! We had a party of 11, and they refused to try to accommodate a table of that size at 9:00 PM on a Tuesday evening. (There were plenty of open tables, but they insisted on splitting us.) The server was blunt about being annoyed by the fact that she got stuck with a table of ""kids."" (The table seated 2 adults, and four 15-16 year-olds.) I have been a server - in my experience, even teenagers are aware of how to tip... and, especially when they are accompanied by adults! It is completely inappropriate to vocalize that you are annoyed that you have to take care of your guests WHEN THAT IS YOUR JOB! The management was equally as rude when the issue was addressed. A gentleman approached our table, and... when he got defensive, he literally commented ""if you don't like my tone, you can just leave."" Well played, Manager-sir - we did leave, and will not be returning to Chili's in Orem. I recommend finding a different casual restaurant, in the area - DO NOT EAT AT CHILI'S!!

It has all you need from Chili's at a great price for two. When picking the appetizer in the 2 for 20, always go for the chips and salsa, a smarter idea is get chips and guac (same price, get the whole chips&salsa + GUAC) and obviously go for the Honey Chipotle chicken crispers. Delish. the corn is okay, but very well seasoned, and the fries are to the die for usually, and the chicken with that sauce... MMMM... and the crunchiness....

This is crazy. I had dat new prime rib burrito. I ain't gonna lie it was pretty tasty, I wolfed that biz down like I was leadin the pack you feel me? And I had some of that girly freckled lemonade drank. I wasn't around nobody so it's cool I was just postin. All that was cool too. I was feelin it for a good minute. Yo I didn't even get home when I start feeling the gurgles. Sound like my stomach be rapping to chewbaca or somethin. It hit me hardddd. I ain't never had bowel movements like this. Yo the last time there was a movement this serious, brothas like me starting making some changes around here, ya feel me?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=40
Jonathan D.,"Springville, UT",140,24,31,5.0,1/4/2012,"I love Chili's.  They always have food I enjoy.  The chips and salsa are good, the chips and queso are tasty, the burgers are great, fajitas are yummy, quesadillas mmmmm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=40
Richard S.,"Spanish Fork, UT",0,2,,1.0,4/5/2015,"This used to be a great place to eat. I haven't been there in a couple of years but if there food has slipped this far I haven't missed anything.     My wife and I both had beef and chicken fajitas.  I am not making this up, there were 5 pieces of beef approx. 1"" square x 1/4 "" thick and 3 pieces of chicken about the size of a women's little finger, a pile of onions and a little green pepper.  The beef chunks were inedible, my wife and I both chewed and chewed then had to pull it out of our mouths and put it on the plate.  Out of 10 pieces none could be swallowed, I left the last piece.  If any of you have ever eaten bear meat, this beef was more stringy that that, if you haven't, just imagine it.  The condiments were neatly arranged in little sacrament cups with small amounts of salsa, avocado, jalapeños, sour cream,  shredded cheese, and cilantro.  My mother-in-laws soup was watery without taste, and my sister had a salad.  $60+ later we left.  This is only the second time I have ever complained about a restaurant.  The service was good and she got a good tip.  I'll never go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=40

Justin G.,"Lindon, UT",16,42,,4.0,3/21/2013,"Chili's is an awesome chain dinner restaurant. Fair prices, full flavor, and well-prepared meals.  Nothing extraordinary, but if you're looking for good food at a decent price, chili's is the place for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=40
Stephanie B.,"Red Bluff, CA",0,52,,1.0,4/1/2013,"We went here on a Sunday, and were ignored after we placed our order.  We saw the waiter walk past us several times and look at us, without asking if we needed anything.  After 45 minutes of waiting for our food to be served....we walked out.  Will never go back again!   There was a table in which a large party was seated...but this was the ONLY table our server was paying any attention to....TIP FISHER!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=40
Jessica C.,"Matthews Beach, Seattle, WA",0,3,,1.0,6/16/2012,"The jalepeno burger was pretty tasty, but the service was super slow (not to mention the fact that my fiance and I were ignored once we placed our order, and the servers seemed really confused about what food went to what table) and the restaurant was incredibly dirty. It seemed like the floor hadn't been swept since that morning which isn't exactly appealing. It's just not worth the money, and definitely not a place to go on dates.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=40
Mike B.,"Somerville, MA",2,70,2,4.0,1/30/2012,"Since I had a good experience here last summer, I decided to come back, with my wife this time. We got the two meals for $20 deal which turned out to be a really good deal! An appetizer and two entrees for $20. She got the sirloin which she really enjoyed and it came with a side of mashed potatoes which was surprisingly good. I got the crispy honey-chipotle chicken crispers which were way good! Just thinking about them makes me hungry! Anyway, I'd say this place is surprisingly good for this kind of a chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=40
Jessie M.,"San Diego, CA",334,125,67,2.0,5/15/2012,I don't really like the food there. Every time I go (cause of friends) I try something new to see if they can change my mind about the food but I always end up disappointed. I never go there by choice. I just feel like their food is a waste of my money and horrible way to kill my appetite.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=40
Jeff C.,"Orem, UT",116,230,37,2.0,11/21/2011,I have been a bunch of times and it's very average. Chips and queso are great. But most of the other food is average to poor. They change the menu options  a lot and the burger bites are one thing I like. Good thing my friends paid for it. Not really worth your money. Many other good options around,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=40
R R.,"Orem, UT",0,25,2,1.0,6/11/2015,"The service is hit or miss. And the server(s) will bypass a pair of patrons for a much larger group every time. Must be for the chance of a larger tip. Our server would almost throw stuff at us while en-route to the larger group of customers. The food served is absolutely inconsistant. It is not prepared the same every time we visit the same exact restaurant. I don't understand it. Very frustrating. It appears there is a general manager and a manager of the kitchen, and the kitchen manager seems to ""care less"" about what complaints come it about the food. Depending on the time and day of the week, they're going to do whatever they want and the general manager, server, and customers can kiss off. At least that's my impression after talking to the GM and server. This store must be a problem because there are a lot of bad reviews. I guess most of the good reviews haven't been to a Chili's for quite awhile. I came here years ago with my sister and her husband. My sister ordered a green salad. The salad had a dead black fly under one of the leaves. When we told the server, he told the manager, and he offered to not charge us for the salad. WHAT??? These people have not changed for 30 years, at least at this particular location. So if you come here it may be a good experience, but 3 out of 4 times be prepared for a disappointing one. If you don't mind paying $40 for a meal for 2 and those odds then I guess I'm full of green pooh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=40
