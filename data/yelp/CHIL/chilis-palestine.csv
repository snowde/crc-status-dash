Conner B.,"Laurel, MS",240,168,597,4.0,7/20/2017,"Well lemme tell ya boys and gals, this Chili's is doing justtt fine given the newness of the operation. Can't brag too hard on it, but I damn sure can't hate! Service was a solid B minus, and food was a solid B minus as well, just what the hell I was looking for. Nothing makes me happier than some B minus food for an C minus price. Hell Yeah boy I tell ya, they keep letting Chili's open more locations like this one here, America will be ruling the world until the end of time, mark my word. It was a party of 5 for my visit today, and I think everyone was more than satisfied with their meal, if they say they weren't, then they're a damn lie! We got starters and entrees and hardly any food was left by the time the nice african-american server took away our dishes. Can't wait to come back and order some to-go meals while work-traveling in Palestine. This Chili's shall make a nice addition to the lack of middle grade restaurants! Fuck Yeah!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-palestine
D W.,"Palestine, TX",0,16,,3.0,8/12/2017,"Third time to eat here others had been good but not so tonight. It was busy tonight but able to get seated right away. Wife and myself ordered the 2 for 20 so we got our appetizer and ate it and waited for our meal. We were not in a big hurry so were patient and did not say anything. Our waiter came by and said our meal was late due to My chicken meal was being delayed for some reason. A little latter another employee I presume a manager came by with same excuse. My wife's meal was fajitas so you would think it would take longer. We got our meals and ate but my wife only ate half of hers. After we got home she said her meal was okay at best because part of her meal was cold. Hate it because they should know that , as it has happened to us before at other restaurants.If I want to eat a cold meal I would rather eat leftovers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-palestine
Dorenda S.,"Palestine, TX",43,8,1,2.0,10/15/2017,Okay food.  Server was not very responsive.  Pay kiosk was low battery and server looked annoyed that we asked for our tab.  Kids burgers cooked to a crisp.  Drink refills?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-palestine
Lisa A.,"McKinney, TX",0,22,,1.0,7/30/2017,"I ordered the Ancho Salmon and fiancé ordered the Trio sampler; our waiter was great but the food was very slow coming. My salmon had black crusty stuff on the bottom; my rice and broccoli were salty and room temperature; it also looked nothing like the pic from the menu. His sampler items - fried pickles, sliders and chicken crispers were all room temperature as well.  We talked to 2 managers and they offered to re-do the food but we were hungry and decided to go elsewhere.  Will try back in a month or so after they work the kinks out. July 30th tried Chili's again.  Will give them 1 star solely for the sweetness of our server Sophie.  I ordered Buffalo Chicken Salad and fiancé ordered Sunrise Burger. After seeing people who had come in AFTER us receive their food and a 30 minute wait we received my warm salad and his cold burger without fries.  He sent his burger back and I was mostly done by the time his arrived. I've eaten at about 20 Chili's over the years and have never had such bad experiences - they are 0 for 2 in my book and will not return to this one again.  Our food was comped by manager but would've preferred paying for good food at right temp and not spend more then an hour wasted on so-so food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-palestine
Richard B.,"Alvord, TX",0,39,1,3.0,11/2/2017,"Oh, you know. Typical Chili's. These guys rate better than a 2. Came in to check out the so called new menu which looks to me like a smaller and more expensive menu. My food was indeed hot and fresh. Service was really good. PLace was very busy on a Thursday evening. All and all, a typical Chili's. Predictable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-palestine
Spenser E.,"Tyler, TX",0,9,1,3.0,6/22/2017,Food is good as always. Typical chili's. Never great but tasty enough. The restaurant is way too small. Hardly any waiting area at all. Maybe enough for 4 people to wait on a table. Bar is tiny. Main dining room is way too cramped and loud. Not like the old style chili's restaurants. If you want to talk to who you came with then go somewhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-palestine
Joanie T.,"Hawkins, TX",0,53,3,1.0,8/20/2017,"Ok, they are no longer new. Still major kinks. Food SLOW & COLD. Not like a regular Chilis. WHY keep giving comps & losing local customers? Do it right first time & everybody wins. Will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-palestine
Joe W.,"Kilgore, TX",34,1,,2.0,6/17/2017,Food was what I would have expected from a Chilis. I would go again. My beef about this place is their rounding up the tab. My bill was 11.24 and the waitress rounded that up to 12.00 when she brought my change. This practice is becoming more and more common I suppose.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-palestine
Regular U.,"Palestine, TX",0,6,,2.0,7/31/2017,"We have been here three times since they opened. There has been an item missing from our order all three times. And, the food is just...okay. Definitely nothing special. And, I usually like Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-palestine
Marde J.,"Gilmer, TX",0,6,,1.0,5/28/2017,"Extremely slow.  They appeared to have the appropriate number of waitstaff with three to four tables per person.  Unfortunately, our waitress' trainer neglected to tell her that you actually have to check on your tables sometime while they are seated in your section.  I paid for my food (with the portable pay system) a long time before my food came.  I finally received a refill on my drink after I left a poor review on the survey offered on their portable pay system.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-palestine
