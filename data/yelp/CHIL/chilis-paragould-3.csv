Sarah P.,"Paragould, AR",0,4,,2.0,12/31/2017,"We have ordered a few times for curb side pickup. Most recently Friday. We had the 2 for 20, house salads, we both had the honey chipotle chicken crispers. My husbands chicken was soaked in sauce and mine barely had any on it. The salad tasted old and dried out. Also, the curb side pickup spots were all taken up by customers eating inside. I don't think we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-paragould-3
Will S.,"Paragould, AR",13,1,1,1.0,2/26/2017,"Bad service!!! Seemed to be fully staffed, seem 5 tables not bussed for 30+ min, took 20 min to be seated after being told 10 min. Once seated our waiter never showed up, made eye contact several times we eventually left after no service. So almost an hour with no service and this was my sons first visit there. Left hungry and disappointed ....where was manager??? This was about 6 pm Sunday feb 26th. I'll never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-paragould-3

I think they get to many table to take care of , it would take a little bit for her to come back around ! So then we was asking others for drinks ! My friend took me out for my birthday and there 5 of us !  Let start with the food it was not very hot I would say just maybe off the warm ! Not all came out togather !! Which we try Are best to help we took empty plates and glasses put them To the end of the table . For one thing those are not the ribs they show at all !! They are nasty there no meat on them '!! Me and my friend shared a plate because we did not think we could eat it all ! I had to give her half the steak where she would have something after those nasty ribs 'n then my friend said do you still do the birthday thing she said yes 2 time and said we will bring out a cup of ice cream , my friend said fine bring also one of those chocolate lava cakes too !

Haley D.,"Rockwall, TX",0,9,3,2.0,5/29/2017,"Ate here when we came to town for a reunion. It was storming outside and they weren't very busy. There were 8 of us so we had to wait for them to clean tables. That's understandable. They asked if we minded sitting at separate tables and we told them that we would wait so we could sit together. After about 20 minutes later we were seated. The waitress we had was really sweet but new. We all got our food at separate times, some of us were done by the time others food came out. All of it was cold. We had to ask several times for refills (we even asked other waitresses and they didn't bring them) some of the food was wrong. And the ceiling started leaking in my aunt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-paragould-3
Melanie G.,"Cherokee Village, AR",4,3,1,2.0,11/21/2016,We usually eat there when we go out of town but this time we had fajitas trying something new and they weren't very good! The service was excellent but the fajitas were nothing but onions and green peppers and a greasy taste,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-paragould-3

Chris W.,"Wichita, KS",2,31,10,4.0,11/19/2014,It's your average Chili's franchise. The food is good. The drinks are mixed well. The staff has always been friendly and done well at their job. Being able to use your card at your seating area is a plus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-paragould-3
Justin B.,"Paragould, AR",0,10,,2.0,3/2/2014,"This Chili's (and the chain in general) has changed a lot over the last year. The food is not as fresh, the servings are smaller, and the price is higher. Service and atmosphere have gotten worse and I don't enjoy visiting here anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-paragould-3

Dan D.,"Tomball, TX",41,123,231,1.0,7/4/2010,"The bar was almost half full, but the bartender couldn't care less.  She was busy chatting up the local UFC wannabe in an affliction t-shirt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-paragould-3
