Angela H.,"Huntsville, AL",87,53,37,5.0,10/15/2017,"I was apprehensive about coming here on a busy Saturday night. However, I was very impressed with the team work the two girls in the bar area showed.  Our drinks were never empty and our order was taken and received promptly.  I recommend this Chili's location and we will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
Vanessa C.,"Lone Tree, CO",76,83,229,4.0,2/8/2017,"Previous reviews made me wary to try this Chili's location. However, I feel like most franchise/chain restaurants receive more negative reviews than locals.. Expecting the worse, we walked in tonight for a quick dessert. We were in and out within 20 minutes, or less. It wasn't empty nor was it jam-packed. It seemed like the right amount of people dining inside for a Wednesday night. I was awaiting sticky tables and menus plus dirty floors, as I've experienced those standards in many Chili's locations (in South Florida. This is only my second Colorado). The opposite occurred, sticky-free tables and menus and nearly spotless floors, from where we were seated, near the entryway. Once our waitress (I wish we knew her name!) swiftly arrived to our table, she greeted us with a big smile and proceeded to asking for our dessert order. We ordered only two things. A regular molten lava cake and a caramel molten lave cake. Both were larger than I remembered from my past lava cakes. All so moist and delicious. A few pieces of the scooped ice creams did have tiny chunks of ice, freezer burn? Nothing to complain about. I anticipated the worst but was surprisingly very cheerful of our short experience here tonight. Only four stars because it wouldn't seem fair to give five stars if we didn't try the actual food on the main menus. Maybe next time. However, I did see an awesome but temporary deal for a 3-course meal for $10, which included a select appetizer, select entree, and select mini dessert. You can also upgrade the dessert to full size for $2 more! Thanks Chili's of Parker, CO! For the sweet evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
Andrea M.,"Southeast, Denver, CO",2,18,13,1.0,6/28/2017,"Gave Chilis one last try tonight and they failed again. Over charged for a happy hour beer in the bar and the manager actually argued with me over it.  Sorry waitress, but your manager owes ya some money. This Chilis doesn't know the difference between local craft beer and domestic beer. We're in Colorado, local craft is brewed in Colorado, not California.  Will never go back to Chilis. Horrible customer service by the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
Matt F.,"Littleton, CO",24,106,175,4.0,7/27/2017,"Although I don't really like chain restaurants my experience here today for lunch was really good. We where sat promptly and greated by our waitresses quickly. I ordered the chipotle chicken and waffles, let me tell you this was one of the most satisfying meals I have had in a long time. This was my first time eating chicken and waffles but man what have I been missing out on. We never ran out of drinks and we are getting use to paying on the machine (even though I don't like them at all) so we left quickly. I can't wait to have more chicken and waffles. Give em a try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
Mark H.,"Parker, CO",10,370,110,2.0,4/23/2017,"For 2017 working to review 119 dining places in Parker Colorado, 34 of 120. First of all let me say that the service I experienced at Chilis was good. Our server was on top of it, quick, efficient, and very courteous.  So what's the problem?  The food.  My wife and I started going to Chili's a LONGGGGGG time ago. Back then they made their own fries had just a few burger, ribs and the best chicken tacos ever! Now the food is so process and just not very good.  The salads came with the weeds mix, can't order it with ""hold the weeds"".  My burger came out the lettuce was all wilted and hot from sitting under the heat lamps and burger as thin as McD's. It makes me very sad to see whet this once great chain has become :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
J M.,"Denver, CO",0,20,5,1.0,10/4/2017,Waitress said she was too busy to remember to put in a To go order at the end of our meal....... blonde girl. You cannot be serious chilis? Do they know they are a restaurant?!? I am rolling over in disbelief  We gave up after 20 minutes each time we saw her Manager could not say anything nor comp the meal. He was speechless.

Steve T.,"Denver, CO",2,14,1,2.0,7/28/2017,Why do we come back here? This has to be the slowest Chili's in the country. A good 30 minutes to get our food. The waitress did fine which was some improvement over past visits. We will never learn our lesson.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
Maura L.,"Parker, CO",0,3,2,1.0,10/22/2017,"Super sup par service. We waited a while once we were seated to even be greeted by our server. We had both kids with us on a Sunday evening when the restaurant was not busy. We ordered everything at once- the kids were already tired of waiting and were hungry. Didn't get drinks for a very long time. When she came w drinks she asked us if we were ready to ordered-- but we had already ordered. She gave us two straws- there were four of us. We had no napkins and only two forks. My husband didn't get his beer, she never came back w it. We got up and found our own straws. Then when our 2 year old spilled his milk we found our own napkins too. The food was brought out- the wrong meal for our kids so it had to go back. My husband got steak, I got a chicken bowl. We had no proper silverware and so he went to the entrance of the kitchen to get a knife, which we shared. She talked up adding sour cream and guacamole on my bowl and only sour cream came. At that point I thought oh well. We asked another server for my husband's beer and he got it from the bar. The food was fine, typical Chili's.  But what I think is super tacky is that when my husband was paying she asked to take the kiosk from him. Doesn't it stay at the table?? He intended to take the survey. She STAYED at our table and slowed cleared the table within eyesight of the screen while he waited for her to leave. When he told her he wasn't done with the kiosk she talked for a very long time about how the survey was a pass or fail thing between her and her boss. That anything less than a 5 was a fail. Then she said ""I know it's a Friday and I'm loopy"" (it was SUNDAY-- weird) And ""let's all be nice to each other and if it isn't a 5 then just don't do the survey.""  Sooo tacky!!! What's the point of having a survey then?! But what made us even more mad-- the chili's survey timed out in the time she lingered so that when she left, it was no longer available. Of course. My husband had answered 2 questions before she came but we doubt it counted since he didn't complete it.  Come on, Chili's!! Your server had no reason to have acted this way. One or two mistakes are fine; we understand. But there were so many and the end was completely unprofessional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
Diana L.,"Parker, CO",34,25,9,2.0,6/23/2016,"Well, was so looking forward to a fresh Quesadilla Explosion and Presidente margarita. First off, little to no alcohol in margarita but then that's probably why it was a special for $5. Secondly, the salad was wilted and didn't have the usual balsamic dressing. More if a thousand island but not much flavor. I asked for a side of the balsamic and sure enough I was VERY different from the other stuff. The waitress insisted it had balsamic.  Really?  Rate I a 2 today. Not good. Oh, and did I mention the floor in the kitchen was dirty? Update to this review: the waitress talked to the manager and brought me a real Quesadilla Explosion with fresh greens, crisp crispy noodles, beans, corn, and --wait for it -- warm quesadillas!  That's what I had expected the first time. She also brought the balsamic dressing and I was a happy camper. The manager didn't charge me for the salad. That was smart on his part. I may go back again but it will be awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
Christy S.,"Parker, CO",0,15,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Ordered our favorite chips and salsa. The salsa was good. The chips were overcooked, tasted like they were fried in old oil, stale and not served warm like they usually are. We told the waitress and she brought us another order that was the same and said, ""that's just how they are"". They didn't try to cook a fresh batch or figure out what the problem was. Then our fajitas arrived. They were not sizzling, like usual. The steak was flavorless and barely warm. The shrimp were tiny excuses for what I would get at any restaurant that would served grilled shrimp fajitas. The fajita veggies were not seasoned or cooked, just looked like they put raw onions and peppers on the fajita plate before they added the meats. Before we left, we saw other tables served chips that looked much better that what we were served. Apparently, they wanted to finish the old batch on us. The whole meal was very disappointing. Service was lacking any enthusiasm or interest in ensuring a good meal. Why would we go back? In the past, the Chili's manager would visit tables to ask if your meal was good. This didn't happen. I suppose they already know the answer and don't want to hear the negative feedback. $45 wasted on this meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
Patrick W.,"Castle Rock, CO",11,23,47,2.0,9/22/2016,"Don't where to start but here goes. The service was ok but, I feel the staff need training. I ordered fajitas, steak chicken, and shrimp. The taste was subpar and the shrimp looked nothing like it the shrimp that is displayed in the menu. The steak tasted like nothing, no flavor just warm meat. The chicken didn't get any better. Looked like the cook seasoned it wth Lawry's season salt on the way out to are table. The kids seemed to enjoy what they ate, but what do they know they are only kids eating a meal paid by Dad. Ordered corn tortillas for my tasteless fajitas but the waitress brought bus flour. When I informed her of the mistake she came back with raw corn tortillas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
Heather N.,"Littleton, CO",125,64,11,1.0,2/6/2016,"Chili's gets a bad wrap & I never understood why. Until we ate at this one. We were new to Parker & needed a family friendly restaurant after the pumpkin patch. Chili's was close so we stopped in. Ew. The menus were filthy, food and drink splatters all over-that alone was enough to make me nauseous. We ordered drinks for our kids (10 & 6) and they arrived in large adult glasses, rather than kid cups with lids. When we asked for cups with lids, our waiter acted as though we were being high maintenance. The food wasn't good, the service was slow, and we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2

Jafey A.,"Parker, CO",6,398,,3.0,3/29/2016,"We sat in the bar to watch basketball and have a quick dinner.  The food was good and free chips and salsa were nice, but the service was so slow.  Our server was nice, but we barely saw her and when she did she was always in a rush.  When she'd swing by shed offer a refill or to bring something and after she'd walk by again she would remember, so everything was delayed. It was a disappointing trip, but it was cheap and didn't taste bad so I didn't let it bother me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
D R.,"Aurora, CO",27,15,3,1.0,12/26/2016,"Wish they had a no star button!!!10 minutes to have a waitress offer us drinks. They dropped us kid menus for our kids with no crayons. We ordered some adult drinks, skillet queso, and the kids food first. They brought the kids drinks fairly quick and we ordered our entrees. About another 10 minutes to get out drinks. The kids were served shortly after, then they finally brought our appetizer. The chips looked like the bottom of the bag mostly broken crumbs. We blazed through the chips pretty fast, we were starving. No on came by to check on us or refill our waters and chips. About another 30 minutes goes by with no entrees. I lost it, flagged another waitress down and asked her to find our server to bring us our bill. She came over and didn't apologize for our issue. She said ""I hope everything was good"". Uh yeah, we never got our food! Maybe if you checked in on us things would have got expedited! She then offered to take our entrees off or get them to go. Yeah, I had enough! Besides how could she take them off? They weren't on our bill. I think maybe she didn't ring them in. Either way kids were satisfied, drinks were ok, chips sucked,queso was ok. I wish a manger had come by. Oh almost forgot how filthy the floor was where we sat. I am sure a family with small kids were there before us. Crap everywhere! I used my foot as a broom so I wouldn't need to step in it. This probably goes down in my top 5 worst restaurant experience in my 40+ years of life. No way I will ever come close to this place or ever recommend this place. I would rather tell all my friends and family to avoid this place like the plague. As far as Chilis goes, maybe I will try another location. I will be extremely cautious. Thank GOD for Freddys Steakburgers drive thru. We got to eat after all!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2
Joanne L.,"Albuquerque, NM",37,154,42,4.0,1/4/2016,"Stopped in for lunch with my mother in law during a recent visit to Parker upon arrive they were busy so we decided to sit in the bar area the empty tables did have plates on them but it didn't take but a minute for us to clear off one to sit at we didn't mind since the staff seemed super busy.  Our waitress came over within a few minutes and took our drinks order she was very patient with us while we looked over the menu and decided what we wanted to eat in between chatting.  My mother in law ordered the lunch combo of side salad, burger and fries and I ordered a side salad half sandwich and fries. I don't know how long we waited for food because we were chatting and I didn't pay attention to the time but it didn't seem awfully long and when our food arrived it was hot fresh and all tasted great no complaints. Our waitress did great about keeping our drinks topped up and checking in with us without been in our face which I liked.  I just want to note that I never eat at our local chillis in Albuquerque due to bad experiences but that's for another review- so my expectations were low however I expect high standards and am not necessarily easily pleased but I had no complaints with this chillis.  The only reason I knocked off a star is because the entire time we were there the tables seemed to be full of plates I understand they was busy and like I mentioned we didn't mind clearing off our own table however there clearly needs to be something done about that. The staff seemed to be working very hard so my assumption would be there understaffed in the bar area because it didn't appear to be because they weren't working hard enough.  I would return to this location- Oh and they also offer a discount for military",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2

Christy R.,"La Mesa, CA",3,42,2,1.0,6/1/2015,"After being on a plane, all day, we were hoping for a hot meal. Disappointing is an understatement. My first stop was the rest room, which hadn't been checked/cleaned in a while. Got to the table, picked up our menus, and they were covered in food and grease. Only got worse: Our waiter was brand new and couldn't figure out the computer system. We ordered appetizers, which we never got. After 25 minutes we still had not gotten our meal. We decided to leave. We asked for the manager. He could of cared less. We told him all that had transpired. His response: ""Yeah, he's new.""

Brenda P.,"Aurora, CO",33,191,28,3.0,6/14/2013,"If you are on a sodium restricted diet, your choices at Chili's are EXTREMELY limited. I got the house salad with Avocado ranch dressing and it was almost 800 mg of sodium. Pretty high for a small salad. Most items on their menus are well over 3000 mg of sodium per serving, and some come in at over 5000 mg. Disappointing, since I have to keep my sodium to 2000 mg per DAY for a healthy lifestyle. However, if you carefully check their nutrition guide online, you will be well informed and can make the best choice to suit your dietary needs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=40
Anita B.,"Parker, CO",1,27,1,2.0,10/11/2013,"I should start by saying I usually enjoy eating at Chili's.  But the past few times that I have visited this location, I have been very disappointed.  About a month ago, I was there at lunchtime and because we were in a hurry, we agreed to be seated in the bar area.  The server who was responsible for us spent most of his time chatting up the 16 year old girls who were at another table.  We had to wait 15 minutes to even get water and had to ask repeatedly for things like refills and a few lemon wedges for the water.  The food was fine (I almost always get a salad).   And then tonight we decided to go for dinner.  Since it was Friday night, we knew we'd be in for a bit of a wait.  I have to say this is the last time I will go there at dinnertime!  We were told our wait would be about 30 minutes, which is not bad for 7pm on a Friday night.  My frustration grew as table after table emptied but no one in the waiting area was being seated as they emptied.  Five tables emptied, and one party was seated.  Then another three tables emptied and one party was seated.  At one point there were 6 parties of people (us included) waiting for a table while there were at least 10 empty and clean tables just sitting there.  It has to be the most egregiously inefficient seating process that I have ever seen.  In the interest of fairness, I will say that the server tonight was very helpful and attentive... a nice change from our last visit to this Chili's.   I will avoid this restaurant at all costs for dinnertime; the food isn't nearly good enough to warrant putting up with such frustrating management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=40

Rebecca R.,"Parker, CO",3,32,9,1.0,5/30/2015,Chili's is not what it used to be. The quality of food is beyond horrible! I ordered the chicken fajitas and the chicken had the consistency of rubber! I had a tough time eating what they call chicken. Please work on the quality of your food and don't cut corners on that!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Keith P.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,10,,4.0,7/10/2016,"I live nearby, and this place is one of my reliable go-to spots for a good meal. They can get busy during the dinner hour, so there can be some understandable delays in seating and order-to-service time, but I've always found the food to be a good value for the price, and the wait staff has a good attitude overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Brian S.,"Parker, CO",82,470,189,2.0,10/9/2013,"It had been a good 10 years since I stepped foot inside a Chilis/Applebees/TGINasties and I don't know how I fell off the wagon the other day when I found myself here getting a To-Go order for a late lunch.  I mean, C'mon Man! The bartender was friendly and fast, so there's a positive point there.  It appears they remodeled in the last few months, but you can't remodel the fact that the food is the lowest quality they could possibly find and tastes horrible.   Dear Self:  I'm sorry, I'll never do that again.  Only real food goes in the tummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Abe M.,"Parker, CO",85,160,23,2.0,2/2/2014,"Why can't the food or the service at Chili's be consistent? We went to the Parker Chili's with on a gift certificate we received for Christmas, and even with a free meal, we felt duped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Lee S.,"Parker, CO",184,417,41,3.0,8/28/2012,"It was my son's turn to pick the restaurant and he loves the sliders. I hadn't been in here for years and thought, ""okay."" Football is on the TV's. We were seated right away...but seemed to wait forever for service. Then, like magic, we had one the best waitresses and service I have had in any restaurant for a long time...quick, friendly, knowledgeable. The beer and beverages...cold. The food...average.  When I eat out, I want the ""wow...wee"" and it wasn't present. Oh, and ""Happy Hour"" all day every day...little beers seemed out of place. Will I go back...only when it is my son's turn to pick...or I may have to overrule his choice",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Matthew M.,"Castle Rock, CO",100,113,5,3.0,2/15/2015,"Food is good but salty. Ambience is fine. Serve is decent. I can't stand the electronic checkout. Go for the two for 20, enjoy and get out. Typical chain experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Amanda B.,"Parker, CO",7,29,5,4.0,4/12/2015,"We usually do not frequent chain restaurants, but decided to try since it is close to our new home.  Pleasantly surprised!  It's been years since eating at a Chilis and I was expecting the Chilis from the past.  Instead, I was greeted with revamped decor, menu and overall clean seating. Food was wonderful!  Service was on key even during the busy dinner rush.   Very pleasant surprise, indeed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Jenn B.,"Littleton, CO",245,387,459,2.0,7/29/2013,"In my opinion, the quality of food has been declining at Chili's everywhere for years. Overdone, starchy corn on the cobb, tough ribs, and flavorless mashed potatoes. The only good thing about our last visit was our enthusiastic waiter. But I'm not coming for the personalities, I'm coming for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
T L.,"Denver, CO",0,64,,1.0,7/19/2015,"Went on Fri.and sat in the bar. It never fails, the menus are always sticky!! Is it possible to clean them? My husband's beers were warm and not in a frosted glass. Food was fair, not great. This is the same story every time we go, it certainly is a disappointment, Would be nice if management would do something to ironed these issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Lisa A.,"Parker, CO",9,126,12,4.0,12/18/2013,"We went to Chili's the other night after a long day. I arrived first with my two young kids with my hubby on his way to join us from work. They seated us promptly and took us to a nice booth off the to side. I got the chicken specialty dish which was very good. My hubby ordered another special but they accidentally gave him Monterrey Chicken instead. We politely pointed it out and they were fantastic. They offered to swap it for us but we declined and said it really was no problem.  When the bill came they had comped his meal and gave us a free dessert. I was really grateful and impressed. All in all, a very good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Jordan K.,"New River, AZ",3,46,6,2.0,3/30/2014,"This place needs help with staffing. They just spent all this money doing a remodel but really need to restructure the management. Asked 3 times for silverware and constantly had to ask for refills. For some reason my folks love this place, but as for me and my wife we will not be back.

Jodi O.,"Parker, CO",1,6,,1.0,4/5/2012,"My husband and I went and ate on the 30th of March in the evening.  We normally like going to chili's and enjoy it but this night was not good.  First of all we had two young girls seating behind us and all night long our waiter along with another waiter kept going over to the girls and hitting on them.  Come on.... really I am trying to eat here!  Our waiter finally took our order and when the food came my spinach dip was cold not hot like its suppose to be.  The waiter also ask my husband and I if we wanted something else to drink.  We both said yes and our waiter brought my drink and went to talk to to the girls again forgetting my husband's drink. He finally came around and said oh I was suppose to get you your drink huh?  Frickin duh... come on, do your flippin job not flirt all night buddy.  I hope Chili's gets there crap together because I won't be going back there for awhile.  Dear lord,  please don't let Chili's 30 year old waiters hit on my teenage daughter if she goes there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Brandy P.,"Parker, CO",182,30,7,5.0,10/23/2014,"I went there for lunch today and sat at the bar,  the bartender was exceptional and very attentive.   The service was def a 10 out of 10.  I ordered a Fat tire he let me know there was a special thankfully and I ate the honey Chipotle chicken crispers.   The meal was fantastic, the chicken was evenly coated in sauce.  I have to also throw in the menus weren't sticky!  Most Chili's restaurants menus are sticky and it drives me nuts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
Jeremy R.,"Aurora, CO",31,15,8,4.0,1/23/2013,I know it's corporate food but I still enjoy Chili's every once in a while. The chips and salsa alone are worth the trip. It probably only gets a 4 star rating from me because of nostalgia (I ate there all the time in college and high school) but I do enjoy a lot of their food. The chicken enchilada soup is great for lunch. I also like the Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadillas. I haven't had a burger there in forever (there are better places to go for a burger). My wife also loves the Quesadilla Explosion Salad. Service is usually pretty good too. Always fast and friendly. It's still a chain but I'm alright with that from time to time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
G N.,"Denver, CO",0,60,2,3.0,8/23/2013,"First time here since the remodel. It's pretty nice inside now, things look better.  The food is obviously the same, it's good food if you like high-sodium diets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20
