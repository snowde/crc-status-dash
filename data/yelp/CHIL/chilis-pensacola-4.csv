Zoe V.,"Paris, France",126,8,31,5.0,12/27/2017,"Love Chili's. Used to have one in my college town but it closed so I go to this one every chance I get. I have never had a bad experience and the staff is always wonderful, efficient, and uplifting!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Angela C.,"LaGrange, OH",13,15,,1.0,12/30/2017,"I don't know where the other people thought they were when they wrote their reviews on this dump, but I for one will tell you if you want ANY service at all....DON'T go here. My husband and I walked in, got seated right away, sat at our table, the ""waitress"" looked us dead in the eye, and proceeded to talk baby talk to a child seated at the table in front of us, turned and walked away. We waited for about 5 minutes before we got up  and walked out!! Southern Hospitality????? Not alive in this hole. We have gift cards that we need to use, I suppose  we  will just have to go and use them somewhere besides in the greater Pensacola area. This is the second one we were at and got the same crap service. No wonder they are going out of business, if you want people to come to your restaurant, then maybe you should train your employees in customer service!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Jim K.,"Pensacola, FL",2,3,2,5.0,10/21/2017,Quick lunch service. Had the bacon Avocado Chicken Sandwich and it was delicious.  The bun very one of the best I've had for a sandwich. Fries were cooked very well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Autumn B.,"Pensacola, FL",231,53,30,2.0,11/25/2016,"Food was pretty good today. Service subpar as usual and for a bar that isn't busy at all, there are dirty dishes everywhere. Chips and salsa are always delicious here and prime rib fresh bowl solid lunch dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Charlene W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,1,,1.0,5/31/2017,Went there tonight was not busy . Got seated right away . Got the 3 for 10.00 meal salad was awesome but when my food came out it had a hair in my food . The server took the plate and had it remade but not once did she say sorry or do you want to see a manager didn't even give us a discount for the hair . So safe to say I won't be back to this one .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
J E L.,"Pensacola, FL",5,334,38,3.0,1/19/2017,"Menu Looks Great For a Chain. I wasn't overwhelmed by the Big Mouth Burger Bites, but they were decent. The slightly spicy panko breaded onion rings were pretty good for a frozen product. There's a lot of new Mexican dishes on the menu that look worthwhile. I only stopped here out of starving necessity, but have to admit this is the only chain menu I can think of that looks appealing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Larry G.,"Pensacola, FL",4,1,1,3.0,4/17/2016,"Just walk , the service is fast but salad was not fresh.  Cucumbers were old offered-to the server said no! However they do sell fresh salad. Honey chipotle barbecue sauce is excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Lance L.,"Arlington, TX",0,13,8,5.0,1/7/2017,"Really?   5 Stars?   Yes!  Great staff that makes the experience fun.   Plus,  the avocado sirloin 10 oz is so good. Garlic,  tomatoes and fresh greens are just amazing.   Yeah,  it's a chain,  but they have some flat out amazing dishes and service.  I'm coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Wendy P.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,4,,2.0,6/5/2017,"I'll give them 2 stars, because the steak was cooked perfect... But there ends the ""good""... The Honey-Chipotle or Chipotle-Honey (?) had ZERO spices, but was too sweet to eat... The shrimp that had a beautiful caramelized coating on the menu??? Were actually undercooked, slimy shrimp, floating on a plate in liquid (I think it was supposed to be the Chipotle-Honey flavoring... But, the menu showed NO POOL of sludge, so I don't really know!) Fine, I used a napkin and wiped off as much as I could, and tried to feed them to my dog. He loved the steak, but even my dog wouldn't eat the shrimp. There was definitely SOMETHING wrong with them- whether it was JUST because they were raw, or were unsafe? I don't know... Then- since I got VERY LITTLE to eat?? I ordered the molten lava cake (which I've had in several different states, and many different locations!)... She brought me the lava cake, as intended- but, it was smothered in CARAMEL!! When I asked to get one without the caramel- she opened the menu, and pointed out the caramel in the photo... YES, THERE IS A SMALL AMOUNT, ON THE PLATE ONLY, NOT ON TOP OF THE DESSERT! Ugh... I know better! Because, then, she brought me a dry cake, EMPTY, without ANY FILLING! YUCK!  Don't waste you time, or your buck, at the Pensacola, Bayou Blvd Chili's... They seem to believe that the menu?? Is really just a suggestion... And they can serve WHATEVER they choose! (About 85% of the Chili's, I've visited... Have been outstanding!! Just don't go to this particular location.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Katrina W.,"Pensacola, FL",0,16,5,4.0,9/11/2015,"I don't know why this particular Chili's pushes a busy bar (which they call a lounge) for lunch! Please don't do that, I don't want to drink for lunch and go back to work, especially in a busy bar (I know a bar when I see one) with one server! It is irritating!  Other than that, I like the new menu items and always love their chips and salsa. Salads are excellent and my favorite are the Chicken Tortilla or Loaded Baked Potato Soups. Excellent fare for a chain restaurant.   Brandon, one of the  servers, is above average and great at his job. He has extensive knowledge of the menu, keeps the drinks full, and knows who to give the bill to at the end of the meal. While most of the servers are good, Brandon is top notch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Elizabeth G.,"Pensacola, FL",2,99,139,4.0,6/19/2016,"Food is fairly good.  The prime rib tacos are awesone.  I have tried many of their dishes only gotten sick twice. The place looks clean, but does not feel clean. So far all waitress have been nice, and efficient. This chilis has improved their service. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Dees R.,"Gainesville, FL",0,3,,1.0,1/12/2017,"0 stars deserved but I had to give 1 to move the post along.    One manager's blatant racist act against a United States veteran with a service dog and documentation to prove it, was deplorable. Go here to view details.  ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Shobi K.,"San Lorenzo, CA",0,40,4,5.0,8/24/2015,"This review is particularly for server mike t.  He is absolutely fantastic.  I am a server myself in the Navarre area and I must say its awful walking into an establishment without being acknowledged and even worse the host walking right past you more worried about getting a create a pepper on the door. Which is exactly what happened. Mike t. Saw me and even with food in his hand seated me and told me he would be right with me, now that's taking care of a customer! No way was it even busy for the host to ignore me in that way. This 5 star rating is solely for mike t. I give a negative star for the hostess hopefully she gets shit for this review she should look for another job, she's terrible at being a host.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Renee C.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",7,57,85,2.0,3/12/2015,"Let me start with the service was very good. Now for the food! Lemon in one of our waters was old and completely brown. My Margarita container lid was stuffed with straw paper and a customer receipt from 3/7  which tells us it wasn't even cleaned since today is 3/12. My salmon was good but the broccoli was old, dry and I didn't eat it. The rice was dry and not fresh.  We tipped 20 percent because the girls weren't responsible for the lack luster food or the dirty shaker lid. They did remove my drink from the bill however we were told the manager was coming to the table but he never showed! I will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Jen T.,"Dallas, TX",131,416,115,2.0,7/20/2014,"Gosh I hate giving bad reviews but last night our dinner was unforgivable. I could have thrown up a better meal.  We ordered some loaded fries and asked for no bacon only to have it brought out to us loaded with bacon. Then my husbands $17 sirloin came out, again the mashed potatoes were loaded with bacon, wth. He asked for his meat to be medium rare and the cook had no clue what he was doing, it was raw on one side, over cooked on another, and overly salted, it was a mess. After scraping the mound of bacon off we tried to eat the potatoes and couldn't, they tasted powdery to me, it was weird. At least they got the broccoli right, that would have been sad if they hadn't.  I got the Mexican bowl expecting it to taste like Chipotle, big error on my part because my expectations were no where close to being met.  The mango sweet tea was awesome though, and they now have it to where you can pay at your table at a little kiosk, that was cool, and it asks you about your experience.  Our waitress was very nice and we let her know she didn't do anything wrong and that we appreciate her but the food was awful, she apologized and asked if we wanted to speak to the manager. At that point my angry/disappointed/hungry husband just wanted to get out of there. I hate to say it just because of one bad experience but there really is no good reason for us to visit a chilis establishment again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Cassy C.,"Buckeye, AZ",27,30,7,4.0,7/20/2014,You know what?  Chili's has good Mexican/Southwest cuisine!  John is a great waiter!  I had the chicken enchiladas and they were very well seasoned.  Pensacola has very few restaurants that serve Good Mexican food...I think this is our go to place now! Rice wasn't anything much but blk beans were good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Katherine S.,"Shalimar, FL",0,7,5,1.0,2/29/2016,"Ordered online curb side pick up. Showed up on time and waited about 15mins past the pick up time before calling to find out what was up and was told that there was no one on shift tonight to run out online orders. Okay, things happen, the problem was that my food was also cold. Very Disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Amanda D.,"Swansboro, NC",0,100,,4.0,10/7/2015,Hits the spot and fills the standard for a (good) Chili's. The boneless buffalo wings are a must - crispy & perfect sauce. Service was quick and friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Tiff C.,"Pensacola, FL",193,489,3235,4.0,10/14/2013,"$28.76. was the total bill for 2 people( me and my Panda bear). What might you ask did 2 hungry people get for Twenty-Eight dollars and 76/100? We got an appetizer which consisted of a chicken chipotle flatbread, VERY good(Is this a Chili's?) and 2 entree's. I had the chicken fajita's with a side of beans and rice, good and my Panda bear got the chicken tenders and fries, he too as well had no complaints. Strawberry Lemonade(soo good) and a coke for him. $28.76. Their Happy hour lasts all day which I didn't know. Some people like to knock chain restaurants but I give credit where credit's due. You cant beat a 3 for $20 deal at a sit down restaurant, in a clean environment, with good wait staff. Typical Chili's? Who knows, but I ain't complanin'.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Rich H.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",0,26,8,1.0,5/5/2015,"Bad service.  Food not worth the money or wait. We waited for a table for 20 minutes for three people.  (Nobody was ahead of us). Several were open but maybe they were short on servers.  No big deal. Ordered 3 margaritas, they took 45 minutes.  Ordered dinner.  Another 45 minutes.  Ordered drinks (because our waitress disappeared after taking our initial order) on the little digital on table screen, 35 more minutes pass and I'm sitting here with no margaritas. So 3 tacos, a plate of apps, and 6 margaritas.  Two + hours and 65 bucks.  Not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4
Bill S.,"Sarasota, FL",1,23,,1.0,1/25/2015,"Horrid service - This was the second chance  Chili's asked for and on a relatively uncrowded Sunday at 5:10, one might think that someone would stop by the table and offer at least a drink order.  But, NOOOO!  Waited 10 minutes, waived at two waitresses, but three nearby tables got service and not so much as a glance at mine.  So I left and went to Tijuana Flats across the street.   Got good service and pleasantly intelligent staff.  Save a trip, skip Chili's and go where business is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4?start=20
Ian L.,"Lusby, MD",0,14,,4.0,1/10/2015,"Good food and service. No complaints. Brought my wife and three kids (ages 7,2,1) here for dinner and were taken care of from beginning to end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4?start=20
Jami S.,"Pensacola, FL",0,7,1,1.0,9/19/2015,"Have been here twice and weren't too pleased. Tonight, the third time, we walked in just for dessert and waited for 10 minutes but were never sat. Two female servers were on the floor then went back to the kitchen and never acknowledged us. It just isn't worth the hassle to eat there.  We left and came to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4?start=20
Kristi g.,"Springfield, VA",41,163,14,3.0,12/28/2012,"So a typical Chili's, but I think it is cleaner than others I've been to. My daughter loves the soup, so we end up here once every few months. We normally sit in the bar area (my daughter is 18, so I'm not sitting at the bar with my toddler) as I find the wait staff to be friendlier and usually more engaged with their tables. Sometimes our orders are right, sometimes small fixes have to be made but for a chain, it isn't that bad (Applebee's is kind of funky), and their drinks are pretty good- occasionally I'll have a margarita. Their chips are the cantina style, our family's favorite. We usually stick with soup, salad or appetizers- so can't speak for entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4?start=20
Chris H.,"Kennesaw, GA",5,45,,3.0,3/22/2012,Went there for lunch on a Thursday.   Got there at 11 just as they opened and there was only one other table being used.  They messed my order anyway by putting mayo on the sandwich when I asked for no mayo.  Took about 5 minutes before the waitress finally came back by so I could tell her about the mess up.   Took about another 7 or 8 minutes to get a new sandwich.  Food was good once it got there.  Ketchup bottle on table was empty.   Not sure how that happened since we were the first ones to use that table that day.  Waitress took quite a while to finally bring our check as well after she said she was going to go get it.   Just seems like service would be better if there are several waitresses and only 2 tables with customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4?start=20
Rose S.,"San Ramon, CA",257,142,9,4.0,12/22/2009,"I went here with a friend on a Monday morning. We both had the 2 for 1 sex on the beach drinks and the sirloin steak with loaded mashed potatos, fries, and mashed potatos and gravy. The food was great and everything was cooked well done as requested. The wait staff was timely and friendly. I enjoyed the atmosphere and would not mind dining here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pensacola-4?start=20
