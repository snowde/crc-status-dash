Nathan V.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,4,1,5.0,12/3/2017,"Is Chili's a five star restaurant, decorated with fine furniture, a warm atmosphere, and established as a reputable restaurant? Or is Chili's a local restaurant with charm, a bustling local scene, bursting with culture? Chili's is, in fact, both. Chili's is a blend of that hometown restaurant that only you know about as well as the great experience of a steakhouse. There's nothing better than walking into a Chili's. If you want to have a great time, you're in the right place. First, restaurant was clean, smelled great, and has music at a reasonable volume. The greeter is always attentive to welcome you in. We were seated quickly, and our server was very friendly and attentive. He quickly took care of us and gave us water (we even had 7 people at our table and he still was on top of it all). Even better, the food came out quickly, and it was hot off the grill. I personally got the Sunrise Burger, and I can tell you, it was AMAZING. It is by FAR one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Lastly, dessert. I got the molten lava cake. You've probably heard it before. It was DIVINE. Warm, delicious fudge inside a fluffy cake topped with a cool vanilla ice cream scoop. Nothing beats that! Not to mention it was my 21st birthday. And I can say that it was one of the best birthdays I've had in a LONG time. I couldn't think of anywhere else to spend my birthday other than Chili's! If you're on the fence about trying out Chili's or haven't been in a long time, it is definitely worth your time and money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22
Janine D.,"Phoenix, AZ",71,143,286,2.0,8/16/2017,"went here after a movie. there were only a number of customers seated but yet it took a while to get our food; we only ordered appetizers by the way. we had the buffalo fried cauliflower, fresh guacamole with chips, and the margharita flatbread.  the fried cauliflower was actually good. i guess this is new in their menu. the guacomole is a miss. it felt lacking so we put a bit of lemon, salt, and black pepper on it to make it in to our liking. the flatbread tasted good but a bit burnt on the side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22
Brittany C.,"Glendale, AZ",746,193,740,4.0,1/7/2017,"Went here today with friends and family. I love that they have so many different options on the menu that it's perfect for those that are eating healthy and those that are not. Service is always great here as well and I like their lunch specials. Everything on the menu is good priced.  I got the chicken fajitas. It's one of my favorite dishes. Simple but so much flavor. My friends got the quesadilla explosion salad and the margarita salad that  they both enjoyed. My fiancé tried one of the seasonal BBQ dishes with the sausage and crispers and didn't care for it. It was small portions and pretty bland.  I recommend to go with the classics here food wise, can't go wrong! But great place to have options. Good lunch specials, happy hour, and to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22
Tricia C.,"Phoenix, AZ",510,251,1203,3.0,6/10/2017,"We started with the spinach queso dip. It was decently good. I mean how can you go wrong with melted cheese? The cheese in the dip was a white cheese that had a mild flavor that went well with the spinach that was nicely chopped up in the dip. My favorite part was the scoop of guac in the center of the dip. Unfortunately, the guac was mostly one hard piece of avocado. I had to use my knife to cut it down to scoopable chip sized pieces. To make the queso dip better, I think maybe adding some garlic flavor to it should do the trick. The dip came with a large basket of chips and a small bowel of salsa. I have always loved Chili's chips. They are so thin, yet so crispy.  For dinner, we ordered the honey chipotle Chicken Crispers and a fresco side salad. The honey chipotle Chicken Crispers came served on top of waffles and were topped with applewood bacon, jalapeños and green onions.  The honey chipotle sauce was surprisingly spicier than I thought it would be, which I liked. The were supposed to drizzled with ancho-chile ranch, but I didn't really notice any ranch anywhere so it either wasn't there or was really lightly drizzled. The chicken was really good. It was nice and moist on the inside. The waffles were ok, nothing to write home about. The waffle were kind of dry and a little on the dense side. The crispers came with a side of homestyle fries and a side of honey chipotle sauce. I drizzled the extra honey chipotle sauce over my waffles to give it more flavor and help moisten them up a bit. I liked the sauce so much I also dipped my fries in it. The fresco side salad was a basic spring mix salad topped with queso fresco dressed in a honey lime vinaigrette. For a side salad, it was a decent size. It was refreshing and helped break up the heavy dinner and appetizer. I really liked the dressing that was on it.  We got our leftovers to go and our waiter brought out a bag for our chips and had some extra chips in the bag for us! OMG! Chips! I love that their bags are tailored for reheating their chips in the microwave so you can have hot chips at home! Our waiter was awesome. It think his name was Martino? (I am so sorry if that was not your name) It was like he could read my mind. Everything I needed before I even needed to ask for it or even before I knew I needed it. I wish he could be my waiter everywhere I go. 5 stars for you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22
Dolores D.,"Buena Park, CA",111,28,80,4.0,10/15/2017,Love coming to this location. Especially there's a cute waiter therewas disappointed cause they did run out of queso. Had to wait 20 mins for it but it didn't even feel hot or warm and didn't feel fresh. Usually the queso is the best. Literally the only reason I love coming to Chilis with the chips and salsa. Their food is good. I usually get the chicken crispers or ribs which I love.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22
Erica B.,"Phoenix, AZ",127,237,77,3.0,11/9/2016,"I'm not big on chains because everything always taste like it comes out of the frozen section aisle in the grocery store (unless it's Bonefish or Outback :) Chill's is no exception!  Just go for happy hour and bar food only .. maybe even just drinks, chips and salsa. I got off work early last week and decide to grab 2 happy hour drinks at Chill's while I waited for a friend to get off work.  Besides myself there were 6 other people in the entire restaurant on a Thursday afternoon (3:30-4 ish).  I ordered the Presidente Margarita because the bartender told me how this one was so much better than the regular Margarita.  Nothing taste Presidential about the damn thing!  Cool .. I decided after my second sip that my next drink would be liquor, ice and lime.   Before my second drink I ordered the happy hour portion of Texas fries.  They look so good on the menu.  When I received mine however, they were old fries that were just sitting for a while, then thrown in the oven with cheese, bacon and peppers ... all the things I like but it seems they must have forgotten about the the Texas fries in the oven because the skillet was scorching hot but the fries taste old and the cheese was almost burnt and the bacon pieces were so hard that I just decided not to include any on my fork.  Bummer! I followed by gut and ordered just a well Tequila, on the rocks with lots of lime.  I'll go back to Chill's for happy hour ONLY because it's across the street from job.  I wouldn't bother stopping in otherwise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22
Sirk H.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,13,14,1.0,4/14/2017,"Walked into this Chili's this evening, April 14, 2017, and walked right back out less than 10 minutes later. We we seated right away, my lady placed her beverage order (margarita) and that came approx 3 minutes later. I noticed how sticky the table was, so I got a napkin and her sanitizer. Lo and behold, some bullshit appeared on the napkin. We closed the menus, and advised them that we would be leaving. They asked ""why"" in a concerning tone, so I showed them how clean their tables aren't! Disgusting!! The manager acted appalled as well. How could you NOT notice how dirty the tables are, when you work here and are constantly ""wiping"" them down. The napkin looked like I wiped the bottom of my Vans after walking through old car oil.

In less than ten minutes of walking into the restaurant and being seated, we noticed how sticky the table was. My partner rubbed the table down with a napkin and sanitizer, and lord Behold dirt and glitter on the napkin. The table was so dirty that the dirt appeared black on the napkin. If they can't even clean/sanitize the table then what makes you think that they can clean their plates, forks, glasses or anything else at the establishment. We were so disgusted that we walked out.

R G.,"Glendale, AZ",0,9,,1.0,6/1/2017,"Eh. For some reason during lunch, although they did not seem busy (I'm assuming because all employees were standing around on their phones), it took about 5 minutes to be greeted, another 20 for our food, and an extra 10 to get the bill because our Ziosk wasn't working. Our server had a friendly enough voice, yet had the angriest look throughout the entire meal and right before leaving we overheard another server specifically say ""I hate Chili's so much"" to the hostess. I thought these super corporate restaurant chains were supposed to have some of the happiest employees?  Also, I'm not one for having to be dolled up every moment, but the employees here look like they've all had a rough night.

Jon R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,,2.0,3/30/2016,"This is a long review, by far my longest, but I feel this must be done.    I  have been a frequent of chili's for the past 25 years. When I graduated from bootcamp (USMC), my dad asked me where I wanted to go. Could have been anywhere, and I mean anywhere, but I said Chilis because I wanted the original chicken crispers, And I have gotten the chicken crispers every time almost since the beginning. They are the best in the crisper business, especially when u pair them with chili's awesome ranch and honey mustard.  I have been coming less and less though over the past year. While service stays on par, the quality of food is going down. The crispers have gotten to the size of a MC Donald's chicken nugget and the wife and I both agree the chicken always seems chewy. Not like how it used to be. My orders of kid crispers 25 years ago had more food on the plate then my order yesterday. And it's not just this experience. It is almost every experience. I could keep going on how disappointed I am with what this location has done to my love for chilies original chicken crispers but I feel my point is made.... My wife normally gets the pasta dish on the 2/20 menu and does not order it anymore because something about it changes or they cook it wrong every time.  I will give them a high five for not messing up the side salad yet but I am not keeping my hopes up. Also the panko fried onion rings (i think it is what they were called) were pretty good and I would order them again if I return before they take them off.  So the service is decent. The bartender/ cocktail server/ hostess does her best. But whenever we are there she seems to be the only one who actually cares about customer service. She can take a while to get to you but she seems to do more then anyone there. So kudos to her. I can't remember her name but she is always in the bar it seems after 4 PM when we go.  I will also give them another high five because this location keeps it pretty clean. From the outside to the doors to the bathrooms to the floors. It's clean.  This location is right down the street from me but I will start going to different locations to see if the chicken crisper problem is this store or chain wide. I am ready to give up on this location but not my crispers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22
Steve R.,"Cave Creek, AZ",2,16,4,4.0,7/24/2016,"Always good service, great food usually little to no wait even on Fridays and Saturdays, the only reason it's not 5 stars is the takeout portion sometimes gets orders wrong, and or gives you cold food so if you order take out make sure you double check the order",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22
David L.,"Phoenix, AZ",111,177,34,3.0,4/26/2016,"Different experiences at different times and different days and even different parts of the restaurant. I guess some servers have it and some don't. What I look for in a sit-down eatery is someone who checks up, roughly 12-15 mins apart, make sure drinks are always full, and be a little friendly. Well, it doesn't always work out at this Chili's but my experience has never been bad. Just lacking sometimes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22
Jerry M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,,1.0,3/15/2016,"Hey just a shout out to all you fellow Yelpers. This location/franchise is rotten from the top down. The pervasive apathy of the staff, including the manager is pathetic. I had not been to a Chili's in quite some time and after my experience today, I am sure my next visit will sometime around the 1st of Neveruary! I wish I could make this blog short but no I'm sorry this deserves some detail!  So I stopped by today around 4:30 for some happy because traffic was backed up on the 101. The bar was nearly empty and a server was sitting at the bar sharing a ""bitch session"" with the bartender. I ordered only two items- a Fat Tire draft beer and an order of wings with what I think to be a simple and common request- that the wings be cooked well done and extra crispy. What I was served about ten minutes later was this hot mess pile of tiny, under cooked, over sauced, soggy, biggest insult to Buffalo wings I have ever encountered. I ate one bite of one wing and it could not have been more perfectly, 100% opposite of what I had ordered and been expecting. So I pushed them aside, finished my beer and attempted to use the little kiosk terminal on the bar to tab out, but of course it was not even close to correct so I asked the bartender for my check. She was observant enough to see I didn't eat the wings and asked what was wrong. When I told her they were not extra crispy and a soggy, hot mess she insisted they cooked them ""twice as long"" (so I assume 4 minutes in the microwave instead of 2). But no worries my phenomenal bartender says she will take them off the tab and then hand me a check for two Fat Tire drafts instead of one. When I called her out on that, she got upset and insisted I had two so I said okay, fine how about you call the manager over here for me and she said sure and left the bar.  A few minutes later, a fifty something blond lady shows up, does not even bother to introduce herself and simply says I'm the manager and asks what was wrong. I proceeded to tell her the above experience and her reply was simply "" oh well everybody makes mistakes, what are you asking me for here?"" I mean really? So that's what they taught you to say at Chili's University! Her apathetic, I could care less attitude is all I needed to know to understand just what is going on at this location. Her base, unprofessional attitude made it obvious she has no standards and therefore neither does the staff! So wow, if you have to go to a Chili's and I have no idea why you would, please for the love of God don't go to this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22
Michael C.,"Lubbock, TX",142,275,346,4.0,3/26/2015,"I often meet people here.  They can handle a larger group and there is plenty of variety on the menu.  It is a chain with advertising on the table and cookie cutter atmosphere, but if its not broke don't fix it.  I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=20
Jonathan G.,"Mesa, AZ",18,22,13,3.0,6/16/2014,"Well. Overall I do like this place. They have good food and reasonable prices. However, I wouldn't order any steaks. I do know they are not a steak house and they prove it. First, they cook steaks on a flat top not an open grill which just leaves to sit and cook in its own juices, second, they go by temperature of the meat to tell them when it's done not the feel which is ok if you make sure that the temperature is consistent through out the meat. I have been to a couple of chilis and both the same result. I order medium and it ends up where most of the stake is almost still raw, purple, not just link with blood, raw.  I was told that medium is mostly pink and pointed to the menu that states medium is ""light pink with no traces of red"" so obviously the cooks don't understand the different temperature of meat.  If you order a steak tear it a part. Don't just cut into the center because that will not give you the whole story...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=20

My date accidentally clicked a game and it charges us and our waitress was happy to take it off for us.

Morris K.,"Phoenix, AZ",1172,85,,3.0,12/6/2013,"================== RETURN VISIT UPDATE ================== Came again Thursday night after a meeting I attended with nine other people. It was the same group of people I went with in my first review of this establishment.  The group was seated right away and our drink orders were taken. So why the low rating? Why? Because I ordered the Mango-Chile Tilapia. I took one bite and thought it was terrible. If you've seen my other reviews I normally like Tilapia so it wasn't the fish it was how the fish was prepared. It was cooked fine but the Mango-sauce with avocados on top was not appetizing. At this point everyone in our party was served and enjoying their meals. I was waiting for the waitress to come around and ask if anyone needed refills or how was their food, But she was nowhere to be found. When she finally did come around everyone was just about finished with their meals. Then she asks about how everyone's food was. So I told her. Someone who I assume was a manger comes over and asks if I wanted her to have my meal recooked. At first I said no I just wanted it taken off my bill.. because everyone was already done.  After awhile I reluctantly agreed to having my meal recooked without the mango sauce TO-GO..Upon reflection I should have asked for the meal to be comp'd and be done with it.  FOOD: The food is exactly what you would expect from a Chili's Restaurant. :  SERVICE: I must admit for a large group we did receive good service. PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is OK. AMBIANCE: It's like every other Chili's. CONCLUSION: When this sort of thing happens I don't know about you but it can completely ruin your dinning experience. I mean nothing ruins my mood easier than a poor meal when I'm expecting something much better. How I respond depends on my mood and on the circumstances. I didn't appreciate the waitress not returning to our table for such a long time because this whole experience could have been avoided. . RETURN FACTOR 50-50....%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ******************** 5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business.

The ingredients were fresh: fresh cilantro, fresh beans, gorgeous lime rice. The combinations, moreover, are truly delicious. We also got huge portions. Food Variety: Huge menu.  Service: Waitress could have been a little more attentive. Kept me waiting for a refill of water. However, you can now pay right at your table using a tiny table top computer that makes things extremely easy and fast. It will even print out your receipt. It took a few minutes for them to seat us, even though they were not busy at all. Cleanliness: I did not notice anything bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=20
Larissa N.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,14,,1.0,1/18/2016,Every time we go into this location it takes about 10 minutes to get greeted then a extra 10 minutes on top of that to have a server come by. We decided to give it another shot last week and again nothing has changed. They aren't a busy store at all. I am a server and am appalled to see how this store is ran. The servers take a long time for any type of service as well as refilling and pre bussing. Lazy.. Wont be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=20
Ryan M.,"Phoenix, AZ",37,67,11,2.0,9/20/2015,Place wasn't very great. We had to wait at least ten minutes before we got service and the people who came in 5 minutes after us got served first. My corn on the cob was cold twice and the chicken tenders weren't that great either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=40
Alexia M.,"Peoria, AZ",0,7,,1.0,3/25/2016,"Went to Chili's for lunch with a few friends after school, and we all ordered water and then later my friend decided to order a different drink and the waitress acted as if it was huge hassle. I had asked to have a order of chips and salsa and she turns to me with attitude and says ""So that will be on your bill"". She said you can swipe your card on the little kiosk or cash, and we told her we were paying with cash. Then we had to wait 30 minutes to get our check. Also the chicken crisper's were anything but crispy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=40
Chukki S.,"Phoenix, AZ",95,1020,291,4.0,12/6/2014,"Love their margarita selection!  Service was awesome and I love that they have a card machine at your table, at least in the bar they did.  I counted, and I think there were only like 9 seats at the actual bar here, and then some tables a few booths in the bar.  And obviously many more seat in the restaurant part.  Our food was good, we both had chicken sandwiches.  That entree hasn't changed much since I worked at a Chili's in Seattle back in the 90s.  Their presentation has changed a lot though.  Gone are the cheesy crappy cheap plastic baskets and now the food comes on a nice white plate with a stainless steel crate for the fries.  I will say, for $50 though the dinner didn't fill me up.  I wish they had bottomless fries like Red Robin, or at least gave a bigger portion.  I think there are probably like 16 fries or something.  Kinda cheap for that.  But drinks were good.  Not a great TV set up in the bar so if you're trying to watch sports probably head to Bambinos or Buffalo Wild Wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=40
Lisa M.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,114,29,4.0,7/9/2014,"After not eating at a Chili's for over ten years I decided to give them another try.   Really glad I did.   I have come back at least four times in two months.   Everything I have tried has been surprisingly great.    Items I have ordered on my previous visits include, guacamole and salsa, chicken strips, both original and crispy, fajitas, classic sirloin, ribs, corn, mashed potatoes, spinach and artichoke dip, ""big mouth bites.""   Also, have had their house margaritas and specialty margaritas and they are awesome.   Service has been polite and efficient.  Servers have knowledge of the menu items.  If you sign up for their e-mail club you are periodically sent promotional coupons.    Give them a try.   You will be pleasantly surprised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=40

Cynde G.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,22,10,4.0,9/3/2014,My turkey sandwich was excellent and my husband enjoyed the chicken enchilada soup. His quesadilla tasted good but was sloppily put together.

Alberta M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,2.0,10/19/2015,Our Server was very nice!! But we walked in Sunday to watch the Az Cardinals play ! We walked in the bar and Michael the bartender was wearing a Broncos shirt! The Az Cardinals game was in 2nd Qtr with no sound on ! The sound was on for the broncos game of course ! The broncos game was on 3 tvs on the bar area when there were many games playing and the Cardinals were on one! We were sitting at a booth in the bar area and I asked if we could change the 3rd TV on the broncos game to NASCAR to check the score my server said sure went to Michael and Michael said absolutely NOT!!! As a paying costumer who frequents this location often was appalled and on top of it my chk came out slimy and undercooked after we waited 45 mins for it!!! No way to treat a customer !!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=40
Dani N.,"Glendale, AZ",0,6,1,2.0,7/12/2014,"I recently went to this Chili's for lunch and being lunch it was fairly busy. I ordered the bacon ranch quesadilla and after a couple of bites there was this nasty hard stuff in the quesadilla. My waitress didn't come check on me for a long time so I just sat there making faces. Finally, the manager was checking on the table next to mine, saw my face and asked if everything was alright. I showed him the hard plastic like pieces in the quesadilla and at first he tried to say it was burnt cheese. He leaves to get my waitress after I bang it on the table to show him it's not burnt cheese. The waitress comes over and says ""well what do you want us to do?"". I tell her I just want my bill so I can leave. The only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because when she came back they comped my quesadilla, so I paid for my drink and left and won't be visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=40
Misty M.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,24,,2.0,2/6/2014,"I have frequented this Chili's a couple of times. The very first time I visited I was thoroughly impressed. Our waiter was genuine and so friendly. I have a daughter with special needs and often times when we go out wait staff tends to be stand offish, but not this gentleman. I wish I could remember his name but I did ask for the manager and gave a raving review at the time of our visit. The second and third times I went here I was not as impressed. The wait staff was not nearly as friendly and the last time I went there I seriously felt like my daughter and I were an inconvenience even though we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 20 minutes. The food is always good however, and I will more than likely still return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=40
Angel W.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,4,6,2.0,2/2/2013,I've been to many locations and this one was okay. The food didn't seem to be as good and the staff seemed to be unsure of what they were supposed to do.

Ann B.,"Phoenix, AZ",37,86,1,1.0,12/23/2011,"My husband was worried about my Yelp cred when I told him I was going to write a Yelp review for Chili's, but I told him it was my duty to report our experience. We walked in to Chili's at 6:50 on a Thursday night. Chili's was about half way full. I was actually surprised it was not very busy because it was a couple days before Christmas. Anyway, we decided to sit in the bar area. We sat down and ordered our drinks, 2 nonalcoholics, and a sampler platter. Our drinks took at least 10 minutes. I became a bit nervous because I am pregnant, and I knew I needed food in a timely manner. Our server walked around the bar area as if she were a patron---slowly and without purpose. She didn't speak to us other than to take our order and drop off the check. No convo required, but a check in would have been helpful. She also had almost every table in the bar area, which eventually filled up. Still, no sense of urgency.  The best part of Chili's is the acoustics. We could ease drop on the table next to us without a problem while we waited for our food. We heard the table complaining to the manager that their appetizer was taking forever. I was appalled to hear the manager blame the long ticket time on another table---apparently, another table stole their appetizer! Meanwhile, we are waiting for our appetizer. One appetizer ended up taking 30 minutes. I am not kidding. 30 minutes. When it arrived at 7:35, it was cold and the dressing were warm, meaning the food sat in the window for quite a while, waiting to be run to our table. As we finished our food, the table next to us finally got their food. While I know my review should be about my personal experience, I thought it was pretty interesting that the table next to us had the same level of service we did, but they actually spoke to a manager, twice. We were at this location for about 45 minutes, and the only time I saw the manager was at the behest of this irate table. Chili's is not our normal stomping grounds, and this experience reminds me why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=40
B M.,"Peoria, AZ",0,13,,1.0,8/7/2014,"i have never had such bad service in my life and i have never been so mad about bad service before either. My friend and I decide to go to Chili's for our 1hr lunch break. We arrive at 11am. Within 5 mins of being there we order our food. She orders hers, i order mine, and we order one to go for someone else back at work. We sit there for 45mins without receiving our food before having to track down the waitress (because no one bothered to check on us). We tell the waitress to just bring out food out to-go because now we have run out of time and need to get back to work. 5 mins later we get our food and 2 out of 3 orders are wrong! One was a completely different meal than what was ordered. i ask how long it would take to re-make them and we are told about 17mins. At this point we have 10mins to get back to work. Needless to say, we ended up leaving and going back to work without getting to eat any lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-phoenix-22?start=40
