Diane M.,"Plainfield, IL",0,5,,3.0,8/1/2017,"Two friends and myself went to This chilis and were very disappointed. Been there in the past and liked it, but this time the food was average and the service was terrible. Our bills were all mixed up, even gave me wrong bill when she was supposedly was correcting mine and double charged a friend when she was supposedly trying to fix that too. Will give it another try, but only because it's local.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Ernie F.,"Aurora, IL",0,2,,1.0,12/19/2017,"Buffalo chicken salad was not good. The chicken was cold to the touch and the lettuce wilted. I'm pretty sure the salad was a mistake earlier and they just put it in the refrigerator until we ordered it. Also took a really long time to get served.  The manager was aware of our poor salad but never came out or did any discount on our check.  We are ones to complain, we just won't go back to places like this for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Megan C.,"Chicago, IL",384,53,14,5.0,1/3/2017,"Came in on a Friday night for dinner with my SO. We did the 2 for $22 deal and thoroughly enjoyed the appetizer. We both ordered the Chicken Cajun Pasta as our entree and both came out at the same time. His pasta came out fine, but mine was extra liquidy; at first I just thought it was the juice from the tomatoes but soon I found it unbearable to eat since it was just too wet. The server came by and I voiced my concerns, he was super accommodating and offered to have it remade or for me to order a new entree right away. I chose to get it remade and they had it out ASAP (and the plating was beautiful! They must have done extra quality control on that one!) During my wait, the manager Jeff was super sweet and even offered me a soup or salad while I waited! Jeff also came back another time to make sure that the replacement dish was good (it was perfect). Great location, great management. Would definitely come back again! Dining here was an excellent experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
erika h.,"Plainfield, IL",41,42,5,4.0,5/27/2017,2.5 stars?! Come on! They have a happy hour! We have been regulars the past 2 months. We get a good meal and a couple margaritas and chips and salsa and the bill is reasonable. We signed up for their email club and get free food too. All of the chicken on the light menu is delicious. Good ribs too. It's better than I remember Chilis used to be. The staff is super friendly here too. They do anything for you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Karl R.,"Bolingbrook, IL",31,6,1,1.0,4/28/2016,Nothing like not eating all day placing a online order.  Picking it up getting home opening your order up to find a key ingredient is wrong and not what was requested.   Thanks for ruining my dinner tonight.  Although your gesture of a gift certificate was nice it doesn't fix how I feel in frustration and disappointment.  If I wanted my order wrong I would go to a fast food drive thru.  Simple things go a long way.  Hope my refusal of your offer puts some insight on getting the little things right mean the biggest things to people. Batting 1000% not only was my order wrong as I said.  I find onion peels in it and uncooked onions for half of it!   Awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Mark T.,"Naperville, IL",0,6,1,1.0,4/27/2017,"New bartender here is HORRIBLE!!! Zero personality. Been waiting 10 min for a beer....empty sits at the edge of the bar.  She just looked at me and walked away...... The previous bartenders were way better.  She seems very irritated that people are here... Still waiting..... Oh here comes the manager. Aaaaaand there he goes.... It's depressing here now.  She made eye contact!!! Nope! Nothin... Opening a bunch of bottles of wine seems important!!! Let me close this other guys tab out so he'll leave.... Eye contact!!! Nothin... Still waiting....15 min Finally asked from across the bar if I could get another beer...""sure"" Gee thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Terence W.,"Aurora, IL",106,86,62,2.0,11/12/2016,"Wow has Chilis really dropped off. Ten years ago, this was our go to place for good fajitas, margaritas, and chips and queso. I keep telling myself to stick to small chain restaurant because the food is typically better. So I decided to try and and give Chilis a try because how much can a restaurant drop off? The answer to this question is a lot. First of all, the con queso was terrible. Whenever I eat queso, the color of the dip more yellow than brown. Presentation of food is a big deal to me because I am a visual eater. The queso dip was brown and it looked like it was Sitting under the heater for an extended amount of time. This was the first time I have never finished queso dip. Now on the fajitas, the fajitas took an extremely longtime to come out and when they finally came out, they were hot but not sizzling. Whenever I eat fajitas, I expect them to come out sizzling. Chilies used to be the leader in fajitas. Now they're fajitas are extremely average at best. This is another reminder to eat at small chains because they take pride in the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Yanni B.,"Naperville, IL",5,31,2,5.0,2/22/2016,"I come here with my sister usually on Saturdays when both of our parents are working.  The location is very visually appealing and has a very organized system to ensure the shortest wait time and a great experience. We usually get sat in 5-10 minutes even when it is pretty busy. We always ask for Kaily because she is super sweet and she is very consistent with making sure our orders are perfect and that are drinks/appetizers are doing well! We are never disappointed by her and she gives a very nice impression of the restaurant.  The food is very delicious and we always enjoy getting the big mouth bites and enchiladas. The table side queso is super yummy with tortilla chips with the beef and gooey cheese! Not only that, but the molten lava cake is definitely something to finish off the meal even if you are about to explode. Definitely come down to this location for excellent customer service and great food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Carmela C.,"Plainfield, IL",2,4,,5.0,9/19/2016,"This is one of the best Chilis by far. My daughter and I love going to Chili's on Tuesdays when kids eat free and we always get the molten chocolate cake which is my daughter's favorite, and now that the have the mini ones it makes our visit a success!!! I love the service at this location, we recently moved to the plainfield area and are closer to the Shorewood location then this Plainfield one, but we don't mind making the trip for the service and the food! Thank you chili's!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
John O.,"Naperville, IL",0,25,1,1.0,7/29/2016,I do like Chili's and go a couple times a month  but I had a bad visit at the Plainfield location. The waitress was nice but was clearly not familiar with the drinks or food menu. We thought she was new but she said no. They were missing a significant portion of their coke freestyle flavors and we were told they don't have blenders to make ice drinks?? The service was very slow and our soups came out with the entrees. The food was not bad and was usual good flavor profiles that chilis delivers. I will go to a different location if we go back to chilis at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Mitch R.,"Plainfield, IL",0,4,,2.0,8/9/2016,This place is alright food is always decent appetizer are usually crappy and my drinks are always not refilled typical chilis and what's up with all the emo girls??,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Angela P.,"Aurora, IL",440,1743,13,4.0,11/29/2012,"If you're going to order takeout, call ahead.  Because if you walk in and place a takeout order, you're going to wait a really long time.  And even if you call ahead, you're still going to wait when you get there.  Unless, you know, it took you an hour to get there. I use the takeout service when I'm craving Chili's, but I'm too lazy to go inside and dine in. We've dined at this location several times, and I'm always satisfied with the food and service.  Menu is the same as other Chili's, my favorites being the Sante Fe chicken wrap and the chicken crispers.  The margaritas are $3 on some days, and I love me a mango margarita!  They are very sweet, so if you like your margarita tasting mostly like tequila, you better order something else.  The Corona-ritas are pretty tasty as well, but a little pricey. This place never seems very crowded, and there's fairly attentive service when you dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Jerry D.,"Naperville, IL",0,15,1,3.0,9/23/2015,Went for lunch. I hadn't been there for a long time. I wanted their potato skins only to find out they had taken them off the menu. I had the beef nachos. They were Pretty good. A big order that I could only eat half. Place was clean and not very busy. The person I was with had tacos. You can get much better tacos at Front Street Cantina.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4

Daniel R.,"Naperville, IL",0,65,,3.0,9/13/2015,"Is this place under new management?!  The service was spectacular! Had not been here for a long time because I was tired of the poor service.  But time and location made it a viable option.  So, back we went.  Could not believe how attentive and helpful everyone was.  Keep it up Chili's!!! Three stars instead of four because the portions were small and the prices have gone up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Christina J.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",39,301,34,2.0,2/5/2015,"It's a typical Chili's. I had their fajitas which are not authentic and need to be revamped. My lemonade was good lol. Meh, there are better places to go eat with the family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4
Tania R.,"Lemont, IL",23,18,2,2.0,11/2/2014,Why do I come here? Understaffed is the norm. Service is so slow. Chili's typical menu so no surprises there. Plan more time than you think is necessary.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4

Kevin H.,"Plainfield, IL",8,18,11,2.0,5/1/2013,"Have been eating here for ten years and love it. Until today. Seriously, do not order the loaded potato skins. At least a day old and hard as a brick.

Lisa H.,"Yorkville, IL",43,55,44,4.0,3/5/2016,"Went to this location a week ago. Was not super busy which was nice...around 8pm. Was told a 10 minute wait so went to sit at bar. There was a booth and we started to sit down and a server rudely said ""You can't sit there"". Well, it looked like part of the bar area so wth? We sat at the bar. Bartender very friendly. Got chips & salsa....always great! My frozen strawberry margarita was perfect. Less than 10 minute wait for the booth right on the other side of where we tried to sit which is right by the kitchen. Noise didn't really bother us. Our server was outstanding!!! Fast and super nice!! I had sirloin steak....a bit undercooked for medium and meat was tough but tasted good. Loaded mash delicious with broccoli. My friend had the triple sampler chicken strips, southwestern egg rolls & fried pickles. All were good. Love the egg rolls. Server was very attentive and we left feeling very full!!! I would definitely go back to this location!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20
Lisa M.,"Romeoville, IL",0,14,2,1.0,9/21/2014,"This has to be the worst restaurant I have ever experienced. We waited an hour and 20 minutes and didn't receive our meals.

Andrea M.,"Joliet, IL",3,46,,1.0,3/6/2015,"I had the worst experience ever!!!! I will never return!!!! The waiter was actually super attentive that was not the problem the problem was when it came time to pay my bill I was charged 2 wrong bills!!!! Then I was charged my correct bill. Problem was the two wrong amounts were showing up on my banking mobile the correct amount was not, even at the bank my personal banker pulled up my account and the two wrong amounts were there pending not the correct amount! I called the manager Kevin the next day and he assured me the right amount would debit my account and the two wrong amounts would fall off and then he proceeded to tell me he would send me some chilis coupons for all my trouble!!! It took over a week for the 2 wrong amounts to ""fall off"" & I never got the free coupons for my troubles! So I called him back 2 weeks later & asked about my free coupons & he said he had sent them!? So he took my address again & assured  me he would send me some really good coupons to come in and use at Chili's! A $5 coupon came in the mail and then there was another one stuck to it so it total of $10 in coupons to use at Chili's for a mistake that was $100 and took a week to resolve!!!! That's crazy shit! Not acceptable!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20
Jennifer C.,"Naperville, IL",0,26,,5.0,1/9/2013,"Joanna is the best waitress!!

Lauren T.,"Romeoville, IL",32,215,45,4.0,8/18/2011,"I ate here a few days ago and I was impressed, because the last time I ate at a Chili's I decided I was done with the brand. There were just two of us and we were seated right away in the bar area. There was a booth available, which I appreciated and the bartender was fairly quick at greeting us.  A large Bud Light was only 3.50 and we had a coupon for a free appetizer and opted for the Southwestern Egg rolls. Normally I think they are about 7 or 8 bucks, which may be a bit much but I really like them, so I would probably pay it.  The meal was timed well and we had plenty of time with the appetizer before our meals came out. I had the avocado burger with the black bean patty and it was fantastic. I have heard mixed reviews about their veggie patty, but I was a fan, though a little dry.  The server didn't bug us too much, but she remembered my honey mustard and checked on us enough to bring us what we needed, so kudos to her. With the coupon our meal was about 30 bucks including alcohol, so not bad. They have little self checkout computers on the tables too now, so you can split a check and pay with a card without waiting, which was fun. I think you can use those to order stuff too, even though we didn't use that function.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20
Joedel G.,"Plainfield, IL",23,63,143,4.0,11/9/2011,"I've been here a lot of times. Great experience everytime I come here either dine in or take out. Close to my house and very accessible. The atmosphere is always nice, it's just a happy place. Tex-Mex is one of my favorite cuisine. Don't forget to order the appetizer sampler triple dipper, also try the hot spinach artichoke dip, you won't regret it. A bowl of chili is a must too. For the main entree they have wide selections it's up for you to play around.

It's a Chili's.  The menu is fine. I had the Jalapeno Smokehouse Burger.  This time I didn't fill up on chips and fries.  I actually enjoyed the burger.  I left most of the fries on the plate (although they did taste good).   I'm not going to build it up into something its not, but I had good service and fine food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20
Evelyn B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/3/2014,First time I go I get seated and food served in a timely manner. I get ready to go and no one is to be found. So I check out with their Ziosk and didn't even see the waitress to say goodbye. Second time we finish eating and the same thing happened again! This time I had left overs and wanted a to go box. I had to ask someone at the bar for one. I paid at the Ziosk once again and left. Good thing for the ziosk or else I would be late back from lunch. Third time I phone in my order. I get there 20 minutes later. They look at me like I'm crazy when I go to pick up. Turns out they never be entered my order. Poor service...

Robb L.,"Plainfield, IL",0,20,,1.0,1/28/2010,"Bad food and worse service. I think we finally went there for the last time.  On one occasion we waited for about 15 minutes to get our daughter a refill of a kid's drink. So I finally got up and walked to the bar to have the bartender help me. While standing there, I looked towards the kitchen and saw some food fall off the plate onto the floor. The employee picked up the food and put it back on the plate to be served. Other employees were standing there and said nothing.  Would you go there again after seeing that?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20
Ana W.,"Naperville, IL",0,1,,1.0,2/18/2014,If i could give negative stars I would. Frequent customer at this location. Tonight I visited with my 6-year-old son who left his brand new book behind. Within 20 minutes we called expecting to stop by and pick up the book.  No luck - book is gone and I have a gutted child. The woman I spoke to on the phone didn't even offer to take a phone number and call if it was found. Either the clientele or the staff are a problem.

B W.,"Plainfield, IL",4,371,,2.0,10/15/2011,"Food is good, service is lacking. The reason for giving this establishment a low rating is that it is filthy.  The bar area's seating area is sticky.  The menus which are left at the table are sticky with food particles.  It looks like they never clean them off.  We went from table to table and actually couldn't find one table that was clean.  The food is good, but I will probably never go back.  Never saw a Manager around.  When you come in now one pays any attention to get you seated.  I wouldn't waste my time on this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20
Jill B.,"Plainfield, IL",0,1,,1.0,10/20/2012,"Probably the worst dinner I've ever had at chili's. Not only was our food cold, we had to send it back to reheat it, but my aunts dinner came out 10 minutes AFTER we got ours. They told us they were still cooking it however I've worked in the industry and that means it wasn't put in because you don't bring the order to the table until it's all ready. They had to cook it on the fly.  I realize things happen, but we are extremely disappointed. If I wanted cold food I would've stayed home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20
Dave W.,"Lockport, IL",1,2,2,5.0,7/23/2012,"A friend and I stopped into Chili's one night for dinner, and happened to ask the bartender about catering for about 40 people for my Wife's 40th Birthday Party. The Manager (Nick Brooks) came over and went through the whole menu with us, and gave some great ideas and suggestions. Nick was Polite, Personable, and Professional all at the same time. I arrived at 4:30 on Saturday to pick the food up, everything was hot and ready to go, they even had people there to load everything into my car. The party went off perfectly and the food was a big hit.
