Anastasios E.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,2,1.0,9/30/2016,I went there yesterday (9/29) and ordered the trio grilled fajitas...what I got was fajitas stew..almost a fajitas soup...with terribly soggy tortillas ...total muck for $17.-,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3?start=20
Michaela G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,47,80,4.0,11/5/2014,"The last time I was here, I had some kind of chicken pasta and I was underwhelmed with the flavor. This time I decided to get the rubbed ribs and I was not disappointed. My fries were well seasoned and my ribs were fall off the bone good. Even the sauce was good. I would definitely reccommend them.  The overall look and feel of the restaurant is casual and on my visits, it has always been clean, which I appreciate.  They added a little tablet-like device which allows you to reorder drinks and pay your bill all at the table which is great. Not paying together? You can split the bill.  I used to think of Chili's as a restaurant that I should just pass on by but I may be changing my mind. I may not go out of my way to dine there but I can see myself stopping by every now and again, especially if the ribs are consistently delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3?start=20

The only thing is that it takes awhile for it to come out but otherwise no complaints!

Cynthia M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,8,2,1.0,3/13/2016,"I ordered a steak medium with shrimp with a side of broccoli and asparagus with tomatoes. Unfortunately, approx 45 min later, when we finally got our food, the asparagus was raw, the steak was overcooked and there were no shrimp. Take 2 - 20 min later - the steak was a hickey puck. About 30 min later a manager came over - still without my food and asked if I would still like my meal. At this point my friends had finished their meals some time ago. I left here hungry and disappointed. This was definitely a horrible experience and I won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3?start=20

Andre W.,"Chicago, IL",419,1624,226,4.0,4/14/2013,Stopped in with my colleague as we were hungry after our client meeting.  We grabbed a seat in the bar area at a high top. We were given some chips & salsa which my colleague was surprised as he is a frequent Chilli's visitor and he never gets chips & salsa. Maybe it happened because I was there...lol. Service was great and I ordered some tilapia special they were having for $10.

Frank B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",59,15,1,1.0,6/20/2016,"This was not a good day for this Chilis. When we arrived, the hostess asked if we'd like to sit in the bar area because they had free chips and salsa. We asked if we could have a booth and were told to sit wherever we wanted.  Except, there were no clean booths. In fact, the tables were all dirty. So was the floor. After a long wait, a waitress finally came asked if we wanted chips and salsa and took our drink order. After another long wait, chips and salsa along with our drinks arrived.  We had to ask for plates, something I would assume would be a no brainier. Our order was taken and the food came out without incident. Nothing special, but exactly what I would expect from a chain such as this. During our meal, there was an incident at the front door. Two young women were having an argument with an employee about which I have no idea.  One of the women was getting in the employee's face and talking trash. It was quite a scene.  And it was loud. Other employees starting coming out of the kitchen and from other areas of the restaurant to see what was going on. Finally a patron at the bar called the police.  They took some statements and left without any further excitement.  My wife and I waited again for quite some time before the waitress finally came over and asked me if I knew how to work the machine on the table.  This apparently is how you pay now.  I would give this experience 1/2 a star if I could based on the fact that the food was edible. Otherwise, there was nothing else redeeming about our visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3?start=20
Suzanne B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,,1.0,9/23/2015,"This place is so inconsistent.  I ordered togo food online, get there early to get it while it's still hot but have to wait 20 minutes only to get ice cold food!  Then the manager says, ""tacos get cold quick."" What kind of response is that?  I had been waiting for my food it should have been piping hot.  Then the manager didn't even know what the other item I ordered was?  Who's running the show there?  Obviously the manager is incompetent.  This isn't my first time having a problem there and this same manager didn't do anything to fix the problem.  I thought maybe she's having a bad day the first time, but the second time, she shouldn't be a manager.  Bottom line: don't order togo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3?start=20
Ben A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",48,19,4,1.0,8/20/2015,I had a $5 coupon for chili's so my wife and I ordered 2 cheese burgers medium rare for pickup. When my wife got there she gave the coupon and the manager Jennifer was rude and told my wife we do not take coupons my wife said why wouldn't you take a chili's coupon. Jennifer the manager said we do not take coupons and walked away. My wife ended up paying for the food. When she got home the food was horrible. The burgers where burnt and dry. Which such a rude manager we decided there would be no point in calling to complain about the burgers. We will not come back to this restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3?start=20

Egan B.,"Miami, FL",3,14,2,1.0,9/28/2013,"They burned my fajita toppings and served them to me ANYWAY. Smoke was billowing up in a motherfucking cloud from the serving skillet and was filling the seating area. And, she really, truly said, ""It smells awful and burnt but it's not! I think we just added too much sauce!"" So you're saying your sauce is supposed to smell like burned onions? I'm not sure what you mean. Is that a trademark flavor of Chili's? Burned food? Anyway, the veg was halfway black from the bottom, the meat was overcooked and tasted of burnt veg and she says, ""Well, we can replace the vegetables and keep the meat since it's not burned!"" Yeah, fuck the customer. Because Chili's can't afford to toss half a chicken breast and 4 shrimp. Anyway, I asked whether the bar had Drambuie. She checks and comes back with, ""No, we're out of Jamboree."" Bless her heart.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3?start=20

Cherine A.,"Coconut Creek, FL",734,675,663,1.0,7/28/2009,"I came here last night with a group of 8 people. I've never been a fan of Chili's, but I thought I might as well give it another shot. I looked through the menu for what felt like an eternity... I kept flipping back and forth trying to find something that sounded remotely appetizing and wasn't deep fried. The person next to me had the exact same problem. She ordered the chicken caesar salad, while I opted for the 8 oz. sirloin and corn on the cob. Everyone else ordered something fried (and fried foods make up 90% of the menu). Once my steak came out, I didn't even have to take a bite to realize it was going to be one very bad meal. The meat looked like a slab of very dry beef jerky, and had the consistency of shoe leather. I managed to cut (no, saw) some of it, but only choked down a few pieces before just giving up on it. I turned to my corn on the cob, and asked for some butter. The waiter brings me a small container of clear-looking liquid that appeared to be vegetable oil. I asked him if he had any non-melted butter, and he said this was all they had. So I poured the ""butter"" on and ate it, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to know what it actually was. The only thing that made this meal somewhat decent was the company, since we had a good time talking. But it's a bad sign when I leave a restaurant hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3?start=40

Colleen C.,"Portland, OR",156,259,3,3.0,1/15/2011,"Like the previous poster, I'm not particularly pleased with the disproportionate selection of deep fried foods that Chili's offers.  However, I am a huge fan of their 2-for-1's, and after 3 Long Islands, I would probably eat whatever they put in front of me.   As far as appetizers go, their skillet queso is absolutely incredible.  On account of the aforementioned drinks, I'm not exactly sure what I got as a meal, but it was some sort of spicy sandwich that interfered with me drinking more Long Islands because they tasted gross together, but I'm sure it'd be fine on its own.   This Chili's is also great because they will sing really loud and embarrassing if it's somebody's birthday, which indeed it was.  The birthday boy looked absolutely mortified throughout the singing, so I consider it a complete success.  Not a big fan of Chili's in general, but I have no complaints about this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3?start=40

I wasn't really a fan of Chili's in general but lately I've been seeing myself come here more often. It's your typical standard Chili's with a large parking lot. This is located in the busy plaza, The Fountains. I love their drink specials, they offer two for one prices on certain drinks (wine, beer, cocktails). I really like their Thursday deal, $5 Presidente margarita. The margarita was so delicious and the drink yields about three glasses (it comes in a shaker). I also really like their chile-lime chicken and rice entree; that is so flavorful with a nice kick to it, it's also on the healthier side. The bar area is usually packed so we always opt for a booth. Our server was always checking up on us and making sure our drinks were filled.

Be sure to ask for customization, to replace your stale chips, and ask for extra service if you are picky when it comes to service, they will work with you. The manager will gladly come out to address your concerns. I actually like Chilli's menu and choices. It gives you enough options, for any taste. Dont expect above and beyond from anyone at this location, this is perhaps due to their internal culture at the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3
Paula R.,"Clearwater, FL",215,19,51,3.0,12/8/2017,"I was a little upset because Chili's recently changed their menu and got rid of my favorite dish...the margarita chicken bowl (I get it without chicken to make it plantbased) but they didn't have it. The waitress though was helpful and suggested the chipotle chicken bowl without the chicken and it was good but was too spicy for my taste (I don't really like spicy).

Howard H.,"Dania Beach, FL",533,459,3161,3.0,4/10/2016,"We came here after my wife's dentist appointment.  We normally go to the the location near our house for drinks and snacks.  They have 2 for 1 all day so it's always happy hours there.  O, since we are already close by, having lunch here seems logical. All the Chilis looks exactly the same, and we found ourselves grabbing two stools at the bar immediately.  First things first, get the 2 for 1 drinks going.  I ordered a draft beer and I noticed that the size of the beer mug they served me is a bit larger than the Chilis near our house.  Or maybe I am imagining things but it sure feels like it.  And my wife ordered her usual Long Island Ice Tea.  She felt it wasted a little bit different than she used to, but said the second drink was a bit strong. For lunch, we ordered a few different appetizer items.  Started off our favorite Southwest Egg Rolls.  The dish came warm and crispy.  We only got Big Mouth Bites instead of three we get at the other place, which seemed odd.  We also got some onion rings and an order of Classic Nachos.   In this visit, All the  food tasted fine.  Our bartender was pretty good and provided excellent service.  The only thing we were not thrill about is their table top tablet.  We paid our bills through it but then we noticed it automatically charged us $1.99 ""entertainment"" fee.  It took a lot of hassle to get that taken out of our tab.  So be careful and always check your bill, even if it's $1.99.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3

As i sit here and write this the table next to me is talking about how bland their food is. LOLOL.... I was in a hurry so I didn't sent the food back but it was cold. Isn't there a manager in these chains that just handles making sure ALL the dishes come out perfect? So what if it's a mediocre restaurant chain? That shouldn't matter, should it?

He recommended a Presidents Margarita with black cherries. It was to die for. There were lots of customers that seemed to know each other. I was told by one guy he comes here every week and gets something new made by Glen each time. I ate eggrolls and they were pretty good. Glen made  me try the spicy Santa Fe sauce. He called it Santa Clause sauce so that I would remember the name.... hilarious. The manager walked by and was asking people if everything was ok. I thought that was cool.

She was attentive and helpful. The food was what you would expect from a Chili's. Most of the appetizers are fried foods however, I did enjoy the Southwestern egg rolls. I had the bacon avocado sandwich and found it to be good. If you've been to a Chili's you're likely familiar with the experience. Only real complaint is that they are utilizing a hand held device at the table for pretty everything your waitress typically does.

Lisa R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",76,81,377,5.0,11/25/2015,"Chili's has really worked hard to upgrade its menu via customer feedback. Looks like it has worked! The place was packed when we came in on a fun weekend day! Everyone, [customers] had their favorite team shirt on, and all the while trying to yell louder than the next person! Lol!! This was electric energy! We found a place to sit and commence our fun too. It is 2 for 1 Happy Hour all the time we are told and they have Kiosks on the tables like many other restaurants.  If you sit in the bar chips & salsa are Always Free if you just ask! We actually abstained! I know right!! Appetizers are 1/2 price. We wanted to try their enchiladas. No judging please! This is S FL and pretty much Mexican food is non- existence, so why Not! Well let me tell you we pleasantly Surprised! Bottomless Enchiladas choices to begin are chicken with cream sauce or green chile verde. Ground beef w a red sauce. We both chose chicken and cream sauce and the verde! White meat chicken breast seasoned deliciously rolled in corn tortillas with cheese and covered in the sauces with cilantro rice and choice of beans. Bean choices; pinto or black. We both got black and these were fantastic! Tender, seasoned and made with tlc! The rice was fluffy with the delicious cilantro all stirred through. They hit the mark with this for sure! Wowzers! I remembered I had a glass of wine lol, n sipped it. Sam Adams Lager for my love. Aahh! Chili's congrats on the new items on the menu!  Our server Ashley was attentive and checked back at just the right times with a smile. The employee atmosphere was warm and cheerful. I certainly felt they enjoyed being there and wanted all the customers smiling. Chili's Keep the prices reasonable and the great choices on tap and happy hour! Oh!

Janae D.,"Plantation, FL",0,3,,5.0,4/10/2017,I was looking for a good place that serves happy hour and boy did I find it. From the phenomenal service to the amazing drinks. J.T. Is by far the best bartender I've ever had serve me. He managed to have a great conversation all while mixing drinks (which were mixed to perfection!). I really enjoyed myself.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3
Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",937,1412,6952,4.0,11/16/2013,"My favorite go-to lunch spot. First things first. The hostess. I've never met someone who truly seems like they love their job the way she does. And if she doesn't then this woman needs an Emmy. Every time I go there I'm greeted by this woman who treats her customers like they are family. It's amazing. You know, another thing I love? BOGO drinks. The adult kind. Any place that gives me a margarita for free after I order one AND it tastes great. Major points in my book. The service is always good; having polite and attentive waitstaff. I never find myself having an issue with anything. The food arrives quickly and always how I wanted it to be. The food itself is standard Chili's grub. If that's what you want, then you'll be pleased. The endless chips and salsa are my favorite as is the guacamole burger. Oh yeah, and the quesadilla salad, that's if you need a few items to help make your selection easier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plantation-3
