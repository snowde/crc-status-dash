Rebeca F.,"Pocatello, ID",3,13,23,3.0,12/2/2015,"We were seated quickly however we had to wait a few minutes before our server came to take our drink order.  I ordered the tilapia with mango salsa, the tilapia itself was pretty tasty, but it came with rice and the rice was very hard, it was a clear light brown color, I don't think it was cooked all the way, I couldn't chew through it.   When our server checked on us I mentioned that the rice, he apologized and brought out another plate with rice, that rice looked and tasted much better better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Sam M.,"Pocatello, ID",89,57,,4.0,5/24/2017,"Chillis gets slammed too much. I think the food is great.  My brother and I kept getting things and two margaritas and it was only 40 and we ordered 5 things. Honestly, I guess it depends on the day but our staff was great",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Lonnie H.,"Pocatello, ID",0,3,,5.0,6/1/2017,Great food the jalapeño mac n cheese is the best. The watermelon margarita is top notch. The staff was friendly and helpful. Stays open late that's a plus. Great location and the desserts are yummy too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Doug P.,"Hayward, CA",43,93,15,3.0,2/18/2017,"We stopped in for lunch on our drive from Elko, NV up to West Yellowstone, WY. Since they were located right next to the Costco made it an easy choice. Fuel the car at Costco then fuel ourselves. Service was good and pretty quick. Food was as expected. I had a sandwich they girls had some surf and turf. No complaints from anyone was heard. I've had bad experiences with other locations of this place but the Pocatello location made up for past encounters. This one I would return to, the others, well...not so much. Aside from all that it was an average dining experience and very slow for and early Monday afternoon. Parking is was sufficient as we found a spot right up front. It was pretty cool inside too. Nice to me since outside was over 90 as I recall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Angie W.,"South Jordan, UT",181,4,,1.0,7/27/2016,Most horrible Chilis I've ever been to. The waitress brought our appetizer and then asked for our sugar dish that was already filled to fill it more and stood right at our table and continued to fill the sugar dish... REALLY?!!! Our food was served and my prime rib tacos were cold & tasted like it was processed meat.. Yuck! We should of went to Red Robbin.. Luckily we were just driving thru this town cause I would never go back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Bill J.,"Nevada City, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/23/2016,"We are a long time fan of the Chili's chain.  But a drawback has always been inconsistency from one location to another.   However this Pocatello location absolutely stands out as being the all around WORST of any of their chain in 15+ states we have visited.  Terrible quality of food,  very slow service despite being 80% empty at 12:30 on Friday (that should have given us a clue),  indifferent attitude of wait staff.  We should have sent all four meals back, but as we were already behind on our trip we left most and moved on.  Cheese quesadillas were burned, the salad shown on the menu as overflowing with beans, corn, cheese instead arrived as mostly out of date browned iceberg lettuce.   ANY joint in Pocatello has to be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Brian G.,"Pocatello, ID",2,1,,1.0,6/19/2016,Food is standard but the lack of organization and poor customer service were extraordinary. I topically like Chili's but here I would say ditch it and go to Red Robbin!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
R K.,"Pocatello, ID",0,25,,1.0,10/31/2015,"Ouch! Every restaurant may have a bad day. However, when we were served ""FAJITAS "" consisting of soft mushy peppers, chicken and pork appearing to have been boiled and all cooked at different times, and steamed broccoli, all without any  hint of flavor (""Chilis"" perhaps) this might have been forgiven. Our meal was accompanied by an uncaring surly wait staff and a manager whose response was ""that's how we always serve it here"" without any apology for this culinary miscarriage.  Can't say that we will ever  be back. We were not charged for the meal but the attitude of the staff really tainted our experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Bob R.,"Pocatello, ID",0,5,,1.0,2/14/2016,"Service was great, chips were a bowl of cold grease with a few pieces of tortilla,,,, I mean the worst after asking for replacement chips nearly as bad.  The so called queso dip.....sucked, i would not take my dog here....again server was awesome not her fault they serve dog food.  Do not eat here...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Gail J.,"Inkom, ID",0,51,19,4.0,8/22/2015,Good consistent food. Service excellent and very friendly.  Very clean restrooms   Great moist turkey burger and wonderful flat bread chicken Chipolte sandwich.  Salad and dressings great.   Consistently good food choice especially when we are on the road.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Casey S.,"Boise, ID",36,20,14,2.0,8/28/2014,I've been to chilies many times. I have to say they let me down tonight. Cody was my server and he was great. However I ordered the short rib enchiladas. It was below par. I go to Chilies because I can normally count on their consistency. Not tonight.  My enchiladas weren't hot or even warm all the way through. The short ribs looked like they were marinated in the picture but were plain as could be in my enchiladas.  I know the food is rarely like the picture but this was a huge difference.  Needles to say I do not recommend Chilies in Pocatello. :( I did get the cookie with ice cream and loved that!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Aaron L.,"Preston, ID",0,3,,2.0,6/5/2016,"I've been to previous chili's before and service there was pretty decent, but here our waitress not only spent ten minutes getting or drink, but she gave us sour coffee and dirty cups, we told her about it, so she went to get a new drinks but she didn't grab our old drinks.  There were only 8 other tables and yet food still arrived 45 minutes after we ordered.  The waitress was very polite, I personally suspect she'd been undertrained.  The food was decent but waiting 45 minutes for food that lasted ten, I personally won't be here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Donna M.,"Nampa, ID",54,11,4,5.0,9/26/2015,"We were in town visiting our daughter for her birthday so decided to have dinner at Chili's.  Service was excellent and the food was also really good. I highly recommend it.  Our server, Audra was excellent. Very attentive and extremely friendly.  Manager and host also were friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Greg T.,"Pocatello, ID",17,63,23,1.0,3/17/2015,"Short rib enchilada were nothing but gristle.  Not very busy, but service was still slow.  Very disappointing experience.  Save time and money go to a fast food joint.  The manager acknowledged there has been a standing issue with the ribs. WHY WOULD YOU CONTINUE SERVING FOOD THAT YOU KNOW IS SUBPAR?!?!?  This place is hoping you won't notice and you eat their discount ribs in the name of profit. On a bright note they did not charge for the food we waited a half hour not to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Charley C.,"Atascadero, CA",788,2333,3548,4.0,7/17/2011,We saw a movie and went to chili's and the finals for the womens world cup was in the final half hour. Wow what a game! and the service was hustling and getting back to all the tables with great ease. The Bacon burger was good (had to split it with someone after the movie - can you say toooo much popcorn) Good and respectable especially for a big nationwide chain,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Kassiah W.,"Idaho Falls, ID",66,142,61,3.0,7/30/2013,"The food wasn't amazing, but it wasn't terrible. The wait-service was nice, but the waiter kept forgetting to refill our drinks. Their salsa isn't bad, but their beans are too salty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
Full F.,"Cleveland, OH",0,12,8,3.0,2/4/2013,"The food was good, but our service was fabulous. This was our first visit to Chili's and our waitress Amber was fantastic as was her group who helped with dinner/refills etc. Portion size for all four entrees were large and two of us took home leftovers. The lime chicken with potatoes and broccoli was delish!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pocatello
