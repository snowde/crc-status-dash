Amanda K.,"Pooler, GA",24,54,40,2.0,4/2/2014,"The only reason this is even getting 2 stars is because our waiter, Tyler, was nice. He was forgetful and not very helpful, but mice.  My family and I were less than impressed with this Chilis. We waited of over an hour for food! That alone is enough to make you mad but when waiting with your child, it makes it worse.  The food was excellent. No complaints there. I had a pomegranate margarita that would rival any real bar. That's it for the pros.  Our food was very slow, first drinks came out extremely watered down. We sent them back. They came back fresh and good. After waiting for such a long time for food, our server was attentive. However while waiting he certainly made himself scarce. Out attentive server was pretty forgetful and we saw him multiple times chatting away with co workers while sitting down when we were waiting on ketchup and drinks (water).  Unfortunately this visit resembles our last visit to Chilis where we waited a ton and were displeased. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me! We won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20
Mike L.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,87,2,3.0,10/1/2014,This location is getting better with constancy but still not the Chilis I've grown to love over the last decade.  Service and food can vary from day to day. Happy hour is awesome with 2 for 1 drafts.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20
Madison P.,"Bowling Green, KY",11,231,152,3.0,3/12/2014,"Friday Night dinner out. The Long Island Ice Tea is delicious.  I ordered the Mango-Chile Tilapia.   I asked the waitress if it was overly spicy.  She suggested I have the sauce on the side.  The sauces are really spicy. The fish was OK, a bit overdone around the edges.  Glad I took her advice.  The broccoli was cooked to perfection.  It was bright green and still had a bit of a crunch. My husband ordered rib eye steak and fully loaded mashed potatoes.  He said the steak was good but not the best around town.  He didn't like the potatoes.  I tasted them and thought the added ingredients were over the top. I ordered the Triple Dipper Appetizer  which had boneless buffalo wings, southwestern egg rolls, big mouth bites/2 slider burgers.  It came with the standard ranch dressing for the boneless wings.  I couldn't eat the egg rolls the filling was too spicy for my taste.   I think it is a great idea that you can pay at the table via an electronic screen with your card.  If you have kids they can play games as long as you are there for 99 cents.   The one thing that really put me off was that when I hit the amount for my husband to swipe his card I stopped him  because either the waitress, manager or the machine is preset for a 20% tip.  I understand that the majority of a waitress's pay comes from tips.  However, i don't like anyone assuming I want to give 20% or anything.  I thought our server was adequate not good.  So I put it down to 15%. When I get really good service I give 25%.  I tip according to the Quality of Service I receive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20
Jordan L.,"Savannah, GA",9,97,9,2.0,5/3/2014,"I have been here a couple times, and I would venture to say that I will probably go back knowing what I am getting for the price that I am paying. The bar setup is awesome. They have huge tv's, and they have great beer/happy hour specials. The weekend bartender is friendly, although I wouldn't go in if she was not working. They advertise that they always have BOGO drinks, although it is very deceiving because they give you very small beer mugs. Although you are getting BOGO, you are drinking out of a 10oz mug rather than a 12/16oz mug. They happy hour food specials aren't bad, although the food takes forever to come out. I can't give this place a 1-star because it is not terrible, although it could definitely be much better. This is a place that I would go for a late night beer after the other happy hour specials end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20
Brian E.,"Bluffton, SC",28,3,4,2.0,8/16/2015,Stood at the hostess stand for 4 minutes before we encountered our first employee (with food in her mouth).  Sat at our table about 7 min before a server told us she would be back to take our order...just generally bad/slow service.  330 in the afternoon and while it was not busy over half the tables were covered in dirty plates and lazy girls that lolly gag and walk past them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20
Eric R.,"Savannah, GA",19,14,6,4.0,2/21/2014,"I went with my lady tonight. This place looks amazing for a chain. I ordered the full rack of ribs dry rubbed which comes with cinnamon apples and fries. This was super good very surprising. My fiancé ordered the 10 oz sirlon which comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli. She said it was very good. She also ordered the corn on the cob on a stick. She said it was good but to much pepper. The wait staff was quick and only made one mistake they gave us water instead of sweet tea. They have a little computer on ur table and u can play 1 dollar games on it while u wait order more drinks appetizers and pay for ur food. Awesome. The floor was super slippery though not sure why. So everything positive other than slippery floors, error in drink, and the time the between order placed and food served took a while.

Ally C.,"Ashburn, VA",116,11,2,2.0,5/31/2015,"Chili's is one of my husbands favorite restaurants and since there is not one near where we live we go when we travel. We stopped at this Chili's on our drive home from vacation, side note we ate twice at Chili's in Florida and both times were great! When we arrived at this location the hostess was a bit rude and pushy, we had just traveled 5 hours and she wanted us to sit on lounge my husband asked for a booth and she rolled her eyes and said what ever, the restaurant had only a handful of people so I was very confused. We ate got our drinks and order the queso, when we got the queso it looked odd and then I tasted it a realized it was just meat and no cheese! We told the waitress and her response was she couldn't help and that's just how it is... We had ate a Chili's two days prior and the queso was delicious and CHEESY! That by far is my biggest complaint, my husbands entree was fine other then them forgetting he ordered fries instead of rice. I order the mango chicken and it looked gross and was too spicy... I will continue to eat at Chili's just never that location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20

Adam P.,"Manassas, VA",139,6,3,1.0,3/6/2016,"Just hopped off 95 for some dinner. You'd think you could rely on a chain restaurant, considering they have a set system handed down from corporate. This place has a couple loose screws. Server got our drinks quickly with a refill close behind, chips and salsa as well. When it came time to order our server looked at my girlfriend as if she had two heads. Once we got our orders in we didn't see our server until he delivered the food. He sat down a plate of enchiladas, black beans, and rice. Clearly all have been microwaved the tortilla shells were tough and rubber throughout and hard at the ends. The edge of the plate had burnt on bean sauce that couldn't be whipped off with a wet napkin. This was the dirtiest plate I've ever seen. My plate was shrimp tacos a scoop of rice and cup of black beans. Everything was cold.  The shrimp was over cooked and rubbery. Seemed like the whole plate was taken out of the fridge. Server never came back to ask how the food was so we flagged down another server and asked if it was supposed to be cold and it wasn't. She took it back saying they will get it fixed. No apologies. Our server came back after a minute or two and said it was being fixed. I had lost my appetite by then and told him I didn't want it anymore. He simply said okay and ran off with nothing to say and no apologies. Waited for my girlfriend to finish her plate paid the check at the on table kiosk after the discount was made to the check and left. He didn't deserve the $2 we left for tip. We do not recommend this place at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20
Kyle C.,"Pooler, GA",1,24,,2.0,8/16/2014,"Wife and I went on a Thursday night, waited about 15 minutes to be seated in what seemed to be a pretty empty restaurant. Got seated, had a pleasant server that took our drink orders and brought them out. While waiting on her to come back so we could order, we both needed refills. The server was no where we could see, so we flagged down a different server to ask if we could bug her for a refill, which she kindly obliged.  Ordered food finally, ribs and a medium steak and guacamole for my wife. Guacamole was great, ribs were good, but the steak was way overcooked. Annoying, but not a HUGE deal. So I asked the server if I could have one made as I ordered it. Waited another twenty minutes and she brought out a thick steak, asked me to check it out. I cut in to it and it was beat red. The server took a step back and put her hand over her mouth. I thought she was laughing at first but she was actually gagging. It was literally just seared on the outside and completely raw inside. I asked for the manager.  He came out after ten minutes, I explained the issues, patiently. (No point in being a dick) he listened and then apologized, then started to bash his cooks, bash his servers and trash talk how corporate had messed up this location or whatever. I put my hand up and said"" I don't need to hear all of this. I dont need an explanation or excuse and it really bothers me that this place is managed by someone who would so quickly throw his people under the bus. I'd just like to leave I'll pay for the guacamole and drinks but that's it."" He said ok and adjusted the bill accordingly. My wife and I left and still ripped the server on what the tab would have been.  Very sad that management would throw their people down like that, poor service or not.  I would not recommend this location chilis for anyone to go to, at least for another few months tilt hey sort out their issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20

Amanda H.,"Pooler, GA",18,20,6,2.0,3/23/2014,"It seems as though some of the other diners had the same issues we did when dining at this Chili's. My fiance and I really like Chili's and were happy that one was opening up in Pooler. We went for lunch and once we were seated, it seemed to take forever for someone to approach us to take a drink order. We actually almost left and then our waitress finally stopped by. We put in our order and then waited.....and waited.....and  waited. After a while, the manager came by and asked us what we ordered. We told him what we ordered and he left. Then......we waited, and waited and waited. He came back again and apologized for the wait and said the waitress had put our order in incorrectly. We said that's ok and again....you guessed it...waited for quite a while. FINALLY our order comes and sadly, it was lukewarm. We didn't say anything because who knows how long it would have taken to get it heated up. Our waitress comes by when we are almost done eating(we hadn't seen her since we initially put our order in) and asked if we wanted a refill of water. His water was about half way full and mine was still full so we said no. Then she comes by a couple minutes later and says something like she hates not giving him more so she goes ahead and refills his cup. He didn't drink any of it the rest of the time we were there so that was pretty much a waste.  Unfortunately, this was probably my worst experience eating at a Chili's and from reading some of the other reviews, it will not be our first choice if we are wanting something in the area vs. heading into Savannah.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20

I mean, what are the workers doing??  Once I sat at the table, waited about 10 min till I could not even deal with sitting and not even have a cup of water.

J W.,"Keller, TX",11,3,1,1.0,3/18/2014,"Low score because the blonde bartender was obnoxious on the night we were there. The waitress was pretty nice, she tried to make it better and make up for her lack of desire to serve beer at 11:01pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20

Tom L.,"Savannah, GA",0,3,,2.0,6/16/2014,"My wife & I had given this new location several visits and all have been poor visits. The wait to order, once seated can be forever (our last visit was 33 minutes, just because we wanted to see how long it would take this time). The food quality isn't up to par with other Chili's that we have been too. When the food arrives at a reasonable time, it is generally acceptable, when it takes its usual, longer time, it is usually the wrong order or cooked incorrectly, or my favorite, COLD! And the table tablets, where you can order drinks and pay your bill, well nice touch Chili's, they default to 20% tip !! which is easy to overlook We really want this location to improve, but it will be a while before we go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20

Laura M.,"Pooler, GA",0,17,2,4.0,6/24/2017,"Yes, I saw the lukewarm reviews for this location; but since I've always had pretty good luck with this chain, we gave it a whirl on a busy Saturday night when all the newer, trendier places were packed.  Seated immediately even though they were briskly busy, the server delivered drinks and took our order promptly. One of us had the Triple Bites- a nice combo of 3 appetizers. The other had prime rib tacos. They were served in less than 10 minutes, hot, fresh, and with the little extras we requested. Both were delicious, the server was friendly but not obtrusive, and we got drink refills without having to flag someone down.  This, overall, was a pretty darn good experience. The prices are reasonable, and the selection is plentiful. The only knock is twofold: the menu is a little overwhelming, and they - like a lot of restaurants - oughta have a 'family' section so the little monsters/kiddos could squeal & run around separately from the rest of us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler

William K.,"Savannah, GA",36,142,290,3.0,10/10/2015,"I've been here a few times since it opened a couple of years ago.  Each time I leave I remember why it is so long between my visits.   The menu is pretty good, but to me its one of those things where the description sounds better than it actually tastes.   The service is generally slow but last night it seemed worse than in the past.  There was no wait at 6 pm on a Friday night, could be because there are plenty of better options or everyone has caught on to the fact that yelp rates this place at 2.5 stars.   And as if the server needs another reason not to return to see how you are doing they have these machines at the table where you can see your bill and pay with a CC (tip defaults to 20%, haha).  On this same machine you can play some games to pass the time while you wait 30 mins for the food to come out, the catch its $.99 to play them.  Figured they would be free to play, but I guess that would be asking for too much.  If your're a Chili's fan and gotta have it then your decision has already been made.  If you are on the fence and want this Tex-Mex style there is the fan favorite Moe's and Jalapeno's adjacnet, Chipotle is right down the street as well.  I've been to these a bunch of times, never disappointed.  You can thank me later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler

Rare, and when I cut into it, it was raw, not even rare.  So I checked another section and it was the same.  So I brought it up to the waiter and he said that he would get me another one and apologized profusely.  The manager brought out the plate and I noticed it was the same steak with the same cut marks and piece cut off.  I immediately asked him if this was the same steak, and his reply was yes, ""that's how we do it here"".  As he walked away, my daughter and wife saw him look at our server and swipe his hands together in a cleaning motion and smile.  Not sure what is going on here, but I'll say this, we won't be back to this place ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler

Trust me this is the best chain restaurant in pooler. No place is perfect, but chilis does their best to fix their mistakes. I have never had a problem here, unlike Logans or cheddars. The Buffalo wings are the best. Better than Buffalo Wild Wings I think. Every time I order a steak it is always cooked to medium rare perfection.

RoverTreks T.,"Green Cove Springs, FL",2,129,52,4.0,1/17/2015,"Recommended. We're visiting Chili's for the first time in several years.  A previous unpleasant experience has kept me from visiting. Our visit to this place was a nice surprise.  The restaurant offers a superb environment, good food, and the latest hi-tech terminals right at the table. Our group had the Fire-grilled Corn Guacamole, around $5.  It was excellent, as were the chips. All of us ordered the steak fajitas, $12,99.  They were very good.  A picture of their steak fajita entree is below. Give this place a try.  It's very good. p.s.  If you haven't visited the Pooler area recently, take exit 104 off of I-95 and take a look around.  It's one of the fastest growing areas in the greater Savannah area.  Shopping malls and new restaurants are springing up all over the place regularly.  This restaurant is in the shopping mall on the right just past the Home Depot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler
Erik S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/12/2016,"Being that this is my third time being here I hoped to have a different experience than the last two. Well I was dead wrong. At first glance this seems like a nice clean establishment, until you take a look into the details. The waitresses do not know the menu, I have witnessed one woman read off the menu to the customer. Service horrible, food below average, cleanliness will make you want to vomit. Take your money and head to one of the other restaurants in Pooler. I can't even pretend like this chilies is decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler
Gary S.,"Pooler, GA",0,2,,1.0,7/17/2016,The service was ok. Served a salad that was suppose to have black beans and corn but had none. Manager said they were out. Should not have served it without telling us first. Manager said I will discount your bill. $2.40 discount. Will not return to this restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler
Angela S.,"Bloomingdale, GA",22,11,,3.0,3/23/2014,Service has improved so much as well as kitchen times!  Food is pretty consistent. I would stay away from the salmon. Completely full of bones the last time I ordered it. I get fish has bones but I've never encountered bones in salmon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=40
Danielle H.,"Jonesville, LA",1,7,2,2.0,7/15/2015,"Soooo it started off good. Waiter was very nice. Took are orders quickly. Then it started going down hill from there. My cousin asked for the chicken chipotle flatbread what she got was chicken and chipotle. So by the time she got hers everyone else was done. The manager brought it out and she got it free. We order the Texas cheese fries for our appetizer but it was missing the jalapeño we had to ask twice for them. I notice that the table next to ours was missing theirs also so the cook must not have known that it's suppose to be jalapeños. So my mother ordered a burger cut the sauce add mayo and instead of fries she wanted a salad. They brought her fries and we had to ask a total of 4 times for her salad. The burger was missing the mayo. The waiter asked my aunt if she would like cob or kernel corn my aunt replied kernel, he repeated kernel and yet still brought cob and said he heard cob. Well we chopped it up to maybe he was new so we would forgive all of the mistakes and we laid a pretty hefty tip down, but on returning with our checks my aunt gave him a $50 bill for a meal that cost 20 something and he brought her out $2. So she told him of this mistake and he says you have me A 30. My aunt replies please check your register because I gave you one bill which was a 50 they do not make $30 bill sweetie. So he goes to the back to check and the manager brings out her correct change and says that the waiter made a mistake and asked him to bring it back out.  I also noticed that the family next to us were having issues also. Food was good but service not so much but he may have been new or having an off day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=40
Elaine M.,"Richmond Hill, GA",0,3,,1.0,3/15/2016,"Seriously?! One would think they (chili's) would have it down by now..from the time we walked through the door to the relief we felt leaving and confirming the unspoken misery we endured for ""lunch"".  We were shuffled into the bar as we were told by the hostess our service would be very slow otherwise. We waited what seemed to be an eternity to be greeted but in actuality it was 8 minutes, thanks to my lengthy conversation with my boss, via text to confirm the time. Ordered a tea and water, believe me when I tell you I would have done anything for a margarita to ease the pain of waiting..we hastily ordered Texas cheese fries which were a glob of half melted cheese on soggy sad cold fries. My fajitas came later with barely a sizzle and semi raw bell peppers. And as the server set them down declared they were over cooked. I didn't care I was famished and couldn't wait any longer. My husbands sad little over cooked steak was laying lifeless on his plate.. Do they put pictures on the menu to tease us? When I got up to use the restroom I realized no one was in the restaurant.. The bar had all the patrons on this particular afternoon. I struck up a conversation with the waitress to discover the regional manager had just left.. What was it like when he was there? Was this the best they had to offer? Just confirmed it is tastier, cheaper, more fun to stay home! I will take some time to get over the disappointment and waste of time it was to try to have lunch at Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=40
Catherine H.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,11,,3.0,2/22/2014,"Currently sitting at the new chili's, we ordered southwest eggrolls about 50 mins ago, and still don't have them. While the staff is very friendly, the wait is nuts!!! As I'm writing this, our food arrived...still no eggrolls! 2 ladies who ordered before us, don't have their food! Insane wait! Hope they get it together soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=40
Kevin K.,"Pooler, GA",233,4,,1.0,11/30/2014,Given them numerous chances. You can tell that poor management trickles down in this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=40
Robert T.,"Pooler, GA",0,3,,1.0,4/13/2014,"The food is good and that's the only reason it's getting one star.  The service is horrible, if you are ever able to get in and get a seat, expect to wait at least 10 minutes to even get your order taken.  Then, expect to wait another 30 minutes to even get your food.  The servers and bartenders are more interested in socializing with their friends and care more about the people that they know that are customers than they do about other customers.  I've been there a few times and each time, it took forever to get my food.  The excuse each time was that they claimed to be backed up.  However, the customers that the servers/bartenders know that came in after I did, got their food before I did and actually paid and left before I even got my food.  This last time was the last straw.  I went in for lunch and surprisingly got my order taken very quickly.  However, I sat and watched as the server greeted and socialized with customers she knew, then brought them their food, then watched as those customers left before my food had even been delivered.  I got the same excuse I always get, ""We're backed up.""  As I said, they're more concerned with socializing and the bartenders are more interested with flirting and gossiping in the corner than they are doing their jobs. There are plenty of other excellent restaurants in the area, I recommend going to one of those.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=40
K C.,"Pooler, GA",0,5,1,2.0,4/3/2014,Location new & clean however the time management was very poor. We ordered appetizer and didn't receive it for 35 minutes. The food even longer. The food was great but won't be going back for awhile and hoping they get their kitchen more organized.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=40
Sally G.,"Bloomingdale, GA",0,5,,1.0,6/9/2014,"We went for a couple of Happy Hour drinks and dinner but when we went to order, we were informed that the Happy Hour margarita's were ""not very good"" and we should order the $8.00 ""better drinks"". We left, went to a nearby Mediterranean place and had a couple of great $3.00 Happy hour drinks! Not going to be a locals place as a $50.00 pre-dinner bar tab isn't going to leave anybody Happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=40
