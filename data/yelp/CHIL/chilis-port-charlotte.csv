Janet G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,3.0,1/12/2018,"Food was good & generous portions, but our server was not so good.  Order drinks and they will bring chips & salsa.   We ordered meal with drinks, and didn't get chips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Patricia H.,"Port Charlotte, FL",101,14,,2.0,11/1/2017,"Wish I had read reviews before going here.   Only gave this two stars because the salad my sister ordered she reported as quite decent. Not so for the steak fajitas or for the service. Honestly, how DO you mess up a fajita?  Well, for starters, you could cook the steak until it's crusty on the outside and dried like shoe leather throughout.   The onions were on the other end of the spectrum -- underdone and still crunchy.  Beans were barely room temperature.   Inexplicably, rice was unusually good -- the only redeeming feature on the platter.   Service was desultory ... I pointed out to the waiter that the meat was cooked way beyond redemption and he countered with excuses as to why it was hard to get it right.   He never made any offer to re-fill the empty soda,   I virtually ALWAYS tip 20% even when service is a little off.  I couldn't bring myself to stiff the guy ,,.. I tipped about 12% which I know was far too much.  As indicated, I really wish we had gone just about anywhere else.  With so many good options in town, no shortage of better choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Gus S.,"Pasadena, CA",23,33,22,4.0,10/1/2017,"Not convenient for wheel chairs. Outside ramps are on far sides, not in front where handicap parking is. Guess to go order pick up is more important",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte

ME B.,"Spring Lake, NC",0,21,,3.0,11/19/2017,The food was pretty good. Our server was great. The place could have been cleaner. The dinning room area needed mopped. After eating I went to the bathroom and had to walk by the kitchen. The kitchen floor was nasty. The bathroom needed cleaned as well. Kinda made me think about my choice to go there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Bj C.,"North Port, FL",7,10,4,1.0,7/30/2017,Got the around 6:15 at 7:45 still didn't  have our food WTF   Left and went to Longhorn and the people there said Codys had run out of food. What is happening in Port Charlotte??,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Lisa G.,"Sarasota, FL",43,2,,5.0,9/14/2017,"Due to Hurricane Irma, restaraunts are very busy and limited on what they hve available to serve.  People also need to be extra patient as many in our community do not have power still- they are hot, over tired, and frustrated.  Our waiter was super busy yet made sure we had drinks and what we needed.  Food was  great as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Sebas R.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,7,2,1.0,5/20/2017,"My kids love Chili's and we decide to stop by here, unfortunately the employees in here are not so friendly, and even when this place was half empty we have to wait for 30 minutes. Then our food took another 30 min I will never come back here, and I wish I can give 0 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Mark H.,"North Port, FL",13,3,,2.0,7/17/2016,"7/17/16 - This afternoon around 4pm, our family of 6 decided to go to Chili's for an early dinner.  We had arrived in the middle of a rain storm and we were the only party in the entrance.   After patiently waiting for about 2 minutes, a manager looked our way from a distance and then walked away. Another minute passed and what appeared to be a hostess came out from the kitchen area into the lounge with another server and a tray full of food acknowledging our party saying ""I'll be right with you"".  The hostess for 3 more minutes stayed at the table in the lounge letting us wait.  After a total of 6 minutes of waiting we decided to leave to eat at another restaurant. As we started walking out, the manager rushed over from the lounge to greet us.  At this point, we had run out of patience and made up our minds to eat at another establishment.   The restaurant didn't appear to be busy, there were many tables near the foyer that had dirty dishes on them, and aside from the random server, staff was nowhere to be seen.  We were disappointed with this visit as we usually eat there at least once a month.  Please hire more help or do something to be more attentive of waiting guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Ann G.,"Sarasota, FL",0,18,,2.0,4/10/2017,"My husband and I went for a quick dinner! Wrong place to go for ""quick"" We ordered and waited and waited! The food finally came and it was dry and tasteless! I had the turkey burger and my husband had the ribs! The hostess and her nose ring kept coming back to sit people as she starred at everyone. What a strange place. We will not return to this Chilis. Have gone to other Chilis and always had a good meal and service. This place is a no no for sure, unless you have 2 hours to grab a quick dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Jenny H.,"Punta Gorda, FL",17,3,,4.0,1/15/2017,"A very busy restaurant at lunch time. But waiting time to recieve food was not long. Waiters were on top of refilling drinks, asking how things are. I got the bacon cheeseburger, it was really greasy but different flavors in the burger that  were tasteful. Strawberry Arnold palmer tea was watered down, didn't taste good at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Alexis C.,"Port Charlotte, FL",4,31,2,4.0,12/20/2016,Had the margarita flatbread salad . Yum very good . There is no dressing on the salad part which is different but probably healthier for you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Tom T.,"Port Charlotte, FL",0,8,,1.0,3/25/2017,"First time in years I've eaten here and let me tell you I won't be back. Telephone service was good . Food, a cheeseburger which was greesy with a stale bun and not edible fries.  Wings that were not edible and thrown away.  That's all the words this place rates. Try plan B or even Plan Z but I'd pass this place by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Kat N.,"North Port, FL",92,29,27,1.0,2/5/2016,"Came here thinking it would be a nice change up for the restaurants closer to my home and it was close to the movies so we'd have plenty of time.  My experiences here have either been home runs or strike outs, and it had been a while. I shouldn't have bothered. The hosts were discombobulated and disorganized. When we asked for a table v. A booth, the hosts told us there would be a 10 minute wait to allow the kitchen to catch up, then a family walked in behind us, asked if they could sit at a table in the bar and were sat immediately, before us.  After a couple of minutes, as an after thought, the kid offered to seat us at the bar, too...never mind that there were plenty of open tables in the main restaurant. After we were seated, one of the bar servers came to take our drink orders. We asked to order everything as we were on a timeline. An hour should have been plenty. She brought our drinks right away, but forgot my lemon and a straw, so I had to wait 5 minutes for her to look up and remember she forgot & come back with them. It took about 10 minutes for them to remember to check on us and realize we needed refills. It then took about 25 minutes for our meals to arrive...cold...but we never got our appetizer. We cancelled it rather than opt to wait. We barely made it out on time to make our movie...and mediocre at best food and the extended wait time makes me think that's the last time I will be going to this particular Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte

Roger T.,"North Port, FL",0,3,,1.0,10/9/2016,"Service at this location has been consistently horrible the last three times we've been here. Today we were seated way in the back of a nearly empty restaurant. We got drinks, but after 25 minutes with no waitress, we left. I had to find a hostess to tell her we were leaving because no one even took our order after such a long wait.  Find somewhere else to eat, we definitely will from now on. Dear management, train and supervise your staff. Dear owner, hire enough competent people to run your store. Unfortunately customers will continue to compromise their expectations and patronize this place. There is no motivation for the service to improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Carhy P.,"North Port, FL",0,3,,1.0,9/30/2016,This place sucks!  Waited 45 minutes for Luke warm food that was prepared terrible. Only saving grace was the waiter was so nice kept apologizing !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Kim W.,"North Port, FL",51,347,306,2.0,10/6/2014,"Visited this location twice.  First time, the service was ok and the food was standard for a chain (might I mention now how Chili's boneless wings are my all time fave as of current). The second time, for the hubby's birthday, we had the unfortunate experience of getting the server who sucks as a waitress/was in training maybe.  The manager was walking around our section, constantly stopping at each table & comping people desserts and meals to make up on how horrific her service was.  Luckily, someone from catering was helping her out and picked up the pieces she left behind .... The mistake with my order, refilling drinks, and checking on us.   When it came time to pay, the newbie gave us our check and then disappeared.  Hubby went to pay at the bar and was told he had to pay our server, who we could not find at the time. Eventually. The hostess found her for us and we paid and left. As I see the other reviews for this location, I see this a common experience here, even if you get a waitress with experience.  I definitely will drive in the other direction to Venice or Sarasota for Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
AaronErin D.,"BOCA GRANDE, FL",29,178,92,3.0,5/21/2014,"Alright it's a chain, we get it. Service should be number one. This review is based on the last two times we've gone, we frequent here a lot because it's a great spot to enjoy before or after a movie near by. For whatever reason the last couple of times it's been awful. We sat yesterday in the bar area and the place was near empty, we ordered drinks and food and for whatever reason the food seriously took close to 45 mins. The server was extremely kind and polite, you could tell she was embarrassed because she disappeared as well. We ordered salad and chicken tacos. We don't ever mind waiting when places are busy, but this restaurant maybe had 10 tables total eating the off time we were there.  What really amazes me is after waiting forever for food that obviously was placed in the window waiting under the hot lights for the complete order, the runner tried handing my stepdaughter a burning hot plate as he said this is really hot. Seriously?! Change the plates in the back? It's for a child! Maybe their training should focus more on common sense rather than counting the amount of sugar packets go on the tables. Not sure if management changed but this place is going down hill. We hope to come back again because the food is a lot better than the other near by chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte
Elizabeth S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",3,42,32,1.0,6/22/2015,"I came here because out of all the places my son wanted to eat here. Well to start off, I stopped eating at any chilis because the food wasn't the same as it was before. This visit was no different. Everything that I loved from chilis is gone. The mash potatoes have no gravy, the French fries were not the same, and the sandwich I ate was flavorless. The staff was great and the waiter was very nice. But chilis itself is not worth the $60-70 we spent eating here. I would of preferred McDonald's (which I'm not a fan of) over chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20
Steve C.,"Davie, FL",1317,672,2244,3.0,1/31/2014,"Ducked in with Mom and the Sis, Diamond Greg, and Bob-oh for some immediately-after Christmas frivolity, Bloody Mary's, and salty chips.  We got what we were after. Good times!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20
Crystal T.,"Port Charlotte, FL",69,2,,1.0,6/7/2015,"Used to be a great spot..must be under horrible New management! Waited 30mins just for a drink (on a slow night) another 45mins before we started to complain about not receiving our food yet or not having the server stop by once to let us know to only have the manager come out and tell us it'll be out shortly, no apologizing..we all just decided to leave..they still gave us a check for our sodas. The manager was very unprofessional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20
Steven H.,"Hampton, VA",35,99,10,3.0,1/7/2013,My first experience at this Chili's was in the bar seating area. The complimentary chips that came with the salsa were bathed in salt. Our onion tanglers were not tended to appropriately so they were a giant ball tanglers that were raw with batter in the middle. The chicken crispers were cooked better than at  some other Chili's. The waitress the first time did not visit the table as often as she could have. The second visit was much better and I have no complains other than not getting some extra fajita things I asked for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20
Jessa T.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,3,,1.0,5/25/2014,I stood at the door for 15 minutes...with waitresses passing me left and right and no one sat us.  So I just left. Do we seat ourselves? Or not? If we do why didn't she tell us? I'm not going back for awhile. I'm a waitress and that is something I would never do! I'm sorry but get better waitresses or train them that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20
Karl H.,"Port Charlotte, FL",0,2,,1.0,12/8/2014,Horrible!! Waited over 1/2 hour for meals. I don't know how long ago those meals were made and how many times they were microwaved.

Kathy P.,"Punta Gorda, FL",1,24,3,5.0,10/9/2014,Chili's had a bright new menu with a lean towards southern California options.  There are fresh options in all area's of the menu.  I choose a California chicken Avocado burger with grilled onions and peppers and a lime mayo sauce.  I'd come back soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20
Steve G.,"Port Charlotte, FL",0,6,1,1.0,6/14/2014,Horrible service. Waited 10 min to be seated and place was empty.

RicMelody S.,"North Port, FL",293,39,7,1.0,11/11/2011,"We have always gone to the Chili's in Sarasota with no problem. We moved to this area and went to Chili's in Port Charlotte. We won't be going back. Our table and seat were sticky. The floor, everywhere, was just dirty...it grossed me out I almost didn't want to eat. Spots on forks. I can't even remember what the food tasted like because I was so grossed out by my surroundings. A restaraunt needs to be as clean as possible so people can eat comfortably and know their food is not contaminated with who knows what.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20
Dean N.,"San Francisco, CA",39,108,95,1.0,4/13/2013,Tasteless and far off from the high marks other cities Chilies. I ponder if they even are part if the franchise or are just cutting corners to make a few extra bucks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20
Christina E.,"Punta Gorda, FL",10,24,3,3.0,8/17/2011,"Glad t.o see the ""team"" approach to service. Drinks were good, service was quick & friendly. Haven't been to Chili's in about 6 mo. We enjoyed ourselves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20

Liz L.,"Belmont, CA",3,35,2,3.0,8/30/2008,"I have a love-hate relationship with this place in Port Charlotte.  Its just a chillies, but its one of the only decent places in town to hang and have some dinner and drinks with your friends, because most of the bars around have bad food and random creepy people.....so even though Im sick of the food and blah service I am always happy to go here on a night out with people to drink and eat.  Its the same song at the applebees and TGI fridays as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20
Amy B.,"Charlestown, MA",26,96,,2.0,5/8/2007,"I haven't been to Chili's in a long time. Now I probably won't be back for a long, long time. I was so disappointed in the lunch I had there. Our appetizers were okay until I found a piece of plastic wrap on my nacho. I can only assume it was from the sour cream container. I had ordered the chicken lettuce wraps for my main course and when they arrived all of the lettuce was totally dirty. ALL of the pieces were covered with black dirt. I have never seen anything like it. I returned the dish explaining the lettuce was dirty. 15 minutes later I received my food back. They had washed the lettuce, but made no effort to remove any of the water so my chicken was sitting in a pool of water. Need  I say more?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-charlotte?start=20
