Melly H.,"Port Orange, FL",83,55,483,5.0,12/5/2011,It's been a few months since I've been here. Was seated & couldn't believe the waiter (Kirk) still knew what I wanted after only seeing me twice previously lol. I swear he has an awesome memory. Great personality as well. I am using this review to recommend him when you visit if you want prompt attentive service with a cute smile. Food melted in my mouth. Manager stopped by table. Great visit. Thanks Kirk!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange?start=20
Dylan W.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",0,3,3,5.0,7/7/2014,This place is great! It's cheap and has amazing food! Good service and even when it's busy they still are fast with food! I would recommend it to everyone!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange?start=20
Sarah R.,"Port Orange, FL",0,26,,3.0,7/31/2014,"The service here is hit and miss and the majority of their entrees are bland and uninteresting. However, I am a fan of their chips and salsa, appetizers, and two-for-one drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange?start=20
Lyle B.,"Port Orange, FL",4,74,25,3.0,7/29/2012,"Pretty much what you expect from a Chili's, but not quite. The chips were very inconsistent. Some were very salty, some had none.  Some were way under cooked and some were perfect.  Shrimp tacos were as good as usual and the service was ok, not great, but ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange?start=20
Sara M.,"Boston, MA",92,507,5,3.0,12/20/2009,"I came here with my sister-in-law for lunch.  We were herded to the bar, which I found interesting because what if we wanted to eat in the main dining area?  We were seated in a comfortable booth and our server greeted us quickly.  The margaritas we ordered with grand marnier were pretty good!  The chips and salsa were not bad but the chips were not very warm while the salsa was a bit runny. I ordered the steak fajitas and it came out sizzling.  The flavor was pretty good and the meat was not chewy.  I was surprised that I only received three tortillas since I had at least another serving left of meat and condiments.  The tortilla wasn't the freshest or the best I have had but it did make for a satisfying lunch.   Overall, it was what you would expect for a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange?start=20
Stacey F.,"Port Orange, FL",51,2,,5.0,6/26/2011,"I love my local Chili's! When I'm out with my family and friends, the servers and hostesses always greet us with a smile. I am pleased with the restaurant as a whole! I have never had a bad experience with our neighborhood Chili's! The coupons that are sent to me by email are fantastic! They cater to the families by offering FREE kids meals so the families can all eat out together without the financial worries. They also offer the ""Meals for Two"" specials, which is perfect on a tight budget. During these economic hardships, Chili's comes out on top! And, I have to say that my local Chili's is in it to win it!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange?start=20

Sara S.,"Ormond Beach, FL",16,55,9,1.0,11/26/2017,"My goodness. What a difference from the last time I went to Chili's. 1/2 the menu is gone, the food was extremely salty and such poor quality. I'm so disappointed in the dinner tonight. The waiter was wonderful and helpful so I would give him the 5 stars but that's the only perk about that place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Dave O.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",655,2374,8207,4.0,2/20/2016,"It's apparent from the previous reviews, the experience here can be really good or really bad. Fortunately our visit on a recent Thursday night the service in the bar area was great and the food was what we expected. We do love the two for one daily drink specials, they have ice cold Dos Equis on draft served in a frozen glass with fresh cut lime, this make just about anything off the typical Chili's menu a little bit better. The chips and salsa are always a good starter, the chips are paper thin, light and warm, the salsa is just okay, great texture but lacks full flavor and heat. I did like their Memphis Dry Rubbed Ribs and Grilled Chicken combo, the ribs were perfectly spiced and fall off the bone tender, the chicken absolutely melts in your mouth. The trio fajitas are a pretty solid choice as well, steak, chicken and shrimp, I'd like them more if the veggies had a touch of char but over-all we were pleased. No complaints tonight hopefully they can maintain this level of service, based on the experience tonight I'd come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Lucy D.,"Miami, FL",0,136,272,3.0,10/11/2016,"Beware of the kiosks table entertainment ... it is NOT free. I paid $1.99 for paying two games of trivia. Anyways, in reference to the food & service.  My husband and I went for lunch and ordered from the lunch menu. The lunch menu has many options and the prices are reasonable staring at $6 which is extremely cheap for a decent lunch. The serve was quick and the servers were friendly.  I would recommend this Chilis and would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Rob B.,"Portland, OR",37,21,17,5.0,3/7/2017,"We went there yesterday for happy hour and as always, Chili's delivers. They have the best atmosphere and your food comes out hot unlike another place nearby that goes by the name of a day of the week that's between Thursday and Saturday. The bartender was fast and very friendly. They have a $3, $4 and $5 Appetizer menu during happy hour which I think is from 3-7. They also have 2 for 1 drinks! We got chips and salsa, boneless wings and a 22 oz. Beer each. Our bill was less than $15.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
James P.,"Apollo Beach, FL",67,459,57,3.0,7/29/2016,"Safe and boring and fine old Chili's.  Sometimes food and service is good, sometimes not. I really don't know what to say about this place.  The ennui of ""yet another chain location that is exactly the same as every other one ever"" is hopelessly crushing.  But if that level of existential dread is getting to you while you eat a burger or some pseudo-mex here, I guess you could pound a few Presidente margaritas and feel better about yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Lucy R.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",1,7,11,4.0,2/17/2017,Sat in the bar. Found out that chips and salsa are not free anymore in the bar. Slow service and tables  sat dirty while employees walked by. Restaurant and bar were not that busy. Food was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Bob S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",27,1,,1.0,10/18/2016,"Had lunch at 12pm and at 12am I was so sick I couldn't leave the toliet. FOOD POSION. Be careful eating here,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Ed D.,"Port Orange, FL",0,3,,1.0,12/9/2016,Went in for lunch this week. Server informed me that chips and salsa now cost $3.49. REALLY? More corporate greed. That will be my last trip to Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Jennifer D.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",0,9,,5.0,5/8/2016,"Once again, we chose Chili's for our Mother's Day dinner & had an excellent meal. We ordered from their to-go menu and was given our pick-up time for 7:30PM, but we got our food at 7:25PM instead!  My mother order the fried pickles, the chipotle chicken and the toffee brownie for dessert. My father ordered the babyback ribs with a house salad and molten lava cake. Finally, I ordered the Texas Cheese Fries, Quesadilla Explosion Bowl and the Chocolate Chip Cookie Skillet. The texas fries were absolutely AMAZING! The applewood bacon was perfect. Smoky, but not salty and crunchy and the side ranch went perfectly! Preferably, I would've liked the ribs in the jalepenos, but was still phenomenal!  Quesadilla Salad was as good as last time. Tender, juicy chicken, delicious quesadillas and a yummy salad with honey mustard dressing.  The desserts (all of them) were HEAVENLY! They are also VERY filling - If you plan on having a plate first, wait till your finished as the dessert technically is a plate in itself. My dad said the ribs were perfect and fell right off the bone and my mom said all od her food was perfect too.  As usual, we will definitely return! This place is our favorite family grill in town!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Shannon H.,"North De Land, FL",203,161,481,1.0,6/28/2014,"I Just stopped there for a to-go dinner and I'm so annoyed and appalled by my experience.  I got inside and my waitress was very polite and let me know my food wasnt ready yet. So I told her I was going to run to the restrooms.  When I got back, my bill was sitting on the counter and the waitress was still in the back. I waited about 5 minutes when someone came in the door behind me. He was very impatient and asked me if I'd been helped yet. I told him I was waiting to be checked out. He said okay then yelled into the back for someone he knew. My first thought was that he was going to get someone to ring me up but instead, a man came out from the back, they greeted eachother then started having a conversation in spanish. As if I didnt feel awkward enough, the waiter never acknowledged me, and proceeded to take the other guys order and ring him up as I got pushed to the side.  I felt like, because I didnt speak spanish, I didnt matter. I just got pushed to the side. My waitress returned with my food and told me ""Im sorry, I have to wait for the register."" Which the other two were still working on. She must have seen the look on my face because she excused herself to the bar to get a card to open another register for me. I tipped her, but im still very upset over the other waiters customer service.  I dont mind having to wait, but at least tell me whats going on. Dont just ignore me, and ring up someone else because they're your buddy. I got the fajita trio, it traveled well, but the shrimp was too salty for my liking.  No other complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Al W.,"Port Orange, FL",39,5,,1.0,5/28/2016,Went to chilies for dinner on May 27 and I ordered a mushroom burger with fries. The other I was with ordered their food and we waited tell we our meals and everyone got theirs but me after 45 minutes the waitress come over and says sorry we forgot to put in your order. The manager said we will put it in now and I said what's the point everyone at our table is done eating already. I will go somewhere else. He apologized and said this happens on occasion and I told home what lousy service this is and he agreed gave me a twenty dollar gift certificate to come back. The device was lousy and the manager should of went out of his way to comp the others that was in our party. I would not recommend this place to my dog.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange

Mandi M.,"Port Orange, FL",16,78,10,4.0,3/22/2016,"Great food and bargain.  The service is got or miss here, although you can't get bad service in,the bar area most times, but it's hard to get a seat in there during peak hours for games etc",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Justin M.,"Neptune Beach, FL",5,33,35,2.0,5/20/2015,We came for the new mix and match fajitas for 2....pic attached and got delivered a tiny portion of chicken and steak and sides...not like picture or worth the $20 (steak and chicken were considered upgrades)...very disappointing,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Josette L.,"Oak Hill, FL",46,74,86,3.0,8/30/2014,Food was good service as well good the hooker at the bar that was drunk trying to pick every fellow up was a total turn off the two drunk men next to her playing along were equally as pathetic not to mention the bar tender that continued to serve all three of them...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Jessica J.,"Daytona Beach, FL",359,431,570,2.0,1/30/2012,"Meh! I've had better. Not promptly greeted upon entering. No one at the hostess stand. Finally, someone came over. Floor dirty. Table dirty. But once we were seated, our server was great!  Food was meh and greasy. I think I'll take my business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Matt P.,"Port Orange, FL",35,3,,1.0,6/24/2016,"Ate there tonight. Walked in, the hostess just looked at me and my family, turned her back on us as she talked to a man that appeared to be the manager. After about 5 minutes went by, I had to ask if there was a table ready, which there wasn't. I don't understand why one wasn't ready, they weren't all that busy.  At least 8 tables were empty, but not set for new diners. Then the server seemed as though she couldn't even remember her own name.  The only thing good about this experience was the food. Maybe it was a bad night. Probably not though since it wasn't very busy on a Friday night. Won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Dill B.,"Santee, CA",0,6,2,1.0,7/15/2015,"Doesn't serve milk. No grilled cheese. Would give 0 stars if possible. Don't go here go to Sonic of Santee, California instead!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
Susan G.,"Port Orange, FL",0,24,,2.0,4/24/2016,"Another visit to Chili's yesterday afternoon....thought a nice lunch before work would be great.  We were seated immediately.  Our server, Rich, seemed to be on a dead run the whole time we were there.  The place was not that busy at 3pm.  I think Rich is very well intended but this was just nuts.  Get the drinks, get the order, enter the order,  all in the space of about 90 seconds.  The fajitas came out cooked correctly but with the incorrect condiments.  The meat was fatty and not very edible.  In the middle of the meal I had to get my own napkins from a service area.  Hubby's salad was fine.  I wonder what was up but if your server can only spend milliseconds at your table when only a few tables are occupied  there is a disturbance in the force somewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-port-orange
