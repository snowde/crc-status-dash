Jack E.,"Prescott, AZ",3,96,39,4.0,12/18/2017,Being from So Cal we have dined at a number of Chili's before moving to AZ.  This  was the first Chili's we have dined at since moving.  We had attended an event at the Yavapai College Performing Arts Center and decided to drive out to PV for dinner.  While we didn't have any particular place in mind we opted to give Chili's a try.  We were seated right away and the waitress was right there to take our drink order.  I was in the mood for ribs so I opted for the 2 meat combo of ribs & sausage.  I knew the ribs would not be smoked like I make them but I also knew they would be tender and tasty.  Not sure of their exact cooking method but would assume they are possibly par boiled and then roasted.  My wife opted for the stuffed chicken wings.  Both entrée's arrived nice and hot.   The ribs were fall off the bone tender but there was no smoke flavor.  The sauce I chose was very tasty.  The sausage was very tasty as well.  The corn on the cob was frozen but still had some flavor.  The fries were very good as well.   We finished our meal with the chocolate molten cake.  One of my favs. Our waitress was fantastic.  Wish I could recall her name to give her a shout out here.  She was excellent and hope we get her again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley

David K.,"Chandler, AZ",0,55,61,5.0,5/22/2017,Once in a lifetime experience - just finished a day at Lynx Lake Cayaking Around the Lake for a couple hours meeting great people watching a bald eagle fly over and enjoying great homemade German food at the lynx lake lodge and thought I'd stop at Chili's to try the new smokehouse barbecue special oh my gosh two half racks of ribs with two different sauces both fantastic jalapeño sausage corn on the cob and a steamed pickle a baked cheese bread and a basket of fries take a look at the picture it was 3 and a half meals ate until full at chili's and took the leftovers home and ate 2 full meals from the leftovers - 8 5 to 9 rating for everything at under $20 sounds crazy wait until you see the attached pic lady walks by and says that smells awesome is it as good as it smells I said sit down and try it which she did see pic 2 so food value 9.5 but that's not the best part - waiters name was Jonah I asked him like the story of the whale and he breaks out in one of the greatest outbursts of joy and happiness that over ever seen uncontrollable joy that brought smiles of joy from the manager James Wilson and the near by waiter Daniel - want to see unbridled joy of a waiter in a restaurant that gets the importance of culture and appreciating employees see pic of manager admiring waiter - two other ladies at a nearby table joined to see what the excitement was about - Jonah engaged with us several times asking if the meal was hot if the ribs were tender which of the two sauces we preferred - and could not have conveyed a more genuine interest - absolutely could not imagine ever having another dining experience like it - if it weren't for the attached pictures I wouldn't believe it either - lynx lake canoeing and chili's with Noah likely an afternoon you'll be yelping like I am,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
Norm S.,"Prescott, AZ",79,14,5,2.0,6/11/2017,"The food is sort of ok, but the service is SLOW.  Two times, and we won't be back.  They quit offering the prime rib bowl, which my wife liked.  No reason to come back.  Waiters ignored us both of these visits too.  Definitely won't be back for a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
Scott B.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",91,59,87,1.0,7/28/2017,"I have long ago blacklisted this company!  I'd give a negative score if possible.  They have long surpassed customer service in their arrogance for the ""f"" you- self serving ordering and payment.  Well ALL six times my visits- all food comes out to my table at long intervals.  when my food arrives...my guests have completely finished eating. WRONG!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
John M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,33,6,1.0,10/1/2017,"Poor Chili's! How far they have fallen! My wife and I ate there the other day and sadly, she ordered the ribs. Unlike their advertisements or what their menu says, the meat does not fall off the bone. When her order came by, she could barely cut it with a knife. The waiter noticed and sent the manager over.  While he was nice, he didn't even attempt to replace the ribs and gave us a discount only. I think he was aware his product is no longer up to par. Hopefully, they will get better in the future but for now, we will stay away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
Karen And Jack J.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",2,18,,3.0,9/12/2017,"Chili's is Chilis.  Had the Carribean salad with grilled shrimp, which was pretty good.  Jack had a dinner salad because they never tell you when they are out of something, like the chili he wanted.  It would be a good idea for them to tell you when you are seated what they are out of before you are ready to order.  Won't be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
Brett C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,1,1.0,4/29/2017,"The food was excellent, but the service was poor at best. The host stand took a few minutes to acknowledge and seat my girlfriend and I. They finally did and Dakota, the server, came over and asked for the drinks while my girlfriend had to step away for a moment. She brought the drinks over and set them on the table without saying anything.  After 10-15 minutes, Dakota finally came by to take a food order from us, but then we didn't see her for at least 25 minutes, but she helped a few other tables in the meantime. Our food was brought by another runner, who also filled our water. Dakota came at that point, and also made appearances as it came time for the bill to be paid. When paying on the kiosk, Dakota said to let her know if I need help with it. While leaving feedback, the other runner came by and asked if I was leaving positive feedback for our server, to which I said 'no' and explained why. Dakota came by and listened, but walked away without apologizing, so she seemed very apathetic. I spoke to the manager and let her know about the experience. She was very apologetic about it and wished I had mentioned it prior to paying. I let her know that wasn't my desire, but she insisted on giving us some gift cards for the future. She was very empathetic and nice.  It was my first time ever in Prescott Valley and felt as if my presence was an inconvenience to the server. I was the only person of color there and hope her treatment towards me wasn't indicative of that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
Joseph B.,"Humboldt, AZ",44,87,21,5.0,5/26/2016,"There food never disappoints! I usually always get the Big Mouth Bites (sliders) and they are amazing! Something about the bread is smooth and compliments the burgers well. I used to get a different burger before and certain tacos, but they changed the menu so now the sliders are my meal of choice. That's probably the only thing I don't like about Chilis is that they change their menu every so often. I love their Coronaritas!! But that's on special occasions lol.  Our server today was very friendly and fast. She was helpful and on top of her refills which is always a huge plus. She also remembered my side of ranch, which most forget and I have to re-ask. She saw we got sat at a small table with 6 big guys and moved us right away lol. Overall, great experience like usual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
George W.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,39,,4.0,9/2/2017,Great food and service.  No discounts for Military veterans or AARP.  A little loud but tolerable.  Food was well cooked and the server was engaged and friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
Jacs W.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,1,,1.0,8/27/2017,"Do not get to go from here. Came out late, was cold and clearly had been sitting for a while. The texas fries were a cold solid mass that couldnt be heated up Because it was on tin foil. My order of onion rings consisted of 2 onion rings, and I paid extra for them. My husband's smoke house combo had 3 chicken tenders. Seasoning/butter on the street corn was thrown into the tinfoil and not on the corn. Overall super disappointing. I wish I could take my tip back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
Grace A.,"Prescott, AZ",8,29,5,5.0,8/26/2016,"Had the new grass-fed hamburger (as part of the ""Oldtimer with Cheese"") and it was delicious!  Service was excellent and the restaurant (including the ladies room) was clean.  What made this outstanding was the little device on the table . . . I was fervently trying to get the menu to pull up on my phone-I have food allergies and checked out the burger itself and sides before we left home-but forgot to check the bun and condiments.  Our server Corey pulled up this nifty little screen that showed everything that I CAN order with my allergy.  This made it so much easier and nicer.  We will be eating here more often!  Thanks Chilis!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley

Royce S.,"Phoenix, AZ",145,6,,3.0,2/22/2017,Food is okay but inconsistent. The floor of the bar area always seems to be sticky and feels unclean. My biggest complaint is that in 2017 the restaurant does not provide public wifi. This seems to be a major oversight considering most fast food places provide it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley

I called in my meal to be ready so my family could make a 7:00 movie. got there at 6:40 and they had my food ready in to go boxes we sat there and ate it at the table real quick  Waitress brought us drinks and we went on with our night got to the theatre by 7:00!

Vern G.,"Prescott, AZ",4,19,,5.0,5/24/2017,I can't believe this restaurant has only 3 stars. We've been there twice and had terrific service and fantastic food both times. This time we did their 2 for $22 deal with an appetizer and two entrees .  We had salads for our appetizer and they were  fresh and delicious. My husband had the bacon burger with fries and I had the baby back ribs with broccoli as I'm watching my carbs. Both meals were really good. The service was VERY quick  and extremely friendly. Laurie was our server and she is so much fun and efficient as well. Ask for her section to meet her. She is amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
Frances L.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,3,,2.0,6/4/2017,"Their ribs are far from fall off the bone. I had to saw them with a knife to separate and then chew, chew, chew. I would never order them again. Also they charge too much for craft beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
Brian S.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",62,8,5,1.0,12/27/2014,Well this time we had the worst ever server brought me a wine glass with lipstick on it and soap still in the glass photo in closed.

Bob D.,"Prescott, AZ",2,38,,2.0,1/13/2017,"This place could do better. First, they will seat you at a dirty table. As soon as the hostess walked away I switched to a slightly cleaner table. Food is a greasy mess I got one of their top of the line burgers (if you will) and it just gave me that feeling afterward like you get when you just eat low quality food, And when your kids don't eat their chicken fingers you know its bad. I remember Chili's use to be good..not sure if it is just this location. This place gives the impression its all about the profit margin and not about serving quality meals. Why not try both quality and value? I for one won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley
Ecp D.,"Wichita, KS",0,1,,1.0,5/17/2015,The service and management are terrible. Michael Melbourne is a bonafied idiot and is more concerned with quantity of cranking out eating utensils rather then washing them. We had dry salsa dip at the bottom of our bowl. I can only imagine what the back is like. They also don't respect veterans or military as a discount was not honored as I witnessed across from me. Go elsewhere not to this crappy place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley?start=40
Brooke M.,"Granada Hills, CA",26,24,6,1.0,7/13/2014,Wow. The worst. Blah! The food is yuck and flavorless and the service was mediocre.  It took forever too.

Stacie G.,"Gilbert, AZ",15,10,2,1.0,7/12/2014,"Pretty bad. Not only did it take more than 45 mins to order and receive our food, the only one of five plates that came out right was the kids grilled cheese. One medium steak was raw and the other was well done. Nothing looked appetizing like the photos. Manager was less than concerned. Needless to say we did not eat the food since so much was wrong.

Toriana R.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",19,41,1,1.0,10/15/2014,"Well.. where should I start..((if they are going to rack their priced up, their customer service should be too!)) our server was Sara, the first thing we did was ask her what beers they carried and prices and her response was ""I don't know, they are listed somewhere in the menu."" Once we ordered drinks, she brought them out one drink at a time(there were 3 of us) my boyfriend ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs, which had absolutely no meat on them! I ordered a burger and fries. The fries tasted like cardboard and were cold. My burger was also cold, the cheese was not melted and it had about a teaspoon of guac on it which was just thrown on top. After waiting everyone else at my table to be finished ordering,  our server finally came back to check on us, so I could finally send my burger back. The manager then brought it out and never apologized, he just handed it back and said ""the guac is like 30 degrees, so that's why the burger is cold."" He then said ""I'll buy you guys dessert so you don't have to eat alone, since everyone else is done."" After paying and getting ready to walk out, our server then came back to the table and ""asked"" if we wanted our burger comped. We definitely will not be back!

Mike B.,"Salem, OR",40,198,43,3.0,12/28/2011,"Chain restaurant food at chain restaurant prices.  If you have eaten at one Chili's you have eaten at them all. There will be no surprises.  Good food and a decent price.  I had their lunch half sandwich with fries and it was the same as it was at any Chili's. Prices are reasonable for the food you receive.  We opted for their chips and salsa to start.  I have to say, I found their chips a little too thin and a little too salty.   Apart from that, our server was friendly and helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley?start=40

Joe P.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",2,12,,3.0,7/24/2010,If I would have wrote this review a year ago it probably would have been a single star. We had raw chicken served to us twice.

Jion S.,"Prescott, AZ",0,7,,4.0,9/5/2010,The food is good - especially the ribs - I like the new honey chipotle sauce - it's really different & better than the shiner bock.

Jay M.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,17,5,2.0,5/1/2016,"Arrived nearly 30 minutes before closing, after a long day on the road, and the doors were locked.

Stephanie H.,"Phoenix, AZ",49,4,2,1.0,5/6/2016,"If I could give this a negative 10 stars I would. First the waitress never told us her name, she had an attitude immediately and acted like she couldn't be bothered.  She refilled an iced tea once and she had to be 'waved' down to refill the other drinks.  When we got the appetizer the plates that came with it were FILTHY (they had cheese and spinach and tomato slathered between them) Come in Chilis, rinse your dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. We waited a good amount of time for two of three entrées to come out, and one steak wasn't cooked how it was ordered. When the entrées came out the waitress had a 'bitchy' attitude about how the sides weren't part of the 2 for 20. When it was brought up to her that every other time they did, she said 'management' told her it wasn't but it would be taken care of, then the 'manager' came running over and started an argument about how it didn't saying the menu(it says full size entree). We explained we understood this but the menu still said one thing. The 'manager' started raising her voice and yelling at us about 'insulting' her and her staff.  Guess what Chilis you insulted long time customers.  We were also told we were not allowed back in, we did nothing wrong, the staff that worked here tonight were rude and terrible. This 'manager' needs to have some retraining on what it means to work in customer service, she clearly doesn't know how to treat a customer.  The health department should come in and take a look at the cleanliness of the restraint as well, there was old food wedged in the booth, which we noticed as we were grabbing purses to leave. If the front of house looks like this and how the dirty plates looked, how does the kitchen or bar look???? Mike Melbourne needs to look into hiring a new 'manager' or shift leader or cook or whatever she does there, this Lori or Laura... She purposely said her name fast and loud so we could catch it because she knows she screwed up tonight in many levels.  We were not rude until the staff was rude to us. Reading other reviews I'm not surprised we experienced this kind of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley?start=20

Literally turned her back.  We sat in the bar.  The bartender and waitress were shouting from the bar to the table she was bussing.  As a guest i don't care to hear the loud employee conversation, don't care what you did last night. The ketchup bottle was empty, grabbed one from another table and it felt disgusting.  The table was dirty and when i went to move the thing you pay on, it was literally stuck to the table.  We both ordered chicken and a few hours later, we both feel awful.  They lowered the price on the presidente margarita and it was the worst ever.  The frys were not fresh, rather tough tasting.  The tortillas on my chicken were a soggy mess.  I've eaten and drank in chili's in  Florida, California, Oregon, Tennessee and now Arizona.  And this one just ruined it for me.  Not sure what happened at the table behind me, but the bartender, Greg, must have apologized 6 or 7 times to them.   I will never give this one another try, They are closing  various Chili's down for a reason, and i really get it.  I used to care, but after today, I'm breaking up with chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley?start=20

No. Like others mentioned, it was slow. For a couple of burgers and some kids meals we were there for an hour and a half-- no appetizers, we ordered right away.  The food was decent (although my wife says not to order the turkey burger), but the general attitude of the service staff is pretty rude. Our server was nice enough, but others around the restaurant (we had plenty of time for bathroom trips and such) seemed mean and always made me and my kids step aside to allow them to walk through first (just the opposite of pretty much every restaurant I have ever been in).

Kevin E.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,9,,2.0,5/28/2015,"Chili's has been here for awhile. They recently did an update in the décor. The food is usually always decent. The service is another issue. It's more of a hang out than a job for these kids, which is understandable. The down side is that their cups are absolutely disgusting they have a nasty gel film of star san stuck to them (dip and rinse); Waiter was put off that I asked for another cup, the next cup was even worse. I gave up at that point brought it to the attention of the manager who could have cared less. This is a small town of about 40,000. Not too many choices to go out to eat. Chili's keep your restaurant clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley?start=20

Natty K.,"Surprise, AZ",0,29,,1.0,10/6/2014,"Poor management, no customer service and did I say, POOR MANAGEMENT?!? We had an issue with our check because of a coupon. When we tried to rectify the issue with Rebecca, the ""manager"", she refused to be reasonable about it and would NOT except our valid coupon. She was blatantly rude and she made us feel unwelcome and unappreciated. She had a nasty attitude and she was completely unprofessional. Rebecca is an absolute ogre and a horrible manager. She's obviously not qualified to be in the position she is in. I will not be returning to this Chilis location. There are plenty of other family restaurants I would love to give my business to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley?start=20

SixCat F.,"Chino Valley, AZ",49,50,127,3.0,8/18/2013,"Definitely loved my dinner (Cajun Chicken Pasta 2/ shrimp added), my husband said his was good (bacon-ranch chicken quesadilla), but nothing special. Loved my dessert (peanut butter lava cake)! Our waitress was a bit inattentive, I almost got up to get my own coffee refill more than once. Will go back, just not any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-prescott-valley?start=20
