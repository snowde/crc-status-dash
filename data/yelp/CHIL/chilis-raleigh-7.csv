Maura T.,"Raleigh, NC",3,55,9,1.0,11/23/2007,"My rating of this restaurant is based on 1 unpleasant visit  in which we did not stay to dine. Here's how it went: My husband and I were craving burgers and decided on Chili's, as we had had excellent burgers here in the past. We arrived at the restaurant. It was less than half full of patrons at about 7:30 pm on a weeknight. The hostess led us to our table. En route, we encountered dirty, sticky floors, uncleared tables and a ""caution wet floor sign"" in our path, which our 2 year old daughter knocked over (oops!). At our table, we were hesitant to sit down given the greasy hand prints on the seats, crumpled napkins and used silverware under the table and crumbs/stickiness on the table. I glanced around to assess the dining scene, wondering if the waitstaff was ""in the weeds"" but in fact it seemed like a slow night. While searching for a waiter to wipe down our nasty table, it dawned on me that perhaps we shouldn't stay. I've learned from past food poisoning incidents at restaurants that you should ""go with your gut"" (pun intended) when it tells you NOT TO DINE HERE. Well, we made a decision to leave, but not before we had summoned the manager on duty to explain simply why we had chosen to leave before dining. Rather than listening and interpreting our feedback as constructive, the  manager reacted defensively by retorting, ""Do you want a tour of the kitchen?"" (implying that the kitchen was up to code and that we were overreacting). There were no apologies given, though the management attempted to accommodate us with different seating. Needless to say, we were not interested at that point. In retrospect, I am so glad we made the decision to trust our intuition and leave the restaurant rather than risk a potentially poor dining experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=40
Lee L.,"Raleigh, NC",0,3,,1.0,9/14/2016,Worst experience ever cold food horrible service and was even called a vulgar name wow I have never in my life thanks to the server Shaun for reminding to never eat there again kitchen staff cursing were children could hear worst visit ever I do not recommend Paul was the manager sorry for your establishment I'm sure sales and tumbling down with that kind of work ethic thanks for reminding me why not to choose chilis I spoke to corporate just so you know,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=20
Mary K.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,5,7,1.0,11/11/2016,"We stayed at the hotel across the parking lot and were very excited to be able to walk across the street to eat and relax after a long trip. I noticed immediately that the hostess was being very rude and short with the couple in front of us. I also noticed that the other couple waiting seemed uncomfortable.... there were MANY open tables and I thought it strange that there were so many people waiting to be seated. When it was our turn she was also short I misunderstood her asking for our name and she corrected me like I was a child. My BF jokingly asked why there was so many open tables and still a 15min wait. Instead of giving him an acceptable reply, a joke, a simple an explanation, an apology for the wait... she gave him an extremely condescending stare and said ""There is STILL a WAIT SIR!"" WOW!!! I've worked in many restaurants, a hostess job is to make you feel welcome not like you're being a pain in the A! Needless to say we left! We walked next door to Macaroni Griil, were seated immediately and had delicious hot food in front of us in LESS than 15 min.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=20
Donnell P.,"Raleigh, NC",370,79,204,3.0,10/15/2014,Food is ok. Good place for a quick meal or even to watch a game. The fajitas are pretty good. I haven't been too impressed with their burgers. They stay open late so that's always a plus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=20
Emily M.,"Midlothian, VA",87,2,,2.0,1/16/2016,"Highly disappointed in this Chili's location. The orders were not taken correctly and the waitress was not properly trained to handle a larger than normal party.... We had one person whom did not get their food for at least 20 min after the rest of our party did, after waiting 45 minutes for all of our food. The tortillas to our fajitas were completely hard and not warm at all, the cheese was crispy. There was a hair in one plate. All of the chips were broken. They bumped us to refill out drinks. Bills were completely a mess, it took at least 20 minutes to get out of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=20
Crystal D.,"Raleigh, NC",83,53,161,2.0,6/15/2014,"My husband, being from Texas, loves this chain, although for the life if me I cannot understand why? I think it must be pure nostalgia on his part because Chili's is barely a notch or two above Applebee's IMO. I'm not sure I've had a single dining experience when I didn't have to send something back for being overcooked, undercooked, soggy, or just not good.  The atmosphere is ""meh"" at best, noisy & greasy feeling - typical low end bar & grill restaurant chain ambiance. Service is hit or miss, though I have to admit, it's been mostly positive at this location. The tortilla chips are good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=20
Faisal D.,"Raleigh, NC",0,3,,1.0,12/15/2015,"They dont even deserve one star. After waiting for 30 minutes, i recieved a plate half full and the rude waiter said ""do you want it or not"". Dont ever go there",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=20
Mollie B.,"Raleigh, NC",4,10,,5.0,8/1/2015,"We ordered takeout last night about 10:15 after shopping at target. The togo girl was really nice and helpful. We did a simple 2 for $20 and I had the margarita grilled chicken and my hubby got the Cajun chicken pasta. Both were delicious... Plenty of sauce on he pasta and the grilled chicken was seasoned perfectly! Black beans and rice that came with the grilled chicken were flavorful and the perfect accompaniment! The food took longer than expected but was worth the wait! The food was hot, fresh and super yummy especially for being so late at night! We had the onion rings as an appetizer which were pretty good but we ate our meals first so they got cold. Will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=20

Chris M.,"Raleigh, NC",52,18,,1.0,1/10/2015,"My husband and I made the mistake of going to this Chili's for the first time last friday night.  The night was a disaster. First of all I ordered a glass of wine and they only gave half a glass for full price.  The waitress was so slow, took our appetizer order and said ""I'll be right back.""  15 minutes later she came back for our dinner order.  We placed our orders.  It took 30 minutes for our dinners to come out, it was not even that busy. A table of 4 next to us came in AFTER us and were served their food before the two of us.  My husband's steak was ordered medium and came back super well done.  Their chicken flatbread was  greasy mess that I ordered.  We talked to the manager and got his meal comped but would never return to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=20
X X.,"Washington, DC",0,351,,1.0,6/12/2016,"We left. Employees stand in front of the restaurant. And make obscene gestures toward guests. They are in the car. And the hand goes out the window of the car. And tired of the bad service. We seemed to have the same problems. Management at the end of the meal. Said not any problems. We said if not give compensation. We will refuse to pay for the credit sale. We just left without paying for the meal. The parking lot is small. Female employees not want to wait on female customers. And we had the same problems. The Hostess/waitstaff same problems.Talk back rude,rush to get rid of, walk away from females while they are talking to them and not come back,stand behind female customers and yell in the ear,yell and interrupt, repeat the same questions, walk in front of females and try to step on the foot, eat food and repeat the same questions while wait on.And not volunteer to wait on female customers. And run away from.Hostess threw the menu on the table. The decor and menu is standard franchise . Waitperson got angry we not spend much money and not get a tip. Service was slow. Waitperson not want to write down the menu. Said not want to. We said it was a part of the job. We got corn on the cob with a lot of pepper and butter. We not want anything on it. The drinks came with 3/4 ice. And we not order ice. The hamburger came spicy and not fully cooked. The steak was burned. And not ordered it that way. We got food and drink at the same time. And employee said want anything else. We had to ask the employee to correct the meal items. And the chicken grilled came with a lot of herbs on it.

Adrienne D.,"Raleigh, NC",0,17,5,3.0,11/19/2015,"I stopped in for lunch today. Had the nacho appetizer and one of their new burgers (sweet and Smokey). The nachos were a little soggy and stuck together so when you picked one up, it took the toppings off another. The burger was pretty good...had crispy onion rings on top...yum! The only problem, other than soggy nachos, was the ticket times. Nachos took close to 15 minutes and then our burgers took another 15 or 20. I have noticed it is hard to go here when I only have an hour lunch break. I always order a side salad instead of French fries...and this is the ONLY time I've never had an offer for the salad to come out first, which is my preference. I guess I should have mentioned, that but I assumed it would. I was looking for our server to ask for the salads, but could never locate her until the burger and salad came out. I had to scarf down my food very quickly to make it back to work-which is bad since I work right across the street!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=20

Chancia C.,"Washington, DC",1,35,55,1.0,6/22/2016,"This was the worst experience ever. I have been here before with my brother and it has never been this outrageous!!! The wait time was about 40 minutes on a Wednesday which was crazy. We ordered an appetizer which took about an hour to get to our table. The waitress that we had was Jessica. She hardly came to our table to check on us. I do not know where she was trained for customer servicing, but she needs another run down on how to better serve her clients. We Then ordered our food which also took a while to come to our table. Tables who sat after us by her was taken care of way before we were. On top of all that, the self service machine to pay out died as soon as my brother swiped his card. It took them another 30 minutes to even get the situation handled.

Heather B.,"Raleigh, NC",1,28,8,5.0,8/21/2017,"This seems bizarre, I know - this lady who leaves scathing restaurant reviews at ""nice"" places is giving *Chili's* a 5-star review? I know... I know. But? We've been there two times over the last two weeks (I know. I know!), and both visits were outstanding. Food was well-prepared and tasted great - they even modified a sandwich for me by replacing chicken with a black bean patty. Waiter was attentive and kind. Manager clearly invested in making sure guests were satisfied. I know Chili's kind of took a dive a few years ago, but if you're in the Triangle Town area - consider checking out this one.

Michael B.,"Raleigh, NC",109,429,947,2.0,1/6/2018,"With the dining experience @Chilis it could have been a little bit better.  The appetizer was the chips & queso. The chips appeared to be house made, along with the sauce. But it was really, really watery. The manager said it normally looks that way, so I wouldn't recommend ordering it, ever in that case.  For the kids meal we ordered a Mac n Cheese, but then later the manager came out and stated they didn't have any Mac n Cheese. Then I ordered the Crispy Chicken Dippers. When it came out I was a little disappointed. It looked like they took a couple of chicken strips, and just cut them in tiny pieces after it was cooked. Plus they didn't bring any dipping sauce with the chicken DIPPERS. The pieces were cut too small to dip as well.  With the steaks, the steak was ordered medium, but it was brought back well done, no pink anywhere. The second steak was brought back very medium rare. Just to make sure I wasn't misjudging it I asked the manager, who even stated it was medium rare, so they threw it back on the grill to cook it more.  With the other steak, it was cooked just right, but the taste and texture was so bad I had to ask for some A1 Steak Sauce. A good steak should be good in its own, and shouldn't need a mask or anything to cover up with the natural taste and flavor of the meat.  With the server at the end, he kept the itemized receipt, and then acted like it was a problem when I wanted the itemized receipt, instead of just the credit card receipt. Plenty of people keep the itemized receipt, it could have been a business expense or something. When he brought back the original itemized receipt, he had to unball it, as he tossed it in the trash. Don't trash my receipt without asking me first. If I leave it on the table, then you can trash it. If I am still there, and paying you, then please allow me the option to keep it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7
Paul Z.,"Raleigh, NC",3,20,3,1.0,11/18/2017,"Wow! Their new ribs are TINY! This is a FULL rack! Questioned it as it look like a half rack. Server said they are getting a lot of complaints.

Olivia P.,"Raleigh, NC",16,128,284,5.0,2/9/2017,"Ok so it seems weird to review Chili's because until last night it seemed like if you've been to one then you've seen them all. However, I have a completely different perspective now! Brought the kiddos for an impromptu dinner since it's just a few minutes from home and we had a very positive experience. Fast service, hot food, and everyone was happy with their meal!  Kids had typical ""kid food""-mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, crispy chicken crispers, mini burgers, fries but everything looked appetizing! I had soup and salad. Warning-the enchilada soup is extremely salty. But our server swapped it out for baked potato soup, gratis. Big thanks to our server ""SHY"".

Amy B.,"Raleigh, NC",1,25,21,2.0,1/19/2017,"Chili's raises my blood pressure.  I went there with a group, and they squished us in so badly, that the person on my left rubbed my shoulder raw with his, and the person on my right had his elbow in my boob.  There was no place for the ladies to put their purses.  They charge for their pub food as if it's high quality.  The burgers are hardened saw dust.  They refuse to not over-cook their meat, and I would wager the cooks are too stupid and impatient to prepare a medium-rare steak.  Waiters rush around as if frightened.  The noise level hurt.  Instead of talking, people screamed at each other.  Two babies were wailing, and of course, the parents were oblivious.  Only kids would like this place, and parents who let their kids rule succumb and give this chaotic place their business.  Thus, the uncontrolled kids and wailing babies.  I wanted this to end, but I was forced to suffer for a full 30 minutes from the time we gave our order until the food came.  Then they got our bill wrong.  But of course they did... who can think in this helter-skelter place?  Grand Central is more calm.  Get me OUT of here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7
Aaron B.,"Raleigh, NC",171,130,58,3.0,10/21/2015,"This review covers multiple visits. The service is generally good here unless you visit within an hour of closing and get seated anywhere but the bar area.  Good luck getting a server to pay attention to your needs as you won't be able to find one.  This happened one night when I came in with a guest and we wanted to chat without fighting over the bar noise.  Server apparently had been tasked with multiple 'closing' chores and was absent for 90% of our visit.  What compounded this problem was that the convenient table-top ordering kiosk was conveniently missing.  That night was so memorable that even on subsequent visits, if that particular server is there, that night will be mentioned with some humor and apologies and extra effort paid.  So...... in essence the issue was mostly fixed. The food. Well... here's the tough part of that.  This food is nearly exactly what you'd find in any similar style restaraunt.  Some good, some bad.  The new dishes are rolled out regularly but none really stand out enough to become a 'standard' order.  I normally stick with the Cajun chicken pasta or a old-time cheeseburger and am generally happy with that.. but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit to have them.  The one thing that will continue bringing me in is sadly one of the same things I can find elsewhere.... the molten cake w/ice cream dessert.  The Chili's version of the Oreo cake deserves a special mention and I suggest you the reader go get one while they are still there.  Oh.. on some visits, if you're lucky, the fries are just........ awesome. What really gives a solid three rating is the Chili's rewards system that gives you points per dollar you spend.  You can use your accumulated points to receive a free beverage or dessert or entree if you have enough.  It's a nice thing to take a look at your check and realize you have enough points to get a $7 dessert to top your meal off for free.

There were people who arrived after us and they got their appetizers long before ours.  When the first batch of chips were delivered, they were sudo hot-cold and greasy, but immediately he came back with a second batch that looked much better.  When our check arrived, (and I advise, get into the habit of scrutinizing your bill) things were added all up wrong which resulted in an over-charge.  Still friendly, our waiter dashed off to correct the mistake and came back with an adjusted tab.  Overall, I would say the meal was, well, okay, not special.  The service definitely friendly, but could use some more training.  Based on last night's experience, it may be a while before our next return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7

Maybe it's the bartender/server that we have come to know, or the fact that they have big beers for cheap, I don't know.  I always get the same thing which, now that I think about it, I don't even know the name. It's a sampler of sorts. Couple that with two big beers, and you've got a pretty good start (or end) to the night.  Not sure what everyone likes, but I'd suggest going to the bar area.

Jon B.,"Raleigh, NC",97,238,164,4.0,12/3/2014,"As far as chain restaurants go, Chili's is probably one of my favorites. I don't go a whole lot, but always enjoy it when I do. The service and the food  I've had at this location have always been very good. Chicken crispers and any appetizer that comes with their chips are always a win for me. I tried one of their new fresh mex bowls on my last visit. Very good, but it is basically it is a burrito bowl. They now have these touch screen menus on the table. We didn't use it much, but I was intrigued by the idea. I guess if the server you get isn't too great you can minimize them by using that. Overall it's chain tex-mex. If that's your thing Chili's is a decent option. If not, you can hop over to some Italian right nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7
