Matt H.,"Orange, CA",218,765,220,3.0,7/26/2017,"Heading down from Big Bear with a group, we stopped here for a bite before the drive back home.  The Yelp app lets you check in early and get on the wait list, which is nice.  Probably the only misstep was that I went tot he bar to get some water and waited for at least 10 minutes before a bartender even showed up, and by then we were seated.  The bar was pretty full, but no one was anywhere to be seen, so I thought that was odd. I like the food here.  It isn't awe inspiring, but the menu is huge and there is a lot of variety, so you should be able to find something you like.  I ended up with the 'upscale' taco plate, and it is tasty and relatively healthy, plus not too expensive.  I also had a couple of margaritas, which I like here quite a bit.  In fact, long ago I adopted the Presidente style (with brandy) as my home margarita style.  Service was very friendly (apart from the missing bartender) so I have no complaints about the waitress. If you go with a group, the on-table payment system makes splitting a check really easy.  You just opt to split it, and then each person ticks off what they ordered and then swipes a CC and puts in a tip.  The waitress does not have to track charges, and there is no arguing over who owes what or trying to tell the waitress put X on this CC, Y on this CC and Z on the last one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands
Gabrielle A.,"San Bernardino, CA",189,5,,1.0,9/8/2017,Went into this nice place for dinner with my boyfriend  We wanted the 2 for 35$ the margarita comes with shakers we got regular cups  Told it was what we ordered. Then when I ordered my food it came out cold the waitress was absolutely rude and got the manager then the manager was no better I had it with chillis. This is absolutely unacceptable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands
Ryan G.,"Highland, CA",15,5,,5.0,1/12/2018,"I had the sirloin last night and it was so tender and tasty that I felt compelled to come on here and say good things about this place. It was honestly one of the five best steaks I've ever eaten. The service, the sides, the speed were all excellent as well, but  my God, the steak was an actual experience for my taste buds. It was so good that I took the time to find out the name of the chef (Isaac, by the way) and I very honestly plan to call ahead in the future and find out if he's working when I go so I'll know it's a good day to get the steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands
Melissa D.,"Redlands, CA",0,46,16,2.0,1/2/2018,"Went to chilis today with the family. We decided on getting 2 of the 2/$22. Comes with one app and 2 entrees. The host working tonight was in a bad mood and had an attitude but our server was awesome. The apps we got were good, the Texas fries and chips and guac.  However, my grilled chicken salad was the worst salad I've ever had , i don't really know how you can mess up something so simple but my chicken was soggy. My moms ribs were good but both the broccoli and corn on the con sides were horrible. If I do ever go back I will stick to just drinks and chips and salsa.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands
Tresa H.,"North Redlands, Redlands, CA",20,6,,3.0,1/6/2018,I know I chose to sit in the bar area but they seemed a little under staffed. Asked for lemons twice and we got them once our meal was almost done. I had to ask for napkins... like get up and ask. It was alright but it wasn't the best experience.

Desiree A.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,1,1.0,12/29/2017,"Very very rude!! Seriously the staff was rude the vibe wasn't cool and felt like we were just being stared at, well to be honest we went thru the wrong door but geesh what a way to make us feel so awkward the staff just stared at us instead of helping us and then we heard two of the girls whispering who knows what maybe because we have a family of 7 +1 and it was intimidating seeing all of us walk in?? Not sure... we waited about 20min before we walked finally don't know why or how they took so long to seat us when there were clearly about 15-25 chairs to the left side of the restaurant anyway they ruined what we had planned and whoever is managing that place should really take more interest in how that place is being ran and how there staff greets customers very very poor customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands
Angela J.,"Yucaipa, CA",81,29,8,1.0,12/4/2017,"Horrible experience. My family went to celebrate my son's birthday. We made a reservation and we all were disappointed by this dining experience. Our server, Buffy, was incredibly inattentive. She didn't get our orders correct nor did she feel the need to check on our table to see how we were doing or if we needed anything...like waters refilled or napkins etc. Needless to say we will not return. Food was not fresh or tasty as it had been in the past. Over cooked rubbery shrimp fajitas, over cooked chicken crispers, undercooked broccoli, over procecessed chicken breast. Its a shame that Chili's is losing our business because I had been a regular customer with my children for the past three years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands
Bianca S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",119,131,294,4.0,1/1/2017,I'm not sure why this chilies has such bad reviews I was actually really pleased with my visit here. I put in an order to go I got the BLT sandwich combo with the chicken tortilla soup. The combo came with the soup and a side of fries. I thought that was a really great deal all for $6 and the portions were a really good side. I placed the order online and it didn't even take 10 mins for it to be ready which I was really happy about.  When I walked in to pick up my order I was promptly greeted and asked if there was anything else I wanted to add. I added a strawberry lemonade and they gave me a huge to go cup of it. I paid and my food was still hot when I got home. The sandwich and fries were delicious but the soup was just a little too salty. Other than that I will order from them to go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands
Micheal A.,"Highland, CA",224,3,,1.0,12/5/2017,"My experience at chili's was.completely unacceptable. The waitress was forcing a smile that made my boyfriend and I feel so sorry for her.  According to our receipt her name is Jax. I had ordered the bottomless soup and salad, which is supposed to mean I can get as much as i can eat. They where out of the loaded potatoe soup, so she said my options where the chili soup and tortilla soup. I had notice that on the menu it was 80 cents extra and she did not mention that untii i brought it up.  Then she brought out my soup and salad and I had asked for a second bowl of soup since she constantly walked by without asking. I had not touched the salad yet and she had the nerve to say that I did ""better than most"". When my boyfriend asked what she meant, she said that usually people don't get more than one bowl of soup. Too make a woman feel insecure, especially in front of my boyfriend,  is despicable. By the way, they are budgeting on napkins so be sure to bring your own!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands
Lupe C.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,66,235,3.0,3/18/2017,"The rating is based on the following besides customer service (which it was good): - Southwestern Eggrolls: good - Texas Cheese Fries: not that impressed. Not sure why it's even offered in the menu and most of my fries were a bit dry. It's like frying frozen fries, cook some bacon, get my canned jalapenos, add some shredded cheese and greens onions and call it a day. I'm just glad I came during happy hour time (some appetizers are cheaper). - Triple Berry Crumble Cake: now this was the real deal, which I have been craving it since the last time I ate it.

Christina N.,"Redlands, CA",7,16,34,5.0,12/7/2016,"I came to eat when they were not busy. I always come here since they are located near where I live. The moment my sister and I came in, an older lady stopped with her cleaning and greeted us immediately, which I thought was great because most places would just stare and wonder when another employee would greet the customers. Therefore, the greeting and seating us was fairly quick.  I love the food. I always eat steak at this place. They always get the steak at the right temperature that I like, medium rare. I am extremely picky with the steak. Surprisingly they never disappoint me.  The server was nice, she came and check up on us multiple times.

Etan G.,"Redlands, CA",0,4,3,2.0,4/17/2017,"Not our first time here but definitely the most disappointing. The two things that you would expect on Easter Sunday : bad parking and a long wait, not on this day. I was able to park up front and my wait was less than 10 minutes. We should have left then, it was all downhill from there. Everything: Staff, service, food etc was awful (apologetic) but still awful. The kicker that warranted this review was my 'doggie bag', I ordered enough so that I could bring some home.

And kids just kept Screaming!!!!! the whole time. Mind you a cry ,shout, a scream happens,but all through the meal is ridiculous!!!! called my a waitress over ,asked if she could get my waitress and told her we had to leave,because the noise was just too much!!!! Not sure if we will go back again,very unhappy dining experience with my mom!!!!!! Think twice after the first couple of screams. As we were walking out another customer said to us sorry!!!!

Courtney A.,"Loma Linda, CA",46,4,,1.0,7/9/2017,"Getting seated was no problem. We waited 35 minutes for 2 appetizers and a burger. Not to mention a couple that was seated after us, received their meal within 15-20 mins. Maybe it was because they had alcoholic drinks. If the kitchen is backed up, that is totally understandable, but the waitress should have told us. Checked in with us. You know... be a attentive server.  Then we finally received our food... the fries were like warm and had the ""old oil"" taste. My daughter's burger was burnt around the edges. The buns on my appitizer were stale and also VERY toasty.  We felt completely ignored. Even the store manager made eye contact with me, but did not even smile. I always tip at least 15%, most the time 20%. But I took my bill and rounded to the nearest dollar. Afterall... tip stands for To Insure Promptness (or prompt service if it's TIPS).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=20

We both settled on the quesadilla explosion salad. It was very tasty, and filling . The chicken grilled yo perfection. I will order the pico de gallo on the side next time. It was a bit too spicy for me.  We also had the side of chili. It comes automatically with cheese. I ordered a side of chopped onion. Which they actually chopped fresh for me. I thought that was special. It's the little things.  Our waitress was so nice , made our whole lunch complete . She came back several times to accommodate my daughter and I .

Linda R.,"Redlands, CA",33,9,,1.0,12/7/2016,"Sadly, before today, I enjoyed Chili's. They aren't always the quickest at getting your order to the table, but the food in consistent, hot and in general, above average. Because I wear  braces, making many foods difficult to chew, I've been ordering--for many, many weeks now-- the chicken enchiladas and asking them to sub shrimp.No problem. A $2 upcharge and everyone was happy. Until today. Today, the waitress couldn't figure out a way to do the simple upcharge, and wanted to charge me for a side of shrimp--6 shrimp for 2.99. That's 2 shrimp per enchilada. I escalated to management, got the same response. No effort to make the customer happy, in any way. We canceled the other order, paid for my iced tea and walked out. I won't be walking back in. This order has never been in question, even at other Chili's in the area and I really liked the dish.

Victor H.,"Redlands, CA",7,7,3,1.0,5/19/2017,"I will advise you not to go to this Chili's. Our party of four spent over $100 on our bill and had to wait 45 minutes to get our food when the restaurant was only half full. After we received our dinner and after we paid our bill, I requested to speak with the manager, Jerry, to express our concern with waiting so long for our food. Jerry immediately told me that our ticket only took 20 minutes to finish which was a lie. I showed Jerry my text message when we were called to our table (9:27pm) and when we got our food (10:32pm). I gave them about 15 minutes to get our drinks and take our entree orders which I thought was fair. All I asked of Jerry was for him to hear my concern and instead he argued with me about the wait time after I showed him the text message again. I was not looking for a gift card or free meal, I just wanted a simple apology or at least for them to take ownership of their mistake. Unfortunately, it hurts me but I will not be back. I just feel as if I was not taken serious due to the color of my skin and I was not heard. Especially given the fact that all of the tables surrounding us (who got there after us) were already eating when we barely received our food.

Then our cheese dip came out tasted good but we found a piece of plastic in it. Our entrees came out only minutes after the appetizers. So the manager came out and said sorry (I bet she says that a lot )    Entrees tasted ok but still not hot. Just warm. So we got a lava cake for our plastic cheese dip and guess what? NO LAVA !! cold in the middle on both of them.  So we got 2 more. Warm lava. Bill came.

Dennis T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",582,846,10004,3.0,9/6/2013,"Diane and I had a pleasant meal here late at night.  I received complimentary Guac, real spicy salsa, and very light and warm Tortilla Chips pursuant to a dining incentive coupon I had received online from the corporation.  The guacamole, with chopped tomatoes and grilled corn, was spicy, cold but not creamy, and very good.  I followed this with excellent Terlinga Chili that was heat hot after stirring.   Accompanying my entree of Country Fried Steak were gravy-laden Mashed Potatoes, real sweet Corn on the Cob, and heavily buttered Garlic Bread.  All on my plate was pretty salty--even a tough piece of meat.  The rest of the Country Fried Steak was suitably tender and tasty. Service was very good amid a loud party ambiance.  And, the food was all very reasonably priced.  We were content!

Sam P.,"Redlands, CA",374,494,251,4.0,12/2/2014,"We've gotten closer to the end of waitstaff. One day, many waitstaff will be replaced by robots.  At Chilis, they've put a touch screen monitor on every table. With this monitor, you can order drinks from the bar, order dessert, see an interactive menu, play games, and pay by credit card (you still have to order your first round of drinks and your appetizer and entrée from a human being).  I bet one day, a robot will bring your order to your table for you while you stare into your phone.  Eliminates all interpersonal interaction. I hate it that they put the caloric information on items.  I didn't want to know that the bloomin' onion was 1,400 calories.  I just want to stuff my face with delicious greasy goodness dripping with ranch dressing.  To save my pants from bursting at the seams, I had the sirloin steak with steamed broccoli with only 250 calories.    It was pretty darn good.   The staff are well trained; they check on you and another one comes to let you know the first one is on break then yet another one comes to bring you your food.  It's like a clown car of waitresses in there.  But at least you know that you're going to get taken care of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=40

We arrived and waited about 20 min to be seated. My husband ordered a cup of chili and was told that they had been out of chili since noon. Really? How do you run out of something and not remake or do what you have to do before the dinner crowd to ensure that one of your biggest sellers (in the name) is available. He made another choice, we waited about 35-40 min for our food before finally asking why it was taking so long. As soon as we asked our food was delivered in less than a minute. It had been sitting in the window and was pretty much room temp when it arrived to the table. We are because we were hungry but we won't be back.

We asked for a discount, not even a comp or free app just a ten percent discount we asked because it was a whole hour. The manager comes out, and starts interrogating us about how long we took to order, he explained that it may have seemed like an hour because maybe we ordered drinks or maybe we needed more time to look at the menu (he was making it seem like we racked up the time), he said but it really 45 minutes according to the ticket and not an hour (fine) and that 45 minutes for a friday night wasn't too bad. We said well why is the waitress apologizing ""for the wait"" if its normal, we dine out all the time and never wait for food that long. he did the discount and said we could pay on the screen, we had been planning on getting a dessert but he didn't even ask us. So we just paid and left. The service was good, food good but not even an apology from the manager.  lThis place has really gone down hill.We were seated,  no one told us about the three course special.

Sat (on multiple occasions) at my table for around 5-10 minutes before getting service and drink refills are just as bad. Also, I always order a margarita and it always is served in a different glass than the last time. Sometimes the margarita comes in a mug, and sometimes it's in a glass. Last piece of advice: bring a jacket. It's freezing in there. If you are just going there for the food, do it. It's cheap and good.

Second, every drink order took about ten minutes to get to the table. The bartender was too ""behind"" to pour a draft beer within a minute or two. My friend got a kids grilled chicken that looked like it had been picked off a buffet platter. So dry the kid could barely eat it. My enchiladas were also crunchy from sitting under a heat lamp.

Nobody even made eye contact or acknowledged us for that whole period of time. Just as we were about to give up and leave the waitress runs up and seats us.  When we were finally seated we ordered quickly and our appetizer came without issue. However, after we finished the appetizer we had to wait for over 30 minutes for our entree... and during that time we received exactly zero refills. We were told we were being served by a waiting team but I never saw the the waiter our waitress was supposedly paired with. Before the entree came a busboy came up and took our plate then told us to pay whenever we wanted. At this point we hadn't received our entree yet and here he thought we were DONE and ready to leave. Probably because we'd just been sitting there doing nothing but waiting for so long. The food was alright when it finally came but it took way too long! I didn't even get to take my leftovers with me because we had to go pick someone up and I wasn't willing to wait who knows how long to get a container. At least they have those tablets you can pay with at the table, or we would have been waiting another 30 minutes to pay the bill. I would NOT recommend going here. The staff shows very little consideration or care and we will not be coming here again.

But there is a difference between the two and that in service and food.  Obviously I only come to this one because it's down the street and closest to my work, so when my sister is in the area and she wants to eat there, this is the one we go to.  While other people have complained about this place, I really can't remember a time where I've had to wait a long time for my food, unless it was extremely busy. When I say extremely busy I mean having to wait at least 30-40 minutes to get table (in which I've only done once.)  For the most part the cooks here aren't bad and neither are the servers. There are some that are questionable, but that's only because my friend used to work here and tell me how much drama they are.  This last time I went here I ordered their shrimp with cheesy fries because those are addicting to eat, even at this location. The sauce with the shrimp is really good, so try it if you decide to come in. The waitress was really nice and honest, she did attend to us in a timely manner, she did forget my sourcream but apologized and brought some. She was really nice. My sister likes the chili here, she couldn't finish it either. I like the molton lava cake, its really good.

Anyways, the waitresses trade off frequently and we never knew which one to talk to or ask questions from. The half rack of baby back ribs I got came with very little fries and was positively horrible. Tasted like it was old and reheated or something. Little to no meat at all, and the sauce was dumped on so thick it was scary.  Damn near could stand a fork up on it...The mariara sauce for the cheese sticks was about the only thing good about my experience here.

First I was thrown off when I walked in, it was a male host with all male waiters on a Saturday night. I don't dock them for this at all I just have never seen a restaurant with all male staff lol especially on a Saturday. So when we get to our table our waiter sits us down and hands us our menus and wanders away. About ten minutes later he comes back to ask us for our drinks. Another 10 minutes and he's back asking for our order. We get a spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer and then some fajitas and chicken fingers. He wanders over to the kitchen for a while then comes back to ask us our order again because he forgot to write down some of it hahaha. When we got our dip I almost choked from laughing... the amount of cheese they put on it was crazy and they somehow cooked it so the melted cheese was fused together in this unstoppable mass. We actually broke every chip trying to separate it LOL. But cheese aside this was by far the worst tasting spinach and artichoke dip I have ever had. Then the food gets to the table and the fajita trio was soo sad looking. It looked like they grilled the life out of the meats and veggies as they were all shrunken and dry. They were so small it looked like only half of the skillet was made. I didn't taste the chicken fingers but my date only ate about half saying they tasted weird.  Like I said usually I love this restaurant but this visit just made me laugh at the whole situation though I will be avoiding this location in the future....

Service is normally great with quick turnarounds for both appetizer and main dish orders as well as drink refills. But last week I lost all faith in my go to place... Ended up having to wait about 30 minutes to an hour to order our food then waited an additional 45/60 minutes for the food to come out. Friend ordered a beer and was brought the completely wrong brand. Drinks were refilled once out during the 2 1/2 hours we were there. Finally we were able to get our waitresses attention (she was talking to friends the whole time) we all handed her our cards and she decided that that was just for fun because she charged my card twice and some cards not at all.

Matt P.,"Redlands, CA",110,25,,2.0,3/26/2011,"So we get a coupon for free chips and queso. I suppose queso in Chili's-speak means ""skillet filled with molten cheese food and meat balls"". I had to add the table ""salsa"" for anything resembling a kick, but hey it was free. The upside was the huge basket of thin, crispy tortilla chips, but maybe that was meant to fill us up before the entrees arrived.  The wife and I ordered a 2 for $20 deal and were happy to learn we could switch out the side dishes. She ordered the Margarita Grilled Chicken while I opted for the baby back ribs. Her take on the chicken was ""uneventful"". The ribs on the other hand were slathered with a spicy-sweet sauce and what I'm sure was liquid smoke, that over powered the rather thin bones. At least the cinnamon apples were good.  Since I was still hungry I started nibbling on the fries that came with my son's kids meal. These little babies must have been brined in salt water, coated in MSG and then dusted with full can of Morton's before being tossed into the serving basket.

I was sick all night and couldn't even go to school today. This place should get an inspection or something. Really bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=120
Christina D.,"Hesperia, CA",43,59,16,3.0,12/6/2010,"I know people don't expect the greatest food from chain restaurants but I usually like everything I get from Chili's. However, my last visit at this location found my husband and I waiting at a dirty table for too long before being cleaned by our server who reeked of cigarette smoke. Guess that smoke break took longer than expected. We received our appetizer and then our dinner about 30 seconds later! This wasn't our server's fault but this has happened at Chili's more than any other restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=120
Johnathan A.,"Garden Grove, CA",23,39,2,1.0,3/6/2011,Yeah our waitress sucked ass. The food was ok. This place left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't think I'll be coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=120

The food was good, the service was fantastic----- our waiters were prompt and responsive, and our food arrived rather quick. The bathrooms were also nice and clean.

Melissa T.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",138,209,6,1.0,7/19/2010,"I went to Chili's on a Saturday afternoon.  I had two children with me (7 & 9) & I ordered the ""bottomless"" soup and salad lunch combo.  The kids each ordered off the kids' menu.  Our server brought out the wrong drinks for us then we never saw him again.  I flagged down a manager who brought us the correct drinks & 25 minutes passed by & we still did not have our food.  I flagged down the same manager who found out our server never entered our order in.  He brought out our food right away but then he too disappeared.  I could see him walking the restaurant but everytime I tried to flag him down he looked the other way, or never saw me.  After not having anyone come by to ask for refills on my ""bottomless"" soup and salad combo, or drinks, I was able to get another manager for our check.  She then brought me the wrong check.  I had to go to the hostess in the front of the restaurant to get the correct check, which was full price!  I even pointed out the awful service I had received & all the manager did was smile, apologize & told me ""I hope you come back and visit us soon!""  No tip was left & I have left this feedback at Chili's main site.  It will be interesting to see if they bother to respond. **Note--I generally like going to Chili's (in San Bernardino) for lunch with coworkers & have nothing against the soup & salad combo I stick to.  I will remember to avoid the Chili's in Redlands and stick to the tried & true San Bernardino store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=140
Steve D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,140,,1.0,1/31/2008,"A trainwreck coming to a neighborhood near you! Lesson learned:  When drinking in a bar don't say ""FUCK"". OK - out of all the crappy, bland chain restaurants I regularly avoid (Applebee's, RedRobin, Denny's, etc.) Chili's was one that you could get me into occasionally.  Fair beer selection and even though the food is nothing to shout about it was at least cooked right and served with some basic level of efficiency. So we went into the new local edition and even the basics were lost.  We saddle up to a tall table in the bar - nice I like these - can see the games on the TVs - so far so good.  I ask the server for an IPA - clueless...  Hello  - you're a server in a bar and you have zero awareness of what is currently a very popular beer style.  An average person off the street would be forgiven but YOU WORK IN A BAR!!!  HELLLOOOO!  So we settle on SNPA - at least they have something with hops. So we're enjoying ourselves in the BAR drinking BOOZE (Note: shelves and walls are filled with BOOZE - definably a bar - check) In the course of enjoying our conversation I said Fuck - yeah the F bomb.  We're in a bar so it's safe right??  Wrong - I got nazi death stares from the next table. Now I don't cuss much but to color a BAR story with a well placed ""FUCK"" is not all bad - right??   Well the chubby burbites at the next table brought little Skippy and Bippy (ages about 10 or 11) into the BAR with them so apparently all the adults in the BAR drinking BOOZE all around them now had to behave as though we're in elementary school.  Whatever... So the food came - a couple of dishes at a time but it got there and pretty much everything was screwed up.  Once the food was dumped off on the table no one came back around until .... mmmm....  yeah  - about Tuesday I think.  I had finished my fries waiting - took for freakin' ever!  As for mine - I wanted no sauce on my burger - it was slathered - once it came back it was wayyyy overcooked unless ""medium"" means leather - I don't know. Took to  long to get the check handled and get out of there too.  Overall not up to the even limited standards of other Chili's I've visited.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=140

Merle K.,"Riverside, CA",0,21,,5.0,12/23/2012,"Never had a problem at this Chili's but it's best during a weekday because of the heavy  shopping traffic on weekends. The Managers here are some of the best I've seen in a Chili's restaurant, so they monitor things fairly well, and if I have any problems (rarely if ever), they square it away especially the GM. The clientele are fairly respectable too, compared to some other Chili's I've been to in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-redlands?start=140

They know when to come and check up on things, and they are always super positive! I recently went there to celebrate my birthday with my frriend and I love the ""Chilis Happy Birthday song"" its so catchy! And the desert is so good! I also very much love the atmosphere of this location! It always is playing great music and its always clean and spiffy!
