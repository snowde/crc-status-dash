Page H.,"Tampa, FL",39,76,103,5.0,6/29/2017,"Came here for lunch today with my daughters. We had an Amazing server. Her name was Taylor. She was happy, and sweet. She anticipated our every need.  Our food was delicious! Probably the best food I have ever had a Chilis. My daughter got the new chicken and waffles. I got the grilled chicken explosion salad. My youngest daughter got cheeseburger sliders with fries. All of the food was yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Jaden W.,"Cedar City, UT",76,1,,3.0,10/21/2017,"The food was really good. I ordered the crispers coated in sauce. It took a while to get our food though. At first the waitress was very attentive, but then once we got our appetizer she kind of disappeared until we got our food, then finally refilled all our empty drinks. At the end, we waited a long time before she brought the check (or told us we are supposed to use the ziosk to pay which we didn't know). Besides her gradually not giving us very much attention, the food was great and everyone else was helpful when we asked questions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Falaniko M.,"Waimalu, HI",518,6,5,5.0,1/12/2017,Our waitress Donica was amazing. We ordered Texas cheese fries and forgot to ask to take off the jalapeños. Without hesitation she brought us a new batch. Service like this is rare and I want to credit where it belongs. 5 Stars for the food and amazing service! Thanks to Donica for making our night!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Steve V.,"Herriman, UT",8,22,1,5.0,6/25/2017,Our visit tonight was great. Food was really good and the service was even better.  Kurt was our server and he worked hard for us.  We didn't have to ask for one refill. He was on top of it. My glass was never below the halfway mark. Offered us more chips when he noticed we were getting low. Really nice job Tonight Kurt.  Kitchen staff did a great job as well. Salads seemed very fresh. All food was good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Garth S.,"Holladay, Salt Lake City, UT",31,12,2,1.0,6/24/2017,"I ordered a sirloin stake cooked medium. The service was really great up to this point. I thought it was strange that the waitress had me cut in to the stake before she left the table. And it was pretty obvious that the stake was way over cooked. She happily took it back to the kitchen. Ok, up to this point I'm still a happy customer. I was really shocked when the cook came out to present his second attempt. He asked that I cut in to it. I could tell that I was quite tender. When I cut in to it it was blue. Rare. Not medium well. He offered to cook it longer but my wife was almost done eating by this time and I didn't want to wait. You know how they serve the steak with a glob o garlic butter?  Well, the stake wasn't even hot enough to melt the butter. I ate part of it that was cooked just right but 2/3 of it was rare and cold. Couldn't eat it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
James D.,"Herriman, UT",60,71,2,4.0,9/14/2016,"Food was decent for what you'd expect, wait staff was attentive and polite. Asked for a substitution on an appetizer, didn't come out that way. Not a major offense but worth mentioning. Only real complaint is that the timing between appetizers and entrees could be improved upon, you end up with too much food on your table and not enough of a gap to really enjoy the appetizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Tiffanie Z.,"Eagle Mountain, UT",1,28,24,4.0,7/2/2016,"This is one of our ""I don't want to cook"" places. April is our favorite server. If you can get her, you should. She is so friendly and nice.  The table side guac is my new favorite and I seriously find myself craving it all the time. I like how they're now making healthier options and giving better flavor to a lot of their dishes, that way you don't feel as guilty when you eat dessert!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Josh M.,"Herriman, UT",15,20,7,5.0,9/24/2016,"Took the two younger kids for some mac and cheese.  I ordered the new sunrise burger.  Everything turned out great.  The food came quickly even on a Saturday.  The mac and cheese was a little chilled, but the kids loved it.  My sunrise burger was so tall I had to take bites like a snake stretching my jaw as far as possible, but it was so good. Our waitress was excellent.  She even remembered to bring what I had forgotten.  For whatever reason, usually most restaurants fail to keep the cheese off when I order food with no cheese.  Not only was there no cheese but she came by to make sure there was no cheese.  Excellent!  She even sent me off with an extra raspberry lemonade in a cup and a note wishing me a nice weekend.   Probably my best Chilis visit yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Joshua S.,"West Jordan, Salt Lake City, UT",100,242,321,2.0,7/15/2015,"This was one of the worst visits I've ever had to a Chili's. The only reason they're getting two stars instead of one star is that they were busy, but there certainly wasn't a line out the door and there were still a few empty tables. But, perhaps they were understaffed or something, because something was off. Not only did we have to wait nearly over an hour for food after we ordered (salads, burgers, fries, nothing too outrageous), but we didn't get drink orders that we placed multiple times. (At least said drinks didn't appear on our bill when it came time to leave). When the food finally came out, it was ""meh"" at best. My wife's salad came to the table in last place, and only after we reminded the waiter of the order. I also hate the nasty, sticky, food-encrusted credit-card readers they have at the tables. As if they weren't unpleasant enough to use, it prompts you to complete a survey every step of the way. While they might be secure enough (I have no idea how secure they are), I FEEL like I might as well hand my card to the nearest stranger and hope that he doesn't do anything with it, and that feeling makes me just not want to use it. Here's hoping that they get rid of the table-side card reader or at least give me the option of not having to use it when paying by card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Sydney S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",122,15,6,5.0,3/10/2017,"Ask for Ali, she's the reason I'm even writing a review haha. She was great! I come to chili's so much i really don't know what to say about it, its always pretty great! I appreciate how clean this location was. Even with the crayon marks on the wall in our booth the restaurant was still cleaner then the one we live by and go to religiously (Midvale).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Vodo L.,"Herriman, UT",0,4,,3.0,12/26/2016,"Let me start with the food is amazing and not overpriced. I recommend the chicken tenders or a burger if you choice..... Second is the service is good not the best ever but good so why do you give it a three star you ask?  Because of the bathroom, a toilet was broken along with a sink and paper towel roller, and it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in 2 years",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Nick S.,"North Salt Lake, UT",20,83,11,1.0,8/13/2015,"There is an obvious problem at this Chilis. We've been here before and it was fine, but the last two times were enough to get it banished from any future visits. The last time we waited with menus for over 20 mins until we finally got up and left. Servers would walk by quickly blatantly avoiding eye contact. The place was dirty and the rest of the tables were filled with neglected customers, though some had glasses of water. Another disappointing chapter in the chronicles of Chilis' downward spiral.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Andrew S.,"Riverton, UT",160,382,102,3.0,11/14/2013,"It's Chili's, and for some that may be all that I need to say - for what it is it's adequate.  However, I also want to make sure my review meets that criteria also, so to avoid it being just one sentence, here's a few synonyms to keep the reader engaged... regular, mainstream, fair, mediocre, ordinary, moderate, middle of the road, unexceptional, tolerable, passable.... I think you get the idea.  That describes Chili's food and service.  If you keep those in mind you'll not be disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Corey B.,"Springville, UT",0,3,1,1.0,12/28/2015,One of the worst Chili's I have ever been to. Took over 1.5 hrs to get our food. Food came out cold..

Tyler S.,"South Jordan, UT",7,54,12,4.0,2/19/2016,I think chilli's is a good chain place. Is it perfect not independent but has good flavors,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Serena B.,"Mineral Wells, TX",41,48,34,5.0,3/4/2016,We recently moved from Texas and it is nice to know there is a place to go that feels like home.  Most food in Utah I have noticed lacks flavor.. but Chili's here is just like the Chili's at home.  I have already eaten at this location twice and I will be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
J W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,6,2,1.0,8/8/2015,Worst location the staff doesn't even care to offer you a drink.  We sat for 10 mins without anyone acknowledging us they sat is next to a table full of loud kids even though we told the hostess we wanted a bar seat.  We just got up and left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Rachel T.,"Anaheim, CA",6,39,11,2.0,8/20/2015,"Came to Chili's for a family birthday celebration so we did have a larger party than usual. I understand that larger parties are more difficult to wait on; however, I don't feel there should be a difference of 30+ minutes from when the first person at the table receives their food vs. the last. By the time the last person got their food more than half of the table was already finished eating. Food and dessert orders just took way too long and food was mediocre. It didn't feel like the waiters were ever rushed to take care of our table when everything was so far behind. Lastly, most restaurants will at least try to begin clearing the table when people are finished with their meals and before dessert, but not one thing was cleared the entire time. There was a table right behind us that left and still within an hour of them being gone not a single dish had been cleared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton
Crystal B.,"Millcreek, UT",33,16,3,3.0,10/15/2015,Service is a hit or miss at most Chili's.. Food is usually great. Had one horrible experience but the manager (beautiful blonde lady) made it right!

Shanie D.,"Maspeth, NY",4,36,4,1.0,4/11/2015,Horrible. Took 40 minutes to get our food. Then it was cold. One beer was wrong?! We are done with Chili's in Riverton!! I would rate it no stars!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton

Frank M.,"West Valley City, UT",497,781,41,3.0,1/30/2015,"I mean it's a freaking Chili's. My salad came with a full quesadilla at the bottom of it and the table as a small TV to play games on it. Expect overweight, middle American, flannel wearing dads shoveling fries and burgers with mayonaise on them into their mouths with their TapOut wearing sons watching college football. Not that any of these things are inherently BAD,  just feel like you can get all these things, of slightly better quality with a little more uniqueness at any local joint.

Tyson J.,"Riverton, UT",0,3,,1.0,2/13/2016,This chillies is the worst every time I go there I get terrible service. Every time I go in I wait a long time for service and a long time for my food. Tonight I went in around 10pm and sat in the bar area. I sat there for 15 min made eye contact with the waiter and he just walked by and helped everyone else. I would not suggest this place if your trying to kill time before a movie or if you don't want to be ignored and treated like shit.

Connie G.,"Kihei, HI",5,3,,1.0,9/19/2014,"After being given a pager we sat outside for the allotted time and then some. We went inside and they had already called people after us and there were question marks by our name. They had forgotten they had given us a pager and then treated us as if it were out fault. Then pointed to a booth in the bar and said sit there. After several minutes pass and still no service, we decided to leave. I'm tired of spending my money at places with lousy service.  I don't frequent chain restaurants often, this reminded me of why I don't.

Nick F.,"Riverton, UT",46,17,73,2.0,1/3/2013,"This is a Chili's like any other, but I have had a mixed bag experience here.  Two good experiences and one horrid experience... but it can happen anywhere I guess. Chili's food has been consistent where ever I have tried it, so that was not surprising.  Memphis Dry rub ribs always work out good, as do the South West Eggrolls.  Margarita Chicken usually ends up dry but was good this time.  Smokehouse burger is nice too. Service is where they can shine...sometimes.  Granted, we are limping out of the holiday season where there is too much to do and never enough time.  No matter how much anyone plans there is no correct answer to the holiday season rush. That being said, it is hard to excuse some of the things that I noticed.  There were a few tables in use that the lights above them were not working at all.  Patrons could not read the menus or see their food for that matter.  Tables were not bussed for half an hour while there was a line out the door in 25F weather.  Found that a bit odd, but they seemed short staffed that night.  Speaking of short staffed, there were 2 people working our area and we saw one almost all the time and our server was MIA most of the night.   We were trying to get our check and leave for about 45 minutes when we decided to start looking for an ATM and just drop cash and run.  Finally our server reappeared, then left to get the check.  Another wait...another apology...  We have been really turned off by this location, but will probably be back sometime as it is too damn convenient.  We hope for the best on the next run.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton?start=20
James S.,"West Jordan, UT",0,4,,5.0,10/18/2015,In the past this Chili's has had horrible service but last night we went in and our server Jacob changed our minds.

Bryan A.,"Herriman, UT",620,61,109,1.0,6/2/2011,"This Chili's is weird. If they are slow, it's generally good. However, if you see more than 4 cars in the lot, KEEP DRIVING!

Kris L.,"Riverton, UT",15,19,20,3.0,6/2/2015,"I used to love Chilis. Ever since I  moved here from Florida I have had many disappointments. They have changed staples on the Chilis menu and not for the good. I can still rely on The Oldtimer. Now they add tomato which I just pick off. They have ruined my favorite which WAS chicken fajitas.  In Florida my daughter and I would eat at or do Carside to Go at least once per week. When I first moved here 4 yrs ago I wasn't sure if it was a Utah mistake in how inferior the food is or if it was a nation wide change. Even the quality of the chicken breast used in the fajitas was inferior in Utah. I would order Carside to Go here in the beginning but stopped for 2 reasons; the food wasn't good and there is no Carside to Go in Riverton, not even in summer. They told me they don't do it here because of ""safety issues"". If they think Riverton is any less safe than Tampa I got news, ridiculous. I have had so many problems with this restaurant I actually contacted corporate through Email. Once inside the restaurant there were so many issues we were given comp currency for our next visit. We used the comp currency at a Chilis in Sandy and the manager came over and wanted to be sure we hadn't received it from their location because as he explained things need to be very messed up for them to give them out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton?start=20
Curt N.,"Herriman, UT",34,47,6,1.0,5/20/2011,went to pick up some food for someone else and noticed a beggar's sign asking for tips next to the takeout register.  I don't tip any other person who assembles the food I ordered neatly into a bag and hands it to me.  Why does Chili's expect tips for the same?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverton?start=20

I got the Spicy shrimp Tacos which came out about 5 mins earlier than the other meals. It was cold when I finally ate it and the shrimp was very chewy. Our server was good but maybe a little too attentive. The Long Island iced tea was okay, a little too much sour mix not enough coke. Probably won't be going to Chili's ever again.

When I got up at the 40 minutes mark to ask she said we were next and it'd be less than 5 minutes... Still over 15. Ridiculus!  We should have just left but we had a gift card.  Our waitress was actually nice and the food came out fairly decent for how crazy it was there, but when we ordered chips and salsa we had to wait for that because they ran out and didn't have any fresh.
