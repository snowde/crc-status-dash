Dave L.,"Rochester, NY",128,157,15,4.0,12/17/2017,I really enjoy Chili's. I have never had a bad meal here. Their burgers are amazing and I love getting the Cajun Chicken Pasta. The staff are always friendly and make sure your needs are met. They are busy so sometimes you have to wait. They have a good beer selection and drssert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Sara D.,"New York, NY",103,466,2000,3.0,6/19/2017,"Every time we have come for lunch the service have been great and we've enjoyed our meal. I came today for ribs and a drink. Try the Mango Frozen Rita.  I love the Southwest Eggrolls and Crispy Chicken Bites. 1/2 Rack of Ribs with Fries rounded out the meal. On Sunday. I sat at the counter to watch the EUFA EURO 2016 match. Life, sipping a Rita, eating Ribs, what could be more pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
John M.,"Rochester, NY",19,140,221,2.0,10/14/2016,"Below average food for high prices. It's not the worst place on earth, but you'll leave letdown, sad, feeling like you were led on. Chili's has really good marketing and advertising - everything looks great on their commercials, their menus instill the same high expectations, they really hype you up. Unfortunately, nothing you get is what you see in the pictures. Everything is bland and loaded with salt. On top of that, prices are high and the portion size doesn't match. Their $2.99 ""Arnold Palmers"" tasted like Brisk mixed with Minute Maid. Don't be tricked into thinking you're getting a nice beverage. It's served in a dinged up plastic mug. The smothered prime rib burrito was pitiful. It tasted exactly like Trader Joe's frozen enchiladas. Exactly. And prime rib it was not. It tasted like the ""meat"" you'd get in a Lean Cuisine. The kids chicken fingers were really fatty, which another reviewer on here mentioned. The food took far, far too long to come out. Service and atmosphere were fine. All in all, it's not that it's a ""terrible place"", it's that they project themselves to be so much more than they are. I'd go to Mighty Taco over Chili's any day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Rachel G.,"Rochester, NY",30,391,52,2.0,2/9/2017,"Update! So the past 4-5 visits have not been great, ranging from mediocre to downright inedible. On our last visit, the restaurant made tortilla chips were both dripping oil and caked with salt, along with a few clumps of chips that had stuck together in the fryer. Eww. I will say the margarita grilled chicken I had was good tasting and somewhat healthy-ish.  I think the kitchen needs to quality control what is coming out, because every time I have visited recently there have been issues like this...either foods over or under cooked, badly seasoned, etc. It's a shame, as the service and people who work here are lovely, and it is a moderately priced, family friendly restaurant. After the last visit though, I would definitely have reservations about returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Mary P.,"Rochester, NY",74,85,359,4.0,2/13/2017,"You know what?  I hadn't been to Chili's in probably a decade, then I went twice within a month.  It's good food at a reasonable price.  Period.  My husband had the prime rib burrito and he was very, very happy.  My kids all had kids meals, and were totally happy.  I wish I had more to say, but service was good and fast, food arrived quickly and was good, and we paid a reasonable price.  Solid 4 stars for a chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Kari C.,"Rochester, NY",198,564,1846,3.0,3/16/2016,"The food and service here are average. Nothing special, but a fine selection to put gift cards to use.  Haven't been to Chili's in awhile, but we figured it was time to put our gift card to use. Typically, I've ordered their veggie quesadilla's with black beans and rice. On our last visit I tried their veggie fajitas which were subbed for the meat ones on the two for twenty special. I was surprised by how good they were and the portion was huge.  Not really sure why this location gets such a bad wrap...been coming here since I was a kid. This Chili's has stood the test of time. They recently updated the exterior and gave the place a facelift. Odd location for a Chili's, but they seem to be hanging on and doing fine in this plaza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Crystal O.,"Greece, NY",8,27,2,5.0,4/3/2017,"I love the food, and service is great!! Had a few minor problems but it won't stop me from visiting my favorite restaurant!! I have to have my mudslide every time I come!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Amy G.,"Rochester, NY",11,1,,1.0,5/26/2017,"This visit was the worst we have had to a Chili's. When we arrived we were told 20 minutes, which is understandablevon a Friday night. What is not understandable is when another party of the same size comes in and is immediately greeted with enthusiasm by the bus boy who clearly knew them.  They were seated shortly after that (long before us). While we were waiting for our order, we were subjected to listening to said bus boy promote his social media accounts to the young ladies at the next table who did not know him. More fails...long wait for drinks and then food. Burger arrived cold. No corn with meal (but on the menu) queso was Brown and gross (the waiter did remove the cost of the queso from our bill and gave me corn to take home. Our waiter was appologetic and he himself did a decent job. Will more than likely not go back, at least to the Greece location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Corrine T.,"Rochester, NY",41,50,31,2.0,1/25/2016,"Haven't been to Chili's in years, decided to go one night last week as I didn't feel like cooking. Service was fantastic, no complaints there; our waitress was friendly, quick, and seemed happy to be there.  The fried pickles were disappointing to say the least, hardly any batter on them at all and pretty hard. My main dish was decent Prime Rib Fresh Mex Bowl, fairly spicy but I thought it was tasty. My husband had 3 tacos and had no complaints, our kids had the mac and cheese and potatoes and there's nothing special about those. I felt it was fairly pricey for what we got. Not a horrible experience but not the best either. If my service had been terrible I would have given this place 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Tanya C.,"Rochester, NY",14,18,6,2.0,3/13/2017,"This use to be one of my favorite restaurants and I must say I've been disappointed on my last several visits and yesterday was no different. Slow service, we weren't given napkins until the end of our dinner. The food was not good, lack of seasoning, small portions of side items. Our waitress hardly checked in us, the food took long to come and not once did waitress assure us it was on the way. Just very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Andrew A.,"Rochester, NY",68,111,187,1.0,5/3/2015,"This Chili's is an embarrassment.  Used to frequent this place, despite it being a chain, the food used to be pretty good. Slowly, the prices went up over the years, to the point where the quality of the food is NOWHERE near the price. I mean, how the hell do you f#%k up chicken fingers? The almost final straw was a year ago, when a waitress brought a water with $h!t floating in it. She laughed when I pointed this out. She probably didn't laugh at my one penny tip.  Decided to give them one more chance recently, with a $60 take out online order. Was the food ready at pickup time? No. Was it ready 30 mins after pickup time? No. 70 minutes later the bartender brought the order out. I looked at her, and just left. There was only one seated table in the place.  Never again Chili's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Jason U.,"Dayton, OH",446,16,17,4.0,1/2/2017,Went for lunch and ordered the prime rib burrito. The cost was reasonable for the food. The waitress was very nice. The only problem I had was the very long wait time. It was 2pm in the afternoon and probably waited between 30-45 minutes for our food. Obviously not the waitress's fault. I would suggest giving people free chips and salsa like a lot of Mexican restaurants will offer. It is a nice gesture and helps ease the wait time. I have been here several times and always have had an above average wait time. Food portions were very good for what I ordered and had a drink refill with no wait so would say the waitress did a nice job.  Definitely a nice and clean place to eat with above average food. Allow yourself some time however as you will most likely have a longer wait time than most restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Kristen P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",336,245,213,1.0,10/14/2015,"Let me start by saying I am only giving a 1 star because the waitress was pretty decent. Also I can't give anything lower. My family and I were seated within 2 minutes. The restaurant was about 10% full so the booth we sat at should have been clean. Instead the booth and flooring was littered with crumbs and random trash. Our server came over and was pleasant but not overly excited about her job.  We ordered Trio appetizer (boneless honey chipotle wings, fried pickles & crispy cheddar bites) - the wings came out CAKED in batter without any sauce on them. It ended up being just fried chicken with honey diping sauce.  The fried pickles came out in a giant clump of batter that wasn't sticking to the pickle slices. The cheddar bites were fine but I wasn't in the mood at this point because my family wasn't enjoying anything else. Chips and salsa for my autistic son were so greasy that the chips were transparent and flimsy. My husband ordered chicken ranchero tacos . He wasn't sure what the taste was so I took a bite and immediately I knew it tasted metallic and very bland My daughter ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The cheeseburger was your plain frozen meat cooked. The odd thing is I don't remember ordering a salt block instead of fries. The amount of salt on the fries was ridiculous! My son who couldn't be more excited about his cheese quesadilla and broccoli that were arriving to the table, then he bit into it. His broccoli was very dry and flakey. I ordered the fish tacos - the entire entree tasted like it was soaking in lime juice. The fish and rice was extremely dry and lacked any seasoning. A pinch of the pound of salt from my daughters fries would've went a long way with my entree. Everything came out together. My food was hot, less prepared hot and more microwave type hot. All the employees appeared to be keeping busy, I would've expected a cleaner environment and much better food for my family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Abhijit K.,"La Jolla, CA",1,2,1,2.0,1/15/2016,"Went here with my 2 year old and wife directly from work as we had our car for service to be picked up around dinner time. This is the biggest mistake happening for Rochester and chili's franchise. I ordered salmon and my wife ordered chicken grill.  My salmon was oily, served with Stale dry rice and stale appearing broccoli. The only thing I liked was the chicken wings and deserts . My wife's dish was disappointing , the chicken was a solid chunk dumped or boiled in chicken stock. The middle of the chicken was uncooked and raw. Ewwwww that's it, the taste is coming to my mouth .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Jennifer B.,"Rochester, NY",1,45,12,3.0,1/19/2015,"If you're looking for a high sodium meal then come here! What can I say? It's a chain and it's called Chilis! I really like to emphasize the ""is"" at the end it makes it much more fun. Chiliiiiiiissssss.   Anyway do not come here very often as it can probably cause congestive heart failure. BUT they have some decent food. Your tongue might burn off and you might run out of burts beeswax keeping your lips from chapping however it is fun. The look is dated to say the least. The sizzling fajitas are still a crowd favorite. Interesting burger choices. You know what you're getting here. Decent chain food that is processed and cooked In a fashion that even if they opened one in Iran your pork fajitas (kidding) will always taste the same! Go to Chilis twice a year and have some fun!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Joshua H.,"Rochester, NY",0,2,,1.0,2/21/2016,"This place went downhill.  Showed up exactly on time for a pick up order we placed online.  Bartender said they were backed up and it would be a few more minutes.  I ended up waiting another 25 minutes.  Once we got home, the food portions were less than half.  I couldn't believe it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Khushboo S.,"Rochester, NY",0,26,21,3.0,2/12/2015,"The food is good only.....But the best is their molten chocolate cake dessert... Yum something worth trying guys...

Matt L.,"Spencerport, NY",0,5,1,1.0,7/30/2015,"New menu out, photos looked excellent and clean, so I ordered the new prime rib tacos. Bad decision.  They put the avocado and cilantro on top then stuck it under a heat lamp to the point where the avocado was warm mushy lumps and the cilantro was wilting and crispy. Requested fresh avocado and dug in. Picked it up and the bottom of the tortilla shredded in my hand with the first bite leaving me with a dripping mess of steak, pico de gallo, and 1/2 soggy 1/2 crunchy tortilla. By the second one, I was eating taco salad off a plate because of the mess. Didn't even bother with the third one.  Great marketing, terrible delivery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
John R.,"Rochester, NY",1,18,3,2.0,7/25/2015,"First lets start off with dinner, i ordered chicken fingers , mind you chicken fingers are suppose to have chicken in them... Welp NOT mine!!! They were terrible and had so much fat in them , Maybe they served the wrong part of the chicken idk but how do you f#%k up chicken fingers! LoL Anyways onto dessert......I Ordered a molten chocolate cake for dessert and received a chocolate chip cookie, and it was a rip off besides 9$ for a brownie and some ice cream ,come on chilis....other than that screw up , that pretty much sums up the joint ....halfway decent greasy food.... But people love it! The place is still busy every night. Also the dated decor which takes me back to the 1980s is very nice... And its so bare and dark in the place it makes me feel like im sitting in a cave! On another note how do you only have 1 TV in the dump!  Fix yourself chilis",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Ashley S.,"Rochester, NY",0,3,,2.0,1/15/2017,"For a corporate restaurant, this place is beyond disappointing. I'm not one to typically write a review because I work in the industry so I never want to put another restaurant down. But this place needs work. My boyfriend and I stopped in for a quick lunch because our cars were getting serviced. We sat down and were not greeted right away. Our server was pleasant but not overly optimistic about her job. I ordered a turkey sandwich and my boyfriend ordered a sampler platter. Half an hour later our food comes out. My sandwich was fine, nothing to brag about though. My boyfriends platter was ice cold. Not even luke warm. Our server never checked back, so we had to flag someone down to take it back. Our server never even knew that we sent it back. 20 minutes later the re-make comes out and its not steaming hot, but at least its semi-edible this time. A manager never came over to make sure everything was okay. (not looking for free food but some sort of compensation for an hour and a half lunch would have been nice). This place definitely needs to put in some work before we ever spend $40 on below average food ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester
Josh G.,"Spencerport, NY",196,254,285,2.0,3/21/2014,"I came upon this store of red... Only for my soul to be filled with dread... The parking lot was congested like a sack... So I urged my family to turn the car back... But to no avail, they carried on... As the chili peppers flashed twice and then were gone... The floor was dreadful more or less.. Looked like someone had forgotten to take care of a mess... People huddled together like a crowd at a parade... I sighed softly wanting to leave this charade.... And with that a woman with a heartwarming smile... Led us past the groups of diners and into our aisle... The menu was vibrant and gleamed with ease... Just as the couple behind us let out a loud sneeze... A waiter arrived by the name of Jake... Who happily took our orders and recommended the steak... I slurp down my water in my plastic glass... So hungry I could even eat grass... To my joy, he strutted back towards the table.... Placing plates of paradise in front of our faces to keep us stable... With no more restraint, we dug right in... But the food tasted like it just came from a bin... With our stomachs still quite not full... We left ten bills of fortune and went back into the bull... With forty dollars nearly lost... I won't be trudging back there at any cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester?start=20
Lynn O.,"Rochester, NY",0,1,,2.0,5/7/2016,"Last evening was told the wait would be 20 - 25 minutes. We said fine we will be at the bar. After 25 minutes I checked with hostess to find out we had been called already. No one came in to bar that we heard. This is the second time this has happened, last time we waited almost an hour before inquiring to find out we had been called and skipped over.

The Count V.,"Rochester, NY",64,147,30,3.0,2/26/2013,"I've come to Chili's for a pretty long time. I mainly came with the family, but my finacee has come along sometimes as well.  The restaurant is in a good sized plaza off of Ridge Road. Upon walking in, you face the bar area straight ahead and dining areas on either side of the building. The left side is bigger and is where people usually get seated first. They have different sized booths and tables that can seat up to 6 people snugly. The menu is kind of a blend of Tex-Mex and American. We like their appetizer/entree combos (2 for $20 types of deals). I have had most of the items on the menu. Like most other chain restaurants, the food obviously isn't anything to write home about. But regardless, it's consistent and certainly not bland. I like their fajitas, especially the mixed. They used to have a tuna steak sandwich that was $8 and had a fairly generous portion of tuna. I miss it dearly, for they didn't overseason the tuna and it was almost always cooked just right. They have a poor selection of beer, but I'm glad to say that they do support the local brewery by having some selections from Rohrbach's on tap. The ambience is of a casual restaurant that has a pseudo-texmex feel. Come here with a group of chill friends and have a good time out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester?start=20
Alyse M.,"Rochester, NY",24,34,36,3.0,9/24/2015,"I live 10 minutes away from Chili's and I never thought once ""Lets go to Chili's for dinner"" so finally it popped in my mind to go there for dinner. So I tried it out and when I got there I was agreed by the hostess who decided to seat my father and I in the back of the Restaurant which confused me because everyone that was in the restaurant was being seated in the front... So I asked to be moved into the bar section .. which when I was finally moved the hostess seamed all confused and basically let me pick my own table. Now I know servers had certain sections but the server who was gonna be ours in the back of the restaurant was serving in the bar section too which confused me as why I was seated in the back. But on to the next subject ... the server we had was very helpful and knowledgeable or the menu and recommended some things for us to first being our first time at Chili's. The food was really great we got shrimp and steak fajitas and upgraded to the premium rice ... and it was terrible it literally tasted like soap it was so dry and tasteless. Not sure If ill ever be coming back to Chili's there are much better restaurants in the area I would rather go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester?start=20
Daniel S.,"Canandaigua, NY",0,12,1,1.0,12/19/2015,"If I could give them no stars that would still be too high.  Horrible food. Too spicy. Taco Bell is like a five star restaurant compared to chilis.

Jackie R.,"Rochester, NY",22,54,1,4.0,10/13/2014,"If you're looking for increasingly popular appetizer of jumbo soft pretzle sticks - this is the place! I get pretzle sticks often because I love them and Chili's time and time again has absolutly perfect ones. They come out looking menu picture perfect and taste great! Usually we come here during happy hour which is great - 1/2 priced appetizers, $1 off drinks, free bottomless chips & salsa = deliciously cheap. For example we were there last night we ordered the chips & salsa, guacamole, queso dip, soft pretzles (duh), half order of fries and beef nachos it came to about $14 - how can you beat that?? And we had a great waitress. We always find ourselves here, especially for football games but how can you beat lots of good food and great service for not alot of money?

K P.,"Brockport, NY",5,43,37,2.0,3/29/2014,"Chili's used to be my favorite restaurant and I used to come to this location all the time. But there are a few reasons I will never go back even though I have given it multiple chances since my first bad experience. On one occasion we were eating and the cougars from the bar were being loud and obnoxious as usual. We were at a table in the dining room and ordered the chips and salsa and we're eating when all of a sudden a projectile came flying across the roomand landed in our salsa. Yes, some dipshit from the bar shot corn through a straw at our table. And no our food was not replaced. Everytime we went we ordered the skillet queso. And 75% of the time their was foreign debris in it. But at least the waitresses were always nice enough to apologize and take it in the back and pick the debris out for us? On another occasion someone I was eating with hung their coat on the coat hook in the dining area. It was lunchtime and there was only a few other tables in the restaurant. About 15 minutes into our meal we saw an employee going through the pockets of the coat. The excuse was they were just moving it. Last but not least, I was eating lunch at one of the end booths during the holiday season and the person I was dining with went to use the restroom. Not a minute later, the manager was crawling in the booth seat setting up Christmas decorations. If u want to eat at Chili's, go to the one in Henrietta. Much better food and the staff don't look and act like they just crawled out of the dumpster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rochester?start=20

Brian M.,"Kendall, NY",2,8,,2.0,8/15/2013,"This has always been a place my family has gone to while other restaurants had large waits. Typically Chili's can get you in sooner. The food is OK for that of a chain restaurant, but it won't blow your mind. Recently I went with my fiancé and children after a game of put-put. I ordered a single beer and the family ordered their drinks. About 15 minutes later the waitress had came back to inform me they were all out.. Angered a bit by the long wait, I said fine and ordered something else. An HOUR later our food finally arrived. A whole hour. (This eatery was NOT by any means busy) This is outrageous in my book. When we finally got the bill I was rushing as it was getting late and I wanted to get the kids to bed. She brought the cheque and I simply handed my card to her. Upon signing the bill, I had noticed my beverage I had ordered (that was not in inventory) was charged along side my drink. Needles to say, she wasn't left with a very nice tip.
