Davis P.,"Rockford, IL",187,100,433,4.0,11/27/2017,"My friend and fellow Yelp friend couldn't decide where to go in town for food and name off a couple places but wanted something different. We decided to come to chilli's because we haven't been there in years so we decided what the heck, why not.  We got in and they greeted us right at the door. We decided to sit at the bar since it was slow and figured we would get our food a lot quicker. The bartender came out to greet and take our order. She was very nice and recommended the margaritas since they are on special. I ended up getting fajitas which were very delicious. It was sizzling hot and came with the tortillas and a few sides such as cheese, sour cream, guacamole, etc. Overall, it was a typical experience at Chili's. The service was good, food was delicious and hot, and we got to pay on the knew pay kiosk that each table has.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Angela S.,"Milwaukee, WI",53,98,,4.0,10/15/2017,"I don't know why this location is getting so many bad reviews. We dined here last night and the place was busy.  The food, drinks, and service were just as good as any other Chilis we've been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Abijit R.,"Quincy, MA",0,5,,1.0,10/13/2017,"I wanted to give -5 stars but that's not an option. Here's how it works at this place, if you want lemonade-order coke, if you want burger-order pasta and yes once your order keep guessing. Don't you like surprises... come on...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Ryan D.,"Rockford, IL",17,3,,1.0,4/29/2017,Food was cold and it looked like it had been sitting a while. The wierd thing is it didn't take long for it to arrive at the table. I did not eat it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Rae B.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,55,11,1.0,1/12/2017,"Hubby ate there last night - chicken was lukewarm; all food poisoning symptoms have kicked in. Diner beware! If it's not cooked as it should be, send it back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Dan B.,"Roscoe, IL",0,2,,1.0,4/28/2017,Do not get the smothered smoked chicken burrito. It is 95% rice. There is more chicken on one wing than there is In this burrito. I am not sure if this is the standard Chilis recipe or the local Managment. Chips and salsa were solid though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
James S.,"Rockford, IL",4,1,,2.0,10/20/2016,Food was ok but very poor service. Took long time to order food. Very long time waiting after we ordered. It wasnt even busy when ww gir there,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Sebastian R G.,"Rockford, IL",93,73,24,3.0,9/25/2015,"Took some time to attend us, and we came on a Sunday night. Not busy at all; but took about 10min just to take our order of our drinks. After the 10min the server came and said ""I'm not your server but I can get your drinks started, (so and so/girls name) will take care of you and is your server"". The guy brings us our drinks and states that he'll be our server, because he doesn't know what's going on with our main server. Uh, get your stuff together. Figure out who's taking care of who. Now the guacamole is phenomenal here! Give that a shot. I had a southwestern burger with bacon. Rare. It was very delicious.  Actually liked the food here better then the Chili's in Wisconsin to one I went. Just fix the place up. It's clean and everything. Just the place is a bit rundown, maybe do some updates to the facility. (9-20-15)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Cynthia C.,"New Orleans, LA",91,197,186,2.0,6/19/2015,"We went last night for a late dinner. We each had chicken or beef enchiladas. Service was good but everything was very salty, making it all taste the same. Not terrible but not very satisfying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
R. M.,"Green Bay, WI",0,15,3,1.0,8/15/2016,"Well we're do I start... Daughter, grandson and I got there around 7:30 pm. Slow night, we ordered steak and cheese nachos with jalapeños for me, and steak cheese queso nachos for the two of them and a side do chips and salsa for the table.... Nachos came out, both orders wrong, waiter took them back, replaced them and still both orders wrong.... Manager came over and started arguing with my daughter telling her special orders screw with the cooks... Lol... So my daughter said, ""so it's my fault?""  The manager said his cooks don't do special orders well... I said ok, I will pay for the chips and salsa and one order of crap nachos, which I did. It cost me $21.00 for the three of us, a pretty cheap price to learn I will never eat at a Chili's restaurant ever again... P.m. Manager is a moron",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
David T.,"Rockford, IL",115,19,7,1.0,4/3/2015,I was not happy with the food. Service was great. But i ordered a steak medium and came well done sent it back. While waitting i was nibbling on my fries and onion rings. Had a very very bitter taste to it as it was super old oil or somwthing. Theee fore i complained explaining to the manager my problems i had and she decided to subtract15$ witch was ok. And i thank her but then i lost my appetite. As soon as i left i had a smoke and still had a lingering bitterness to my. Tastebuds.  I generally am ok with the food but today ate the cake where i shall.not be visiting chilis on state st anytime soon. Again service was great cooks are horrible. To be quite frank i woulda thought the whole bill shoulda been comped due to me not taking new steak barely eatting and having a horid taste in my mouth witch i expressed deeply to the manager  on duty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
MIchelle D.,"Poplar Grove, IL",60,19,2,3.0,4/8/2014,"No one greeting, and seating hostess in the back.  Sat down few minutes drink orders taken quickly. Appetizers just ok. Entree mango chicken,  loaded potatoes,  forgot my corn on the cob. Potatoes cold,  broccoli  dry flavorless. Margarita was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Andrew R.,"Rockford, IL",57,18,2,3.0,1/13/2014,"Trying to review a Chili's is like trying to review any other fast-food establishment -- the corporation puts a lot of care into making a consistent dining experience. This makes it hard to rate. Chili's on the whole is a 3-star experience, but this restaurant would probably rate as a 5-star on the spectrum of other Chili's Restaurants. Essentially, once you been to one, you've been to them all. That being said, Chili's is basically one level above Wendy's. The food may be a little fresher, they serve alcohol, and you don't have to refill your own drinks.  We did have a subpar experience recently, but I'll refrain from posting it here, as we spoke with the General Manager of the establishment, he apologized profusely for the problem, and offered us a gift card in the hopes that we'd return and have a better experience next time. I would return to Chili's. They have a lot of food options that make it convenient for a large party with a lot of different tastes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Jeff J.,"Rockford, IL",0,12,,1.0,6/4/2015,Not very buys Sunday night. Bartender took the drink order fairly quick. Once food was ordered it took 25 mins and then when it finally came out the food was cold. Brought it back to the kitchen area because the server was no where to be found and gave the food directly to the manager and told him after 35 mins that I didn't want the food any more. They took half of the 2 for 20 off and knocked off 5 bucks. Not once did the manager come out to see if there was anything the could be done to make it right. He left the server out there on her own. Contacted Chilis corporate via email and not one word back. No phone call no email nothing. Side note during the week is a girl named Jess that works the bar area. She makes sure you are taken care of.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Mike S.,"Belvidere, IL",107,87,24,3.0,2/9/2013,"Food is good, but one dinner was wrong. Place is kinda run down. Needs to be remodeled badly inside. Service was polite and good. Just the one issue that one dinner was wrong, but it was corrected quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Paul K.,"Elgin, IL",0,10,2,1.0,11/7/2012,Worst place to eat service did not like that I sit down an hour before close and I would not mind that the food was bad three times and not a charm no luck in change they need to show them the vidoe give them the pickle. Please just think before u go do u want crap ass food and to be a inconvenience to a person I still tipped heavy not like it matter cause the manger was no where to be found. Get a group of ppl that want to be there,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
Ashlee D.,"Loves Park, IL",0,3,,1.0,3/7/2014,"We usually go to the mâchésney park location, just a few miles away. I now know why we do ! 1st had to wait 10 min before we were even offered a glass a water . We ordered the $35 dinner for 2 and had a coupon for a free appetizer which we get & use often at other locations with no problem. We presented the coupon to our waitress & she stated she could not accept it, because it states on it not valid for the 2 for $20 meal. WE DIDNT ORDER THE 2 FOR $20! WE ORDERED THE 2 FOR $35! She then stated let me check with my manager. ( Please do ) The manager comes over to us & says "" you guys have a question? "". Don't you think the waitress should have briefed him on what was going on?? She stated SHE was going to talk to him. NOT send him over to us. We simply showed him the coupon & stated we ordered the 2 for $35, so whats the problem..... This so called ""manager"" stated he understood where we were coming from BUT we already get a appetizer & dessert with our meal. OK AND SO ?????? ( If we didn't want a second appetizer, we wouldn't be going threw this ridiculous drama ) After making a scene for a good 5 min, this ""Manager"" rudely said "" fine, what do you want for your 2nd appetizer"" while looking at us up and down as if we didn't need anymore food. What he does next just blows my mind! HE personally goes and get us the chips & salsa & brings it to us NOT EVEN half filled!! Seriously looked like it was someones left overs!!  I will be contacting corporate over this visit. We didn't go there to spend that much $, to be treated the way we did. Its unacceptable. Plain and simple.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockford-2
