Brennan M.,"Spring, TX",1,85,29,4.0,12/14/2017,"For a chain semi-finer dining establishment, you'd expect middle-of-the-road burgers because they can get away with it, but BEHOLD! Chili's upped their game a year or so back and shook up their menu (and perhaps kitchen staff.) The food is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Steve M.,"North Richland Hills, TX",61,70,,1.0,12/30/2017,"Stopped here while traveling through Rockwall on the way to somewhere else. Took my hungry family into Chili's and immediately had a bad feeling - it looked chaotic. There was nobody at the front greeting customers, so we stood and waited. And waited. And waited. Despite there being many empty tables, nobody came to seat us. Multiple employees walked right past us without acknowledging us. After several minutes of this we looked at each other, said ""Enough,"" and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Summer D.,"Rowlett, TX",60,5,3,5.0,10/5/2017,Enjoyed a family dinner night at Chili's. The beef fajitas were delicious and the serving size has increased to 12 oz.. We absolutely  their chips and hot sauce with ranch. They also have the best ice tea in the south. The wait staff is very attentive and kept our ice tea glasses full. Our entire family enjoy our time at Chili's!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Samantha R.,"Rockwall, TX",31,32,7,5.0,9/19/2017,"Staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. Chili's recently reduced their menu but did not reduce on flavor! The menu was back to classic with a little flare for everyone. My bacon cheeseburger was right on the money at 9.99 and the flavor was so amazing thee wasn't anything left on the plate. Children's menu has a great variety for all the picky eaters and my daughter actually finished half her meal! Which is a lot considering the potions. She enjoyed her cheese sandwich so much she wanted to take it and fries to lunch tomorrow! Lol! food prep time to table was excellent and the right temperature. My server Ali was excellent and very energetic, he checked on us regularly and our drinks were always full. The service I received and the delicious food will encourage me to make this a regular stop in favorite restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
John H.,"Rockwall, TX",39,73,14,5.0,9/13/2017,Great place to grab a quick bite to eat! Food is good prices are good what else can you ask for? The rockwall location is a great one!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
christy t.,"Rowlett, TX",291,19,4,3.0,7/20/2017,"This place is always busy sitting next  to Applebee's, but I have no idea why considered Applebee's has much better drink specials and their food is delicious. I have been to Chili's 3 time and at best their food is mehhh. And there is always a long wait and the service is blah. But they are very clean at least!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Shannon B.,"Rockwall, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/31/2017,This has to be the nastiest Chili's I have ever been to. Staff standing around and floors are filthy and it smells in there. The food was soggy and tasteless. Will never come back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Dave R.,"Royse City, TX",17,72,44,2.0,2/25/2017,Wow this place needs a new manager! A dozen people standing around waiting and there are empty tables all over! Bussed and ready to go. Wierd. ....

Richard Y.,"Dallas, TX",174,1,14,5.0,3/22/2017,"Ashleigh in the bar provided great service to us last week. My daughter and I stopped in for lunch. She was very energetic, kind  and efficient. I will def return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Lizzie H.,"College Station, TX",73,27,43,1.0,7/14/2016,"Been sitting for 40 mins. The tables next to us were sat a while after us, they were helped first AND already have their appetizer and drinks. We have drinks but are still waiting on our appetizer. Btw, there is only two of us! Probably the worst Chili's experience ive ever had and its one of my favorite restaurants!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Roderick J.,"Rockwall, TX",29,162,25,3.0,1/9/2016,"Well it's just good, tried something different the slider appetitizer very good and part of the trio we had the bbq honey wings and the corn bites all good the meat in the sliders was tasty.  The rest of the table had a burrito bowl very tasty all in all a solid chilli's visit",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
John W.,"Rockwall, TX",0,11,1,3.0,4/4/2017,I'm always happy with the my food when I come here. The food is always perfectly on point. Although I'm deducting two start simply because the last couple of times I got shoved in a back side corner area that was filthy. The service wasn't as good as usual. Now I know I need to request a certain area to get better service I suppose. The left side as you walk in I believe is where all of the rookies serve. You want to ask for the right side of the building.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Rebecca M.,"Hawaiian Gardens, CA",75,3,1,1.0,3/17/2016,On one of the busiest nights (St. Patrick's day AND March Madness) our waitress Kayla decided to spend more time chatting with her friends sitting at a table vs serving her tables. She didn't pay us any attention.  I had to flag down another server to refill my drink. The only time that the service got better was after her friends left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Brittany B.,"Rockwall, TX",0,19,,1.0,12/21/2016,"If I could give zero stars, I would. I have tried NUMEROUS times over the last five years to give it a chance. This place is always disgusting, & never crowded enough to be that way. I would rather drive to the Chilis in Rowlett than come here. Most recently, the table I was sat at was covered in grease, as well as the booth seats, & the floor was covered in chips, trash, bread, & crayons...the hostess just repeatedly cleaned off tables & dumped everything into the floor & then NEVER swept it up. Thus, the whole place was trashed. The restaurant had MAYBE ten tables being served, & there was trash on 50% of the empty tables. We ended up leaving because it was just gross...I'm pretty sure another couple after us did the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
John W.,"Garland, TX",0,24,,1.0,7/25/2016,wow should have listened to the reviews and avoided this place.  wait staff were friendly if not harried but thats all that was good.  Table was sticky even after cleaned.  food was thrown together.  Mashed potatoes with gravy looked like it was sitting outside long before served gravy was hardened on top and dried out.  atmosphere was sort of dingy dirty dive like.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
R. W.,"Garland, TX",1,39,3,2.0,7/24/2016,"Family dinner on Sunday night didn't seem to be busy but service real slow.  Didn't check on refills till dinner was over .  We paid by using machine on table because waitress didn't bring check.  But she was quick to keep table behind us served, food was cold when we received it.   Very disappointed, chills by our house is always fast clean and staff very attentive..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Julie L.,"Rockwall, TX",4,38,10,1.0,8/10/2014,"Why do I keep doing this to myself? Went last night with 2 adults and 3 children. My guest is a vegetarian and wanted cheese instead of chicken enchiladas.  They couldn't do that, which tells me that they come pre-packaged. We all ordered at the same time. The youngest wanted plain cheese nachos with sour cream. That's not what he was served. Of course, we sent it back. Luckily the manager was walking by and retrieved the nachos from the kitchen, no sour cream. It finally came and we practically had to wake the kid up.......poor service, took too long.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Dan C.,"Rockwall, TX",1,13,,1.0,4/9/2016,"We walked over from the tire place to get some food while the car was being worked on. It was about 3:30 on a Friday afternoon. There was nobody at the front. Eventually someone came over from a table and seated us. We waited about 5 minutes and not one person came over to even get our drink order. I finally just got up and walked next door. I would have had a suggestion should anyone have been at the front to ask me why i was leaving or how things were. But still not an employee in sight. We used to frequent the restaurant, and I remember why we stopped. It seems to be very poorly managed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Laurie B.,"Heath, TX",2,30,11,3.0,7/7/2015,Would have been four stars but service was just ok and definitely could have been better. Forgot our chips and salsa. Had to reorder. Our drinks were warm with hardly any ice. Lunch specials were yummy!  Had dirty silverware and no salt on the tables when we arrived. Had to bring it out later.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Laurey W.,"Rockwall, TX",117,19,,1.0,5/12/2015,"It was awful.  A couple of years ago I got a horrible case of food poisoning from chicken enchiladas.  Only went back (against my better judgement) because of a work luncheon.  Service was awful, restaurant was dirty and no lie...it took an hour to get our food.  Will NEVER go back no matter what.  You need new management!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall
Deborah O.,"Garland, TX",1,21,17,4.0,1/16/2015,"I had the Santa Fe Chicken salad. The salad was great but it needed more avacados. The waitress gave great customer service. Over all, one of the better Chili's locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
Hannah N.,"Rockwall, TX",0,4,,2.0,8/7/2015,Service is alright. I think the service at the later hours are more enjoyable. Honestly the only reason why I keep coming back here is because the molten chocolate lava cake is amazing. My friends and I are fanatics about it. Most of the time one is not enough between us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
Nathan B.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,6/6/2015,It was awful. Took an hour to get the food out to us. Half of the food was cold. The manager did come out to apologize and tell us that they were short on cooks but did not offer to at least comp an appetizer or anything. Future family get togethers will not be here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
Erica Dreadedup C.,"Irving, TX",35,18,6,3.0,12/21/2014,"We went here today for my little nephews birthday. It was ok. Service was fast the food was hot, and the server was nice. We had a pretty big party so he tried his best, but he was on top of the drinks. The bathroom wasn't that clean and my nephew wanted a cookie monster for bis bday and they didn't have one! Really disappointing. They had a good happy hour and the cowboys game was on so that made up for the missing cookie Monster. It wasn't worth the drive from Irving tho so next time I will stick to the chili's near my house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
Cyrus A.,"Rockwall, TX",2,8,,2.0,10/1/2014,"I certainly agree with the other recent reviews in that Chili's was formerly good but is now below-average on a good day.  I have identified two culprits: (a) they are apparently using much lower quality ingredients, and (b) they have butchered the menu, including removing or materially altering many of my favorite dishes.  Chili's needs to turn back the clock to about 5 or 10 years ago to win me back as a consistent customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
Nichole D.,"Royse City, TX",3,30,4,1.0,7/19/2012,What happened to this place? It use to be so wonderful! Last few times I've gone to this Chili's it was dirty. Tables everywhere were just left messy and the floor covered in food and trash. Even the tables I have been sat at lately were covered in crumbs.  The waitresses I've had lately have been extremely slow and not very attentive or nice. What is up with their water? Do they not use filtered water? I know water in Rockwall isn't the greatest but everywhere else I've gone in town has great water. The water here has always tasted like cleaner. So much so that I've been afraid of drinking it. I have also experienced dirty cups and utensils several times. The burger that I always get has been good and the fries sometimes way over seasoned but that's just a minor gripe. After our last experience here I won't be going back. It just wasn't pleasant. I felt like I was at some grimy cafeteria.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20

Jeff P.,"Rockwall, TX",15,23,8,2.0,1/24/2014,"Rockwall Chili's has been consistently good for years. Unfortunately, the quality of the good has been steadily going downhill. Buffalo wings and Fajita trio were very disappointing tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20

Chari C.,"Royse City, TX",76,8,9,1.0,2/2/2014,"I love Chili's. ...but tonight SUCKED!! When my daughter and I walked in, they looked at us like we were lost and asked us ""how can we help you?"" Well, yeah. ..we wanna EAT! So they sat us down at a dirty table...then when I got my boneless buffalo wings, they were dry! I asked for a manager and he brought out some more. ..but he only brought out 1 order, when I clearly ordered 2! I'm pissed. So the waiter asks if I want him to bring me a side of sauce for the cold wings...by this point, I want him out of my face.

Wendy J.,"Herington, KS",22,39,16,4.0,11/29/2013,"It's a Chili's...a chain, so the food is predictable.  But the service at the Chili's is very good. From the greeters to when we left, everyone was nice and accommodating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
Mark R.,"Royse City, TX",30,29,18,2.0,3/18/2013,"The service was horrible... waited 35 minutes for three entrees. The restaurant was only about 1/4 full, our waiter had 2 tables to manage and I still found myself filling our water glasses on my own.

KP P.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,2.0,6/4/2014,"Had the Country Fried Steak at this Chili's a couple of weeks ago.  Unfortunately, the steak was undercooked and too chewy for me.  Hoping their meat purveyor will take this as good feedback to upgrade their quality of this steak.  If you happen to be in Arlington and want a really good country fried steak - check out the Division Street Diner - theirs is awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
Jen M.,"Denton, TX",24,52,8,4.0,2/24/2009,"This Chili's is one of the best in the DFW Metroplex. The restaurant is always clean, including the restrooms.  Apetizer: We started off chips and salsa with queso. The chips were fresh and hot, as always and the salsa was better then I remembered. It's not too hot and it has a very nice taste to it. I usually go through 3 bowls. My husband enjoyed the queso, but I think it tastes a bit generic. You will have to be careful not to fill up on the chips before your meal arrives. Drinks: I ordered the Sunrise Margarita and my husband had Dr.Pepper. Our drinks were immediately delivered to us. Don't let the girly look of the Sunrise Margarita fool you, this drink was deliciously strong. My husband never had an empty glass. Our waitress would refill his glass every time it was half empty.  Dinner: I ordered the Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken and a side of pico de gallo. My husband ordered the Fajito trio. Both arrived in less that 15 minutes. My salad was enormous. It contained the perfect amount of croutons, Parmesan cheese and steaming hot chicken. My husbands dinner was also a large proportion. We were both satisfied with our delicious food. Ambiance:  Very nice. Colorful tables, everything is newly renovated/ decorated, nice lighting, nice background music, clean and fun, tv's in the bar.. Pros: Managers are always available & often check on guests to assure a great experience, Large proportions, reasonable prices, full bar, Seat yourself at the bar area without a wait, friendly staff Cons: Now non-smoking, Does not offer sweet tea like some other Chili's, usually you will find the host/hostess goofing around",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
Robin M.,"Royse City, TX",85,15,,5.0,3/29/2011,"I love going to this Chili's.  The service is fast, friendly and the food is great.  We like doing the happy hour food specials in the bar.  They have the best bartender in my book ... we come in and out usuals hit the table.  Great place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
Donovan B.,"Lavon, TX",5,3,,4.0,2/19/2012,"My wife and I ate here yesterday.  It was busy but we were seated quickly and did not have to wait.  Our waitress was very friendly.  Currently they have a two for 20 meal, and we got that and both chose 6oz. Steak, mashed potatoes, and steamed broccoli.  The appetitizer we chose was the guacamole.  The time between ordering and being served was perfect, and we were munching on our appetizer during this time, which was good.  The steaks came out and honestly were really cooked nicely.  I just cut in and ate, no steak sauce needed.  The mashed potatoes had Bacon, cheese, chives, and were also great.  The broccoli had just a touch of seasoning and tasted good.  All in all, very good meal at a very reasonable $30 including tip.  We will definitely return to this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
cathy h.,"Rockwall, TX",10,26,,2.0,10/19/2008,"sooo...jennifer jo calls and asks if i would be interested in drinks or dinner on friday night, sure i say and i get to chose. i picked chilis cause it used to be my favorite and i really wanted chips and hot sauce and their great ranch...that is where the good ended with this trip. we get to our table and we have the most annoying waitress ever, she talks to us like we are in first grade in this really aggravating sing song voice that made me want to punch her. on a good note though, apparently happy hour is all day long every day?  nice.  guess they did that cause the service and the food suck now. we ordered and waited and waited and waited...3 sets of people came in and sat down and ordered and got their food and even one set left, i call sing-song over and say...uh, where is our food?  she goes, its just right in the back waiting for me to get it. WHAT???  i reply nicely, well how bout if you do that?  SINCE WE ARE STARVING TO DEATH.  geesh we didnt get silverware and napkins until we begged for them, sing-song really didnt do a whole lot of upkeep on us and then when it was finally time to leave she screwed up the separate tickets so bad the thought almost crossed my mind to just leave, but i didnt. the ranch and the hotsauce must be a new recipe cause they both sucked, but it must have been good enough to order more chips or maybe me and jen were just starving.  btw, you have to pay for ranch now. maybe not going back for another 2 years or whatever it has been. uck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20

David P.,"San Diego, CA",105,256,21,4.0,2/12/2010,"3.5 stars. So yeah it's a Chilis and its a chain but as far as they go i've never had any major issues with this location. The service is usually pretty decent, clean bathrooms etc. This time we had to stare at the menu for a while because apparently they have changed the menu, the Shanghai wings my wife gets is no longer on there and the Turkey Sandwich I get has been changed. We decided on the 3 appetizer platter(mini burgers, chicken crispers, and boneless wings) The wings were great as usual, the burgers were also very tasty but were definitely well done, and the chicken crispers were a tad overcooked. The molten cake was good but maybe there was too much chocolate on top because once it cooled the shell was almost impossible to crack through, still a darn good cake. One frustration is that the waitress asked if we wanted a drink since it was happy hour. When we ordered the mojito she should have said it wasn't on special. Its a chilis, generally good, usually dependable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20
